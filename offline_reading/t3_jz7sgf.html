    <strong>I swear we just spent 15 years going over "my body my choice" and "what someone does in their bedroom is not the Government's business". Yet here we are talking about mandatory vaccination and banning people from meeting in private residences.</strong>
    <p><p>How quickly it all went down the drain.</p>
<p>Edit: literally not opposed to vaccines or the idea of doing certain things for personal or public safety. I am fully vaccinated to the extent that I can be right now and I do wear a mask / social distance out of social courtesy. But when the Government starts to remove my options <em>not</em> to do these things that I so graciously do, I inclinate towards telling them to fuck off.
Edit: Suspended lol</p></p>

        <p>I've thought the exact same thing.  Here's what the counter-argument will be:  yes it's your body your choice but when your choice to not vaccinate harms me and grandma, it's a different story.</p>
<p>I'm not making that argument.  I don't believe that argument.  That's the argument that the populace has been programmed to believe and make for the last 8 months.</p>
<p>Yes, my body my choice.  Look around reddit and you'll see people who will say yeah, but then we have to throw you into a FEMA camp due to your choice.</p>

        <p>&rt;ere's what the counter-argument will be:  yes it's your body your choice but when your choice to not vaccinate harms me and grandma, it's a different story.</p>
<p>Easily shot down: the risk presented to you by my refusal to vaccinate is minimal. The risk posed to me by an inadequately tested vaccine is anything but minimal.</p>
<p>Anybody who tells you that scientists how found a way to safety speed up the testing process is lying to you. Long term side effects are being looked for, and those don't show up instantly because, well, that's what "long term" means.</p>
<p>I'd then end with an observation of how scary it is that we even have to have this discussion.</p>

        <p>It's also based on this ridiculous notion that the virus is permanently out there, at all times, potentially in everyone you meet-- or worse, you could be an asymptomatic spreader and you just <em>can't prove that you're not</em>.</p>
<p>What a crock of shit. It's so patently not how epidemics work, how virus transmission works, how probability works... But people parrot this view unthinkingly.</p>

        <p>If it is a clump of cells why do you need an operation to take it out? Abortion is murder. I'm not saying it's necessarily bad, it's up for debate whether people should be able to kill babies in their uterus. But the fact that fetuses are alive isn't up for question. Some people think we shouldn't some people think we should, just how it is</p>

        <p>My issue with the person I originally replied to is that they seem to think having sex is consenting to becoming pregnant, which is clearly a dumb take. I'd rather not get into the weeds with you about which moment the fetus becomes alive and when it becomes murder etc. My only point was that, no sex is not purely procreative.</p>

        <p>nobody talks enough about this. there are no positive rights, exactly right. positive rights imply an obligation by one party to comply or conform to another. what we do have are negative rights, to <em>not</em> be infringed upon by another. this is the only consistent way.</p>

        <p>Try explaining that to someone saying they have "a right not to get sick". It's bonkers that people are deluded into thinking they have a right to force others behaviours so they can maybe not get sick, that their fear of a possibility means they have a right to dictate all others lives, in better times we'd call such people hypochondriacs, obsessive maybe even lunatics, and tokenly humour them.</p>
<p>I am seriously so lost and confused why can't we go back to the normal, you do you and I do me mentality? Where people aren't up in eachother's business all the time grandstanding on crap that just lowers everyone's happiness.</p>
<p>If I went back in time to last year and told people that in 2021 you'll need a pass to go outside and do things that's renewed every two days people would call me crazy but apparently that's par for the course these days, and anyone arguing it's crazy is themselves labelled as a conspiracy theorist or some other demeaning label.</p>

        <p>Interestingly enough, in most states <em>knowingly</em> infecting someone with an illness (even HIV/AIDS) is only a misdemeanor; a fairly minor crime. And one would still have to prove that you were the one who knew you had the illness and were the one that infected them. </p>
<p>That precedent pretty much negates any right not to get sick. There is also estoppel in that we have never exercised such a right before despite other illnesses and would therefore be estopped from doing so now. </p>
<p>Of course people do love to make up rights that never existed before anyway.</p>

        <p>It really is fascinating. Two people I follow on YouTube had covid. One with minor symptoms and one asymptomatic. Instead of coming to the conclusion that maybe covid isn’t that bad, they instead expressed this intense shame for ever catching it. They had both been as careful as they could be but the narrative has instilled this weird guilt in everyone. The asymptomatic one said it even made them realize that they needed to take the virus MORE seriously. It’s so eerie to witness stuff like this</p>

        <p>That counter argument that everyone is putting forward falls flat for a number of reasons, but more importantly it's not applied to any other aspect of life.</p>
<p>The most obvious one is every time any of us get behind the wheel of a car we're putting people hundreds of people at risk. But there's a spectrum of negligible risk we subject the public to with even the most innocent activities that could be avoided by just not doing that activity. Cooking can result in a fire, socializing can result in fights, a pet can bite or escape.</p>

        <p>Does it really protect us all? If anyone wants to get vaccinated that’s for their own safety and health and has nothing to do with me. If I don’t get the vaccine and I get covid and die, then that would be my fault. Those who get ‘protect’ themselves from others. So even the ‘‘it doesn’t concern you, it’s for the society and the people you could infect” is flat out bullshit.</p>

        <p>Much of the "my body, my choice" crowd have never really cared about bodily autonomy or medical freedom. They care about abortion rights (which I do support, albeit with reservations) and the right to gay sex (which I also support because I'm bisexual) but would readily force medical treatment ranging from vaccination to intubation to psychotropic drugs on others.</p>

<p>I got laughed at when I mentioned bodily autonomy on Twitter a few months ago. Felt like I was on another planet, thought that it was a commonly held belief after all the "my body, my choice" chants spouted into the ether over the years. I guess people are shallow in their beliefs really.</p>

        <p>How is this at all related to the topic? Should walking in the streets at night be outlawed because people can rape in a dark alleys? Should visiting family members be outlawed or watched by the government because most rapes actually occur between family members? Do you see where I am getting at with this?

        <p>I'm not advocating for anything to be outlawed. I don't believe in The Law any more than an atheist 'believes' in a bible. I'm willing to bet when push comes to shove I'm more "pro-choice" than the majority of people who adopt the label, since I've found they only care about 'choice' and 'freedom' in regard to abortion. I am antigovernment to the core, but I recognize there is right and wrong, and was questioning the genuineness of someone posting they are pro-choice for everything across the board.</p>

        <p>This is not a good counterexample because when you "choose" to murder another human being, you are depriving that other person of a choice in a matter that directly affects them. So supporting your right to rape and murder wouldn't actually be pro-choice.</p>

<p>The implied parenthetical addendum is that you can do whatever you want with your body as long as it isn't hurting others. You can swing your arms around and dance to your heart's content, until your arm hits me in the face, at which case your freedom has to be slightly curtailed.</p>

        <p>If we tackled the drunk driving problem the way we're tackling the coronavirus problem, EVERY vehicle would be equipped with Blow-and-Go technology. After all, we can't tell which drivers are actually drunk, some show no symptoms but are impaired. Then support would be thrown toward limiting alcohol strength allowed to be sold in bars. Beer, wine, and heavily-mixed drinks are fine, but to drink straight hard liquor, you must do so at home.</p>

<p>All I'm reading, is that we should move to zero tolerance regarding alcohol, which seems like a fair idea to me. </p>
<p>Alternatively: the same way you can't drive if drunk because you're a threat to others, you can't be in public spaces if you're not vaccinated. That would work too.</p>

        <p>What "seems like a fair idea" and what actually works in the real world are two different things. Here in PA this spring, our governor decreed his Naughty and Nice lists of businesses, and liquor stores landed on the non-essential side. Turns out that we must prioritize those addicted to alcohol over those at risk of catching a virus, so he had to re-assign and reopen liquor stores.</p>
<p>I am not taking this vaccine for any reason. If you want to feel safer, go ahead and take it yourself. I'll take my chances with the virus we don't know much about over the vaccine we don't know much about.</p>

        <p>&rt; All I'm reading, is that we should move to zero tolerance regarding alcohol, which seems like a fair idea to me. </p>
<p>It may seem like a fair idea at first, but it's absurdly unfair in reality.</p>
<p>The crime to prosecute for is reckless driving. That's how you keep it fair.</p>
<p>Because who cares if its a beer I drank that caused me to hit a child on the sidewalk, or if it was some cough syrup my doctor prescribed? What difference does it make to the child if I was on my cellphone or a little drunk? They are dead either way.</p>
<p>You should not be punished any more or less for killing the child with a cellphone than with a beer. Reckless driving is reckless driving. </p>
<p>Giving the government the power to install alcohol detectors in every car is exactly the idiotic step towards solving nothing, wasting money, and creating unfair incentives for other behavior that always seems to happen in these situations.</p>

<p>Agreed. And it's why 99% of countries have rules forbidding eating, texting, or wanking while driving. Driving is serious business. 
The point of having rules against texting, or DUI, is that the rule severely limits the risk.  </p>
<p>It's the reason there's no gun safety rule worded "We don't give a shit what your line of fire is crossing, the important part is that you don't pull the trigger". You can remove the risk with a simple rule (no drinking, no texting, no pointing a gun at what you're not planning to fire at). </p>
<p>&rt;  Giving the government the power to install alcohol detectors in every car </p>
<p>Lol fuck no, I meant just make it a law, law enforcement already has the gear to check alcohol levels, it would cost nothing.</p>

        <p>I don't give a fuck if someone is drunk driving. I care if they're speeding or swerving. If someone has more alcohol than blood, but you wouldn't know it if you didn't do a breathalyzer, let 'em drive. If they're swerving from lane to lane because they're drunk, texting, having a seizure, reaching for a lit cigarette they dropped, breaking apart a fight between their kids in the back seat, or just a shit driver, maybe pull 'em over. Bad driving is bad driving regardless of cause. Good driving is good driving regardless of sobriety or lack thereof.</p>

        <p>We've spent literally 10,000 years, since the dawn of rigid and oppressive hierarchies that came with agriculture, trying (and largely failing) to get us plebs SOME sort of rights. Only in the last 100 or so years has this actually happened. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that lockdowns have literally thrown 10,000 years of progress towards human rights straight into the trash bin. </p>

        <p>Freedoms and rights (in the legal sense) are a red herring. Nevermind that plenty of these rights are morally <em>wrong</em>. Nature / 'God' confers freedom, not some sophisticate politicians, nor their simpleminded sheeple constituent submissives. It's a jungle out there, and the idea that 'We The People' (eyeroll at the concept of The Unified Collective) must have some manipulative swine write convoluted horseshit down somewhere or otherwise need seek their 'permission' before we can make our own decisions could only stem from a mentality steeped in slavery. Freedom is not granted, this power is <em>taken</em>, and I urge those who are waiting on others to give them the 'okay' to reconsider.</p>

        <p>It usually doesn’t even take that long for the side effects to make themselves known. But good luck arguing your case. 15 years ago, I got a Hep B vaccine and within a month I came down with childhood type 1 diabetes. Chronic disease that will probably be what kills me in the end, one way or another. I’ve had type 1 diabetes predisposition in my family before that -  but predisposition is not a guarantee that you will get it, it just makes it more likely when the right factors come into play. And the way doctors talk about how they have “no idea what causes these autoimmune diseases”, “it’s a civilizational illness”, like come on.  I fully believe the vaccination is what brought it on. The only way me or my kids will get vaccinated is over my dead body.</p>

        <p>Well i commend your unbiased stance. </p>
<p>The question they can't answer why do those who do not wish to vaccinate need to be vaccinated, since those who are vaccinated are already protected.</p>
<p>They have two arguments:</p>
<p>- One being that unvaccinated people will be responsible for further and more rapid mutations. But this is garbage science. Virus's mutate through antigenic shifts or what is also referred to as Recombination where two viruses of the same family infect the same host cell, and this can happen in vaccinated people as well as unvaccinated people and of course animals. Additionally virus's mutate through a number of other methods, and vaccinated people can be quite infectious following the vaccine.</p>
<p>- Two being the disease of burden argument which is purely a financial angle, suggesting that the cost of vaccination is cheaper than the treatment of the disease. Which well, there's a whole lot of money going into these vaccines, and the fact that only a fraction of a percent of people require medical or pharmaceutical intervention once infected, it  suggests that the true cost of treatment would be far lower than they are proposing and they are factoring in the vaccines development and production into their disease of burden costs. With Vaccine coverage being on the rise over the past decade, you would think that hospital visits would have come down but in fact they have risen over the past decade.</p>

        <p>The government tells them what to think. I’m wondering if people are even real. I can’t comprehend how people refuse to believe certain things and believe others. Same could go both ways though. I can’t understand how the majority of the country thought joe Biden was a better fit that Donald trump. (Not that I liked either). I can’t understand how people get so triggered that maybe the government manufactured a virus to gain more control over us. On a side note, cancer is extremely profitable, if the government cared about us they would make it affordable or free. They subliminally push fast food alcohol and tobacco on us. They put pesticides in our food. Do you see where I’m going with this? I can notice patters. I used to be big into conspiracy theories in high school and after but a lot of them seem like less of a stretch as time passes. I’m just totally checked out of “reality” I’m hoping there’s a greater purpose to the place we exist because this shit is dumb and I ain’t about it.</p>

        <p>Hmm. A year ago, I would have told you that lockdowns were not going to come to America any time soon, and seen a lot of support in that, as I cited the clearcut constitutional prohibitions against such a thing. But it happened anyway, by executive whim, and so much for the separation of powers.</p>
<p>The truth is, nobody knows what the state or federal governments will do, next. They've shown that they aren't to be trusted.</p>

        <p>That's not mandatory, and you're speculating. I think it would be plenty reasonable for private businesses to restrict access based in vaccination. Some, like universities, already do. It's legal, not mandatory, and not the government doing it.</p>

        <p>Yes, I did see that. They expect the Pfizer vaccine to be approved by December 11, and to have about 20 million doses distributed within 24 hours after that.</p>
<p>The crucial part you seem to be missing is that he's not talking about forced vaccinations at all, contrary to the tagline added by the moron who uploaded the particular version of the clip you linked to. He's just talking about getting those 20 million doses distributed evenly to the whole country, rather than giving them all to NYC or something.</p>

        <p>They've already authorized pharmacists to give the vaccinations, why does the military need to be involved? For me, that is the crucial part: deploying the military on American soil in order to do something civilians could do and have been doing already. That on top of the previous and current trampling of rights screams "red flag" to me.</p>

        <p>Military's main purpose is to carry out objectives with force. Considering all of these Urban Warfare drills they have been conducting over the last two decades, most without informing the public in advance, I'd say you're trying to explain away him stating clearly, </p>
<p>" Upon emergency use authorization ALL of America MUST receive a vaccine within 24 hours"</p>
<p>When any of the higher ups in the military say "MUST" there is no choice involved. The military doesn't pussy foot around anything. Privates aren't given leeway to debate and interpret orders, everything is clear and direct. That is the problem with the civilian mindset when it comes to things like this. Interpret to your own peril, I'm shooting through the door fuck it.</p>

        <p>Most Americans want a vaccine. The emergency is that, yes, lots of people are dying, and those of us who aren't would like to be protected so that we can go back to earning a living. The limited supply of this highly coveted vaccine should be distributed fairly to the people who need it most, wherever they live.</p>
<p>It also might not hurt to have the military guarding this precious resource, because nutjobs motivated by conspiracy theories and irrational fears of forced vaccinations might try to sabotage or destroy it somehow.</p>

        <p>Most Americans want a tested, safe vaccine that is their choice to take. I'm very mistrustful of the military being involved at this point when it's obvious that those in charge have other things on their mind than our health and that they have no qualms about stepping all over us in order to get us to do what they think we should. In short, the notion of forced vaccination whether the force is physical, social, economic, or some combination thereof is not an irrational fear and it is both disingenuous and short-sighted of you to dismiss it.</p>

        <p>You can personally guarantee that won't happen? Please note that force is not limited to physical coercion. As I said before, economic and social coercion are still ways to force people to accept a vaccine they wouldn't otherwise, just so they can participate in society. We've already seen evidence of corporations from entertainment venues to airlines saying proof of vaccination is necessary to use their services. Why wouldn't it be logical to assume that governments and corporations would be willing to work hand in hand to compel people to get vaccinated or face the consequences, as they are already trying to do with mask mandates and social distancing now?</p>

        <p>Well the unborn aren't <em>alien</em> beings! But hey, it's 2020, biology is just a social construct, anything goes, no consequences, feminism isn't destroying lives and dissolving social cohesion and degenerating culture, nope nope nope. Definitely no connection between the 'ethics' of those who celebrate irresponsibility and where our crumbling civilization is now. All "considerations" are equal and who wants to be considered 'anti-choice'?! "Care, no matter what!" Bumper sticker feels before reals. Sure, let these interests and inclinations and those who hold them up as ideals worth pursuing be 'legitimized' through statist codification, what could possibly go wrong?</p>

        <p>It's not deadly.  99.993% survival rate is not deadly.  Influenza kills more young people than covid does yet I'll bet my next 3 paychecks that you don't wear a mask for that virus that kills every year.  You also didn't wear a mask for H1N1 or any of the other pandemics in recent years.  </p>
<p>Deadly?  Not the virus, but abortions are 100% deadly.  You are literally going to a clinic to have your baby murdered because you're not ready for motherhood, but were not responsible enough to use protection.</p>
