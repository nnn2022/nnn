    <strong>About a music video that eerily foretold the dystopian future...</strong>
    <p><p>Just a few days ago out of nowhere I remembered this music video I used to watch, I remembered how it eerily reminded me of what we are going through now with the face mask mandates, and police takeover. </p>
<p>Please just watch it, and tell me if you're seeing what I am seeing. </p>
<p>How did a music video from the late 90's foretell all of this?... dang. </p>
<p>Also the music video gives me a little bit of the "Soylent Green" vibes, if you see what I mean feel free to say so.

        <p>I like this, had not seen it ever.</p>
<p>Do you feel conflicted about exposing yourself to these images? I can't help but feel a bit superstitious now about all this because our entertainment has been so dystopian driven for decades, it really is like we are creating our own reality. When I go out and have meaningful interaction with a stranger for some reason, suddenly my dread for the future melts away. I love dystopian literature and art, but I am finally asking myself why, really why? Is it all just self perpetuating self prophesizing?</p>

        <p>It is depressing to watch and read things that are dystopian in nature, but at the same time I feel like it prepares me for what's to come if that makes sense. I mean even if I didn't watch or read dystopian stuff it would still play out, these vampiric elites have been planning this for hundreds of years. Just now they have the technology to see it to fruition.</p>

        <p>I felt like that for many years! I still feel like that. But I also feel like maybe my mind is being polluted by fear mongering. I am sure you know what I mean because you KNOW there is crap you need to prepare for. It is a dilemma, but head in the sand is maybe what people like us resist the most? Thanks for the convo. That vid is accurate in many ways I bet. I upvoted you and support your voice.</p>
