    <strong>What could come next</strong>
    <p><p>Today in many countries people went out to protest against the forced vaccination and against any further lockdowns. It will be more and more difficult to keep people silent.</p>
<p>That's equally true for those who took the jab and for those who don't want it.</p>
<p>It's obvious why it is this way for people who don't want the vaccine.
For those who took it, the deception could be overwhelming when the vaccination will not stop the spread of the virus and further restrictions might be applied but governments across the world again... And then again. </p>
<p>The important thing here is to realize that we are actually on the same side. People in power use the old technique 'divide and conquer' or divide and rule in these circumstances. They have already begun a mass campaign in which they accuse the non-vaccinated people being the reason of the newly emerging cases of covid. And they will try to further empower the cleavage process. And the non-vaccinated people will be designated the scape-goat. </p>
<p>The only way to change the situation is for people who are against the vaccination to find common ground with people who already are vaccinated. Even if it is not that easy yet. It will be possible in the near future. 
Unity is crucial. </p>
<p>We must be wary about potential provocative actions the governments could take to discredit the movement. That could go from anything like infiltrating instigators in the crowds of people who do a peaceful march or to organize a more violent crime on a higher level. </p>
<p>I really hope there is someone out there, a person or a group of people, who could give people hope and organize an investigation on a global level and motivate people to defend their rights. </p>
<p>Sorry for the long text and for my non-native English.</p></p>

        <p>Famine is next. I mean maybe economic hardship followed by famine but famine is a huge game changing tactic used in totalitarian regimes.  People go hungry and they don't give a fuck about anything but finding food.</p>

        <p>The cities would crumble…. </p>
<p>I think they want the cities though, they’re easily controllable. I agree that would be their style but it would push people to more rural areas and truthfully, the rural would be more likely to survive. </p>
<p>They want to push complete reliance on the gov, not mistrust. The cities already for the most part  want complete reliance on the gov so there would be no point in taking down their loyal customer base. </p>
<p>I do think it would be something with food but I’m not sure it would be a famine… I’m trying to think of something else it could be.</p>

<p>100%. "Due to lockdown you can't go to work, how about some government money instead? Stay at home and shut your mouth". Overtime as businesses close and people lose money, there will be more of a reliance on the government.</p>
<p>Since businesses and jobs are currently being shutdown, perhaps food is next? If food production starts to have 'problems' then the government can step in once again to 'save' the situation by rationing food to people for 'free'.</p>
<p>This may be followed by a shutdown of the grid. Which the state will also 'fix' by bringing in a new system. One that WEF are calling the 4th industrial revolution. All while big business is funding and pulling the strings. These are people that weren't voted in.</p>

        <p>It's the oldest trick in the book. What makes it difficult is that there is an invisible 'enemy', a virus, that is basically physically isolating people from one another. In turn the solution is a rushed vaccine. A new problem arises amongst people that are skeptical with those that are fearful for their life and those around them. So now you have an invisible enemy and a physical enemy. We are separated physically and psychologically. This is all driven by the same foundational force, fear. This makes it even harder to unite compared to past 'differences' such as race, political ideology or religious belief. It's very cunning on the part of the elite.</p>
