<title>This weekend was the Champions league final in (O)Porto, Portugal, the English fans weren't forced to use masks or to social distancing. Now more and more people are wanting the rules to be eased after seeing the hypocrisy/incompetence of our government</title>

        <p>Media is portraying this as if the British people were the worst devils ridden with covid ready to pass it to the portuguese. And are already making forecasts how the infections will rise because of that.</p>

        <p>It reminds me when there were the celebrations of Sporting and they were shaming and acting like it would be the beginning of a 3rd/4th wave and that 20-30ish people there were gonna drop like flies.</p>
<p>Fortunately I see that more and more people are starting to get fed up of their non-sense propaganda.</p>

        <p>It’s baffling. The QF between Chelsea and Porto took place in Spain to avoid quarantine restrictions when they got back, then they moved the final away from Istanbul for exactly the same reason. Then they hold it in Porto rather than at Wembley?</p>
<p>We might have a bit more sympathy with Covid restrictions if it wasn’t apparent that those with shitloads of money can simply make it up as they go along. </p>
<p>Sceptics and proponents of lockdowns must agree that this is one of the growing number of instances where the restrictions make absolutely no sense.</p>

        <p>It doesn't make any sense, the explanation that I heard that makes the most sense is that the Portuguese Federation of soccer wanted to organise the event as a leverage so Portugal and Spain can organise the World Cup in the future (2028 I think but not sure) and the government just went along.</p>
<p>I hope we can learn a thing or two from the British and be a bit more free.</p>

        <p>Don’t be fooled. We’re likely to see our full reopening on the 21st be reneged on any day now if the fear being peddled in the media is anything to go by. Probably only to be met with general grumbling and a shrug of the shoulders at most. </p>
<p>I’m speaking as an Englishman as well, the Scots, Welsh and Irish have had it even tougher.</p>

        <p>Idk that much about the UK situation tbh but hope that the reopening goes ahead but you are likely right.</p>
<p>I was trying to say that we the Portuguese, should learn from the Brits it's the protests, the not wearing a mask and in general being more defiant than us.</p>
