    <strong>The audacity of some people is unbelievable</strong>
    <p><p>I'm fortunate enough to live in a pretty red state with no lock downs and don't often come across people freaking out about masks, besides chain grocery stores. Most restaurants and gas stations that even have a "Masks required" sign don't say anything when I walk in and pay without one. Even at the Catholic church I regularly attend, maybe one or two people wear a mask. But the church down the street from me is VERY adamant about it. I normally would just avoid it and go to my regular church, but it's so close and convenient for weekday adoration that I bite the bullet, cover my face, and stop by every now and then. Yesterday, I was in there praying for about an hour, so I slipped the mask off my nose to actually breathe. I'm alone in a sea of empty pews with maybe 3 other people in the whole church, and this lady has the nerve to wave me down, literally interrupting me praying on my knees, to give me a death glare and demand I cover my nose. How can someone care about masks SO MUCH that in an EMPTY church they feel the need to approach someone praying and demand I move my mask up an inch?  How pedantic can you be? It seemed incredibly rude. I moved it up so she would walk away. There was another dude on the complete other side of the church doing the same as me and she approached him too. He just ignored her and kept on praying, so I pulled mine back down when she turned away.</p></p>

<p>&rt; 6 “Take care not to practice your righteousness in the sight of people, to be noticed by them; otherwise you have no reward with your Father who is in heaven.</p>
<p>&rt; 5 “And when you pray, you are not to be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they [c]will be seen by people. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full. </p>
<p>I am fairly certain this passage is not used in the Church of Covid.</p>

        <p>I get that you were avoiding confrontation, but you gave her exactly what she wanted. What if you looked exhausted and said, “I’m having trouble breathing, I just need a minute, please don’t give me a hard time over this, it’s been a long day, I’m not near anyone, and I just need to catch my breath. Please don’t interrupt me when I am in prayer again, because when you do you’re interrupting a conversation with God.”</p>
<p>She does it to see you obey her. That’s why she was so emboldened to go to the other guy and do the same thing.</p>
