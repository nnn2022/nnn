    <strong>A well-sourced rant on COVID, the Fat People Elimination Disease</strong>
    <p><p>One of the things that's continued to bother me this entire time is how little attention was paid by the institutes and organizations supposedly looking out for us with regard to co-morbidities we could control for. That is, <strong>our weight</strong>. While we can't control/affect age which seems to be the highest indicator for a co-morbidity caused by the resultant disease, weight is strongly correlated to hospitalization and mortality, second only to old age. In fact, it took until March of 2021 for the CDC to release mortality information tying those medically overweight and obese to mortality.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/30051/20210308/overweight-obese-americans-make-up-78-covid-19-hospitalization-cdc.htm">Among those hospitalized 27.8% were overweight while 50.2% were obese. The CDC defines overweight as having a body mass index of 25 or higher, while obesity has a BMI of 30 or more.</a> In other words, 78% of hospitalizations from March to December 2020 were clinically fat. We have even better information than this though, <a href="https://www.worldobesityday.org/assets/downloads/COVID-19-and-Obesity-The-2021-Atlas.pdf">check out page 20 from the World Obesity report</a>, I quote:</p>
<p>&rt;Globally, at the end of 2020, COVID-19 mortality rates were <strong>more than ten times higher</strong> in countries where overweight prevalence exceeds 50% of adults (weighted average 66.8 deaths per 100,000 adults) compared with countries where overweight prevalence is below 50% of adults (weighted average of 4.5 deaths per 100,000 adults). Equally, COVID-19 mortality rates are similarly significantly higher in countries where average adult BMI exceeds 25 kg/m2."</p>
<p>You want to be an actual hero? <strong>Try running a calorie deficit for a year if you are overweight and be responsible with your health</strong>. Use whatever strategy you want, vegan, carnivore, fasting, I don't care. I believe the average adult American male weight was 160 lbs in the 1950s. What is it now, 220? 230? Did our genetics collectively evolve in the span 60 years? No. By all accounts, this is a fat person elimination disease (again, 8 in 10 hospitalizations).</p>
<p>That said, the authoritarians want to remove all individual's sovereignty over their own body to force them to risk <strong>literal experimental injections</strong> that cannot stop the spread, do not stop mutation and some argue <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-vaccines-can-drive-pathogens-to-evolve-20180510/">put additional environmental stresses to encourage virus mutation</a>, and serve only to potentially lessen the symptoms of those who are infected, if they even express symptoms at all as health officials totally discount individual risk and those likely to have strong immune responses naturally. It's <strong>Insane</strong>, especially in the context of the current excess deaths count by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm">CDC's own numbers (see table midway down the page).</a></p>
<p>Despite the seemingly pervasive presence of the Delta variant, mortality is flattened, the curve is currently flattened to the 5-year average, and the media blitz and political pressure that is and has been driven by "Case Count" to manufacture fear and subsequent compliance is running on continued <em>deliberate</em> public ignorance and inertia as the <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2021/07/28/cdc-revokes-eua-on-pcr-discontinues-use-in-december/">CDC just revoked EUA of the PCR "test" (manufacturing process) 2 weeks ago</a> which has been the main driver for finding asymptomatic "Cases" this entire time. Although now <em>finally</em> recognized as completely invalid (just ask Kary Mullis, oh wait...), they won't discontinue use of PCR "testing" until December of course for, presumably, political expedience and public pressure campaigns to force injection compliance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the institutional focus, from day one, has always been on Vaccination as <em>the only solution</em> to getting out of this declared pandemic, not losing weight, which is the <a href="https://www.worldobesityday.org/assets/downloads/COVID-19-and-Obesity-The-2021-Atlas.pdf">single greatest predictor of hospitalization and mortality from COVID</a>. Instead, you have every incentive by the captured regulators who regularly join the companies they used to regulate to lucrative executive positions, the politicians whose campaigns get funded by the Pharma lobbyists, and the academic institutions who are influenced by industry funding and tailor research accordingly to make sure the <strong>vaccinate or else</strong> narrative is continually reinforced. It would impossible to pretend that objectivity is ruling the day when billion$ in <a href="https://business.inquirer.net/322332/pfizer-sees-covid-19-as-durable-revenue-stream-as-profits-rise">"durable revenue streams"</a> are at stake for companies who have <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/03/17/2020-05484/declaration-under-the-public-readiness-and-emergency-preparedness-act-for-medical-countermeasures">zero liability for adverse effects</a> from their experimental injections up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Dww5ticg4">mass death (1 min)</a>.</p>
<p>These people, these systems we abide by and trust, are full of a bunch of <em>fucking liars</em> and at this point I can put this no other way, <strong>people are utter fools to trust their health to them</strong>.</p></p>

        <p>Definitely, the report details that age is the number one predictor of hospitalization AND mortality, but that's not controllable. Weight 100% is controllable, as the second highest predictor.</p>
<p>As for whether the virus was designed, that's still controversial, but definitely worth discussing.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I think the SS/Medicare aged population had to be killed off first. That would free up a lot more money for the illegitimate government officials to embezzle. I'd be actually surprised if the obese were targeted to be killed next because with inflation they spend an outrageous amount of money on food therefore keeping them enslaved.</p>

        <p>On one hand I agree that it would be convenient from a Social Security insolvency perspective; however, they simply print and issue money at will now and I don't think many officials are concerned about solvency or even the stability of the currency in the long term. Central Bank Digital Currencies we already know are the long term aim of the authoritarian political puppets.</p>
<p>Frankly, if we are going to look at this from a Malthusian + globalist + peak oil point of view, I think it's convenient for them to eliminate large quantities of consumers, no matter what flavor they are in high energy life-style western countries and eventually replace them with masses of people who tolerate various forms of uncomplicated slavery.</p>

        <p>So do fat people significantly skew general mortality rates? I am curious to know what the overall mortality rate would be compared to the flu if we were to compensate by removing overweight and obese deaths from the final tally, including only deaths among healthy weighted individuals no matter what age they were when they died or what other non-weight related comorbidities they had.</p>
