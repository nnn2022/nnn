    <strong>A friendly reminder to ignore the Messages where you got banned for participating in NNN</strong>
    <p><p>I know many of you are annoyed with this despite you have never heard of or participated in those subs.</p>
<p>But here are 2 reasons they doing this to people that never participated in those subs:</p>
<p>1.To send out a message to people outside of their community not to participate in NNN without getting tagged as harassment or spam.</p>
<p>2.To trigger some hot headed users into replying to those PM in a rude/arrogant manner, which can then be used as evidence for harassment which is a serious offense on Reddit's TOC which will most likely warrant a PERMANENT Ban. Yes Permanent. How do i know? Because i have reported a user for sending rude PMs to me, and the next day i received a notification from admins telling me the user has been permanently banned, was i surprised? You bet. Did i felt bad. Yes a little. The guy came back with an alt with another PM but i just ignored it coz i want him to keep his new alt.</p>
<p>So if you don't see much value in participating in those subs, just ignore the bans. They aren't blanket banning all their own members because this would reduce their sub's popularity and ranking, so they are doing this to people outside their subs. To get folks not related to their subs banned. They do ban a few of their members as warnings to others.</p>
<p>However if you really treasure or enjoy participating in those subs, i would suggest you send a kind pm back to the mods promising that you will never participate in NNN anymore. We will understand, you have to pick your sides. Most redditors are here for fun so go ahead.</p></p>

        <p>Excellent message.  Yelling at the mods just makes all of us look bad and the mods here have no visibility over any of that.</p>
<p>By the way,  please stop spreading "misinformation", lol.</p>
<p>&rt;USER REPORTS<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;1: This is misinformation</p>
<p>Now that you mention it, I have been seeing a lot more shadowbanned accounts lately which makes my job much harder because I have zero visibility on their history so I don't know if they are trolls or what.</p>

        <p>Just report those messages for spam which they are. I don't care about your sub and you shouldn't send automated messages to random users. It's rude.</p>
