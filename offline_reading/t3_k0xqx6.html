    <strong>To those of us in a dark headspace feeling numb and unable to go on..</strong>
    <p><p>Been seeing a lot of "I don't know how much longer I can take it" posts here. I'm with you guys in a lot of ways, where I've become desensitized to the madness, in order to protect my own sanity. I can't really talk to most of my friends or family anymore because I consider them to be different levels of indoctrinated to the narrative. I've been isolated mostly just to stay away from the hive-mind bullshit. Feeling out of control in life makes you crave escape through substance or content. However, these comforts put us in a complacent state that doesn't help serve our cause or protect our rights. I think as more people are awakening, and we approach a vaccine release, tensions will culminate and times will get harder before we start to see some light on the other side. </p>
<p>I hate to tell anyone to buck-up, but I think this is truly a time to be alert, pay attention to the writing on the wall, embrace discomfort in preparation for times of uncertainty, uprising, and probably worse things to come. Many just want to check-out and see how things play out, but by doing so, we're taking a backseat and allowing the propaganda-pushers to win. We need to impose our knowledge where we can, keep sharing/ posting science based in logic, and uniting with like-minded individuals and groups. They can be hard to find, but even having someone who will listen with an open mind can be a huge relief. You must learn to be okay with the separation/ alienation from old friends and family in the search for truth, and that you are justified in your thinking. We can't confront them aggressively, only answer them with love and kindness, knowing we all have the same collective needs.</p>
<p>Subs like this have given me a lot of paranoia, but also a lot of hope. It's a time where I feel more than justified in my paranoia and obsessive alternative researching, and you should too. Resistance to the vaccine and the regulations surrounding is going to be far greater than "they" could have imagined. Mass vaccination of healthy individuals is not a logical idea, and I think there are enough intelligent people out there to realize that. The media will try to undermine us, make us seem like an insignificant, idiotic group, but it's more like half the world that's going to fight this. It's going to get nasty and uncomfortable, but I encourage you to welcome this period of discomfort or pain, knowing there could be a much brighter world on the other side.</p>
<p>Get outside in the cold, do some physical labor and exercise, go a day or two without eating, telling yourself you're strong and CAN HANDLE ANYTHING. A bit of physical pain goes a long way in battling depression or toxic thoughts, and makes you feel alive again. Imagine you're training for the apocalypse, knowing that you'll need to be a lot harder and a lot less comfortable to survive. Though I also feel the need to escape often, drinking/ smoking yourself into oblivion each night isn't helping anything. It's uncomfortable to be sober, but in doing so you realize where your focus should be, and you'll have more energy to apply it. </p>
<p>We need to be prepared to stand up proudly and angerly in defense of our rights at a moment's notice. It's easy to drift into fantasizing about suicide, but let's hold off on that until we've been forced to have the digital covid tattoo/ implant while being moved into the mega-cities. Until then, maintain a positive attitude, plenty of hope, and listen to your intuition. Know that people are waking up by the thousands every day. It has those in power scrambling to rush their plan along and censor everything, which is only making people more suspicious. </p>
<p>Finally, endless LOVE to each of you struggling in these times. I can't tell you how helpful just knowing other people are out there questioning the news media doctrine and authority. I would be seriously lost without you guys and wish you all courage and strength moving forward. &lt;33</p></p>

        <p>I've definitely been one of those "i don't know how much longer i can take" kinds of people I'll admit. I've kind of settled on numbing myself to the insanity at least for the rest of winter, until the end of January where i think things will start getting interesting again.</p>
<p>But you're right, our cause is just enough that we'll need all the people we can get. I've made up my mind what side I'll be on, if the time comes for a resistance against the powers that be. I'm mainly just waiting for someone to lead the charge, so to speak.</p>

        <p>Numbing yourself can unfortunately be a tool of necessity these days. At least you're paying attention and know what side you'll be on. Just prepare for them to strip away conveniences/ luxuries, and even some dignity when you've taken that side, so I'm saying it would be useful for some of us to toughen up. I'm not sure it's worth waiting for a leader of the resistance to emerge, because I'm not sure any of us would fully trust them if they did.</p>

        <p>Good points. Instead of feeling like a victim, consider, "What am I doing to fight this?" Be the resistance. Almost everyone can do something, especially when we join together with like-minded people. Millions of people are ignoring the government's advice and traveling to family get-togethers on Thanksgiving. We're far from alone in noticing the deception and insanity.</p>

        <p>I am definitely of the opinion that the war is already lost, the masses have been conditioned too deeply to wake up. But then again I am a genuinely suicidal person and not afraid to admit that on some level I WANT this dystopia to happen so that I have something to actually fight, a purpose.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I understand that feeling too well. I get very discouraged by people's inability to think for themselves, and in many cases refuse anything you try to tell them. Then there's part of me that knows there are a ton of naturalists, independent thinkers, skeptical minorities, and libertarian "rednecks" who are going to band together and refuse to comply at all costs. There is a lemming section of the population (20%?) that will line up to take an experimental vaccine, but even less who will want a digital implant. I'm not convinced we've lost, but I've still resigned to the idea that I may very well end up in an isolation camp in the next couple years (with my people!).. But, they can't put over half the population in camps without encountering some major resistance and rebellion. The Reset plan has some effective leverage points by controlling/ collapsing the economy, virus scare tactics, mass power outages, debt forgiveness programs, etc. However, the scale can only tip so far in way of totalitarianism before forces of good and righteousness awaken and step in to balance it again. Militias will form, military forces will turn against their orders, grassroots communities will pop up with support of local farms. That's just the way of history. So, perhaps they are "winning" now, but I imagine a dark period of up-rise, where people realize what's happening in mass and unite to stop it. The internet continues to be a hell of a tool in people's awakening, until it's no longer available. Stay hopeful my friend, take care of yourself, and reach out if you ever need to talk &lt;3</p>
