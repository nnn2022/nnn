    <strong>The Only Reason Virtue Signallers Bang On About Masks and Staying Home is Because the Situation is Mild Enough to Allow Them To</strong>
    <p><p>Imagine the modern world with an actual plague, the modern equivalent of the Black Death or worse, and then imagine all these idiots yelling about masks and distancing. If there were a real plague that killed at \~40% or greater and spread to everyone, government and police would be next to useless. People wouldn't just stay inside and wait for grocery delivery. Groceries wouldn't come. Grocery workers would never go to work. Everyone who is 'sheltering in place' would flee the cities, they'd do anything they could to save themselves and their families. They would flee like they have in the past, like here:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_Riots">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera_Riots</a> </p>
<p>or here:</p>
<p>&rt; The New York Evening Post reported, “The roads, in all directions, were lined with well-filled stagecoaches, livery coaches, private vehicles and equestrians, all panic-struck, fleeing the city, as we may suppose the inhabitants of Pompeii fled when the red lava showered down upon their houses.” </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/science/15chol.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/science/15chol.html</a> </p>
<p>All these panic buying idiots on the news - everyone would be one. Actually no sorry, everyone would wildly grab whatever they can while they can. There wouldn't be a chance to arrest wealthy people fleeing to holiday homes - police wouldn't even go to work. Why would you go to work and crash tackle anti-maskers when there's a 50% chance it could kill you? If there were literally people dying in the streets there's no way you'd stay on those streets. Why would you give a shit what a governor says if by the end of the week there actually was a big chance you'd be dead? People would take their loved ones out of aged care (there wouldn't be any carers left) and head for the hills. Rural communities would close to outsiders. </p>
<p>Imagine if it was like this (a quote from the Black Death):</p>
<p>&rt; "They died by the hundreds, both day and night, and all were thrown in ... ditches and covered with earth. And as soon as those ditches were filled, more were dug. And I, Agnolo di Tura … buried my five children with my own hands … And so many died that all believed it was the end of the world." </p>
<p>Anyone really think we'd be bitching about people not wearing masks or driving 5km to exercise? </p>
<p>The contradiction in doomers' reality lies in the fact that the only reason these virtue signallers have the opportunity to lecture about masks and staying inside and tell us how deadly the virus is and how it's going to kill all the old people is because the virus is not deadly. The only reason we've listened to lockdowns and let our rights be taken from us is because the virus is very, very mild.</p></p>

        <p>"Lockdown" by the privileged and wealthy is only made possible by an army of workers generating their power, supplying their water, clearing their sewers, growing their food, cooking their food, delivering their food, fixing their fiber lines, etc etc. </p>
<p>The EXTREME mildness of this disease is the only thing making this response tenable. "Stay at home" ceases to become feasible when the workers of the world stop coming to your house to do shit for you.</p>

        <p>Covid is truly the most bourgeois disease ever. This is why it's disgusting that these people have the gall to call themselves "leftists". They don't even see workers as actual real human beings, otherwise they wouldn't be doing any of this shit. A 0.2% IFR virus, that the vast majority of people don't even have a single symptom from, that only "kills" the old and infirm who would have died the same year from their other ailments. #stayhomesavelives is such a sick stupid joke because society cannot function one day without millions of workers running it. The top 10% staying home and collecting their full paychecks or living off their massive bank accounts while watching Netflix and making stupid videos of themselves enjoying life in their nice, comfortable homes while at the same time they want to believe a horribly deadly plague is raging outside. It's unbelievable how out-of-touch with common sense and reality these people are. These privileged, obtuse morons want to virtue-signal and LARP an apocalyptic pandemic because it makes them feel good and important. There is a massive disconnect between reality and what these people say and do. Either they are truly this stupid, and they have no clue how society functions and how many workers have been out there every single day making their cushy comfy lives possible...or they truly do not care.</p>

        <p>And they enjoy the situation and want to milk it. This post is just one of many examples. This guy wants to work from home forever so he doesn’t have to commute and can sleep in. Like I get the appeal but imagine being so entitled that those are the reasons you think you deserve a permanent remote job: </p>

        <p>I have been working from home since mid March. I used to commute just over an hour on a train to London every morning at around 7am and back at half 4. The lockdown has meant I get extra sleep and have saved money but I am no longer as effective at my work. Missing the office atmosphere and colleagues. It's nice and all working from home but not permanently please. It feels like I have lost out on developing friendships and skills at work.</p>
