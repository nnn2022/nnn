        <p>It's a manipulation tactic to force people into their bidding. My mother used to use it on my all the time growing up.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>I would want to dress the way I liked to as a teenager, which was a semi-goth way. My mother would scream that it was inappropriate, and I looked like a "Satanist". She would allege I was being selfish for this, because I made her look bad. I would try to rebel, and dress like this anyway, in the beginning. But every argument and shaming tactic she employed made me more reluctant to do so. I would eventually cave into her demands, and dress how she wanted. </p>
<p>This is what is currently happening, on a worldwide scale.</p>

        <p>Of course they aren‚Äôt on our side, they think we are the authoritarians. The ones that were woke in college are using the BLM front because it‚Äôs attracting hopeless uneducated people they can use as pawns. It‚Äôs really sad.</p>
<p>Frankly I‚Äôm not sure is half of them even know what side they are on, or what they are even doing any of this for.</p>

        <p>I hate how everything gets political in America. I mean I don‚Äôt support authoritarianism when cops are abusing power, racially discriminating, and using force against peaceful protestors....
But I also don‚Äôt support authoritarianism in the form of dictating who/how many people I can physically associate with, what I can buy/sell, or live my life in general. </p>
<p>There is a segment of the population that is trying to say people not willing to submit to authority when it fits their narrative are facists. I mean the same ones who think protesting in music festival sized crowds is okay (depending on why you are protesting) but people can‚Äôt have funerals of more than 10 attendees.</p>

        <p>Why did Trump just say everyone needs to wear a mask?  Then say he couldnt do his rally because of covid? Hes part of the conspiracy. Or maybe just losing potential votes pretending the virus isnt real.</p>

<p>üôÑ Sorry but this advice is complete bullshit. I get tired of people saying this. "Just go outside, and live life normally! It's super easy!" No, it's fucking not. Not when you have neighbors and others in public micro-managing you! Not when you need to make appointments or stand in long queues if you want to go somewhere! Not when you are forced to wear a mask at <strong>all</strong> times like my state mandates (and yes, people here do enforce it, or they fucking sic cops on you or worse)! Nothing about this normal, and I can't trick my mind into believing it is.</p>

<p>What exactly do you mean by this? They make nasty comments? Who gives a fuck. Stop caring so much what other people think.</p>
<p>&rt;sic cops on you or worse</p>
<p>Is this something you've seen first hand or in some video? I thought it would be like invasion of the body snatchers boarding the subway or walking into a store without a mask before the mandates came where I am, people would film me and call the news, randos would attack me, cops would swoop in, etc. The truth is aside from a few places refusing to serve you and one fat guy trying to block me from boarding a crowded elevator nothing's happened. Those videos like everything in the media are propaganda pieces designed to scare you into compliance. They blow up one incident and make you think it's commonplace. And the ones I've seen the person in them makes a scene and throws a tantrum about their face being uncovered instead of quietly carrying on normally. Do randos pull guns on you over this? I don't mean have you heard about it on the news I mean have you seen it happen is this a real regular occurence.</p>
<p>Just walk around like you got a big penis and you'll be left alone. Sorry to break it to you fams but if you don't want people messing with you you can't comport yourself as someone who gets messed with. Stock up on creatine and start hitting the weights (real weights if you can access a gym but pushups dips and shitty dumbbells at home are better than nothing) it'll help with your self confidence and build that strength for the odd chance one of these beta males leaves the internet and tries something. Carry those principles into the real world. We'll never get through this if we are deterred by nasty comments and judgemental glares. Sack up a little eh.

        <p>Oh, I love how your response to me is to basically chastize me. I just <strong>love</strong> people like you, who come here to do that.</p>
<p>&rt; Is this something you've seen first hand or in some video?</p>
<p>It's happened to me. I've re-told the stories many, many times on this sub, so if you are curious go look for it in my comment history. I'm tired of having to recount it to people like you.</p>
<p>&rt; Just walk around like you got a big penis and you'll be left alone. Sorry to break it to you fams but if you don't want people messing with you you can't comport yourself as someone who gets messed with. </p>
<p>I'm not a man, but thanks for making the assumption. Even still, you are ignorant. Because even "tough guys" still get cops called on them, and people are now getting physically assaulted, and even killed over this crap.</p>
<p>But nah, "just go outside, and live normally! LOL! And if you don't, you're a worthless sack of shit! BYE!"</p>

        <p>Look I've seen enough in your post history to recognize a doom spiral. You desperately need some fresh air and sunshine and a break from social media so you don't go completely fucking miserable. They want you to give up. They want you to fall apart and destroy yourself, cut yourself off from the world stop engaging with your community and ultimately, for you to kill yourself. COVID is a death cult. Some days I also want to kill myself but I keep on out of spite. </p>
<p>Maybe there is or isn't a silent majority of people who are done with this but when I go out I don't see the same world that social media shows with the cancel mob and the snitching neighbours and the police state. A bunch of fat women and dweeby guys are walking around in masks but the majority of people aren't and they're not doing that 6 metres apart crap either except to line up at a store. Even in places where it's mandatory anywhere from 5-50% aren't wearing them (varies greatly, my local coffee shop has maybe a 10% compliance with the mask mandate) and half are doing it wrong. Life in Toronto is coming back to normal despite the legislation and propaganda that says otherwise.</p>
<p>My point is that the media's and government's messaging that there's an overwhelming consensus of true believers and the only opponents are a few lone heretics is false. It's a manufactured propaganda piece. Reddit and Twitter is literally 50% bots and a good remainder are paid shills (China, Russia, Amazon, Pornhub, take your pick...) while the most prolific posters are those who interact with the real world the least. Facebook and Instagram are closer to reality but it's still distorted. You ever notice on Facebook you see a disproportionate portion of dumbass memes and cartoons from a few teachers (fat women and soy-faced dweebs - again the connection can't be denied, weak body leads to weak mind) claiming there'll be a pile of dead kids if the schools reopen? That's by design. Everything you see on social media is filtered through the lens they want to show you. It is a manufactured image of public opinion that in no way represents the real world. Most people I talk to about this in the real world think it's all theatre, an absurd over-reaction to an overestimated threat. They have kids who miss their friends and sports and jobs and businesses they worry about and the masks itch and no-one they know has even had the virus let alone died from it. </p>
<p>I work food delivery so my whole day is spent going in and out of places where the mask is mandatory. Very few people give a shit. I've been refused an order at a couple places and the Dufferin Mall door security says sir please wear a mask but inside the security don't give a shit the staff don't give a shit and the general public doesn't give a shit. One time a fat man started making a scene when I boarded the elevator and started yelling at the concierge not to let me back to the condo and in another condo lobby when I was sitting on the taped off couches eating my lunch this scrawny dude photographed me but the calling of cops and the throwing of punches and the shooting you hear about online just doesn't happen as much as you've been led to believe. Again, those are cherrypicked stories designed to scare you into compliance. </p>
<p>I've had legal gym for a week now and almost no-one there wears a mask either despite the City bylaw and the signs threatening to revoke membership for violating it. Again, it's all theatre. The bureaucrats are among the only people who genuinely give a shit about COVID. Dr Theresa Tam says life won't be normal for 3 years and most people go lol what a nutcase and go drink beers in the park with their friends and ignore the stupid white circles on the grass. The cops roll around on bikes and write tickets to the odd drunk idiot just to make a point that public drinking is technically illegal but otherwise don't give a shit they're not interrogating people to confirm if they have a 10-person social bubble or whatever the limit is these days.</p>
<p>No offense but you sound like one of those people who feel unsafe walking past the crackhead corners. They hit you up for change and scream nonsense and some of them might steal your bike if you got a nice bike and a cheap lock you walk away from but they don't randomly attack people and steal their wallet like Redditors all think. I bike through shitty neighbourhoods where needles litter the sidewalks all the time and haven't once feared for my safety. Muggings aren't a real thing just like COVID police aren't a real thing. You need to go outside and clear your head, go visit some friends, it may or may not be illegal but not many real people really give a shit.</p>

        <p>But 1 in 10,000 death/injury rate is not bad. You could inject sterile water, or even blood, into your veins and there would be risk involved. If the death/injury rate is better than the death/injury rate of the disease, isn't it worth it?</p>

        <p>Tbh I think vaccinations are great, but many scientists have warned about false hope here. They are fast tracking vaccines that even if safe may not be effective. It‚Äôs creating this ridiculous concept of shutting things down ‚Äúuntil a vaccine or cure‚Äù which we have never held such a standard for any other disease in human history.</p>

        <p>I would personally assess my risk from taking a rushed vaccine to be significantly higher than my risk from the virus, as a healthy 27 year old. So yeah, I agree we don't know it's dangerous but it sure seems more likely than the virus being so, at least in my case.</p>

        <p>Yes, am in the UK - and pubs were allowed to open for people to drink alcohol all day long in crowded indoor settings,  but gyms were not.  What a complete joke.  </p>
<p>Alcohol is known to cause illness and death (yeah, like the people in the pub from 11am are drinking responsibly and limiting their units!) - exercise is known to boost immunity and is the number one prescription for mental health, but - go drink, but do not exercise...</p>

        <p>It's weird though, now that gyms are opening we can go there and sweat all over the place in a small room with other people YET we can't buy food without a mask.</p>
<p>And it's mad how they mandated masks in EVERY shop. If I can go in a gym and a pub, why can't each town have just ONE shop where unmasked people can buy a loaf of bread?! I'm sure some shopkeepers would agree.</p>

        <p>There have been studied that have showed children have gained weight, for example, and this has serious consequences. I haven't see one on adults but there are enough people posting about how their clothes don't fit to conclude a study there if not done already would be interesting. </p>

        <p>The gyms closing have really affected my mental health. I never feel like I get a decent workout at home, for whatever reason, so I would go to my apartment complex's gym, get on a treadmill or elliptical, turn the incline all the way up, and read a book for an hour. I have severe depression and OCD, and this calmed me. I get too nervous to sit around my house and read, but the treadmill let me do it. I've lost that. My weight has not changed, fortunately - due to the depression, I lose weight and get uncomfortably skinny easily - but I have lost muscle. I have a hard time keeping any muscle on, but I figured out what worked. I now walk about 8 miles a day, just to kill the time, but without the incline, my legs look different. </p>
<p>I want a reduction in rent, if they insist on keeping the gym closed.</p>

        <p>I have, yes, at least that's one of several being developed around the world. As I said I won't be getting it myself. Referring to it as a highly dangerous substance isn't going to get you anywhere with them. You won't be taken seriously. You'll be labelled an anti-vaxxer and dismissed as crazy.

        <p>I already said I am aware of the issues. I won't be getting it myself at this stage and see no reason to with such a low risk virus and a rushed vaccine. You're not comprehending what I am saying. By using heightened language such as <em>dangerous substances</em> NO ONE other than those who feel the same way to that exact extreme is going to take what you are saying seriously.</p>
<p>Even those who are concerned and on the fence themselves will dismiss you as a loon.  They see that and dismiss what you have to say even if what you have to say following that description has merit. </p>
<p>It's psychology. If you wish to make a point and be taken seriously, such language is doing you no favours and even those on your side - those against forced vaccination or concerned about any rushed vaccine - are likely to dismiss you.</p>
<p>Also, they won't be strapping people down to do so so that's correct. If they were use to use force, it would be disguised force. You can't travel if you haven't been vaccinated (that was a thing in the past for some diseases). You can't visit family in nursing homes if not vaccinated (already happening here if you haven't had the flu vaccine you can't visit now). Your children can't attend public daycare or schools (already happening here where I am with other vaccines). You can't access government family benefits if your kids aren't vaccinated (already a thing here and perhaps they'll expand that to adults not vaccinated can't access benefits). You can't go to work if not vaccinated (already a requirement if you work in a hospital etc).</p>
<p>They will give you no ability to live your normal life without being vaccinated and that's how they will, if they do, force people to comply. Though there are absolutely those who would support tying people down and forcibly injecting them...</p>
<p>There's already a traffic light health app that can be scanned and I believe the USA and UK are among those to have signed contracts with. If it's green you're good to go, if it's orange your freedom is limited, if it's red you're confined to your house. Disturbing idea.</p>

        <p>This was fine except for the first one. The anti-vaccine stuff sends a giant chill down my spine because I‚Äôd rather not agree with these people on anything if possible</p>
<p>Anti-vaxxer stuff jeopardizes the credibility of everyone else that‚Äôs also skeptical about the covid response. You should at least hide that you think this if you want to win over more people lol</p>

        <p>Eh, if you did the people who already agree with you would call you out and it would create infighting which is not beneficial to the movement which actually is organic for once, lol. It is what it is, the good thing is people who don't identify as anti-vaxxer are starting to hear and identify with those of us who see the agenda behind all of this. They're actually engaging in a civil conversation. Hell, I couldn't even get someone to consider where I was coming from because they wouldn't even sit down and have a discussion about all this. Baby steps my friend, and in all honesty we're making leaps and bounds now, lol! Keep up the good work. No regrets.</p>

        <p>instead of getting mad at different sides actions,  I think we should all focus on the real problem - our endlessly corrupt government that is purposely creating this rift in our population to keep things the same. In conclusion we do need a new normal, one that includes everyone.</p>

        <p>I don't call anyone "selfish" in this circumstance - while I don't share many of your misgivings about masks (a rushed vaccine, however, does worry me), I can often understand where those misgivings come from. I do wonder, however, when fear becomes justified for setting public policy. Post-9/11, the US instituted sweeping changes in airport and airplane security screening and law enforcement and instituted a number of drastic changes on surveillance, rendition policies and drone strikes in the name of combating Islamic terrorism. However, terrorism in general, with the exceptions of 1995 (Oklahoma City) and 2001 (9/11), kills fewer Americans per year than people under 25 who have died from COVID, and even those terrorism deaths are not all (not even mostly) the result of Islamic terrorists. When is fear validated for setting policy?</p>
<p>(I realize not everyone here is American; for that, I apologize. This was just the most prominent example I could think of in my lifetime and experience)</p>

        <p>On top of that terrorism exploded across the globe world wide, but the MIC (military industrial complex) made and continues to make money hand over fist. Hell, even in the midst of this pandemic one can easily verify that the war on terror efforts have increased and the MIC hasn't lost any of it's funding unlike every other industry the general public interacts with regularly. Matter of fact I believe the "Live Safe" app that is being beta tested at James Maddison University as a requirement to enter campus, the company behind this app is located in Arlington Virginia....same as the Pentagon...eh I'm sure it's nothing....here's the link to JMU's "Return To Campus Plan" if you're interested.....<a href="https://www.jmu.edu/stop-the-spread/_files/campus-reopening.pdf">https://www.jmu.edu/stop-the-spread/_files/campus-reopening.pdf</a></p>

        <p>Someone clarify for me--are you guys talking about all vaccines bad? Polio, TB, etc? Or do you mean specifically the covid vaccine. I mean, I won't get the covid vaccine because I know the survival rate. But your standard vaccines like polio, etc.? Come on.</p>
<p>If you guys are against all vaccines ever, can you start your own antivax or conspiracy sub and take your thoughts on the matter over there? It's starting to dominate lockdown skeptic subs, and it's not germaine to the issue at all--unless(!) you are talking specifically about the covid vaccine, then carry on. But maybe specify that as such, otherwise it confuses a reasonable concern about a rushed c19 vaccine with loony antivax crap I, and 95% of the populous do not want to be associated with.</p>

        <p>&rt;  Or do you mean specifically the covid vaccine. I mean, I won't get the covid vaccine because I know the survival rate.</p>
<p>No, most of us are not anti-vax in general. However we are anti-covid vax. The fastest they've ever put out a vaccine is 4 years, it is highly likely that if a vaccine comes out very soon that it will not have been tested enough and could contain long term complications (see 1976 swine flu vaccine). A large portion of us are also afraid of this rushed unsafe vaccine being made mandatory.</p>

        <p>I don't identify as being anti-vaccine, though to clarify, my son hasn't had any and I don't plan on him getting any as long as I'm his father and alive but I have no objections to anyone choosing to give their own kid's vaccines. I am against mandatory/compulsory vaccination in order to participate in regular industries. The last vaccine I had I immediately was sick and it knocked me out of summer school. Never had one since and I can count on one hand the times I was sick 20 years later. That is not the reason I have the view point I do now, just an interesting coincidence. My current stance came after I observed several friend's kids having moderate to severe reactions, 100% of them immediately after being vaccinated. I did research and quite honestly the actual science truly is rampant with mixed results and inconclusive results, along with conflicts of interest (way more common than you would expect) and laws that completely exempt ALL vaccine companies from liability. A lot of red flags in my opinion. Eh, that's my personal perspective on the issue, a big no on my participation, but I'm not against anyone believing the narrative. To each his own....just hate being lumped in with those who are <em>perceived</em> as unreasonable.</p>

        <p>I think you've missed the point here, friend. If everything we do affects someone else, how do we live? How do you know that you haven't "taken someone with you?" Given someone the flu? Said something mean, even to poke fun, and caused someone to kill themselves? Advocated for a new normal that kills more than it saves? Where does the blame and controlling behavior end?</p>
<p>I don't think you're a doomer. I understand that you're concerned for the health of yourself and others. Sorry someone called you that. Please be better than them and stop coming here to poke fun. We want civil discussion.</p>

        <p>No matter what you do the possibility of death always looms, even for something relatively mundane like taking out the garbage. Some drunk driver could hit you outside your own home on your street after a late night with friends. That is probably more likely than you catching Covid ironically....js</p>

        <p>They've already banned drunk driving and people still do it and die from it. The only control you have over that is not doing it yourself and yet it is still a possibility. Statistically, you have a 1 and 161,856 chance of getting struck by lightening. Dying by car accident a 1 and 114. Of dying of COVID you have 1 and 19.1 million chance of dying if you're 50-64 years of age which means it is even lower for people who are younger. I know it is difficult for you to admit you have been duped but the stats are what they are. Sorry.</p>

<p>My point is that it‚Äôs not selfish to not want to share the road with a drunk driver. Not that banning drunk driving has eliminated drunk driving. In the same vein it‚Äôs not selfish to want people in public to wear masks. Further by your logic drunk driving is fine because ‚Äúpsssh I‚Äôm not <em>that</em> likely to kill someone‚Äù</p>
<p>As for your incredibly out of context and stat, if what you just said was true there would be less than 20 deaths in the United States total... it‚Äôs almost as if you just picked the number you liked and ignored all the well published criticism of that stat and all the evidence that clearly it‚Äôs not telling the whole story.</p>

        <p>The reason I brought it up in the manner that I did is because it should be obvious that no one wants to share the road with a drunk driver. As far as the mask debate, until recently wearing a mask in public unless you were under going a specific task was foolish and in light of the COVID scare they are most definitely useless since the pores in these mask are huge since the virus is 10,000 times smaller than a grain of sand.                                        </p>
<p>Not to mention the so called leading expert Dr. Fauci said at the beginning when there was a mask shortage that wearing a mask might make you feel better but ultimately do nothing regarding protection. Obviously he reversed his position but that is a red flag in my book. It even says on the box itself that it will NOT protect you from catching COVID 19. By all means wear a mask if you'd like but forcing others to so is actually selfish. The statistics I gave are most definitely factual if you bother to verify them. Not to mention they have been counting anyone who dies WITH COVID as if they died OF the disease. This throws off the accuracy of the statistics. </p>
<p>As far as your last comment, deducting whether or not there would be less than 20 deaths in light of those statistics is quite frankly illogical since hundreds of people if not thousands die of varying causes each day due to the extremely large population of the United States which is over 300 million. Also, just because the establishment criticizes people who take a certain position doesn't mean it isn't true or those under going the criticism are incorrect.</p>

        <p>They are certainly not useless and their are actually useful studies and examples to verify this or do you think doctors and nurses where them to look cool?</p>
<p>Further, there was a shortage and the official stance was ‚Äúlet medical personal have them while we restock. not  ‚Äúthey are useless.‚Äù</p>
<p>And finally I was obviously talking about COVID deaths which far exceed 20 which is what they would be if the mortality rate was ‚Äú1 in 19.1‚Äù million.  And for the record there is good evidence to suggest the exact opposite of what you are saying about how mortality rates are counted is true. Plenty of people dying of COVID are not being counted due to ‚Äúpre existing conditions‚Äù and simply not being tested because they don‚Äôt test corpses. New York had some ten times it‚Äôs normal mortality rate during the outbreak and very little of that was attributed to covid because of how many were dead before they got the hospital. </p>
<p>You are being selfish and willfully ignorant. It‚Äôs obvious you will not have an honest discussion based on the fact that when I pointed if the chance of dying from it was actually ‚Äú1 in 19.1 million‚Äù then a nation of 300 million would have less than 15 total deaths obviously.</p>

        <p>I am aware of the shortage but there are numerous things that I have left out of the picture as you said. 1 tidbit of information I left out was a private  company named Blackrock (which is now in control of our Treasury but I digress) that invested heavily in mask mid 2019, almost as if they were anticipating their usage. Red flag. </p>
<p>When I mention the 1 and 19.1 million chance of dying of COVID I am speaking world wide, out of a population of 8 billion in which the stat still stands. Funny you mention the people with pre existing conditions which 40% of COVID deaths are attributed, which means the general population is NOT at risk which means the majority of people who are healthy SHOULD NOT be wearing them and thus makes them useless since the majority of people are not health care workers and thus do NOT need them. They actually do test those who die with pre existing conditions and Dr. Birx admitted so in a press conference in the spring. They test corpses all the time, ever heard of a toxicology test? They did one on George Floyd. </p>
<p>The studies you point to I am well aware of but the difference between you and I is I have a better understanding of the English language, my first point being you used the word "where" and not "wear" in the first sentence of your reply. Second point being when you read these studies there are words that most people gloss over that directly contradict the headlines which is usually all people read these days, words like "suggest" and "likely" "indicate" and "evidence". None of those mean anything concrete. "Evidence" is not "proof". "Suggest" isn't the same as "consistently repeated". All of those studies that I read that "suggest" mask work all end with the same line "while the evidence suggest they work, more study is needed." which means ultimately they don't know. The studies where they get above a 50% success rate usually involve hand washing and social distancing but not mask usage alone. I am not being willfully ignorant because I'm actually considering all sides of the equation not just the pro mask side unlike you. </p>
<p>I forgot who said it but "The sign of intelligence is being able to entertain a thought without believing it is true." The only reason I mentioned the US is because you mentioned it first, so my response was addressing the US's large population, but I am starting to think you might be mistakenly thinking 30 million to come up with that. Most people can't grasp how large the difference between 30 million and 300 million and understandably make the same mistake it APPEARS you're making numerically. </p>
<p>As far as New York's numbers being higher than the rest of the nation and people being dead before they arrive at the hospital, that could be attributed to neglect. Hospitals are admitting elderly patients that are being treated for starvation at an astronomical rate due to loved ones fear of infecting them with COVID. What could be considered a well intentioned measure of avoiding the elderly to prevent infection is resulting in a loss of humanity within the general population and is having a horrifyingly negative effect. </p>
<p>Back to the statistics, you also seem to be taking it literally like the fact that skydiving is safer than sex and whomever hears that stat and engages in that activity assumes they're invincible. That is NOT what I'm saying and the fact that you're taking it literally more so points to you not being able to have an honest discussion.</p>

<p>No it doesn‚Äôt you are completely and totally wrong about this. </p>
<p>8 billion divided by 19.1 million is 418. The death total is 778 thousand. So stop spouting a clearly worthless statistic. You literally didn‚Äôt even do the most basic math and before you say some serious nonsense 60% of 778 thousand is still a lot more than 418. </p>
<p>Full stop you are just wrong not even a little bit right. </p>
<p>Stop trying to condescend when you couldn‚Äôt even put 8,000,000,000 over 19,100,000 in a calculator to check if this was right. You just said it because you heard it on reddit and thought it was right. </p>
<p>And you know how I know you didn‚Äôt read the study it came from because the actual stat is in reference to the chance of dying from a single short interaction with an unmasked covid positive person. That‚Äôs what the study referred to not global deaths which are not mentioned once. </p>
<p>And for gods sake you don‚Äôt even understand the basic functionality of masks or what a a preexisting condition means or how it applies.</p>
<p>A mask is not for your protection. It is for the protection of others and they wear theirs in turn to protect you. So when you say ‚Äú the general populace doesn‚Äôt need it because they don‚Äôt have preexisting conditions‚Äù you misunderstand that the healthy aren‚Äôt protecting themselves they are protecting those that are at higher risk. Hence why you are being selfish, you get a bad cough, your immunocompromised neighbor goes on a  Vent and dies. </p>
<p>As for preexisting conditions, do you know how much of the United States is overweight? That‚Äôs a leads to a host of preexisting  conditions. If you took a random segment of the population you‚Äôd probably get something like 40% of them have preexisting conditions already. Further how is 60% being of fatalities being from an otherwise  healthy person an acceptable stat to you?</p>
<p>&rt;am starting to think you might be mistakenly thinking 30 million to come up with that. Most people can't grasp how large the difference between 30 million and 300 million and understandably make the same mistake it APPEARS you're making numerically.</p>
<p>300,000,000 divided by 19,100,000 is actually 15.7 something you can check yourself.  </p>
<p>You don‚Äôt understand the math. You don‚Äôt understand the statistics or how to use them. You don‚Äôt understand science(‚Äúfurther studies needed‚Äù is the scientific equivalent of crime in a cop show: ubiquitous). You don‚Äôt even understand your own source because you just suggested it referred to world wide deaths which A)it does not B) if it did it would totally and completely wrong by over three decimal points.</p>
<p>And as to your quote, I am plenty entertaining your thoughts. Hence why I actually sat and did the math, and looked the source of your claims, and have more critically engaged with your better points all while demonstrating that they are nonsense. I‚Äôve entertained them and shown them to be not true.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm turning off replies because it‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt want to be reached. You want to feel superior as you get kicked out of Wendy‚Äôs for not wearing your mask instead of admitting that you got taken for a sucker. </p>
<p>Please, have just the slightest empathy, engage just a little bit more in the possibility that you are wrong. You don‚Äôt have to admit it. You can call me a dummy or quote some very smart quotation and save face but please wear a mask, wash your hands, and social distance from those you are not living with. Don‚Äôt let your need to be right against every one as everything cost your cashier his life savings in medical debt or some stranger on the bus their life. </p>
<p>Just be a little smarter and kinder than you were here and you might have a better life.</p>

        <p>I am well aware of the reason people, including health practitioners wear mask but I have read numerous studies saying mask are effective and many that said they are not. You are referring to just ONE study that talks about brief encounters with the general population. I have read studies that date all they way back to the early 2000's where they followed surgeons who performed surgery wearing mask and not wearing mask and that study revealed a slight variance in post infection rates but surprisingly it was the surgeons who weren't wearing masks in which the patients actually healed faster and had lower post operative infection rates. It wasn't statistically significant to claim surgeons shouldn't wear mask at all but it was interesting none the less. After reading it I DID NOT TAKE IT LITERALLY MATHEMATICALLY. It was just one study that included a statistic. </p>
<p>As far as you claiming I might kill my neighbor by not wearing a mask, do you know how often I interact with my neighbors? Do you know whether or not I live in an enclosed apartment building or an apartment complex? A home in a large neighborhood or a rural area? These things are important to know in order to determine whether or not I am putting anyone at risk, yet here you are ASSUMING and not verifying which automatically tells me about your mindset and how you assess risk. Not very scientific. You are taking things literally and calculating the numbers and EXPECTING to see it as a direct reflection of reality which is a false equivalent. 1 and every 4 people supposedly have an STD yet if you were to test 4 virgins all would test negative, but by you using math in the manner you are is saying that even virgins will test positive for an STD because mathematically 1 and every 4 people have one statistically. That is what you are doing here. Statistics aren't literal it is a generalization but that doesn't mean the risk is nil. All I'm saying is the likely hood of you dying because you didn't wear a mask at work for 4 hours or 6 or 8 hours is extremely low and does not mean you will get infected or infect anyone else by doing so. Just because the majority of our population is obese does not mean they will DIE of Covid and my stats STILL reflect that, and no I did not get that stat from reddit which is another assumption by you despite you claiming to have a scientific mindset. 
Here's the official stats from the CDC AUGUST 10, 2020 :</p>
<p>TOTAL TEST: 65,756,307</p>
<p>NEGATIVE TEST: 59,867,907
NEGATIVE RATE: 91%</p>
<p>POSITIVE TEST: 5,888,400
POSITIVE RATE: 9%</p>
<p>TOTAL DEATHS 161,842
Death Rate (% of positive test) : 2.75%
Death Rate (% of Total Test): 0.25%</p>
<p>Population of US: 331,000,000
Mortality Rate: 0.04%</p>
<p>Chance of NOT Dying from Covid-19: 99.96%</p>
<p>These are officialdoms stats NOT mine. You have a problem with the math take it up with them. Oh, and here is a nice video of how things are going in the birthplace of the beer virus. Enjoy!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjDLFjmkNuQ&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>

        <p>You're a woman and I can tell. I give you CDC stats and you shut down. BTW I don't eat Wendy's or at the majority of fast food places. I don't call people out of their names in a debate like you did when you referred to me as "Batman" in a post much earlier. If you are pro mask what are you even doing here? I always assume the possibility that I'm wrong but in this case the CDC, despite recommending mask usage, have statistics that support my position and the very recent concert in Wuhan does so as well. My life is actually pretty good since I don't have a doom and gloom outlook like you do even though I am facing some very real and sobering challenges regarding my living situation.</p>

        <p>But how would that work? Air molecules (N2, O2, CO2, etc.) are drastically smaller than any viral particle, so if the mask is effective at preventing one from breathing in oxygen, it would be immensely effective at preventing one from breathing in viral particles. Conversely, if the mask is unable to keep out viral particles, it would be vastly less capable of keeping out oxygen. I tend toward the latter view.</p>

        <p>For the same reason we didn't attempt this buffoonery almost two years ago, when 48 million of us were sickened by the flu. As humans, we know there is no treatment for the flu, no real way of avoiding spread except isolation. That's what should have happened in March: folks who were high-risk and the elderly should have been isolated and the rest of us freed to go about our lives. But everyone panicked and the media fed into it. </p>
<p>And what do you think happens when "lockdowns" end? More people, more activity, more interaction leads to more spread. All they did was shifted spread forward a few months. And those little wisps of cloth that you worship won't save you from a virus.</p>
<p>If you don't want to catch this virus, STAY HOME. Stay locked in your home or apartment and don't leave it. You will have no social life, no job, no money, but you'll be alive, and that's all that matters, right? Why for the sake of having money, friends and activities are you willing to die, and to take others with you?</p>

<p>Are you concerned about infections or hospitalizations and death? </p>
<p>Most of the world did a month and is out again but for some reason America thinks you're special? </p>
<p>This is not true . </p>
<p>Why? The death rate in America is so disgusting.   </p>
<p>Please recall the overwhelming majority of deaths are elderly and and those with comorbidities . Perhaps this is a reflection on the poor health of people before this began ? Could it be they were already far down the road to passing on and the virus helped hasten it ? </p>
<p>This is why people get annoyed at subs like this and call them names it's not right but they're fed up with the self centred nature that gets shown when things like this happen </p>
<p>I‚Äôm not really sure how you conflate self centered with being skeptical and forward- thinking .<br>
The large majority of people against lockdowns are extremely concerned with the negative impacts on all facets of society caused by lockdowns . That would seem to be the exact opposite of being self centered .</p>

        <p>"Florida" is a state. Moreover, it's a collection of individual counties, which are made up of districts, boroughs, towns and cities. Many many many of those smaller divisions are not experiencing high infection rates, let alone filled hospitals and funeral homes.</p>
<p>Chill out, dude. If you knew anything about the US, you'd understand that it's essentially Western Europe. Do you say that Western Europe is doing a great job dealing with the pandemic because Germany's numbers are low? Or do you trash them because Sweden decided not to participate in the protocols?</p>

If folks don't want to live here, they're free to leave and find a place they like better.

<p>All the mandates were faith based. Social distancing isnt scientific and they themselves admit to it. It's an ideology,  an ideology used to close down private business and religious gatherings, which is 100% ILLEGAL. Our point is that the following the rules arent optional,  they are mandates. So by your logic, if cases ARE "out of control" it is in fact BECAUSE of the mandates actual effectiveness or lack there of, because there wasnt a choice in following them. Your whole "Because stupid America and stupid trump is why people hate masks and dying in america" is an off shoot of marxists meddling in our affairs. It simply is not factual</p>
<p>&rt;I've been doing things to limit my spread of this virus since way before my government told me to because like you I don't need to be told what to do.</p>
<p>Yet in same sentence you just admitted that government had to mandate it.  So isnt your country also problematic based your own assertions?  </p>
<p>&rt;I don't get how wearing a mask and staying inside is ruining your life? </p>
<p>Families and livelihoods dependent on 80,000 small businesses in NYC alone, negatively effected (financially) by lockdown. This is just a very narrow example that scratches the surface . Fauci himself said NYC was a role model in FOLLOWING the mandates yet our government is extending lockdown indefinitely based on arbitrary interpretation of data related to cases. So for our good pious behavior,  businesses are still folding. The post is about being SELFISH, not ruining lives. Did you even read it? Stop moving the goalpost</p>
<p>&rt;Catching and spreading the virus is ruining lives? </p>
<p>ICU and IFR, all time low</p>
<p>&rt;There's a reason America is so fucking behind on this shit and most of the rest of the world is getting over it. </p>
<p>This is yet another lie, see my previous comments. The cases are up, because testing is up. I cant make this anymore simpler for you. Rising cases (not danger as covid has lost it epidemic status) is NOW being used to lockdown, as opposed to PREVIOUSLY before, when lockdown was meant to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed,  which ALSO did not happen. </p>
<p>&rt;There's a reason America </p>
<p>You have yet to tell us the reason</p>
<p>&rt;rest of the world is getting over it.</p>
<p>Be more specific. Do you mean IFR, ICU, cases, recovery?  What regions? You are being extremely vague here. </p>
<p>&rt;is ruining lives? </p>
<p>Be more specific</p>
<p>&rt;Beavuse people followed procedure they didn't fight against it for the sake of fighting and saying you're right? </p>
<p>See my comment about New York </p>
<p>&rt;The changes are tempory if done correctly. </p>
<p>No. False. 100% false. In New York, mandates are were extended indefinitely. There is not one document you can show me where it says changes are temporary.  You are being dishonest here. What is the motive behind this argument if it is so false? </p>
<p>&rt;But fighting and making these issues political doesn't help and only causes more injury.</p>
<p>The issue is political.  Mandates are policies. Policy and political share the same root word. Dont be deceptive</p>

        <p>Our mask order in PA is also ‚Äúuntil further notice.‚Äù I don‚Äôt necessarily think the act of mask wearing is ‚Äúruining lives.‚Äù I think blanket, indefinite mandates by government is part of the problem. Again, my county has had 15 TOTAL cases in the last two days. Governors should not require masking but if Walmart wants to, then that‚Äôs Walmart‚Äôs decision. I also hate that we have been forced to treat everyone around us as sick. That‚Äôs a bit deranged. </p>
<p>Also I should not be forced to sacrifice income and my support systems that I get outside the home just because of some hysterical Hannahs on social media. Sitting inside all the time having nothing to look forward to and no positive life outlets available isn‚Äôt healthy either.</p>

        <p>Most times when a discussion is attempted it's met with refusal and ridicule. Regardless of the real concerns that are raised. Now <em>that is childish</em>.<br>
Read this sub, read other Lockdown Sceptic related ones. People aren't burying their heads in the sand out of some selfish want, they have legitimate concerns that you are ignoring.  </p>
<p>Freedom is important, the freedom of expression, the freedom to walk down the street, to wear what you want, to not be forced to do something, freedom to question, freedom to go against the status quo, it's a core tenant of a liberal society.<br>
But if you don't care about that then consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that lockdowns will have killed thousands of people who didn't have to die. <br>
Many cancer treatments and scans were cancelled in the UK because of lockdown. Meaning so many will have missed out on their chance to live full lives at the assumed expense of those who have already.</li>
<li>Children have been locked at home with abusers, as have spouses, for months on end.</li>
<li>Children have been forced out of school and forbidden from socialising with others.</li>
<li>The very people lockdown was supposed to save have died alone, not from COVID but from lack of human contact.</li>
<li>Dementia sufferers who depend upon seeing their loved ones have been denied contact. Hastening their declining health.</li>
<li>In the UK we were ordered not to see other households during the lockdown. Almost 30% of the population live alone, and were completely disregarded until relatively late in the lockdown where they were "graciously" permitted to visit one other household.</li>
<li>Governments around the world exercised insane levels of control over their citizens.<br>
In China people were rounded up into camps and welded into their apartments.<br>
In South Africa they banned the sale of Cigarettes and alcohol and had curfews imposed as an example.<br>
Business forced to close.<br>
Public transport closed.<br>
Borders shut.<br>
Mandated distances between people enforced.<br>
Fines for people sitting on park benches, or out in the sun on their own.<br>
Limited numbers of people allowed to congregate in public places AND private residences.</li>
</ul>
<p>We take this very seriously. We look at the data from the disease, we read statistics, plot graphs, make hypothesis and update them with new information. We also weigh up the costs of mandates put in place and their potential effect on the future.</p>

        <p>People have been wearing masks, and there's been a 99% or so compliance in both NJ and PA for months now, but our cases are still surging, it's "worse than ever", etc. It doesn't seem to be phasing our governors at all. They claim that people aren't wearing them, but every business is mandating face coverings, and won't allow people without them in (I've seen this for myself). I even see much more compliance with outdoors masks even before the July 1st mask order in PA. If masks were effective, this would have stalled the spread by a lot even if there were some people who didn't wear masks at all times.</p>

        <p>The guidelines are not universal in Europe. Yet many countries have similar curves.</p>
<p>In fact there were articles after articles showing people breaking the rules in the UK, VE Day street parties, beach trips, BLM protests, raves. All which ultimately had no perceivable effect on case count or death count.</p>
<p>Here in the UK no mandated masks were required in shops or outside and we are over the hill as it were.<br>
But as of Friday they will be required. This is not a policy backed by scientific necessity but rather a political policy to coax out those who are petrified to go to the shops.<br>
I have been shopping for months in stores and have seen the dwindling of face mask use (which was low to begin with as we were all advised against it for healthy individuals) and the gradual return to relative shopping normality only for it to be pushed back in an attempt to appease those who are needlessly afraid.</p>

<p>How so?  You've got places like New York where the pandemic is largely over and has been for nearly two months (only about a thousand deaths since June 1; less than 200 since July 1 in a state of almost 20 million) yet Cuomo is out there threatening to reverse re-opening plans.  How low do the numbers have to be for us to go back to normal?</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs been four months and we still can‚Äôt make our own decisions about how we want to live.</p>
<p>My county reported 12 new cases yesterday, and three the day before that. So 15 new cases in two days in a county of over 300,000. Yet we still can only have restaurants at 25% capacity, indoor gatherings with a 25-person limit, and tons of other rules. Our governor essentially punished us because Philly and Pittsburgh make up the bulk of new cases. I don‚Äôt live even near those cities. We‚Äôve been in ‚Äúgreen‚Äù for a month in my county now and cases have yet to explode. I feel we deserve more freedom than we currently have. Also, when I go shopping the vast vast majority of people have masks on. (Including myself because even though I disagree with mandates, I‚Äôm not gonna argue with a retail worker either.) What more are we supposed to do?</p>

        <p>Exactly.  And I think Philly is pretty much done with the pandemic too, though I've heard it's finally starting to hit Pittsburgh.  But the goalposts seem like they will be forever shifted.</p>
<p>It's like these governors see the curve of daily case growth and death count and see how it hit a peak and then trailed off to very low numbers and pat themselves on the back and say "this is because of our efforts!" without recognizing that this is exactly the kind of curve a virus follows.  Then they look at states in the South that <em>never</em> had a big first wave and say "see this is what happens when you re-open too soon!"  So they think if they ease up too much they'll have some huge spike in cases which is simply <em>not</em> going to happen.</p>
<p>Recent research from Dr. Sunetra Gupta in Oxford suggests the herd immunity threshold might only be between 20-30 percent because previous exposure to other coronaviruses conveys some immunity to covid-19.  If it's that low then that means the Northeast US has essentially reached herd immunity and the data seems to support this.  Either that, or people in the northeast are just <em>really fucking good</em> at social distancing üôÑ</p>

        <p>Here in Pittsburgh, county officials actually tried to get ahead of state restrictions when our numbers started climbing. (I'm hoping it was an effort to keep restrictions where they belonged, but in the end, it didn't.) Allegheny County restricted bars and restaurants from selling alcohol and all their sales had to be takeout. They banned indoor gatherings greater than 25, outdoor greater than 250. </p>
<p>The sad thing is that back in late May, it seemed that Allegheny County was going to avoid the wave. But the experts estimated that only 3% of county residents had been exposed to the virus, and when that was reported, I remember thinking that it wasn't good news for doomers. Sure enough, our positive tests started climbing -- but in younger, healthier folks. Great! Get this bug spread a bit more in this demographic, then the kids will spread it once school starts, and by cold-and-flu season, we'll have exposure and resistance built up a bit better. NOPE. The doomers clamped down. They warned us we'd have rising hospitalizations and deaths in the following weeks, but that hasn't really happened, since the ones who caught it didn't get that sick.</p>

<p>"The lockdown hostage proposal"</p>
<p>The lockdown was meant to flatten the curve, not be extended when MORE testing results in more positive cases. IFR and ICU is an all time low. You DO realise this right? We had enough of you foreign agents meddling in our affairs. Go back to Europe or whatever you came from.</p>
