        <p>Someone actually responded to me on /r/Toronto once telling me "he needs to be arrested because if he isn't then other restaurants will start doing the same thing".... Umm, yeah, that's kinda the point.</p>

        <p>One of my favorite comments was when they were posting about how small businesses and restaurants are being unfairly shut while big box stores stay open and someone just commented "uh, you guys wanted this". Exactly. You can't have your cake and eat it too.</p>

        <p>He was allowed to yes, but I don't think people realize that takeout and delivery alone is not enough to pay for the overheads with delivery apps taking such a huge cut and the provincial government offering dick all in terms of rent relief/assistance that they promised at the initial "2 weeks to flatten the curve" in March.</p>

        <p>I'm realizing the title gore is throwing people off. I was writing it chronologically but I guess that ends up being misleading without the correct punctuation. If I wrote it like this I think it would make more sense:</p>
<p>"Adamson BBQ restaurant in Toronto - whose owner defied lockdown orders and opened to indoor dining and was arrested and locked out of his business - is now allowed to reopen for takeout and delivery. 
He has also raised $333,000 on GoFundMe towards his legal defence and fines and to potentially take this case all the way to the Supreme Court."</p>
<p>What I meant was that I'm surprised they didn't condemn the restaurant or at the very least prevent him from opening again at all until the court case was decided. </p>
<p>Hope that clears it up. I tend to ramble.</p>

        <p>This guy is not “the little guy”, his employees that are now out of work are the little guys. </p>
<p>Adam skelly is a trust fund kid from a very wealthy, connected, and well known Toronto family. His restaurant was doing so well during lockdown with just takeout and delivery that he opened another location. His restaurant was far from struggling, his employees were able to remain employed, and he was able to give more out of work people work. </p>
<p>Then this jackass gets starved for attention and pills his shit and now his whole staff are out of work, but Adam gets to sleep well at night knowing daddy is taking care of him. </p>
<p>Fuck this guy.</p>

        <p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>He made a stand by opening indoor and outdoor dining.</p>
<p>Now he is right back where he started.</p>

        <p>I'm surprised you're against him, I read your comments a lot. </p>
<p>I don't think my post is misinformation, there's nothing I stated that is untrue: yes he opened for indoor dining to defy the lockdown mandates, yes he can now only do take out and delivery - as my title says.  </p>
<p>But this guy was shut down completely by the cops, locked out. I sincerely thought they were going to tear his place down at some point. The fact that he's now allowed to operate at all is huge.</p>
<p>Also, what he's doing for small businesses by having a legal defence fund and giving him a chance to take it before the supreme court is huge. The lawyers he can now afford to hire can make an excellent case that the banning of indoor dining was not in fact based on science as there is little evidence that restaurants are a major cause of spread. </p>
<p>In the long shot he does end up winning his case it could set a precedent for all restaurants and bars in the future if they ever try to restrict dining again. I guess I'm hopeful for how far this could actually go and things it could accomplish not just for him but for other businesses.</p>
<p>But you say you're against all this? Why is that?</p>

        <p>I guess I had better expectations. He made a stand, got fined, business license removed arrested and released. Now he gets a second chance to operate how he originally did before he tried indoor dining again. If he does this one more time he is done for. But I think we both know he won't. (although I hope I'm wrong) </p>
<p>I was hoping he would have become more of a martyr. </p>
<p>The police got away with all that bullshit and showed they can disperse a crowd, he made a pile of money and hopefully it motivated more businesses to start operating immediately.</p>
<p>And hopefully he uses the money and wins a whole bunch of lawsuits.</p>

        <p>Fair enough.... but he's all we got. He's like the Canadian Atilli's Gym guy and no one has made as big a splash as him. I also think he motivated a few others to stand up and do their own protests which is encouraging. </p>
<p>If you haven't seen this, it's an unbiased video of the events around his opening that don't paint him as the villain the media is making him out to be:</p>

        <p>Yeah this ain’t really a victory.</p>
<p>They fined him, arrested him, took his business license away. And now they’re “allowing him to do takeout only”...but he must obtain a business licence before reopening. Key word “allowed”</p>
<p>They beat him to submission to the point where he’s willing to accept what they decide to give him. He’s at their mercy. </p>
<p>In sports, this is what we call a moral victory. He took a stand, gave it his best shot. But still lost. And now is in a worse standing financially, yet he’s in the same position to begin with: only takeout / delivery, but with less of a chance to survive. </p>
<p>To some, it’s a feel good story. But in reality the government broke him. </p>
<p>It would have been a success if others joined him in taking a stand. That’s the only way to break this chain.</p>

        <p>I don't get the downvotes, you are right, he still cannot fully open.</p>
<p>He cannot even be open for outdoor dining - which I don't get, as that should be always much safer, unless it's overcrowded.</p>
