        <p>No worries. If you wanna check out more of his work:</p>
<p>https://www.corbettreport.com</p>
<p>He does good journalism, all fully referenced so you can check the sources yourself. I recommend having a look at the bill gates documentary if you haven’t already or at the “best of Corbett report section”.</p>

        <p>It’s not that advocates of cash like the actual material so much, it’s more that it offers freedom that centralised forms of digital payment do not.</p>
<p>On the other hand, depending on which country you are in, cash can be more plastic-like and less dirty. Although I’m sure it still has many people’s germs on it but that’s what we have our immune systems for.</p>

        <p>I don't get how people on here can come to these posts and say stuff like "Well, I support a cashless society, it's not that bad of an idea!". I've been seeing many comments like that lately, including support for masks and other security theater. Do people not understand that these are all aspects of the "New Normal" we are opposing?</p>

        <p>I mean if they had bothered to read the actual article, they’d know that it is in fact against a cashless society and argues against it. So whomever is downvoting my replies and this post clearly didn’t bother to read the damn article. It, in fact shows the world economic forum and the globalists push for a cashless society and says why it’s bad. It even compares it to authoritarian china. </p>
<p>Or like you said, you’re getting people coming to a freaking subreddit called, “no new normal” and are saying they actually support a new normal.</p>

<p>Yeah, this has been a thing. We get some regulars from LDS who seem to hate what this sub stands for, but still come here to vent over the lockdowns. The rationale seems to be that they are okay with the New Normal if it means no more lockdowns, and that the lockdowns are the ultimate evil here. And while I think the lockdowns are probably the worst thing to have happened in all this, the masks, distancings, security theater, and demands for changes to society are all a part of this as well. Of course, many of these people do not believe there is any correlation between any of these actions, and it is all a by-product of clueless politicians who keep bumbling and making "mistakes".</p>

        <p>There is a great double standard that people seem to employ when it comes to their own skepticism. They might not agree with the lockdowns personally so they’re skeptical of them but their skepticism ends there. It’s odd how people don’t apply that same skepticism to other things such as masks, social distancing, vaccines etc.</p>

        <p>Whenever I've asked why it's so farfetched to believe the government would want to pull something nefarious on its masses, I get the same typical responses: "That just seems like something out of a movie! It would never happen in real life!", "Because no politician worth their salt would risk their career or their life to pull something like this!", "It would entail for thousands of people to have to agree upon one goal to carry out something like this, and that simply would never happen realistically", "They would gain nothing from making this permanent so there's nothing in it for them", and so on and so forth.</p>

        <p>Yeah, and it’s always by people who have never bothered to look into the actual documentation behind anything. There’s countless declassified CIA and NSA documents showing so many false flag events over the many decades in regards to the Vietnam war or the gulf war or did we even forget Iraq? It’s like people forget these things so easily. I mean we could go on to show the huge scam of the 2009 swine flu pandemic and the whole influence that big Pharma had on the stockpiling of medicines and vaccines. They even had formal governmental inquiries into this and the British Medical Journal published reports too. 
It’s like there’s no need to speculate and be a crazy crackpot conspiracy theorists when all of this documentation is out there. It just needs some time to be found and researched because the MSM won’t bring it to you. It’s not in their interests. 
I know you know all this already but it’s just frustrating when people are so closed-minded about it.</p>

        <p>I just said I don’t use cash that often. No where did I say “I support a cashless society”l I just prefer to use my card or even my phone to pay for shit.  I’m fully aware people like using cash and that’s fine.  </p>
<p>You don’t have to be all on one side on subjects.   I’m a registered Democrat and i hate trump but I do hate these lockdowns and also hate how Democrats have reacted to this (amoung other things they’ve done )</p>
