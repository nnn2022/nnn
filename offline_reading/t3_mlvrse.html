    <strong>I do not understand the apathy towards the people who have died</strong>
    <p><p>500k people have died so far from the virus, which could have been a lot lower of a number. I disagree with government enforced regulations, but I believe the lockdowns didn’t work because the lack of public adherence. A lot of death could have been avoided if more people practiced safe public behavior, am I not wrong?</p>
<p>This is an open discussion and will gladly talk about this topic</p></p>

        <p>Lockdowns were never feasible for a number of reasons. One being that this is not the kind of virus that can be stopped. A high R0, low IFR virus is going to burn through the population quickly until herd immunity is reached. No silly lockdowns, whether it is one month or three months or one year can stop or slow it. No silly mandates can stop or slow it. Remember H1N1 and how everyone pretty much ignored it? Well it turns out that 1.5 billion people contracted it and there was never an accurate death count because the opposite happened to what is happening now...deaths were <em>undercounted</em> by quite a significant margin. </p>
<p>Another obvious reason lockdowns are quackery is the fact that you can't lockdown entire states and countries with millions of people in them...no economy can do it because it is extremely destructive. The West's lockdown flavor added yet another layer of absurdity to the shit show as to what businesses shutdown and why. How the hell is anyone more likely to get the virus at a restaurant or a clothing store rather than a supermarket? It's like small businesses and everything deemed "non-essential" on a silly whim were sacrificed at the alter to cure a virus. Unbelievable. </p>
<p>Also, the virus for those under 70, the mortality rate is extremely low. You don't see anywhere close to the same mortality across age groups. From very early on, it was well known that the virus heavily skewed towards the elderly. This is why most deaths have occured in nursing homes, where people have the combination of being elderly <em>and</em> affected by multiple severe conditions. </p>
<p>There are young/middle aged people who have died, but almost every single one of them had a <em>severe</em> pre-existing condition or been <em>severely</em> immunosupressed, these people could have just as easily died of the common flu in any given year. As for a the rare 20 or 30- something person with no severe condition that dies, it is an extremely rare and unfortunate cytokine storm reaction or being exposed to an unnaturally high viral load, but you have <em>hundreds</em> of cases like that <em>every year</em> from the common flu. In fact, covid has proven significantly <em>less deadly</em> to children and young people than the flu, and the vast majority of young people are asymptomatic. </p>
<p>Bottom line, this is a virus that is less deadly than the common flu for everyone except the elderly 70+, where the mortality rate is higher than common flu (note this does not mean it is a death sentence for the elderly by any means, as the vast majority of those 70+ will be fine, just means that the IFR for that age group is a little higher than the flu's IFR for same age group). Yet for some bizarre reason, the so-called "experts" chose to ignore those facts and crafted disastrous guidelines and policies that have no basis in logic...while the virus went unmitigated in the only places it needed to be mitigated...the nursing homes and hospices. And it was these same <em>experts</em> who were doing shitty math and showing bullshit models of overwhelmed hospitals in every city across the globe and tens of millions of deaths. Unbelievable.</p>

<p>I mean, there has been no community transmission recently in New Zealand and Australia after lockdowns. In fact a lot of the points you've raised have been disproven from these two countries undertaking those very lockdowns that "don't work"</p>

        <p>Are you actually unironically using island examples as your forefront proof that lockdowns work? Not to mention, some of these island "success stories" are still regularly locking down entire cities and abusing its citizens over a single case. </p>
<p>Are you able to name just 5 land countries that also "eliminated" covid? No? Didn't think so.</p>
<p>If lockdowns were truly a viable solution, we would have more than enough data from all around the world showing that they are effective, yet we don't because they are not (the same reason why they were never used before on such a large scale). </p>
<p>At this point it should be obvious that: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This is an extremely low IFR virus. Therefore, not even as nearly deadly virus as the media claims it is. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lockdowns, and all the other crap like test and trace don't work for viruses like this (excluding some of your beloved islands), they are simply to easily transmissible and mild, with an extremely high number of asymptomatics. This is why we never had such a stupid response to any other respiratory virus. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lockdowns and the rest of the dystopian crap wreak havoc and do irreparable damage to society, while being completely useless in stopping such a virus. The harm done is immense.</p>

<p>Now these countries aren't zero, but are near enough that life can resume as normal</p>

        <p>Not only are some of the countries you listed still having outbreaks, but one of the biggest determining factors in overall numbers is the rate of testing. So let's look at some of the testing rates for the countries you are using as your proof. </p>
<p>Vietnam -  14,684 tests per million </p>
<p>Taiwan -  6,541 tests per million </p>
<p>Laos -  14,078 tests per million </p>
<p>As you will notice, these countries are barely testing. The USA is at 942,635 tests per million. the UK is at 1,078,621 tests per million. Almost every advanced, 1st world nation is over 500,000 tests per million. Yet you are comparing the US to places like Taiwan which is at 6,541 tests per million. Even Vietnam is only at 14,684 tests per million. You don't see the problem in your logic? The more testing you perform, the more cases you will find and the more deaths will be ultimately attributed to covid. So your conclusion for the "success" for these countries is based on insufficient data. For every Asain country you pick with good numbers, there are 20 other countries with awful numbers, and they all have had lockdowns &amp; been wearing masks for over a year. There are so many holes and counter examples that no rational person should ever come to the conclusion that lockdowns work. yet here you are doubling down on this nonsense.</p>

        <p>Firstly, yes, there are still outbreaks in almost every country including Australian and New Zealand, that's why I said "these countries aren't zero, but are near enough that life can resume as normal "</p>
<p>And yes, the tests are higher in the US and the UK due to there being large amounts of cases. Here in Australia if COVID isn't active in a state, people by and large don't get tested.</p>
<p>&rt;You don't see the problem in your logic? The more testing you perform,  the more cases you will find and the more deaths will be ultimately  attributed to covid.</p>
<p>The classical mistake of correlation equals causation. Just because more tests are taken, does not mean there will be more cases. It's that more tests tend to be taken when case numbers are high. Yes there's a correlation, but there isn't a causation.</p>

        <p>Life is pretty much back to normal where I am, so much so that it has become rare to see a mask. People woke up :). But if you were to visit our local regional reddit sub you would think there were a massive Ebola outbreak that's just eliminated 90% of the population. Ergo; The local regional subs have by and large been overtaken by paid for shills and bots massively pushing the agenda.</p>

<p>&rt;Comparing weekly mortality in 24 European countries, the findings in this paper suggest that more severe lockdown policies have not been associated with lower mortality. In other words, the lockdowns have not worked as intended. Further tests also show that early interventions offered no additional benefits or effectiveness and even indicate that the lockdowns of the spring of 2020 were associated with significantly <em>more</em> deaths in the particular age group between 60 and 79 years.</p>

<p>The reality is that around 3 million people die in the US every year from all causes but you know what's funny?  We aren't hearing the corona death total being constantly announced like we did a few months ago before Democrats took over which is listed as even <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">higher</a> than 500k.</p>
<p>First of all, more <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm">people die annually</a> than that from cardiovascular ailments (heart disease) than the covid total which is now combining 2020 and 2021 for some reason.  Also, the death total in the US is almost certainly overcounted.  Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZocJGv_mAbo&amp;ab_channel=An0maly-NewsAnalysis%26Hip-hop">this video</a> or or just read about the liberal approach to tracking covid deaths on the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm#understanding-the-numbers">CDC page itself.</a></p>

        <p>Well, the stats I was going off were from 2018.  But yes, I'm sure it got worse in 2020 especially if you combine that with an increase in alcohol abuse.</p>

        <p>500,000 random people or 500,000 with a median age of death older than the median mortality age?</p>
<p>In my country, the median mortality age is 81. The average age of CV19-attributed deaths (that's anyone who dies within 28 days of a positive CV19 test) is 82. So quite literally, almost all the people who died would have died within the year anyway. </p>

        <p>Yes. The 500k number is complete bullshit. Didn't the CDC even start differentiating between dying because of covid and dying with covid? It's an important distinction.</p>

        <p>You are not wrong, but it is an open question, whether the concept of a lockdown actually works, unless you are willing to go the path China took at the beginning of the whole thing. However, I see other issues as well</p>
<ul>
<li>You simply need a certain number of people out and about to keep the lights on, people fed, toilets working and so on. So even if you keep everyone confined to their homes, except the absolute minimum of essential workers, you might still have more than enough people running around spreading the virus.</li>
<li>Personally I refuse to be lectured by people, i.e. politicians, who did and do nothing about people dying unnecessary for other reasons and now claim to care about each and every life, e.g. nobody wore masks in old folk homes during bad flu seasons in the past, thus causing thousands of premature deaths, or the chicken dance around pain killers (especially in the US), tobacco and alcohol, which all cause more deaths than COVID and those are advertised on TV.</li>
<li>All reactions to the crisis come with a (non-monetary) price tag, such as disruptions in child development for an entire generation, postponing medical treatments and diagnosis(!), deterioration of mental health and of course economic issues foreign and domestic. When the health officials warned about the possibility of a triage for COVID patients, they neglected to mention that all countries do a triage on a national level between COVID patients and all other sick people.</li>
<li>It was common knowledge that a pandemic would occur sooner or later and I demand better from the people in charge than shrugging their shoulders and "discovering" that all basic medical equipment comes from China and India or that the legal foundation for any reaction by governmental institutions is insufficient and bound to partisan decision makers. Not good enough! And since disaster preparedness is usually seen as an unnecessary cost, it wasn't any wonder that there weren't enough masks in the early months and that the hospitals, which work at peak capacity during regular flu seasons anyway, could not handle the additional load of incoming patients. And after a year we still do not know the drivers of infection? NOT GOOD ENOUGH! </li>
<li>Finally, the communication is abysmal. I appreciate that the scientists need time to gather knowledge and that the government is not omniscient, but for some reason the latter decided to deceive and lie at every corner and I don't care whether they do it for a good cause or out of stupidity. It does not help people when the officials promise to "open" every two weeks. It does not help people to be scared and to be told that they kill granny (and that was an open goal by several western governments). The talk of "control" and "stop" the virus is as dumb as it gets: if you need to lock up your population, you clearly lost all control. And there is no "stopping" most viruses, the flu is the best example for that and Corona viruses are a close second.</li>
