    <strong>Basic pathology for those who don't understand:</strong>
    <p><p>A virus is comparable to a parasite. Just like parasites, they need a host to reproduce and spread. Biology is based on survivalism. If a virus kills it's host too quickly, it is a bad virus as far as darwinism goes. </p>
<p>For a virus to succeed in its purpose of replication, being less lethal is ideal for transmission. If a virus becomes more contagious it will not become more virulent or dangerous. This is disadvantageous. </p>
<p>A good virus will spread quickly and infect as many people as possible. Killing the host is not benecifical as that prevents spread. </p>
<p>This virus can mutate to be more contagious, but the more lethal it becomes, the less contagious it will be. You can't have both unless you get into outlier situations like antibody dependent enhancement or vaccine enhanced disease, for example. Both of which, Covid-19 is succeptible to, and both have been seen with the mRNA vaccines. </p>
<p>Go exercise and live healthily. Was your hands and take a daily multivitamin. Expose yourself to other people and strengthen your immune system by being around other people with a different microflora than you have.</p></p>

        <p>Viruses not being a complete life form, I feel like the process is more random than a parasite surviving, which would give vaccines chance to eradicate the virus. Antibiotics don't do that afaik.</p>
<p>How are the other viruses surviving, especially the ones that we still take vaccines for? Would it be a big problem, if all the countries stop vaccination for those viruses, would it increase the death and if leave it for long enough without vaccine, will it definitely weaken?  </p>
<p>EDIT: fixed weird english.</p>

        <p>Traditional vaccines do prevent disease. Take smallpox for example- we eradicated it when we hit total herd immunity. That wasn't just due to vaccines, natural immunity is huge as it helps prevent variants. </p>
<p>Some things such as influenza are what we would consider endemic. They'll always be around and that's actually a GOOD thing. Your body needs viruses and bacteria for proper function, let alone immunity. They mutate over long periods of time and render previous vaccines ineffective. This is why HIV has no vaccine, but if mRNA vaccines work, HIV vaccines would work also. </p>
<p>The mRNA therapy isn't clear in any way so far as we have seen though. Gibraltar is a great example; they are a country with 99% Covid vaccinated people and yet have had a MASSIVE increase in covid infection which also has an increase in fatality, but I have yet to analyse the data to see if the percentage of deaths has increased comparatively. This could be attributed to vaccine enhanced disease, antibody dependent enhancement, or any other number of things. </p>
<p>Given previous data on vaccination and immunity of many 'common' viruses, how often do you hear of measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough, tetanus or teburculosis? Ive never come across a single case in first world countries. </p>
<p>If you gave everyone on earth doses of azythromyacin, we would see certain strains of bacteria emerging with resistance, as the non-resistant bacteria would be wiped out comparatively. This is similar to viral infection variants and resistance. Living or not, the one thing we see that viruses and parasites have in common is that they are opportunistic. </p>
<p>If a variant ignores the vaccine, and everyone is vaccinated, the variant spreads more extremely due to the opportunity. If people have a natural immunity, this is less likely as our innate immune system is created for developing the best defence for survival. </p>
<p>Vaccines only work due to your natural immune system. If your immune system is only taught to target a spike protein, anything with a different or variant protein will infect you. This is why I support traditional vaccines of non-attenuated viruses, as decades of science supports their effectiveness. </p>
<p>Whether or not mRNA works effectively against endemic viruses is something we will know in a couple of years but it looks like natural immunity is proving to be more resilient given the latest data from Israel on Corona viridae.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer. Is this thanks to the vaccines that first countries inject to kids? I actually sometimes might hear babies or very young kids getting measles.</p>

        <p>Immunity thresholds above 90% generally eliminate measles entirely in a community. Occasionally, vaccines do not provide complete immunity which I would assume to be the case. Sometimes a second dose is actually required but this is pretty infrequent. </p>
<p>Sometimes in a weakened immune system, disease can also occur. This is also pretty rare but it does happen. People with HIV can receive the measles vaccine and do so without incident very often. </p>
<p>People living in communities that have no outbreaks still travel to places where measles is common and this could potentially be why cases will emerge in countries where these diseases aren't seen. Young children who haven't developed an immunity could still catch it as you describe. </p>
<p>These diseases really are so multidimensional, it's important to not rush into any major decisions when treating them to ensure proper health for situations like this. One that comes to mind- Simian immuno virus (like HIV for monkeys) spread to humans in the 50s when polio vaccines were cultured in infected monkey kidney cells. That could have been prevented with better medical standards (while still eradicating polio), but I digress.</p>

        <p>Some good points.</p>
<p>Not to nit pick, there's a couple of additional points that people forget:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One has to consider how stable the virus is when replicating.  If there's a high probability of mutation, then you're trying to hit a moving target.  That's why a flu vaccine is needed every year and it doesn't always match the dominant strains.  I believe small pox and polio are more stable so less mutations occur.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural reservoir.  Coronavirus lives in bats and other animals.  That's why you see Ebola flair up from time to time - someone eats a bat or some other infected creature.  IIRC, small pox and polio do not have this problem either.</p>
</li>
