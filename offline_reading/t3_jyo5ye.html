    <strong>Germs don't spread in stadiums.</strong>
    <p><p>Let's say there's one person in a stadium with COVID-19. Because he/she is mostly sitting in one spot, only 8 people AT MOST will get infected. And it's not like those people will instantly get infected and start infecting other people. It takes a while for a pathogen to infect a body. Do people think one infected person being there means the whole stadium will get sick? People have seriously lost their intellects. But don't worry, it happens with every crisis. The germophobia should mostly wear off by the end of the decade.</p></p>

        <p>Yes but it’s not always while they are sitting. It gets quite crowded leaving stadiums and there it’s a high contamination rate, even with your only 8 people at most will get infected. I see you’re trying to say it’s a small chance but you and those 8 people aren’t the only ones at the stadium. Going by your rule it’s likely that there are other groups that have somebody infected. So we multiply that number. And we don’t have just one stadium either. So, multiple that number. Now add the leaving part I mentioned earlier with the crowds, also, it does take a bit for the virus to reach another person but games can take a very long time especially when they have to take fucktards like you out the stadium because you’re endangering others around you.  Sorry for bad grammar.</p>

        <p>Except that the 0.2% fatality rate of CoVid-19, most of those people over 75 years of age (my parents being an exception to the rule) says that people are in no more danger than they were in 2000-2018 from people not wearing masks.</p>
