    <strong>religious experience in a bathroom, 'rona edition</strong>
    <p><p>I HAD ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL INTERACTION WITH A HUMAN BEING IN A BATHROOM TODAY!</p>
<p>one of the things i've missed the most since March is going out for music and dancing with my husband or my girlfriends. i loved clubbing in Europe in the mid-2000s - peak sparkles and techno! i love being a drunk hot mess (when it's been previously scheduled and situationally appropriate, of course, lol). i am an extreme extrovert by nature, and i will literally make friends with anyone, anywhere, at any time. it might be my husband's pet peeve, because he thinks i'm a nut job. i like meeting people, and i like being nice to people, and i will never say no to someone just because it's the easy thing to do - i genuinely, sincerely like helping people and being nice. i love drunk girls in bathrooms because we're so sweet and friendly and nice to each other!</p>
<p>i don't think i've shared my unofficial religion with you fine people: the religion of drunk girls in bathrooms. you see, i believe that drunk girls in bathrooms are the purest expression of God's love. like, if Jesus were alive today, he would be a drunk girl in a bathroom. why, you ask? because we are so nice to each other! let's say you're out and about, you're hammered, you're sweaty, you're dancing your tits off, you're taking shots, grinding on anything that moves, and you have to have a wee and break the seal. you go to the bathroom. OH NO YOU HAVE TO BARF! but it's okay, because there is another drunk girl in the bathroom who will hold your hair back and help you get it together. do you need some toilet paper? ask a drunk girl! do you need a t-pon? we have t-pons! can someone get you some water? do you need a glass of wine? oh no honey it's okay, please don't cry over that boy, he's an asshole! he's not worth your time! (or girl, whatever works!) do you want to get some McDonald's? some Taco Bell? kebab? pizza? can we get you some water, maybe some aspirin? let me fix your eyeliner! here, try this lip gloss. can we get you a cab?! hey get outta the way, she needs a Lyft! you make the best of friends with other drunk girls in the bathroom. it's the purest expression of Christ's love. we will literally give someone our last tampon and fix her makeup AND get her a drink AND request her favorite song AND beat up that idiot boy! SHOTS FOR EVERYONE! drunk girls are the best because we treat everyone the way we would like to be treated - with kindness, love, respect, and dignity. with glitter and J√§gerbombs for all, amen.</p>
<p>today i went to the bathroom at work and another lady came in mid-wee (my building is enormous). a few moments later i heard the telltale, "GODDAMMIT, NOT TODAY!" and she asked me if i had a tampon. did i have a tampon? of course i did! so i went to the stall and slipped it under the door, and went to wash my hands. she came out UNMASKED a couple minutes later and thanked me (i was fixing my makeup) and i wasn't wearing a mask either! </p>
<p>we were just two ladies chatting it up, not even realizing we didn't have the mask on until it came up when i was talking about my eyelashes getting caught it in, and she was like "I CAN'T EVEN WEAR GLASSES ANYMORE, HELP!" and then we spent another ten minutes or so talking about how much we hate the masks and the "new normal" and how much is's messing up our kids and our families and tearing this country apart. and she said, "we are all sick and tired of it, and there's more of us than we know. we're just keeping our mouths shut until we decide it's over." i asked her when it'll be over, and she waited a moment, and said, "when the moms and the dads say so. time's up." SHE'S AN ANTI-MASKER TOO, ONE OF US! ONE OF US! </p>
<p>like me, she's been back in her office full time since May/June, and she said working from home just isn't for her, and it's not working for her office. distance learning isn't working for daughter, who is just five years old and becoming strange and withdrawn. her fianc√© hates telework and misses his friends. grandma doesn't want to stay home anymore. she said the coronavirus is here to stay like the cold and flu and strep throat. the mask doesn't stop them and it wont stop this - humans need to breathe!</p>
<p>"it's a virus," she said simply, "it's not going anywhere. we have to live with it, not the other way around. we tried to contain the virus and instead destroyed the middle class. it will either kill us, or it doesn't - plenty of other things out there will get us." she told me that her thirty-something y/o cousin died suddenly from a heart attack last month, and no one saw it coming! she said it's been devastating, but the family is honoring his last wishes for a real funeral, and no governor or president can stop them. i asked if she was sad and she said no, surprised, but not sad - none of us know when we'll die, might as well enjoy the ride. her grandmother is 93 y/o and won't accept another holiday along without her family and friends. she's more worried about the kids not getting vaccinated, being out of school, and going hungry.</p>
<p>i asked if this lovely lady was my NEW BEST FRIEND and she said YUP SAME! and we high fived! like, what are the chances that i meet my soul sister in the bathroom at work? what an amazing, beautiful human being!</p>
<p>we talked about Halloween - she and her fianc√© are taking their little girl to a pumpkin patch and then trick or treating. her daughter is going as a fall fairy (spoiler alert: it involves lots of sequins and sparkly leaves!). they're going to have fun even if the Karens and Kens try to cancel them. i told her we're going to drink out back and burn some masks on the grill and take it easy. i told her i'd like to see pictures of her adorable daughter and she was like, "duhhhhhh."</p>
<p>we exchanged phone numbers and emails, and we're going to get lunch in a couple of weeks. she's simply lovely!</p>
<p>proof that we can still make friends and meet people, and there are more of us out there than meets the eye. take a chance and talk to that person in the bathroom - they might make your day!</p></p>

        <p>Hey.  Just had a thought. Why not try to post this to TwoXchomesomes. It was really great to hear one woman‚Äôs view to this whole thing. Yeah it will most likely be taken down but it was so genuine and charming that it may just gain some traction and bring some relief to those who are struggling with the same feelings. Thanks for sharing this!</p>

        <p>thank you! i really wish that everyone who's struggling with the increasing social isolation and lack of interpersonal interaction had the same opportunities to make connections that i do. it's absolutely okay to feel joy when we have a nice moment and it's important to acknowledge that. just talking about it is huge!  ü¶ã</p>
<p>i don't post in other subs because i (a) generally don't try to stir the pot; (b) don't want to get this sub in trouble; and (c) i'm a coward who doesn't want to get cancelled. </p>
<p>i don't actually talk about my resistance in most of my real life, outside of my husband, my parents, and my coworkers. i've stopped to or communicating with some of my oldest and dearest friends altogether over this. all of my new normal activism is silent: i don't wear the mask until i absolutely have to, i don't go to stores where masking is enforced, and i generally avoid interacting with the public at large in an effort to avoid the restrictions. i'm afraid that i'll be shamed and cowed into submission, or that i could potentially lose my job or future job opportunities. so it's best for me personally to avoid the confrontation as best i can. </p>
<p>i don't even say stuff on Twitter that counters the narrative, really. i've become increasingly bold with my RTs and replies as this goes on, but i'm really not in-your-face about it yet. my followers knew me as a rabid anti-Trump libtard and i don't know what they'd think of me now.</p>

        <p>I was in anthropologie the other day and this woman complimented my coat and we had a 15 minute conversation. This sounds sad but it actually made my whole day lol. Most of my friends live farther away so the only people I really talk to irl are my parents and brothers. I really miss having girl chat. love this story üíõ</p>
