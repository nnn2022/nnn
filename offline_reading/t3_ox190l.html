    <strong>My understanding of what is happening.</strong>
    <p><p>Morning folks. Just wanted to write this down as a means of  solidifying my understanding of where we‚Äôre at and why what‚Äôs happened globally has happened.</p>
<p>Essentially this is all about the establishment of a new economic order globally; and it was necessary that it was carried out on the back of a ‚Äòpandemic.‚Äô As far as they are concerned this has to go through, come hell or high water. They are on a strict timeline - see Agenda 2030 (formally called Agenda 21).
The insanity and constant contradictions are necessary to befuddle folk, to break people down in order to accept their agenda. As in Orwell‚Äôs 1984. </p>
<p>The new economic system that they want to replace cash with - our current ‚Äòprice based‚Äô system, has to go in their eyes. Which isn‚Äôt surprising as the new system they are ushering in has its roots in technocracy - a system where resources (energy - oil, food, products, people) are the new currency. This explains the likes of Bill Gates now owning the majority of farmland in the US. The control of the resource that is food. Rockerfeller et al already own the oil. Cash has to go. </p>
<p>The new economic system will be controlled tightly by these technocrats. See the WEF ‚Äúeverything you need you will rent,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou will own nothing and be happy.‚Äù</p>
<p>In order for this system to work - it‚Äôs neo-feudalism essentially, there has to be tight controls of the populace. Because of course private ownership of resources is not acceptable to these folk. </p>
<p>Hope this makes sense. Please feel free to add, I just want to be clear on this stuff.</p></p>

        <p>Correct. It's easier to control the population  when there's less of us so that's where the vaccine comes in. I've also noticed the first and second world countries have vaccine access while the 3rd world is dealing with shortages. This is by design, it's more desirable to eliminate rich westerners leaving only 3rd world people and the ultra rich.</p>

        <p>I think you covered it, though you skipped past how the urge to get a needle in every arm isn't really about vaccines but about compliance and the 'passport' which will rapidly become:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Much more than just vaccine status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Universal, so more powerful than your national passport and required even to do anything in your own country, but controlled by the likes of Gates/WHO/WEF etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tied into cryptocurrency and 'UBI', as they want to replace prices and currency for your energy ration (hence the oft-debunked but still going 'CO2 warming' bullshit).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>
