    <strong>Evading Quarantines</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everybody, been lurking the sub for quite a bit and I’m in need of some advice. I haven’t seen my family since this BS started and all the travel restrictions became a thing, and after a very lonely year of forced isolation I’ve decided I’m just gonna say “fuck it” and go visit them this month - life is short. However I’m going to be traveling by plane and I was wondering if anybody here has done so and if there’s any off chance somebody can give me advice on how to evade quarantine / testing rules? Are these restrictions even something that are necessarily enforced? I’m planning on going to Massachusetts if it helps.</p></p>

        <p>Not sure how you can get around testing, but if they want contact information for quarantine, give them a fake name and address. They don't have the manpower to check up on everybody.</p>

        <p>That depends if they demand the information after you've landed and it's a different person taking the info down. If you really wanted, you'd have a fake ID ready to go for this purpose. Combine this with the intelligence of your average TSA officer and you can get away scot free if you play your cards right.</p>

        <p>I have traveled all over the US this whole time, mainly for work. Granted, the last time I flew was in mid-November, LAX-MIA-LAX, so things could have changed since then. But I haven’t once come across anything barring me from traveling domestically. I haven’t had to show proof of a negative test or forced to get tested upon arrival. Not even temperature checks anywhere. Flying seems completely the same to me, minus the masks (btw I spent most of my flight from MIA-LAX with mine off and no one said anything) and that most of the stores and restaurants at the airport are shuttered. </p>
<p>I have one friend who said he was threatened with a $500 fine if he did not consent to be contact traced upon arrival at LAX in December, but as said here, you can simply give them false info, as you should! </p>
<p>As far as I can tell, quarantining, if you are traveling within the US, is totally voluntary, but worded to sound like a LAW. No one is going to be following you to make sure you don’t go anywhere for two weeks, how could they? </p>
<p>So yeah, you should absolutely say fuck it and go see the people you love. Life is short man!</p>

        <p>I wish I knew.</p>
<p>I have to get a Covid test done soon in order to get a medical procedure done, and there doesn't seem to be a way around it unless I cancel it...which would be foolish. Though if I test positive, they will still cancel it, and I'd have to isolate for two weeks. They will probably send a contact tracer to my home as well. Ugh.</p>
