    <strong>Aren't the vaccinated willingly becoming asmyptomatic?</strong>
    <p><p>They can still get covid and most importantly - SPREAD IT. Remember when this all started and they used the asymptomatic line to scare people into wearing a mask? They, in a sense - made it seem like those without symptoms are even more selfish because they're killing people without even knowing it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lets think about it like this - If I get the vaccine to lessen my symptoms and can still spread it, you're basically becoming asymptomatic. Yet you'll still walk around in public and spread it to others.  </p>
<p>If the response was "Well, you still feel the symptoms of the virus, they're just not as bad!" - kind of makes it seems like there is no real point in getting it at all.  </p>
<p>This is all over the place I know. I'm just trying to say that by getting the vaccine you are willingly becoming asymptomatic and spreading the virus. The exact same thing you crucified people for doing in the past (Who probably weren't even sick).</p></p>

        <p>True, it was true in science pre-2020, only changed for the $cience to drive the panic, &amp; now the news $cience is magic- if you are vaxxed asymptomatic, you 'are not a driver of disease, but if you are not, then "you are killing people". </p>

        <p>This is exactly what I've been wondering since they started saying you only have to wear the mask if you're unvaccinated. Assuming the asymptomatic transmission is real, then the vaccinated people are the ones spreading it more while out and about, because they're more likely to have it without knowing it. Makes no sense at all.</p>

        <p>Yes and isn't it then more logical that when you are carrying the virus and the vaccine it will mutate?? Seems much more possible to me!
 Got no proof of this but neither do they when  they blame the varriants  on the people who didn't get the shot!</p>

        <p>Yes, so instead of quarantining the sick individuals to avoid spreading the virus, we have people spreading it without even knowing it. </p>
<p>They've been clamoring about asymptomatic spread for the entirety of the "pandemic," but it seems that was just preparation for the leaky vaccines.</p>

        <p>No, because Covid is not spread asymptomatically.  The studies came in last month(?) that there has not been one. single. case. of reported asymptomatic spread in the world.  This includes in jurisdictions with sophisticated contact tracing protocols.  </p>
<p>Covid CAN be spread presymptomatically, which looks like asymptomatically until the person starts coughing.</p>

        <p>I am interested in your point because I followed science back in November 2020 that in millions of cases, asymptomatic people could not get others ill, whatsoever, as well as acute flu infections unable to infect others, even with the scientifically controlled attempt to do so. Can you provide citation for differences between pre- and a- please?</p>

        <p>The injection doesn't appear to reduce severe symptoms in most age groups. It does appear to reduce mild symptoms while also having large viral loads.</p>
<p>As usual, the uninjected are being accused of being plaguerats but uninjected infected people do not asymptomatically spread because their viral loads are so low they don't have symptoms while it's actually the injected who are being turned into plaguerats as they can have no or very mild symptoms while having high viral loads.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1418297812714917888">There was a recent observational paper on viral loads put out recently</a>. A group of injected people and uninjected people who tested positive. The injected people had as much as <strong>twenty times</strong> the viral load as the uninjected without experiencing mild symptoms.</p>

        <p>Ya it's kinda ironic either the vaccines actually work and reduce your symptoms buttt your still spreading it so now you'll spread it even more without knowing it. Or it does work and then you might actually end up forcing the virus to mutate in order to get past the vaccine either way your just making it worse.</p>

        <p>But if the unvaxxed don't want to get it the only people it's hurting is them.... It's a conscious choice. Anyone who wants it can get it and those who do feel less symptoms. What's the issue?   </p>
<p>Also, it doesn't stop the spread because you still transmit it when vaccinated. Wtf... am I going crazy with these responses!?</p>
