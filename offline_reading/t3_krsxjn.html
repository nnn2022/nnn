    <strong>Covid Ruined my Friendship (Advice Needed!!)</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know where else to post this without getting downvoted, but I'm hoping there are some reasonable people on this sub who can offer me multiple perspectives. I'll keep it as brief as possible.</p>
<p>I'm in the military, stationed far away from family and friends back in NY. I rarely come home, but I managed to for the holidays plus my birthday was Jan 5. I planned a get together on Dec. 26 to see everyone (all of who are healthy and in their mid 20s) who I hadn't seen in months (years for some) and it was a bust. Many people canceled, but I still had it anyway. One of my friends who cancelled is someone I'd consider a true best friend, the kind who checks on you every now and then to say "hey how are you feeling" and makes you feel noticed. Let's call him Tom. </p>
<p>I love Tom especially because he is such a good friend and although a democrat, he respects my conservative views and is willing to listen. He knows how I feel about the pandemic, hell he knows I had covid and survived and it was nothing more than a small cold. He went out in the summertime to parties and public places. However, his gf's mother got covid the week before xmas so he's been isolating since. Ok, no problem so I created a new event on my actual birthday, Jan 5 knowing his 14+ days would be up. He tells me that he still can't come because his parents don't want him leaving their house, because of his gf's mother, covid rates are up, and his brother is getting a surgery in the next month. I sort of got into a disagreement with him saying I may not be back for months or years especially since he's been isolating and he's a grown ass man. </p>
<p>If you've made it this far, thank you. What do I do?</p>
<p>LR;DR: My best friend (25M) wouldn't see me on two separate occasions because of covid concerns but I'm (24F)  military and cannot guarantee when I'll be back. He was all huzzah about seeing me until his parents/other friends/media fear mongered him. What do I do?</p></p>

        <p>Wait it out?  Be willing to put things aside with him for now?  Hard.</p>
<p>My dad lives with only my mom and they're bubbled yet still won't leave the house without a face shield, masks and gloves and wipes down cart handles and door knobs.  When I told him about the bill in New York allowing them to detain people he thought it was a good idea.</p>
<p>I can't really talk with my dad too much about these things because I'll probably fight him when I see him.  Way she goes right now, bud.  Fuckin way she goes.</p>

        <p>Can you clarify what you mean by put things aside with him for now? It's not just for me about right vs wrong or the like of politics. It's about a best friend who won't see me when I'm barely around. I feel given his past actions of going out and being OK with seeing me until others influenced him is fueling the hurt. It's illogical and it kinda makes me think if I got hit by a bus tomorrow that doesn't matter because he was safe isolating himself from covid.</p>

        <p>I mean you might have to put a hiatus on the friendship even if it's longterm due to your military career.  I mean what are you gonna do, right?  I wouldn't take it personally because he is succumbing to the fear, it's not to do with you.</p>

        <p>Ya I agree. Maybe send him a letter explaining how you feel and that you are willing to put aside temporary differences in opinion because of how much you value the relationship. This is a very contentious topic after all.</p>

        <p>Well at the end of the day it <em>is</em> just a difference in opinion, even though you both may feel extremely strongly about it. </p>
<p>I have had the same disagreement with my parents and siblings. But I‚Äôm not willing to let this one (major) conflict ruin my relationship with them. Both parties need to agree to disagree. That‚Äôs the only resolution, if neither of you backs down. </p>

        <p>theres the urge to escalate or prove a point, but the person saying wait it out is spot on.  as you know from hanging out here, the fearmongering and downright brainwashing has been INTENSE on an existential level.  hang in there, but maybe let them go for a while but dont damage all he good thats built up and likely to return after this stupid media/political spell has worn off.  feel your pain OP, so many of my friends seem mentally weak and intellectually uncurious these days to a sickening degree.  hang in there üëäüèº‚ú®</p>

        <p>Thank you. That is my goal. Due to travel and doctor appointments/business, I legitimately am busy until the weekend at least so that is true regardless of my feelings on the matter. This gives me time to think. The only thing I've come to the conclusion so far is to step away from the matter until I can wisely talk about it instead of being emotional and angry. I'm not sure if the weekend is enough. But I guess I should look at it as I at least didn't escalate it.</p>

        <p>I think it's important to remember that unless you are a very strong personality, the guilt, emotional blackmail and fear will likely get to you at some point. Most people are, sadly, not that strong. The people I've noticed who have managed to ignore it, are those who had an abusive parent (in some way or another). They understand that authority lies and does things for personal gain. That you cannot trust those here to 'protect you'. Once you understand that, you never really change back.</p>

        <p>On the opposite side of the spectrum from you and wound up here accidentally, but wanted to point out one thing that you might have overlooked. </p>
<p>If his brother's getting surgery in the next month, even being exposed to COVID could seriously mess that up for him. I had surgery last February and got out of the hospital by the skin of my teeth two weeks before COVID hit. My doctor told me that if I'd been exposed to it, he wouldn't have operated, and this was a situation where there was surgical hardware coming loose from my skull and pushing out of my scalp. And my doctor is not a paranoid delicate flower. Anesthesia really fucks with your system, not to mention your immune system needing to be in good shape. </p>
<p>How you deal with it? I don't know. But it's not a case of irrational fear-mongering for his own sake; he could get it and be fine, but his brother's surgery would probably be delayed.</p>

        <p>True, but this was never mentioned until last minute for the SECOND planned get together. In other words, he could have made the first one and still quarantined in time for his brother's surgery.</p>
