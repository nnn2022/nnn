        <p>&rt; But the CDC warns that workers could be threatened or assaulted for employing these safety measures, describing violence ranging from yelling and swearing to slapping and choking the employees. The CDC has outlined a number of steps businesses can take, which include conflict-resolution training for their workers, installing security systems and identifying designated safe areas in stores employees can go to if they feel in danger.</p>
<p>Yet I see people here act like we should trust the CDC because every so often they say something vaguely "anti-lockdown/New Normal". </p>
<p>(and before people jump in defend them in this instance, they seem to imply people who don't wear masks are inclined to get violent with workers, even creating these guidelines for violent anti-maskers. The CDC is not our ally...)</p>

        <p>I just don’t go into businesses that enforce masks. Except I went to the liquor store yesterday.  The state owns all liquor stores in Pennsylvania so there are no options.  The clerk says sir you have to wear a mask. I said no thanks. “Sir I can’t serve you if you aren’t wearing a mask”. As I’m walking to the whiskey shelves to get my whiskey I say “ok” and put the mask on my head.  “Sir it has to be covering your nose and mouth.”  By this time I’m at the register and the clerk just rings my stuff up.</p>

<p>I've not been to a single business in PA that has allowed people in without masks. Not a single one, whether a small business or a chain. People tend to get immediately kicked out, and those who don't leave, tend to get the cops called on them.</p>

        <p>I have been inside numerous businesses and only 1 refused me entrance.  Harbor Freight.  The guy says “you can’t come in without a mask.”   I didn’t argue.  I said “ok fuck it, I’ll go somewhere else.” And I went to another store without a mask.  As I said the liquor store tried to refuse me entrance but fuck then.  There are no other choices and my taxes over pay their employees so I’m going in either way. But besides those 2, I have not had a single business say anything about masks.  They have signs up that say masks are required but I just ignore them.</p>

        <p>Only CVS refused entrance to me and I put it on because I needed my prescription. I did however save the rest of my shopping list for another store.</p>
<p>The article mentioned CVS policy has changed to stop refusing service, so I'll try on Friday when I pick up next Rx.</p>

        <p>I get my prescriptions delivered from an independent pharmacy so I don’t have to deal with the lines at my local CVS. Co-pays are the same and the delivery is free. There are a lot of pharmacies that offer this service.</p>
