        <p>&rt;Representative Marjorie Greene (R-GA) has just introduced the "We Will Not Comply Act," which, if passed, would ban all mandatory vaccines at the federal level. The Epoch Times reports that the bill would also bar airplane companies from requiring vaccines to travel in addition to make it illegal for a Coronavirus vaccine to be necessary for a U.S. Passport.
&rt;The Epoch Times reports:</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;The We Will Not Comply Act would ban documents that show who has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for the CCP virus. The concept of requiring certification has been rejected by pro-privacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
Greene’s measure likely won’t be taken up by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, and if it is, it will be unlikely to pass. It would “prevent any business engaged in interstate commerce from discriminating against a person based on their COVID-19 vaccine status,” cut off federal funding for a vaccine mandate on employees, a vaccine mandate for students attending schools, and mandates on organizations or sport—or “any person who expresses religious objection,” according to a statement from her office.
It would also prohibit the government from requiring a CCP virus vaccine to get a U.S. passport and “prevent Airline companies from denying someone from flying based on their COVID-19 vaccination status,” as well as “create the ability to sue if a person has been discriminated against on the basis of their vaccination status or mask compliance,” her office wrote.</p>
<p>&rt;This comes as Republican Congressman Doug LaMalfa (CA) introduces legislation to ban vaccine passports, citing the ban comes down to protecting privacy and individual liberty. The law comes as the Biden administration has openly flaunted they are working to bring about vaccine passports.</p>
