    <strong>LA fam and non-LA fam alike... money talks</strong>
    <p><p>I live in LA and let me tell you, it has been eye-opening on many levels. Homeless people have told me and my wife to go back to our own country for speaking Spanish (The irony is ripe for so many reasons but mainly because I’m white/Native American and learned Spanish because of my wife), I’ve had homeless people throw glass bottles at us, with one breaking and getting my face, I’ve seen homeless people defecate in a Starbucks planter, my office building (which I should clarify is definitely not a cheap building to rent) has been literally set on fire by homeless people, vomited on, and more. You always have to watch where you’re stepping at the beach in case of needles. And all of this is allowed...</p>
<p>BUT!</p>
<p>There are still restaurants making people wear masks inside. LA people, avoid going to Joan’s on Third, in particular. These people have absolutely lost the plot. We were meeting some family for brunch and they required us to wear masks while we stood in line and ordered. The manager or owner got mad at me because I said I didn’t have one, delegating his employee to grab me one. When I asked why they’re requiring them when the state gov and CDC recommend otherwise, they couldn’t even give me an answer so I grabbed my wife’s hand and just walked out. We met with our family at a place down the street that was delicious, had a prettier patio, and insanely good customer service (and no masks!).</p>
<p>Anyway, what I want to say here is that it doesn’t matter much what we say amongst ourselves if we don’t vote with what matters most: our wallets.</p>
<p>Love you guys! Have a good weekend and enjoy some fresh air!</p></p>

        <p>Honestly I’m salty because in my town you can’t get a job unless you can speak Spanish. And honestly I thought this was an English speaking country. Not racism but true facts.</p>
