    <strong>So you've figured it out, how do you maximally benefit from that?</strong>
    <p><p>Aside from the obvious healthcare decisions, of course.</p>
<p>This community clearly knows things that the general public does not know, or refuses to acknowledge; things that will be very consequential and for which will clearly be a huge surprise to almost everyone.  </p>
<p>That would seem to leave a lot of room for smart money to make plays that will eventually seem prophetic, and help guarantee security and autonomy in the future.  "I told you so" isn't worth squat.</p>
<p>Shorting pharma stock seems too obvious, and they're protected from liability, anyway.  I know there are prediction markets like Predictit that let you bet on real-world outcomes, but I don't see anything particularly relevant there.  A Viager is too specific to an individual.</p>
<p>I can't be the only one thinking this, so how are you all "putting your money where your mouth is" to leverage this?</p></p>

        <p>i dont think there will be sudden cliff in population, the sterilization scenario is more likely.. life will go as usual, the demographics will start to show maybe 15+ years from now, besides that, people will live, will-broken, without kids more nihilistically, hedonistically - unless there's this plan for clima scare, live modestly, eat bugs.. green technologies will rise, they will be forced on people, similarly as vaccines are now, after elites prophetically invested in those.. hard to predict anything, so many assumptions, no bet is safe, i would just follow the elites in investments - agriculture and green tech</p>

        <p>They "need" funerals and burial plots, at least until there are too many, and they leave behind estates which pay off debts, sell their 401ks, and get consolidated.  The ripple effects have to be huge, and it seems foolish for those who see those effects coming not to position themselves to benefit.</p>
<p>The absolute darkest timeline is hardly worth considering, as everyone like us is guaranteed to lose, whatever we do.  But looking back on any of history's great upheavals there are people who saw the writing on the wall and got in, or got out, early.</p>
<p>I mean, who's really making the decisions, and what are <em>they</em> investing in / divesting from?</p>
