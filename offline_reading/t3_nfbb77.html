        <p>lol that wasn't my question but I do agree, a lot are.</p>
<p>I just want to give a heads up, probably already known to most of you but mods are on a real power trip and a lot of them flat up do not like people posting here. Too much truth hurts their brains I think.</p>
<p>I was banned for simply responding to post in R/Toronto (a post that was upvoted 5 times) are the freedom parades with thousands of people super spreading events? People acted like I had 2 heads. How dare I question that?</p>
<p>We have been in lockdown for almost 8 months now. I can't have 5 people over to my house legally and can't hang out with 10 people outdoors, can't play a round of golf on a big course with 3 others but thousands of mostly unvaccinated, unmasked people cab March together? Am I in another world? </p>
<p>My crime for questioning the new world order. The king-mod declares I am brigading and must be permanently banned. And than they mute me so I can't reply. Cowards!</p>
<p>My second crime was to offer support to a girl who may have been having a severe adverse reaction to the vaccine. On r/covidsupport I shared a story about my FIL getting vaccinated and ending up in the hospital for 4 days. He was weak, warm, I had to pick him up to get up.</p>
<p>The mod didn't believe me and said I had an anti vaccine agenda. Of course I must have one, I choose to get vaccinated but I post here and r/conspiracy so I must be evil. Banned and reported.</p>
<p>Tried complaining to reddit, I got told they let mods handle their own subs.</p>
<p>Be careful what you post, some reddit mods are going through your history. Insane clown world.</p>

        <p>The Toronto mods seem probably particularly miserable and they are prob antisocial weirdos who stay home and never leave their basement. This little power of being a mod is like sex for them (not the good mods, there are lots, the ones who can't control a forum. It's a complete echo chamber.</p>
<p>I literally said nothing to be kicked out for brigading. I gave them the literally definition of brigading and asked would he answer me how was I brigading.</p>
<p>The coward said he would, then said because he read my messages complaining about it banned me from contacting the mods for 30 days.</p>
<p>Reddit is burning its site and free speech down when you can't ask why I can't go play golf, eat at an outdoor restaurant, why we can't go out with ten people or have more than 5 people at our house but thousands of people, mostly unvaccinated and unmasked can go outside with a police escort.</p>
<p>We have been in this weird lockdown for 8 months, been told a few weeks ago hospitals were at its breaking point. Now kids still have to stay home for school, we are not supposed to go out, many businesses are dying, mental health issues are skyrocketing. </p>
<p>But if you ask why are the numbers going down when this is going on you get banned for questioning is this a super spreader events like they use to call it when Trump had a hundred people outdoors.</p>

        <p>Most people on the mainstream subs seem to be miserable people who stay at home all the time, yeah. </p>
<p>I think you should be able to play golf, play tennis, have a protest, do whatever outdoors. Ironically, there would be fewer people at the protests if outdoor recreation like golf was open.</p>

        <p>Will do, and thanks for the offer, although I live fairly far from Toronto. I did go to Toronto Island once for a paddling competition though and I thought it was nice. The only thing I didn't enjoy is that there seemed to be a bunch of goose poop on the ground, a lot more than in other places.</p>

        <p>Some subreddit sadly are like that.
There are many examples from /covidvaccinated having a script to ban people automatically who are active in specific subreddit to /conservative who only let specific people comment under most posts to /nonewnormal who delete some comments. </p>
<p>Reddit is just not that much about free speech as it should be. Thats is not censorship since its not government controlled.
But still its horrible.</p>

        <p>Just like so many things, you hear about it happening to others but it doesn’t have the same impact until you experience it yourself.</p>
<p>Though I can’t say I’m anti-vaccine - I’m not. The current push is to promote an experimental injection. It’s not a vaccine since it doesn’t make you immune.</p>

        <p>I would say I am pro vaccine for tried and tested vaccines that have eradicated polio, measles etc. I dont think they should be forced on people still.</p>
<p>This vaccine is different as it has not been around for years, was rolled out in a year. </p>
<p>I have been on reddit for a couple of years with different accounts and i knew censorship and bamming has happened but it's only the last while I noticed they would ban you for nothing at all. </p>
<p>I've honestly never been banned except for maybe once or twice on an alt where I deserved it to a degree. </p>
<p>Now you even ask a question about protest or vaccine you get banned right away. Or mods going through my post, never experienced that before.</p>
