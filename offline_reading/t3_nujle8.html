    <strong>When we're talking about the vaccines causing potential harm, does it apply to all or is it mostly about the mRNA vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>I definitely don't trust the vaccine rollout either and will personally wait and see if anything wrong happens, but something i usually don't see is any elaboration on which particular type of vaccines most people are concerned about, because Johnson&amp;Johnson's type is different from the other two (moderna/Pfizer)</p>
<p>so when most people are here are concerned about it, is it mostly directed at the mRNA vaccines or is it for all of them, including johnson's, which is non-mRNA and somewhat more trustworthy since its still the somewhat traditional one?</p>
<p>EDIT: Add AstraZeneca to that list too, sorry i forgot</p></p>

        <p>I'm not worried about any of them - because I'm not going to take any jab!</p>
<p>I've looked at the studies, I'm not convinced any of them are safe,</p>
<p>I've looked at the numbers, I'm not convinced any of them are effective.</p>
<p>I've looked at the government and health authorities, I think they're compromised.</p>
<p>I look at the plans for vaccine passports - I'm horrified.</p>
<p>By not taking any jab, I help prevent vaccine passports.</p>

        <p>For me it's all three (four if you include Astrazeneca). Sure J&amp;J isn't mRNA but it's still caused blood clots. Overall, all these vaccines were rushed to market with no long-term clinical testing data to see what the potential long-term, even mid-term side effects could be. The mRNAs are just more concerning because it's a new technology</p>

        <p>I think you've misunderstood how these "vaccines" work. They inject code into your cells via lipid nanoparticles or viral vector to have your own cells start producing the spike protein from the virus. So your own cells start pumping out billions of damaging spike proteins, using genetic code copied from the real virus. Your body might now recognize those spike proteins as bad, but the spike proteins themselves are damaging. Also, despite their original claim that the spike proteins would stay attached to the cell surface, they are in fact breaking free and circulating through the body.</p>

        <p>J and j and astrazeneca still aren’t traditional.  The vector is more like those used in the past but otherwise also new unproven technology - And some consider it worse because it goes into the nucleus of the cell...  Astazeneca is proving to be the biggest nightmare in the short term at least</p>

        <p>Goes into the covid jab (mRNA) as well and shows the links between the that antivax movement and how it’s affecting the current anti-covid-vax movement. I got the vax so I could get back to work and take off the mask. Not trying to let my quarantine disdain push me towards antivax tbh. Personally, I sought out the Pfizer over the Johnson+Johnson because of efficacy and avoiding unwarranted side effects (my blood clots extremely fast, and j+j isn’t good for that.) gene therapy is a scary word, gmo food is gene therapy technically lol.</p>

        <p>The thing is, before and independent of Andrew Wakefield, many of us parents were seeing vaccine effects on our kids. I personally knew someone whose baby was developing normally until right after a vaccine appointment, when he then regressed and lost skills he’d already had, ending up diagnosed with autism. My own baby had a less severe, but still disturbing reaction after a vaccine. Another of my kids is autistic, but not from vaccines. When a relative learned of his autism, his response was a sympathetic, knowing “oh…from vaccines?” When my response was no, that he hadn’t been vaccinated, my relative turned instantly hostile, demanding “why?!” WTF. 
I’m not anti-vaccine, but I think people should always be able to make their own, informed decision.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry to hear about you’re child’s reaction to a vaccine. They can definitely have an adverse effect, and it pains me to hear your child had to go through that.</p>
<p>I just find the antivax sentiment in this sub a little disappointing considering what we all want. Hesitation makes sense, especially with something new, but full-blown anti-vax has me worried for the future.</p>
<p>Andrew Wakefield has caused a lot of harm in this world, all for money, and I think it’s important to share his apparent motive. I also like hbomberguy a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/0-w-pdqwiBw">WHOS GOING TO BUY THE HOUSES? AQUAMAN?!</a></p>

        <p>The anti vax movement did not start in the 90’s. 
In the late 1800’s in England, Canada and America for example, the smallpox vaccine was heavily enforced and people’s property was seized, fines were implemented and people were jailed- because their children or people they knew were harmed or killed by the vaccine and they didn’t want it. In the US- cops and surgeons went door to door to force vaccinate and anyone who refused was taken to court, hundreds of factory workers were locked into their work building until they were vaccinated against their will and a cop was killed in a riot over forced vaccination- for just a few of the many stories of what occurred. </p>
<p>People have been against them since they were rolled out and it’s because many have been harmed by them but it’s always covered up by those in power.</p>

        <p>Sorry, “modern” antivax and the MMR origins. Hbomberguy explains it more eloquently than me. Pretty sure the smallpox vax worked out well. Like really well (not to condone property theft or anything, just the efficacy of the vax, as you say — their harm came from the state not the vax)</p>

        <p>Actually, despite what we’ve all been told (I used to be quite pro vax myself), the smallpox vaccine didn’t work well. It killed people, made recipients sick, vaccinated individuals still got smallpox- and it spread smallpox. They actually discontinued the vaccine in the mid 1700’s in Europe- because it was spreading smallpox. (The oral polio vaccine did the same thing). 2 out of 3 died of every 100 vaccinated. In the years before vaccination- smallpox deaths were 90 per 1000. In almost 40 years after vaccination started, deaths rose
to 127 per 1000. </p>
<p>One of the pro vax doctors during that time, vaccinated 1200 people and when he saw how many still got smallpox and died- he stopped supporting the vaccine. This is what he said in The Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal in 1819- “The accounts from all quarters of the world, wherever vaccination has been introduced, the cases of failures are now increased to an alarming proportion”. </p>
<p>Another doctor from that time wrote that the vaccinated contract more severe smallpox must faster than the non vaccinated.
In the 1844 epidemic, one third of the vaccinated got mild smallpox, 8 percent of the vaccinated died and two thirds of the vaccinated had a severe case. 
Doctors also covered up smallpox vaccine deaths then- just as they do today with other vaccine deaths.</p>
<p>In the mid to late 1800’s, the public was starting to wake up to the facts about the vaccine and didn’t want it- and that’s when governments started cracking down and enforcing the mandates. More people
died from smallpox after the vaccine was mandated than before the mandates- and the severity of the epidemics increased as well- especially in vaccinated people. 
In Bavaria in 1871, out of the 30k smallpox cases- 29k were in the vaccinated. 1k cases- in the non vaccinated. That info is from the Encyclopedia Britannica which also states that “In some of the small local outbreaks of recent years, the victims have been nearly all vaccinated”.<br>
In Chicago in 1868, over 95 percent of the population was vaccinated due to mandated (they bribed people by only offering relief supplies after the Great Fire if they were vaccinated), but they had an epidemic in 1872 that resulted in many deaths. In Germany, between 1870 and 1885- they estimated that one million vaccinated persons died from smallpox. </p>
<p>The smallpox vaccine also killed people- some areas had 1 smallpox death to 300 hundred vaccine deaths, for example. 
One study in the US from 1970 claimed that “the risks of smallpox vaccination as currently practiced in the US are considerable. Surveillance of the complications of smallpox vaccination is poor, and the extent of underreporting is unknown. The observation that several deaths from diseases other than vaccinial complications were misclassified or erroneously reported as deaths from vaccinia raises the possibility that vaccinial complications may also be misdiagnosed or misclassified with other disease entities.  Some patients die of residual effects of central nervous system damage caused by postvaccinial encephalitis.” They basically admit the deaths by smallpox vaccine were higher than reported (nothing new). </p>
<p>There is so much more information on this topic but the fact is, the vaccine wasn’t the cause of smallpox ending. It actually contributed to worse infection rates. Proper hygiene, sanitation, nutrition, etc is what reduced smallpox and that’s the case for most illnesses. 
One town in England, Leicester, fought against forced vaccination and instead turned to quarantining the sick, disinfecting the homes of the sick and implementing better hygiene. They saw few cases after implementing this despite decreased vaccination. Compared to other towns in England with heavily vaccinated populations- they had far better success. The “anti vax” town had a death rate of 144 per million compared to other vaccinated towns that had 3600 per million deaths. A doctor during this time also noted that unvaccinated children were not effected by natural smallpox- but they were getting smallpox from vaccinated adults instead. In the end- Leicester kept smallpox at bay with only mild cases from time to time. 
All of this information is from medical journals and articles from the years mentioned. </p>
<p>All of this to say- we’ve been lied to for many years about vaccines being health saviors- using smallpox as the foundation. It was not a success and it made things worse. I believe the same is going to happen with these current jabs.</p>

        <p>How many people get small pox now, that’s the point I was trying to make. The answer is 0. But yeah, I’m sure a lot of people got sick from intravenous injections in the 1800’s, personally, I don’t know the facts on if it was vaccine or related to sterility and sanitation, but under modern conditions (the 1970’s), 1 or 2 out of a million died.</p>

        <p>I understand but the point I was making was the vaccine is not the reason smallpox was eradicated. It was a terrible vaccine yet it’s always used to “prove” how wonderful vaccines are and how they are the sole reason viruses have been reduced. If you look at any medical organization discussing smallpox- they all say the vaccine was the reason it was eradicated- that’s a lie. The WHO did mass smallpox campaigns in modern times and everywhere they did this- the cases went up. What they eventually turned to was quarantining the sick and improving on environmental factors- which is exactly what Leicester did years before. Jabbing everyone with an injection that bypasses the normal immune response has never been the answer for health yet that’s what they continue doing today when there are alternative ways to deal with viruses.</p>

        <p>&rt;so when most people are here are concerned about it, is it mostly directed at the mRNA vaccines or is it for all of them, including johnson's, which is non-mRNA and somewhat more trustworthy since its still the somewhat traditional one?</p>
<p>&rt;EDIT: Add AstraZeneca to that list too, sorry i forgot </p>
<p>A common misconception. However, these viruses use a genetically modified virus (adenovirus) with the genetic material to build the spike proteins instead of itself in its replication code. So instead of a lipid shell carrying mRNA, it is a virus shell around DNA. Nothing traditional about it, and none are FDA approved.</p>

        <p>All of them are bad.  Especially worse if you are religious.  Most contain the blood of other people (abomination), porcine material (abomination), aborted fetus material (abomination), and or genetically mix kinds/alter RNA/DNA (abomination).</p>
<p>For me, I don't even care if it works, my Father said no and that's the advice I'm going to stick with.</p>
<p>Fun bonus facts, the UN non-denominational chapel and the logo for Planned Parenthood both have the same thing in common - they contain the Eye of Molech (the god that they sacrificed infants too in the bible.)</p>
