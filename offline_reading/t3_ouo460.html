    <strong>How do you cope?</strong>
    <p><p>I've always tried to be understanding and compassionate towards the normies. I do use that the word "normies" cos you need to use some kind of word as a short-hand to refer to the majority of people ( fully paid up, fully vaxxed up members of the cult of whatever has been deemed to be "normality" this month). I don't use the word "sheeple" cos it dehumanises people.</p>
<p>But sometimes, you reach a kind of limit, and I'm there today. So I'll get right to the point and not get hung up on trying to say this "nicely". There isn't really a nice way of saying it.</p>
<p>How do you cope when you realise all your friends are basically dumbfucks?</p>
<p>Talking to them about anything that matters is like banging my head off a wall.</p></p>

        <p>I just don't mess with people like that anymore. I find it better to have a small group of like minded people. Why waste precious time?</p>

        <p>I agree wholeheartedly. I have a friend is a West Point grad. He is constantly in nasty FB arguments with liberal members of his cadet class. I swear to God, he is the most optimistic person I've ever met, never giving up trying to bring his brothers back to reality. But damn, at some point you have to write people off.</p>

        <p>So many people you can’t have a normal conversation with anymore. If you can’t, don’t. Just talk about something else. I’m friends with people that have what I think are idiotic beliefs and they I’m sure think I have the same. 
If they won’t shut up about whatever, just find a new friend.</p>

        <p>An ex-coworker posted "I avoid the unvaccinated like the plague" on his FB. He's a bedwetting liberal who purports to be more compassionate than those evil Republicans. I spent a minute thinking of something to respond with, but knowing him (and judging by his attaboy replies), it would fall on deaf ears. Still, it's an ugly thing to say.</p>

        <p>Lonely af. I can't tolerate the sheep. So I don't talk to them. And I have to call them that because that's part of how I cope. I know they are victims of propaganda, but no more than we are. They have dehumanized themselves with their ignorance. Or maybe they've always been like this. Circumcision is a plague of stupidity that's been going on for ages. A war of misinformation that pre dates the internet. We're fucked, but we've been fucked for a long time.</p>

        <p>I hear ya, it’s super hard and done by design to divide us.  Honestly at this point most people I know have picked a position on the vaccine.  I just hope to hell we can convince more people of the dangers of the passport.</p>

        <p>I’ve come to peace with the fact that if I’m wrong; the worse that’ll happen will be me looking like a looney and forever be known as “that guy” amongst my “friends” and family. However, if I’m right, and I hope I’m not, I’ll be watching my friends and family suffer terrible injuries or die. They’ve made their choice and I’ve made mine; I hope this turns out to be a big nothing burger and we can return to arguing about pronouns and shitty pro sports.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I hope so too. Like you, I'd rather be the idiot than the alternative where the warnings we gave to them because we care about them turn out to be accurate.</p>

        <p>How do you cope? One phrase:</p>
<p>"<em>Time for new friends.</em>"</p>
<p>That's why there's 100,000 of us here and it's growing every day. At any moment you have 3,000-4,000 people here with you that see eye to eye on this stuff!</p>
<p><em>Hello, friend!</em></p>
<p>You need it in real life, too, though... The best way to do that? Find your local group that is protesting this stuff. They're everywhere. Even if all you do is SHOW UP and be there to support them, you're doing a lot.</p>
<p>I took some action this morning and joined the Reopen San Diego group and went downtown for their press conference. They have a news covering it and are planning a MASSIVE showing at the next Board of Supervisors meeting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/cdc-study-shows-74percent-of-people-infected-in-massachusetts-covid-outbreak-were-fully-vaccinated.html">https://www.kusi.com/san-diego-man-calls-out-dr-wilma-wooten-for-using-propaganda-to-scare-the-public/</a></p>
<p>Your friends are calling you Typhoid Mary and ready to throw you in a quarantine camp? These are fair-weather friends. At least this situation shows you who they really are at their core.</p>
<p>The water heated up a little and their authoritarianism floated right up to the surface.</p>
<p>Find your local group! It's time to fight this thing in real life, and we have power in numbers! It's not as hard as it sounds. There are people willing to fight hard &amp; loud for our rights, and all you have to do is show up and have their back as they stand up against this oppression.</p>
<p>And if you have what it takes to lead? Do that! But the point is... We're all needed in this fight. Right now these groups are small and <em>every person counts</em>!</p>
<p>You will meet good people there. All kinds. The media makes us look like one caricature but what I saw today was ALL TYPES OF PEOPLE. The full spectrum of diversity in every way. We can all come together on this, and if we do we will <em>stop this machine</em>.</p>
