    <strong>Participants needed for study - COVID19, government measures and mental health</strong>
    <p><p>How has this global pandemic and consequent government measures affected our mental health? Professor Ian Gold and other researchers at the Neurophilosophy lab (McGill University) are conducting a study on mental health and trust during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are interested in how different beliefs and attitudes towards COVID19 impact mental health and cognition. The study will take approximately 25 minutes, will be conducted online and will be offered in English. You will be asked to answer a series of questions about your experiences, feelings, and beliefs, especially with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic and the government measures (social distancing, lockdowns, masks, etc) . By participating, you help researchers better understand the scope of people's beliefs, attitudes and opinions throughout this crisis, and how they may relate to mental health....The survey is completely anonymous. If you are interested in participating, click on this link: <a href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsurveys.mcgill.ca%2Fls%2F235426">https://surveys.mcgill.ca/ls/235426</a> which will take you to the survey. If you have any questions, please send us a Direct Message or contact us at <a href="mailto:neurophilosophylabmcgill@gmail.com">neurophilosophylabmcgill@gmail.com</a>.
