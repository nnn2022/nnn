    <strong>Question for religious people here.</strong>
    <p><p>If you think that the vaccine is the mark of the beast, you’re saying that god has bad judgement. If god is good, he will know that you’ve been bamboozled. What do you think about this? (Normal arguments please)</p></p>

        <p>I don't think that it is. The mark of the beast will be known as such; you won't be tricked into it. You are merely trying to set up a strawman for why people don't want this vaccine.</p>
<p>There are a ton of reasons, but they can all be boiled down to the following: You cannot lock people in their homes for over a year, ruin their lives, and take away much of what they hold dear, and then expect those same people to trust anything that you say. People have done their own risk calculations about the vaccine vs the risk of actually getting COVID, and come to the conclusion that it isn't worth it.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't call myself religious but i do remember a couple of things </p>
<p>God gave dominion of the earth and everything therin to mankind, he cannot interfere</p>
<p>He also gave mankind free will to choose his own path, something the governments seem to have forgot</p>
<p>Satan is the god (little g) of the earth but only to unbelievers and only has the power to influence and deceive, God warned mankind that satan will always try to deceive and to resist</p>

        <p>So god is bad, seeing that he is the cause of every bad thing and punishes the people he made bad for it forever. And he’s all powerful so he can interfere. And Satan doesn’t have to exist because he can just snap him out of existence but he doesnt. And we are not free, seeing as he knows everything we are going to do. So some of us are destined to go to hell and they can’t do anything about it</p>

        <p>I personally think the jab serves several purposes, but I don’t think it’s the mark of the beast. I would say it is preparation for the mark. </p>
<p>Several purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pharma gets to trial mRNA tech on humanity. All clinical trials ever undertaken are as a drop in an ocean compared to this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depopulation. All the major players in this are well-known depopulists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only do they get to try out their mRNA on a colossal scale, they also have tested the waters and found a large chunk of humanity not only willing but actually begging to be part of this increasingly fatal clinical trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The implementation of totalitarianism and martial law, and digital ID and social credit systems.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just off the top of my head, I’m sure there are more.</p>
<p>Repent (180 degree turn) and believe in Christ. He died for you so that your sins might be forgiven. One day He will wipe every tear from our eyes.</p>

        <p>1 It’s a new way of protecting you, just because it sounds scary doesn’t mean it will change you as a person. What they mean will altering your mRNA is that it will teach your body how to deal with the disease. 
2 What they mean with depopulation is not that they will kill people, it means that they’ll improve the living conditions and medical treatment in poorly developed countries. That caused depopulation because people won’t have ten children in the hopes of one surviving, just to have them all survive.</p>
<p>3 What is so fatal about this vaccine? Why do you think it’s fatal? I saw one post in this sub about the first one to take the vaccine dying even though she was around 90 years old. So it was gonna happen soon anyway.</p>
<p>4 Propose that the vaccine works and isn’t dangerous. Then a group comes who doesn’t understand it and therefor assumes it’s dangerous. There is a disease that people without the vaccine are way more likely to get. You would have to make sure that only the vaccinated get into certain places or the disease could be spread. </p>
<p>But what would you propose to be the solution.</p>

<p>Let’s see what happens in the winter/flu season with Antibody Dependancy Enhancement, and everyone’s (that is those who have had the mRNA gene therapy) immune systems go crazy. That’s what happened when they trialled mRNA on animals, and they were introduced to wild virus. They all died.</p>

        <p>An immune system is good, but vaccines make it better by introducing the disease and the antidote at once, so the body sees what it has to do in order to defeat it. And where is the proof of this experiment on animals? Maybe you misinterpreted it</p>

        <p>I don't think there will be trickery. Taking the "Mark of the Beast" involves worship and acceptance.</p>
<p>Revelation 14:9-11</p>
<p>&rt;9 Then a third angel followed them, shouting, “Anyone who worships the beast and his statue or who accepts his mark on the forehead or on the hand 10 must drink the wine of God’s anger. It has been poured full strength into God’s cup of wrath. And they will be tormented with fire and burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb. 11 The smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or night, for they have worshiped the beast and his statue and have accepted the mark of his name.”</p>

        <p>You say that those who accept it are punished. If an angel were to come down and tell us that it’s actually the mark of the beast, we could simply say that we don’t accept it and that we were tricked right?</p>

        <p>Not religious but I am a Christian.</p>
<p>Your question is loaded and insincere. </p>
<p>God is good. God has given us warnings in advance. </p>
<p>If you are injecting mRNA/cDNA into your body from transhumanist eugenicists who are working with government to make it impossible for you to even go to a grocery store without a vaxx passport (ie, Cyprus), then you never believed the warning of the Bible where Jesus said, "As in the days of Noah, so shall the days of the return of the Son of Man be..."</p>
<p>Is this the MOTB? Yes. It is the beta version of it. The complete one will be the unification of your vaxx passport, digital ID, central bank digital currency and on-person quantum dot smart patch tattoo. </p>
<p>Beta version of Firefox is still Firefox.</p>
