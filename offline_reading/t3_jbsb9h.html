    <strong>Anyone else notice that Asians are the most serious about coronavirus?</strong>
    <p><p>The Asians in my area are so extreme that they wear masks everywhere, even for a walk. They're so extreme that they're putting FACESHIELDS on their BABIES.</p>
<p>I can't figure out why this is the case. They're not even Chinese, they're mostly Filipino. I keep thinking that maybe they're not afraid of the virus but afraid of getting quarantined and unable to work, which would destroy them since most of them work minimum wage.</p></p>

        <p>I haven't noticed that where I live.</p>
<p>Could it be connected to the Philippines having one of the most extreme lockdown reactions, if most of the people ple you see doing this are Filipino?</p>

        <p>Not sure about how each race is treating this in my area, but the age demographics definitely show difference:  Gen Z and later millennials are usually the most batshit crazy over it. The older people (Older millennials, Gen X, Boomers,) are either apathetic or against restrictions entirely. I live close enough to the city and to a rural area, and the attitude changes dramatically as you move in and out of town.</p>

        <p>Yeah it’s all like pop culture and memes that have shaped their beliefs on this. Irony is I think many of them don’t practice what they are signaling. And so many I hear saying they are in “quarantine” still out and about, like they don’t know what that word even means.</p>

        <p>Strangely, I have seen the opposite: I live in a Japanese neighborhood, and they're the ones least likely to be wearing masks outdoors (everyone is required to wear them indoors, thanks Newsom). I was wondering if it's a news source thing: if you get your news from, say, NHK, rather than CNN or any other panic porn outlets, you're less likely to buy the bullshit Red Death virus narrative.</p>

        <p>I was standing behind an Asian lady to order food at a restaurant that had a walk-up window to order through. I guess I was too close for comfort because she sprayed the air with disinfectant! Funniest thing I've seen in my life! I'm normally pretty reserved but I had to laugh and yell to my boyfriend "this lady just tried to sanitize the outside air!"</p>

        <p>In my area, I live in Norway, there aren't any difference between ethnic groups. Almost everyone seems equally on board with this. Here, you're either a hypochondria or you're not. It's not a specific culture's thing. Everyone have equally access to news and media.</p>

        <p>I hate generalizing by ethnicity or nationality but yes I anecdotally notice Asian immigrant-owned businesses quite more extreme in covid restrictions, some Vietnamese restaurants near me I see still have no dining even though they could for months. Maybe it’s a cultural thing, or maybe they go overboard because there were some ignorant people blaming Chinese and other Asians for the virus early on. I don’t know</p>

        <p>Anecdotal, but: the first person I knew to wear a mask, in early March, long before the mandates, is Chinese. She was very scared of COVID19 at the time (though her fear has abated somewhat since then). She was even scared of taking of the bus! I also noticed at a local Chinese grocery store, some of the workers wore what looked like a full PPE suit. Never noticed that in any other kind of grocery store.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Kosher grocery store? Mask is slipping off their faces. And while I've found it rare to see a Chinese or Korean person not wearing a mask, it's also rare to see someone wearing a mask and a yarmulke. I once got lunch at a kosher falafel place and a kid came in with no mask. Never seen an Asian person do that. Also, Asian people are the only ones I've noticed wearing goggles.</p>
