    <strong>Anyone else think Biden's covid relief plan is terrible</strong>
    <p><p>The US  spent trillions of dollars more than usual last year (4.28 trillion)and if  the newest relief plan is passed as it is right now, we might go up another 1.9 trillion. </p>
<p>Am I not the only one who sees how bad this is? Your children and grandchildren are going to be fucked and will be the ones stuck paying this off. 22% of all circulating USD was printed last year,  we're literally setting the events needed to become Zimbabwe 2.0.</p>
<p>Even if you don't care about the amount, the actual plan is garbage. It includes making the minimum wage 15$ an hour.. how tf does that help when "wErE iN a PaNdEMIc" and 100,000 restaurants have gone out of business in the past 6 months , how will forcing the restaurants, who are barely still in business, to pay more to their employees going to help them? 
I personally feel like, even if you are pro lockdowns and are fearful of covid you should be able to realize wasting trillions on stupid shit, instead of attempting to reopen safely is dumb. Or maybe I'm giving them too much credit. See you guys soon when we become Zimbabwe 2.0</p></p>

        <p>It’s just going to make things worse. Not only are we inevitably going to get inflation but he wants to raise the minimum wage to $15. That means prices will go up more and they’ll lay off people.</p>

        <p>Yea raising the minimum wage is a small business killer. to pay for the wages, you're either raising prices (absolute no go for price sensitive customers) or you're cutting hours or benefits. and right now most small businesses are either bleeding cash or have barely balanced their budget on a razor's edge because of reduced capacity and online shopping. amazon can handle a raise in minimum wage no problem, your local business is probably shuttering their doors after this economic downturn. and they accuse republicans for being in favor of large corporations.. how does someone not see through that.</p>

        <p>Except that the bulk of small businesses were ALREADY paying at or higher than this minimum wage increase so in the real world, it will not affect them that much.</p>
<p>The businesses that it is going to affect are Wal-Mart and Target type businesses, who have been using the elderly and low-skilled as basically slave labor for many years.</p>
<p>How about a different tack: If a business has 25% or more of their employees on social assistance programs, then we hit them with a 100% tax rate on their profits?</p>

        <p>Not even close to true...</p>
<p>Big businesses like Amazon, Target, and Walmart have moved to a $15hr starting rate. (Not every position at Walmart though) It's the small businesses that can't afford this in some places. Cost of living varies so drastically that it makes no sense to have the national minimum that high. It needs to stay a local issue.</p>

        <p>Bullshit, this hurts the small businessman the worst which is what most of this country is made up of. Let's say you have a decent burger joint where you are selling burgers 12$ apiece and most of your kitchen staff is making 10 an hour. It's mostly high school kids and college kids using it as their first job. You can make payroll just fine and overhead but things are pretty lean otherwise, maybe you can open up another location in a few years. But now you're required to pay your employees a third more, all things being equal like hours and benefits. You can't shit out the extra cash and if you raise prices to meet the requirement your average customer is gone. You certainly can't hire anymore help because you can't afford it and you definitely aren't increasing benefits. One more business that kids can't work at. The accountant is looking at the spreadsheet and is saying to either cut hours or cut staff. That's the scenario this guy is thrown in, he can't expand, he has to most likely shrink, he sure as shit can't automate anything, and McDonald's across the street doesn't give a fuck about the minimum wage hike because they have the budget for an R and D department that is beginning to make its own hamburger. Soon their only 15$ minimum wage employees will be there to just turn on the machines and take out the trash. I'm only seeing more and more self checkout at Target, and a minimum wage hike is only going to decrease those with jobs and benefits.</p>

        <p>I think extending evictions until September is stupid. Those people will still owe the rent &amp; many small landlords are going to get fucked over. </p>
<p>I'm honestly asking how many people are currently facing eviction because they lost their jobs due to covid? There shouldn't be many considering how much in unemployment people received.</p>

        <p>What are we up to, like, 40% of ALL the US dollars in existence today were created out of whole cloth in the last 11 months?</p>
<p>In 2020 we spent almost an entire China solely on deficit. The annual Chinese budget, for a nation of 1.5 billion people, we spent that <em>in money we don't have</em>. 2020 by itself was a thermonuclear event for the dollar and we haven't even really begun to feel it bite yet. </p>
<p>Now these ninnies are promising more "haha money printer go brrr". If you're thinking about buying hard assets like property in the next few years, might wanna expedite those plans to right now, because the money you're saving for it ain't gonna be worth much.</p>

<p>Yup. Normalization of deviance. Once trillion dollar annual deficits became normal, it was pretty much over.</p>

        <p>Not just the United States... all nations. All nations have debt owed to each other and that is a good thing in the real world. It prevents China and the United States and Russia from actually starting direct shooting wars between each other.</p>
<p>Wars are relegated to proxies around the world which lose less life in the short and long run, as much as it pains people to admit it.</p>

        <p>Wars happen because those to whom the debt is owed have decided to steal more resources. Just because China, the US, and Russia are not directly warring with each other doesn't mean that millions of people are being spared; it just means a change in nationality of those killed. Neither debt nor proxy war does us any favors.</p>

        <p>This is incidentally almost exactly the same playbook used in the first great depression, business owners who were already struggling got hit with additional payroll due to introduction of the minimum wage that hastened the decline. Oh, then they confiscated everyone's gold, made it illegal to own gold and paid everyone less than half the actual spot price of gold, in USD, which as a double whammy they also rapidly devalued.  So, be careful with your assets.</p>

        <p>Honesty the money hasn’t been real for over 100 yrs. Every country in the world is bankrupt. They don’t care anymore and are eventually going to do what’s called a “debt jubilee”. This is an ancient trick that kings did where when they felt they were falling out of favor with the serfs they would forgive all the debt and restart it. That won’t happen for your mortgage and loans but it will happen for the national debt and state debts. Then they will transition us to a central bank digital currency. I put this timeline estimate around 2028-2032. Some countries are more behind than others on the tech</p>

<p>And by the way, leaving corporate taxes as before wouldn’t make a dent in our deficit. We don’t have a revenue problem; we have a spending problem. In case you haven’t been paying attention we have been running worsening deficits for the past twenty years.</p>

        <p>I don't have a double standard, I don't even agree with a majority of anything Trump says .And you're right, he's to blame for a majority of the debt last year, but Biden is adding onto it. If Trump was relelcted and made a 1.9 trillion dollar relief plan and it featured the same things as this one I would criticize it just as equally. Apparently to you anyone who's slightly questioning not staying inside all day and letting the economy be fucked is on Trumps side</p>

        <p>I'll take your word for it that you would also hold trump to this standard. I haven't yet read Biden's proposed stimulus bill. But my main issue with what's being offered by Republicans and Democrats is they're simply kicking the can down the road. There are going to be potentially hundreds of thousands of evictions in the coming months. That will wreck multiple markets and cause lots of job loss. Minimum wage is a much trickier problem. I would argue that if we got rid of corporate tax cuts and required the top 500 companies to pay into a wage fund we would come very close to covering the cost of raising the minimum wage. A more equal solution might be to find the minimum cost of living in each state, and then set the federal minimum wage to the average cost of living in a city or state. None of this is easy, and Biden's plan falls well short of addressing the most pressing needs we're facing. But at least he's trying to address it. Trumps administration has continually stalled every time legislation needs to be passed. My hope is Biden's administration can allow for significant infrastructure investment while curbing some of the ridiculous growth billionaires have experiencing during this pandemic.</p>

        <p>I agree with you on the fact that while Bidens plan may not be perfect, he's still  attempting to address issues that Trump didn't. I might have been a bit too hard on the criticism to be honest. I also agree  both sides have played a role in the "can kicking"  and not attempting to find viable solutions and addressing  the actual issues. We're in for a long ride with 2020 part 2 if things keep going the way they are.</p>

        <p>My fear is that we're going to continue to have Washington gridlock. That may not be the case since Georgia totally flipped, but we're running out of time to procrastinate. We have to do something about student debt. We have to do something about our healthcare system. Our roads and bridges are literally falling apart.
