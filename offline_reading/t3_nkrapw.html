        <p>The fact that this data does not immediately prompt the CDC to stop all vaccinations for that age group is sinister.  The liberals don’t want you drinking soda and using a plastic bag but they’ll pump our children full of experimental chemicals?  I don’t even think it’s about money anymore.</p>

        <p>Literally no one with a platform has those views. Its a strawman. Tackling climate change does have a population component, but the solution <strong>is not depopulation</strong>. Its just growth stabalization, achieved through better health outcomes, better access to education and work. Its basically make people too successful to want 19 children, and reduce that down to 1-3. We see this change in population growth with countries becoming a developed nation faster and faster, it taking the west centuries, while nations more recently achieving it only taking a few years. Its not through depopulation. Its through evil things like clean water and schools. ooooo so evil.</p>

        <p>I've had my vaccine for a month now, freely enjoying face-to-face interaction with others, in public. I haven't updated my avatar - for one - because I don't frequent Reddit enough to care about how my avatar looks - for two - because when it first came out, I like how it looked. The fact that you'll actively seek out excuses to dodge intellectual debate (see: "Virtue signaling!!!!!") instead of making a concise and accurate statement is unproductive. I could have dismissed you as illogical and proudly ignorant just by your presence in this sub, but because I can resist the temptation of lazily attacking someone directly, I'm able to properly rebut your personal attacks. Care to actually make a point, or are you going to make another personal attack?</p>

        <p>Then you are uneducated on the subject; deeply so. People do have kids. <strong>But how many</strong> and how often is the important part. What some CNN dickhead thinks is a fun backtrack from the claim but the facts still remain. Clean water and access to healthcare reduces population growth through population stabalization. You don't need 18 kids to support you in old age when you expect all 18 of them to actually survive till adult hood. As access to health care options, education, job opertunities go up, number of children go down. You rejecting reality does not change reality.</p>

<p>Look if you want a reason to hate bill gates, look at his actual business practices. He isn't for depopulation but he is still a bit of an asshole when it comes to his business practices. This is why you end up making the right look like idiots and turning this into an uphill battle against the dems. You exclusively believe false information, even if actual information supports your agenda you even reject them in favour of false strawmen.</p>

        <p>I'm actually surprised Pfizer is taking a gamble by offering the vaccine to 12-15 year olds. It doesn't make sense from a strictly mathematical view. Healthy 12-15 year olds have extraordinarily low rates of non-accident deaths. I don't know the exact rate, but it might be around 1 in 100,000 per year that die of some random acute health event. </p>
<p>If there is even a single death of a healthy 12-15 year old that can be connected to the vaccine in this group, then it would outweigh the benefits. If the vaccine gets halted in this group, then it will drastically lower its uptake this fall for the boosters.</p>
<p>Going further, there might be enough adverse reactions (myocarditis) to halt the vaccine as well. I know the FDA has enormous pressure not to pause the mRNA vaccines as they are the only ones not to have  paused.</p>
<p>So, from a strictly expected value calculation, it doesn't make sense to me. Huge risk for Pfizer with little gain (12-15 year olds will not make up much of the revenue).</p>

        <p>Huge risk but it opens up a global promise of more customers.  And, at this point, I question if the data will even tell the truth and the FDA will approve no matter what.  Maybe Pfizer knows this and wants people to get theirs in early so that booster season can start.</p>

        <p>Right--from the trial results it's patently obvious that a young person's overall health is more likely to be <em>worsened</em> from taking the vaccine. The only thing the vaccine (ostensibly) accomplishes is reducing the rate of PCR positive covid. But the PCR test result, in and of itself, is a meaningless endpoint. The point is (or should be) to improve people's health outcomes. If all covid cases are mild, yet vaccine reactions range from moderate to severe, then clearly the effects of the vaccine are worse than the effects of covid for this particular cohort. What benefit is the vaccine providing them? (None, obviously)</p>
<p>Not a single person in the trial came down with a serious case of covid (duh). So the trial, by definition, does nothing to show the vaccine's efficacy in reducing serious covid cases--how could it, when there were no serious cases to begin with, from either group?</p>
<p>They have completely lost the plot. They are singularly and irrationally focused on one thing: reducing the likelihood of testing PCR positive--actual health outcomes be damned!</p>

<p>Live virus challenge of animals given SARS or MERS vaccines resulted in vaccine hypersensitivity reactions (ADE), killing all test subjects within 2 years upon reinfection after variant reinfection. The ongoing development of this SARS and MERS vaccines were used to quickly develop current novel SARS2 vaccines. During trials of current vaccines, ADE was listed as a possible risk, only to be deleted from documentation for the public roll out.</p>

        <p>That was true for the first trials.  </p>
<p>They changed some of that for other trials, sometimes hidden from the reports,<br>
so one needs to double check what they were really using. And for safety we should never trust any of the companies own reporting. These companies have all been lying to us before. </p>
<p>The raw data is not open for peer-review (did not see any yet). And sometimes they only based the success on PCR tests, which can easily be manipulated with multiplication cycle counts. When looking at symptoms only, the mRNA did not show much improvements in the actual resistance against the disease (Peter Doshi Brittish Medical Journal 19% efffective).  </p>
<p>In real-world data, the public trials show complete different results per country. There is a lot of seasonal changes, due to the virus killing sun. From data seems that 70% of hospitalized c19 patients are now fully injected. In some hospitals 100%. And people that were already immune, got very sick of it again.  </p>
<p>Whatever "magic" they are doing, it is not working. The anti-bodies are not sufficient for these kind of viruses, while natural full spectrum immunity is.  We already knew that from the animal trials that it would probably not work. And they showed that these injections are dangerous on the long term.</p>

        <p>Did you notice 4 in the vaccine group had a serious adverse event? They said that's either death or a serious medical or surgical intervention. Did they die? Hopefully not but it isn't clear. 4 out of 1100 means everyone will know someone at their school having serious adverse events because of the vaccine! How many schoolchildren know any of their friends at school that suffered a serious adverse event from the virus? Probably very few.</p>

<p>There were 3 more serious events (2 vaccine vs 1 placeb0) 1 month after dose 2. It's not clear if these are different participants.</p>

        <p>So I was GOING to dig into this graph and pull it up for some of my friends until it turns out:<br>
That source website right there in the corner? Doesn't exist. This graph is completely fake. Proof? Okay.</p>

<p>While I understand you people are looking for good evidence to disprove the people with masks and vaxx, you should probably find some more definitive evidence than a graph without a working source.</p>

        <p>I made a mistake and did not know the www portion was necessary when I created the graph. </p>
<p>www.fda.gov/media/148542/download</p>
<p>You think someone would make a fake graph and put the source only to have it be a broken link? Why not just forgo putting the source on the graph in the first place?</p>
<p>Why isn't your first guess that the link on the image is incorrect? I'm guessing that you saw the data, realized it was bad for your side, and tried to find a reason to discredit it. When you saw the broken link, you immediately presumed (incorrectly) that the data was wrong. This thinking is the heart of confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance. You wanted so bad for the information to fit your world view that you couldn't think of other reasons why the link was not working.</p>
<p>The correct link was also provided in this thread. You didn't even take the time to go through the thread. You eagerly posted your assertion, proud of your poor investigative work. You could have also done a quick web search to verify the information.</p>
<p>This is an important lesson for you, and I've taken the time to outline your incorrect thinking, which with practice, you can change to be more open so that your world view can be challenged with new data.</p>

        <p>Excellent response! It's very difficult to admit mistakes as humans. One thing I try to do is detach my self-worth from the outcome. This allows me to more readily admit mistakes and have a more objective viewpoint.</p>

        <p>Fascinating. I mean, that's better than I expected for a <strong><em>relatively</em></strong> rushed and untested vaccine. Most vaccines need decades of testing before it's approved. Heck, I was expecting "Hospitalizations: 0.5%". The titles also kind of misleading, it seems to say that the vaccine is an injection of nothing helpful while making it pretty painful for a couple of days. While yes, COVID isn't that likely to be deadly to an individual, in large numbers, percentages add up</p>
<p>500K sample population</p>
<p>0.1% COVID fatality rate</p>
<p>1% serious COVID complications</p>
<p>500 dead</p>
<p>5000 hospitalized</p>
<p>The vaccine though? Up to possibly 400-500 hospitilized. Maybe 2-3 deaths. Much better odds, in my opinion.</p>

        <p>0-19 year olds. I was working on people in general, and studies(the one you sent) show that children have a much lower chance to catch a death-bringing dose of COVID-19. </p>
<p>Pulling a random percentage from this here <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality</a> </p>
<p>UK: 2.9% death rate from COVID</p>
<p>Now, lets assume there are 200 million people who caught covid before it goes away (currently 176 million and possibly even lower if the b i g p h a r m a is lying)</p>
<p>200 million * 2.9% death rate = 5,800,000 dead</p>
<p>Even assuming half of all covid cases are fake, thats still 2.9 Million people dead. Thats a lot of dead people.</p>

        <p>You don't seem to get it. The study that's linked ITT is about 12-15 year olds. So you should apply a 0.00017% mortality rate (which /u/shops_shops_shops linked) to the age category in this study to properly compare. You'll find that vaccine outcomes are worse than non-vaccine outcomes.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to compare the rate of hospitalizations. My guess is that those are also higher for the vaccine cohort than for the non-vaccine cohort. Again: for this age range, not for some random age range that includes very old feeble people.</p>

        <p>This appears to be a list of temporary symptoms, not outcomes of efficacy compared to contracting COVID-19. This simply shows that there is a response to the vaccine (which is expected/desired) above that of the placebo. I would be far more concerned is there was no difference. This chart is but one small piece of a very large puzzle and must be considered in context.</p>

        <p>Vaccines have side effects, they always have and always will. They work by making your body make antibodies for the virus, sometimes giving you a fever and cold-like symptoms. </p>
<p>You know what does have side effects: COVID 19. It makes you sick, tired, gives you headache and there is evidence of it even giving you blood clots. And most importantly, you can die!</p>

        <p>Both vaccine and covid 19 can be asymptomatic as symptomatic (why do you and others wore mask this whole time if you are healthy?). Vaccine also gives you blood clots and can kill you. They do in the end contain same spike protein that's been ruled out as cause of blood clots.</p>

        <p>Trusting information from BeachMilk, of all sources, is unbecoming of any actual intellectual debate. Their popularity feeds off of confirmation bias - wanting something to be real so badly that you'll ignore or falsely de-legitimize evidence of the contrary. Other articles from BeachMilk in the last few months include "Aussie wildfires caused by extremist muslim groups", "US election was rigged psyop" and "ANTIFA behind Jan 6th attacks" stories. Seriously. These are not legitimate sources of information, and what they're presenting to you is meant to take any real data and portray in a way that fits the confirmatiom bias.</p>

        <p>This logical fallacy is unbelievably stupid, and it blows my mind how prevalent it is online.</p>
<p>So if an idiot walks up to you and says the sky is blue, you won't believe him because he's a idiot? The middle man doesn't matter whatsoever, the information itself is all that matters. I don't give a shit what the twitter account has said in the past, it is completely irrelevant. Attacking the credibility of the person sharing the data instead of attacking the data itself is a classic ad hominem fallacy that makes it abundantly clear to anyone with a brain how much of a dumbass you are. You don't have to agree with the idiot's interpretation, but discounting the data itself is incredibly illogical and stupid.</p>
<p>If you took three minutes to use google, you would find <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html#persons-12-15yrs">the actual data</a> on the CDC's website, and believe it or not it is all accurate.</p>
<p>Now, looking at the actual data itself, of course the numbers should look like this - everyone knows that the shot has side effects, while a saline placebo won't have the same amount. That's not the point. The important takeaway is that there were a significant number of severe side effects from it, while all of the Covid cases on both sides were "mild/moderate". Why should I put myself at risk for these severe side effects from the vaccine when getting Covid has a far lower chance of causing any problems?</p>
<p>Going to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC's website</a> again, we see that a TOTAL of 295 people under 17 have died from Covid, nearly ALL of which had comorbidities listed on the death certificate. Covid ranks behind suicide, car accidents, and a variety of other causes of death over that time period.</p>
<p>The risk-reward analysis makes it abundantly clear. The belief that this virus will cause any problems for a healthy child is based entirely in fear and has no supporting evidence. The death rate for them is so close to zero that it is statistically irrelevant, and the hospitalization rate is barely any higher. The vast majority of children will also be fine after getting the shot, but what's the point? You're taking a risk for literally zero reward.</p>
<p>And don't give me that "but there might be some hidden long term side effects from Covid!" because the same can be said about a vaccine without FDA approval.</p>
<p>It's a different story for the high-risk elderly people, but for healthy children and young adults there is no logical reason to get it outside of "protecting the vulnerable" - and now that the vaccine is readily available, it is obscene to expect millions and millions of people to take this risk to protect the few high-risk people who can't get it.</p>
<p>You are rolling the dice on your child's life and health whether you decide to give them the vaccine or not. I simply believe the evidence clearly shows that your odds are better if they don't get the shot.</p>

        <p>Firstly, I've read the document BeachMilk cites, and my point again is the fact that the information is presented in a manner meant to elicit confirmation bias. The side effects are for two to three day periods, and are non-viral. Does anyone in this sub consider that a vast majority of households across the world - especially American Households - have both young children AND elderly residents? The idea isn't to prevent Covid deaths in exclusively children, the idea is to prevent spread in children, who make up a huge portion of the viral spread liable population, putting everyone from other children, immunocomprimised adults and elderly, and even the every-so-often unlucky child that does suffer a severe Covid case, comorbidities or not, at risk too.
 If an idiot walked up to me and said the sky was blue, I'd believe him. If the same idiot told me not to vaccinate my kid based on a single data set taken out of a of a CDC document detailing why it's crucial we reach herd immunity, and what barriers are in the way of doing so, I'd tell people not to fucking listen.</p>

        <p>If the elderly people in the household are vaccinated, why does it matter if the kids are?</p>
<p>If the elderly person can’t get the vaccine for medical reasons, then sure the kid living with them can get it as well, but expecting 80,000,000 children to get it to protect a select few is unbelievably selfish and unrealistic. </p>
<p>Also, the document i linked is from the CDC and has no “confirmation bias”, or any bias at all for that matter. I don’t care who or what BeachMilk is, and anything involving them or their opinions has no point in this discussion.</p>

        <p>I think we have differing ideas of 'selfish' when it comes to enduring minor side effects to mitigate risk of others dying. </p>
<p>I'm not calling into question the legitimacy of the CDC document, only the manner in which the information from it is presented on this post, from a source whose reputation is spreading misinformation through selectively presenting data.</p>
<p>The fact that the post contains </p>
<p>"In other words, NOT taking the vaccine is WAY healthier than taking it" </p>
<p>is exactly the case, it's meant to lead those who view the information through that post to the conclusion that the vaccine is unhealthy and shouldn't be taken, at all, using just one data set from a document, that if fully read and understood, would inform the reader that the vaccine is, in fact, healthy enough to be used en masse to prevent a continued viral pandemic.</p>

        <p>Thanks! The entirety of this document provides information that flies in the face of the two-second conclusion BeachMilk comes to, again, proving my confirmation bias point, and that nobody who's interested in honest, intellectual debate would use BeachMilk's posts as a point.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, these are all symptoms that are well agknowledged and forewarned about, ergo; they tell you what's going to happen in advance. Of course the placebo doesn't have high rates of the aforementioned side effects; the active mRNA ingredient is absent, and doesn't replicate the inert protien spikes that cause the prolonged immune system response. Instead, the placebo contains the normal ingredients, sans-mRNA dose. These ingredients, on their own, can cause a minor amount of the same reactions, simply by the merit of being an intramuscular injection consistent of something your body recognizes as foreign. </p>
<p>For those of you saying "It's better not to take it!!!!!": </p>
<p>Sure, if you have a comprimised immune system or pre-existing condition, don't take it. It'll wreak havoc on your immune system. But frankly put: denying your child the vaccine and instead exposing them to the coronavirus will have lasting complications that far outweigh the two days of fever and side effects the vaccine gives. Damaged lung capacity, weakened insulin production, and possibly death. 
It concerns me just how many people are willing to roll the dice on their lives, as well as their children, while riding the high they get by claiming they know what's best for their child, as if they've studied immunologistics and virology.</p>

        <p>Hello, friend. I am 43. I had COVID in December. I felt rough for a few days. Now I know I have antibodies and I haven’t had any dangerous side effects. The Red Cross wants me to donate blood more often than I can because they want antibodies for people who cannot get the vaccine. Almost all children in this age group will fight off COVID when exposed and propagate antibodies. I don’t know that your logic is the most rational.</p>

        <p>You're not DEFINITELY going to get sick from the vaccine. You MIGHT get sick from the vaccine.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the likelihood of severe symptoms from COVID is substantially higher than the likelihood of severe symptoms from the vaccine.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a tiny percentage of people who may experience severe side effects from the vaccine, who may have not shown any symptoms had they contracted COVID. But the minescule percentage of the population that this can be applied is key to making a rational decision. The probability of that is ludicrously low.</p>
<p>I'm playing the percentages, you're playing whatever percentages you have come up with. But at least me taking the vaccine doesn't potentially impact those around me. Unless of course the vaccine turns everyone into zombies. I'll take my chances...</p>
<p>The reality for the majority of people is that feeling a bit rough for a day after the vaccine is substantially better than the potential risks involved with COVID.</p>
<p>And don't try to shame me. Just because I don't agree with you doesn't mean I'm trying to muddy the waters. You're the one with the "alternative" theory.</p>

        <p>Does it though? Because you're still comparing apples to oranges.</p>
<p>You're effectively trying to argue that "people who are dropped into the ocean wearing a life jacket are significantly more at risk than those who stay on the boat wearing no life jacket." Obviously that's true, but it isnt a remotely useful statistic.</p>
<p>But what we should be comparing is who fares better when everyone is dropped in the ocean. Those wearing life jackets or those not.</p>
<p>The majority of people who get on a cruise ship aren't going to fall over the side. And the majority of cruise ships complete their journey without a hitch.

        <p>&rt;Does it though?</p>
<p>Yes, because the situation of a person who hasn't received the covid injection is a person whose risk from a severe case of covid isn't simply the infection severe case risk because <strong>not every person can or will be infected with covid</strong>. </p>
<p>This is known as "absolute" risk comparisons. You simply assuming 100% infection, which magically suits your agenda, overlooks this reality.</p>

<p>or to make this derpy analogy one which is better, it would be like making people wear life jackets in the middle of Missouri because they could, at some point, maybe, get on a cruise ship in the future</p>
<p>your comparison is dishonest and dumb; it's the same sort of derpy nonsense talking about high relative risk reductions when the absolute risk reduction from the injection for getting COVID at all is ~.6% (the actual number from the drug trials) which wasn't even confirmed with actual testing</p>

        <p>Do you have research to show that if the government did nothing during the pandemic, and there was no lockdown, that the vast majority of people wouldn't have caught COVID?</p>
<p>Sure, there is a small percentage of the population who are immune. And sure, there is a small percentage of the population who, through sheer luck, will avoid getting COVID. There is also a small percentage of people who are sufficiently isolated that the risk of contracting the virus is incredibly low. But the key is that those people are the minority.</p>
<p>If someone from Missouri has no intention of ever getting on a cruise ship, and has no intention of ever going near water, then sure, they may decide not to wear the life jacket. But the vast majority of people are at risk of infection.</p>
<p>Just look at how high the numbers are compared to the annual flu, and that is IN SPITE of the lockdown measures. The logical assumption is that zero lockdown measures would have resulted in an even higher number of cases.</p>
<p>You can try and claim this isn't a big deal, but you would be wrong. The fact that a tiny proportion of people are immune, isolated or lucky, doesn't mean that the majority of people shouldn't get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>in the real world, 100% infection rate is impossible</p>
<p>the vast majority of people didn't catch covid in places with few or no restrictions at all</p>
<p>&rt;But the key is that those people are the minority.</p>
<p>Okay. And yet that "minority" renders your 1 to 1 comparison between covid infection and covid injection plainly wrong and overestimating the "risk from covid"</p>
<p>&rt;If someone from Missouri has no intention of ever getting on a cruise ship, and has no intention of ever going near water, then sure, they may decide not to wear the life jacket</p>
<p>that's not the analogy</p>

<p>&rt;Just look at how high the numbers are compared to the annual flu</p>
<p>&rt;and that is IN SPITE of the lockdown measures</p>
<p>1) the "annual flu" estimates are... bad estimates; if the annual flu was tested with PCR tests at 40+ amplification cycles similar to covid, you would see similar numbers of cases</p>
<p>2) the lockdowns did not affect the spread of covid</p>
<p>&rt;The logical assumption is that zero lockdown measures would have resulted in an even higher number of cases.</p>
<p>that's your intuitive assumption; it is not a conclusion based on evidence</p>
<p>&rt;The fact that a tiny proportion of people are immune, isolated or lucky, doesn't mean that the majority of people shouldn't get the vaccine.</p>
<p>it's not "a tiny proportion"</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not using data, I'm using logic.</p>
<p>logic, even if done correctly, is only as good as the assumptions</p>
<p>your assumptions are shit</p>

        <p>&rt;in the real world, 100% infection rate is impossible</p>
<p>Ok, I never said anything about 100% infection rate.</p>
<p>&rt;And yet that "minority" renders your 1 to 1 comparison between covid infection and covid injection plainly wrong and overestimating the "risk from covid"</p>
<p>What are you on about? I'm saying the people who legitimately are at very low risk of infection are a tiny proportion of the population , so therefore only a tiny proportion of the population have a valid argument for not needing the vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;the analogy is that they may, maybe, could, possibly in the future get on a cruise ship</p>
<p>Right, and my argument is that anyone who decides they are at a minor risk of infection may decide against it. But the problem is that conspiracy theorists think they are part of this group, but they're not.</p>
<p>&rt;1) the "annual flu" estimates are... bad estimates; if the annual flu was tested with PCR tests at 40+ amplification cycles similar to covid, you would see similar numbers of cases</p>
<p>I'm not talking about estimates. The number of people who DIE from the flu are significantly outnumbered by the number of people who have died from COVID. And that is IN SPITE of lockdowns.</p>
<p>&rt;2) the lockdowns did not affect the spread of covid</p>
<p>You cannot possibly state that as fact unless you had an IDENTICAL control group. Which we don't.</p>
<p>&rt;that's your intuitive assumption; it is not a conclusion based on evidence</p>
<p>Ok, I don't get your point?</p>
<p>&rt;it's not "a tiny proportion"</p>
<p>Yes, it is. 82.46% of the American population live in an urban area. That means 82.46% of the population are at a reasonable risk of contracting any communicable disease or virus at some point. That's not taking into account those who live in reasonably well populated non-urban areas.</p>
<p>The number of people who actually live in a place, or live a lifestyle, that would make them extremely low risk of infection is tiny. Even if we take the entire population of people who live outside of urban areas, thats still only 17.54%. Which is hardly a substantial percentage.</p>

<p>two, even if it is, it renders your statement as plainly incorrect</p>

<p>muh conspiracy theorists</p>
<p>&rt;I'm not talking about estimates. The number of people who DIE from the flu are significantly outnumbered by the number of people who have died from COVID. And that is IN SPITE of lockdowns.</p>
<p>the annual numbers you see are estimates</p>
<p>the way flu estimates are made aren't in the same zipcode as the way covid infections or deaths have been counted</p>
<p>&rt;You cannot possibly state that as fact unless you had an IDENTICAL control group. Which we don't.</p>
<p>we have over a year of data across over a hundred different countries and billions of people which show lockdowns did not affect the total number of people infected</p>
<p>&rt;Ok, I don't get your point?</p>
<p>it's just your statement; there is no reason for me to accept or think it's true in any way whatsoever</p>
<p>&rt;Yes, it is. 82.46% of the American population live in an urban area. That means 82.46% of the population are at a reasonable risk of contracting any communicable disease or virus at some point. That's not taking into account those who live in reasonably well populated non-urban areas.</p>
<p>one, this is your bullshit statement unsupported by anything... an easy way to see why is that urban areas, even in places with few, if any, restrictions or lockdowns did not see anything even remotely close to 100%</p>
<p>two, imagine someone making the statement that <strong>17.5%</strong> of the population is "tiny" </p>
<p>lmao</p>

<p>So no identical control group then.</p>

<p>Why do you keep going on about 100% infection? Just because something isn't 100% doesn't mean it should be immediately dismissed.</p>
<p>&rt;two, imagine someone making the statement that 17.5% of the population is "tiny" </p>
<p>Imagine thinking that 0.000something% of people experiencing serious side effects from the vaccine <em>isn't</em> tiny.</p>
<p>When we are talking about what percentage of the population can legitimately claim they don't need the vaccine, 17.5% is tiny. Especially given that I clearly pointed out that the percentage of people who can legitimately justify that don't need the vaccine is substantially lower. I was using crude stats to prove how low the % is even without taking into account those in semi-rural areas (who in my opinion are still at a reasonable risk of contracting communicable diseases and viruses).</p>
<p>If you did a poll of who likes bubblegum flavoured ice cream, and 17.5% said yes, you'd say an insignificant portion of society like bubblegum flavoured ice cream.</p>
<p>Honestly, this debate is ridiculous because you just have an insane argument for everything. You're not conducting a rational debate, you're being pedantic because you MUST be right. I can't be bothered engaging with you anymore.</p>
<p>If you dont want to get the vaccine, then don't get it. But stop trying to convince everyone else that they're idiots for getting it. If you want people to respect your decision then stop questioning everyone else's. I just hope that your decision doesn't negatively impact you or your family.</p>

        <p>Let's not isolate this to Americans... idiots are everywhere.</p>
<p>Disenfranchised people are dangerous, but governments continue to ignore them. Treating them like idiots only makes it worse.</p>
<p>They have constructed their own set of ideals and morality because they have become so disconnected from the ideals and morals set out by the rest of society. They dismiss common media sources as polluted, biased and propaganda to give more weight to less mainstream data. Better yet, in their mind, any gaps in research (in the less mainstream data) is because the mainstream media/government is keeping it covered up. No matter which way you position your argument, they have a maniacal retort that, at best, is based on questionable logic and, at worst, is aggressive and hateful.</p>
<p>It's incredible how deep it is. If I was a sociology scholar, I would for sure do some research around conspiracy theorists. It's fascinating. There are a lot of similarities between those who commit crimes, join gangs, etc, and those who are conspiracy theorists, from a sociological perspective, that is.</p>
<p>Society has failed these people, but we (myself included) mock them instead of trying to help. The issue is, they are rejecting help so angrily that it makes it impossible to do anything else but either mock them or pity them. They are lost causes.</p>
<p>I'm all for freedom of speech, but I worry about how dangerous conspiracy theory subreddits are (and other conspiracy communities). I'm all for challenging discussion that looks to question the mainstream narrative, but not when you completely lose track of reality. They're so deep in the forest that they have no way out.</p>

        <p>Because I foolishly started down the rabbit hole last night and now I can't get over how close they are to realizing their argument is stupid. Yet they somehow make the information fit their narrative. It's like it's so stupid it almost becomes impressive?</p>
<p>I read someone say "there are more vaccine derived Polio outbreaks than naturally derived Polio outbreaks" yesterday as a way of proving that vaccines are bad. It's like... you were so close.</p>
