    <strong>Doomers are basically antivaxxers</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Disclaimer: This isn't a post meant to debate or question the validity of anti-vaccine arguments. I'm not arguing for or against here, just calling into focus the hypocrisy.</strong></p>
<p>For the longest time now, a common point that everyone and their grandmother (RIP) liked to make against anti-vaxxers has been that they cherry-pick isolated evidence out of a pile to prove their point, and ignore anything that might challenge that opinion. There's even that meme that I'm sure you saw, the whole "I have 100 studies that say they don't, and 1 that does," and the person picks the one.</p>
<p>It's actually quite fascinating to see that the doomers and the media have basically fallen into the exact same pattern now. They have become just how they claim anti-vaxxers are. </p>
<p>In their case, it's a little more severe even. They usually don't even acknowledge the existence of conflicting evidence, because most of the time it's banned, auto-censored, and canceled before people even have a chance to properly review and address it. When they do acknowledge it, you get the standard, "It's been debunked!" and "That's misinformation!" </p>
<p>So when doomers come to the sub, just remember that they're doing exactly what they accuse antivaxxers of doing. And maybe we all do it, confirmation bias is, of course, human nature to a degree. But something tells me the other side doesn't see it like this, and think they're the paragons of science and truth.</p></p>

        <p>A good observation. I mean honestly it's easy to be close minded but sometimes hard to admit when you're wrong. If we all tried a little harder to understand one another's point of view, it probably wouldn't be so bad.</p>
<p>I'm definitely part of the problem too because I don't want to give ignorance a chance lol</p>

        <p>Let's be real though, They are doing what they <strong>accuse</strong> the "antivaxcers" of.  But that's not what the anti-vaxcx people do - they are more correctly called "vaccine-safety-advocates" and are not anti-vaccine.  They are pro-vaccine-safety.  The folly is that advocating for vaccine safety (the shit is not safe) amounts to calling BS on the false claims that the vaccines are either safe or effective - neither has been proven.  </p>
<p>Yes, it's dogma. And the white coat of the doctor has replaced the robes of the priest.  The vaccine's safety and effectiveness are not to be questioned but upon pain of torture!  The sacrament of vaccines will absolve you of your heresy.  Any dangerous side effects are not due to the vaccine, but are your penance for weak faith.  As our world has turned more secular since the 1950's, scientistic-atheism has largely replaced religion.  We are now in the middle of a new-world-order Spanish Inquisition.</p>

        <p>Exactly, that's what I meant with my post, and what I tried to address with the disclaimer. It's the accusation, not the validity itself. Whether or not vaccines are safer dangerous is a whole different conversation, I just find it so ironic that these people are behaving in the exact same way as the people they have demonized.</p>
