    <strong>On the suspicious origins of the novel coronavirus</strong>
    <p><p>I am deeply concerned about the novel coronavirus. It is upsetting me more than it is upsetting most people right now. Undeniably, this virus is more dangerous than the flu. However, getting sick is the least of my concerns when it comes to this particular virus. Being exposed to the virus is unavoidable, almost to the point of being inevitable. What scares me to no end is the answer to the question “where did the novel coronavirus come from?”</p>
<p>Have you heard of a scientist named Luc Montagnier? Well, I have and I almost wish I hadn’t ever heard of him because of how much distress his words cause me. Either way, I cannot ignore his work because of its immense significance and relevance to a variety of subjects. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7654214.stm">He won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2008 for his discovery of HIV</a> and has consistently been at the forefront of studying viral infections and medicine. A couple of things make his life stranger than fiction. For one, <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/luc-montagnier-covid-created-lab/">he has claimed that that the novel coronavirus was manufactured in a lab by biologists who were working on a treatment for AIDS</a>. How strange is that? What reason would the person who discovered HIV have to lie about something like this? It is baffling and the fact that this gets ignored is beyond my understanding. What is even more strange is the fact that he isn’t the only one with expertise in the area who thinks this is the case. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2lHxRAUGrCIobTdP01YEFy">Francis Boyle, the person who basically wrote the American bioterrorism and biosafety laws, goes several steps further by saying that the virus is an offensive bioweapon (in a podcast interview)</a>.  </p>
<p>The National Biosafety Laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology has been at the centre of the coronavirus controversy since the beginning and for good reason. <a href="http://www.cambridgeworkinggroup.org/">These level 4 “biosafety” labs </a><a href="http://www.cambridgeworkinggroup.org/">across the world are nothing more than cesspools waiting to deploy bioweapons or inadvertently harm the ecosystem in a premature attempt at “defense”</a>. The ethical issues posed here are immense and will affect us all for generations to come. Lets not be quick to blame the Chinese on this issue either. It is worth noting here that these kinds of facilities and this kind of research cannot exist without American influence or involvement in some capacity. In fact, the American government pioneered this kind of research to begin with and <a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/covid-19-origin-virus-shrouded-in-mystery-heres-why-1.1588101149319">the US government </a><a href="https://gulfnews.com/world/covid-19-origin-virus-shrouded-in-mystery-heres-why-1.1588101149319">even funded research in that same lab in Wuhan, investing millions into studying bat coronaviruses ironically</a>. Legal documents show that the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/harvard-university-professor-and-two-chinese-nationals-charged-three-separate-china-related">American research at the Wuhan lab caused legal problems for a Harvard professor</a>.  </p>
<p>I think it is suffice to say that the two experts I mentioned earlier, Francis Boyle and Luc Montagnier, are way more credible than any so called “expert” the MSM has brought on to talk about the issue. Yet we have all collectively decided to ignore these two while focusing on “experts” who have little to no expertise but a diametrically opposed opinion. I cannot put to words how much this frustrates me. The folks from the mainstream media are the biggest sophists in contemporary society. In the best case scenario, they are steering the public into mass hysteria due to a complete lack of understanding and an inability to grasp nuance. I can’t even fathom what the worst case scenario looks like for the sake of my own sanity.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this virus is clearly harmful enough to scare everyone to no end but not dangerous enough to kill people in large numbers.</p></p>

        <p>lol it wasn't created in a lab. they found a similar virus in bats 7 years ago. however it is a btech virus as it has barely killed 1 million people</p>

        <p>They found bat coronaviruses which showed potential for human transmission but could human transmission have occurred overnight instead of over several generations? The truth is we don't know if it was made in a lab and since we have experts that say this is the case, it is worth investigating...</p>

        <p>Yes you are right it was actually developed in Wuhan and got out by a miscreant.</p>
