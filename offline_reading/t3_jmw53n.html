<title>What is it about the govt/people in the states that makes some have stricter rules than others? I know it's usually republicans, but some republican governors are super strict. Is it something in the water? Is it how widespread an appreciation for life is, or how widespread elitism is?</title>

        <p>We have Doug Ford in Ontario in Canada who is a conservative and he is an absolute maniac for lockdowns.</p>
<p>BC is left (NDP) and although there are restrictions for swimming and large gatherings, life continues largely as normal.</p>
<p>I don't think this is a left vs right thing.. it just appears to be.</p>

        <p>Yeah I have noticed a few things. I am trying to get at the bottom of the psychology of what's different in different people. Ofc this may not matter with the NWO anyway lol. But like one thing I noticed is the elitism correlation. My community college friends seem to value their freedom, understand hard work, and don't blindly follow authority. My fancy pants college friends get BONERS for losing freedoms. Their lives are still bougie no matter what, they love controlling people, they love blaming poor people who don't have their same luxuries for "the spread". And they think they get to lose some of their white guilt or something by being heroes and stay at home losers.</p>

        <p>"I know it's usually republicans, but some republican governors are super strict."</p>
<p>That one sentence, alone, should make people feel very uncomfortable. It sums up so much of what is wrong right now. Elected officials are not our fucking parents or gaurdians. They are supposed to be public servants, doing what we need or want them to do. That's why they are chosen, by the people, every election. That's the way it used to be. That's the way it should be now. Elected officials were never supposed to have the power to do things that could be viewed as strict or lenient. </p>
<p>What a fucking mess. "Some governors are super strict." Christ, its like we're talking about kings and queens now.. I never thought I would see any of this shit in my lifetime.</p>

        <p>Yeah I know we fought wars in the middle east theoretically against tyrants, they made women wear masks, prevented women from driving, and silenced dissentors. Now in America you are mandated to wear masks and in my state now, they control who is in your car, ie if it's people not in your household they need masks. Funny...</p>

        <p>yeah I figured it was a left vs right thing mostly. But wondering say if we had a democrat president who somehow left this up to the states. Would the right still be supportive of this freedom? I know the right on paper should care about that more. But trying to get at the root of what makes certain groups want to be freer. Is it the south/rural areas bc they are right wing and support freedom? Do they support freedom bc they appreciate life more and are not as elitist?</p>

<p>I'm not sure you understand how the laws work. The democrat president has no real choice there.</p>
<p>&rt;Would the right still be supportive of this freedom?</p>
<p>You mean the states freedom to govern their own state? That's why states have legislatures and governors and courts.</p>
<p>&rt; But trying to get at the root of what makes certain groups want to be freer.</p>
<p>Fair enough. In general, people either believe more government is the answer or people believe less government is the answer. (Most political options are basically yes or no and the reason we end up with 2 parties really.)</p>
<p>For most people their personal upbringing and how they were taught to think politically is a major part of it - their nature so to speak - and then they have their own personal interactions with government - the nurture - and the combination of the two leads them to their decision.</p>
<p>It splits more left and urban and right and suburban for sure. In general, if you live in a big city your life is dependent on more communal things like transportation and just availability of living space and being around people more and exposed to the societal pressures of "rightthink" and even dependent on those group actions more than people in rural areas... but there is no set pattern to how anyone will definitely think in the end. The most predictive factor is political party I think.</p>

        <p>Well the president could abuse federal laws and enact mandates, ignoring states rights. Which is why a Biden win is pretty scary. Some people feel it's not gonna matter either way, and I get that. </p>
<p>I personally think it is a little deeper than party. A lot of old conservatives have been brainwashed into fear, but that's not surprising. A lot of leftists are starting to think lockdowns etc hurt the poor more/ recognize this type of abuse of freedom is going too far.</p>
<p>I see in Atlanta that people are going out even though it is a liberal city. New Hampshire is liberal but when I was there it seemed so chill about masks. So I think there really is something in the water. But the biggest predictor is party for sure.</p>

        <p>It’s breaks pretty reliably along party lines. And then urban is more into the restrictions than rural. And lastly wealthy areas more into than working class. Small or medium sized towns in red states will be your best bet.</p>
