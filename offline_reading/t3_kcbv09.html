    <strong>Idea: Operation Seduction by Symbol</strong>
    <p><h1>The Idea:</h1>
<p>Wear a white hat when you are out and about. Especially in the grocery store, since that seems to have become the #1 public battleground where ideas about the COVID-19 pandemic clash.</p>
<p>This will be our symbol that we support an immediate return to normalcy. </p>
<h1>The Rationale:</h1>
<p>It appears to me that the main reason for people going along with the covid hysteria is virtue-signalling/group-think. Most people do not seem to be afraid (of a virus at-least), when you look at their actions instead of their words. Think about how many people that you know that no longer bother to distance or who are perfectly happy to go out to a restaurant to eat (wearing their mask to the table of course) or who are otherwise hypocrites when it comes to masks and #staying the fuck home. </p>
<p>Imagine what it will do to these people's mindsets if they see one out of five people in their local store wearing a highly visible symbol which shows that they do not agree with the official narrative about the pandemic. Imagine how they will feel if they start to believe that maybe the beliefs they are touting are not so popular among people after-all.</p>
<p>It appears to me that many people who want to speak out are too afraid of fines/public condemnation/losing their jobs to do something like going out without a mask or attending a protest. The great thing about something simple like wearing a normal hat is that despite being highly recognizable and visible it is non-confrontational, and offers a plausible deniability ("I didn't know that it meant anything, I was just wearing my hat"). Also consider that if this fails to take off, nobody will ever know why you decided to wear a white hat but if it does take off then you will have cover from the rest of the group.</p>
<p>The intended outcome is that this bolsters the number of people who support a return to old normal, boosts the confidence of people who already support the cause, and demoralize anybody who might want to attack someone for questioning the official narrative. Then use these numbers and new-found optimism to protest/demonstrate/disobey on a large enough scale to force a return to normal. </p>
<h1>Additional Suggestions:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Take a picture of yourself wearing a white hat and post it to your social media (do not do this if you think that your job could be threatened and you cannot afford to lose your job). </li>
<li>If this idea actually takes off, consider taking your mask off in public if you see that you are surrounded by enough like-minded people (if you are not refusing to wear a mask already).</li>
</ul></p>

<p>I mean, they would, BUT you'd still be complying with the mask mandate, which is 90% of what they care about. They would be ANNOYED but probably not angry enough to get in your face about it, at least until a lot more people were wearing them and becoming a real threat. But by then it's already a great victory, you know?</p>
<p>Very good idea, OP!</p>

        <p>If anyone is very afraid of this, remember that you can rely on your masks to provide a bit of anonymity in a crowd of strangers. I think It will be more effective if people are not anonymous and I don't want anyone to wear a mask but you gotta do what you gotta do to protect yourself.</p>

        <p>Well where I am, we literally HAVE to wear masks or face arrest.  I don't know about you, but I can't afford legal fees for that.  I'm personally a non-mask person, but financial restraints are what they are.</p>

        <p>In Canada where I live I've seen people confronted and grabbed in the grocery store, security guards were stopping her threatening to call police to arrest.  She only made it to the second aisle.  First day the mandate went up.  If you are outside with it in your hand on the way to a store it's fine off (police wise).  Just arrest you for trespassing in buildings.  It's enforced here.  But when I go pick up my kids from school the moms are all mask less which is encouraging, because that is not the vibe or circumstance anywhere else in town.</p>

        <p>This is a brilliant idea! Obviously taking the mask off is the best symbol but we have many allies out there who don't have the option to be one of the first.</p>
<p>So how do we make this known? I guess cross posting to r/lockdownskepticism and maybe r/conspiracy (idk I don't use that one), and try telling people we know are sceptics in real life would be a start. Or post it to social media (not that that's always a good idea) Any ideas?</p>

<p>Please if you are willing. I'm a regular person with no influence network. I've never used social media myself. So please feel free to spread this message however you can. </p>
<p>I was a bit reluctant to cross post to lockdownskepticism given that they don't seem to care so much about activism and the mild anti-mask sentiment in my post. But I'll try that later today anyway, when there are more people online along with r/conspiracy.</p>

        <p>No, no. It has to be an obvious symbol that influences other people. It has to be a shirt or mask off. We can't play around with obscure internet symbolism only a group of 100 people worldwide will get</p>

        <p>I've wanted to do something like this as well but there are problems with this approach.</p>
<ol>
<li>Popularizing a meaningful symbol is just as difficult, if not more so, than popularizing something extremely simple like this. Potentially more difficult because you are going to see alot of disagreement on the exact choice of symbol.</li>
<li>There are logistical issues with getting enough shirts, hats, whatever, made and delivered to people if this is going to be done on a scale large enough to matter. Wearing something simple like an ordinary white hat is very accessible. </li>
<li>Some people are very intimidated by the thought of wearing a confrontational symbol like what you suggest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: In fact I've taken such a serious look at making a symbol that I actually have a local artist working on something for me. After thinking it through though I started losing confidence that it was feasible.</p>

        <p>You're right, it is a good idea although it has to be local and blended with low-level subversion. I always find the nose off works even in strongholds, if the timid people aren't willing to overtly show their feelings it's probably better we occupy places in groups. </p>
<p>What I've seen done well in vancouver BC is blending entertainment with politics at these protest events. The hardcore guys show up and create a space where apolitical people can just tag along, get their social and special event activities, and actually feel like they had a fun time making a statement. I guess if you were a speaker at one of these events and handed out caps and told others what to do it could start a trend.</p>

<p>This is a great idea. Gotta start with places like this first though. If I can't convince the people who already spend too much time on the internet looking at CoronaVirusCircleJerk that this is a good idea I don't have any confidence that I could convince anybody else.</p>

        <p>Best symbol you can show is your smile ☺ fuck the masks, anyone who is wearing one but doesn't agree is part of the problem, hear alot of people saying they'll be arrested if they don't comply, arrested for what exactly??? Know the law know your rights</p>

        <p>I’m not sure where people live who say this. It can be done in some states, others you will be forcibly removed from pretty much everywhere. </p>
