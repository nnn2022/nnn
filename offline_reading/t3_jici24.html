        <p>Can you provide your source that the WHO is saying 10% of people who get the flu die? It seems your mixing ratios here, whereas the flu is expressed as 0.1% and COVID as being decimals.</p>
<p>This is important: there's no need to cheapen our argument with misleading comparisons. IFR for the flu is 0.1%, or 0.001 expressed as a ratio (source below gives that estimate). We'd have to see the age stratification for that as I'm sure, like covid, it is heavily skewed (but towards both younger and older), but even so, we can reasonably say COVID is less dangerous for young people (&lt;20), about the same for middle aged, and more so for the elderly.</p>
<p>Great Barrington Declaration this mess: give options and resources to protect the elderly and vulnerable, and let everyone else get back to normal.</p>

        <p>I don't know. I just made a post trying to clarify the difference because I've seen this mistake on the sub fairly frequently - if not a troll, it only hurts our arguments by being either ignorant of basic statistics or not proof-reading or thinking through the argument. We don't need to misinterpret the data to be in the right here, the data is doing that for us already.</p>

        <p>The one suggesting that 10% of people infected with the flu was another guy, don't ask me for that. </p>
<p>But ok, lets accept for a moment that the CDC people are the stupidest people in the world and they published something to confuse everyone. Just to begin with, if the IFR for the flu is as you are portraying it (0.001 in decimals), then you are reading the CDC data incorrectly. If that is true, that means people &lt;50 years old is 5 times more likely to die from the flu than from the controllavirus, not  &lt;20. By the way, what type of virus only kills very old people and leave children and middle age people almost completely unharmed?.... Specially if we are talking about a virus that travels accross the planet in just a matter of weeks and survives completely opposite weathers and terrains. None sense, there are a few red flags already there. Anyways, lets move on and I'll show you that even in decimals this it doesn't make any sense. </p>
<p>What we really need to take in account is the way they are counting the "covid victims" and how are they testing them. Plus having always in consideration that hospitals get paid every-time they report a case of covid, which naturally creates a conflict of interest. </p>
<p>99% of the people who died in Italy was over 65 years old and they had serious chronic illnesses. Last month the CDC reported that only 6% of the covid victims actually died from the virus itself, when all the rest were elderly people with grave pre-existent conditions. At this point we all know that authorities count as a covid victim to anyone who has died WITH the virus, even if the person died from a completely unrelated cause. This creates a huge inflation of the "covid victims", which explains why there is a 98% reduction in deaths by flu, as well as there are reductions in cancer deaths, hearth diseases, diabetes, and so on. This also explain why the death rate among people over 65 sky</p>
<p>Source 1: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says</a><br>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then we have to analyze the way people gets tested and the seriousness of the tests. I think, a document from the Department of Health of Minnesota clearly shows that the testing procedure is completely flawed, gives false positives and negative, and can't be trusted. Even the inventor of the PCR test said that it should be used for diagnosing due to it's high failability, but they use it anyway. The "Testing Concerns" section in the document says as follows:  </p>
<ul>
<li><em>"Negative results do not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in those who may be presymptomatic or immunocompromised.</em> </li>
<li><em>Positive results may be due to past or present infection with non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains; for example, representing cross-reactivity with other common non-COVID-19 human coronaviruses.</em> </li>
<li><em>Results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection or immunity for occupational or other purposes."</em></li>
</ul>

<p>SO, in summary, even if that 0.001 is decimals, the number and all the contextual elements makes no sense at all. We are in front of the biggest hoax that mankind has ever seen and it's consequences are devastating.</p>

        <p>I agree this is largely overblown, and fully support the Great Barrington Declaration and an end to lockdowns, social distancing, mandatory masks, or any "new normal" peddling. What I'm pointing out is you mixing decimals and percents in your original comment. The CDC IFRs are listed as decimals, not percentages. They stay the same. To compare them to the flu value you need to make sure the flu IFR is also listed as a decimal, not a percentage.</p>
<p>The CDC IFR data is likely close to reality (I suspect the actual IFRs will end up even lower). A recent paper by John Ioannidis supports them. But let's put everything as decimals.</p>
<p>For COVID:
Age range, IFR, proportion</p>
<p>0-19, 0.00003, 1 death per 33000 people infected</p>
<p>20-49, 0.0002, 1 death per 5000 people infected</p>
<p>50-69, 0.005, 1 death per 200 people infected</p>
<p>70+, 0.054, 1 death per 19 people infected</p>
<p>For the flu, average over all ages, with IFR = 0.001:</p>
<p>1 death per 1000 people infected</p>
<p>We can change all the IFRs to percents by multiplying by 100, but the proportion of deaths to infected remains the same.</p>
<p>This is all without even taking into account comorbidities or covid death inflation or any of that: those discussions aren't even really needed because even with the current covid deaths and IFR the comparison to the flu stands: covid is much less deadly than the flu for those under 50, about the same for those 50-70, and more deadly than the flu for those 70+.</p>
<p>Bottom line, though, is be careful to not give the CDC covid IFR as decimals and compare to the WHO flu IFR as a percent (0.1%, instead of 0.001).</p>

        <p>Ok, I don't think the CDC people are that stupid, you do. Fine, we can agree to disagree regarding that point, which is just a technicality. It doesn't change the big picture.</p>
<p>However, I STRONGLY DISAGREE when you say that the controllavirus is more deadly than the flu for those +70. Sure, many people over +70 died, but from unrelated causes to covid19. Authorities just count them as covid victims because they "tested positive", which was a great business for the hospitals, something no one controlled.</p>
<p>Between 50% and 60% of the people that supposedly died from the controllavirus died in nursing homes, with no medical care, no medical equipment, no medical staff, even the resident nursing staff was reduced to the minimum due to the lockdown requirements (some nursing homes with over 300 residents had only 2 nurses to attend them, for all the three shifts). These were all sick people, who lacked of even the minimum care and were completely isolated from their families. They had absolutely no medical treatment of any kind, while hospitals were completely empty. These are the elderly that died from "covid19". They were not killed by a virus, they were murdered, and no one speaks about the nursing homes. Why do you think that is so?</p>

        <p>I am not even discussing other issues with COVID death counts here, just straight up IFR statistics. The CDC is not stupid: their IFR estimates are likely in the ballpark, as backed by John Ioannidis. The flu IFR is likely around 0.1%, or 0.001 as a decimal. When comparing the two you need to keep all IFRs as percentages or decimals, not mix and match.</p>

<p>Edit: For what it's worth, I agree with a lot of the other stuff he said. Just don't think we should incorrectly cite CDC.</p>

        <p>It is true that is a ratio, but it represents the amount of people that die with the infection. Take the crap elsewhere buddy, or explain in full detail what you are trying to say, because it doesn't make any sense.</p>

        <p>I said it in about in about as plain English as it gets. Ratios can be expressed as ratios (0 to 1) or percents (0 to 100). To convert between them you multiply/divide by 100. Either unit is fine, but you can't compare the two without converting. Thus the CDC isn't saying what you claim they say. You might think the CDC is wrong, but that's another matter.</p>

        <p>The CDC posted this model as their "best scenario". So, according to the way YOU like to handle ratios, 10% of the people who get the flu dies?.... Yeah, right. The fact that you cherry-pick the arguments proves how full of crap you are. Buddy, really, get a life and stop wasting my time with this none sense.</p>

        <p>It's not an argument, it's basic math. They used percent to express one and a fraction to express the other. Why? I don't know, as it is admittedly likely to cause confusion. But it's not different than say, using Celsius in one context and Fahrenheit in another. Anyway this clearly isn't useful to debate further, but hopefully people reading this thread get some insight out of it.</p>

        <p>Not buying it. Plus, if what you say is true, the CDC is composed of the stupidest people on earth. By the way, remember to look both ways when you cross the street, you don't want to be hit by a car and become a "covid victim". Also remember #filmyourhospital, now more than ever.</p>

        <p>That's nothing more than fear mongering.</p>
<p>A healthy individual has lower chance to infect a vulnerable person than the other way around. The healthy person will kill off the virus much more readily, the symptoms much milder, so the viral load will be significantly less than those that are vulnerable and are coughing all over the place.</p>
<p>Same crap you are pulling could have been said for the Flu as well. No one locked down or forced masks.</p>
