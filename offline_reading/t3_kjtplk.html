    <strong>Mandatory fines are a way to tax citizens (mostly the poor)</strong>
    <p><p>Mandatory fines for gathering and masks are just another way the government taxes and exploits their poor citizens' earnings. People need to go outside and actually socialize with their friends, community etc. Mandatory fines for people doing something normal, are just another way to tax the citizens, for the cash to get into the money of corrupt politicans.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In my city, we have police officers patroling to watch for gatherings and people not wearing masks, talking about wasted resources! Funnily the police officers NEVER patrol the rich areas, but poor and working class areas! Scumbags.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The rich can be fined again and again without much consequences, but everyone else? Nope. This proves this is a conspiracy by elites and govt to put everyday people down.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1.<a href="http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1517-83822006000300003">Masks decrease in efficiency after 2 hours, being largely ineffective after 4 hours</a></p>
<p>2.To truly become safe from COVID, you need N95 mask, fully airtight as well as lab shades and earbuds to shut off all the holes in your face, which COVID can infect</p>
<ol>
<li>Masks are horrible drain on our environment and contributes to waste.</li>
</ol>
<p>4,There's no evidence that gyms contribute to COVID clutter cases, so why they get lockdowns?</p>
<p>5.Police resources are being wasted on policing citizens gathering and not wearing masks</p>
<p>6.The govts around the world upplay the pandemic, but never mentions that Vitamin D and Zinc helps reduce COVID symptons massively</p>
<p>7.Why are vaccines being pushed? I smell something sinister. I think they contain microscopic RFID chips to track the citizens, otherwise why would they want to push for something potential dangerous and toxic? Considering that</p></p>

<p>1-6 are accurate. 7 is just nonsense.</p>
<p>Pushing the vaccine is more likely about testing the mRNA vaccines on the general populace because no intelligent person would take them if they knew the history of them and the term 'pathogenic priming' that leads to Cytokine Storms in people.</p>

<p>Not quite microscopic, but getting there.  I can see using a larger gauge needle preloaded with these for an innocent vaccination to tag folks without their knowing it.</p>

<p>They don't need that to track people, pretty much every one has a smartphone.</p>

        <p>Yes. And it's mainly a tax on the poor, since the well-off can find ways around the regulations without getting caught.</p>

        <p>We all know they’re not fining rich people. Other taxes on the poor include alcohol tax and cigarette tax. All done in the name of “public health.”</p>

        <p>Specifically to make paupers of dissidents. The western way is to lead the people on with control of the money supply like a pied piper. Oh, bailouts for the elite! too big to fail! Oh, austerity for the poor! That's the free market! Oh! you lose your job and become homeless if you speak out against covid, that's our democracy! But don't worry, you can still be an isolated crank on a street corner broke and censored...</p>
