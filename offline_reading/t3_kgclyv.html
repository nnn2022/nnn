    <strong>The problem with vilifying people who question “the science”</strong>
    <p><p><em>TLDR at the bottom</em></p>
<p>I wonder, when did it become inappropriate to question science? When did questioning popular science, and “experts” become something nefarious? The last I checked, the backbone of the scientific method (and thus, science) is ... just wait for it... asking questions and challenging whatever is assumed to be known already. </p>
<p>This may come as a surprise to some, but science does not equal fact - never has, never will. Science, by its very nature, can never equal fact - in science there is no irrefutable truth. Science does not “prove” anything - instead, science is all about collecting data or evidence that either supports or refutes certain claims. </p>
<p>While most “science” is peer-reviewed and tested via the tried and true scientific method, much of what you see on your TV (that is regarded as science) is bought and paid for (again, don’t fall victim to believing that “peer reviewed” = fact either). </p>
<p>If you are interested in a historical example of this, we can look back to the 1950s - cigarette companies, quite literally,  bought and paid for science that twisted the data in cigarettes and that disputed claims that cigarettes were bad for people. One of the ways in which the tobacco industry tried to change public opinion was by launching a huge media campaign - how did they do this, you may ask? They got celebrities and influential people to endorse their cause. This media campaign effectively changed how people viewed cigarettes, and thus, effectively shaped the entire culture. This is something referred to, by Edward Bernays, as engineered consent. Essentially, what this means is that, via add campaigns and mass media, the society/culture can be shaped. This creates a culture in which people <em>think</em> they are consenting to certain things, but fail to realize that their thoughts, feelings, and actions toward a certain thing (in this case, cigarettes) have been completely engineered by external, bought-and-paid-for sources. </p>
<p>Are the pieces fitting together yet? Can you infer what I am getting at here? The things I have seen people fall for, under the guise of science, is concerning.  I am prepared to be vilified for sharing this, but to be quite frank, I can’t sit back passively anymore - to be quite honest, at this point I am concerned for almost all of humanity. What we are watching unfold right now is unprecedented. I have seen many on my news feeds fall victim to blindly trusting the scientists and experts and taking what they say as both truth and fact (again, something not technically possible under the guise of science). What you see on your news or newsfeed  does NOT = truth. If you still cannot infer what I am getting at, I am talking about the current state of affairs with the pandemic and subsequent roll out of a brand new type of vaccine. </p>
<p>The inconsistency we have seen, since day one, in relation to both pandemic and vaccine is concerning. Normally, inconsistency should breed inquisition, but that is just not the case here. It seems most people have lost any semblance of critical thought, and instead, just follow along doing what they are told. The doctors and scientists who <em>have</em> had the balls to speak out on what is going on have been vilified, doxxed, or have “”””committed suicide””””. </p>
<p>I am not here to deny what is going on. I agree that the virus is a very real thing with the potential to kill those who are immunocompromised. What I am questioning is the almost-immediate mass media campaign we have seen as a result (perhaps akin to what happened in the 50s with cigarettes). The problem here is that you are not allowed to question it - this, of course, is problematic when we consider the very nature of the science most people blindly trust. Not asking questions is counter-intuitive to the actual premise of science. </p>
<p>I personally feel like, since day one, the media has been has been trying to tell us that 1 + 1 = 3. The media is trying to tell us to go against our own, natural intuition and just believe them when they tell us that 1 + 1 = 3. If you choose to question it, you are vilified for trying to get people to remember that 1 + 1 = 2. In this clown world, 1 + 1 = 3. </p>
<p>Tldr; <em>science, by its very nature, does not and cannot ever be equal to fact. The blind following of science is concerning and detrimental to humanity. The media and “science” are trying to tell us that 1 + 1 = 3 and you are crazy if you suggest that 1 + 1 is actually 2.</em></p>
<p>Disclaimer: <em>I initially wrote this as a rant that I was going to post on all of my social media, but then kinda thought what’s the point - I am worried I could be doxxed or lose my career. .. for what it’s worth though, these are just my thoughts</em></p></p>

        <p>Waste of time on your part. Good thing I didn't read, just gonna waste a little bit writing this. It's about saving lives. Whatever way we can manipulate people into saving lives is good. "Trust science" is just one way, basically no believe science = you stoopid, obviously. Don't wanna be that do you</p>

        <p>I imagine it is that for many people. Also this is a bit shaky but I imagine people who would wanna "save lives above all" are the ones skilled at manipulation and shouting matches and twitter combat. Of course they themselves are being manipulated by the true puppet master.</p>
