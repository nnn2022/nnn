    <strong>I am sick, tired and hopeless for our species....</strong>
    <p><p>RANT:   </p>
<p>We live in a time, where propaganda has reached new heights. Its unfathomable to me, how 90% of the people act like Nazis, while accusing the other side of being Nazis. It´s insane. I don’t think anyone will get out of this safely, we lost, we are FUCKED. 90% of your neighbors are happy to snitch on you so the government thugs can invade your home and take away your freedom. I am fucking disappointed of my fellow human brothers and sisters.... It is too much man. What’s wrong with all of you?</p></p>

        <p>I've lost so much faith in humanity the last 18 months.  From the Ruby Freemans working election night, to the flight attendants kicking 2-year-olds off of flights for mask compliance, I've come to the conclusion that there are far more shitty people in the world than I thought.  I used to think the USA was a country of laws, but I can see now that it's not.  </p>
<p>To me, it boils down to lack of values combined with zero personal responsibility, and lack of consequences for shitty behavior.  On another thread a few days ago, we we talking about how people will behave in a real crisis...like what if there was a widespread electrical blackout, or supply chain disruption.</p>
<p>My favorite quote was one guy who said, "people will kill you for a bag of fucking Doritos."</p>

Bcs once we are the 2 of us, it will be easier to build a future for our kids to be worth living in. Lets not divide. Fuck your party, fuck my party, lets build a future for our children worth living in.</p>

        <p>Allow me to correct you. </p>
<p>90% of the people <em>speaking</em> are acting like Nazis, but don’t make the mistake of thinking that they’re the majority, they’re not. </p>
<p>If you have children, make sure you educate them on how important freedom is. Teach them history so they know the dangers of losing that freedom (American Revolutionary War, the Holocaust, things like that) and also teach them how to take care of themselves. I’m lucky enough that I slowly accumulated things for my garage gym over the years so I can be somewhat self-sufficient in that area, but another advantage to that is you can teach your children about the importance (and fun) of exercising and staying healthy. </p>
<p>Lastly, another important thing, is own guns and know how to use them. Teach your children how to use them, you can start with airsoft guns. Make it fun and they’ll learn even faster. Remember that you’re shaping the future with them, and because of them the future will be brighter. </p>
<p>Sorry if I sound preachy.</p>

        <p>Here in the good old United Snakes of America:</p>
<p>The "right" is propagandized to the point of vomiting out the most irrational and dumb fucking bullshit imaginable just because that bullshit is the opposite of whatever the "left" believes.</p>
<p>The "left" is propagandized to the point of vomiting out the most irrational and dumb fucking bullshit imaginable just because that bullshit is the opposite of whatever the "right" believes.</p>
<p>Both "sides" LITERALLY, not figuratively, but LITERALLY believe that the "other side" is EVIL. And that makes both "sides" complete shit.</p>
<p>You might THINK you are immune to propaganda, you might THINK that your beliefs about freedom or politics or social issues are just what you naturally and intrinsically believe, but they aren't.</p>
<p>Also, can we put a moratorium on calling everything we don't believe in "Nazism?" Please?</p>
