<p>EDIT: to shed some light on the first link, they do not specifically talk about face masks being the driver of these endogenous infections, however they did not study that assessment. Any microbiologist can confirm you that masks become sort of petri dishes after a certain amount of time wearing them, and I guarantee you that most of the population wont change masks every 4 hours.</p></p>

        <p>As I said, they didn't even bother to study that assessment. But hey, here's something for you if you don't think bacteria accumulates in masks:</p>

        <p>And you really believe most people use masks for that amount of time? I've heard of many people using the same mask for a month; and even if you tell them this info they do not care, they only use masks because it's mandatory.</p>
<p>Edit: the solution is to end the mask mandates, since using them in this fashion is pretty unsustainable.</p>

        <p>Have any case studies of these people that wear the same mask for a month developing bacterial pneumonia? How about numbers suggesting that isolated bacterial pneumonia cases have risen this year compared to last year? Or any kind of paper remotely relevant to bacterial pneumonia? </p>
<p>If you understood " microbiology, pathophysiology, pulmonology, etc. " you'd understand that covid-19 is the risk factor driving secondary bacterial infections in any case. Not only that, the paper you linked presents the most likely source of bacterial inoculation into the lower respiratory tract as intubating someone. In case you're unaware this involves placing a tube inside their mouth (seeding it with oral bacteria) and shoving it down their trachea.</p>
<p>To make the search easier for you I found this paper that is probably the most relevant to the point you're trying to make, but even then doesn't support your conclusion. They found more bacteria in the air than on the inside and outside of surgical masks combined. To avoid misrepresenting the data they obviously are following health professionals here demonstrating correct mask usage, though they never define the length of time that constitutes a "used mask". The second paper demonstrates a similar finding with dental professionals that admit to reusing their masks for multiple encounters, though they also do not define how long constitutes a used mask. Maybe you can use the methods in these two studies and collect used masks from all your patients and assess the bacterial load on the inside and outside of them in your laboratory.</p>
<p>Interested to see how you spin the interpretation with your superior knowledge of microbiology, pathophysiology, and pulmonology.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4202234/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4202234/</a></p>
<p>"The present study found that both bacterial and fungal contamination on outside areas of the used masks were significantly higher than the inside areas (166 ± 199 <em>vs.</em> 47 ± 56 cfu/ml/piece, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001 and 34 ± 18 <em>vs.</em> 15 ± 9 cfu/ml/piece, <em>p</em>&lt;0.001; respectively). "</p>
<p>"The microbial indoor air quality assessment in this present study revealed that OPD had the highest average of bacterial and fungal counts (576 ± 254 cfu/m3 and 263 ± 219 cfu/m3), while ICU and OR had the lowest average of bacterial count and fungal count, respectively. "</p>

        <p>Unless you can pull up a study showing evidence of increased isolated bacterial pneumonia occurring because of masks there really isn't anything new to argue. The most common cause of lobar pneumonia is a commensal bacteria in the respiratory tract. Covid or any other means of immune disruption puts people at risk for bacterial pneumonia. We wear the masks to help prevent people from getting covid, if they already get covid they could co-contract bacterial pneumonia from bacteria that already reside in their upper airway regardless of how much exponential growth is happening in their mask. All of that is also assuming the person in question is wearing the same soiled mask for weeks or months. If anything covid and stress are a greater modulator of dysbiosis from everything I have read.</p>
<p>Your paper argues that masks do not help prevent the transmission of viruses, but there is good evidence they do. I had to click through 3 referenced papers to get to the one that they were all talking about, and they only demonstrate the lack of efficacy of cloth masks. They even say surgical masks reduce particle emission by 56%, which is a worst case. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577.long</p>
<p>Not to mention the paper you linked tries to use decreased PaO2 as a reason not to wear surgical masks, which to me is grounds to just throw this out altogether. If your argument is the mask can't stop a virus how can it stop diatomic oxygen? Grasping at straws there.</p>
<p>This paper demonstrates that surgical masks and k95s reduce particle emission while speaking and coughing by 90% and 74% respectively: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7</p>
<p>The mask is a filtering apparatus that could hopefully (coupled with distancing) allow us to go about vaguely normal activities like shopping, exercising, socializing while minimizing the risks as much as we can.</p>
<p>In short I've seen no evidence anywhere despite searching for hours that bacterial pneumonia is on the rise and have seen plenty of proof of concepts that surgical masks can reduce viral emissions from people. The people that I'd be most worried about are pre-symptomatic people, who obviously have a lower viral load and are already less transmissible than symptomatic people, so wearing a mask further decreases their viral emission potential allowing us more leeway to go about a normal life.</p>
