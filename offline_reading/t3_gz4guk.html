    <strong>What have you done since your state partially opened if it did?</strong>
    <p><p>What places have you gone to? How horrible was it? Masked haircuts? Waiting in line for hours to do a simple thing? Did it feel worth it? </p>
<p>Governors and doomers are saying we are reopening so stop complaining so I thought it would be interesting to talk about what reopening actually looks Like.</p></p>

        <p>Right after the restaurants could open with very limited capacities, the riots started and curfews were imposed. So, Walmarts have even shorter hours now in the Denver metro areas I've seen. I tried to buy dog food twice this weekend, on Saturday around 7:30pm and yesterday before 5pm, but each time the respective Walmart was already closed. I did venture out to Target, which didn't seem to have the same limited hours. </p>
<p>Red Robin is taking "reservations," but when I called on Sunday, they weren't busy and told me that as long as I call about 20 minutes beforehand, they should be able to save me a table.</p>
<p>What really infuriates me is that places like Waterton Canyon, that are open areas for hiking, are still closed indefinitely. They had increased use at the beginning of the lockdowns, but apparently, we really shouldn't use our parks and open spaces per the government. Also, I like many other Coloradoans don't have air conditioning in my 1950s-built house, and while working in an air conditioned office during the day would have allowed me to avoid the hottest hours of a day, there are currently no places with air conditioning to spend hot afternoons. Though strip clubs were allowed to open, we can't have people sit in a movie theater or library. </p>
<p>The outdoor mall near my home also removed benches. So, while the frozen yogurt shop struggles to get customers in the door and move them through, six feet apart at all times, there's no place to actually enjoy frozen yogurt in or outside of the shop. Most of the other stores just remain closed.</p>
<p>I'm also concerned that now that some places are "open," there will be less push to actually return to reasonable levels of use of spaces. Fifty people in a 24 Hour Fitness Sport gym is not sustainable for the business, and it's really ridiculous given how large such a facility is.</p>

        <p>Having the frozen yogurt shop open, but no outdoor benches to sit on and enjoy it, reminds me of what's going on in my county. Food trucks have been operating this whole time, but food trucks around here used to put out a couple of folding tables so customers could sit down. Not anymore--either they're not allowed to, or they're too cautious to put the tables out. What's really dumb is that restaurants with patios are allowed to do outdoor dining, so food trucks should be able to set up their dang tables...</p>

        <p>I’ve gone to the hair salon and esthetician. Really no difference except wearing a mask. It felt so nice to get back to my normal routine. </p>
<p>I have continued online shopping/Instacart partly because it saves me time, but mostly because I don’t want to deal with the one way aisles and socially distanced checkout lines.</p>

        <p>I booked a haircut appointment but canceled it when I saw all the silly rules they had. I had a dentist appointment that I booked for May way back in December. Luckily they opened just in time. They also had silly rules but I didn't want to pay the cancelation fee so I did everything begrudgingly.</p>
<p>I went tubing this weekend with a crowd of thousands of unmasked people. Nobody seemed to worry about the virus at all. That's the biggest shot of normality I've had in a while.</p>

        <p>I am lucky to live in Florida (I know, insert Florida joke here...), so I’ve enjoyed dining out, going to the beach and gym, and generally it is getting back to normal. Many stores, although allowed to operate at full capacity, are choosing to still impose silly rules like “appointment only” shopping. I don’t play their games, but I am happy to see things getting back to normal. I do not enjoy wearing a mask, but if the difference is being closed or being open with a mask, I’ll take the latter. I’m anxiously awaiting Disney world to reopen, but I know they will have dumb policies. I’m just hoping that once things open throughout the US more people will feel normal returning and there will be a push to truly get back to normal...not this BS “new normal”.</p>

        <p>FL here too. Done lots of dining out, beach. I keep attempting to take my kid to the playgrounds but first our county hadn’t opened them yet and then I saw they did but when I showed up to the one by my place I discovered it was only open to day campers since it’s attached to a rec center. Even though No day campers were using at the time. In fact the day camp lady was sitting outside since they had no kids.</p>
<p>One day, playground, one day.</p>

        <p>I got to play gamble but it kinda sucks when the dealers are wearing thick gloves and wearing masks. I expect gamers are not going to appreciate the over sanitation and so much social distancing and having half the slots still off.</p>

        <p>Went to one in Vegas this weekend. Was a bit weird but not that bad. They do temperature checks on the way in which make no sense in a desert where it gets up to 120 degrees outside. Don't see that lasting. Some people were reading around 102 just from being outside and having to wait around the entrances in the ac to cool down.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, very few guests were wearing masks and few were worrying about social distancing, especially around the bars. Rule in Nevada is you can sit at a bar, but you can't walk up to one and order. Apparently corona only gets you if you are standing at the bar.</p>

        <p>I live in Los Angeles, so on the day they opened the beaches, I took a three hour walk along my (small, local) beach. I'm in a more conservative part of the county, so I knew every major news outlet would be faking shots of science-haters swarming the beach to kill granny. I was correct: they even brought zoom lenses and special equipment to make the sparsely populated (everyone here is still mostly scared to leave their homes) beach look packed. The only SURGE at that beach was cameramen, not covid! Movie magic!</p>

        <p>I went to a restaurant with my husband and toddler today. We had a really nice time. The staff wore masks and the seating was socially distant but other than that it was pretty normal. It definitely cheered me up too. I guess I didn’t realize how much I took for granted the simple freedoms we had until they were taken away.</p>

        <p>I'm in Texas (DFW) and haven't done a ton so far. I did get brunch and hang out at a friend's apartment with some others for his birthday and that was nice. It felt weird walking in to the restaurant but once we were seated and the chips &amp; salsa started coming out, all was well. Pulling up the menu on the phone was odd but that's whatever to me. Quite frankly I liked that it wasn't <em>too</em> busy at the restaurant, not necessarily because of rona but because I don't like loud places that aren't concert venues or bars.</p>
<p>Not a whole lot besides that. Took motorcycle training which was fun, going to the DMV tomorrow which will either be nice (by appointment only) or awful (if they're understaffed). My favorite watering hole opened back up and I'll probably go there this weekend. The increasing cases do give me a bit of pause, but the statement from the WHO today that asymptomatic spread seems incredibly unlikely also tempers that.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah: good chance I go on a date this week.</p>

        <p>I have gone out to eat a lot, no lines yet, people are still scared.  One place required reservations.</p>
<p>Haircut scheduled for the 18th (25 percent capacity means my salon can only have one stylist at a time, argh).  Pedicure - got a same day appointment but had to wait in my car til my appointment time, wear a muzzle, and sign a waiver after a temp check.</p>
<p>Been to the gym.  Fortunately mine rarely exceeds half capacity. Aside from every other treadmill being taped off, it's been pretty normal - except of course for all the police and SWAT vehicles that circled the night after we had riots.</p>
<p>Shopping of all kinds still feels dystopian.  With 25 percent capacity allowed, there is a mix of metering, closed stores, and by appointment only shopping.  It's not fun, and you can't even try on clothes in some stores.</p>

        <p>I've been to restaurants and casinos. The restaurants here are still patio only, which is fine if it's nice out.</p>
<p>The casinos here are tribal, so the "rules" vary. Each one I've been to has done temperature checks, and usually every other slot machine is turned off. Chairs are removed too from the empty ones. Kind of sucks because my husband and I like to play video poker together, just taking turns playing. Now we have to take turns standing.</p>
<p>I will not be getting a haircut until I don't have to wear a mask.</p>

        <p>I got one yesterday because it was bothering me not to be able to. The haircut itself was unpleasant which I anticipated. I can’t get my bangs trimmed between appointments right now: that’s too dangerous I guess.</p>

        <p>I've been to the mall, gone out to eat several places, went to listen to some local music, gotten my hair cut, gone to a brewery for a flight, went to a few antique shops.  It's honestly not as bad here (NH) as other places.  I haven't had to wait to get in anywhere and most places are pretty normal once you're in. There's been a few places that haven't enforced social distancing at all and mask use here is pretty split.  They're required in restaurants when walking to/from the restroom but nobody wears them when they're sitting down. (Except my visiting cousins from MA who were absolutely shocked at the lack of masks here) Individual stores can require them but it's not a state mandate.  Basically, I've found that bigger box stores/restaurants are going to really push the new dystopian normal but most smaller, locally owned businesses just rely on people to social distance themselves.   That all said, I won't be happy until things are 100% back to normal but that's not going to happen without people going out as normal and pushing back against the "new normal"</p>
