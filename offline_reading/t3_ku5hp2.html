    <strong>The new commie capital of North America</strong>
    <p><p>I would just like to point out that today, January 9th 2021, the province of Quebec, Canada has imposed a 8 PM daily curfew for 28 days *minimum* on top of a full lockdown with no protest. </p>
<p>The reason for this is.... brace yourself....... <strong>30-50 daily deaths</strong> and \~200 in intensive care. <strong>For the whole province</strong>. This is of course mostly elderly people from retirement homes, abandoned by the same "if saves one life" fear-mongering cultists. </p>
<p>Yet they test more and more people and treat the mUch TeRrIfFfIyInG InCrEaSe In CaSeS as their main indicator. I hear things are not much different in Ontario but this curfew is next level. Even got an emergency alert on my phone and everything.</p>
<p>I hereby declare this part of Canada the new sheeple capital of North America and will be making plans to move to Florida by May 1st, 2021. Praise this sub and have a good evening.</p>
<p>FEAR THE GREAT DEADLY VIRUS! SUCH TERROR! MUCH DEATH! /s</p></p>

        <p>It might sounds backwards but these extreme measures are helping us who are anti-lockdown.</p>
<p>I've finally seen Canadians in other subs start to see the light and agree curfews are too much and a useless measure. </p>
<p>The government are digging their own grave with these reckless mandates.</p>

        <p>Bingo, that's pretty much what I've been saying, and I've noticed the same thing at you. Especially when they put forth things that make absolutely no sense, even to domiest sooner (like a curfew). Even if you look at something like CP24 here in Toronto, I'd say we're now about split in terms of attitudes in the Twitter threads, whereas a few months ago it was overwhelmingly in favor of further measures.</p>

        <p>They are using helicopters to patrol, and have squad cars blaring sirens with lights on. This isn't about a virus, it's about fear and intimidation. This is all a psyop. I'm predicting the next step will be the "dark winter".</p>

        <p>The word is that there's very likely going to be a curfew put into effect in the coming week.  Deferring from previous advice, I actually encourage you to go r/Ontario right now and find the post about it.  The comments are actually giving me some hope.</p>

        <p>I said as much above, but we're seeing these measures backfire more and more. Sure, it might feel a bit like a grain of sand an hourglass right now, but every little grain adds up. </p>
<p>I've been reading through Twitter thread on CP24 here in Toronto and whereas a couple of months ago all of the most liked comments were in favor of further measures, I'd say now you're seeing a good split between for and against. Even the people who think more needs to be done are saying that this is not the right direction and that a targeted approach is better (aka protect the long-term care homes).</p>

        <p>People are saying they are willing to join the Hugs Over Masks protests even though they fucking hate those guys XD.  Or they said they're looking for middle of the line resistance.</p>
<p>Dude I'm so fucking scared.  Most people in my life are trying to get through this by continuing on with the 'it's temporary we have to do it' and/or are too busy with their own stuff to give it any real attention and I don't want to be burden them with my apprehensions.  But I feel so alone and scared, like I'm watching this happen and there's nothing I can do.</p>
<p>Had to vent that last part.  Just woke up (from actual sleep lol)</p>

        <p>I hear you, believe me I've woken up from enough nightmares about this stuff. </p>
<p>My best advice for personal mental health is to focus on yourself as much as possible. Do things that make you happy. Set a workout challenge for yourself that's all using your body, no need for any gyms or equipment; watch movies you've wanted to watch, a lot of classic films have a lot of wisdom in them. The same goes for books. </p>
<p>On a larger scale - people are going to get fed up eventually, just remember that. The only question is how long will it take? What we're living through is absolutely miniscule in the context of greater human history, so rest assured that in the cosmic sense we will get through all of this. That might not be comforting, but it should be - it's just a reminder that we're not all powerful and not all knowing.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is take care of yourself first. If you are strong, then you can lend your strength to those around you. If they wish, they will follow you and listen to you. Beyond that, let the course of events guide you. We have not had a nucleating incident yet, one that forces everybody to stop and think about their place in this world in the context of all of this madness. It may yet come, but if it doesn't, those around you will rely on your strength. </p>
<p>Hang in there, I feel very much the same.</p>

        <p>Thanks.  I guess part of the issue is too that this is real, people are getting sick and it does seem to be particularly bad in some places. But those places also happen to be where the most draconian measures are.  What came first the chicken or the egg and does locking down and applying heavy restrictions actually make things better or worse.  If there's evidence it's making it worse, why are other governments following suit like Ontario.  Can't wait to hear what's happening on Tuesday /s.  Better get my 'justify your existence' papers in order</p>

        <p>You're right, It's very real for a lot of people. But we know who those people are - every piece of data points to elderly people and especially ones with multiple other comorbidities. If they wanted to make it better, they had 10 months to apply targeted measures to LTC homes, but they still can't get that right (or don't want to). </p>
<p>If you look at a bunch of graphs that have been posted here, it's becoming evident that the virus patterns have been the same all across the hemisphere regardless of differences in measures. but of course people don't understand that and they keep screaming for the government to do something, so of course the government will respond.</p>
