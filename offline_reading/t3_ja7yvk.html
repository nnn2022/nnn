    <strong>Is anyone else living with their parents considering moving out over disagreements regarding what level of precautions to take?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone!! I’m a 22 year guy suffering through months of quarantining with doomer parents and I could really use some advice.</p>
<p>My parents were already big germaphobes pre-pandemic but I tolerated it because I was still able to go out and live my life without interference until Mid-March when the virus hit.</p>
<p>Now, with the fact that they’re over 60 and in an at-risk group, they want the entire family to make several of these “guidelines” a permanent part of our lives, even after this is over. They also believe that if
we don’t, we’re deliberating trying to endanger the family. I obviously know it’s their house, their rules, and I should feel grateful I made it seven months without catching Covid, but at the same time, I can’t live with this cascade of doomerism and ultimatums for years. </p>
<p>I am so lost and not sure what to do. I want to find work and move out but I feel guilty about looking when I still have a house and food on the table, while other people are barely getting by and living off their savings. </p>
<p>Should I get a job and move out or swallow my pride and follow their lead? What’s the best way to handle this situation respectfully? What would you personally do?</p></p>

        <p>I would get a job and move out.  This is no way to live.  I would do it now, because when the various unemployment programs run out, you are going to have a lot more competition.</p>

        <p>Sorry why aren’t you working anyways? But yes you should move out if you can’t be a normal person. I say this as someone who lived with their parents until I got married.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty much your age and this has crossed my mind. </p>
<p>My parents arent the absolute worst, they're just followers who do whatever the tv say and dont do their own research.  So I sometimes have to explain things to them (not just covid things, it's hilarious how little they know about or how much they misunderstand about  for example the american election) and those explanations dont always end well.   </p>
<p>My parents are a bit younger than yours and while they arent complete doomers they're more in the camp of "i really really  dont wanna offend people so I'm gonna be a good obedient person even though maybe i'm not sure this is all okay"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I just got a job and while it doesnt pay too great i'm getting on my way. I was planning to move out at some point soon anyway so i guess this is as good a time as any</p>

        <p>Yep my Grandparents are full on doomers who consime copious amounts of MSNBC propaganda. This shit seems to have changed them to become more misanthropic. Anyway, that is just one reason I want to get out.</p>
<p>EDIT: But even they don’t want to make this permanent. Holy shit and these same people call US selfish. Yeah-move out yesterday.</p>

        <p>My grandmother is actually a lot more optimistic and thinks we’ll be back to pre-Covid normal by the last third of next year, while my dad basically gets annoyed if I say anything even remotely optimistic about the situation. He takes any news headline  that suggests the guidelines being permanent as gospel, while he thinks anyone saying something even cautiously optimistic are only doing so because Trump paid them or because the drug companies want to make a quick buck. </p>
<p>I’m gonna respect these rules till I can move out, since I have no interest in seeing them get sick, and since I’m still not paying rent, they are fully entitled to kick me out if I don’t play by their rules.</p>

        <p>I agree with everyone here. I'd move out and in the future I would be skeptical of your parents for whether or not they are in on the plandemic with the libtards. I'd never talk to my parents again if they behaved like yours. Do not give up your freedoms, even if it means your parents have to die from covid.  Sorry, not going to put on a mask to save anybody.</p>

        <p>I've been getting mask pressure from my parents too, they keep saying i'm going to be fined, 3 months and nothing yet, i've been considering pranking them with a fake fine notice of 15,000 GBP for wearing a mask in a bank, aimed at my dad</p>
