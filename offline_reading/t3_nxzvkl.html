        <p>It sucks that this is now so controversial of an opinion to hold. Like, even removing politics from this, what is so wrong with thinking critically and looking at hard data that shows that masks for everyone, vaccinations for children or months and months of endless restrictions and lockdowns maybe aren't the answer? It just seems like everything nowadays is mandated by what makes people <em>feel</em> good and not what is actually what is best for both individuals and society at large. You cant even express opposition to lockdowns in public without the government and media labelling you basically a heartless criminal who should care more about what feels nice than what is objectively true when looking at data and evidence. Now we are all guilty of being a vector of disease and death when you are likely absolutely healthy and aren't killing anyone by not wearing masks. I guess common sense no longer applies in this reality.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns have several harmful side effects, this goes without question. What we have to sacrifice for less COVID casualties and how best to manage it is a perfectly legitimate public debate that should be held. There are several hard ethical questions which we should think about, and also the science on how best to manage the pandemic evolves and not at all complete  and how best to translate this into policy for the least deaths for the least secondary suffering is also a really hard discussion.</p>
<p>However, in order to even have a basic discussion people should be able to agree on some basic facts:</p>
<p>-Corona is a real and serious world-wide problem. It's not some random conspiracy to from the democrat party or whatever. People all over the world really die of it and they are not just a huge number of crisis actors now all hiding somewhere.</p>
<p>-Science doesn't know everything and isn't perfect (and very importantly, also doesn't pretend to be) but it's the best we have. We can't just trust the first the best internet rando who tells us what to believe, the advice of health agencies based on dozens of independent studies is worth more in comparison. </p>
<p>-Vaccines are the greatest success of medical history with a great track-record of safety compared to other medicines and the current vaccines are probably the most meticulously tested ever and the most trustworthy they have ever been. It has been proven now with AZ and that side effects so rare that they can only be detected during stage four testing (after roll=out), that health agencies do their job they are supposed to do: research it communicate it honestly. Even while this risk is much smaller than what corona poses some countries stopped with it and this exaggerated reactions show that safety is taken very seriously in the western world and that you can be very sure taking your shot.</p>

        <p>The fact that you used a non-emotional argument, didn’t question the motives of those with opposing views, didn’t make bold assertions, or repeated any slogans and used reason and logic to make your argument…and then we’re downvoted by the people repeating slogans, questioning motives, making bold assertions and being very emotional… you perfectly proved the OP right, however not likely in the way they were thinking.

        <p>I remember some years ago there was uproar online because some kid at school had to try act like a 17th century slave owner and justify slavery in a letter to friend or something.</p>
<p>A great way to show people how different arguments can be used for different sides of the debate and how people can justify even the slavery of they have personal gains. Extremely useful exercise for all ages in my opinion. You don’t have to agree or promote certain view to understand motives.</p>

        <p>This was clear when I first went to law school.  Every other student had been some sort of poli-sci /pre law undergraduate and had no idea what an argument even was.  No sense of logic, structure, antecedent, conclusion, no reason at all.  Instead they had watched episodes of ally mcbeal and wanted to go into law so they could get a good, prestigious job that didnt require any math and as a bonus, let them boss people around.</p>
<p>These are the people that are now middle/senior managers in all of these govt organisations.</p>

        <p>Allow me to play the skeptic ...</p>
<p>I’ve taken a look at his tweets over the years, and have noticed some patterns:</p>
<p>He proclaims a lot, makes statement that sound like they make sense but don’t stand scrutiny. </p>
<p>He seems to be only popular with conservatives and Jordan Peterson fans, who quote him seemingly as a way to ‘own’ the libs. </p>
<p>I’ve never seen him offer any solution to today’s issues other than maintaining the status quo while calling people dumb and lazy. </p>
<p>This is what I’m seeing - I’m open to changing my mind, but I don’t see him as an intellectual. Simply a useful tool for the right.</p>

        <p>Most intellectuals are at least somewhat partisan, some very. That doesn’t change their status as intellectuals.</p>
<p>I’m not a fan of leftists myself, but that wasn’t my point. My point was that he says things that leftists do not like, so by default they would not be a fan of his.</p>
<p>Here is what I deem to be a great video of his: https://youtu.be/ZoOH8Q5VAcI</p>
<p>It’s a fantastic video (give it a chance) and if that’s too partisan for you I can link you another. Seriously, I’d hear him out, it’s insightful.</p>

        <p>Like in the very beginning, when they said 'natural immunity doesn't exist'.</p>
<p>Unthinking person:  "OH SHITOHSHITOHSHIT we NEED to shutdown averything and wait for the vaccine!"</p>
<p>Person with a modicum of critical thinking ability: "Well, that's bogus, if natural antibodies doesn't happen, how is anyone getting better?"</p>
<p>Fast forward a year, and no re-examination of this has been done by the unthinking. They just excuse this obvious lapse in reason by 'well they didn't know for sure, there were no sTuDies'.</p>
<p>Another example is when they use some method of analysis to determine that the virus was present long before the pandemic was declared, in some places for months, to no catastrophic effect, and the unthinking are shocked. Meanwhile the critically thinking understand that OBVIOUSLY a virus has to be there BEFORE the eXpeRts can detect it, and there WILL be a gap in between when it's there to detect and when they manage to do it.</p>

        <p>The initial data suggested that after six months the amount of antibodies an average person would have wouldnt be sufficient to keep them out of hospital. It was also theorized, without an official shutdown the cases would reach such a significant number that people would go into a shut down of the own accord. As well as the hospitals being beyond operating capacity. I can't help but think you're misrepresenting the opposing arguments.</p>

        <p>&rt; The initial data suggested that after six months the amount of antibodies an average person would have wouldnt be sufficient to keep them out of hospital. </p>
<p>Because the entire epidemiology community somehow forgot that antibodies can dissipate while the body retain the memory of how to make them if it needs them.</p>
<p>And of course, more current data have disproved this completely. People are not getting re-hospitalized  over and over. </p>
<p>&rt;It was also theorized, without an official shutdown the cases would reach such a significant number that people would go into a shut down of the own accord</p>
<p>Which is irrelevant. Yes, if it really was the plague the doomsayers said it was, people would make the rational choice. They were prevented from doing this , though. </p>
<p>&rt;As well as the hospitals being beyond operating capacity.</p>
<p>Pretty much happened nowhere.. I guess except places where the science fans moved patients to nursing homes and spread it around.</p>

        <p>How do you account for India? Where hospitals exceeded capacity, people with other conditions that needed medical treatment werent able to be treated. Where people were throwing their dead relatives into the ganges and dogs would feast on the washed up corpses miles away?</p>

        <p>&rt;How do you account for India?</p>
<p>By directing you to the stats https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. India is not even in the top 100 countries for deaths per million. </p>
<p>A tiny percentage of Indians dying can look to the western viewer as a disaster because there are so many of them.</p>
<p>&rt;Where people were throwing their dead relatives into the ganges </p>
<p>This was always a thing in India. The Ganges is one of the most shitted up rivers in the world because of the traditions over there. </p>
<p>Basically, you bought into a bunch of dumb hysteria from a press that uses your fear for ad revenue clicks.</p>

        <p>Are you trying to say that their  hospitals weren't beyond capacity? And that they werent in dire need of oxygen, and that many Europeans nations didnt supply them with oxygen plants?

        <p>You are kind of proving the OP right though, just not how they intended. Someone makes a coherent argument, you respond with a very broad, sweeping statement about how they are bending the numbers to suit their objective. Not realising that your very argument hinges on you doing almost exactly that, discrediting the data that doesn't suit yours.</p>
<p>Not exactly coherent now, is it?</p>

        <p>In the early 20th century, the wealthiest people in the world realized that Reason and teaching the ability to Reason properly to the masses was the only threat to their collective power. Hence the birth of mass propaganda machines, media conglomerates, collectivism and the removal of Philosophy, Logic and Reason from public education systems.</p>

        <p>This is true. Began under the Wilson admin. Industry was frustrated with a qork force that could make a coherent argument, convince others and collectively fight for better standards. </p>
<p>The 19th century expansion of the US required educated problem solving people to make something out of the territories. You had to be able to read, do math, use new technology, problem solve, keep records etc etc.</p>
<p>The early laborers in the factories had benefited from this education system and were capable of voicing with reason their plight.</p>
<p>Industry response was, we need these people stupid.</p>

        <p>Science is shitty now, too. Turns out that in order for experimentation and statistics to have any value, you need to first use logic and reason to form a reasonable hypothesis to confirm. If you don't have a reasonable hypothesis that's likely to be confirmed, you WILL twist data to suit whatever shitty illogical one you had, just to have a positive, publishable result.</p>

        <p>If science is being practiced, why does an untested vaccine get emergency use authorization, but potential treatments that are known to be safe aren't allowed to be tried?</p>
<p>It's not a consensus of the community. It's the narrative of its leaders. The community goes along because those leaders are powerful, and rocking the boat threatens careers. There's little potential benefit and lots of downside to going against them.</p>
<p>Is what gets published in journals consensus or the narrative of their editors?</p>
<p>Is what gets funded consensus or the decision of a small group of bureaucrats?</p>
<p>Scientists are not free to practice true science because they're beholden to the reality of the bureaucracy and its politics.</p>
<p>You're not following science. You're placing faith in the same human beings that err and are corrupted in all other parts of life. They aren't superheroes from a comic book.</p>

        <p>Actually it is the consensus of the community. Your fringe elements are just that, a few fringe elements who lack the evidence for their claims unlike the consensus of the scientific community. If they had the evidence to strongly support their claims that is reproducible and reliable, scientists everywhere would accept it - but they simply haven’t presented this evidence.  You’re deluding yourself into think there is this massive divide and debate in science on masks, vaccines, etc. when there plainly isn’t. </p>
<p>Tell me, if we got rid of all the scientists because experts can’t be trusted, would be that be better for society? Should we have no specialists who are experts in their field who we can defer to for guidance and insignt?</p>
<p>I’m a scientist doing genetics research and bureaucracy hasn’t ever held back my research - money, time, and technological limitations have. And funding decisions need to be made, we can’t equally fund everything so yes we have subgroups of committees at various level dictate the distribution of grants and awards and contracts alongside private/public companies. I don’t see an organized funding system being malicious, it’s the only realistic system</p>

<p>The vast majority of black people will never have their rights abused by cops. That doesn't mean it doesn't happen. A good scientist should know a personal anecdote isn't proof of anything.</p>
<p>In this climate of censorship and demonization of people who counter the official narrative, what scientist in their right mind would pick a fight with the CDC and the WHO?</p>
<p>Again, if science is being practiced, why does an untested vaccine get emergency authorization while treatments using established and safe medicines are held to a far higher standard?</p>
<p>Is it because the people who make those decisions are hoping to get jobs at pharma companies they would piss off if they did so?</p>

        <p>So do you have then a study with data to support your claim that funding decisions are a massive issue in the scientific community? I can see in some specific fields perhaps but you gotta provide evidence for your claims. I gave my anecdote to show that your claim isn’t a guarantee.</p>
<p>I mean the people countering that human climate change isn’t a thing don’t have the data to back that up lol. It’s all about evidence and how you present it, but these climate change deniers don’t have the evidence whereas there is enormous evidence for manmade climate change. </p>
<p>Your delusion is thinking the vaccines were untested when numerous studies and large, thorough clinical trials were conducted. That’s why they were granted authorization because they were no longer untested and they were proven safe and effective. </p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of proported medical treatments for covid19 either have little to no impacr on the disease course or are even harmful. Pretty much the only really effective intervention found was in the RECOVERY trial with dexamethasone - which fyi is now the standard of care for serious covid-19 cases. In fact it is counterproductive to the pharma companies to invest so much into these vaccines instead of just selling their current medical interventions if they actually worked for covid19.</p>

<p>&rt;That’s why they were granted authorization because they were no longer untested and they were proven safe and effective.</p>
<p>This is a lie. They have an <strong>emergency</strong> authorization because they have not been proven safe. Their trials have been limited, short and not nearly as rigorous as normal for vaccines, let alone ones using new technology that has never been successfully tested on animals.</p>
<p>You probably didn't know mRNA has never had a successful animal trial, did you?</p>

        <p>actually no I’m in the process of getting my PhD but my lab is extremely collaborative so I’ve gotten insights into plenty of fields - definitely far from the full spectrum but a healthy amount of exposure. My lab is also translational research for therapies so actually meshing our work with data from “the real world” is critical to my research; whatever “the real world” means.</p>
<p>Honestly you’re just too cynical of a person. Corruption is always a problem but it doesn’t rule every system that exists. </p>
<p>LOL wtf, you have 0 idea what an EUA entails and are simply going off of the title of it without reading into the substance. An EUA requires virtually the same testing, safety, efficacy, and review requirements as full FDA approval. The differences are primarily the bureaucracy is sped up by making reports and data needing to be reviewed as soon as presented instead of them dithering with them in their mail boxes and companies can manufacture the vaccines during the clinical trials to be distributed immediately if approved for an EUA. Safety was demonstrated thoroughly in the trials and now we have hundreds of millions of real world data to confirm what the trials already demonstrated.</p>
<p>Actually mRNA vaccines had several successful animal trials which is why human mRNA vaccine clinical trials have been conducted for rabies, Zika virus, Influenza, and cytomegalovirus. Most recently of course were the covid19 vaccines and here are the studies themselves if you don’t believe me:</p>
<p>Here’s the animal study for Pfizer’s vaccine: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03275-y</p>
<p>Now here’s the Moderna mRNA vaccine animal study paper: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2024671</p>
<p>Of course you can just call these studies fake news or BS or whatever because you wanna dismiss anything and everything that goes against your pre-drawn conclusions that vaccines = bad.</p>

<p>It means you don't have any experience dealing with bureaucracy and the politics of it all. You're starry eyed and you believe the propaganda.</p>

<p>I'm actually a positive person. I just have experience you lack. Experts are frequently wrong and often corrupt.</p>
<p>&rt;Corruption is always a problem but it doesn’t rule every system that exists</p>
<p>I didn't say it rules them all. I said it's merely a question of how much. The higher the returns and the lower the risk, the more there is.</p>
<p>&rt;Safety was demonstrated thoroughly in the trials and now we have hundreds of millions of real world data to confirm what the trials already demonstrated.</p>
<p>How many people have been followed up with to determine this? Where's that data?</p>
<p>&rt;An EUA requires virtually the same testing, safety, efficacy, and review requirements as full FDA approval</p>
<p>This is a lie revealed by the fact the authorization is only on an emergency basis. If it were the same it wouldn't be an EUA.</p>
<p>What's missing is years of study to determine long term effects.</p>
<p>&rt;Actually mRNA vaccines had several successful animal trials</p>

        <p>Eh not really, more I know the actual logistics of the work and how the politics of it works - my PI is involved in organizing and advising numerous clinical trials. Our lab is involved with both charity, government, private, and corporate funding/collaborations... funding politics is something I’m up to my neck in. I also help review papers for peer-review so again the process of funding and then assessing scientific studies is fully in my wheelhouse.</p>
<p>“experts are frequently wrong”, wow it’s a wonder we have phones, surgeons, pharmaceuticals, cars, and the internet. Maybe your limited cohort of experts sucks but the consensus of the scientific community has consistently demonstrated its methods are reliable and yield positive tangible results.</p>
<p>You don’t need to follow up the clinical trials with repeated clinical trials when you have close to a billion people vaccinated. Public health data can be analyzed to confirm the trial results which actually has already been done and shows they were reflective of reality. And here’s a recent paper showing how the Pfizer vaccine is reducing covid19 at the population level in countries right now: https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765</p>
<p>Come on man, that’s literally what the FDA states is an EUA. As if you know better and have secret whistleblowers to suggest otherwise. You’re going just off the headline/title and ignoring the substance. Also vaccine adverse events virtually all occur rapidly within at most weeks to maybe a month or so. You do not have adverse events cropping up from vaccines years later, it’s just not how historically any vaccine has presented itself. Additionally just going off of the biochemistry of the mRNA vaccines, the mRNA is rapidly degraded by your cells as is the spike protein. In months nothing is left in your system.</p>
<p>Also I do appreciate you acknowledging the animal trials point, I am open to changing my views but I need evidence to do so. I’m not set in stone, I know there have been huge scientific findings that were dismissed by the scientific community in the past that after much fighting were proven definitively to be true and then adopted. Things like that may even be occurring now, but again it’s all in the evidence.</p>

<p>You say this without a second thought that you're describing corruption. It's endemic to the process. </p>
<p>&rt;“experts are frequently wrong”, wow it’s a wonder we have phones, surgeons, pharmaceuticals, cars, and the internet.</p>
<p>Absurd strawman. How do you make the leap from pointing out fallibility to a complete rejection of experts?</p>
<p>I'm advising skepticism in place of thoughtless acceptance, just like scientists are supposed to approach their work.</p>
<p>&rt;Maybe your limited cohort of experts sucks but the consensus of the scientific community has consistently demonstrated its methods are reliable and yield positive tangible results.</p>
<p>You mean like when all those uncorrupted experts said smoking wasn't harmful and doctors recommended it for pregnant women?</p>
<p>Or maybe like the Swine Flu vaccine debacle?</p>

<p>&rt;You don’t need to follow up the clinical trials with repeated clinical trials when you have close to a billion people vaccinated. Public health data can be analyzed to confirm the trial results which actually has already been done and shows they were reflective of reality</p>
<p>Why do you have such faith in pharmaceutical companies and government agencies who have track records of corruption and lying?</p>
<p>&rt;Come on man, that’s literally what the FDA states is an EUA.</p>

<p>&rt;Also vaccine adverse events virtually all occur rapidly within at most weeks to maybe a month or so. You do not have adverse events cropping up from vaccines years later, it’s just not how historically any vaccine has presented itself.</p>
<p>There is a first time for everything and this is new technology that has not been tested for long term safety.</p>
<p>I don't find trial data controlled and conducted by a pharma company to be reliable, and I don't find the lack of further active study to be further helpful.</p>

        <p>Well it depends on the context. With the same project would you give a  $300,000 grant to a lab that just formed in the last 2 years or to one with a decade+ long track record? That’s just one aspect of the funding politics, you need it to effectively dole out the money to projects most likely to succeed/advance the field.</p>
<p>Experts are fallible but YOU typed those exact words that experts are frequently wrong when no they aren’t. Pundits are, but those are almost always these days not real experts just self proclaimed ones.</p>
<p>So care to actually find some widespread modern examples not from a generation where people just sucked overall? Hell it was doctors not scientists pushing that crap because there wasn’t any evidence in the 30s, 40s, and 50s cigarettes were harmful since the studies weren’t done. But researchers eventually did provide the evidence and doctors (who are not typically educated in the research field) changed their tune quite quickly. It was ignorance not fraudelent scientific research that led to physican recommended cigarettes.</p>
<p>If you actually read into the 1976 swine flu stuff you’d actually find the vaccines weren’t harmful, it was more outspoken anti-vaxxers enciting fear and people falsely accusing the vaccines for various maladies. But keep picking really bad examples.</p>
<p>Maybe because my first reaction isn’t “all this science is garbage because a pharma company published it!” I mean who fucking else is going to conduct these massive studies and medical R&amp;D? You? Me? No it takes these massive companies and governments to do it, how short sighted are you? See I’m Canadian and I can only assume you’re American so our government actually takes care of us and reigns in pharma companies from maximizing profits at the expense of their customers.</p>
<p>Because full Authorization is a bureaucratic slog and it would’ve take far far far too long to get Full Approval - it would’ve been ethically irresponsible for them to go that route and sacrifice lives the vaccines could save when the data would be still obtained on a similar timeline. And like you actually care what the FDA says, if it was fully approved you still wouldn’t accept it.</p>
<p>Well if you want to live paranoid so be it, but the long term issues with catching covid19 have been demonstrated again and again - clearly your risk management is way out of whack.</p>
<p>Also you don’t trust any pharma company data? Hope you haven’t even bothered to take tylenol or advil before or needed any surgery. Hell don’t even bother with polysporin or antibiotics. You’re plainly ridiculous to dismiss any scientific data just cause it came from a pharma company... which are the only places any pharmaceutical comes from.</p>

        <p>False, I’m still getting my PhD and I’ve even taken part in the review process for grants to diversify the evaluation committee and ensure reviewers were kept at an arms length from the applicants. You can think that all science is funded by a powerful few but that simply isn’t the case.</p>
<p>You have proof that experts are frequently wrong? And how about actually defining “frequently” in this context? it’s a bit of a vague word when it should be actually quantified so we can objectively assess the rate of right vs. wrong. And remember, scientists aren’t fortune tellers, their statements are always guided by the scientific data available at the time and are subject to revision as new data comes out - that’s what makes science so reliable.</p>
<p>Well let’s just wait and hope for someone to make all the investments in the people and infrastructure out of the goodness of their hearts huh? Companies profiting from their own pharmaceutical/medical intervention products is fine for the same reason farmers should profit from their food sales - it takes massive committments to undergo these endeavours. Unchecked profits however need to be kept under control which the US seems to be the only developed country that can’t accomplish this because of their religious belief in maximizing pure capitalism even in their healthcare system.</p>
<p>And what makes these independent groups impartial? You’re just making the already complicated logistics of medical R&amp;D that much harder without dealing with your stated problem.</p>
<p>hahahahah okay yeah nice blanket statement, but the covid-19 screwups came not from scientists but from scientists being ignored with politicians thinking they know befged and public anti-science rhetoric taking its hold into politics.</p>

        <p>LOL oh god here we go with the RCT. You realize it isn’t always ethical to run an RCT? You can’t test a vaccine in people and the intentionally expose them to a virus you don’t have a cure for. If the vaccine doesn’t work you’ve just deliberately caused immense human harm. So instead you vaccinate tens of thousands of people and let them go about their daily lives, tracking them for a specific amount of time. And relative to a placebo group you tally up infections between the two groups. That’s the only ethical way to test novel vaccines.</p>
<p>You saying RCTs are the only way to make clinical research decisions are using the same arguement for people claiming cigarettes don’t cause cancer. Because no RCT has been done where they forced people to smoke and others to not and then see cancer rates over the span of a decade or so. Such an experiment is unethical and causes undue human harm.</p>

        <p>Actually there is an arguement to be had that many medical interventions are being done without benefit and solely because of historical precident - basically there is no evidence for the practice. So perhaps it is worthwhile doing RCTs or other efficacy/safety studies on drugs that have never had them done due to them being introduced so long ago before standardization in the medical/pharmaceutical field or have not been proven effective from real world data.</p>

        <p>Ah, well no I don’t think you should just give random medications to try and see what works in an emergency. Of course you can treat with current medications that tackle existing symptoms of the disease.</p>
<p>I think you enact something like the RECOVERY trial where based on the pathogen and symptoms of the disease you test several treatment regimens of various types with existing interventions. It doesn’t need to be a long trial and it can more quickly and reliably identify how best to treat patients.</p>

        <p>How did the virus get in the home? It had to come from somewhere outside the home first.</p>
<p>I can't comment to more infections happening inside the home, that would make sense though since you're in close contact with others. That's why it was important to prevent the spread in public.</p>

        <p>Covid-19 spreads indoors when someone breathes infected air for about 15 minutes.  There are lots of public places where masks are required but where infection is extremely unlikely, such as spacious retail stores and grocery stores.</p>
<p>During the lockdown regime, "non-essential" businesses were closed but homes were not.  People were free to visit each other in their homes. </p>
<p>Additionally, there were "essential" businesses that were open whose working conditions were good for the transmission of Covid-19, like food processing plants, or medical care facilities.  I have to presume that Covid-19 was being spread in these businesses (even with mask mandates) as well as from home to home, since after Christmas there was a surge in cases in my area even though there were strict mask mandates.</p>
<p>I presume that infections have taken place in a combination of public and private indoor spaces.  It's possible for there to be a line of private space infections from the first infected workers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology to people in other countries, although it is probably some combination of private and public indoor spaces.  </p>
<p>The scientific evidence seems to be that masks probably have some small positive effect on the transmission of Covid-19, even though there is no "slam dunk", and the only double blind trial showed a slight benefit that was too small to be statistically significant.  </p>
<p>However, the effect (if any) is only useful in environments were Covid-19 can actually be transmitted: indoor, poorly ventilated spaces where people spend 15 minutes or more in the same place.</p>

        <p>&rt;Covid-19 spreads indoors when someone breathes infected air for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>That's not accurate. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;There are lots of public places where masks are required but where infection is extremely unlikely, such as spacious retail stores and grocery stores.</p>
<p>That's also not accurate.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;During the lockdown regime, "non-essential" businesses were closed but homes were not. People were free to visit each other in their homes.</p>
<p>That's not entirely accurate either. Most states told people to stay in a 'bubble' and to not visit relatives or households they didn't live in.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Additionally, there were "essential" businesses that were open whose working conditions were good for the transmission of Covid-19, like food processing plants, or medical care facilities. I have to presume that Covid-19 was being spread in these businesses (even with mask mandates) as well as from home to home, since after Christmas there was a surge in cases in my area even though there were strict mask mandates.</p>
<p>I would agree that a lot of employers didn't go the extra mile to prevent the spread of covid. </p>
<p>How would you effectively stop people from visiting family? Law enforcement has been hesitant to even enforce the restrictions at businesses - a few even publicly stated they wouldn't.</p>
<p>This is where people needed to heed the advice of the government and health care professionals and not visit (&amp; spread) covid. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The scientific evidence seems to be that masks probably have some small positive effect on the transmission of Covid-19, even though there is no "slam dunk", and the only double blind trial showed a slight benefit that was too small to be statistically significant.</p>
<p>This sounds inaccurate. Masks along with social distancing and limiting public exposure is what's needed, not masks alone. </p>
<p>Take a look at reports coming out about how covid restrictions have changed the cold and flu season. </p>
<p>How would you explain that?</p>

<p>Do you remember the Rose Garden super spreader event that was hosted outside  where the President of the United States contracted it along with many others who then spread it to other people?</p>

    <div class="collapsible">
        <p>Then what is the mechanism for the spread of Covid-19?  Please explain it.  </p>
<p>But yes, my statement is inaccurate because there are infections that have occurred outside those parameters.  However, it describes a large majority of cases of infection.  Covid-19 is spread by aerosols, which is what the data support, regardless of what the WHO may be saying.  The vast majority of known transmissions have occurred in indoor settings or semi-enclosed outdoor settings with poor ventilation, because again, aerosols.  Refer to the NYT May 11 article about how the CDC's guidelines on outdoor transmission were wrong.  There many recent studies that show transmission outdoors is very unlikely, although not impossible.  </p>
<p>There is also evidence is that there is a threshold of virus that you have to be exposed to in order to become infected.  That means there is a temporal element, which has traditionally been described as 15 minutes.  Of course, that's not true, since in a certain percentage of cases people have been infected with less time, and others have also avoided infection after contact of 15 minutes or more.</p>
<p>I don't know all the details of the purported super spreader event at the Rose Garden.  Apparently a whole 12 out of 200 later tested positive.<br>
https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2020/10/07/likely-rose-garden-covid-superspreader-white-house-drew-hundreds/3636925001/</p>
<p>Is there evidence that the people who were tested positive didn't also spend time together indoors or in cars?  I look at that pattern, and I suspect that those individuals could just have easily contracted the virus in some other setting besides during that particular ceremony.  Also, an event like this would never have received any scientific attention if it weren't for the person holding it.  </p>
<p>Do you remember that Missouri pool party where one person tested positive for Covid?  The authorities were just sure that it would be a super spreader event.  It wasn't.  https://www.bizpacreview.com/2020/06/04/no-new-cases-of-covid-19-found-among-lake-of-the-ozarks-party-goers-missouri-health-offical-reports-930014/</p>
