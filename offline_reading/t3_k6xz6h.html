    <strong>Does anybody remember the day the covid plan truly began in North America, and the deception they used to begin the fear? I do, quite well.</strong>
    <p><p>March 11, 2020. A day or 2 prior, as we knew about the Coronavirus, Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert came out for a press briefing and jokingly touched all the microphones, like a "haha they said I shouldnt do this!" Type of stupid little joke. </p>
<p>Well apparently <em>they</em> didnt think it was funny. Because on march 11, the day everything changed forever, as the utah jazz were set to face the Oklahoma city thunder, and all the fans were in attendance, the fans were all ordered to "stay calm but leave immediately" as one of the players has coronavirus. Which player? Yep! You guessed it! Rudy Gobert! Oh, and in very short order they were somehow able to figure out that his star teammate also got it, and the star teammate was mad because they knew with certainty that HE caught it from GOBERT. (That careless, heartless jerk! Dont be like him!) At first I thought "huh, what a weird coincidence, out of the 500 nba players, the first case was the guy who mocked it." Looking back now, it's clear they either got to him or used him. </p>
<p>And then just as the NBA shutdown was sending shockwaves through social media, another piece of news down the pipe. Another famous celebrity has Coronavirus! Who? Well, none other than americas best pal, friendly regular neighbor next door type, actor TOM HANKS! (Oh shit! If tom can get it, anyone can get it!)</p>
<p>I look back now at the absurdity of it all. Day 1 of the rollout. The first 2 high profile cases: the athlete who just mocked it, and Americas most famous and lovable actor  The perfect posterboys. It was very effective. It got everybody talking about it, and everybody fearful of it. The groundwork was quickly complete thanks to the forest fire speed of social media. </p>
<p>I've never noticed anyone question the odds that Gobert was the first case, and good ol hanks that same night. To me it seems like a cheesy movie, where they're using blatant propaganda. </p>
<p>Thanks, and fuck Tom hanks.</p></p>

        <p>What a fun month March was. I remember some videos of some chinese lady walking on the sidewalk and just randomly falling over and the berserk hysteria that preceded it. </p>
<p>I also remember the "apocalyptic conditions" of the New York City hospitals and some news station got busted red-handed for directly copying footage from Italy's hospital and saying it was New York's.</p>

        <p>I knew they had long term plans with this hoax as soon as I saw the stupid marks on the floor of grocery stores saying: stand here - and the plexiglass at the cashiers. </p>
<p>It was a dead giveaway. On one hand they were talking about 2 weeks to flatten the curve, on the other hand there was massive investment everywhere in reprogramming and brainwashing people.</p>

        <p>In stupid vivid detail. March 18, I was driving home at night from a restaurant (which was eerily empty) and it was really foggy, and the LED sign on the highway usually reserved for traffic messages read “CORONAVIRUS EXERCISE CAUTION”... (I think this was before the name COVID-19 took off) and I found it spooky and knew in my gut it was going to get worse...</p>

        <p>The weekend before they shut everything down (in Illinois) was so surreal.  It was this weird twilight zone between two worlds, the old normal and the dystopian  new normal.  Nobody had any clue how deep this was about to go.  Everyone just thought it would be a couple of weeks.  Here we are almost NINE MONTHS LATER WITH NO CHANGE.  Anyone who thinks this isn't meant to be permanent is a stupid asshole.</p>

        <p>All the comments here are great.  Such un-fond memories of a wasted year.  People losing their jobs, their incomes, their homes, their hope.  Trillions just handed out, often, to the wrong people.  A US economy that was moving along well, but was truly the one thing that could re-elect a President hated by media and left wing ideology.</p>
<p>So, a concerted effort to wreck us all began.  And it was so effective.  The marketers got on board really quick.  Mainstream media pumped our TV’s full of propaganda, and we created a divided nation hell bent on destroying one another.</p>
<p>We are not the America of 1941, who could unite and conquer an opposing force.  We are far less than that.  Brush up on your Mandarin Chinese; your going to need it.</p>

        <p>You are right to a certain extent. For a lot of my friends, the cancelling of the NBA season was when shit got REAL. </p>
<p>I had been paying attention since January since I’m in the medical field. I knew it was coming and there was very little we could do to stop it. I knew a lot of people were probably gonna die. Luckily the virus clearly killed almost exclusively elderly people (like every other seasonal flu virus. </p>
<p>But I NEVER in a million years thought they would shut down society like they did for a virus with such a low mortality rate. That part made absolutely no sense. People just absolutely freaked the F out, plain and simple. And the politicians took advantage of the fear.</p>
<p>But ya most of my friends did not give a flying F about any of this stuff until they canceled sports. The whole world went nuts cancelling everything. Following the NBAs lead.</p>

        <p>Matt Hancock, and UK health minister Nadine Dorries, the French culture minister Franck Riester and a few others too, but for us in Europe, I think it just hit the capital cities then: high-profile cases were a given. If anything the surprising part is that more of them didn't get it more obviously, shows how nothing covid usually is, or almost all the politicians would've been visibly ill imo. It's not like they all follow rules or are cautious...</p>

        <p>This is very interesting and a great point. I hadn’t yet reflected on the NBA thing. Looking back, it is a totally absurd coincidence that the one player who joked about it was the one player to get it and then spread it to his teammate. It set up the whole media circuit and storyline perfectly. You also have to love how they allowed the entire stadium to fill with fans and then conveniently made this dramatic announcement seconds before tip off, which of course went viral on social media. The NBA has definitely become one of the biggest propaganda tool organizations in recent years so it makes sense that the powers that be would use them to fear-monger. I’ll admit at the time I was even buying into some of the fear. </p>
<p>The Tom Hanks thing has been brought up before and it’s another good point. Without getting into too much detail...you can do your own research around the internet about Hanks (SRC USA). It seems pretty likely to me he isn’t just an actor. Convenient that America’s favorite family man actor would get it first. </p>
<p>Furthermore, ever notice how none of these celebrities, athletes, actors, etc actually...ya know...get really sick from coronavirus? All these news reports of celebrities and pro and college athletes “testing positive” but they’re never actually very sick. And they sure as hell don’t die (unless you wanna count Herman “stage 4 cancer” Cain). For a global pandemic, what are the chances that literally none of these celebrities, athletes, politicians, etc who are still traveling all over the country die from it? Or even get very sick? Nope, just a quick headline about the next one to “test positive,” it’s in the news for a week, then move one. Rinse and repeat. </p>
<p>It’s all so tiresome.</p>

        <p>I remember that night! Don't forget Rudy Gobert is a stupid French pussy bitch too and Donovan Mitchell is a handsome young rising star in the NBA. I'm being somewhat facetious with that but lol what a night. Fred Hoiberg was coaching Nebraska in the first round of the B10 Tournament that night too and he was coughing and sweating and sneezing and shit on the sidelines and everyone was freaking out..it came out that he had the flu but, alas, the rest of March Madness was cancelled within 48 hours.</p>

        <p>I was really busy with work in March and didn't pay any attention to news or current events, I had no idea about any virus until the presidents state of emergency declaration. Then I looked it up and shrugged my shoulders and still didn't think about it until we got sent home from work "for a week" which turned into a second week, then until May... and I haven't been back since.</p>

        <p>It was very interesting that corporate America basically shut down as soon as the NBA did. I mean its weird in way that somehow the NBA would be at the focal point of whether o not to shut down. But its big enough that it gets coverage in every paper, transcends race and sex larger than any active spring sport. Certainly larger than Baseball and Hockey in terms of active fans and following amongst the younger online generation.</p>

Trump lied. People died.
It's not your fault you got confused. CDC director Redfield was at fault too. He's a Trump flunky.
