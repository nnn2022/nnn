        <p>Democracy is the system in which the rich became the richest they ever where.</p>
<p>But Im glad that you are not talking about collectivist communism. Which is what most associate with that. Id suggest you and your kind make that distinction more clearly, because many will think you must be crazy for wanting to life in East Germany and the likes.</p>
<p>Fwiw, as far as Im concerned most of us want the same, but we use different words to describe it.</p>

        <p>No, not democracy. Capitalism is the system. Of course when we allow capital to influence our politics, the capitalists will use that capital to influence politics in ways that are favorable to further consolidation of capital. Corporatism/cronyism/whatever you want to call it is nothing but the inevitable result of consolidated capital under capitalism. </p>
<p>Most communists nowadays are ancoms. Libertarian communists. Y'all just can't argue against that because it's a very populist idea once it is explained, so of course you have to argue against the strawman of authoritarian communism instead.</p>

<p>Huh? You didn't make me use shit. If y'all can't see through the propaganda, you never will. Imagine thinking you're awake with half your brain still asleep, one eye closed, and the other only barely cracked</p>
<p>&rt;Also your entire argument so far is that we are stupid because we dont want to tax the rich, which is entirely untrue and simply a false premise. Stop claiming otherwise.</p>
<p>When you simp for capitalism, your simp for capitalists. You work to further their goals.</p>
<p>&rt;</p>
<p>&rt;So, again how did democracy do in regards to limiting the accumuluation of capital? So good that you come in here wanting a different system.</p>
<p>Democracy within a political system that is based on capitalism and relies on capital to fund politicians' elections will never truly work against capital. Look at how hard they worked to shut Bernie down, and how easily Trump co-opted faux populism to work to benefit capital, his corporate tax cuts being the easiest indication. </p>
<p>&rt;Also, please just a single time explain what you actually want instead of telling me I have no idea... THATS WHY I ASK...</p>
<p>Libertarian communism. Worker owned production. Would you vote for your workplace to pollute in your backyard? Do credit unions engage in any of the predatory actions that private banks do?</p>
<p>&rt;</p>
<p>&rt;
&rt;Okay, let me ask you a question, are you a Trump fan?
&rt;
&rt;I could be wrong, but Id guess you hate him. Yet, he got voted.</p>
<p>Because of affirmative action for Republicans. He got BTFO in the popular vote both times. Most people say right through his con. Just not enough in the states that receive affirmative action in the voting process</p>
<p>&rt;Why do you think that voting in itself leads to a different world than the one we have now, were we supposedly already vote on the major issues?</p>
<p>What do you think better represents you and your neighbors views: your local government or the national government? </p>
<p>Again, capital controls our election process, but far less on a local scale (though it still does).</p>

<p>Needless to say, no one, literally no one (not even billionaires themselves) argue against higher taxes for billionairs. The issue with your left people isnt that they want to raise to taxes for billionaires, its almost everything else they are proposing.</p>

&rt;Again, who is this "left" you are talking about? Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, AOC, Clinton?</p>
<p>The fact that you put 3 shitlib centrists, who are center left at best, if not center right, in with the left, shows you don't know the first thing about the left. I take it you're on the right? If I said Rand Paul, Romney, Trump, and McCain were all the exact same because they're all right wing, how serious would you take my knowledge of the right?</p>
<p>&rt;How exactly are they planning to tax the rich? Be precise please.</p>
<p>Giving the Amazon workers at least 20% of Bezos's stock for starters. Taxing all transactions on Wall Street a small amount, that would only be a rounding error on long term holdings and only effect the people who treat it like a game for another. Have you really read up on none of the plans? Like, none at all?</p>
<p>&rt;Needless to say, no one, literally no one (not even billionaires themselves) argue against higher taxes for billionairs. The issue with your left people isnt that they want to raise to taxes for billionaires, its almost everything else they are proposing.</p>
<p>BS. That's the culture war, dude. That's the divide and conquer at work, and you're falling for it. I've had people un-ironically say Bezos was a leftist to me. You ain't that dumb, are you?</p>
<p>&rt;And for what its worth, Im neither a liberal nor a centrist or right or anything. Nor would you see me point any fingers towards any person thats supposed to bring the light.</p>
<p>BS</p>

        <p>Because y'all are still playing right along with their game. You ain't attacking the real source. You're playing the role of opposition exactly like the capitalists want you to. And you claim to see through the propaganda. You don't. Y'all are just falling for different propaganda. Divide and conquer. And y'all are dancing right to their tune</p>
