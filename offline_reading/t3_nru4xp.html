    <strong>I'm an ex lefty who needs guidance</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I grew up fairly liberal and I must admit I've lived in a bubble chamber most of my life. I watch CNN once a week or so, I go to a good college etc. But today a friend told me to just read some of Fauci's emails. Now the truth is crashing down. I am using an throwaway (I made a new account but I guess this subreddit has karma limits so I had to try again). A lot of my friends know my reddit name and I DO NOT want them to see this post. But when I know more I think I can convince them, just need to learn how.</p>
<p>But yeah my friend basically said, "do your research and start with these emails". The research I've always done involved textbooks, scholarly resources and what have you. Obviously, that's not going to fly since the people who wrote the textbooks, I fear, are in on it, with these topics and I want to learn to research better. What advice do you have for researching? What is the proper way to research?
Thank you.</p></p>

        <p>Same here. I used to be more on the liberal side. I'm 34 now and I stopped watching TV 10 years ago when I realized it was all propaganda. Left or right. When I see news articles and something peeks my interest I start looking for the real story. </p>
<p>Welcome to the other side. </p>
<p>There are some nut jobs on here too but that's everywhere in the world. But at the same time I used to think Alex Jones was a complete nut until I realized how much shit he was actually right about.</p>

        <p>Oh where to begin...ancaps amd libertarians have been calling this whole thing bullshit day one. Youngrippa59, Michael Malice, Tom Woods and Luke Rudkowski (Wearechange) for starters. </p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Then you have the WEF/davos group's the great reset: you will own nothing and you will be happy. They delete the original video after they got bashed for the socialist utopian it was. </p>
<p>Here is a copy of the original video: https://youtu.be/tOwhdS9Cel0</p>
<p>Not to mention covid19 is a virus with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. The common flu has an IFR of 0.01% BTW most of my links are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. The rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI
https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Masks dont work, especially the fabric ones:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links so take them with a grain of salt:</p>

<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work ans some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>Covid19  is a virus with a 99.85% survival rate and an IFR of .15%. In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>

<p>Btw that translates to survival rates by age (if you get infected):</p>

<p>18-49                99.95%</p>

        <p>Welcome to a new way of life! Sadly, lies and propaganda come in all forms, including original sources and studies. Even those people talking about critical thinking...don't seem to understand what that means. But, we all get better the more we ask questions and look at many sides. It's not left or right. It's using your brain. As for this topic (vax/C19), there is a bunch of good information on how to treat the disease and how to be healthy to decrease chances of getting a severe case. The shots haven't been out long enough to have great data. That's a problem.  However, there are definitely markers that are concerning. If you want to ask specific questions, we can provide information on each facet that you can study. What were some clues that things may not be as they appear? American Medical Association giving docs advice on  how to talk to patients who are vax hesitant. The advice starts by saying there are only two camps: those willing to be vaccinated and anti-vaxxers. Check their site. Second, how very little detailed information about how the shot worked. All we here is safe, effective, spike protein. That was even true when visiting with personal physicians. Asking questions got non-responsive answers. Third, pushing people, bribing people and repeating the same message and suppressing information are big flashing signs. Fourth, how could you possibly know the shot was safe? Look at the criteria for who was part of the studies and how few people actually got the virus. Fifth, if the flu shot is usually only 40-50% effective, how are these shots double the effectiveness? Why haven't the flu shots been re-engineered if the tech is so awesome? The list goes on. The point is, it's this type logic that you use when presented with bold statements to start deciphering what is the truth. You can't rely on information disseminated alone. You must ask questions, draw parallels. When people won't answer questions, or deflect, change the subject, get belligerent or give answers that don't hold water, keep digging. People who know what they're talking about or who enjoy a healthy debate, welcome questions (maybe as a sidebar if there's an agenda and a lot to cover), who will consider other points of view, are the ones to spend your time with. Great job so far! Keep it up!</p>

<p>Is a good documentary to show you the tip of the iceberg...</p>
<p>Why the so called elites might want to depopulate then control us all.
It is very informative and completely factual... no baseless claims, everything is backed up by video footage etc.</p>
<p>There will be more to follow, I can show you if you want to after watching that one first.</p>

        <p>I was on the left most of my life. My core beliefs that made me go to the left were aversion to George Bush's forever wars and strong support of civil liberties.  </p>
<p>Trump broke the GOP and many of the permanent war hawks changed to the DNC and Biden's cabinet has welcomed them with open arms.  COVID restrictions show that civil liberties are no longer important to the left.</p>
<p>Where to start?  Everywhere.  Just look at different things with an open mind and find yourself.  COVID is a key issue now, so here's a great interview with a leading medical expert. It's long, but excellent.</p>

        <p>&rt; But when I know more I think I can convince them</p>
<p>Aw, that's adorable. I hate to break the bad news, but we all thought this at one point. The unfortunate reality seems to be that, for most people, the only way out of believing the propaganda is to independently realize its propaganda all by one's self, as you did. Remember, two weeks ago, if someone told you covid originated in a lab, you would have dismissed them out of hand as a loony conspiracy theorist, and nothing they could have said would have convinced you, because you simply <em>knew</em> that covid didn't come from a lab. That's what you're up against. If reading Fauci's emails is what did it for you, by all means, show your friends what you saw. You may convince them, as you were convinced, but don't go into that interaction working under the assumption that convincing them is possible.</p>
<p>As far as research, honestly, I dunno what to tell you. Google, the search engine, really isn't that helpful, what since Google, the corporation, is one of the entities helping spread covid propaganda. Even just scrounging around the internet is only going to turn up left wing sources, right wing sources, scientific papers that are unintelligible to the average person, and a very small number of "fringe" news sites, the likes that can actually run articles skeptical of the covid narrative since they have no corporate masters. The first two will be useless in your endeavor, the third is very difficult to use as evidence for making a point in non-academic conversation, and the fourth will be written off by the average person as, you guessed it, conspiracy theorist nonsense. There's a great wealth of non-reddit sources in this sub and others, for almost any multiple-thousand-upvote post on this sub, somewhere in the comments section someone will have some relevant links. Raises the obvious question of "but where did those people get the links?" but there's only so much time in the day.</p>

        <p>I think the deeper you go into this new way of thinking (welcome by the way, not many have their eyes opened), the more you will see how even the textbooks and scholarly sources have been corrupted. Most of what is popular- is false. That’s what I’ve found to be true. Any information being censored is something to look into. Conspiracy theories are mostly things that your government or science/medical industries don’t want you looking into. Once you realize that there are powerful and evil people running the world governments and the organizations that we trust so much in- you’ll understand why so much of what we know as true- is false. </p>
<p>With everything that’s happened this past year with covid and all the lies being spread- I now question everything I’ve been told before and can see how easily those in power can manipulate how people must think on a matter. I used to believe like most people do about government and the media and healthcare and all that but what finally opened my eyes was reading about our CIA and what they have done/are doing to people. That blew me away and it was really difficult to process that the country I felt so proud of for years- was so evil at the core- and why hadn’t I been told any of this before? If the CIA could do those things, where it’s documented fact that it was occurring- why should I ever trust the government and view them as good? Then I learned of Operation Paperclip- where our government secretly brought over tons of Nazi’s after the war- to use them for their knowledge, many of them working in the labs experimenting on people. This was just the tip of the iceberg though and I’ve since learned far worse. Currently- the gov, healthcare industry and media are all singing the praises of vaccines that have heading towards half a million adverse reaction reports and 5k deaths- just in the US, and nothing is being done but upping the bribes to get people to take them. </p>
<p>It’s really important to have people to talk to who share these views because it’s a lonely life when your eyes are opened to all this stuff and you can’t go back. Stay connected to groups/friends that see the truth so you don’t feel like an outsider because they’re trying to make us look like insane people when we’re really the ones running away from the cliff everyone else is jumping off of.</p>

        <p>It depends on what you are looking for, as far as the effects of Covid, looking into actual studies focusing on the demographics of who dies and who doesn’t. </p>
<p>As for vaccines, there are very few resources since it is politically expedient for everyone to have everyone vaccinated. If you don’t want to get vaccinated look at the demographics see if you fall in any high risk areas if you don’t it’s similar to the flu as far as death rates give or take some basis points. </p>
<p>Subscribe to this thread and take every single news article with a grain of salt. Rather than read the article go to the study cited in the article. </p>
<p>This is more work, but you cut straight through all the bullshit on the right and left.</p>

        <p>Yes we do.  All I did was read Pubmed for studies on SARS and corona viruses for the first couple months Covid19 began in the news.  I'm sure MANY other free thinkers did the same.  </p>
<p>Fascinating how long mainstream news takes to catch up with research we have the power to do ourselves.  I knew by March or April 2020, about gain of function research, that it was most likely a lab leak, funding ties, the failed vaccine attempts that wrecked the animals that were later exposed to SARS after being vaccinated, the coincidence of the Event 201 drill.  The whole thing was there to read.  </p>
<p>I couldn't convince my liberal parents of any of it, or to even read anything.  </p>

        <p>You could start by telling us what you've already read.  Actual textbooks are good because they are likely written before this crisis and for a different purpose than media headlines and sadly, current papers. </p>
<p>The Fauci emails are interesting, but most of the relevant stuff is either stuff we already knew from Fauci's other flip flopping or stuff that they are just discussing.</p>

        <p>Exactly that, I’m very conservative and and anti-authoritarian. Right now the authorities are left leaning  neoliberals, and socialists. I am not a hardline anti Covid vaccine person. I am not getting it because I am in a low risk group, but I know people who have it and if I were them I would have gotten it. As far as studies it will vary from study to study and I often take my conclusions and am corrected and adjust my opinion accordingly. To really get into it you’d need to name your top 5 issues and discuss those issues with people on the opposite side. For example if you were a hardline lockdown guy, the is 0 proof that lockdowns  worked and likely most lock down states performed worse, and hurt their economies by multiples of non lockdown states. The big problem here is Reddit is a hive mind and actual discussions only happen in fringe subs like this, conservative, or conspiracy etc. (For every instance of anti Semitism there I have had at least two good conversations with people.)</p>

        <p>It depends on what you’re wanting to research. But once you see the truth, you can’t unsee it. Therefore the lies start to become more &amp; more obvious, and you’ll get to a point where you’re just thoroughly disgusted with all of it, all the time. This holds true for pretty much everything in our world: politics, media, “conspiracies”, the healthcare system/allopathic medicine, education... the list goes on.

        <p>I'm a far leftist/socialist initially radicalized by the war in Iraq when I was starting college. I still feel steadfast in my core beliefs. I think it's important to realize democrats aren't left-wing, they are authoritarian, police-state supporting neoliberals, and CNN (and other corporate media), while commonly referred to as "liberal" or left-learning, actually serve to propagate the interests of the ultra-wealthy and corporations.</p>
<p>I have things in common with libertarian leaning republicans, such as belief that the working class should never be disarmed. I still disagree with the vast majority of right wing thought however.</p>
<p>That said, I am so thankful that this new normal shit has *has* become a politicized issue, and that red states are handling the insanity so much better than blue ones. I'm even considering moving to a red state if "vaccine passports" continue to gain traction.</p>
<p>I guess to summarize my advice is to keep reading and researching, carve out your own political thought and identity, realize it's not as simple as red vs. blue and hope common sense and reason are things that can unite us all regardless of our background or how we label ourselves.</p>

        <p>I’m glad that you woke up there’s a lot of people who STILL believe that the government and media would not lie to them. Learn to dissect the news you hear. Your political stance should not be swayed from the truth. You used to lean left I lean right but we all need to recognize that these are all just distractions. Cleverly designed to divide all of us as many ways as possible. If the people who are calling the shots can keep us fighting they can continue to rape the common people while letting the rich and powerful get away with murder. We all need to unite and make OUR world better instead of expecting the govt to do to it. We need to honestly stand up for each other and take back our freedom and MAKE laws that will limit the government’s reach. They have shown for a long time that they don’t care about the common man and women who fund their misdeeds</p>

Some alternative news is pretty good, don't throw out the baby with the bathwater if an alternative news site reports mostly good stuff, but sometimes is skewed or gives bad info.  Just be picky on what to take as Gospel.  Don't make any journalist into an idol for truth.  </p>
<p>You will have to weed through a lot of crap, but there is real truth to be found and peace of mind thinking for yourself and knowing how you came to a certain conclusion, not that you were just fed what to think.  Try to vet everything you can, but don't use fact checking websites, they are garbage usually and play word games to "debunk", do the checking yourself instead.  </p>
<p>Use multiple sources for information, and it's okay to not have your mind made up on a subject until you feel you truly understand it.  Use Pubmed.  </p>
<p>Learn to spot propaganda and coercion tactics.  Learn to spot opinions cloaked as facts in arguments that aren't backed by real hard data that you can retrieve yourself, and aren't just parroting.  Don't trust anyone solely due to their title / position in the world.   </p>
<p>Good luck and God Bless.</p>

        <p>I know this is not a "research" based answer but in the past 18 months, I tuned in more to what I was seeing with my own eyes as my primary source of information. I know our daily lives generally offer little in the way of variation but it can be a good way to calibrate. I would drib=ve by the local hospital...not overwhelmed. I would drive around my city...no one dying in the streets. I would travel around my state...no race riots. I would go to the grocery store...lots of masking and dystopian announcements but no one falling ill in the aisles.</p>
<p>I struggle like everyone here with ways to find trustworthy information. Don't discount what you personally observe every day, especially when contrasted with what you read and hear online/on tv.</p>

        <p>Well this is very nice.</p>
<p>I've been liberal all my life, stumped for Bernie, voted for Obama twice, at this point I'm completely done with those people. I don't have any real advice for you on politics, but rather generalized advice. </p>
<p>Trust yourself. If something feels off, sensational, or weird, look into it. You'll have to parse ALOT of info, because everyone on every side has an angle, but eventually you'll arrive at a somewhat educated understanding of what reality is. That applies to everything in this sub - especially the more sensational things.</p>
<p>I left the Jehovah's Witnesses (cult) at a younger age. It's funny how similarly your post reads to young 'apostates' leaving the faith. Understand that it's the same thing. Most people do not reach their opinions and conclusions rationally. You seem to, but that won't appeal to other people. Abandon the idea that you can convince anyone of anything. Seek out people who value the same things you do - namely, truth, rationality, or as close of an approximation to it as you can get.</p>
<p>good luck</p>

        <p>Also a leftie turned right. Not completely right but no longer can say I’m a democrat. Not sure random YouTube videos will steer you in one direction or another. What did it for me was the ability to think for myself. Research the major topics being pushed in the news. Everything is for a narrative. Why is that? Questioning these things instead of regurgitating it really opened my eyes. Don’t expect others to be open to discussion of these topics from the other side. This isn’t a right wing sub. It’s for those who identify as individuals.</p>
