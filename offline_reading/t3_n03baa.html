    <strong>Most Culturally Free City in Texas?</strong>
    <p><p>I tried to ask this question in r/FortWorth but it was immediately deleted. Anyone here that can comment on anti-mask and anti-lockdown sentiments in Texas generally but more specifically Fort Worth?</p>
<p>I've heard good things, generally that it's anti-mask enough that you can go about your business without ever really needing one.</p>
<p>I'm in a blueish metropolitan and finally going to flee. It's not the worst as I get away with never wearing a mask for my "medical exemption" but I'm hassled for it all the time.</p>
<p>Rural seems to be an answer but I'm not sure I'm ready to go full rural and would love to find a place within 1.5 hours of a city which is why the Fort Worth area has caught my attention. Are there any neighborhoods of Fort Worth that culturally don't care about the bullshit? I'll settle for indifferent to the mask but would love a true seething of it.</p>
<p>Still strange to me that I grew up to left leaning parents with higher education and a ticket to polite society. Post covid I want nothing to do with polite society and am looking for some deplorables.</p></p>

        <p>An hour out of any major city in Texas is going to be pretty much normal at this point. Just try to get as far out as you can bear.</p>

        <p>Ft. Worth is more normal than Dallas, but all Texas cities are nuts.  </p>
<p>Why not take a vacation and spend a week driving around the state to see where you like?  </p>
<p>Burleson, Saginaw, North Richland Hills, Weatherford, Keller, Pantego and Southlake all seem to be places I'd suggest you visit if you want to be near Fort Worth.</p>

        <p>&rt;I’d look at conservative midsized cities of like 75-100k. Go as deep red as you can tolerate, there’s an undeniable correlation.</p>
<p>Lol yeah I hear good things about Austin but it tends to be from people who just moved from NY or LA. Compared to those shitholes almost anything would seem great.</p>

        <p>It <em>used</em> to be a great city. Libertarian paradise where everyone just did their own thing and minded their own business. Then the transplants started shitting it up.</p>
<p>And on top of the cultural and political shift, the city is flat out growing <em>way</em> too fast for the infrastructure to keep up (I-35 most of the day will make you want run everyone off the road). It's only gotten worse with the new Tesla factory being built, and real estate around that part of town is <em>obscene</em>.</p>

        <p>I'd say Fort Worth as well, but idk specific neighborhoods or anything. I'm in San Antonio and although there's a bunch of fuckin doomers on the SA sub, no one has ever said anything to me in person. I spend all my weekends and free time in more rural parts of TX anyway, I try to stay at the state parks and camp, BBQ etc. Totally chill out there, all normal people.</p>

        <p>Sweet, thanks for the insight, much appreciated. I know this isn't as big a deal for some people, but after a year of getting lectured every time I leave my apartment (living downtown is the worst) it's important to me: what's the mask culture like where you are? Is it required at stores and restaurants and do you get hassled if you don't have one?</p>

        <p>Not a bad idea. Maybe I need to ditch the fantasy that I could be near a big city and avoid the bullshit. Any top cities/town come to mind?</p>

        <p>Nah I’m in Oklahoma - went to the reddest suburb outside Tulsa. For me it’s an insane improvement because I came here from Portland (ew). And I do like being near a city (though Tulsa is tiiiiny compared to most TX cities!). I travel around to smaller towns on the weekend (I like exploring) and it’s heartening. Masks are almost non existent in some places outside the metro. It’s a balancing act for me. I am mostly okay with the fact that in my metro suburb, I am never ever hassled for not wearing a mask (people are sooo nice here compared to the west coast), AND I am never the only person without a mask in any store. I’m never the sore thumb. I’d have been happy just to not be hassled, but to have some company in my masklessness is extra bonus. The other day in Home Depot in Tulsa proper I finally saw more customers without masks than those with them. Also the other day at the post office (!!) there were three federal employees maskless. Good enough for me. I’m still young and not ready to live in the middle of nowhere quite yet.</p>
