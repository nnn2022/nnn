    <strong>If you were propagandized, you would have absolutely no clue.</strong>
    <p><p>I see far too many folks these days using their own personal frame of reference regarding certain issues such as the degree of tyranny in the recent virus response or the level of corruption within our governmental structures and treating that frame of reference as infallible, or completely substantial to evaluate the degree of possibility regarding such issues.</p>
<p>The issue is that we often fail to recognize that we may be very misled or deceived, even at the level of our deepest beliefs and assumptions about how the world functions. Without taking such a consideration into account, we are not open to the full spectrum of possibilities that may be taking place.</p>
<p>Within the locked box that is our worldview, held together by our assumptions and beliefs about reality, we have a very limited idea of what is truly taking place and are more often than not wrong in a multitude of ways.</p>
<p>When evaluating complex issues and phenomena such as corruption, we need to be very aware of the extent of our own ignorance regarding the subject. </p>
<p>The majority of us have been victims of propaganda since the early years of our lives and for the most part, have absolutely no clue the degree of influence it has had on us.</p>
<p>If there truly was corruption taking place, those engaging in it would be going about it in a manner that would not be easily understood by the masses and would not allow them to be privy to the information necessary to understand such a process. </p>
<p>If we use our own very limited frame of reference as the end-all-be-all method of evaluating whether complex phenomena are taking place, we would never even come close to understanding the actuality of the events occurring.</p>
<p>It is very important to continually evaluate our deepest and most firmly held beliefs and assumptions about reality, that way we can recognize deceit and falsehoods for what they are and make sure our perceptions have not been subtly manipulated by cunning external forces.</p>
<p>If we do not engage is such a practice and fail to realize the extent of our ignorance along with how many ways in which we may be being deceived, we will forever be slaves to our warped and misguided perceptions about reality.</p>
<p>The next time you go to dismiss something as being too “far out”, consider the extent of your own ignorance regarding the subject and seek to grow your knowledge pertaining to it beforehand in order to make a more rational and informed decision about it’s likelihood, along with evaluating your core beliefs and assumptions to make sure you are not an unknowing victim of propaganda or perceptual manipulation.</p></p>

        <p>I'm just looking at the statistics and the official data. Conclusions: old people are dying, especially those already past the expected living age. Most others who die were unhealthy to begin with. Some cases of long term complications are serious, but so far they don't justify anything. Asymptomatic spread is poorly understood and cannot be used to justify anything. And when you weigh all that in comparison to the proven consequences of long term lockdown, it's easy to see why the numbers don't add up. For many years I've wanted a great cleansing where we vanquish (for the lack of a better word) some of the weaker blood in our society as one of the things that is plaguing society and will continue to plague society are weak willed people and people who can't face death in old age with courage.</p>
<p>This has been way blown out of proportion by shit head dumb fuck asshole dumb shit fuck head journalists who commit de facto terrorism by spreading misinformation. People probably thought the bubonic plague was less serious than we think this disease is lol.</p>

        <p>Sounds like I’m reading a paragraph written by a psychopath “cleanse our society of weaker blood”. Why exactly do you want people to die? That is messed up.
Also because asymptomatic spreading is not understood and can’t justify any action taken to protect people? That makes no sense.
There are millions of people dead from this virus, this has not been blown out of proportion. Millions of people have died, who did not need to die.</p>

        <p>Millions of people have died because we have an unaddressed health problem which is a result of self-neglect and dieting myths. I'm not a psychopath. I feel deep empathy for people who are around me when their suffering is genuine. It just doesn't extend far beyond that. It's not tragic to me that old people are dying, nor is it tragic that unhealthy people are dying. Plus this is also an irrational anger. I have anger issues 100%.</p>

        <p>I'm watching Adam Curtis' new 6 part doc called 'Can't get you out of my head' in which he discusses the history of conspiracy theories and such like. Interesting stuff. </p>
<p>I've never seen myself as a conspiracy theorist but I have always questioned everything. So, if I ever call someone a sheep, it's because I believe they're following blindly along without questioning anything.</p>

        <p>I've been watching his docs for years and I'm pretty sure I've seen that one.
This new one popped up on BBC iplayer last week and I didn't know it was him but I was so happy when he started talking because you always know you're getting the real deal with him</p>
