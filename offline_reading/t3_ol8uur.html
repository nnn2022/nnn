    <strong>GameStop and AMC were shorted so heavily because of the lockdown forever plan and Global Reset.</strong>
    <p><p>Clothing companies would never fail because of trying on clothes.  Groceries would still be desired to be seen in person like fruits.  Stores like WalMart would survive because of being one stop shops for things things and more through essential stores where vaccination is mandatory. The general public easily gravitate towards the convenience of ordering things and doing "recreational" activities from their couch. </p>
<p>We continue to be subliminally programmed by the algorithms presented by the screens in front of us and our behaviors.  Even more accurate data is gathered by the increased screen time.</p>
<p>Get ready for the delta variant and whatever happens after that. AMC theaters will only allow vaccinated and be used by a larger corporation that'll build new stores.  GameStop will try to move online, and it's success will be determined by if becomes an gaming centered StockX/EBay.</p>
<p>Your stocks will be worth nil because of the reset that'll include a forced and tracked global currency that'll replace the highly inflated ones.</p></p>

        <p>You are absolutely unequivocally indescribably incorrect. The hedge funds shorted everything. They shorted clothing stores, retail stores, technology companies, entertainment businesses, literally fucking everything.</p>
<p>GME and AMC were the two that we caught on to. But there is also EXPR, NOK, BB, BBBY, KOSS, and they are all shorted the exact same way. Fuck, even Tootsie roll is shorted the same way. The hedge funds saw brick and mortar stores having difficulty in a pandemic and they chose to short them expecting that they would not have to close their positions. They wanted to put these companies out of business and into bankruptcy, the exact same way they did to Toys r us. </p>
<p>The hedge funds are evil in many ways but they are not a part of planning a great reset, they didn't have fore knowledge of any perpetual lockdowns. It simply amounts to they are greedy assholes and they are about to get what is coming to them. There are subs dedicated to those stocks and I suggest you spend a little bit more time in them than in the ones you have been in. Because it sounds like you are a shill for those hedge funds.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns in the future.  If many stages of lockdown are meant to take place, making money on the behavioral pattern shifts is the obvious focus.  2 that became impossible to bring back because of the conveniences of what was provided without leaving the home.</p>
<p>I observe and speak with many people that don't participate in many of the same recreational activities.  Patterns have shifted and there became easy targets and untouchables, with the amount of people that would've shrugged their shoulders at GameStop or AMC because of the scenario in place.  They were right there about to pull it off before the popularity of them trending began rising.</p>
