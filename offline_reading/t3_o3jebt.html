        <p>If you don't allow family inside, then you don't have to worry about them reporting the facility's neglect and i competence.  That's the main reason they make it so hard to visit.</p>
<p>Hospitals, doctor's offices, and vets did the same thing.  If you're not there, then there are no witnesses when they mess up or flat out don't do the services they're charging for.</p>

        <p>Bingo... It is much easier to trick family members into giving permission for things like ventilators and other invasive treatments if they cannot talk to their family member and realize "Okay... my mom/dad/uncle/aunt is still with it... why do I have to make medical decisions for them from 2 miles + away?"</p>
<p>That is exactly what they did with my mom. They tricked me into authorizing her to be put on a ventilator, knowing that I was tired from nearly 2 weeks of no sleep while taking care of mom 24/7.</p>

        <p>I am sorry you had to go through that, its insane, the medical establishment in general is often times nuts, when I was a teenager I was in a really bad accident, they had me on a high morphine drip, which I'm alergic to, makes me have pretty scary hallucinations, but instead of realizing that, they concluded I must be suicidal and tried to put me in an institution, thankfully my mom went apeshit and threatened to sue them, they then released me from the hospital, l can't even fathom the amount of hurt people have uncessarly been put through.</p>

        <p>This is the thing about this that upsets me the most. My parents were living in an assisted living facility when everything locked down. My dad was on hospice for heart failure, and suddenly overnight we were no longer allowed to go see my parents. It was his 84th birthday that week, and I wasn't allowed to go see him on his birthday. He was going downhill fast, because the one thing that brought him joy and a reason to continue living - seeing his family - was taken away from him. The assisted living facility didn't like that hospice was coming in daily, so they were about to push him out into a nursing home; a place not even my mom could go see him.  The last straw was when my dad called me late one night crying because he missed his kids so much. That was it, I knew what I had to do. I moved my parents into my home that weekend so that my dad could die surrounded by his family. </p>
<p>I think of all the elderly in those homes who suffered the isolation, loss of family, dying with nobody at their side, and it makes me sick.  What we did in the name of protecting our precious elders is unconscionable. We didn't save them, we convicted them to a life of isolation and lonely deaths. </p>
<p>For what it's worth, there was a covid outbreak in the building where my folks were living after I brought them home, and not one person died. So much for a death sentence for the elderly if they get sick. </p>
<p>This madness needs to end. These people need their loved ones and friends. Humans weren't meant to be alone like this.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you and your family had to go through that, but I'm glad you were able to get him out to be surrounded by loved ones, people need people, they need love, laughter, touch, taking away our only point to living is fu*king insanity</p>

        <p>I appreciate that. I am very grateful that I was in a position to do this. I know not everybody can, and their heartbreak must be huge. And you're right it is fucking insanity. How anybody thinks this is ok is beyond my ability to reason.</p>
