    <strong>Some perspective on mask usage in my state</strong>
    <p><p>I just wanted to share something that I don’t often see discussed here but it’s definitely a problem. </p>
<p>When it came out that health experts were recommending wearing two or more masks to prevent contracting/ spreading Covid, it of course alarmed me. But, not for the obvious reasons. Something I rarely see anyone bring up is just how filthy peoples masks are in public. </p>
<p>Seriously, next time you’re out, just pay attention to the state of people’s masks. I work in a retail setting and I would estimate about half of people I see have visible food, dirt, sweat, and general grime on their masks. My own manager will often eat food on the job and smear food on her masks like she’s Picasso and her mask is an art canvas. The problem with this that for them to be even remotely “effective”, they need to be sterile. Especially KN95’s which, because they’re expensive, people reuse so much that they probably have harmful bacteria breading on them. And it’s not just the lower economic class that does this. High risk elderly are some of the worse example. I’ve seen them come in with dirty socks on their face, thinking they’re helping save the world from Covid wearing the filthiest article of clothing I can think of. Additionally, people reuse disposable gloves which cause cross contamination and spread any virus that they might have picked up on them. They don’t clean their face shields either. </p>
<p>This brings me to my next point, wearing three masks and not cleaning them is a recipe for disaster. Breathing damp air onto three filthy masks for hours a day will cause a build up of bacteria and compromise your immune system. Or at worst, give you bacterial pneumonia and kill you.</p>
<p>https://cbs12.com/news/local/bacteria-is-growing-on-your-mask</p>
<p>“It's very common that we will eat and then put our mask back on and if we are sweating a little we are creating a really nice soup for this bacteria”</p>
<p>And this article was studying the effects of harmful bacteria wearing just one mask. Why don’t they tell us to keep the masks clean? Why don’t they tell us not to touch our face anymore? Do other viruses and bacteria not exist anymore now that Covid is a thing?</p></p>

        <p>This is certainly unsafe mask usage. I do believe that wearing a disposable surgical mask for the maximum of 3 hours and putting on a fresh one after does help with that when used under a cloth mask, but still cloth masks need to be washed daily and they are also only good for about 100 uses max as well. Hence why the double masking doesn’t bother me because I have been doing that for quite a while now in addition to a face shield. It’s the same thing with gloves, they are single use. Once you leave the place you were at with them on, throw them out. It seems that fewer people understand this than should...</p>

        <p>Because it looks clean and throwing them out for new ones would get expensive, so people reuse. Or they buy a cloth one and reuse that thinking cloth is as good as a surgical mask. Do you find you go through a lot of the disposable masks during the week?</p>

        <p>Honestly only when I work. I’ll typically burn 4 in a 12 hour shift. Other than that I’m at home only leaving for groceries which only requires me to burn one surgical mask and one pair of gloves. I have no other people in my life so I’m fortunate enough that I can avoid unnecessary travel and stops outside of my house. However considering the circumstances I could see this getting very expensive for those with families which is why I feel like these supplies should be supplied free of charge by the government and the plus would be that since they pay for them, they can mandate them and then we can start moving forward a little safer.</p>
