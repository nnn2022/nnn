    <strong>Anecdotes of loved ones dying from COVID 19 will not make me sympathetic to further restrictions on anyone's rights.</strong>
    <p><p>I am tired of people trying to justify more lockdowns, masks, and other restrictions just because someone they know or care about died from COVID. How does a random person (to me) dying from this virus make it right to destroy people's livelihoods and take away their rights? Is it real and serious? Of course. Is it sad someone died? Yes. But even if it was me, I would never advocate messing with the lives of people who had nothing to do with it. The "Coronabros" (copyright Clay Travis) never gave a damn about my life before, and in fact were probably making my life worse already with the idiots they were electing. Fuck them.</p></p>

        <p>I have no doubt there are people flat out lying. But then there is also this: all visitors have been banned from hospitals since this nonsense started. So some elderly person--perhaps with one foot already in the grave--goes to the hospital with a cough, fever, what have you. They are admitted into the hospital, and from that point on the family members <em>will never see them</em>. Then a week later they get the news from the hospital that their grandfather died 'from covid'. </p>
<p>Is that what actually killed them? Who the hell knows? Once the patient is admitted, the only thing you have to go on is what the hospital tells you. And the pro-lockdown bunch is by definition credulous with regard to anything coming from an authority figure, so they're not going to question anything the doctors tell them.</p>
<p>I believe one of the more subtle but essential pieces of this whole fraud is the banning of visitors from hospitals.</p>

        <p>The practice of denying fathers' the right to be present with their children, especially infants, whilst being in the hands of hospital workers behind closed doors is one of the least acknowledged and most egregious crimes related to this scamdemic.</p>
<p>My brother's one-year-old daughter came down with something and had a fever (not covid) and was brought to the hospital by him and his wife. He told me that he had to stay in the waiting room while only his wife could accompany being seen, y'know, cause protect-the-grandmas™. Apparently it didn't even bother him; I don't have children (thankfully) but I'd be destroying property or damaging humans if anyone ever tried that shit on me and my baby, wife present or not. It's despicable.</p>

        <p>Your brother is a fool. Sorry if that offends you. Not allowing loved ones to accompany each other in such a horrible place as a hospital is one of the most disgusting evils ever committed. It's so easy to be forced or coerced into unwanted treatments when alone and afraid. This is most certainly intentional and I too would be causing some damage if a loved one was held hostage inside a hospital by glorified butchers and drug-dealers arrogant enough to call themselves "healthcare" workers. Sorry to offend the very few good ones out there.</p>

        <p>....Really? <em>..That's</em> your reply?</p>
<p>First of all I didn't advocate anything, I simply expressed the tenacity I'd be willing to take it to if anyone tried doing something to my baby without me being able to oversee, make decisions, and make sure they don't do what I believe to be unnecessary or harmful.</p>
<p>Secondly, it's a felony to assault <em>anyone</em>, so not really sure what point you were trying to make.</p>
<p>Lastly, and most importantly, being that you brought up felonies...you know what a real felony is? A hospital enacting a contingency that if they are to treat your infant child, possibly for something life-threatening, you are to hand them over to be whisked away into some fucking back room to be done with as they please, without you being there. That's a felony. I stand by my statement, any responsible father would go through hell and high water to protect their child.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't be surprised. As you already know, there are multiple dimensions and reasons for the multitude of cons they perpetrate on us - for sure a part of this agenda is the annihilation of families and suppression of advocacy in general; These psychopaths want to exclusively be mother, father, brother, sister, lover, friend, etc.</p>

        <p>That's half of it. The other half is government kick backs from anything any everything labeled COVID. That's the first part of the pay check scheme. The second half is the government being in bed and subsidizing profits via direct business WITH big pharma and pushing needles because that can be a new revenue source.</p>
<p>It's business to business at this point; they don't need the slaves, we are now cattle to be tagged and used directly as medical collateral, instead of semi-war collateral.</p>

        <p>Yep, I suspect it is becoming common practice to slap the covid  label on people dying due to medical error now that visitors are prohibited from standing watch and keeping eyes on them at all times. Just run a covid test at 45 cycles, stamp it on the death certificate, and call it a day.</p>

        <p>Bingo. Look at the laws that state and federal government in the United States keep on trying to sneak through: Total and absolute immunity for any adverse reactions from CoVid-19.</p>
<p>Sounds like a nice way for hospitals to say "Whoops... your wifey had CoVid-19 and so did your daughter, now we don't have to pay for her birth injury and your wife's death!"</p>

        <p>These same people will also then push anti-capitalism narratives, which in reality is them conflating what their beloved government is doing via creating artificial monopolies that couldn't exist otherwise, then insisting the answer to that "capitalist corruption" is more of the same government.</p>

        <p>You'll notice that people that don't understand basic economics, or how money and incentive works in general, will almost always lean liberal and insist conspiracy doesn't exist and no doctor would ever, ever do this.</p>
<p>Then, they exemplify draconian traits in unconscious ways, while telling themselves "Since I wouldn't do this a doctor definitely wouldn't", all the time most certainly being capable of doing the same thing in the same position, denying it, and creating a paradigm based on contradiction and delusion.</p>

        <p>I would wager a big amount that a majority of these people don’t have children. Since having my own ive found that the louder you have to yell that you “totally care about other people and sacrifice for them!” The less you have ever actually known what doing that is or feels like. </p>
<p>Having kids teaches you that lesson quickly and completely. And you wouldn’t know the difference between that feeling, since you’ve never had it, and the obligation to post online that you totally feel it. </p>
<p>Not to mention these are also the same people, at least on my
Own life, who think their choice to never have children is noble because the world is such a horrible, over crowded place. </p>
<p>Maybe the truth is more about their character than it is about the state of the world. I sincerely hope those kids you mentioned and all the rest can resist the urge to forfeit their right to a fulfilling life - and stop questioning whether it has meaning. </p>
<p>And to all the “hashtag child free margaritas 4lyfe best choice ever! Ew breeders are selfish!” Folks out there feeling virtuous  for making your life entirely about gratifying yourself only - I wish you’d been around to tell your parents how much kids suck, and fuck you.</p>

        <p>Clearly you didn't read the explanation. Only one of them is mine. Also? You'd be surprised. I have a ridiculously well adjusted and healthy  home with fabulous parental support systems in place ...  which is why my child was able to come to me with her thoughts and concerns. And also why her friends have leaned on me for support. What we are doing as a society is ripping teenagers away from the social activities and emotional needs that they should be acquiring outside of the home.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. The CDC reported in September that 25% of young adults are having suicidal thoughts during this lockdown. 80% of students said the lockdowns have had negative effects on their mental health. You have to be an absolutely daft idiot to imagine that holding young people under house arrest while society is transformed into an authoritarian hellscape is not going to make people suicidal. Many doctors and nurses have reported that they are seeing twice or three times as many suicides as normal but because the government takes years to report suicide statistics, brainwashed sheep refuse to accept that these lockdowns are causing a huge epidemic of suicide.</p>

        <p>The idea that the increase in deaths due to suicide, homicide, and overdoses outnumber deaths due to COVID is batshit crazy. Yes, this is having a severe impact on mental health, but COVID deaths are an order of magnitude worse than any deaths related to lockdowns.</p>

        <p>The majority of covid deaths are medical malpractice or relabeling of deaths from other causes. The average age of covid death is the same as the average human lifespan. The elderly dying of a respiratory illness is not a tragedy, young people dying of suicide and overdoses is. Even if the statistics were true, which they are certainly not, it still doesn’t justify lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I am very sorry that this has been difficult on many people's mental health.  But I have teenagers.  Their school is virtual only and they are not seeing their friends.  They have struggled with anxiety in the past before the pandemic.  And they are doing fine now mentally because they know that their sacrifices have a greater purpose, and because they are still finding ways to spend their time, connect with friends, and have fun, while social distancing and wearing masks around other people.  I know there are no easy fixes for mental health challenges, but if their depression is caused by the situation, you can have a positive effect through your perspective on the pandemic.</p>

        <p>You are seriously stupid. Read the article again. And then understand what terms mean what. Median does not mean average, that would be Mean. So how about you show me the mean age of death.</p>
<p>Also, that doesn’t really mean shit, if the MEAN age is still approximately current life expectancy in the US, and a shit ton of 80-90+ year olds are dying that shifts the balance to a higher mean age.</p>
<p>How many young people are you ok with dying exactly? What’s your figure? Is it ok if a 25 year old with cancer dies because they had cancer so fuck em? </p>
<p>Or is there a set number of when we should take precautions?</p>
<p>I guess we shouldn’t change environmental policy because only a handful of people die from cancer caused by carcinogenic output?</p>
<p>I guess we shouldn’t change police policy because only a handful of people get executed by the cops?</p>
<p>God you people are idiots. And the burden of proof is on the person that makes the claim. </p>

        <p>“I mean the same logic could be applied here. If I am at risk for complications from covid, why do I give a shit if your 4 teenagers walk in front of a train?” </p>
<p>That last sentence specifically speaks volumes about you. Not caring about 4 kids taking their own lives? If you’re at risk, just stay home. Why should a random teenager be held responsible for your health? Your health is your responsibility, nobody else’s.</p>

        <p>Lmao, then it sounds like their mental health is THEIR responsibility and no one else’s?</p>
<p>You see here is what you don’t understand. I posted a hypothetical. Saying that if people ignore restrictions and cause disease/death they are responsible. I abide by restrictions because I don’t want to cause someone’s death or disease because I care about people as a whole. But literally everything you guys post around here is contradictory.</p>
<p>Ok, these kids mental health matter and they are being affected by the lockdown, but what about the mental health of someone going through chemo, or a transplant recipient, or an elderly person? Fuck them they should stay home and suffer from the same issues.</p>

        <p>Hahaha! It’s not like people who needed cancer treatment, transplants or elderly care mattered to you in the first place. Those kinds of care are all considered “elective” remember? As in “those can all be cancelled, and we don’t care who dies in the meantime”. What? Did you think we’d forget that little farce? </p>
<p>Good job you little rat, you swapped deaths for deaths. That’s all your precious restrictions managed to achieve. So you can stop pretending you care now. </p>
<p>And you should probably know something, one of the deaths you caused was a family member of mine. Denied cancer treatment and died prematurely, because as you lockdown supporters keep spouting “Only covid matters!!”. Congratulations, you have at least one person’s blood on your puny little claws.</p>

        <p>This is what happens when you create a society driven by social media "likes".</p>
<p>Virtue is cheap when it is someone else besides you paying the price for it. And it's super easy to push out some smarmy sob story to guilt-trip the sheep, pretend that you actually care about it, and paint anyone who disagrees as a heartless monster.</p>
<p>This disgusting trend of making a virtue out of cheap displays of public grief first started to rear its head with the death of Saint Diana The Princess Of Woke, and has become the norm with the growth of the internet.</p>

        <p>No. "With Covid" not "of Covid". Of the 40,000 "deaths" of those under the age of 65 - about 2,400 might actually have been "of Covid". And all of them, were dying anyway - and not in some "we're all dying one day" sense but dying right now, this year. </p>
<p>This is why when you look at the year's projected mortality figures, everywhere in the world, and compare them to the last 10 years - they don't stick out as a "disaster". Because there is no excess mortality. The people who died this year? They were going to die this year. Covid is not a hoax, it's just not as serious as people have been told. The numbers don't lie, the media does.</p>

        <p>I wanted to make a good-faith effort to see if what you were saying is true. If so, then I would need to re-evaluate my perspective on this pandemic, the lockdown, and our current approach.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/hiLAvMl">Here's the CDC mortality data</a> addressing excessive deaths this year.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, CDC data does not corroborate what you are claiming. 2020 is <strong>remarkably</strong> higher than any previous year. Suicide upticks, while serious, make up less than 5% of the increase compared to previous years.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the # of corona infections correlate quite cleanly with the number of deaths. At a very, very minimum, the number of <strong>excessive</strong> deaths (higher than the yearly average) is +7,000, even when accounting for suicides. The average gap is closer to +11,000 deaths.</p>
<p>Weird factoid, the number of car deaths is also quite below average, suggesting that the lockdown actually saved quite a few lives that would have otherwise ended in a car accident. This isn't meant to seriously suggest that we should lockdown forever, only to point out that the number of deaths this year is actually being dampened by that factor. It would be even higher than average.</p>

And they all died of <em>something</em> and the occasion caused grief for <em>somebody.</em> Allowing every aggrieved person to lobby for bans and restrictions based on personal hardship is a recipe for disaster.

        <p>I just don’t understand what life means to these people. Is breathing and eating the cutoff? Human lives should be so much more than that. It makes me wonder if these people value themselves very much. Maybe the years of being told there is no higher meaning to life and no discoveries to be made because it’s all been done... has made people intrinsically feel utterly worthless. </p>
<p>I don’t feel that way, and maybe that’s why I feel like so much is at stake and have already been taken away. There is an energy to being alive and to feeling real love for your yourself, your experiences, and ALWAYS knowing there’s
More to see, even on a block you’ve walked a million times. So when people ask why this stuff affects me... the barriers, the signage, the patronizing from every facet around me - I just have to look at them in disbelief. </p>

        <p>I have 2 family members who died from COVID-19, one was a distant relative who worked as a doctor, got the virus very early, and it seems he was killed after being badly intubated, against his will.</p>
<p>The other one was my uncle, who was one of the biggest and more fat persons I've ever known, and wasn't in very good shape, also was over 70 years old. The saddest thing of all is that my uncle was actually pretty scared of COVID, was extremely careful, didn't go anywhere, and he and his wife, both got it.</p>
<p>Also, I must point out, my uncle decided not to go to a hospital, after a bad experience early in when he got infected, in which they interrupted their treatment, even thou he was showing signs of getting better, because whatever drug they were using was "controversial" or some bullshit like that.</p>
<p>So he ended up dying in his home, without proper medical attention.</p>
<p>Here is the thing, if anything these cases from my family has made it very clear that what we are doing is not helping ANYONE, and if fact, we are just making things worse for everyone, including the so precious COVID patients.</p>
<p>It seems almost like they only care about the statistic they pose.</p>
<p>My uncle was a semi-famous TV actor, and most stories in the newspapers about his death were with the headline "****** dies from COVID", as if all of his accomplishments, all of his life, everything was reduced to the fact that in death, he died with COVID.</p>
<p>It is completely sickening, and a bad joke on everyone who has been an actual victim of this pandemic.</p>

        <p>The majority of covid deaths in the US are medical malpractice. Government protocols that required intubation meanwhile banning super effective treatments like hydroxycloroqine, ivermectin and vitamin D infusions. The medical system has been an abysmal and bloody failure meanwhile they are being worshipped like heroes and eating it up.</p>

        <p>The global IFR is somewhere between <a href="https://swprs.org/studies-on-covid-19-lethality/">0.1 and 0.5%</a>.</p>
<p>The most recent of those studies is from John Ioannidis who recently settled on a global IFR of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.13423">0.15-0.20% overall and 0.03-0.04% for those &lt;70 years old</a>.</p>
<p>If you prefer the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html">CDC</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0-19 years: 0.003%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20-49 years: 0.02%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>50-69 years: 0.5%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>70+ years: 5.4%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/05/who-10percent-of-worlds-people-may-have-been-infected-with-virus-.html">WHO</a> also recently estimated that 10% of the global population may have already had COVID, which at the time would've implied an IFR of 0.13%.</p>

        <p>I mean having consensual sex while knowingly infected with HIV is a crime. Isn’t that pretty authoritative? Why should HIV positive people have to disclose their status? Shouldn’t people be able to fuck who they want to fuck? Why is the government interjecting themselves into people’s private business. If you fuck someone you know their is a risk they carry an STD, why is it the governments business? Shouldn’t you take personal responsibility for having sex?</p>
<p>So yes, authoritarian action has been taken to stop the spread of AIDS.</p>

        <p>Passing law which applies direct legal penalties for individuals who KNOWINGLY have a very good chance of passing on an extremely lethal virus by having sex with other people who have not consented to knowledge of the virus isn't authoritarianism; that's like saying laws against manslaughter are authoritarian.</p>
<p>Taking widespread and essentially absolute measures against an entire population regardless of whether individuals are infected or not is textbook authoritarianism, especially when it's a small percentage of the population who is actually infected by a virus which offers no more than a .5% threat of death over maybe a couple weeks to the majority of individuals.</p>

        <p>This is a really great post. When I lost a parent there were so many people I'd considered friends that suddenly had no need to reach out and ask me how I am doing. These were LIFE LONG FRIENDS. I'm not some 50 year old where it's common to lose your parents. I was a young guy and it was really horrific. They all knew what the situation was.</p>
<p>Now? They're still on their social media telling everyone that "just one life matters! SO WEAR YOUR FUCKING MASK!". I think it's a good thing, really. It shows you who they are at the core.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry, man.  Experienced the exact same thing. One of my friends even decided to take that moment to send me an email about all the things I did/bad habits I had and “I know this is awful timing and I am truly sorry but I have to be true to myself” and then cut me off and blocked me. True story. My faith in humanity has never been lower.</p>

        <p>most of the anecdotal crap is lies anyway, the pcr test is not fit for purpose there is no proof anyone is dying from covid simple as that.
and even if it was all totally true still does not in any way justify setting the constitution on fire and putting a population on house arrest or any of the crap they have done in the name of this scam.</p>

        <p>A lot people profess that they didn't care until someone they knew died with Covid. Like somehow knowing someone who died changes anything. Just because you know someone's grandma that tested positive before dying does not become irrefutable proof that we need lockdowns and masks. The gradual dumbing down of society has been successfully carried out.</p>

        <p>Completely agreed. Some of these people are being lied to about the cause of death of their family member. I'm waiting for a death certificate to come back right now from a relative who died. I'm fully expecting it to say covid, even though that wasn't the cause. For every sad death story there's dozens of  stories about someone who couldn't get a life saving surgery, someone who committed suicide because they don't wanna live in the NN, someone who couldn't spend the last moments of their dying family members because of no visitor rules in nursing homes, etc.</p>

        <p>I agree. 
I have this theory that people deep down, primally, KNOW this is distinctly out of everyones control. However, especially those prone to anxiety or hysteria, think "if we just did [authoritarian measure here] more or harder...all would be normal again!". So instead "accepting the things we can't control" they are really demanding more control from their leaders. The comments get more psychopathic by the day, in another sub, a doctor is actually suggesting anyone who forgoes this ridiculous vaccine should be denied a ventilator should they get sick later - as if that's out of care and compassion for human life, when it really sounds straight out a nazi handbook.</p>

        <p>I’m fucking exhausted. My roommate woke up Saturday with a fever and a cough. She hasn’t been tested yet. Because of this, I can’t work two days this week (I took 2 days vacation before Christmas) and my employer is only offering half pay for “covid related absences”. I’m just really frustrated with everything. Honestly what’s the point anymore? I started a new job, broke up with my boyfriend, had to move out of our house (and I thought he was my forever), and I have to live every day under this bullshit pandemic. I’m so tired.</p>

        <p>My feeling on it is why didn't they get treated when they first felt sick??  If you go to the doctor there's a very good chance you don't have to die from it.  Plus I also believe the fudge the numbers too.</p>

        <p>Someone mentioned it earlier in the thread, but one of the worst (and least discussed) things that occurred in the name of Almighty Covid was shutting loved ones out of hospital rooms and care facilities. That not only opened the door to all manner of medical cover-ups, it likely deeply traumatized the loved ones left behind (not to mention the person dying) to the point it could likely have caused PTSD. Also, no proper funerals was a nice little icing on the cake. </p>
<p>All around the country, we’ve got people who are likely fucked permanently in the head over to having a loved one die in this manner. And if they believe that traumatic death was Covid-related then of course they’re going to be angry and lashing out like a psycho. </p>
<p>The overall effect basically splits the survivors into 2 categories: unhinged psycho warriors for Covid or people who are so sad and defeated by this unnecessary evil that they’re mentally crippled.</p>
<p>Our whole nation, now, has been mentally crippled to some degree. Way to keep your population functional and in fighting form. (Oh, wait.....)</p>

        <p>The only person I kinda know that tested positive fo COVID and actually had symptoms had pre-existing conditions (sickly child) and still survived.</p>
<p>According to my aunt, who lies so much I’m not sure if I can trust her on this, my uncle tested positive (despite having no symptoms) So they may not even visit for Christmas this year. I can’t even be sure he even tested positive because my aunt lies every time she just doesn’t want to come over one way or another. Still this would be another level for her so oddly enough I’m thinking she better be telling the truth.</p>
<p>Last thing I want to say, when ever people say that, especially online, well first of all it’s easy to lie online. Second like how do they know the relaltive their talking about actually had or died of COVID? Not saying for sure they didn’t for people who have had this happen, but how do they know it wasn’t a lung problem or any other number of complications falsely labeled as COVID? Just asking how they can know for sure.</p>

        <p>Except nobody here is flailing arms. We're all doing perfectly ordinary things like working, socializing, and buying groceries. If you can't do those things without turning it into some strange ritual, that's your problem, not everybody else's. If you're not comfortable walking into a grocery store, don't walk in. Go home and type one of the dozens of delivery services into your little cellphone app. If you're worried about your health, make the appropriate lifestyle improvements. We are not asking you for any sort of accomodations or concessions. In fact we would prefer if you lived your life without involving us at all.

<p>Opinion discarded. Don't talk like a Redditor. A first-year English writing professor would throw your piece in the garbage over this. Hold yourself to a higher standard.</p>
<p>You and I and everyone else has gone out in public and gone to work and bought groceries and seen friends and otherwise lived normally while we had the flu, what changed? Everything is potentially deadly to somebody; it's no-one's fault if and when that somebody catches that something and it's completely absurd to suggest it's possible for everyone to live in such a way that could prevent everyone from ever catching that anything. Virus eradication is a fool's errand. Even totalitarian dreamworlds like Australia where the police arrest people for being outside have had case counts resurge. It's a useless project and the costs outweigh the benefits. We have to learn to live with the virus and individuals if they don't want to get sick should make the appropriate lifestyle changes to improve their health. Locking yourself indoors and walking around with your face covered to avoid catching a common flu bug is pathetic. If corona is something that can fuck your shit, you are weak. This isn't a value judgement, even though most weak people have become weak through neglect of their bodies, it's an amoral biological fact. Biology doesn't care about your false compassion bud.</p>

        <p>No, it's not. It's an analogy demonstrating an extreme to better illustrate the point; comparing one infectious disease and one selfish person's actions, causing an active danger to others. I mean, if you don't want typhoid, just don't go anywhere.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, no matter how many comparisons or analogies anyone makes, if you refuse to engage in basic mitigation measures like wearing a mask and not being crowded around other people...You are being selfish at the risk of others' health, solely because you are incapable of inconveniencing yourself for the benefit of others and society.</p>

        <p>My community is the people around me I care about. My son who makes dramatic speeches about suicide because he has no idea whether he'll be allowed to see his friends at school from week to week. My daughter who can't network with her university peers in her final year in a hands-on field. My wife whose boss interrogates her constantly about her personal life and who has consulted fucking lawyers to try to force her to stop going to the gym. Her parents who get threatened with incarceration every time they exercise their full legal right to visit their Florida property. The local businesses I frequent who are scared ragged that at any time they'll be ordered to close, and face arrest and a criminal record if they defy the orders, and they've got fuck all in terms of assistance because all their former employees are sissy-ass doomers and it's just them 7 days a week 10 hours a day doors open to keep the lights on.  The trainers at my gym - they're unemployed. But thanks to the rules they can't collect Employment  Insurance, because every month or two we get a golden week where gyms are allowed once again under onerous restrictions to once again shutter because muh case count. Servers at restaurants I used to frequent - same shit. They're hosed too. Because they rely mostly on tips and it's irregular income they can't report for EI. My 6-month-old niece hasn't played with other babies since August. Her mother is going stir crazy from only seeing visiting family instead of other moms at the group, and my brother has regressing into his alcoholism now that he's freshly unemployed, once again. I gotta come over to help my sister-in-law with the diaper changes and his stupid ranting about masks and social distancing and it causes tension because I'm fitter and more put together than my skinnyfat slob brother and his ugly wife obviously wants my dick.</p>

        <p>Is it easier to sit in a chair all day or run a 5k? Which is healthier? But I get it your right... I remember all those stories about surgeons and nurses dying from being uncomfortable during hours long surgeries so it’s totally justifiable that you don’t want to wear a mask inside the grocer for 20 minutes.</p>

        <p>Hilarious. Crazy how we are still Around 200k cases per day and most people are masked Almost as if a fucking piece of cloth can't stop this thing 🤔
. Also I feel bad for your daughter I bet you didn't even let her play outside with her friends this past summer because it's #OperationSaveGrandma 💪 I do wish she was older and saw how crazy you are</p>

        <p>Man it’s hard to decide which one of you idiots to reply to first since, as mentioned earlier, this sub will only let me reply once every 15 minutes. </p>
<p>Which is it you fucking idiot? </p>
<p>Do I keep her home schooled and sequestered from her friends as you say that is so harmful? Or do I abide my mask orders to allow her to return to in person schooling?</p>
<p>Are you this fucking stupid that you cannot see how many people wear a mask to the grocery store and then go to large gatherings and don’t wear masks because they are with friends?</p>
<p>Is it hard being this dumb? I genuinely want to know.</p>

        <p>No you should not be abiding by the mask orders. I bet you didn't even let your little girl go to a park this past summer. I say set up PlayDates with her friends because now it is winter and you can't really go outside. Not much socialization going on in the schools btw they all have to be 6ft away and on Chromebooks (At least where I live in NY) Yeah alot of socialization going on there making them sit in Hula hoops 6ft apart. Grow a fucking brain dude Hilarious how you mention Maskless Gatherings Like your Boy Gavin Newsom didn't have a Whole fucking Dinner with people and Other democrat officials are getting caught breaking their own rules.</p>

        <p>Wow. This is special. </p>
<p>So don’t abide by mask order = daughter is stuck home schooling.</p>
<p>I don’t live in NY so that irrelevant. Believe it or not there are multiple states in this country with different regulations, at least 50 if you can believe that!</p>
<p>Too bad they still have recess and Gym class where they are out doors and playing.</p>
<p>And what the fuck do I care about Newsom, do you think I am defending anyone? What the fuck do I care what people do because of political affiliation?</p>
<p>Are you assuming my political affiliation? </p>
<p>Do you know anything about me? Do you know anything about our restrictions in Ohio? Do you know that I would rather have my daughter socialize with her friends at school even through a mask then have her stuck at home while I alternate teaching her myself and working?</p>
<p>It seems like you made a lot of assumptions here. </p>
<p>Hell you are assuming I didn’t let her go to a park over the summer? Where are you even getting this from? Are you a child? Is this projection because mommy wouldn’t let you play outside this summer?</p>

<p>You definitely have it harder than juniors and seniors, and younger students older siblings being shipped off to WW1, WW2, and Vietnam.</p>

        <p>What an interesting point no one else has made.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a real life situation. </p>
<p>I have two options where I live. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Send my daughter to school in a mask where she has direct instruction from her teacher and social interaction with her friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep here as an only child, and as a single parent that works full time and try and teach her myself while also working, and giving her virtually no chance to have social interaction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Also you really some how think that carbon dioxide will not diffuse through a cloth mask? </p>
<p>So option 1 you seem to think is going to hinder her development by forcing her to breathe in more carbon dioxide, and option 2 would completely cut off a 6 year old from face-to-face human interaction. Which do you think is the better option? And these are the two options so pick one.</p>

        <p>You can use your big boy voice and speak out against ridiculous mandates and how they’ve been/continue to push the goal posts. </p>
<p>And the carbon dioxide/oxygen argument I inserted goes both ways (even though you only included CO^2 in your counter argument, I know what you meant). I’m not saying it <em>doesn’t</em> diffuse, I’m saying you will get <strong>less</strong> oxygen and <strong>more</strong> carbon dioxide, which generally speaking is not a good thing. Hence why so many people are passing out or developing infections at the worst and at the best are a little light-headed or getting headaches. But the cherry on top is that they are forcing compliance and getting no kickback. That is the problem.</p>
