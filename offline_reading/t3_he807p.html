        <p>Interesting to see concern from a medical journal about this, really makes me wonder how much of the medical field actually advocates all the new normal shit we’ve been seeing, after all most of the “public health experts” who advocate for it are either not doctors or haven’t seen a patient or submitted a peer reviewed paper in years.</p>

        <p>Yes I am a doctor and don’t know any other physicians who advocate any of this public health stuff beyond a few completely reasonable social-distancing measures. There’s a big difference between the public health people (mostly ivory tower academics) and doctors (who see actual patients and understand human health on a much more practical level).</p>
<p>Speaking generally, doctors focus on an patient’s overall wellbeing. There has been a huge push towards a more holistic approach to healthcare in medical education the past 20 years. </p>
<p>Additionally, doctors at least for the past 50 years have held a strong belief in the autonomy of individuals to make their own informed choices about their own health. That’s why informed consent is a thing now- used to be paternalism “doctor knows best.” It turns out people are typically better off doing what they know is in their best interest, as long as they are reasonably informed about the consequences of their actions. </p>
<p>Public health people seem to focus on one problem at a time (deaths from one specific disease process) and these blinders make them unable to see the big picture (the thousands of other ways a human being can die or be made miserable to the point where life is no longer worth living). They believe they can institute rules across society to fight specific disease processes. </p>
<p>Doctors generally don’t make these sorts of rules, especially when there are such vast social and economic consequences at stake, of which we have only secondary interest and no expertise. In my view, politicians and public health “experts” are the ones responsible for the terrible predicament we are in now.</p>

<p>I’d take it a step further and say public health officials <em>are</em> politicians first and foremost and will act like politicians.</p>

        <p>Hey, I have an MPH and I think the response is horrific.  A well trained public health official will look at the full scope of impact from both the pandemic and the response.  My first thoughts upon shutting down were that basic needs would not be met, that social isolation leads to poorer health outcomes, that safety and mental health would be at risk, and that this would be disastrous for our healthcare in terms of delayed services.</p>
<p>The issue is that politicians want lap dogs who support their political agenda.  Right now the world has no tolerance for dissenting voices.  I am ashamed of the "experts" in my field who have contributed to this shitshow and alienated completely from the public health community.  </p>
<p>I do find people who actually work in healthcare to be a lot more reasonable, but there are a few people who buy into the hysteria.  There are definitely a handful who need to rethink their careers if they are so fucking scared of this virus.  I can't imagine the things they are exposed to on a daily basis and yet they are freaking out over COVID-19.</p>

        <p>A lot of it is probably, like everything else, the silent majority. </p>
<p>&rt;after all most of the “public health experts” who advocate for it are either not doctors, <strong>are not versed in the field of epidemiology</strong>, or haven’t seen a patient or submitted a peer reviewed paper in years.</p>
<p>Sorry, correcting that.</p>
