    <strong>People keep saying we need universal health care during this covid outbreak</strong>
    <p><p>Canadians what is the reality of your universal health care? I heard it doesn’t even cover everything. If the US was to follow do we think our health care quality would decline?</p></p>

        <p>Our taxes are pretty damn high, everything is covered except dental, prescriptions and extras like Chiro, eye exams, physio ect. You can walk into any walk in clinic in any part of Canada or ER and be seen at no cost. It’s nice that if I contracted a serious illness or disease I also won’t go bankrupt but as a result waits for things like MRIs, certain ultrasounds or specialist doctors can in some cases be over a year wait list. There are certain private sectors that are much quicker but you pay out of pocket or through private insurance through work, if your job provides and in those cases the healthcare premiums are very reasonable, well for myself anyways. This is my experience as a Canadian.</p>

        <p>U.K. has universal health care, it’s not great but it’s not shit either, it’s treated like a religion by the masses :/.</p>
<p>The thing is private health care is still available for those who can afford it and the outcomes are way better. But universal health care is always a good thing it’s a safety net for those who can’t afford to pay. </p>
<p>I’ve cut myself with a chainsaw and was seen and put back together in 30 minutes.
I’ve broken my arm and was seen and dealt with within an hour all at no cost other than from taxes. If you are against universal health care I can’t understand it. The private model is always there if that’s what you prefer.</p>

        <p>From Canada and I can say it pretty much does cover everything. My husband has had a cryptogenic stroke where he stayed in hospital for 5 days and met with every specialist doing every test there is. Cost=$0.
He also had a tumor inside his spinal cord which he had removed and spent a month in the hospital. Cost=$0. The only thing not covered is prescriptions, and dental. If you have a dentsl emergency though the hospital will take care of you for free (ex. If you have to have a tooth removed due to infection).</p>

        <p>What about vision and mental health? I just saw a tweet from a Canadian follower claiming it’s not covered.</p>

        <p>Vision is not covered if you say want an eye exam or prescription lenses those will cost you, but are covered under the most basic health care plans through mkst workplaces. If you damage your eyes of need medical attention to then, that does not cost.</p>
<p>Mental health is covered mostly with a referral. For therapeutic services it does incur cost if you just want a general counsellor. But with a doctors referral, also free, you can see a psychiatrist or other clinician absolutely free. We have a bunch of mental health facilities and none of their programs cost a dime to the person.</p>
<p>Even dermatology is free.</p>

        <p>I  think there’s mental health coverage available or at a very reduced cost, again if you have coverage through private insurance you get a certain amount. Vision, I’m pretty sure isn’t covered or maybe it’s like a eye exam every few years. Something like that.</p>
