    <strong>Confusion</strong>
    <p><p>People have different opinions, and that's okay. That is when discussions and arguments happen. An opinion can be subjective or objective. Such as the opinion on a machine's capability at preforming a task. I find that arguments should be to learn and find the truth of the matter using evidence and an attempt at understanding the other person. So I request that you allow me to genuinely question and understand this community. </p>
<p>If this post gets deleted or I get restricted from posting I am going to assume you all insane because you can't ask people to understand you then not let them. Also, from what I noticed you guys don't like the oppression of your rights from masks and lock down and such, so don't be hypocritical and restrict my rights on this subreddit in an attempt to learn. </p>
<p>I am what you call an ignorant-close minded sheep. You are to society an uneducated circlejerk of falsehoods. You guys might want to work on your PR, I hope to help with that. Because no matter how stupid I might think you or you think I might be, we are all people who have reasons for our understanding and actions. </p>
<p>First question: It seems you guys don't like vaccines, though I could be wrong in that. If you guys don't like the oppression of lockdown and masks, why don't you like vaccines which aim to get rid of that restriction? If people are vaccinated, then people don't need to be locked in quarantine. Just looking at other countries like Australia and Norwegian countries that have quarantined or gotten vaccinated, they are incredibly better off than America. What do you guys have to say about that?</p></p>

<p>There is no connection between covid-19 and restrictions. covid-19 doesn't cause restrictions. This also means the absence of covid-19 doesn't end restrictions.</p>
<p>Restrictions are created by lockdownist regimes. What gets rid of restrictions is the removal of lockdownists from power.</p>

        <p>Okay so lockdowns around the world were caused because politicians everywhere wanted a stronger regime? Lockdowns were proven effective in smaller countries as many were able to continue living there lives. New Zealand was able to turn Covid around by lockdown. Also, I think that the idea of a lockdown coming from a goal of governmental oppression doesn't hold gravity as there is quite a lot of scientific data on how it is effective. I don't think you can deny an entire country getting rid of covid. </p>
<p>Covid caused restrictions to keep people safe. You say covid didn't cause restrictions but was caused by regimes and that getting rid of covid doesn't rid of restrictions, but you should look at places like Australia that can go to full sized baseball game without a mask and at max capacity because they got rid of Covid</p>

        <p>Did you just ignore the last part of OP's post? Places like Australia had lockdowns, but they're over. Shit has been normal for the best part of a year, we're not all still stuck in our homes. 'Cause once there are no confirmed cases, shit goes back to normal. It's almost like the local governments want to avoid economic collapse!</p>
<p>No, what gets rid of restrictions is the containment of the virus. Fuck your conspiracy rhetoric, places like where I live have shown that things will go back to normal.</p>

        <p>Maybe things are worse where you are, but on the whole lockdowns are not a human rights violation, they're a necessary measure for reducing the spread.</p>
<p>Maybe you wouldn't have to worry about lockdowns if you went and lived off-grid, but since you're in a society along with other people, sometimes you gotta do what's right to help protect them too.</p>

        <p>My point is that it is proven effective and safe, and when it's not you can't get it. If you are a kid or if you are pregnant you can't get it until it is proven safe for them, but everyone else it has been proven safe.</p>

        <p>You really think it was a short time frame? With the amount of time we have all spent in lockdown that we all complain about it's remarkable that people now say testing hasn't gone on long enough. There aren't going to be long term effects to a vaccine like that. The vaccine takes effect to make your body immune. Scientists can detect when the body does something different and they did. It is safe, that's why we get it. If you can find cases of the first people getting the shot now suffering extreme side effects then please tell me.</p>

        <p>First don’t come here calling us names while expecting to be welcomed with open arms that’s just counter productive to your stated purpose.
I’m not anti vaccine I just choose not to be part of the test group. Once it’s been around for a few years and science has given us a better understanding of the long term health effects I may very well decide to take it.  The last time I was given an experimental vaccine by the government was the 90’s, anyone remember the Anthrax vaccine? Doctors now believe that the vaccine cocktails the military gave us prior to deployment contributed to Gulf War Syndrome but they didn’t know that at the time they just wanted everyone vaccinated just in case.</p>

        <p>My point with the insults was that people don't like you and that you don't like me. I insulted myself and I insulted you for the sole purpose to express my understanding on both sides. </p>
<p>I half agree with you. The vaccine has been tested, that's why we can get it. Example, an average adult male or female can get a vaccine, but you know who can't? Children and pregnant women because it HASN'T been tested on them, the scientists don't know if it's safe.  </p>
<p>I understand government skepticism when it comes to their past mistakes, but that mistake happened and won't ever happen again, especially with more vaccines and public company creation of the vaccine. No company would release a faulty vaccine just because of how capitalism works.</p>

        <p>Sorry Steve but the vaccine has not been fully tested which is why it hasn’t received full authorization for use from the FDA. Right not they are still being administered under conditional use authorizations. To be full tested will take years of study and thousands of test subjects. Which is what they’re doing now with vaccine volunteers such as yourself.</p>

        <p>I personally am not anti-vaccine. I have been fully vaccinated. What ticks me off about the whole thing is that I still have to wear a mask even though I did this. What ticks me off is that they have put the entire country into lockdown after lockdown for a virus with a 99%+ survival rate at the expense of our economy and people’s mental well being. None of this was necessary and the fact that it has been over a year is ridiculous. It’s never going to go away. New strain after new strain is going to emerge, so do you propose we live in this state for the rest of time? I find it sad that you’ve been to scared to see your people in person. Glad I don’t have that problem.</p>

        <p>We won't have to live like this forever. If people were educated from the beginning the country could have been in lockdown for much less of a year with much less consequences. I am glad you got your vaccine, but you have to understand that it will only be the most useful when everyone gets it. Covid is incredibly contagious, more than the flu and we get flu shots every year. The way the world works is that we have to compromise, and if people are smart the most we will ever have to sacrifice is a Covid shot annually just like the flu shot. We are only living in this time because of people denying the effectiveness of lockdown and such, which is proven effective: look at New Zealand for example and many other countries.</p>

        <p>I really do understand your point. What SHOULD have happened when this first broke was that we should have gone into an absolute lockdown for 2 weeks or so. Everyone should have been paid their regular salary during that time without having to use vacation time. With maybe a little extra as incentive to stay home. I think in that case most people would have been ok with that for a 2 week period. But the fact is that they didn’t and with all the conflicting media coverage and recommendations being thrown around people got angry. And now we’re over a year in and we’re tired of it. At this point it’s past fixing. Yeah, I know supposedly once enough people are vaccinated things should theoretically go back to normal. But I and a lot of other people are skeptical that that’s actually ever going to happen. Once the government gets too much control I feel they’re going to be reluctant to give it up. That’s just my take.</p>

        <p>Alright let's get this over with. I'm sorry most people in this sub are being shitty to you. But that's gonna happen. Society thought it was a good idea to try to get mob mentality to get everyone vaccinated. So the people here are....irritated to say the least. Because going against the mob, ain't too pleasant an experience in 2021.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don't trust Biden nor Trump nor Pfizer nor J&amp;J. Imagine me not trusting shady governments and businesses. And so since I understand that it's an mRNA vaccine, I simply don't feel comfortable to give them admin access to my ribosomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This vaccine hasn't been studied well enough nor long enough for my liking. Simple as that. Give it a few years. Well see.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's just the constant shaming of people. Like people here are assholes sure, but DAYUM what the hell people on your side can't even question the government nor big pharma anymore. Nor should they, since they gave over admin access to their cellular metabolism over to big pharma. They shouldn't have that right. You can either be a sheep and ignore the slaughterhouse. Or you can simply get up and leave. But complaining about the slaughterhouse, and still doing everything the farmer tells you, is nonsensical.</p>

        <p>I am sorry but what is wrong with you. Why do people so carelessly detest the life of others. I don't care what reason you have to throw away the lives of others, whether it be anti covid or what have you. You and no one else has the right to take another person's life. Everyone has value in life, if you only live to throw  another person's life maybe find another way to live. You don't see me here actively saying people should die. You are disgusting not because of your views on Covid but for the simple fact that you deny humanity.</p>

        <p>Well here I am living in a city where lockdowns have only happened twice and for no more than a week each time. Aside from that, we're all perfectly free to go anywhere (domestically) and do whatever we want. </p>
<p>Why's this "mass arbitrary imprisonment" not happening to me? Probably because our state government did a good job of implementing helpful measures to contain the confirmed cases before they could spread.</p>
<p>Probably because when we were told to wear our masks and stay indoors, we did. Then we saw the fruits of those things, because it contained the virus and we could go back to normal. </p>

        <p>Yes, because they make no sense - my immediate family and a number of close friend agree with me. I'm the only one that was ill with the Kung Flu, and, to be honest, I had worse hangovers in my student days.</p>
<p>Where I've had to give details to get into a shop or whatever, I've invented a phone number using the standard UK mobile template 07-XXX-XXX-XXX, and have had various names. My mobile, of course, stays at home, so the carrier logs (if checked) will show that that's where it was. I do not shop anywhere that doesn't take cash, unless it's a delivery to my home.</p>
<p>I don't even own a mask (the government generously provided a mask exemption badge which was free and which anybody can access), and I won't be getting a jab.</p>

        <p>Your “confusion” and our dissent is all by design. There is enough information (true or not) on either side of the fence to  stand firmly upon. It’s not an accident, and it’s definitely not scientific.</p>

        <p>I'm actually amazed at how limp-wristed the people in this sub are. I was expecting a more intense fight, but instead it's just disenfranchised, conspiracy-filled idiots who are lacking in basic critical thinking skills. Fuck this place, I'd leave but it's such a good source of entertainment.</p>
