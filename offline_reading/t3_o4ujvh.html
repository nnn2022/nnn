    <strong>A short story that hopefully fills some of you with hope.</strong>
    <p><p>Last weekend I attended a local fair. 99.99% of people did not wear masks. There was this make shift “booth” outside of the fair with two hysterical women with boxes of masks, they were begging people to wear masks, and offering people money if they kept their masks on the entire time they were at the fair. The greatest part was that everyone passing them either laughed in their faces or told them they were crazy. I stopped for a few minutes to watch what people would do. These 2 women were disgusting. They tried to coerce elderly people into thinking that they had to wear masks if they wanted to enter. These 2 were not supposed to be there as I reported them to the fair workers and they told me that since they were outside of the main gate they could not ask them to leave unless they caused a physical disturbance. Eventually, they gave up because I think they got the feeling that everyone was pissed off at their presence. This fair was in a small town out in the country and these 2 women very clearly came from the city to try to force their way in to our business. But my local community came through and made it clear we wanted them gone. I’m glad people are waking up.</p></p>

        <p>NICE!</p>
<p>I was travelling by train a bit this year. We have mandatory ffp2 inside the trains. First time I traveled, I was surprised, quite a bunch of people with only ffp1.</p>
<p>So, I switched aswell and just have it under the chin in case.</p>
<p>Just 2 days ago, I was going through the train and like 75% were not wearing their masks properly. Especially the younger ones, whom I considered a lost cause were maskless.</p>
<p>What a joy.</p>

        <p>My mom just came to visit over Memorial Day - we've been trying to get her out of her little bubble of fear and sadness since last summer.</p>
<p>On her way out here, she said "I wish you were vaccinated. I hope it's okay that I'll wear a mask everywhere. I'm just so scared." Sure, ma, you do whatever you want.</p>
<p>We went to dinner that night, she wore a mask into the restaurant. That was the last time she wore it for the whole long weekend.</p>

<p>In Canada, we should have fully vaccinated people wearing masks outdoors.  It's mind-boggling.</p>

        <p>If you live in any state where you're already "allowed" to do everything, this is meaningless. There's a good chance everyone not caring is because the collective opinion went from "they said we have to" to "they said we don't have to" instead of anyone actually developing some original thinking.</p>
