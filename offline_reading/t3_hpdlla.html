        <p>Not really. I’ve already seen it all over the internet. Private business owners do have the right to impose rules at their stores &amp; it’s rude to yell at employees. I still think the “new normal” bullshit is crazy but I’m generally polite and I know the law. Thanks anyway! Have a nice day.</p>

        <p>It's appreciated that you aren't someone who argues with the policies of private businesses. I am curious though as to what is crazy about the new normal. I feel as though it is a good medium between those who refuse to leave the house out of fear and those who wish to pretend that everything is fine when it isn't.</p>

        <p>I could write an entire book about it. But I’ll try to be brief. First, I think that catch phrases, in general, do not appeal to me as a logical person who operates on facts and reason. The catch phrase “new normal” also implies no end in sight. Second, most people are wearing cloth-based masks that have little to no effectiveness. If we’re required to wear masks, then masks that actually work should be available to the public (they’re not). Third, it is apparent that this disease inordinately affects the elderly. Many people are misinformed as to the actual risk to younger people like myself (in my thirties). The elderly and at risk can be protected without destroying our economy and causing long-lasting socioeconomic issues (and consequential deaths). Fourth, the media has been engaging in widespread fear mongering and I have been able to identify lies or misinformation in virtually every news article that I’ve read with about an hour of research and critical thinking. Fifth, those promoting these measures really upon “science” but fail to identify the science that supports it. They reject any science that fails to support their presuppositions without even considering the opposing science’s validity, which in my view is actually anti-science. Finally, I value my freedom. I think those taking it away from me should at a minimum be required to provide a rational basis for doing so and yelling “stay the f#%^ home” is unpersuasive to me.</p>

        <p>I’d like to add a quote from Lord Sumption in the UK: 
“ What sort of life do we think we are protecting? There is more to life than the avoidance of death. Life is a drink with friends. Life is a crowded football match or a live concert. Life is a family celebration with children and grandchildren. Life is companionship, an arm around one’s back, laughter or tears shared at less than two metres. These things are not just optional extras. They are life itself. They are fundamental to our humanity, to our existence as social beings. Of course death is permanent, whereas joy may be temporarily suspended. But the force of that point depends on how temporary it really is.”</p>

        <p>I’m sure if lame pics like this that have been reposted 1000x all over the internet impacted us, we’d probably be on your side already. </p>
<p>People the have right to wear a mask if they want and businesses do have the right to decline service if they wish, but forcing someone to do anything without choice or say in the matter does typically fall under abuse of power.</p>

        <p>I don’t think anyone’s saying businesses shouldn’t have the option to require masks, but that’s all it should be. An option. A choice.</p>
<p>Mandated/Mandatory masks on people just wanting to walk in public or go to another place that might not require it is inexcusable. The operative word here is CHOICE. No one should have the right to tell you that you MUST wear a mask or be thrown in jail/pay a fine. That is overstepping.</p>

        <p>My city requires us to wear masks in public even when one is walking a dog alone, on a sidewalk, away from everyone. Anyone who thinks this is a sensible science-based rule ought to hit the textbooks and develop some logical reasoning skills.</p>
