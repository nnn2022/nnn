    <strong>How we got into this mess: the history of Covid hysteria in America.</strong>
    <p><p>It really seems as if Covid-19 was the Democrats using the nuclear option to make sure that Trump was not re-elected.  The virus is real and it is sad that a lot of people have had their lives reduced (I read yesterday it was a 3 year decline in life expectancy in 2020).  However, the damage being done to everyone else is wildly out of proportion to the years of life that we are saving.</p>
<p>I was crunching some numbers yesterday and there was a big spike in the overall numbers of deaths in the US for 2020 but that total doesn't even reflect the official death total given by the CDC (\~330k).  More information comes to light and more people have the time to actually dig into the data by doing things such as analyzing the supposed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6937a6.htm">eradication of the flu</a>.</p>
<p>From the very beginning back in February or whenever it was when Trump was on record denying the seriousness of it saying <a href="https://youtu.be/s1B1bOFHWjU?t=11">it was going to go away in April etc.</a></p>
<p>After he said that and then it became clear that wouldn't be the case, the Democrats and the media pretty much went all-in on making 'Trump lied, people died' the strategy.  Now that there has been a massive effort to support the argument via the massive testing infrastructure, it is hard to stop.</p>
<p><strong>None of this makes sense in terms of how things were before.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody regularly got tested for things they had no symptoms for (believe me, I've been denied)</li>
<li>People's personal health are just that, "personal" and since we cannot control how they treat their own body, the best we all can do is not go out of our way to hurt anyone else and we have very clear laws that have been settled on these things for thousands of years!</li>
<li>The government didn't have any authority to shut down businesses that were completely legal the day before without passing some type of law to make that it illegal (as opposed to declaring authoritarian mandates like it happens now).</li>
<li>The bill of rights actually meant something (freedom to practice religion and peaceably assemble etc.</li>
<li>Curfews were limited to children living with their parents and people in active warzones</li>
</ul>
<p>I bet if back in in 2019 you told all of the current lockdown supporters that these things would be a reality in 2021 but not mention who won the election they would  assume it was done by Trump and say "OMG, how could Trump do such things!  That is so unconstitutional, this dictator ignores the Constitution!"</p>
<p>Certainly people will point to coronavirus being a problem in places other than other countries and it's true but I would speculate that to a certain extent, a lot of the world follows American politics and in also is strongly opposed to Trump.  You don't see nearly the type of case counts and deaths in other countries however, most places can't afford spending money on a massive testing infrastructure.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that this was some nefarious plot that was hatched in a smoky back room but our actions are often subconsciously guided by motivations that we aren't even aware of or even deny is having an influence.  It was obviously the strategy by the DNC to go this way but it seems like everyone kind of went along because it became our reality and there is social shame for anyone who dares question any part of these radical changes to society.  I can understand this sentiment because at the beginning of this before my life was disrupted, I felt similarly.</p>
<p>Now the question is how do we get out of this?</p></p>

        <p>&rt; <em>I read yesterday it was a 3 year decline in life expectancy in 2020</em> </p>
<p>The lies are so obvious I don't know how anyone believes them anymore. Life expectancy was down in the last couple of years due to the <em>opioid crisis.</em> If life expectancy is down again this year, it is due to suicides, overdoses, alcoholism, and delays in medical testing and treatments - <em>and the still-ongoing opioid crisis. Which strangely no one gives a shit about anymore.</em></p>
<p>If the age of death from Rona is at or above the normal life expectancy, how the hell can it make it go down?</p>
<p>And think on this: Where did the virus come from? Where is the fentanyl coming from?</p>
<p><em>China.</em></p>

        <p>Interesting.  Also, it's so strange how nobody seems to bring up the fact that this originated from a place in China where they were experimenting on these types of viruses.</p>

        <p>This gigantic issue we are facing has much more to do with history than politics. We would need a world-wide revolution, and the knowledge and intellect to implement good leaders. Won't happen.</p>

        <p>I disagree. </p>
<p>This is less about history. This is all about politics and power. Better leaders come from those that study history. A world wide revolution? Sounds like you're embracing the Socialists dreams.</p>

        <p>Hah. I wonder why he deleted it.  At least he didn't call it a "violent" revolution.</p>
