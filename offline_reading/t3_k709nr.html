<title>if the threat of COVID is really that serious, why are doomers going out without a gas mask and a hazmat suit?

        <p>So this is always a good point against the doomers. If the virus was the second-coming of the Black Plague like the media and social media love to so loudly proclaim, then society is doing a pretty shitty job of reacting to it. Most Mask Nazis don't properly wear their masks, wear an insufficient quality of mask, and/or treat their masks poorly and render them useless. Really, the only way that we can avoid this virus spreading like the wildfire it has, is to all 100% properly wear quality masks at all times and/or to stay locked down at all times for the foreseeable future. Not by mandating that everyone wear some kind of covering over their face, but only in certain locations for certain amounts of time with x,y,z exemptions.</p>
<p>This is why even a national mask mandate would do little to nothing to help the spread of this virus. The best thing we can do is to protect the very old and very vulnerable, while everyone else goes about living their lives as normal as they choose to.</p>

        <p>This is why universal mask mandates could never work in the real world. Your average person simply doesn’t understand basic infection control procedures. It’s a lot more than just putting on a mask, it also includes constant handwashing, proper disposal of masks, and limitation of close contact (we always use disposable gloves and surgical gowns in the hospital). Trying to get 330 million people to do this simultaneously and for more than a year is an impossible task. </p>
<p>Like laughably dumb. Yet this is what Fauci and the governors are asking us to do. </p>
<p>This doesn’t even take into account the bonafide fact that surgical masks do not offer 100% protection from viral transmission (far from it). In a well-controlled laboratory environment you can show that masks may reduce the risk of transmission. But the risk is never 0. Not even close. </p>
<p>Thus covid will continue to spread indefinitely, no matter what all the idiots holding signs on Instagram say.</p>

        <p>&rt;Nowhere near 100% protection. In fact the doctor who I talked with said even IF CoVid-19 was 50% lethal, he wouldn't wear a mask with a disease like that... he would insist on a full body hazmat suit that is self-contained.</p>

        <p>Id also like to point out, why are these politicians from all countries not retreated underground? Why are these press conferences allowed to continue? What are they going out to restaurants etc.. after they just pushed mandates for the rest of their citizens?  Masks or no masks, if this is such a crisis why are they not as far removed as possible?</p>

        <p>no, let me fix that for you. <em>If I actually believed a person was in serious risk of causing a high-speed collision when he drove his car,</em> and I believed this risk was so serious that the speed limit should be universally lowered to 2mph for every person, then of course, I myself would <em>stay off the road altogether.</em> And if I absolutely had to drive for some reason, then of course, <em>I would drive at 2mph,</em> to minimize this very serious risk.</p>
<p>on the other hand, let's say I'm shouting from the rooftops, screaming that driving a car represents an extremely serious risk of a high-speed collision. This risk is so bad, and so extremely serious, I shout, that every single person should be obligated to drive at 2mph. <em>Driving at 2mph is the only way to protect your neighbor from being killed in a car crash! If you see someone driving above 2mph, he is very dangerous, and you will be struck by his car!</em> All these, and other similar things, I scream night and day from the rooftops. Then I go out in my car and I use the road normally, and the only thing I do to protect myself is <em>I put a fucking cloth mask on the hood of my car.</em> And I hope your car has one.</p>
<p>what does this say? Is the threat very real, or not?</p>

        <p>I like the analogy so far, but I'm afraid this is where the analogy starts to break down. I see your points, of course. However, in the real world, I don't think your points are equivalent to a mask mandate, or a lockdown order, or anything that actually exists. Rather, I think your points would better parallel something like: if you just stepped out of the Wuhan lab or whatever, where you personally were working with the live virus, then you're legally required to decontaminate yourself. To me, that makes sense. But if we instead legally require that every other person also decontaminate himself, just because there is some conceivable possibility that the virus has been transmitted even in lieu of any evidence, this, I think, is totally insane. This would be more akin to, say, forbidding <em>every single person from driving a car,</em> simply because there is the possibility the person has consumed the alcohol.</p>

        <p>So since you have never personally killed yourself or (I assume) another person whilst driving, you don't feel limits should be imposed on you personally as to the speed you drive or the amount of alcohol you consume before doing so? If so, how do you indicate to other drivers that you, personally, have not thus far killed another driver or pedestrian? Furthermore, how do you guarantee that - despite the fact that you feel a special right to engage in more reckless behaviour whilst others are doing their part to protect each other - you will not kill anybody in future?</p>
<p>Because in this analogy, you are the person that is insisting on using public roads without knowing your blood-alcohol content, and whilst refusing to observe some simple rules.</p>
<p>Clearly you - an intelligent, reasonable human being - see the merit in a civilised society having a set of rules to protect yourself and those around you. Most of them you have grown up with, but this year we saw some new ones bcause of a crisis. Nobody needs to go to extremes - nobody needs to don a hazmat suit and, conversely, nobody should be running around "owning" retailers becuase they think they know better than professionals that study epidemiology for a living - but this won't be forever. Spanish flu was managed. Smallpox was eradicated by the 1980s. These things, too, will pass. And when you look back in years to come, do you want to recall that you were a contrary smartarse that thought they knew better than everyone else or do you want to think "hey, I did my part. Who knows, I may've even helped save a human life?" Because I know which I'd rather be.</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense. Thamk you for "listening" to my side of things. Do enjoy the rest of your day.</p>

        <p>I like your argument, truly, but I think you're missing the real punchline. That punchline being: all of us, in real life, really do insist on using public roads without knowing our BAC. Of course, we know we didn't <em>do anything conspicuous,</em> anything that would put us at <em>risk</em> of having a high BAC, like for example, willfully getting plastered. But what's to say we weren't slipped some concoction without our knowledge? Maybe we're asymptomatic carriers right now? Carriers of a dreadfully high BAC? I'm assuming you see how ridiculous this is, because, after all, that's the point.</p>
<p>of course, what do we do about it? What is the proper response? Well, we all know we should avoid driving if we have a high BAC, right. Any responsible person would do that, and every person should be expected to do that. But what happens when someone completely overlooks the risk that they may have been slipped some concoction? What happens if a person just assumes he's safe and gets behind the wheel? Do we hold this person responsible? Do we consider this person guilty? Do you?</p>

        <p>More correctly, this is where we have to admit to ourselves that my metaphor was not a direct analogy. One can directly control one's alcohol consumption; beverages are neither invisible nor contagious. Unless somebody slips something in our drink - highly unlikely in general, and probably relatively easy to notice the affects of. However, Covid-19 is incredibly contagious and can be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>(But yes, if you're caught driving with a BAC level above the legal limit, no anount of "but I didn't know, officer" would allow you to escape prosecution.)</p>
<p>So you can control what you need to in order to protect yourself and others: don't drink; don't speed; wear a seatbelt.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you leave the house during a global pandemic, wear a mask. It's not difficult, it's not extreme, it's just a reasonable level of precautiom to protect yourself and other human beings.</p>

        <p>I agree that the mask in itself wouldn't be so bad a thing, if it were truly only a mask. My personal issue is more that, when I reinforce to others that this behavior is sensible in any way, when I contribute to the normalization and the peer pressure by which others are overcome and compelled toward senselessness, which I intrinsically do by wearing the mask, it runs so far counter to my moral integrity that I consider transmitting COVID to others, even intentionally, to be a far lesser evil.</p>
<p>don't kid yourself. You don't know the risk that any person around you at any time could transmit COVID to you, and you also don't know the risk that any person around you could drug you, rendering you a liability and a danger should you choose then to drive your car.  Maybe you will have an aneurysm today while you drive, and your car will careen into a highly trafficked area at 60mph. Maybe someone has mixed fentanyl into a lipid solution that permits rapid absorption through the skin, and you've just been turned into a suicide bomber against your will because you touched your hand against the wrong doorknob. You don't know! The risk exists, just like the risk exists that you could unknowingly carry COVID. Neither one would be your fault, and neither one would preemptively demonstrate itself to be happening. The only difference is you've rightly dismissed one possibility, considering it an unreasonable concern, considering it unreasonable to mitigate -- but for some reason you favor the other, even though it's the same. I disagree: I think your analogy is completely accurate. That's exactly why the punchline <em>is</em> the punchline.</p>

        <p>because the virus is carried on moisture breathed from your mouth and nose. Wearing a cloth mask doesnt catch all the particles, but it stops a lot of them. Which is also why the 6 feet is important. Not everyone can afford a gas mask or whatever you are describing, this is the most cost effective solution.</p>
<p>This virus has killed over 280,000 people, it is possible to stop it, and as much as it pain you to hear it, your life is only worth as much as everyone else's.</p>

        <p>No, it doesn't. This is an AIRBORNE virus and when the stuff dries out... you are sucking in LOTS MORE COVID than you would WITHOUT a mask.</p>

        <p>what does airborne mean to you exactly? </p>
<p>did you know that the virus actually exists inside the fluids in our bodies? they dont just float around in our lungs. Because our lungs are not just empty ballons, but spongy tissue, we literally filter the oxygen out of the air, and we cant do that if the air doesnt come in contact with the lungs.</p>
<p>every ounce of air that you breath out has been in contact with the inside of your lungs, your breath has moisture in it innately because of it. The virus might be able to float by itself, but the only things emitting the virus is our own bodies, thus it is always attached to moisture from our breath. </p>
<p>did you also know that micro droplets of moisture can hang in the air for 10 minutes?</p>

        <p>the thing is, I have absolutely no interest in stopping the virus, in fact I consider this to be a completely preposterous line of thought. Why would the virus need to be stopped? Is that really why you're losing sleep at night? Not because you yourself are at personal risk of infection, but because the virus needs to be totally eradicated from the earth?</p>
<p>I'm just trying to understand. Is there some sensible reason why a normal person should participate in your weird fantasy and help eradicate the virus from the earth, when you could just protect your own self from exposure instead, since you're the one who cares about it? Is this <em>Starship Troopers?</em> Should we annihilate all bugs? Let's say you were biting your fingernails right now, do you think every other person should be legally required to help you bite them until you're finished? I seriously just don't understand. Why the fuck would I care if COVID keeps spreading on the earth?</p>
