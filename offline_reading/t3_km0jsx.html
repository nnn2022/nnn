        <p>The sad thing is that I wouldn't be shocked if this turns out to be legit. We started out by telling people not to touch their faces, which is sensible. After that we somehow arrived at the idea that everyone needs to walk around with their mouth and nose covered, without having evidence this actually helps.</p>
<p>I'm a healthy young man, but very lazy. I'm forced to wear a mask when I go to the supermarket and have a single disposable mask that I store in my coat and have had for months now. What happens when I wear it? In the days afterwards, I find myself coughing. I'm probably introducing bacteria in my lungs.</p>
<p>The Dutch government's official advice is that you need to regularly clean your mask or buy new ones and store it separately from everything else. But everyone knows that when you force people to do something they don't want to do, they're going to be doing it poorly.</p>
<p>What we've typically seen in old people who die of corona viruses (elderly people have been dying of corona viruses for generations) is that they die of viral infections with bacterial infections superimposed over those. It's perfectly possible that masks introduce bacterial infections in people's lungs. That could be one way to explain an observed correlation.</p>
<p>Similarly, we know we're inhaling some of the carbon dioxide we exhale while wearing a mask. After a while it gets uncomfortable, because your brain detects this. We've studied the effects excessive carbon dioxide has for years. We know it can worsen influenza infections, we know it decreases cognitive performance and we know it causes anxiety.</p>
<p>I'm really not a "science-denier", or a "conspiracy theorist" who thinks Bill Gates is trying to sterilize us all. Rather, I'm simply a scientifically literate person who critically looks at evidence. If you're able to distinguish between good science and bad science, as people like  Ioannidis have built a career out of doing, then mask mandates should leave you concerned. We're now living in the exact type of atmosphere of collective societal hysteria where history shows us that dangerous errors are typically being made. Critical thinking goes out of the window when people are panicking.</p>
<p>We've never properly studied the effects of making people walk around covering their faces on a daily basis. Dorks on the Reddit frontpage might like to knock down strawmans by posting N = 1 videos where fit healthy young men go out jogging with a mask on, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a medical experiment at a global scale that's being forced on people who never consented to any of this, with effects that are impossible to anticipate, because <em>it was forced on people without ever being properly studied</em>.</p>
