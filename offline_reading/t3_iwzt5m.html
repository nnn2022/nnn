    <strong>The majority of Reddit posters have zero dignity</strong>
    <p><p>Seeing this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusCirclejerk/comments/iwppla/rcalifornia_starting_to_crack/</p>
<p>That comment shown in the post, suddenly has 258 upvotes and even 1 reddit gold given to it, when months earlier, if someone said that, they would be downvoted to hell or be called a bunch of names such as selfish, covid-denier, etc. And now suddenly they're acting holier than thou and saying "HUH what did people expect, no shit this would be a bad idea.</p>
<p>The one post above was only one example. I've seen plenty of other comments (but I don't have time to link them cause I'm in school right now, yes, face to face/in person in Texas, but there's a tropical storm threat so its cancelled today, giving me the time to make this post, but I still have a google meet in a few minutes) but they are suddenly acting like they've "always" known this was a bad idea, or they throw the previous trend under the bus while adhering to the new belief and pretending as if they've always been on that side.</p>
<p>Uh uh, fuck no, you ain't getting away with it this time. They had absolutely zero problems defending the new normal and the doomers  to hell, and now that the lockdowns have shown how much damage its actually causing, they're trying to shift it and tell us that they've "always" been on our side, or whatever. Did they actually think we'd forget?</p>
<p>Utterly pathetic.</p></p>

<p>This should be obvious from the fact that every time a news story breaks about somebody dying of COVID, they upvote it to the front page, celebrate in the comments, and give hundreds of awards to the post.  Disgusting behavior.</p>

<p>That same person: WELL DUH WHO THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA AT ALL? THINK OF THE WORKING CLASS-</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I fucking can't lmao, but then again, thats the majority of people in not only Reddit, but other social media as well, they have no loyalty and only adhere to the popular trend like sheep, and then abandon it like nothing when there's a new belief or whatever.</p>

        <p>I understand the frustration...</p>
<p>Though there's regulars on LDS (and on here to a lesser extent) who claim that they bought into the lockdown narrative, and were doomers for months until they saw the light. Some of them are even commenting in that post you linked to, acting as if they always agreed with us (won't name names...). </p>
<p>This was always going to happen though, people who were once terrified of the virus and even going as far as acting the same way the trolls did/do, would "turn" and act like they were always against the lockdowns/New Normal. People are hypocrites like that...</p>
