    <strong>I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir but let's talk about prepping.</strong>
    <p><p>I have worked in the same grocery store in a rural mountain town for 12 years now. I manage The Butcher Shop, I have seen distribution disruption in regards to food, but never like I'm seeing now.</p>
<p>The manufacturers, Distributors and truck drivers all have different reasons for these delivery "disruptions" and I wouldn't say that any of them are lying, I just think it's far more severe than anybody wants to talk about.</p>
<p>If you aren't prepping or taking food and water preservation very seriously and are the matriarch or patriarch of your family then I strongly encourage you to start thinking long-term.</p>
<p>When water and food is obviously necessary, you also have to consider any medical conditions for yourself and other people in the family. Whether that be things like insulin or even female hygiene products.</p>
<p>Essential vitamins and nutrients that you cannot live without like vitamin C for example. Without vitamin C you can very easily develop what is called <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/scurvy">Scurvy </a> but the good news is Vitamin C supplements are incredibly cheap and come in large doses like 500 to 1,000 mg a tablet. A full grown adult only needs 90 mg of vitamin C a Day. So a family of four can easily split one tablet a day and remain  healthy. </p>
<p>Having stocked up water is important, but equally as important is a renewable source of water like a reservoir or a running River. So there needs to be some reliable method of filtering and purifying that water. As well as transporting it from The Source back to your home.</p>
<p>If you have plans or have thought that you would procure your own meat via Wild game then take special consideration to what is known as<a href="https://www.thehealthboard.com/what-is-rabbit-starvation.htm">Rabbit starvation or Protien Poisoning </a> we have to have some form of fat.</p>
<p>I am not an expert prepper and don't consider myself to be one. I'm sure there are some members here with more or even better information than what I've listed here. But what I have listed I think to be some of the most important points to start considering. And I would like for more experienced members of this sub to offer and their own insight as well.</p></p>

<p>A personal favorite of mine... if you have this, all these worries disappear. Being self-sufficient in production is far better than hoarding supplies.</p>

        <p>Just google homesteading, there are tons of guides. It's just a micro-version of a self-sufficient homestead. This is more of a "hobbiest" situation. Realistically, this could feed a family of 4 or so indefinitely, HOWEVER, if anything goes wrong (plant blight, dead/sick animals, etc.), the chance of something going wrong is high. You would need much more land, contingency plants, more animals, and so on to safely be able to provide for a family. Even just having a pond nearby with fish helps a lot. 70% of the food from these homesteads are generally animal products because they consistently produce eggs, milk (by extension cheese/butter), etc. For vegetables/fruits, canning would need to be done to maintain freshness and longevity for winter food. Likewise, slaughtering a duck/pig/chicken/cow/lamb here and there provides all the meat you could ever desire.</p>

        <p>I suspect it is from one of John Seymour's self-sufficiency books, but I could be wrong. </p>
<p>The book Self-Sufficiency for the 21st Century has similar layouts comparing urban, suburban, and rural possibilities.  I have been building up my homesteading library, and that book along with The Encyclopedia of Country Living and The Integral Urban House are among the all-around books I have found.</p>
