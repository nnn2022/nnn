    <strong>The movie Snowden kinda changed my perspective on AntiMaskers</strong>
    <p><p>I used to despise you guys and hated this sub for existing. After watching Snowden then posting in here and having some good respectful conversations with people who disagreed, I want you guys to know I may be on the other side and believe masks work, but I also respect that you guys shouldn’t have to wear a mask if that’s your decision. It’s such a shitty situation in general and I hate we all turn on each other. I mean no disrespect for this, but to people who are against abortion and say they won’t wear a mask because it should be their choice, shouldn’t it be the same for women? Again, that’s a serious question and I’m here to learn not cause drama.</p></p>

        <p>Once you allow the state to make medical decisions for you, then you have agreed that you do not own your own body.</p>
<p>It really doesn't get any simpler than that.</p>
<p>I personally am against abortion as a method of convenient birth control, but I don't see how it really compares to masks. Florida is the only state that collects stats on the reason for an abortion, and the rape/incest/medical emergency reasons make up a very small <a href="https://ahca.myflorida.com/MCHQ/Central_Services/Training_Support/docs/TrimesterByReason_2018.pdf">percentage</a>. Which means that the women chose to get pregnant through their actions, and decided it was an inconvenience. The fact that a fetus is considered property until they are born is disgusting to me, and highlights that dogs have more rights than a prenatal human being in most jurisdictions.</p>
<p>That small rant was really about addressing the "my body, my choice" aspect. In the majority of abortions, the woman already made her choice when she took actions leading to pregnancy. Once that choice is made, the baby needs to be able to have protection from a callous parent, no different than protecting an 8 year old from abuse.</p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by and being willing to hear others out. </p>
<p>For me abortion and covid mandates are apples and oranges.  When I say it's my body and my choice to not accept a vaccine, for example, it just affects me. You get your vaccine, if you want to. That's your choice. Me doing what I feel is best for my health isn't an instant death sentence to someone else. </p>
<p>For abortion, you are directly making a life and death decision for someone else. You are deciding the fate of another person.  That baby in the womb had a future. It would've had a name, it would've had friends, it would've had struggles, it would've had triumphs, it would've been someone's crush, it would've been someone's heart breaker. It would've had an entire life but the decision of someone else directly ended all of that. Instantly. Done. Gone.</p>
<p>It's hard to think about a 14 year old girl getting pregnant against her will and deciding to have an abortion because of the trauma of her experience. That hurts, it's sad, and I feel terribly for that girl.  But the reality is that's a fringe case. Most abortions are because someone had an irresponsible night of fun. Terminating another human because of your own irresponsibility is evil. I remember seeing a picture of a young women at a women's "reproductive rights" protest holding a poster bragging about having not 1, not 2, or 3, or 4 abortions but having like 7 abortions and how it made her happy. That is evil. No other way to put it. Straight up evil. She found glee in ending a person's life. A mistake is bad enough, doing it 7 times is despicable. Get on the pill.</p>

        <p>I've always been pro choice and that carried over to masks and lockdowns. Better to have an abortion than have a kid you don't want and treat them as such. Adoption still means carrying a baby you don't want for 9-10 months and the drug addicts and alcoholics will just continue doing those things while pregnant. And I haven't met an adopted person who didn't have at least some hang-ups about it. People aren't going around aborting full term babies on purpose. They get it done as early as possible. Most people find the decision agonizing and something they never forget.</p>

        <p>I'm adopted. My mother regularly used drugs/drank/smoked while carrying me. I don't have any hang ups about it. Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>As an aside, 50% of abortions are women who already had one previous. That can be found on page 48 of the <a href="https://tarahealthfoundation.org/report-release-us-reproductive-health-investment-case/">report</a> from the Tara Health Foundation. So I'm not convinced that most people find it agonizing.</p>

        <p>I agree with you on abortion. I actually considered myself a progressive before all the Covid-1984 nonsense. Now that I'm aware of the Great Reset and that progressive rhetoric is almost 100% in alignment with the techno-fascist rhetoric I am distancing myself from that. In regards to masks based on studies I have read and reports from doctors and other medical health professionals I believe they can range anywhere from a small marginal benefit to a significantly harmful intervention. No rigorous studies have been done showing they are safe for long term habitual use and there does not seem to be any interest by authorities in finding that out. I personally believe their primary goal is to be the visual reminder of "we're in a global pandemic!" and as a scapegoating tool. Seeing as the tv and social media experts love to say that if everyone just wore masks the pandemic would be over already, when there is literally 0 evidence supporting that statement.</p>

        <p>My body my choice--though ironically derived from the abortion issue--doesn't really apply to abortion because in the case of that, it's not your body, it's the child's body, you own child's body. The baby may be inside your body, but that doesn't give you a right to murder your own child. If you don't want a child, then don't make one.</p>

        <p>1) you’re totally in here to cause drama. In the same post you realize you’re being an ass about the mask mandates you feel the need to chastise those who are against mask mandates but also against abortion? Addicted to having the last word are we?</p>
<p>2) Wtf made you angry that this sub existed? And why do you need a media source, documentary or not, to tell you to how feel and when to be civil and open minded? You really need to look at yourself and quit being played like a puppet. Learn critical thinking.</p>
<p>3) Abortion rights and the the right to not wear a mask and the right to not be vaccinated all spring from bodily autonomy and to me they are all indeed important. But that’s really tertiary to the fact that you are an immature jerk.</p>

        <p>Thanks for being open-minded!</p>
<p>Yeah .. I have always thought there is a possibility that masks are a bit effective in some situations. </p>
<p>But the "social cost" of full mandates, and the unknowns about how it affects the development of children (for example) outweigh the benefits by far. It is separating society. But honestly I think <em>that</em> was more of the point than virus protection.</p>

        <p>I’m pro choice. Not because I’m some moral or religious believer but the people who have a baby shop vacuum out of their vagina and into a paper shredder are not the people who will raise that child to be a positive part of society. So let them do their horribly invasive and risk potential long term damage while I am simply choosing to follow my decision to keep mine safe from this vax.</p>

        <p>100% agree with your assessment. Which is why I'm a libertarian. The right can't say they want freedom and not give women the freedom to abort. Even if they don't agree with it.</p>

        <p>It took 2 to get pregnant. Common decency would say “I should ask your feelings first since we decided to be together in a way that could result in a child”. There’s some women out there sucking up child support on guys that had one night stands so this goes both ways too. At the end of the day it is her choice but there’s more than just her involved. There’s no easy answer on what to believe. You believe what you want to believe and let everyone else do the same.</p>

        <p>For me: I don’t want the government to have the power to outlaw abortions because I don’t want them to have the power to mandate them.</p>
<p>I see it as two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>I truly believe in bodily autonomy in all contexts: abortion, masks, seatbelts, etc.</p>

        <p>Even though I abhor abortion, the precedent is set: my body my choice. The fact that I dislike how the precedent came to be doesn't mean that the precedent doesn't apply to me. If the rule is my body my choice, that applies to me as well. If it wasn't the current standing rule, if abortion was illegal and "my body my choice" was just a catch phrase used in campaigns and internet arguements then I wouldn't use it since it isn't the current established doctrine.</p>

        <p>The media doesn’t control me for shit? All I’m saying is I respect and understand people who don’t want to wear a mask because they feel it’s taking their rights away. I don’t watch cnn, fox, or any of that shit. From personal experience, I believe masks work. I’m not here to state facts or change your opinion because I know that won’t happen. Snowden isn’t a documentary and it came out long before the whole pandemic.</p>
<p>Also I’m agnostic.</p>
<p>And also, I came here before and actually tried to learn and understand from this sub. I did my own research, fact checked articles I was sent, so how is that being weak minded? My conclusion was I still believe masks works but I respect you guys.</p>

        <p>i empathize with his tone. it’s frustrating how weak minded and mindless the <em>vast</em> majority of people are, people who actually violently shun dissenters and skeptics, and enforce ideas they haven’t even critically examined on the people around them. their fear drives them to such irrational levels of hatred and mindlessness that it’s difficult to bear as a free thinking person.</p>
