    <strong>I don't think I could handle another Lockdown again...</strong>
    <p><p>(I was originally going to post this at a certain retail sub, but since the majority there are pro mask and lockdowns, I would rather post it here instead)</p>
<p>This is a bit of a different perspective on the lockdown issue but I figures you guys would understand and like what I'd have to say. I work as a cart pusher/cashier at a grocery store and this was my experience back in March, and now what I'm going through yet again....</p>
<p>The endless panic buying, being yelled at for having no carts because they're all already being used at once. Being asked "do you have any toilet paper/Lysol?" For the 50th time Loads of garbage left in shopping carts for me to pick up after. Being short staffed, because managers won't give anyore extra hours, and yet, still expected to meet corporate's unrealistic goals during all of this chaos.</p>
<p>I was planning on staying at this current job for another year for cashier experience, but fuck it I can't take it anymore. I hate having this huge expectation that us retail staff should just bear through all of this a second time with a smile on our faces.That we should just accept being yelled at by angry old ladies and beefed up meth heads every day, yet we arent allowed to go visit our relatives and relax with friends on our off days.</p>
<p>The only thing different now than from back in March is that now everyone, including employees must wear masks on all times. I don't like it, hell most of my co workers don't like it, but we still have to enforce the mask policy on every customer that walks in,which I find bullshit. 
We have so much new rules and regulations we have to follow and our reward for all of this is cut hours and more stress.</p>
<p>Worst thing about this is that even if I quit now, what better jobs are out there? The economy is in the shitter and its going to be years before we start seeing any kind of recovery. Realistically my only options now are to just deal with it, be homeless or commit suicide.</p></p>

        <p>Quit. Don't put up with this shit. You will find another means of income! I just lost my job of 5 years where I worked my way up from hourly to salary because of all this, now it's gone. But...You know what? IM NOT GIVING UP!!! They want me to kill myself or die inside and accept this shit, but I won't. I'm going to be that annoying little fucking prick that just refuses to die and I know that pisses the bastards that started this shit off. It also pisses them off that I believe in you and that I know you have plenty of options and that the fire you see in this post is also in you. As some dude said in Independence Day, "Time to kick the tires and light the fires!"</p>

        <p>No one can determine what his outcome will be but him. I'm finding odd jobs in construction, a far cry from the non CDL trucking gig at my previous job. I have a three year old and a wife to support. No one owes me anything but that also means they cannot expect to live rent free in my head walking around with pity picket signs. The over all message I'm conveying is I believe in the OP and I empathise with his current situation but he will not get out of it with wallowing in despair for too long. NOW IS THE TIME TO FIGHT!!! With everything you got! Acknowledge your breaking point! When you get to the point to where you're asking the question, "Why go on?"  acknowledge it's polar opposite "What else do I have left to lose?" and then fight!</p>

        <p>I seriously wish the mods would ban you from commenting on posts like this. You’re the consummate self pitying misery-loves-company wallower, and you come comment on struggling people’s posts and suck all the oxygen out of the room and basically encourage them to give up on life and do go through with suicide just because you can’t quit whining long enough to try to finagle a stop gap or try a new career trajectory. It’s pathetic and embarrassing and most of all it’s harmful to the OPs and everyone reading your stupid tripe. Gag.</p>

        <p>Can you imagine if most business said screw this bs we are staying open and if people don't want to wear a mask then they don't have to. Govt can't fine and arrest everyone. If more people would stand against the lie then the govt would lose.</p>

        <p>Yeah, lets just ignore the OP's mental suffering. He should be grateful he has a job that expects even more out of him with less pay and the fact that the entire staff's morale is non existent. This is the purist example of disconnect I've seen.</p>
