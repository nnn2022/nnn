    <strong>Every year around 10 million people dies of cancer.</strong>
    <p><p>We will probably end this year with 1.5 m covid victims (officially) </p>
<p>(Unofficially I think we could easily divide it half as many cases are not legit. You can only have virus, die in accident and they will count you in. Eg. George Floyd was counted to US covid death tool and we all know what was the real cause of his death). </p>
<p>Let’s say, the number is real, we didn’t do any lockdowns and we didn’t impose any restrictions. </p>
<p>How much more could it be in that case- following the narrative of 1.5m deaths? Given that masks apparently don’t work and social distancing doesn’t work either, since we keep going back to lockdowns; the weakest get the virus regardless and they’d need to literally stay at home and never go out to not catch it. </p>
<p>Do you know someone who never ever had a flu or cold? </p>
<p>Well, I don’t. </p>
<p>So let’s say, we’re living the same way we’ve been living, let’s agree covid is a bit more aggressive than a regular flu who kills 600k people a year. 1.5 m cases with lockdowns and restrictions, I’d bet it could be max 5 M with no restrictions and lockdowns? Of course, if we keep on following the narrative where you can only enter the party and all 400 people end up having the virus. </p>
<p>Even if it was 5 M it’s nowhere near the cancer score. And it’s still a huge stretch and pretty much just being kind to outraged mass media and their fictional scores. </p>
<p>And so many people are losing their jobs and decide to commit suicides because of that! Is it now okay to say governments are way more than dangerous than this “virus”? I’m really roooooooolling my eyes.</p></p>

        <p>I’ve had leukemia (blood cancer) twice and I can assure everyone it’s worse and deadlier than an pneumonia type flu. I was also in the hospital when SARS (basically the same virus) was going around and I didn’t get it. Possibly the worst place to be and my immune system was very weak.</p>
<p>Edit: just for perspective, I was given a 40-50% chance of survival the first time and 20% the second time. Last time I saw, covid-19 had a 99.6 or 99.8% survival rate.</p>

        <p>I’m really sorry to hear that! I really wish you are recovering well and you’ll get a proper treatment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, seems like world forgot about other diseases. I know many cancer patients are missing on their treatments or places cause they are reserved for potential covid people.</p>

        <p>article mentioning research showing the numbers of deaths of despair coming from increased unemployment:</p>
<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/will-deaths-of-despair-outpace-deaths-from-coronavirus/">https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/will-deaths-of-despair-outpace-deaths-from-coronavirus/</a> </p>
<p>also:</p>
<p>&rt; <strong>Every year around 10 million people dies of cancer</strong> </p>
<p>a more accurate description might be:</p>
<p>&rt;every year around 10 million people get murdered through cancer</p>
<p>the fda, governments and other government organisations and corporations have been in war against real cancer cures for decades.</p>
<p>to just name a few:</p>
<p>pure high thc containing cannabis extract not smoked, but taken orally or put on the issue directly.</p>
<p>vitamin b17</p>
<p>essiac</p>
<p>the gerson therapy (this one is mostly supression of information and treatment centers, as  there is no specific ingredient, that the fda or similar monsters could ban)</p>
<p>cancer is murder through governments.</p>
<p>the same goes for deaths of despair from lockdowns being murder through governments.</p>

        <p>So? What exactly does it change? Did you read the whole post, “jackass”? Flu, contagious as you wish has nearly the same death toll and we’ve been living for ages having possibilities of containing such viruses. Moreover, coronaviruses have been around for ages and people did catch them before 2020. 
Ok, cancer is less serious problem as you say. Because it’s not contagious. You’re right. There is no need to think why carcinogenic items are legal and widely accessible. if cigarettes cause cancer which kills 10 M people a year, then it makes a total sense to ban our social relationships and kill economy for the sake of virus that could potentially kill half of that number. I am a jackass? You just belittled cancer only because it’s not contagious. Look at yourself.</p>
