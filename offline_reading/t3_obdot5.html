    <strong>Extreme shoulder pain after second dose.</strong>
    <p><p>So I don‚Äôt usually post about COVID stuff, but since I frequent this sub a lot I feel like I‚Äôll ask my question here, since I‚Äôll likely get a more real answer here than anywhere else in this crazy new world we‚Äôre living in.</p>
<p>So I myself am not vaccinated, simply because I don‚Äôt wanna put my body up for trial, but sadly my grandma who‚Äôs 78 is. She‚Äôs an old lady who‚Äôs impossible to convince of anything and swears by what she sees on the daily news. Regardless I love her to death, she‚Äôs my grandma after all üòî.</p>
<p>About 3 days after her second dose, the area she got the vaccine has been in serious pain, and it‚Äôs been getting worse and worse over 2 weeks, to the point she can‚Äôt even more that side of her body from shoulder to hip‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Finally I was able to convince her to go get checked out at a doctor and she has an appointment in a few days, however, has anyone else heard of any such side effect.</p>
<p>She‚Äôs otherwise healthy with no issues (although who knows seeing as she never goes to the doctors‚Ä¶), but she is 78 after all‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Any thoughts? Any way I can help her prior to her appointment?</p></p>

        <p>Arm pain where the vaccination was given seems like a normal side effect due to immune response. </p>
<p>However it lasting for over 2 weeks is definitely abnormal. Can you update me after the appointment?</p>

        <p>Sounds like it might be nerve damage from the injection itself.</p>

        <p>Dandelion is a liver cleanser and toner. I don‚Äôt think the connection to vaccine injury has been established though.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know if any of these suggestions actually help with vaccine injury‚ÄîDoctors whose work I have looked into suggest that there is no known way to reverse effects once injected‚Äîbut it wouldnt hurt to try anyway. </p>
<p>I know another doctor who recommends nanosilver as she claims that nanosilver ‚Äúdisrupts‚Äù spike protein function, but I don‚Äôt understand how so I take it with a grain of salt. But again, nanosilver destroyed my MRSA infection‚Äîso while not COVID related‚Äîit was still useful.</p>

        <p>Both my husband and I have had side effects from vaccines in the past. Not covid as we never took it but I'm suspecting heavy metal toxicity. He's developed a condition where his hands jump or jerk, and there's been numerous autoimmune and skin conditions over the last 10 years since we began taking yearly flu shots. And his condition got much worse when he had to take a bunch of vaccines for a job that he was doing.
If it wasn't for the covid-19 vaccines and the damage done by them I don't think he and I would have ever put together what had happened to him. So now we're attempting to clear our bodies of anything that shouldn't be there. We're going to try pine needle tea. I have dandelion tea in the house already. Also chlorophyll.</p>

        <p>Man, I am super sorry to hear that. It‚Äôs so hard to recover from something like this, but there is help out there. So I‚Äôm in a similar situation...maybe I can share with you what I‚Äôve learned to be helpful. Ask me anything you want...this is so frustrating and I have been trying to repair damage for a while.  I think my learning disability (SCT) is <em>potentially</em> due to a vaccine injury. Long story, I won‚Äôt get into it here, but here is what I‚Äôm doing that I‚Äôve found helpful. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every day, eat 1 bunch of cilantro on an empty stomach. A large amount of cilantro causes the liver bile ducts to contract and bile is released. 1 hour after eating cilantro, eat rehydrated bentonite clay or another chelator (stay away from spirulina and chlorella bc potential for mercury contamination). The chelator mixes with bile and ‚Äúpicks up‚Äù things like heavy metals present in bile. Do this for 1 week and experience REMARKABLE shift in mental clarity. Do it first thing in morning too on empty stomach. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have an infrared sauna that I bought online for $150 on wayfair. Several mornings per week, I coat myself in bentonite clay and fossilized shell powder (heavy metal chelators) and sit in sauna and sweat. Some heavy metals are present in sweat and reabsorbed if sweat sits on skin too long (therefore chelator on skin to pick up heavy metals is helpful). Important to take shower immediately after to minimize reabsorption.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use Stamets stack and ayahuasca. Read up on Stamets stack. Lions mane (I make my own tincture from WILD lions mane...more potent than store bought) is seriously underrated. Psilocybin and ayahuasca have shown neuro generative effects in hippocampus, the region of the brain responsible for learning and memory. These obviously dont remove heavy metals, but either regrow neurons (psilo and ayahuasca) or protect from further damage (lions mane). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parasites may compound neurological problems and their presence is a lot more common than people realize. I use a variety of things for this (making some absinthe now), but simple clove and wormwood tea consumed 2x daily for 1-2 weeks will cut back on this problem. Repair intestinal lining afterward with 3g l-glutamate every 90 minutes (30 g/day) for 10 days. A lot of people dont see benefit from l-glutamate because the recommended dose is too low...30 g/day is where it‚Äôs at.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope this is helpful. I‚Äôm a slow typer so I hope I didnt write in vain. Good luck to you and your husband in finding something that works.</p>

        <p>Do you mean connect to others with this problem? Not that I know of unfortunately. </p>
<p>I read a lot and though I‚Äôve been dealing with this problem for 15 years, I‚Äôve only found really helpful things within the last 2.  If you want and wouldn‚Äôt find it too weird, save my username and reach out to me if you need guidance on anything. I know the feeling of futility, like there‚Äôs nothing to be done, but there are helpful things out there...Like I said, I‚Äôve been trying to fix this for a LONG time. While not healed from SCT, I‚Äôve made a lot of strides and have learned a lot about what‚Äôs actually helpful, even if it‚Äôs not mainstream approved. Let me know if you have specific questions...this info only really scratches the surface of stuff I use. </p>
<p>PS‚Äîmaybe consider ayahuasca too. my church is found at aya.guide.</p>
