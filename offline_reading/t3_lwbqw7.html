    <strong>All part of the plan</strong>
    <p><p>So, things are starting to get back to normal finally. Cases of the supposed “Rona” are down and hospitals aren’t full. “As if they were anyways” Here in Japan cases are way down, and in the states Texas is 100% open and no mask, Florida also and some other states are following.</p>
<p>BUT... Don’t think for one second these fuckers  will ever give our freedoms back. Not when they gotten away with so much and the masses let them... This is part of their plan, to give you that taste of the old normal and let you feel how good it was. Then all a sudden, BAM! A new mutation called Covid-21 which they’ll claim is much more infectious and deadly. They’ll do this shit all over again but much worse and they’ll push the vaccine even harder.It‘s coming followed by climate lockdowns, only question is when? Could be a year, a few.. who knows? But they will continue this shit.</p>
<p>Here in Japan I think they’ll hit us not long after the Olympics. My theory is they’ll claim the virus mutated and spread from people coming into the country.</p></p>

<p>I've been saying this since they floated the coronavirus vaccines trial balloon back in April: they will blame the severe sickness and death that'll result from the so-called vaccines that'll induce antibody dependent enhancement in those who allow themselves to be injected with this toxic ooze. The severe sickness and deaths will be labelled C21 and even more severe lockdowns will be enforced. </p>
