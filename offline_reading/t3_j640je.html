        <p>While organizations track excess deaths, the only conclusion in the mainstream media is : The coronavirus death toll must be much higher. </p>
<p>Reality Check: The politicians virus response is responsible for these deaths.</p>

<p>&rt; For every 100 deaths directly attributed to COVID-19, there were another  36 excess deaths, meaning the count should be about 36 percent higher,  the team, led by the University of Pennsylvania, found.  </p>

        <p>I literally know of SIX people just in my personal circle who have died <em>during</em> Covid...not ONE of whom died FROM Covid.</p>
<p>I think in some ways this has just been a weird year for a lot of people...i.e. I can only even attribute one of those six deaths to lockdown side effects (delayed treatment), but that’s honestly a stretch because that particular person wouldn’t have sought treatment regardless.  The rest were just random things like heart attack (LAD, the “widow maker” that unless you collapse in the parking lot of an ER you’re pretty much screwed), a cancer patient who just happened to die this year, etc.  Basically, Covid and even lockdown aside, this (at least for me) has been a noticeably higher-than-normal-deaths year so far.</p>

        <p>Musical performance, theatre, and the arts, as well as common interactions like bridge clubs are forbidden. These know-it-all culture cancelers are deliberately ignorant that the arts and humanities have many positive benefits to society. Many deaths that are 'scientifically unattributed' are certainly caused by heartbreak and isolation.</p>
