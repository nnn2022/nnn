    <strong>Right before I was banned from news somebody linked me a website about a cult</strong>
    <p><p>I considered I might be in a cult like this concerned redditor thought I was but I checked it and golly gee I sure learned a lot. I was about to suggest the same to them after reading their link: https://www.daretodoubt.org/cults</p>
<p>&rt; Does your group show unquestioning commitment to its leader, alive or dead? </p>
<p><em>cough GodFauci</em> Oh sorry that must be the covid.</p>
<p>&rt;• Are doubts and questions discouraged or punished?</p>
<p>Hahahahaha</p>
<p>&rt;• Are mind-altering techniques such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, and sleep deprivation or overworking used in excess (which, unwittingly or not, often serve to suppress doubts about the group and its leadership)?</p>
<p>"Trusssst the Ssscciiience" ok this is a stretch I admit</p>
<p>&rt;• Does the leadership dictate how members should think, act, and feel? How they should dress, where they should live, and whom they should marry?</p>
<p>Feel : Afraid</p>
<p>Wear : Masks and hazmat suits but not while eating</p>
<p>Marry : Other clean people through the special tinder category</p>
<p>Act : Like robots</p>
<p>&rt;• Does the group feel they’re on a special mission to save humanity? Do they see their leader as a special being or an avatar? </p>
<p>Nah not at all nothing about saving humanity pops into my head. I mean at one time it might've but that could've been a false memory, symptom of covid.</p>
<p>&rt;• Does the group have an us-versus-them mentality?</p>
<p>I dunno does it?</p>
<p>&rt;• Does the leadership induce feelings of shame or guilt in order to influence or control members? Often this is often done through peer pressure and subtle forms of persuasion.</p>
<p>Or losing your job like this football guy just did you're(they were) all praising. </p>
<p>&rt;• Does the group require members to cut ties with family and friends, or to radically alter the personal goals and activities members had before they joined?</p>
<p>Nah all those news articles telling the vaccinated to cut all ties with the filthy plague rats were fake news just not edited yet.</p>
<p>&rt;• Is the group preoccupied with bringing in new members and/or making money?</p>
<p>Money, check. It's all they care about. All the vaccine companies have extensive criminal history of ignoring safety and patients over the almighty dollar, except they don't really need it/us anymore, they have robots to take over when we're gone. This is the endgame</p>
<p>&rt;• Do you fear backlash to yourself or others if you leave—or even consider leaving—the group?</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>&rt;- Gaslight to make you doubt your own memory </p>
<p>&rt;- Require you to report thoughts, feelings, &amp; activities to superiors</p>
<p>&rt;- Encourage you to spy and report on others’ “misconduct”</p>
<p>....That sure is a lot of flags and I just wanted to help but I was banned before I could reach out to them to try to get them kidnapped and deprogrammed or sent to elan. So I'm posting it here so it didn't go to waste. They don't know it but I think they might be in a cult.</p></p>
