        <p>"When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face," he said at the time."</p>

        <p>Crazy. Sounds like the opposite tune he’s been using. Where was this said?</p>
<p>I agree masks won’t be perfect and in fact I completely agree about the face thing. I won’t wear my glasses with my mask because they get fogged up I have to keep adjusting it and touching my face. </p>
<p>But you said “all experts agree” masks were USELESS. Obviously they are t a catch-all but the previous poster’s point was it might help and isn’t that big of a deal, which I agree with as well. Who is saying masks are USELESS?</p>

        <p>60 Minutes.  I figured this was well known.  The reason Fauci was against masks is because he knows they have negative consequences.  People are constantly touching their face.  People who are sick mistakenly think they are okay to go out in public.  The masks end up doing more harm than good.</p>

        <p>Sorry, no, I hadn’t seen that. I understand his point about not touching your face but you don’t expect me to take it to believe he means masks are USELESS. I wear a shirt every day. Wearing a shirt may increase my risk of being accidentally hanged but I still wear one out of respect for others. Similarly, masks are annoying but they do catch particulates and slow the spread of germs. Even if it’s only a little bit. Trust me, I hate government mandates but i would still wear a mask without it. </p>
<p>But you said “every expert” agrees masks are useless and that sounds like hyperbole. I bet you mean “most experts agree masks won’t stop coronavirus nor are they 100% effective” which I certainly agree with. But can you honestly say an extra piece off cloth on your face will do literally nothing? I don’t want a mask for the rest of my life but as long as there’s a contagious illness that sometimes doesn’t show symptoms and is potentially fatal I might as well just throw one on to be nice, right?</p>

        <p>Why would you leave out that last bit if it wasn’t intentionally to remove context? They go on to obviously say masks are useful because they need them. Remember we’re not saying masks will save the world or end COVID but you need to admit that they do help in a small way and you just don’t care and dont want to wear one. I feel you. I hate them too. But don’t pretend the science supports your stance when you don’t want to do something. Don’t spread lies like “every expert says masks don’t even do anything” when what you mean is “I know a mask MIGHT help but they’re annoying and I don’t care”</p>

        <p>Actually I think I see what you’re trying to say. You think these experts are backpedaling their original stance which you claim is “masks are useless” in order to avoid political backlash. </p>
<p>The inconsistency I think you are referring to looks (to me) like a lot of little things, again, taken out of context. I think you’ll find evidence of experts saying masks aren’t as good as social distancing or that you don’t NEED a mask to be safe. These things are in regards to events like people buying up all the masks and creating a shortage of people still gathering because they think masks are 100% effective. </p>
<p>But can you honestly tell me you think that medical experts wouldn’t recommend covering your mouth if you are sick? Not COVID, just in general?</p>

<p>If I'm sick, I'm staying home, away from the public. I'm certainly not going out in public with a flimsy cloth mask.  </p>
<p>Again, tell me where in the pandemic playbook does universal mask wearing come in to play?  Find me anything from 2019 or earlier. Surely, if masks are so effective, this should be easy to find.</p>

        <p>Sure. It was easy. It took me less than 5 mins. From the CDC in 2018:</p>
<p>“Respirators are tight-fitting masks that can protect the wearer from fine particles (37) and should provide better protection against influenza vi- rus exposures when properly worn because of higher filtration efficiency. However, respirators, such as N95 and P2 masks, work best when they are fit-test- ed, and these masks will be in limited supply during the next pandemic. These specialist devices should be reserved for use in healthcare settings or in special subpopulations such as immunocompromised per- sons in the community, first responders, and those performing other critical community functions, as supplies permit.”</p>
<p>Same paper:</p>
<p>“There are still few uncertainties in the practice of face mask use, such as who should wear the mask and how long it should be used for. In the- ory, transmission should be reduced the most if both infected members and other contacts wear masks, but compliance in uninfected close contacts could be a problem (12,34). Proper use of face masks is essen- tial because improper use might increase the risk for transmission (39). Thus, education on the proper use and disposal of used face masks, including hand hy- giene, is also needed.”</p>

        <p>Now for the fun part: I took this a bit out of context to prove my point, much as the quotes you provided have done:</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/pdfs/19-0994.pdf</p>
<p>In the studies done there was no evidence that face masks slowed the spread of influenza but the CDC admits that common sense dictates it should and the reason was likely that people used them wrong. Much like what Dr Fauci was talking about on 60 minutes. But I left that context out to support my viewpoint. You keep saying none of your three quotes werent taken out of content despite me providing context so I thought I would provide an example for you of what I mean since I don’t think we have a shared understanding of what “out of context” means</p>

        <p>What was it you said to me earlier? “Should I keep going?” Unlike your claims I can’t easily dispute these with 2 seconds of googling and I provided the full context which proves there isn’t some underlying discussion point being omitted. I asked you to provide an example earlier because I couldn’t find any evidence of your claims whereas I was easily able to find and provide evidence of my claims. I already had searched before I asked you and it was all dubious which was why I asked. Did you already do the pre 2020 mask research yourself before asking me to do it for you? </p>
<p>If so you should easily be able to find someone saying “masks are USELESS” from before 2019 and became “political”. Nothing about COVID, nothing saying masks are perfect. Just one expert saying masks don’t do ANYTHING</p>

        <p>I’d also like to add that two of your three examples were from talk shows which each have an agenda of their own, whatever that is. Either to spread the truth or spread their version of it they can edit and cut segments as well as encourage guests beforehand to use certain language or avoid certain topics. Do you think that could be contributing to the inconsistencies you’re seeing? It seems like when you check the medical experts’ opinions on masks from their own platforms it looks like they want people to generally use them. Do you think they are afraid of their voters or constituents and that’s why? Or do you think that some other outlets might be taking their words out of context? Either is possible and I’m not saying I’m right and you’re wrong but let’s think about it</p>

        <p>I’m just saying full context isn’t supplied in a talk show recording. That’s all. You take what they said on a show more seriously than their official statements and I think it’s because you think they are being coerced into saying those things while ignoring the fact that a talk show has a lot of control over how a guest comes off</p>

        <p>Haha, sorry, I was gonna be done but just in case you did take those things out of context I decided to look a couple of them up and of course.... they were taken out of context. </p>
<p>Dr Fauci on 60 minutes and the surgeon general’s tweet are both in reference to mask shortages. Meaning the general public buying them all up was making it hard for hospitals and health providers to get ahold of them. Both Fauci and the CDC recommend covering your face to slow the spread of germs. They were t saying masks are USELESS. They were saying a medical mask is not much more effective than a cloth covering for the general public and that medical grade supplies should be rationed for medical emergencies. It’s not a political statement. It has nothing to do with COVID. Covering your face, while it won’t make you some kind of superhero, will limit the transmission of germs. Full stop.</p>

        <p>Ahh.. I can visualize the gears turning in your head... </p>
<p>So did Fachi say masks don't work because he was lying, necessary to protect healthcare workers?  Or was he wrong because he had a very poor understanding of the virus ? </p>
<p>Or is there perhaps a third option, where he was speaking honestly, but didn't yet understand the political ramifications of his words?</p>

        <p>+1 point to you for being the first to try to insult the other in our discussion. </p>
<p>Again, I ask you to point to where literally any expert has said “masks don’t work”. What do you mean political ramifications of his words? You said he (and you also said EVERY EXPERT) said “masks are useless” when what he said was “there’s no need for everyone at this point in an outbreak to wear a mask. Save them for the people who really need them”</p>
<p>Why is it if I use google, bing, or duckduckgo to search for a single expert who says masks don’t work all I can find are warnings not to take things out of context and quotes from the Mayo Clinic and the CDC saying face coverings are a least a little bit helpful? If it was EVERY EXPERT surely some evidence would be easy to find? Or did the deep state assassinate them all and delete their research?</p>
<p>I’ve changed my mind. Please keep going. And please link videos tweet or articles and not type your own quotes out.</p>

        <p>If you go back to February or early March of 2020, every expert was dismissing masks as a viable strategy. And prior to that, masks were never part of the pandemic playbook. </p>
<p>If masks worked, then how come the CDC - an agency with 10,000+ employees, and a billion dollar annual budget, tasked specifically with dealing with deadly viruses, which had been in existence for 60+ years - didn't immediately advocate for masks?</p>

        <p>No, sorry, not that they were lying. What they said about the masks being unnecessary for the general public which I don’t deny nor do I claim it was a lie. My point is that these experts still want you to cover your face. The CONTEXT of the discussions was that masks were in shortage and the general public doesn’t need a medical grade mask. Especially the SG tweet. If you don’t see how removing the last sentence from that was taking taking it out of context then I don’t think you are discussing in good faith.</p>

<p>This is very true. Dems and Rubs alike were denying the virus.  Pelosi was hugging people in Chinatown, Trump was doing whatever it is he does. </p>
<p>But things changed quickly in late March into April.  That's when everything, masks included, became political.</p>

        <p>I seriously am not trying to attack you personally but I’m starting to honestly believe you don’t know what it means to take something out of context for your own benefit. </p>
<p>Context is super important. If the SG “says stop buying masks. they are useless” it’s a bit different than “stop buying masks. you can just cover your face with a piece of cloth and save the masks for the people who need them” right? At least tell me you can se the difference there???</p>
