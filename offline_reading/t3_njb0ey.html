    <strong>Update: I Almost Died</strong>
    <p><p>Lol jk. </p>
<p>It's been over a year and I've yet to contract the "Novel" coronavirus. I've been up and down the east coast, out to the midwest, in close and distant quarters with others for extended periods of time, visited family, hardly ever wear a mask, so on and so forth. And yet amazingly, despite all of this so-called risky behavior, I've yet to catch Covid. </p>
<p>I did however take supplemental vitamins like I always do, get plenty of nutrients and eat relatively well, exercise, and wash my hands before I put my hands near my face. </p>
<p>And the craziest part of all is that I did this without the vaccine. I didn't need to take 3 days off from work and lay in bed with chills and persistent nausea "For the greater good." </p>
<p>Real novel idea, I know üôÑ</p></p>

        <p>I just engaged in my normal life and I did contract COVID along with my wife and several co workers.  With the exception of one guy, it was easily the lightest bout of sickness I‚Äôve had in decades.   A dull headache for a few days.  My ‚Äúfever‚Äù hit a startling 100.2 for about 20 minutes then never came back.    The worst part of the whole deal was losing my sense of smell for about 3 weeks.     </p>
<p>The one guy that took it harder than the rest of us had a 102 fever for around 3 days.    No one went to the hospital.  No one ever had any breathing difficulties.   No one suffers from ‚Äúlong term COVID‚Äù.  Everyone made full, complete and easy recoveries.    That was last July.   The worst part of COVID for me was losing a month of work due to hysteria...</p>

        <p>But, but muh reproductive capabilities are gone cuz of orange man's refusal to control the virus. </p>
<p>It's funny how they think they can become sterile from Covid, but not from the vaccine. The truth is, we really don't know enough about either to make such bold proclamations</p>
<p>And then they tell stories about how their mailman's sister's cousin three times removed was admitted to the hospital and will never be able to walk again because of Covid. It's like give me a fucking break. Even if that did happen, it's one isolated incident. And even then, there's likely a lot more to the story than they let on.</p>

        <p>I'm unclear on what you're talking about. As far as I'm concerned, quarantines are good for nothing</p>
<p>COVID ravaged your household? How so? You lived to tell the tale, so was it really all that bad?</p>
<p>What does you're wife getting pregnant 7 months after the abovementioned "Ravaging" have to do with anything? How does it prove that quarantines are good?</p>

        <p>It's been over a year that I've been hoping to get the virus.</p>
<p>As a healthy person with a strong immune system that has little to fear from it, I would appreciate the opportunity for time off at 80% pay that is currently offered in my country. I could milk it for all it's worth, because the NPCs are so terrified that no-one would question how long I take to recover after a positive test.</p>
<p>I'm  a mobile worker that travels daily around a major global city. I've been wearing masks only where strictly mandated to do so, and doing my best to breathe deeply any time I get close to strangers. I remain disappointed.</p>

        <p>I've been on immunosuppressants for years. I just upped my vitamin D and Zinc, travelled internationally, never wore a mask, never closed my business, never had a test. I should be dead, but I still don't know a single person in real life who contracted it. You'd think after a year and a half of the deadliest pandemic I would have buried at least some older friends or relatives by now, but not a single person. I have clients, colleagues and family in about 15 different countries. Never heard any of them losing a loved one either. It's a lie of unfathomable proportions.</p>
