        <p>Did anyone react to this so far?</p>
<p>These reddit bots think there is a consensus of experts and scientists when it comes to everything in this pandemic, when in fact that cannot be further from the truth. The censorship became so obvious, you don't need more than one working brain cell to realise it and I haven't seen any public debates when it comes to anything, let alone something crucial like the new injectables. Instead, as we all know, any pathologist, virologist or any other expert is immediately discredited if he dares to say anything other than "wear a mask" or "stay at home".</p>
<p>Let me tell you something, an average person cannot be that stupid. These are textbook examples of brain-washed individuals.</p>
<p>Under a video on Youtube, with Dr. Ezike talking openly about covid death count inflating, a comment says it's wrong of her to come out with that information because now people might relax a bit thinking the virus isn't deadly enough. The same commenter, of course, reminds us once more to wear our masks and not listen to this doctor because what she is saying is irrelevant. This was about 8 months ago.</p>
<p>It is irrelevant because the individual is programmed to automatically dismiss any counter-narrative, even if it comes from someone who is allowed in the media and who in general supports the mainstream agenda. So why would you expect them to listen to us or the banned experts? Those people are already lost. Luckily, they are a minority. What's concerning is that unfortunately, majority are conformists and that is hard to fight because those are the people who know the truth but care about themselves more than others. Good news is, they can change and are changing, unlike the first category.</p>

        <p>I've read something and it is moronic. They are calling him anti-vax, which he obviously isn't. I'd like to see Dr. Bossche and this one Dr. Musa Mohd who dared to state Dr. Bossche is wrong and gave a polio and small pox vaccinations as an example in a debate on CNN for example. LOL. That might work with the same group of brain-washed people from my first comment.</p>
<p>I would also like to see Dr. Musa's credentials.</p>
<p>I really have a hard time accepting the reality in which we live, where the greatest actual experts get "discredited" by some 3rd class GPs and/or politicians. I personally know a doctor specialized in pediatric oncology. He is one of the top doctors in that field in my country. Has a basic clue about virology though and isn't very life-smart to be honest.</p>
