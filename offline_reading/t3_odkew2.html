    <strong>I feel bad for some people...kinda</strong>
    <p><p>Being in Maryland, Hogan Lift the mask requirements on the 1st and its quite exciting for me because i dont have to wear that fucking mask on my deliveries anymore. The problem is i think some people didnt get the Memo....I tried taking a Lyft and they are still  requiring masks. I told the driver that because the mask mandate got lifted i no longer have to wear a mask, even in transportation. The Driver just said its still lyfts policy, which is such bullshit. The other thing is, going to walmart and giant for stuff for the 4th, people are still using the masks!! -.- Maybe people just arent as informed as i am, but thats pretty sad for them that they are  still being good sheep.</p></p>

        <p>Cult of The Mask majority areas don't care about rights or mandates. Mandates only allowed them to have 12 free months of unquestioned authority and access to the guns of State on speed-dial in order to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Now that mandates are lifted, they continue on through fear and suspicion, and business owners fall back on "Refuse service for any reason, get out or Trespass" tactics to continue it all.</p>
<p>Government has no real power, compared to Edna's Farm Market, who unlike the Government, can deny free and perfectly healthy Citizens from accessing food, medicine and essential services unless they comply to Edna herself.</p>
<p>Edna now apparently has medical authority, not only over her customers but over her employees - she can require them to wear Mask and get Vaccinated as a condition of employment.</p>
<p>Who's the enemy again? You think it's the government? The UN? The New World Order? HA!</p>
<p>Edna is affecting more change in your society than any of the rest of them could.</p>

        <p>Around here the mandate was lifted a few weeks ago but most people stopped wearing masks well before then.  Enough people get tired of the nonsense and that happens.  When the stale state order was removed it was noted by few with little fanfare.</p>

        <p>In areas where Cult of the Mask holds majority, there is no choice for consumers, as all businesses have colluded together to maintain Masks against their own Health Officer who dropped the mandates.</p>
<p>They 'follow the science' then ignore it to suit their own needs at the time, and to serve their own fears and suspicion.</p>
