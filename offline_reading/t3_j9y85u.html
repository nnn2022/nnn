        <p>Note that the study overestimates the CFR for COVID-19 because it only includes data for up until 26 April 2020 (see the full text). It therefore doesn't capture the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/06/why-is-it-that-while-covid-19-cases-are-rising-deaths-continue-to-fall">rapid decline</a> since February-April 2020 due to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/25/two-thirds-patients-die-coronavirus-would-have-died-year-anyway/">harvesting effect</a>, as well as ongoing <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anae.15230">progress</a> in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20477724.2020.1785782">treatment</a>. </p>
<p>Quote from the first link:
&rt;Do hospitals have better treatments?
Researchers at Oxford have published analysis showing that people with the virus in June were <strong>four times</strong> less likely to die in hospital than in April. There are several factors playing a part: doctors switched from ventilators, which pump oxygen directly into the lungs with a tube, to using non-invasive devices such as CPAP. Infection control improved as hospitals created Covid-19 wards, and hospitals are quieter, reducing pressure on clinicians. The steroids dexamethasone and hydrocortisone both also improve chances of recovery by calming the body’s immune response.</p>
<p>Probably the paper got blocked in the peer-review process, had to change several journals, and this would easily explain why an October (publication-date) paper only has data from up until 26 April. This also means that if the same analysis were to be done with full 2020 data, by now COVID-19 CFR would be lower than that of both types of influenza.</p>
