    <strong>First post here, happy to have found the sub</strong>
    <p><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>First of all, I’m delighted to find the sub. As with probably many people here, the phrase “new normal” creeped me out when I first heard it and creeps me out now, I’ve despised mask-wearing since it first became a thing, I’m horrified by the shaming and guilting associated first with not wearing a mask and increasing with not being vaccinated, and I’m worried about the vaccine(s).</p>
<p>I should note that, also like many people here (judging from the comments I’ve read), I’m not anti-vaccine. Nevertheless, I am worried about how quickly these vaccines were approved, how they’re only emergency-use, and how many side effects have been reported. I’m the right age and sex for the myocarditis susceptibility that’s affecting mostly 20-something-year-old men right now.</p>
<p>My family is divided on vaccines right now. My father, my maternal grandmother, my uncle, and my cousin have gotten vaccinated (all Pfizer, I believe). My other uncle (who’s now firmly anti-vaccine), my mother, and I have not.</p>
<p>I keep saying I’m on the fence about it—and really I am. If I got any of the vaccines, by the way, it would probably be J&amp;J. The single shot is appealing, as is the lack of myocarditis so far.</p>
<p>What prompted me to post here is hearing from my best friend, who is in medical school in another country and has been stuck there this entire time. He goes on vacation with my family and me every year (except, for obvious reasons, for last year), but this year he said that even if he were able to get back soon, as he hopes, he won’t be able to come if he is not, or we are not, fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>My one uncle is definitely not getting vaccinated. My mom and I are scared but still on the fence. So far my friend has not said he won’t be with us if we’re not vaccinated—he just has to be (and he hopes he will be in time for the vacation). But I’m just extremely worried he’s going to break up our long friendship over my not being vaccinated. His family is gung-ho on vaccines and can’t understand why anyone wouldn’t get one.</p>
<p>Has anyone else been in this predicament? Does anyone know what to say? I’ve always felt able to tell my friend anything; he’s been a pal through thick and thin. But this pandemic has made even him look at me funny and say stuff like “the benefits outweigh the risks.”</p>
<p>Sometimes I think I’m going to lose my mind over the whole goddam thing. I keep getting pulled in different directions by different people. The one good thing is that (I think) my job isn’t requiring the shot, so I don’t think that’s at risk. But I’m so scared of losing family and friends over this.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me rant! ;) If this isn’t a good fit for the sub or fits better in the weekly thread, let me know.</p></p>

        <p>If you explain the reasons why you don’t want the vaccine to him; (which are very objectively reasonable reasons), and he can’t handle it; then that’s a him problem, not a you problem.  </p>
<p>Just calmly explain why; no need to hide things or keep it secret.  If he’s a good friend he’ll listen to you and should at least respect or “agree to disagree”.  If he’s vaccinated he has no reason to worry about your vaccination status; he’s protected. Also you probably already have been exposed to covid and have natural immunity by this point</p>

        <p>I’m probably overthinking this… He said he’d get the vaccine and recommended that I get it, not that he’d break off the friendship because I’m (probably) not getting it. I just keep hearing horror stories about families, friends, romantic partners, etc., splitting because of vaccine disagreements and got worried about it.</p>

        <p>I don’t have any advice for you but I just wanted to say I totally understand what you are feeling! It’s like my life is split. My whole family is very very anti covid vax and I completely understand their viewpoint and I also do not want to be vaccinated because I’m healthy and in my 20s. My boyfriend and I are still on the fence though because alllll our friends are vaccinated and we are constantly concerned it’s going to cause issues and unsure the best way to address it when they ask us when we are getting vaccinated. My boyfriend also has to go back to office soon and his coworkers are guilting him about it. I also feel like I’m going to a little crazy over it all trying to figure out what the right thing to do is. Just hang in there and take it day by day! That’s all I know to do 😂</p>

        <p>Just try having a civil talk with him and ask him what benefits and risks he is talking about. Gather some info from the lead scientists with statistical data and if he still insists on taking the vaccine, there is nothing else you can really do and most probably it’s time for you two to part ways.</p>
