    <strong>Victoria's ridiculous model predictions used to justify one of the world's stictest lockdowns</strong>
    <p><p>(This is a cross-post from /r/LockdownSkepticism.)</p>
<p>Victoria recently had a second <a href="https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/paec/article/4554">inquiry into the Victorian Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. As far as I can tell, this hearing was not publicised and the figures reported by the various ministers and health officers were not reported in the media.</p>
<p>However, the models used to justify the draconian measures imposed on Victorians ought to be scrutinised. You can find these models' predictions on <a href="https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/images/stories/committees/paec/COVID-19_Inquiry/Presentations_Round_2/200810_Premier_PAEC_COVID19.pdf">p. 4 of Dan Andrew's presentation</a> or on <a href="https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/images/stories/committees/paec/COVID-19_Inquiry/Presentations_Round_2/PAEC_August_11_Minister_Mikakos_Presentation_Final.pdf">p. 3 of Jenny Mikakos's slides (Minister for the Coordination of Health and Human Services</a>. To the best of my knowledge, the actual models have not been made public, so all we have are these predictions.</p>
<p>And, well, the predictions are laughably absurd. They predict that without the state's measures, there would have been a peak of 18.5K daily cases. That's 2.9K daily infections per 1M population. <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/">Sweden</a> that is the closest example to a country doing nothing peaked at 175 daily cases per 1M population. <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/">Italy</a> which had a disastrous response peaked at 100 daily cases per 1M population. Even when not accounting for population differences, <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/spain/">Spain</a> which is the country which recorded the most daily cases in Europe peaked at 11K, half of the state's predictions for what would have happened in Victoria. <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/new-york/">New York State</a> also recorded at the maximum 11.5K <strong>total</strong> daily cases. To give one last example, the US recording 2.9K cases per 1M population would be equivalent to them having 1M cases per day. They recorded 5M cases <strong>in total</strong>.</p>
<p>Their graphs also imply a total number of cases exceeding 1M in Victoria. <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">Worldwide, this would have put Victoria in the fourth place in terms of cases</a>, between Russia and India. In addition, this means that health officers estimate that Victoria would have reached 160K cases per 1M in total. <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">Victoria would have been the country/state with most cases per 1M</a>, with four times more cases per 1M than Qatar.</p>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that health officials imposed these measures at a time when Victorians were already social distancing. For example, according to <a href="https://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/images/stories/committees/paec/COVID-19_Inquiry/Presentations_Round_2/PAEC_Presentation_-_City_of_Melbourne_-_13_August_Slides_only.pdf">p. 4 of a presentation by the Chief Executive Officer</a>, there was 7 times less pedestrian activity in the Melbourne CBD before any additional restrictions were put in place.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks for pointing this out.</p>
<p>The Australian modellers have been making ridiculous predictions from the outset. I find it hard to believe that they are that stupid. This isn't science; it's straight out pushing an agenda.</p>

        <p>Didn’t the models get released in April? I’ve emailed some scientists who were pushing for elimination as they didn’t take into account T-cell immunity.</p>
