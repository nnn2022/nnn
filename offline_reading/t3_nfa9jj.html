    <strong>Doomers Are Hypocrites</strong>
    <p><p>My body, my choice... EXCEPT GET THE FUCKING VACCINE, YOU BIGOT! AND FOR GOD SAKE, WEAR A FUCKING MASK!</p>
<p>Follow The Science‚Ñ¢... EXCEPT WEAR A MASK EVEN IF YOU'RE FULLY VACCINATED! I DON'T CARE WHAT THE CDC SAYS, IT'S TOO SOON AND I'M SCARED!</p>
<p>I had no side effects from the vaccine apart from a sore arm so that means it's harmless and there's literally zero risk of you dying from it... BUT DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE DOWNPLAY THE EFFECTS OF COVID, THAT'S JUST YOUR OWN ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE! PEOPLE ARE DYING, YOU KNOW!</p>
<p>Vaccine passports are just a conspiracy concocted by you tinfoil hat wearers... BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE VACCINE THEN YOU SHOULD BE DENIED ACCESS TO BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS! WE SHOULD SEGREGATE YOU ALL INTO CAMPS! WE SHOULD HAVE QR CODE SCANNERS FOR EVERYTHING SO THE UNVACCINATED CAN'T DO ANYTHING OR GO ANYWHERE! YOU'RE A CONSPIRACY THEORIST IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THIS!</p>
<p>Y'all are in a cult... THE GREATER GOOD THE GREATER GOOD THE GREATER GOOD.</p>
<p>The majority of you also refused to wear multiple masks when that was recommended. I guess you only care enough about Grandma's life to wear one, huh?</p></p>

        <p>It‚Äôs right in front of them. Look as a true skeptic I look at both sides. Given that I live in Canada I am looking like I am not going to have as many freedoms as Americans. We have mandatory mask orders to use stores and eventually I can see them forcing you into a vaccine. Also as someone who has a metabolic disorder that doctors recommended that I get regular flu shots every year because I got really sick once I have to consider it. I‚Äôm one of the few people that actually need vaccines and we didn‚Äôt have to shut down the world in the process..  ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è </p>
<p>I think it‚Äôs a wicked idea to coerce people into taking a vaccine that we don‚Äôt know the long time consequences of. I think preying on desperation of most people who just want to get back to normal is despicable. So we all have to sign a deal with the devil? </p>
<p>If anything it shows how the world is really run. The 1% made more money from this and they will be the class of people who are exempt from most of the rules.</p>
