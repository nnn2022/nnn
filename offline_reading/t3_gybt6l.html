    <strong>Living in a perpetual sense of threat and terror is unsustainable long-term.</strong>
    <p><p>Especially when the threat is not actually a death sentence in most cases, especially for those who are young who are seeing their lives, goals and dreams (and their years worth of efforts in their Schooling and education) be broken before them.</p>
<p>Eventually people move on because they look back and see all they have already lost, (and risk even more so if they continue) and decide - I can do so little, and now have so little to hope or plan for: What is the point of my life anymore? Why am I afraid of losing what has already been destroyed?</p>
<p>There are people who are enjoying lockdown, sure, but what about the people who have lost so much as a result of lockdown that they no longer even care if they catch the virus and die of it?</p>
<p>Why am I being "protected", when the very measures of all of that "protection" has resulted in everything in my life being destroyed?</p>
<p>I believe that what appears on the surface to those privileged enough to enjoy lockdown  as "selfish" (e.g. people protesting to go back to work, people seeing their friends and loved ones) is actually someone fighting for their life. It is someone fighting to reclaim precious freedoms and basic human needs. It could be someone fighting for their sanity. Fighting to preserve the meaning in their life necessary to care for its continuity and preservation.</p>
<p>If we render life hollow of meaning or hope, then why care about anything at all?</p>
<p>If we shame people for fighting for their right to reclaim the business they worked hard for, enjoying the company and physical touch and closeness of their loved ones, fighting to be with loved ones, then you are shaming someone for being a human being.</p>
<p>Forcing people to live in a ways so removed from nature as to seriously hurt or kill us, cannot and will not continue.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed, life has it's risks, some more worth it than others. If we live in fear forever then there's nothing that will make life worth living.</p>

        <p>Great post. I've had the very same thoughts and feelings shortly after the lockdown started. It seemed a bit easier at first when the stated goal was "flatten the curve" but then they kept moving the goal post with no end in sight except a vaccine. Not having control over one's life is a form of torture. It sickens me to think of so many dying alone because of no visits from friends and family and severely curtailed funeral services and yet it is okay, virtuous even , to assemble with thousands of protesters.</p>

        <p>I try to break the rules as much as I can get away with. The only time I wear a mask is when I am forced to, and more and more people are not wearing masks.</p>
<p>On to the next news cycle--you guys wanna go protest?</p>

        <p>It’s so depressing to feel that feeling of just “existing” not living. My state finally opened outdoor dining and retail today but with all the limitations and security theatre I feel like I won’t be going out very much.</p>

        <p>I would agree but look at North Korea. Most of those people probably live in terror but continue living anyway. I'm not supporting it, but why hasn't the population revolted yet?</p>

        <p>It’s the same reason why aren’t doomers protesting against indefinite lockdowns/social distancing - brainwashing.</p>
<p>The difference is that in the western world, we’re at least allowed to have a non-mainstream opinion despite the constant censorship, fearmongering, and silencing by mainstreamers. We also have this sub, r/lockdownskepticism, alternative media, and access to official data. In North Korea they don’t even have that option.</p>
