    <strong>It's becoming very clear the problem isn't the "elite"</strong>
    <p><p>It's the scum of the Earth, the human population.</p>
<p>The "elite" is a manifestation of the humanity who is reaping what has been sewn. Most of the world is filled with SCUM.</p>
<p>Idiots who are too stupid to EVER learn won't know what hit them when it does.</p>
<p>The arrogance of people think they know better have a bitter pill to swallow that's coming soon.</p>
<p>Selfish, greedy people who don't care about anyone else, who dig themselves into a pit of misery and blame others as they ultimately meet their demise.</p>
<p>Busy people who are too self centred focused on their own lives to even NOTICE the insanity around them. They will notice only their lives falling apart and won't see the suffering of anyone else around them.</p>
<p>Hateful stuck up people who just cause conflict with people over petty things.</p>
<p>And the obedient cowards who are too afraid to look at the truth. When the truth catches up, their worst fear will be staring them in the face.</p>
<p>I look around in BISBELIEF with really with how many people are just absolutely INSANE in this world. As I walk around in the shop, hundreds of people walking past me with masks on, CLUELESS. Surrounded by walking zombies. Is this real?!</p>
<p>And the most tragic, most heart-breaking thing of all is that had they just had the intelligence, the empathy, the awareness, the courage, the time for just ONE SECOND to LISTEN to any of us, MAYBE IT COULD HAVE ALL BEEN AVOIDED!!!!Even SOME people in this sub are scum. Thank you to the genuine people here who have the empathy, the intelligence, the awareness, the time and care to actually try to stand up and help others, despite being thrown under the rug.</p>
<p>The human population has allowed it's own mass culling.</p></p>

        <p>Here's the thing.  It's not the end of the world because this is by no means a new phenomenon.  I think you would very much enjoy reading Thornton Wilder's play "Skin of our teeth".  It's a hoot. </p>
<p>But people have always ignored the inconvenient truths.  Consider that the citizens of Pompei absolutely KNEW they were living on the side of a live volcano.  They had seen it erupt. But it was a beautiful city with a climate and soil great for winemaking. </p>
<p>Vesuvius happens.  We are still here.</p>

        <p>Have you ever noticed that conspiracy theorists have, for the entire history of time, said "the people won't know what's hit them. It's coming soon".</p>
<p>Guess what?</p>
<p>It never happens. Ever.</p>

        <p>But it‚Äôs already happened. I wasn‚Äôt even really a conspiracy theorist before last year aside from having a passing interest in stuff like Bigfoot and aliens.</p>

        <p>And why is that a problem?</p>
<p>I'm not saying things never happen. Sometimes, things are rumoured and then happen.</p>
<p>But all this doom prediction of the end of the world, and people will end up as slaves and all that bullshit, it never happens.</p>
