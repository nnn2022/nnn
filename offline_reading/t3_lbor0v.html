    <strong>Covid concentration camps are already here</strong>
    <p><p>China has built a 4,000-bed "quarantine camp".  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/china-builds-massive-covid-19-quarantine-camp-for-4-000-people-as-outbreak-continue-1.5274898">https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/china-builds-massive-covid-19-quarantine-camp-for-4-000-people-as-outbreak-continue-1.5274898</a></p>
<p>In the capital of the country's largest industrial center, Hebei Province. The province has recently been put under the most brutal fascist "quarantine". There are many plants and factories there, some of which are being shut down by the global corporations because of the global overproduction crisis (especially those producing steel, autos and oil-derivitives), and workers are being put under house arrest without pay. And all this under the guise of "fighting an epidemic".</p>
<p>"Officials in Shijiazhuang, where the outbreak is centered, have initiated mass testing and strict lockdowns, moving entire villages into centralized quarantine facilities in a bid to curb the spread of the virus."</p>
<p>"More than 20,000 citizens from 12 villages in Shijiangzhuang have since been relocated to other quarantine sites as a preventative measure, Chinese state media outlet CGTN reported last week."</p>
<p>Surely everyone knows what kind of "quarantine sites" the workers and their families were relocated to? After all, many factory workers come precisely from the countryside. </p>
<p>"On Tuesday, China reported 103 new confirmed cases and 58 asymptomatic infections, which are counted separately, spread out across four provinces. Hebei province now has a total of 818 active locally transmitted cases, and more than 200 asymptomatic infections, according to the provincial health commission."</p>
<p>Check out the "socialism" and "socialist" healthcare in China. Absolutely healthy people are declared sick and dangerous to others, just like everywhere else. You can practically poke at anyone (for example, a striking worker) and take him to a "quarantine camp".</p></p>
