        <p>The irony is we've heard nothing but "my mask protects you" for the past year and the vaccine selfishly only allegedly protects those who take it while potentially turning them into a mini-covid factory to spread to others.</p>

        <p>There's not going to be much literature on this because they likely aren't studying this aspect of it, but if you understand how the mRNA vaccines work, it's a very real possibility. There are emerging signs that indicate worrisome spread amongst vaccinated populations, here's an example: <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1385309985148710915">https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1385309985148710915</a></p>

        <p>Not the op but ill elaborate. There is a theory that vaccinated people will carry the virus unknowingly causing it too mutate into a stronger version and then passing it onto others who are more at risk. It’s happened in chicken vaccines but not humans. It’s a bid of a wild idea but I believe that’s what op is referring to.</p>

        <p>The primary purpose of masks is to protect others. They protect YOU a little. The vaccine is not 100% effective, no vaccine could probably ever be. People still wear masks because of people who are too selfish to wear a piece of cloth on their face for the 15 minutes they're in walmart</p>

        <p>In NY to go to a Mets or Yankees game you need to either be fully vaccinated for 2 weeks or have a negative Covid test that day.</p>
<p>Yet, while at the game (where EVERYONE is vaccinated or tested negative for covid) you STILL have to wear a mask and social distance and it's only 20% capacity.</p>
<p>What are we doing???</p>
<p>They basically are saying that the vaccines and tests are completely pointless if you still have to wear a mask and only have 20% capacity.</p>
<p>If EVERYONE is required to be vaccinated/negative WHY CANT IT BE 100% capacity?!?!?!</p>
<p>WHY do you still have to wear a mask?</p>
<p>I also love the fact that you can be actively sick from Ebola or Tuberculosis, but as long as you have a negative covid test you are welcome to go to the game. What is the end goal? Will we have to submit proof of negative tests for 29 different infections in the future? What the fuck is this nonsense?</p>

They also have an unblemished record of side effects aside from some minor coincidental events so inconsequential that the loving, caring, and benevolent media has chosen to defer any reporting of them until the entire population consists solely of the control group.</p>

        <p>Do it work? Regardless the CDC says you still need to wear 2 masks and social distance. We can’t return back to normal because you the vaccine doesn’t fully prevent you from catching or spreading the disease.</p>

        <p>The vaccines do work. They just don’t work the way you think they do. </p>
<p>They DO lower the likelihood that you would contract COVID from another person, however, the chances are not uncommon with a decent viral load. The vaccine also does lessen the actual symptoms of infection. You can still spread it to another person easily if you have the vaccine and conditions are right — which is not as uncommon as you would think. </p>
<p>The whole purpose of the vaccine is to train your body to fight it as soon as it gets recognized in your body. This doesn’t always happen immediately. Sometimes the virus will fly under the radar or replicate faster than it can be taken out, and as a result you become contagious. We need everyone, or at least 90 something percent, to receive full vaccine immunity to effectively stop the spread. Once a majority has it, we can go back to normal because our viral load will collectively be too small to spread.</p>
<p>And about it being experimental: the method the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use has never been done before, but it is made off the complex understanding of our body and immune system. The scientists know what they are doing. Funnily enough the vaccine that has had the most trouble is the J&amp;J one which is made using the more widely used method. And in relation to the side effects of the vaccine, that is just the body taking what was contained in the vaccine and fighting it. Side effects are common in all vaccines and it’s only proof that COVID is a much more formidable virus than we thought.</p>

<p>Really? Then why did mRNA vaccines fail aninal trials but now all the sudden they're safe for people? Not very scientific if you ask me.</p>
<p>Now they're completely eliminating the control group, conveniently as a lot of adverse reactions are being reported.  This is flat out stupid and obviously unscientific, but feel free to be a guinea pig.</p>

        <p>Was your second link the correct one? </p>
<p>Because the study doesn’t seem match your description at all, from what I can tell. The study doesn’t mention that mice became sick or more susceptible to coronavirus after vaccination. They only showed that antibodies purified from vaccinated mice made it easier for two strains of coronaviruses found in civets to enter cells in a Petri dish test. Civets weren’t even involved in the study.</p>

        <p>Each research journal you provided was published within the years of 2004-2016. These are heavily outdated to the technology we have today. Human trials would never be allowed to begin if these results were arising in animal trials, and even though the FDA has emergency authorization for the current vaccines, they would never authorize it if these results were still happening. </p>
<p>With the massive funding that has been funneled into the vaccine market due to COVID, scientific advances are not unlikely. Just look back to the space race. There have been major breakthroughs in mRNA vaccine technology.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why we shouldn’t trust Pfizer. The CEO has taken his doses of the Pfizer vaccine. And long term effects are incredibly rare in vaccines and become noticeable within weeks of receiving the vaccine. Your last point basically describes every major company in the world. I don’t get why people don’t trust the many scientists, both related to Pfizer and third parties, that have continually stated it’s safe.</p>

<p>I'm not an immunology major, but I have a basic enough understanding of the biochemistry behind the vaccine, and the CDC recommends getting vaccinated anyway. Furthermore, the vaccine will help defend against mutated forms of the virus, whereas my having had it half a year ago won't. How much do YOU know about immunology, since that seems to be your criteria for me?</p>

        <p>Ok now to point out your bullshit</p>
<p>&rt;First: No liability is because of dipshits who like to say "my cousin got the vaccine and died 3 days later!" when the death was unrelated.  </p>
<p>Interesting take, surely its not because of all the safety issues that are slowly popping up and being reported. Nah must be all the assholes wanting a quick buck.</p>
<p>&rt;Second: There is no lack of data indicating safety</p>
<p>Ok source long term studies on mrna vaccines I'll wait.</p>
<p>&rt;Third: No shit past vaccines failed, it's called advancing medicine. We don't bleed sick people anymore because we learned that it didn't work and we know why. </p>

<p>Yeah because nothing says integrity more than a few dozen class action lawsuits.</p>
<p>&rt;Fifth: You're just rewording and reusing your shitty strawmen</p>
<p>Ah yes the lack of scientific rigor with all the testing and confirmation. Like the fact that it isn't studied if the vaccine prevents transmission? Guess that's a shitty strawman indeed.</p>
<p>&rt;Sixth: I don't know what your arguing here, we're talking about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine</p>

        <p>mRNA vaccines have been researched for a long time. They only recently received a ton of funding because of the pandemic. It’s amazing what we can do when we put funding into specific places and humans have a dire need for something.</p>
<p>Edit: Also not sure what you mean by them eliminating the control group. There have been many clinical trials months before it’s release into the public.</p>

        <p>It's amazing what you can do when you rush and waive all safety requirements, and make manufacturers immune from liability.*</p>
<p>Typical vaccine timeline is 5-10 years, 3-5 if you're lucky. Vast majority of this time is clinical trials, and the majority of clinical trials fail. Even if you expedite this process there is still <strong>zero</strong> long term data on the safety of this vaccine. You can inject a bunch of people and they might be fine for a few months, but what happens 2-3 years from now? No one knows.</p>

        <p>Lucky for this case, mRNA have been researched and in developing for a long time. That timeline is with the previous vaccine creation method. With the mRNA method, vaccines can be produced within months.</p>
<p>These studies have been going on since from my knowledge at least early 2010s. They only lacked major funding to speed up the progress of their research. It’s almost like the extra funding allowed for more people to be assigned to the research as well as more attention being given to the subject. This new method has many scientists watching and validating its findings. </p>
<p>This phenomenon of faster research and progression also happened during the space race. Without a challenge or need to have it done, it would have taken decades longer. Since we had funding funneled into the right places, we had it done in much less of the time. </p>
<p>The fact that you lack faith in scientists scares me.</p>

        <p>The children getting sprayed with DDT was because of the polio outbreak. People sprayed it everywhere to kill it. Yeah it was fucked up but no actual studies had been done to determine it’s affects on the body. </p>
<p>Asbestos was used in buildings because of its cheap and sturdy characteristics. No attention was given to its actual side effects until a later cause was determined.</p>
<p>Eggs can be both good and bad. It relates to the situation you want it for. This mixed information confuses people a lot and you can’t bush it under one category of helpfulness.</p>
<p>Smoking was never advocated by doctors. All these old ads you are thinking of were done by actors (people still fall for this type of advertisement today). They never told you to smoke.</p>
<p>Science was never bought in any of these situations, and in each case you provided (besides the egg) there was never an attempt to study the affects. They just started using it without caring. Today, with vaccines there is extensive research put into the process of creating a safe vaccine. The FDA would never allow an unsafe vaccine to be approved even if is going through emergency approval.</p>

        <p>The first two are definitely news to me. Although it’s significantly more likely for a medication to have long term effects than a vaccine. Medicine messes with hormones and other things that alter the bodies natural processes. The vaccine works with the bodies natural processes and doesn’t interfere with anything. It’s also important to note that the FDA isn’t the only agency that is independently studying the effects of the vaccine. Each government has their own agency that has approved the vaccine and are still actively studying it.</p>
<p>Also these side effects are on the side of every pill bottle you buy. They are even on vitamin bottles. </p>
<p>Also that last article you linked isn’t saying anything negative about any side effects to the vaccine. All it’s saying is the big caveat of it needing to be administered before the patient becomes sexually active.</p>

        <p>For one, they're only tracking these people for a couple months before deeming the treatment safe, how does that prove long term safety?</p>
<p>And then for a specific example, the Pfizer phase 3 trials, they say it was 95% effective (even though the actual number was 94.1 iirc) but over 90% of the placebo group was uninfected as well. </p>

        <p>There are no long term side effects... once your body takes in the vaccine it treats it similarly to a virus and kills it off while remembering how to kill it. Once that happens the vaccine has no extra effects. The only side effects you will ever receive from a vaccine are natural responses from the immune system. They won’t ever release a vaccine that is too powerful for the immune system, and with the number of people that have already received it, it’s safe to say that it’s safe to take.</p>

        <p>You can't say that until a few years down the line after people have been exposed to the wild virus/variants. You have no long term data, because there isn't any. You can't because there isn't any possible way you could have that without also having a time machine and there is no prior mRNA vaccine brought to market which you could use data for either. The FDA approved it via "emergency use authorization", it remains unapproved through the typical process and will probably for years.</p>

        <p>There can’t be any long term side effects for a typical vaccine. Most side effects you will receive will either be within the hour you receive it or within the week if there are subtle problems. You won’t be affected any longer than that.</p>

It's a preprint paper, but it raises some interesting questions. In any case, we don't have long term data for this EXPERIMENTAL gene therapy. The only thing that will give us that is time. Neither you, nor anybody else, knows the long term effects of this technology. Period.</p>

        <p>Please read the first comment that appears in this article</p>
<p>&rt; as far as I can see this paper has not been able to get published, suggesting it has not been able to pass peer review. I also can't find any research that replicates the result. It is being widely used by anti-vaxxers to claim that the vaccines modify DNA, which is clearly false. Given the dangerous uses to which the paper is being put, shouldn't it either be published after peer review or withdrawn by the authors. Leaving it in limbo suggests some validity which is clearly unwarranted</p>
<p>They couldn’t have said it better. Also this wouldn’t even have anything to do with vaccinations — I can at least say for the Pfizer and Moderna. This is only talking about why you can test positive for COVID and what that means. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations don’t use any live or dead vaccine. So this wouldn’t happen in patients who receive the vaccine, it only happens to those who actually catch the virus (no where in this does it mention vaccinations)</p>
<p>I’m really curious if you actually read the paper or if you are just passing along information that you believe to help your point of view.</p>
<p>Also this clearly isn’t experimental. There has been thorough tests to make sure it’s safe.</p>

        <p>&rt;It’s amazing what we can do when we put funding into specific places and humans have a dire need for something.</p>
<p>And yet they still couldn't conduct animal trials? Weird. </p>
<p>Just because something's been studied for a long time doesn't mean it works. We still don't know how safe/dangerous gene therapy is, it's too soon. And as much as I don't want people hurt by taking this expiremental gene therapy, I haven't seen a one single study to show it's safety long term. Provide that and your case will be much stronger.</p>

        <p>It pains me to agree with you. Every source that people provide to me that supports their argument is either from a heavily biased news source, proven to be false many times over, the title draws different conclusions than the actual text of the paper, or doesn’t even support what they are saying and they read it incorrectly. But even once you tell them these things they’ll continue believing their point of view and nothing has been gained. Though I still have to try. One day there will be that one person who will listen or maybe even convince me to their perspective.</p>

        <p>YET. Keyword is yet. Because of people who doubt the vaccine or people who think COVID is a hoax or people who think COVID is just a little head cold, the pandemic won't end until a decent percentage of the country is fully vaccinated. In my state, the vaccine only became available to all adults regardless of age earlier this month. I won't be fully vaccinated for another 2 weeks or so, and as someone who HAD COVID, I would really rather not get it again</p>

        <p>Have you bothered to read the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">CDC guidelines</a>? And those are just preliminary, it will all expand as more get fully vaccinated. </p>
<p>Like, yeah, it doesn’t really change what you can legally do in the US, but that’s because there isn’t heavy-handed prohibitions in the first place.  </p>
<p>The point of getting it, as far as I understand, is to reduce the likelihood that you will be harmed by COVID-19 and/or pass it on to others, and all the population-level benefits that follow from that.</p>

        <p>Yeah no...</p>
<p>The only basis of the push is it lessens symptoms.
The data beyond that refers to the fact that Covid19 doesn't spread without symptoms. So they are in essence admitting that it doesn't spread asymptomatically.</p>
<p>As far as population benefits of the vaccine I'm waiting for a few post vaccine successful pregnancies.  The data is still out on the effects of mrna vaccines in the long term. There's still a very real possibility that these shots could effectively cripple our immune system upon repeated exposure. That's a frightening thought, being dependant on a Pharmaceutical company to release the next batch off vaccine just to live another year.</p>

        <p>Why?</p>
<p>Pre-symptomatic is testing positive before the onset of major symptoms.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic is a positive test with no onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>That's a big difference there.</p>
<p>To date there's still no record of an asymptomatic person spreading Covid19.</p>

        <p>&rt; Pre-symptomatic is testing positive before the onset of major symptoms.</p>
<p>Well, no, not quite. Pre-symptomatic is <em>being infected</em> with the virus before onset of symptoms, not testing positive. </p>
<p>&rt; Asymptomatic is a positive test with no onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>Again, not quite. Asymptomatic is being infected and never going on to develop symptoms. Which, importantly, isn’t the same as people who don’t have symptoms, even if they test positive because they could still go on to develop symptoms. </p>
<p>So while yes, asymptomatic transmission hasn’t been clearly seen (though there is evidence that suggests it does happen infrequently), it’s really a red herring. </p>
<p>What matters for public health is that pre-symptomatic spread (where people who have been infected with the virus, but don’t know it because they haven’t developed symptoms yet, spread it to others) definitely does happen and is a significant contribution to the pandemic. </p>

        <p>I've read that study.</p>
<p>And it reports that 75% of the transmission of the cluster was pre-symptomatic. It also reports that the data that was gathered was directly from the participants of the study. There's no data validation here. </p>
<p>I've read other studies that put pre-symptomatic spread at around 16% of total transmission.</p>

        <p>Care to share these other studies? I’d like to read them. </p>
<p>What kind of data validation are you looking for?</p>
<p>Like, the data obviously isn’t perfect or infallible. But it’s about as good as we can get with these sort of things, and is overall consistent with the preponderance of evidence available.</p>
<p>And even if pre-symptomatic transmission is as low as 16%, that’s still a pretty significant public health consideration, right? And that’s why the whole “there is no asymptomatic spread” narrative is a red herring.</p>
<p>Edit: also, if you’ve read that study, as well as other studies indicating significant pre-symptomatic spread, why did you say:</p>

        <p>I’m fully aware that that asymptomatic spread isn’t significant contributor to the pandemic. Thanks for the condescension.</p>
<p>The problem is that people easily confuse that with the idea that people who don’t have symptoms can’t transmit the virus, which is wrong. Hence I raise the distinction between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread. </p>
<p>The asymptomatic spread that doesn’t contribute to the pandemic has a very specific meaning. It’s people who get infected but never go on to have symptoms, and yes that group of people don’t really spread the virus. </p>
<p>But there’s another important group of people who get infected and will go on to develop symptoms but haven’t yet, and they <em>can</em> still spread the virus. That’s where pre-symptomatic spread comes in. </p>
<p>And I anticipate you’ll say that that window is really short and it barely ever happens so it doesn’t matter. But that’s wrong. </p>
<p>There’s pretty good scientific evidence that pre-symptomatic spread is a major contributor COVID-19 transmission. Here’s a recent high quality <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8007320/">example</a>. The direct contact-tracing study found “Presymptomatic transmission was more frequent than symptomatic transmission” for the studied cluster of cases in Germany.</p>

        <p>Imagine still crying over a dude who isn’t even president anymore. I’m a left leaning libertarian animal rights activist. Many of us here do not support Trump or Biden or any of these elitist puppets part of this divide and conquer circus. But honk honk 🤡 you took the bait of this psyop and are well indoctrinated. You say “black and white thinking” yet you generalized an entire group of people with out hearing them out from their perspective. Cool story bro.</p>

        <p>I’m aware however I grew up in the 80s In a rural area and was abused by the school system and put in classes with literal retarded people. I ended up teaching myself to read through very strong effort I am not perfect but I can read a book express myself and when I speak I am very articulate. But if you want to use people’s flaws they are open about to attempt to win a war with out fighting the words in context they were trying to express than you have already lost.
