    <strong>Not that it's necessarily about politics, but why are so many people who embrace the restrictions vehement about hating Trump?</strong>
    <p><p>They successfully cheated him out of a second term (or not, if you so believe) yet there is a very vocal set of people who still want to chastise, denounce, criticize him etc.  I see many comments here, and usernames to match, that openly denigrate him.  Why is that?  He's not in office now, is he still a threat to these people?  Are we talking about science or are we talking about politics?</p></p>

<p>similar to team sports 'fans' (fan-atics)</p>
<p>the 'teams' are all playing the same game, for the same owners (league), the players (and coaches, etc) move from team to team as needed. </p>
<p>the fan has no control or say in the operations of the 'team' even if they put on a hat, jersey or decorate their stuff, because they are not members of it.</p>
<p>the fans watch the 'game' and the fans pays for it all</p>

        <p>I wasn't looking forward to potential martial law at all, but anything had to be better than letting a brazen, obvious cheater occupy the presidency as if he were legitimate, especially given the plandemic and associated BS.  If any president was going to push for national mask mandates or "papers, please", it was probably going to be Biden... or rather, his handlers, because I honestly don't believe he has enough mental capacity left to be a functioning president.  Say what you want about Trump, at least he could climb stairs without stumbling and know what was in an executive order before signing it.</p>
<p>As for the non-vaccine from hell, that ranks among Trump's greatest failures.  He really let us all down by rushing that along.</p>

        <p>It is actually about politics. MSM and the Democrats only started hyping up the virus when impeachment petered out and they saw another way to get Trump. I guarantee the whole response would have been different had a Democrat been in the Shite House.</p>

        <p>I was a Trump resister, now a disaffected liberal but remember many people here who question this Covid mess are NOT Republicans. I hate both parties now. I don't trust any politicians, they are all part of the system. I think liberals in their "trust of science" and in the "division" have had their brains shut off, people do get moved into their camp and there is propaganda for each demographic.</p>

        <p>Everything is about trump. If you think back to the very first days of “covid”, the fake news didnt know which way to go on it. They were mostly warning us not to be xenophobic even though the virus came from china.  There was articles in my newspaper talking about how the nazis said the jews carried disease. My mayor went out to eat in chinatown and I think pelosi did the same. Then trump made a mistake and said 2 weeks to stop spread. Then....when Trump said we have to open back up......then and only then: thats when we got full-on “Covid”.</p>

        <p>Trump haters have very personal reasons that dont change with time ive noticed. There are the gays who dont like him bc evangelicals do, there are immigrants, and then there are just those who thought they were up on politics and that wrote off trump, and now cant admit that they were wrong.</p>

        <p>Because it has literally always been this way just no one noticed really. They pick a stance to promote publicly, ally from left or right and then push a black or white stance for the two to fight over so nothing ever gets done or the real shit is done when everyone is focused on whatever dumb Shit is highlighted. </p>
<p>The patriotic act gets extended every time this way. Riders in budget bills are another. Etc.</p>

        <p>Mostly propaganda from intelligence agencies but he did initiate the rushed vaccines and his admin did two weeks to slow the spread two months too late for it to make any difference, despite the public pushback from NIH and democrats. For those alone I'd be happy to see him publicly executed. That being said I'm glad he shattered the illusions of democracy and he did have a few good policies.</p>

        <p>Let's see:</p>
<p>Because Trump is a racist, misogynist, homophobe, transphobe, might be a rapist (numerous allegations against him that some have the ring of truth), pushes stupid policies that we have tried in the past (trickle-down) that have been proven not to work... I could keep on going here but I think you get the point.</p>

        <p>Biden fondles women and children on camera. Talked about children stroking his leg hair at the pool, on camera. Said the N-word on camera about 5 weeks ago. Accused of rape as well. Paraded around and praised a former KKK higher up; Robert C. Byrd. Eulogized Robert C. Byrd's funeral. Never accomplished anything of significant in the Senate in 47 years. Openly bullied a black man who was to become a Supreme Court justice. Believed in segregation. Openly makes racist jokes, such ass, go to a 7-11 and you'll only find Indians. He doesn't want to live in a racial jungle. Was cozy and buddy buddy with segregationists decades ago. Uses his authority to fire prosecutor in Ukraine that may have been investigating his son, by holding back foreign aid to Ukraine. Uses his family to get rich off of sweet board deals and foreign company affairs in China and the Ukraine. His son is a fucking dead beat loser and a drug addict. </p>
<p>John Kerry was talking with Iran behind the United States back making deals with their authoritarian government.</p>
<p>Maxine Waters doesn't live in her district and is consistently voted the most corrupt politician in the House. She is worth millions but is as dumb as a doorknob and has made all kinds of crooked deals.</p>
<p>Nancy Pelosi is worth tens of millions of dollars through sweet deals she made for her husband.</p>
<p>They all talk climate change but zoom around on their jets, have millions dollar mansions that use 100's time more energy than any average person. They don't practice what they preach.</p>
<p>But somehow, Trump is baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad, and Democrats goooooooood. Baaaaah Baaaah. CNN tells you so, so it has to be true. !</p>
<p>Trump is by no means anywhere near perfect and a very flawed man, but 95% of what they accuse him or, they are projecting. The federal government in Washington is full of pedophiles, satanists, and really evil, corrupt people. Wake the fuck up.</p>
