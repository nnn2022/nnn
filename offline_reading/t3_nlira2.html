    <strong>PSA: If It Was About Health</strong>
    <p><p>Since this nonsense started last year here in America, we have seen doom, and gloom news. We have misinformation, disinformation to outright lying by the media and our government to our faces. Here's the kicker, the people reporting the news know they're lying, and they know that we know they're lying. If they ever actually ever bothered to tell the truth, the media and government would implode from the shock. I hold no illusion that they are all in this scam together, scheming and planning. </p>
<p>I find it odd that they, the government, media and their collaborators talk about it is all about health, and safety, but yet you do not hear any of their mouth pieces talk about what to do to help boost your health, most importantly your immune system. Instead what is their solution? Mask up, stay home, stay glued to the television, order out, binge netflix or hulu, stay afraid, don't question anything or The Science^(TM) .</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions for good health practices that I did to stay sane, and to help keep my mental equilibrium.</p>
<p><strong>Ideas for Promoting Physical Health</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eat healthy (vegetables, greens, dairy, proteins, balanced meals, etc.)</li>
<li>Exercise (walking, jogging, push ups, sit ups, squats)</li>
<li>Drink Plenty of Liquids</li>
<li>Take Vitamins (C, D), Iron, Zinc, Calcium</li>
<li>Taking/Practicing a Martial Art (Tai Chi), Western Boxing, Kick Boxing, etc.</li>
<li>Joining a gym or buying exercise equipment</li>
<li>quit smoking</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ideas for Promoting Mental Health</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off your television</li>
<li>Turn off your cell phone</li>
<li>Turn off your computer</li>
<li>learn to program, learn a new skill</li>
<li>Visit family, friends and colleagues</li>
<li>Go for a hike, walk a trail</li>
<li>Read a book</li>
<li>Take off the mask, and smile at someone or tip your hat</li>
<li>pray, meditate, sing a favorite song, sleep</li>
</ul>
<p>While I am no doctor, physical therapist, I am quite sure most physicians would say 99% of these activities or things to do are good for you or at least are a start in promoting good health practices to help strengthen the immune system. Good luck to you, stay healthy, stay strong and remember you are not alone!</p></p>

        <p>Agree.  </p>
<p>Imagine if you got a chance to win a million dollars by attending a boxing class?  Or a yoga class? Or eating an apple?  </p>
<p>If the "health officials" cared about our "health", they would be promoting good health, not experimental vaccines.</p>
