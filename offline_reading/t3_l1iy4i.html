    <strong>There is no pandemic</strong>
    <p><p>Look up the reasons why seasonal flu is not considered a pandemic and covid clearly doesn't fit the bill either. Here are some of the attributes of seasonal flu that make it exempt from pandemic status according to the CDC. Tell me if covid doesn't fit the bill as well.</p>
<p>-Outbreaks follow predictable seasonal patterns; occurs
annually, usually in winter, in temperate climates </p>
<p>-Happens annually and usually peaks between December and February</p>
<p>-Healthy adults usually not at risk for serious complications;
the very young, the elderly and those with certain
underlying health conditions are at increased risk </p>
<p>-Health systems can usually meet public and patient needs</p>
<p>-Symptoms: fever, cough, runny nose, muscle pain.
Deaths often caused by complications, such as pneumonia. </p>
<p>-Certain people are at high-risk for serious complications (infants, elderly, pregnant women, extreme obesity and persons with certain chronic medical conditions). Healthy people are not at high risk.</p>
<p>Covid is now a seasonal flu with a 99.89% survival rate, similar to influenza, and it will likely be around forever. There is no pandemic.</p></p>

        <p>At least there's a reliable test for the flu. No quite the case with covid. In the beginning of this they were testing people for the flu before testing for Covid. That's another weird thing. They aren't doing that anymore.</p>

        <p>Yeah. The funny thing is back when there was less 'science' people were perfectly capable of discerning themselves whether they were sick or not. Now we need a test to tell them that.</p>
<p>But what I don't get is if people are convinced that they can be ill without any symptoms then why do they care about infecting anyone else either - infecting them with this non-symptomatic illness.</p>

        <p>It’s basically the media turned a flu into worldwide headline news for the last year... what were they hiding? 
Answer: the economy and fiat money are smoke and mirrors coming to their endgame. Hence the sudden “coin shortage” by the federal reserve. They’re trying to do a transition to central bank digital currencies and reset the finance system. Hoping to distract people with a hyped up flu as a mask (pun intended) to cover it up and keep people from focusing on what they’re doing.</p>

        <p>I've watched a ton of these videos, and one of the things they have in common, by and large, is folks being filmed stumbling from a bathroom to a bed or across a room into a chair, etc. People can't stumble when having full body spasms. Many are fake, or exaggerated. You'll notice that these posts and videos come from individuals associated with antivaccination movements, not clinical results.</p>
<p>Not to mention, even if they were real, which they generally aren't, the probability of a negative outcome from a vaccine is extremely small. Anyone making life decisions based on seeking or avoiding improbable events such as vaccine injuries, winning the lottery, or getting eaten by a shark, is living an irrational life.</p>

<p>Please tell me you see the irony in this statement. As the whole country and most of the world spent an entire year of their lives without travel, visiting friends and family, LIVING THEIR LIFE for fear of an extremely small chance of dying of covid. We only have so many years, and we've all just wasted one. Are we going to waste another?</p>

        <p>The best way to answer this is to point out that what we have lost is irrelevant. viruses do not care how many plane trips you didn't take or how many reunions we didn't get to go to. It will not go away by itself magically. You only have to look to the past to any other pandemic that we have endured to see that is true.</p>
<p>Given the fact that any random infected person in any part of the globe can quite easily travel thousands of miles within a span of hours unimaginable to our ancestors and reignite plague in a land that is formally contained in, should give you pause in your way of thinking. It is not an extremely small chance of dying, it is 20 times more deadly than the flu overall. It does permanent organ damage to the vascular system, the heart, lungs, brains, etc, even if you don't die, and in many cases even if you don't have a severe infection.</p>
<p>We will be feeling the repercussions of the diminished health of millions of people across the globe in addition to the death toll for decades to come. And people refusing vaccines social distancing and mask guidelines in order to return ignorantly to their lives because they are too short of patience or foresight to hold a line will result in hundreds of thousands, if not millions of unnecessary deaths. So yes, I plan to continue being responsible, regardless of how long it takes.</p>

<p>Now replace "viruses" with "heart disease" or "cancer", and you will have begun to understand my point of view. Then replace millions of deaths with billions, because both cancer and heart disease kill so much more than covid. Trying to ban travel to stop the spread of covid is silly. You're not going to stop it, at best you'll slow it a bit, but at what cost? Wait until you see the eviction numbers next month. And remember all those people starving to death in Africa? How do you think they'll fare this year?</p>

        <p>The irony of someone mentioning that correlation does not equal causation, given the content of the original post, is intense. Negative outcomes for vaccines are exceptionally rare, positive benefits are well documented. Any person making life choices based on seeking or avoiding highly improbable circumstances, like winning the lottery, getting eaten by a shark, or having a quote unquote vaccine injury, are irrational at their core.</p>

        <p>As I mentioned in my previous comments, contracting COVID-19 on its own leads to negative health outcomes for many individuals, some or many of which may be long-lasting or lifelong in their damage, excluding death. I'm addition to that, dying from COVID-19 is orders of magnitude more likely than being harmed by the vaccine, in any way.</p>
<p>I doubt anyone dedicated to believing vaccines are dangerous, despite lowering human mortality incredibly, is going to be swayed by what I'm saying. But any uninformed person stumbling onto this thread at least deserves factual information.</p>

        <p>Sure, maybe Covid has long lasting lifetime effects, but we don't know. Maybe an mRNA vaccine can have long lasting lifetime effects on someone's immune system, we just don't know. One needs to weigh their own risks/benefits for themselves for one or the other. I personally am wary of an mRNA vaccine that's never been tested before in human beings. With Covid being such a low risk for my age group and being a healthy individual, for me the risk of vaccine effects outweigh the benefit of getting it. But not everyone is the same.</p>

        <p>MRNA vaccines have been in development and various trials for over 30 years. The fact that they haven't been rolled out in a large-scale public vaccination program does not mean that they have not been studied or that we don't have information about how they would affect humans.</p>
<p>I'd like to point out a common misconception that people have about masks and vaccines, you are not getting a vaccine or wearing a mask to protect yourself. True, it does provide some protection for the individual. But the point is community protection, just like covering your mouth to sneeze prevents aerosolizing germs that other people will contract.</p>
<p>You may contract covet given your age group and blood subtype being low risk and not even have symptoms, but that doesn't protect all the various individuals that you could be passing it along to. We have known the solution to pandemics since the last time we had one in 1918, you can read the exact same editorials and newspapers then about people arguing over social distancing and mass usage.</p>
<p>Those that do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.</p>

        <p>This is a novel widespread use of mRNA vaccinations on a global scale. Yes it's been worked on for three decades, small stage 1 and 2 trails have taken place before about ten years ago, but now suddenly within a year pushed through full human trials and delivered all over the world. No one knows the long term effect of mRNA in the human immune system and I'd rather not gamble and find out 50, 60 years from now what if anything it has done. To the second point show me where the Covid vaccines stop community spread? Where have you heard getting the vaccine makes you less contagious? I know this is true for many other vaccines, but it hasn't been proven yet the Covid vaccines actually prevent a person from being contagious and infecting others</p>

        <p>Why would you assume that MRNA vaccines would function any differently in the human genome than they would any other mammal of which we have many of trials over decades to draw from for reference? As to the second point I'm not really sure what you're talking about, mechanism for this vaccine as identical to other vaccines, creating an immune response to prevent infection on a level of sufficient to lead to significant viral shedding, which would lead to infection of others. I don't understand why you would think that would be any different than a person developing natural antibodies. </p>
<p>For a lay person to use their own barely informed judgment to countermand medical advice from the greatest researchers across the planet who are in unison regarding the necessity of a wide scale uniform vaccination acceptance within countries to prevent never-ending waves of this pandemic is borderline misanthropic. It is the perfect example of the petulance of modern society and the overemphasis on individual empowerment to the detriment of not only common sense but the disregard of scientific consensus, which is the same reason we are in the sixth mass extinction event in Earth's history and facing irrevocable climate change that is significant portion of humans continue to pretend doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>You like to throw out a thesaurus of smart sounding words to sound intelligent and knowledgeable but you still haven't shown that being vaccinated prevents infecting others. No one other than you or other misinformed people is claiming that the vaccine does such. Yes it prevents Covid symptoms in 95% of vaccinated people, which is great. But there is no evidence it prevents infection to others, ie. Makes the vaccinated individual less contagious to others. I'm not sure what you don't understand about that. You are not taking the Covid vaccines "for others". You are taking the Covid vaccine for yourself. In that sense it's not as self righteous as "I wear a mask for others, not myself". I mean not even the vaccine manufacturers are making that claim, I'm not sure why you are</p>

        <p>They're is no evidence that being vaccinated does not inhibit transmission. They're only two possibilities, the first being that like nearly any other vaccine that generates significant immune response within a person to prevent illness, that it will inhibit transmission, as well as protect individuals from developing illness themselves. The second is that it will only protect, or primarily only protect, the receiver of the vaccine. In neither case is there any argument to be made from a public health and safety perspective for not taking the vaccine. There is no upside to making an assumption, that there is not a benefit toward reduction of transmissibility in the populace, regardless of whether the effect is pronounced or not. You want to call someone misinformed, you should be discussing the comments of individuals claiming that the virus doesn't exist or is a simple flu, or that the pandemic is not real. Spending your time splitting hairs over the efficacy of a public health response endorsed by literally every health organization in the world is disingenuous.</p>

        <p>I'll point out that your premise is incorrect, regardless of whether or not the vaccine inhibits transmission into others. A person who does not take the vaccine and falls ill uses up health resources, ventilators, ICU beds, medication, etc. There is a finite supply of both supplies, and provider care capacity within our country. Every person who does not protect themself via all means available to them from infection and developing symptoms is willingly and selfishly increasing the risk for other individuals who may need those services or supplies, whether it is for a covid-19 related illness or something else, as simple as trauma care. So taking the vaccine is very much about protecting the community, in any scenario.</p>

        <p>I've been following the underground news ever since they started the injections and so far 100+ people reported dead just from those few sources. Also I've heard 5 reports of children dying due to mask use.</p>

        <p>You're referring to individuals that were exceptionally elderly and incredibly medically frail, individuals that might not have been fit enough to even receive the vaccine in the first place. They are reviewing their protocols for determining which people are well enough to get vaccinated now, but there is no evidence to conclude that the vaccine itself caused the deaths, though it is possible the symptomology from side effects contributed, given how incredibly sick and elderly those people were. These are people so old and sick that getting diarrhea can kill them.</p>

        <p>I’d suggest it might also be possible that these same vulnerable people could have died from COVID if they’d caught it so would they have been better off taking their chances? California have had to pause vaccination too due to high numbers of adverse reactions. Food for thought.</p>

        <p>Those who recommended the vaccine to everyone - the medical consensus you praise so highly - did not appear to predict the deaths of these frail people from the vaccine.  What else did they not predict?  I dread to think.  Time will tell.</p>
