    <strong>Would you guys follow these restrictions if the disease spreading was more serious, like Ebola?</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t mean this as a question to provoke or start a fight, I’m just wondering. I’m with you guys on this covid stuff. </p>
<p>I remember the 2014-16 Ebola outbreak. It was horrendous. Around 30,000 people got it and around 10,000 died. I forgot the exact numbers but those are close enough. I believe to some degree it was airborne because so many people got it, but everyone said it could only spread through bodily fluids. It even got to the United States through that one guy who went from West Africa to Dallas. Ebola is a horrible, painful disease that kills lots of its victims.</p>
<p>What I ask now is, would you follow the same wear a mask, social distance, all that if it was a disease like Ebola? Personally I don’t like doing all of that but I would because healthy young adults like me are at greater risk with more deadly diseases. Ebola was a true threat, but no one took it this fucking seriously. I know it never really spread to the US but Jesus Christ almost no one I know was worried. I’m a bit of a prepper myself and I thought shit was going to hit the fan when it got bad over there.</p></p>

        <p>It never occured to me that they could shut the world down. I think if they had made masks optional, people would probably wear them more. The governments want us infighting and the discourse.</p>

        <p>I think our elected officials either A) are desperate to show they are the reason the virus is receding or B) are trying to show how much control they can have by issuing mandates -- flexing is apparently a sign of good leadership in their minds.  Maybe it is both...</p>

        <p>Or C), our elected officials know that there is nothing that they can do about this, but restrictions and mask mandates and such are a way to make it look like they're doing something in order to look good for their constituents.  Plus that keeps the narrative that this is a DANGEROUS SITUATION when it's constantly in everyone's face.</p>

        <p>The thing is it's nothing like Ebola. You can throw out hypotheticals all you want but this is a much milder disease not warranting these measures. Hell, I was in Dallas during the Ebola scare and everything was business as usual.</p>

        <p>Yes I know the diseases are completely different. I’m asking if ebola was spreading in the US, would you feel differently about these mask mandates and restrictions due to it being a much more severe disease?</p>

        <p>Honestly, even if COVID killed 33% of the people it infected I don't think mask mandates and restrictions would be necessary. People given the right information are generally very good at considering risk and taking appropriate precautions.   </p>
<p>Honestly in the event that COVID was as contagious and had a similar death rate, I'd probably take pretty drastic measures. Relocating out of the city, stocking up on dry / canned foods, survival equipment etc. I don't think any government mandates would help with that other than using the military for delivery of supplies. I don't think that the virus would last very long with such a high death rate because of peoples actions and the fact its killing its vehicle of transmission at such a significant rate.</p>

        <p>Ebola did spread as far as it could in the United States. Even with minimal measures, it never really left Dallas and maybe a couple other areas. No masks, no Lockdowns, no bullshit. When a disease is that deadly, you don't need government intervention to motivate you.</p>

        <p>Isn't it pretty obvious when somebody has Ebola and is contagious though?  And isn't that why it didn't spread in the same way as something as mild as SARS-Cov-2 does?</p>

        <p>According to a quick Google search, "The Ebola virus is transmitted among humans through close and direct physical contact with infected bodily fluids, the most infectious being blood, faeces and vomit."</p>
<p>So in other words, as long as you're not contacting body fluids, you're good.  It doesn't transmit via droplets or the air.</p>

        <p>If Ebola became a pandemic we wouldn't be doing those things at all. We'd be doing things that actually work because there'd be a real threat of mass death. And I think people would go along with those things because most don't want to die- especially from Ebola.</p>
<p>Think about it. We wouldn't have to mandate masks and lockdowns if COVID19 were really scary and if those things really worked to stop it from spreading. People would do such things voluntarily.</p>

        <p>Ebola is too fatal to spread as quickly and outbreaks typically occur in areas that have experience with it. So they already have a plan in place, which keeps it from getting too out of hand.</p>
<p>Honestly if ebola was somehow able to spread quickly while maintaining its high fatality rate I think people wouldn’t need any mandates to convince them to stay inside.</p>

        <p>No. I mean ,I would take extra precautions for myself and my family but I would still think it's horrifically unjust to enforce restrictions on others. I mean, when I didn't know much about Corona, and we first locked down, I still didn't keep my kids from playing with other friends or make them wear masks. I just really enforced hand washing, cleaned with bleach nonstop,  and fixated on my family's health (making sure my kids were eating fruit and vegetables and protein, getting enough sleep , and playing outside all day to get vitamin d and to be strong. In the beginning my husband also insisted on long, fun hikes to strengthen the kids breathing and lungs in case they got it. We did the opposite of staying inside. We just were VERY clean and sanitized everything, and for the first month we told them if they play with friends, its fine but do it outside and wash your hands every 30 minutes and do not share food or drinks.  I'd be way more worried and more of a clean freak with ebola but these restrictions would hurt more than help, even if it was the plague.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't do anything different. Ebola, HIV, flu, sars all the same approach. I wouldn't lockup, masked, limit personal affairs, or care if someone comes in close proximity. What I take seriously is my immune system. But that's me.</p>
<p>Some people believe protection for them is the best course, good luck with that.</p>

        <p>I probably would have, assuming that it helped.  However if such a disease happened now, I wouldn’t believe anything from “official sources “ after how badly they f**cked this up.</p>
