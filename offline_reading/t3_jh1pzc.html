<p>We have several times higher cases and more (claimed) hospitalizations in my state today than at the April peak. We've had mandatory masks forced on us since July. </p>
<p>Not only did they not work, they seem to have caused a massive resurgence of the virus. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

        <p>Is it possible that cases were just already spiking? Viruses spread exponentially, so how do we know that the single contributing factor to that spike in cases were masks? We also increased testing rates around that time, so it's very likely that the the increase in cases was contributed by the general curve of infections, and us testing more people when countries started making laws to combat the virus. It's definitely possible for the virus to get on the surface of your mask, and if you touch it, it can get on your hands. However, this is why you're also supposed to avoid touching your face (where most access points like eyes, mouth, nose etc are) and wash your hands often. You're also supposed to throw out the mask after use, (or wash it depending on material). The outside world has way too many variables for us to be able say one cause (mask mandate) is directly affiliated to increasing infection rate. Maybe it does actually do the opposite of intended, but we really don't have any tangible proof aside from gut feelings, and half baked theories fueled by confirmation bias.</p>

        <p>I agree that masks don't work and should never have been mandated, but seatbelts were mandated to protect others from you becoming a human projectile in the case of a crash that might not have killed anyone. There was a graphic ad campaign about it.</p>

        <p>That's right. I've had people compare mask mandates to seat belt laws to me and my response is always "well I don't agree with seat belt laws either". I know what the risk is by getting in the car and driving, it should be my choice whether I put the seat belt on or not, not the government's. They can highly encourage them all they want, but in the end it should be my choice. Same with the masks.</p>

        <p>I know, right? (I don't actually have strong feelings about seatbelt mandates, but your argument makes a lot more sense than Mayor Pete's). I didn't consider myself a libertarian before, but seeing the government grab and abuse power like this has turned me into one.</p>

        <p>I agree.  There is a very small risk that someone not wearing a seatbelt will become a meat missile and kill me.  Possible, but not at the top of my list of concerns.  More likely than not, the person not wearing the seatbelt will bear the brunt of that decision, and I am fine with them making that risk assessment for themselves.  I will wear my seatbelt as I feel it is a great safety feature of my car.  I do not want to wear a mask all the time for numerous reasons, including weak evidence in support of mask wearing, more compelling evidence against mask wearing, the potential for bacterial pneumonia, and the fact that I find masks creepy, dehumanizing, and a barrier to important social interaction and development (especially in young kids).</p>

        <p>This stuff makes me want to scream.  NEVER have people been forced to wear a homemade mask that has undergone no safety testing, that is made with no guidelines or supervision, over their MOUTH for hours at a time.  There is NO WAY OF KNOWING whether this is actually safe in the long-term because no one has done anything to ensure that it is safe!  We have no idea whether there could be negative long-term health effects of this.  It is so absurd and evil.  The surgeon example is preposterous - those are trained professionals wearing masks in sterile environments and changing them frequently.  They also aren't buying them from your new age friend who sells shit on etsy.</p>
<p>If in ten years, there are any negative effects on my health from having been forced to do this against my will despite my having been aware that the studies didn't justify it and that there had been no effort made to ensure that it was safe other than copy/pasting some bs spread by idiot influencers through twitter, I am going to sue the living shit out of every person and governmental body who has anything to do with these mandates.</p>

        <p>omg, made by a very nice person who checks her horoscope every day and charges her crystals.  I'm engaging in hyperbole obviously, but seriously... if they really thought "face coverings" worked, wouldn't they have a lot more standards for them?  Like, you would have to have training to make them and there would be inspections to ensure they were being made to meet standards.  Studies would have been done on the effect on human health of wearing a "face covering" for eight hours a day for weeks at a time.  It wouldn't be some doctor testing his oxygen levels for five minutes while going for a run or whatever.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I don't think it'll be gone after election. But I did some shopping yesterday and today, and suddenly there has been a huge decrease in mask wearing in stores. It used to be you might see 3-5 people in all of Walmart with no mask. This week it seems for every 3 people I saw, at least one had no mask on.</p>
<p>It has certainly been trending down for a while, and I don't know what happened but it seems all the sudden here people are really starting to dump the new normal. I expect it to continue as more and more people are out shopping without them.</p>

        <p>No a seat belt is designed to protect you in peice of glass and steel hurtuling down the road at 60-100 miles an hour.While 100million other pieces of glass and steel are hurling down the road as well.If you go your whole life without getting in some kind of wreck your beating the odds.So a seat belt can actuly save your life...a mask probobly not.</p>

        <p>I never wear a seatbelt, I live in the developing world, I'd rather be killed instantly when flung through the windscreen than be trapped in a car dying by inches for hours as the lack of emergency services take their sweet time to arrive without the right equipment to get me out of the vehicle without killing or maiming me in the process. </p>
<p>I don't wear a mask either outdoors even if it is mandatory here. They can fuck off. And so can Buttigieg, which is what I told him on Twitter too.</p>

        <p>Remember when these laws were enacted and their opponents said if the principle was conceded we'd never see the end of it? Well, we're now seeing their vindication. The same people who all said it was absurd to imagine that they'd ever take a mile if they were given an inch are now taking a mile. Since they were obviously lying, I propose we punish them by repealing all these "safety" laws including the seat belt mandates. If all the people who they think will die affect them as deeply as they claim they do maybe they'll then think twice before they lie to the people again. We need to send a strong message that defrauding the people will not be tolerated and will carry consequences.</p>

        <p>The final judgement on whether masks become permanent will probably depend on whether there’s an uptick in usage after the Biden mask mandate goes through. </p>
<p>With the exception of a few red state holdouts, legally in most states you currently can’t visit any indoor business without a mask and it’s been that way for a while. The degree of enforcement pretty much varies between state lines though.</p>
<p>If more people comply with the Biden mask mandate, it’s gonna be permanent. There’s no scenario where we come out of this pandemic with the health experts saying “we can all breathe a sigh of relief, go have fun”. I have no doubt they’re gonna say something along the lines of “We need to stay vigilant all the time, because another pandemic could always be around the corner”. When Fauci says we need some level of health measures going forward along with the Covid vaccine, I have no doubt that includes mask mandates that are actually enforced.</p>

        <p>It’s not about the breathing or the glasses fogging up. Your face is your primary means of nonverbal communication. Preventing strangers from being able to connect at a glance is a major dehumanization technique. People who cannot communicate effectively become anxious. Anxious people become scared. Scared people obey blindly. The masks aren’t the endgame, here- starving your connections with others is. This isn’t the beginning of this agenda, nor is it the end.</p>
