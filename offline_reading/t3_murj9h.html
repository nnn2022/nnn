    <strong>Canada's Covid Scam, The Great Reset</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone who followed the governments oreders to stay home, or was feared into it last year now owes the Canadian government 30%-100% of what they were "given" for CERB in taxes, or full repayment. EI, a tax free employment insurance already paid by the working people dosent even exist anymore, and was replaced by the taxable covid-19 respnose benefits. 
 Small businesses last year were forced hand the ownership of their companies to the government in order to have them stay open, and now they are all forced to close regardless. 
Right as of now UBI is being debated as a permanent measure in Canada that will replace CERB granting "everyone" $2000/month from the government for "equal distrubution of wealth". The catch is that will be only given to people that make less than $33,000/year. Everyone who makes more then $33,000/year will still have to pay taxes on UBI as if they are on it. If the bill is passed, UBI going to cause people to quit their jobs, because not working makes them more money than working at minimum wage. They will leech off the working people and cuase their taxes to be raised only to result in the elimination of the middle class, mass poverty, and inflation while the government gets rich. The people who think the money is "free" are going to get a big dose of reality when it comes to tax season, and it will be impossible for them to afford the governments cut of what theyare "given".
It's all a mafia style shakedown of the econemy. Trudeau's Canada is becoming a socialist's utopia. This is The Great Reset.</p></p>

        <p>Oh yeah. All the people who were making good money, who lost their jobs have to do this shi now. For example, If someone was making 10k a month and because due to economy, they lost it they will only make 2k now. And, overnight all the good income people are in the poor class now. It's all fked.</p>

        <p>Exactly. So I legit dgaf anymore. Our degrees and whatever is all worthless now. We can't get rich in this economy, and I know many truly wealthy people in my area. Their restaurants and businesses have closed down and they are fked aswell. The common man who has couple million but no power, literally cannot do anything.</p>
<p>I really see myself moving to like Texas or Idaho or something. Atleast there I will have my mental sanity, meet like minded people and be active and look forward to something. We all going crazy here. Nothing to even do and there is literally nothing to look forward to anymore. (Career, wealth wise). We are all screwed in 1 way or another.</p>

        <p>Well, ei hasn't disappeared. I was on it for a couple months instead of cerb during the big panic, took a bit of effort to get that instead but was worth it because I didn't want to be taxed on what they gave me. </p>
<p>Ubi is ridiculous, if they give that out it needs to be for absolutely everyone no matter what you make per year. If this happens I'll have no problems keeping apprentices on minimum wage. Minimum wage would go from 29k a year to 53k with that UBI giving 2k a month on top of what the wage is. Giving somebody a raise of even $2 an hour would disqualify them from UBI so thats 24k a year gone immediately after a raise. Being pro UBI is basically saying you never want more than minimum wage for the rest of your life.</p>

        <p>The main reason why UBI has failed every time in history is that it discourages people to work. No workers resutls in no stuff. </p>
<p>That sad part is that a large percent of people working minimum wage don't expect themselves to do any better and advance their lives. In all work enviroments there are people that have been stuck in their same minimum wage job from 5-30 years. When I worked in the fast food industry years ago there were people that quit their job because they were not happy, and then went to the same enviroment and pay at another location. The process repeats itself over and over with that midset of not advancing in any way. </p>
<p>The government and corporations loves seeing people in that hopeless downwards spiral, and will take advantage of them to push their political adgenda and finacial gains in cheap labor. It is completely avoidible by providing people with proper education in school on how to become successful after graduation to strengthen the econemy, but is not part of the curriculm.</p>

        <p>It was taught when I was in high-school, I graduated in 2013. We had all sorts of mandatory planning classes that showed how to do taxes, build a resume, investigate careers that interest you and present to the teacher how you could go about succeeding in your chosen field. The thing was, nobody gave a crap and paid attention in those classes. I see people I graduated with complaining on social media constantly about how school never prepared them for adulthood, meanwhile I was in that class with them.</p>
<p>People in general are just lazy by default, myself included. I'm lucky I got addicted to some very expensive hobbies young, and my parents refused to pay for anything so I learned how to work a ton to pay for what I enjoy doing. I had to start paying for my own ski pass and equipment once I started high-school, so I had a part time job at 13/14 and then later got into trucks and shooting.. so here I am 26 years old doing fairly well financially, out of a need for cool expensive equipment that I have been wanting since I was young.</p>
