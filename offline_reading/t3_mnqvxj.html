    <strong>I realize the difference between us and them.</strong>
    <p><p>I was thinking today about this sub, how and why we found ourselves here, and how we can have <em>the same information</em> as the Doomers, and yet come to an <em>entirely</em> different conclusion. </p>
<p>We already know that the overwhelming majority of users here are highly educated. And while I do not believe that alone is the difference, I believe it does make a difference.</p>
<p>Both us and the Doomers are able to receive information, of course. But the difference between us and them, is we are able to <em>process</em> that information.</p>
<p>I have found myself so frustrated with how willfully ignorant, and just flat out stupid, the Doomers <em>choose</em> to be.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, it is a choice to remain ignorant. </p>
<p>We need to figure out, as a group, how to overcome that ignorance, and find a way to convey the very clear information that they choose not to process or analyze.</p>
<p>I realise this does not take into account the pervasive mental illness that most Doomers are suffering from, and I'm not sure what we can do about that.</p>
<p>But I know there are many, many people out there that are simply just cowards, and deep down they know that this is a scam, and they just need perspective and the feeling of safety in numbers.</p>
<p>I'm just thinking out loud, but surely, with all of the education we have among us, we can find a <em>logical, intelligent</em> way to help them see the truth???</p></p>

        <p>I had this same thought. How can anyone read 99.7% survival rate and come away from that scared!? How can that number possibly be interpreted as a threat? But mind control is a powerful tool, I've come to realize and if you're coupling that with the news constantly telling you that you will kill grandma, then nothing else matters.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't consider myself highly educated. The baffling thing is most of my friends that are highly educated are the Doom and Gloom crowd. It's nuts</p>
