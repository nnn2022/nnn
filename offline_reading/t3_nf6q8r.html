    <strong>What bothers me is.</strong>
    <p><p>I am confounded by the gulf of perception between people who 'believe' and those who do not. I would like to understand how they cannot see the obvious destructiveness and malevolence of their new 'religion'.  </p>
<p>What bothers me.</p>
<p>Is that when I look at the TV, I ask myself - who is this material/presentation intended to interact effectively with? It impresses me most powerfully, that such material as is routinely presented, is very obviously and blatantly designed for people who do not know anything. It is for people who know nothing. It is for people who are not competent. It is for people who are deficient. Several critical positive attributes must be absent or minimal in a body; If the presentation is to function as intended; Judgement, analysis, discrimination, intuition, induction, sensitivity to sincerity and authenticity - all such - must necessarily be negated and abolished prior to the toleration, the submission and the consent to the natural imaginative ideation being crudely, viciously and brutally driven, coerced and overwhelmed into an ideological and religious/evangelical creed of compliance, servitude and sacrifice - and so such a state of a consuming totality of terror prevails - a case in which - the absolute selflessness of a necessarily destroyed identity is perquisite.</p></p>

        <p>Best post I've seen here in a while, thanks. Yes, all of the personal and psychological defenses humans should have regarding identifying and refuting falsehoods are negated by one thing only, the black mirror we call TV. </p>

        <p>What is on the TV - is material that is designed to suit the condition and the degree and stage or state of development/degeneration of the target audience. I cannot call them human. I have seen what they are watching. I call them murderous, insane, lustful, vain, blind, dangerous and evil.</p>

        <p>I think it is dangerous to regard "audiences" as not human. There is always potential to change,  no matter how bad it looks. </p>
<p>We all have the same weakness and are vulnerable to the same measure of persuasion.  In this case, some people would rather be sold acceptance than the truth. It's a seductive argument.</p>

        <p>I told a colleague that the vaccine is on trial until 2023. It is mRNA - not a traditional vaccine - it has never been successfully applied to a corona virus - and that the long term risks are unknown since there has not yet been a long term trial. Just facts. Now she won't speak to me. That is dangerous to say the least.</p>

        <p>There is a reason they don't teach us critical thinking in schools, or if they do, very rarely and in optional classes. Critical thinking is very important if you want to create a great society. Look at how much time, money and energy is wasted on bullshit topics. But they want us to remain unquestionning and mindless so we are easier to manipulate and control.</p>

        <p>"people who do not know anything. It is for people who know nothing. It is for people who are not competent. It is for people who are deficient."</p>
<p>You answered it yourself.</p>
<p>I mean I could add some more angles, such as the "speed of life" has accelerated so much through the internet that people simply dont have time/interest in a lot of things.</p>
<p>But essentially it comes down to a lack of empathie. Whether that is caused by illwill or caused by ignorance, in the end it is the lack thereof.</p>
<p>Combine that with a culture that cultivates island talents and considers anyone (themselves included) incapable of doing anything that isnt their proven island talent.</p>
<p>An example, 10 years back, it was absolute standard within my peers to help each other out when moving houses. You would call up some friends and have a day of hard work followed by some drinking and a fun evening. Theses days the standard is to call a moving company, because "its too much stress", "we might break something"...</p>
<p>And while there is a certain truth to that, people completely forget that they have to work extra now to pay off the moving company. They may also be less spendable hosts for a while because "the move was so expensive". And suddenly instead of a stressfull day, they have stressfull months.</p>
