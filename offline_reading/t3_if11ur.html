        <p>Let me guess without reading first, it’s probably something like this:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People who don’t wear masks are less likely to care about authority.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who have sociopathic traits are less likely to care about authority.  </p>

<li>
<p>Therefore people who don’t like masks are sociopathic.</p>

        <p>I'm not in research, I've been involved in research and done my own study but only during my degrees. I'm in clinical practice. I don't yet have been a decade behind me. I don't have much power, researchers I know from my university were trying to call out the lockdowns as harmful but no one would give them a voice. My friend who has decades of both research and clinical practice and has been part of public health policies with the government before, even tried with some colleagues of hers to make a difference but it fell on blocked ears. </p>
<p>I don't think sharing it on Facebook makes much difference.</p>

        <p>This is getting beyond disturbing.  It was sitting at 50k+ up votes on the front page of r/science. I thought MSM was bad but almost everyday on reddit there is a front page post demonizing those of us who disagree with lock downs, mask mandates, school closures, etc.</p>
<p>This is the way the media and associated groups do things. Paint your enemy as sub human.  It's a lot easier to sell war and hatred when the enemy is a terrorist, or now grandma killers/idiots who only care about themselves.</p>
<p>I'm just a guy who fears for what the future holds for me and my family.  I don't agree with the way the government and many others are doing to "fight the virus". They overreach and do not give back.  If we give things up they'll take more and more.  One day we might regret how much we took for granted and gave up.  If I knew for a fact things would go back to normal I might feel differently but I will not accept a new normal.</p>

        <p>Here's an excerpt from my <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hosvhw/an_updated_critique_of_the_twopronged_idea_that_a/">long post on masks</a> that speaks to the issue of morality &amp; masks: </p>
<p>Pro-maskers hope to help crush the "curve", whereas anti-maskers hope to help flatten the fear: 
&rt;Wearing [a mask] for show makes me complicit in something I know not to be true (not the reality of the virus, but rather the wisdom of the broader public health strategy since March). It plays into a hysteria that I will not be a part of or endorse. I want people to see I'm not scared to perhaps give them a bit more courage, as well. (Redditor PlayFree_Bird) </p>
<p>Note that being anti-mask is not a selfish or anti-social stance: anti-maskers have ethics and values, just like pro-maskers do, but in their ethical system they rank higher the importance of: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Flattening the collective fear/mass hysteria</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Affirming the central value of normal human relations: "<a href="https://culturalanalysis.net/2020/08/05/de-facing-victoria/">mask wearing is degrading our human relations</a>: that which made human life worth saving in the first place...Face masks efface us"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defending civil liberties/fighting government overreach </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Respecting only evidence-driven public policy (i.e. refusing to be part of a charade)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The latter point has two aspects to it: (4.a.) some anti-maskers are aware that we do not have any strong evidence that cloth masks for the general public in nonhealthcare settings are effective (hence mandating them undermines the integrity of the scientific enterprise, basic respect for facts, and the principle of effectiveness in public health policy); (4.b.) other anti-maskers argue that even if masks were known to be effective, using them would be counter-productive because the best strategy is to get faster to herd immunity by encouraging low-risk demographics to live normally. Martin Kulldorff, a Harvard Medical School professor of infectious disease outbreaks and vaccine safety, has spoken to this issue on <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/herd-immunity-is-still-key-in-the-fight-against-covid-19/amp?__twitter_impression=true">8th August 2020</a>: </p>
<p>&rt;As a society we should appreciate young adults who help generate herd immunity by living normal lives and keeping society afloat. Thank you, thank you, thank you. <strong>When people throw misguided complaints at you, falsely claiming that you are endangering others, remember that the opposite is true</strong>. </p>
<p>Professor Udi Qimron, Head of the Department of Immunology at Tel Aviv University, said the same on <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/285341">16th August 2020</a>: </p>
<p>&rt;I would also ask children and young people to take off their masks. </p>
<p>Going out in public without a mask can be a scientific, political, and moral statement that many of us choose to make even at the risk of being bullied by the pro-mask <a href="https://jordanschachtel.substack.com/p/the-cult-of-masks">cult</a>. Genuinely selfish people would find it less costly to just wear the damned mask, even if they didn't believe it works.</p>

<p>Imagine singling out the single best-armed (though admittedly currently disjointed) army to ever exist on God's green earth and using every media/money/PSYOP force at your collective disposal to vilify them, and thinking it's going to end with them laying down their arms and taking a vaccine from a bunch of pedophile technocrats.</p>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_P._Schwan The FCC adopted Schwan's "power flux density limits" of non-ionizing radiation exposure. They would use certain frequencies (sonic, radiowave, and microwave) on the german population to great effect, and it is even easier today since most people are permanently attached to a tool capable of this.(Smartphone) Here is how Goebbels did it https://daily.jstor.org/an-affordable-radio-brought-nazi-propaganda-home/ "Volksempfänger" "People's receiver."</p>
<p>Steve Blank Secret History of Silicon Valley https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTC_RxWN_xo</p>
<p>Gee I wonder where they got all the technology for EM uranium/plutonium enrichment, phased array radars, semiconductors, lasers, fiber optics(laser &amp; fiber optic were not terms back then) etc etc. </p>
<p>Here are a few interesting observations, including a giant IG farben(now bayer/monsanto) plant pulling massive amounts of power and built with slave labor. https://youtu.be/Kd_sUOvR2vY?t=406 The whole presentation is worth watching. "Dr. Joseph P. Farrell 2009" He goes on to theorize that the Roswell crash was not alien at all, it was a nazi flying machine. Anti-gravity, magnetic/ionic propulsion is not science fiction. I have a huge collection of research on the subject if anyone is interested.</p>
<p>You can find similar "projects" at a lot of the work camps/concentration camps. There was a huge effort to hide a lot of what went on at these camps by the allies. They even bombed the hell out of one of the camps, I can't remember the name/location of the camp but I believe it WAS a nazi military base 6months prior and they claim it was a mistake. Acting on 6month old intel is a pretty big mistake. </p>
<p>reddit won't let me link bit chute and youtube pulls this down whenever it gets uploaded: https://archive.org/details/DavidIrvingManipuationofhistory You can find a lot of his books on archive.org too. </p>
<p>TLDR; Sorry for the mini history link-bomb but knowing some of this is very important considering our current situation.</p>
<p>edit: Should read the rest of that Shockley entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shockley#Political_views</p>
<p>I'm sure everyone here has seen Bill Gates' eugenicist viewpoints. His onstage slip of "reducing the population with vaccines". Also research William Gates Sr. and his mother Mary Maxwell Gates</p>
<p>"Mary Gates played a big part early on in the success of her son Bill and Microsoft. Being on the board of United Way, she met the CEO of IBM, who was eventually introduced to Bill Gates."</p>
<p>Oh yeah, speaking of IBM and Nazi's / Eugenicists. https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/04/hitlers-willing-business-partners/303146/</p>

        <p>I'd like to distinguish between "noncompliance" and "grudging compliance".  I don't see any of the former in my area.  I see lots of the latter.  </p>
<p>All of these articles that demonize noncompliance are attacking a straw-man.  What they are really after is the grudging compliance.  It is extremely problematic for them to have a large numbers of people who have sufficient executive-function/self-restraint to grudgingly wear masks in order to avoid painful social consequences (e.g. fines) but still able to maintain an attitude of protest and objection, especially online.  It makes us harder to label as "sociopaths" if we can comply but still protest the attack on civil liberties.</p>

        <p>it is a strawman indeed. it's the same tactic used against "conspiracy theorists". the point is not that there might exist some kooky people that believe whichever subject of ridicule put forth, the point is the ridicule itself and associating anyone that disagrees with the mainstream narrative with those 'crazy-sounding' groups whether they actually believe such things or not.</p>
<p>whether it's conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers or now, anti-maskers, it's all exactly the same strategy. by labeling people as such, it automatically ensures a large swathe of the popation just doesn't go there. they don't look into it any further and don't want to be associated with any of those 'bad' terms. highly effective.. :(</p>

        <p>Let's call "grudging compliance" what it really is, <strong>cowardice</strong>. </p>
<p>If they are still even <strong>slightly</strong> afraid of getting the fake virus, we can just call it "ignorance" I guess. It's really not hard to figure this thing out, you could figure out it's all fake just by paying attention to the "official numbers".</p>

        <p>Or people with some of those traits are harder to manipulate into following and believing in arbitrary guidelines with appeals to empathy and fear, especially the guidelines that have serious downsides.</p>
<p>I don't know anybody who's complaining about hand-washing, unless you mean scrubbing your hands raw every time you touch an object that you didn't personally disinfect, which isn't recommended anymore anyway. Paying a little extra attention to hand hygiene does almost no harm and washing hands is something people are used to doing already, so few people have a problem with it. But when you're telling people to radically change how, when, and if they socialize for months without a clear end date, and making them muzzle themselves in public which impairs communication, is physically uncomfortable and causes health problems in some situations, and hasn't been proven to make a difference when the wearer isn't sick, then you get pushback. People who are less susceptible to the media's emotional manipulation push back more.</p>

        <p>This is classic gaslighting. Pathologize/ demonize the enemy and accuse them of what you are in fact doing. What is more sociopathic than 'every life matters, even if it costs 10,000 lives to save it'...?</p>
<p>That being said I'm sure there are some people refusing mandates because they're the kind of person who is difficult about everything - you know the kind of person who is rude to waitstaff and clerks just because it gives them a power trip. Not because they're concerned about government overreach or secondary effects.</p>

        <p>So that's why the post was removed within three hours of it being posted. For clearly stating there's no threshold for acceptably 'infringing rights.' Not for accidentally showing the sociopathic mindset of people in this sub 👌</p>

        <p>Do you not understand we are not discussing the same thing? You say "infringing rights," which is not what the removed comic referred to. So why are you trying to discuss the comic? </p>
<p>The state "infringes rights." 
The individual "surrenders rights."</p>
<p>It isn't necessarily wrong to surrender any of your rights; you likely do so in small ways every day. But it is always wrong to infringe your rights.</p>
