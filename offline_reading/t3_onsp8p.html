    <p><p>Remember brothers and sisters to keep your interior house in order. Have your arguments as razor-sharp as you can get them, make their foundations unassailable. Be able to articulate the other side's arguments to such a degree that they would agree with your summary before speaking your own point of view. Take time away from the bad air of the marketplace, this toxic sludge which is seeping in through almost everything now, and get back to nature. Love yourself and your loved ones, and try to love those who hate us!</p></p>

        <p>Speaking of <em>resistance</em></p>
<p>Today I worked out at the park with a resistance band kit. Was pretty good, could hook it in to anything I wanted, a fence, a post, a park bench and get a decent , low-risk-of-injury work out, and without having to pack weights around.</p>
<p>Would recommend to anyone who wants to get out and workout at the same time.</p>
<p>For some reason the city parks around here keep their gates locked.. Parks not officially closed but for some reason locked the gates to fields and stuff..</p>
