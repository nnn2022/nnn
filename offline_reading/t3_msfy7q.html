    <strong>Why do people trust the medical world so much?</strong>
    <p><p>There are some good doctors and nurses, and obviously some medication works, and kept some of us alive, but why are people blindly trusting of the medical world? Are these people mostly who haven't been sick?
The real medical world is a maze of contradictory opinions, misdiagnosis--some of my diagnoses I had to fight for, and do my own research, some quacks--this one doctor wanted to do experimental stuff with me, and it was insane, profit driven, ableist, racist, sexist [in some venues while others are better] and most are linear thinkers. They don't look at things very holistically. Some old school doctors preached the importance of exercise, clean air, whole foods but once I got shouted down on a message board full of medicos that avoiding GMOS was wrong.</p>
<p>A lot goes wrong with the human body and they are far from figuring it out. The medical world is PRIMITIVE. if Dr. McCoy was real and came back from the StarShip Enterprise, I am sure he will be filled with disgust at the oversights in today's medical world.</p>
<p>The first day I read about mRNA, I thought that sounds messed up and there's at least 20 venues of failure or disaster that could arise. Take it from a disabled person, the medical world is far from perfect and has serious serious problems. So watching everyone march in blind obedience and trust to it, is creeping me out. :/</p></p>

        <p>I don't know why your post was deleted, maybe because of the submission declaration, you will have to put it back and comment this time, just below. I could then try to show you my point of view on modern medicine and on the hypocritical doctors of 2021</p>
