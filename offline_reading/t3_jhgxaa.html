    <strong>[Rant/Confession] I'm peace with dying of COVID19 (but don't believe it will happen)</strong>
    <p><p>I'm a young and healthy college student, so I don't think I would get severely sick or die. But if I died of COVID19, like some people believes are possible, I'm peace with it. I would much rather die of it than strict lockdowns and restrictions, no entertainment, socializing or fun. I wants to live, not just exist. I'm not suicidal at all and don't want to die, but I don't think we should fear death too much either. We should especially not fear it more than wrongdoing in life.</p>
<p>I don't want a new normal and I don't want a permanent new normal, or the mass fear. Now I know COVID19 isn't as dangerous and deadly as first thought. Yes, it may have a different names than the flu. Yet it has a high survival rate.</p>
<p>I don't believe in blaming or shaming someone for not following restrictions saying it's their fault if someone gets severely sick or dies. It's the virus' fault, not people's fault. It's not helping anyone blaming either. There have been many diseases and disasters earlier without the blaming. I've never said blaming games have never happen. Example when the leprosy hit in the biblical time and such. But there have been times it didn't happen too.</p>
<p>I also admit I would rather get executed than following unfair laws in dictatorships too. If I lived in some of these dictatorships that require you to dress X, do Y and so on, I think it would take a toll on me too. But even more and more severely. Democracy, dictatorship or what - some laws I would always be disagree on.</p></p>

        <p>You sound like a smart, well-balanced human :) </p>
<p>We have an unhealthy fear of danger in our society, and an equally crippling desire for safety; both fear and desire for safety are useful and important, but only when the cost/benefit analysis works out correctly ... that is what has gone tragically wrong here with our response to covid. We have let fear run rampant and prioritized mere safety over life - while implementing policies that cause tremendous harm and are <em>anything</em> but safe. </p>
<p>You could absolutely get covid and die. The odds are on par with your winning the mega millions or getting struck by lightning on a sunny day, but it could totally happen. It’s just that those odds literally aren’t worth even thinking about.</p>

        <p>Yes, everything can happen. Car accidents, cancer, plane accidents, food poisoning and so on. I believe we're only living once and that we should try to enjoy life as much as possible.</p>
<p>I've noticed many of the pro lockdown people also are afraid of car accidents and many other things. It's natural to fear death, but in my opinion it's not worth it being afraid of absolutely everything or being for the lockdown. I've noticed some pro-lockdown people are willingly to eat junk food, smoke, drive without seatbelts and so on, but are pushing for lockdown and masks in fear of COVID19. Honestly, no humans are flawless or without contradictions.</p>

        <p>That's mature thinking. I personally believe its evolved into a less lethal strain anyway. I could die of an embolism in 15 minutes, who knows, right? But we have to live life anyway, with purpose. I really feel so badly for kids/ teens/20 somethings right now. It should be fun and free and social, not this dystopia crap.</p>

        <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I'm also strictly disagree with the blaming game. If you do X and Y, it's your fault if your dear neighbor gets severely sick, permanently disabled or dies - by their logic. I think it's the virus fault, not people.</p>
<p>I also know who would be blamed by neighbor Johnson if they gets the rona. Me. (Fictional name for pro lockdown archetype)</p>

        <p>I hear speeches all the time from pro lockdown people everywhere how my decisions are bad and I may kill them or disable them. Off course I don't want to kill or disable someone, something I know they knows too. I just don't think it's my fault and doesn't fall for the guilt trap. I genuinely think it's the virus fault and not mine.</p>
<p>If they gets severely sick and die, something I don't believe is very likely, it may have happen anyway. Maybe through their jobs or when they goes out. It's easy putting the finger on me. I don't blame them though. If you weren't fed 24/7 with horror stories, you wouldn't be as afraid.</p>
<p>I would be devastated if something bad happened to people. Off course I would. I'm just not agree with the narrative that's common nowadays.</p>

        <p>I'm a 24 year old man.  That means my annual risk of death is 0.16%.  Maybe it's a little less than that for me because I don't have a terminal diagnosis or engage in a lot of risky behavior.  That sounds like nothing, but it's actually orders of magnitude higher than my chance of dying of covid-19 even contingent on me getting it.</p>
<p>Let's say that my annual risk of death is 0.2% this year because of a small uptick due to covid-19.  That's the same as my risk of dying when I'm 33 anyway.  You don't see 33 year olds cowering in fear to try to eliminate a miniscule chance they will die, do you?</p>

        <p>I don't think I will die and the likelihood is low. Pro lockdown people knows that. But when people bring this up, this is my answer when they're not accepting the low risk argument.</p>

I'm just not thinking it's worth sacrificing all fun just to exist. I'm peace with taking risks like how I'm peace using cars although car accidents happens. None lives forever.
