    <strong>Skiing is becoming a hassle because of the COVID guidelines</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, it's my first post on this subreddit, I did a few comments but mostly read the comments of the doomers who are raging on there. Here's a little rant: Yesterday, we were going to ski in the morning. We planned it the day before, my dad tried to buy the tickets online, but the option wasn't there until the next week. The day that we went skiing, we didn't ski because there is a limited number of people that can ski per day due to the rules, that was why online tickets weren't available, but we didn't know. You only can have 1/3 of the full capacity because the resort was in a red zone. The worst thing is that we are outside and the transmission level is negligible. We went to another ski resort a few kilometers away. My dad talked to one of the staff at the ski resort and said the limited capacity rule was stupid and the employee agreed. I'm glad that still a few people have a bit of common sense and haven't been brainwashed by the lamestream media. Because of the fact that we couldn't ski in the two ski resorts, we left and went back home and thought we would be able to ski only once this year. My dad also went in a rant in the car and we talked about how limiting resources is a part of starting communism and that the lockdown is how our governments enforce communism and I agree with that. Our governments are starting to make fun things lame because of that. Eventually, it's going to get worse.</p>
<p>Skiing in Quebec has become a hassle, don't let your governments do whatever they want.</p>
<p>Last time I went skiing was in early January and it was a shitty experience. We didn't wear a mask, we were wearing a neck warmer to protect ourselves from the cold and most of the time, it was below our nose and every time we were noticed with it below the nose in the chairlift area, we were harassed by the staff to put the face covering on our nose. Fuck you, I'm outside and went skiing to breathe some fresh air! It was badly managed and counterproductive, it was insulting how much they were virtue signaling about wearing masks and social distancing and then closing one of the chairlifts, which in turn made a long line of people and then we quit when it happened.</p>
<p>I will explain to you guys the rules in ski resorts in <a href="https://images.radio-canada.ca/q_auto,w_960/v1/ici-info/16x9/carte-zones-quebec-province.png">red zones</a> (high-risk zones of COVID contraction which 94% of Quebecers live in):  The shelter is open only for the washroom, rental, and take-out. Masks/face coverings are mandated inside the shelter and lifts for prople aged 3 and older. Here's an article about it:  <a href="https://www.sommets.com/en/ski-resorts/winter-sanitary-mesures/">https://www.sommets.com/en/ski-resorts/winter-sanitary-mesures/</a></p>
<p>Let's hope that in the future, our lives will go back to normal, but I don't think it will any time soon. Go outside, visit your family and have fun refusing the new normal!</p></p>
