    <strong>Perspective From A High Schooler</strong>
    <p><p>I go to high school in a semi-rural, suburb of a suburb of a suburb type area in Minnesota. Aside from about 6 weeks, my school was fully in person last year, albeit with mandatory masks. 90% of the school (roughly 1,200 students total) barely complied with this, masks were off in classrooms where certain teachers didn’t enforce it and they were always below the nose/on chin. But, there was no widespread resistance to it and kids would wear them correctly if told to.</p>
<p>But now the atmosphere is different. It’s only summer, and my school has yet to comment officially on what their mask policy will be for next year, but as soon as there were mutterings across social media about whether they would be bringing them back next year, EVERY KID I’VE TALKED TO is 100% against it and is saying that they will absolutely refuse to wear one. And this isn’t just the school hicks (who frankly barely did last year), this is everyone from the popular kids to the “druggie” crowd to your average high schooler. Vaccinated or unvaccinated, everyone is against it. We are fucking <strong>DONE</strong> with it. My friend group and I have agreed to refuse to wear one. If the school decides to require them, I am planning on contacting everyone I can from school admin to the school board. I will get as many people as I can on board to just refuse to wear them. Because I am fucking done. I WILL NOT go back to that bullshit.</p>
<p>That turned into a rant, but I’m dead serious about refusing to wear one. And so are tons of other kids. Take it for what it’s worth, this is a school in a primarily conservative area, not like it’s San Francisco or something, but I just figured this sub might appreciate knowing what I’m seeing.</p></p>

        <p>Good for you.  I'm telling my high school kids to resist, and even if corrected, to employ passive-aggressive compliance.  By that I mean that if a teacher tells them to put the mask on, they momentarily comply, only for it to slip below their noses, or down to their chins, or hang from one ear.  I have assured them that there will be zero fucks given for any notes from teachers, suspensions, etc.  </p>
<p>Eventually the teachers and administrators will get tired of the safety theater and object.  At least I hope.</p>

        <p>Good on you! I wish my parents were like that. My mom is a MAJOR pro-mask, pro-lockdowner (elementary teacher, coincidentally). I’m taking a risk in standing up for this as I’m being pressured by her to take the vaccine as well. I was told that I would “face consequences” if I continued to not comply before MN’s mandate was lifted. I’m sure any punishment from school would be doubled at home but this is truly my hill to die on.</p>
<p>And I really do hope that our side can find allies in leadership positions like that, it would certainly help</p>

        <p>About 375 kids under 18 have died from covid since this started. Out of about 75 million kids in the US.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, about 200 kids die every year on bicycles, and 800 drown.</p>
<p>Getting the shot and wearing a mask as a kid makes about as much sense as  walking around all day with a bike helmet and life vest on.</p>
<p>I shouldn't give these  lunatics any more ideas though.</p>

        <p>I even doubt the number of 375. I am not sure whether this is a German thing or a world wide thing but here everyone was/is counted as a Corona dead who was also positively tested. No one cared about correlation vs causation. And don't forget that any CT value above 40 (in connection with the PCR test) has the tendency to cause wrong positives!</p>

        <p>Yes. This is what I’m hoping for (assuming a mask mandate is implemented). That right there is national news. An entire high school saying “fuck your mask”? May change some minds. Far fetched, but one can dream.</p>

        <p>Fantastic to hear. I was (and am, really) the same way, largely a rule follower, until masks and lockdowns came along. For whatever reason they just don’t sit right.

<p>I'm at this point too.  I'm generally a rule follower, and have been grudgingly putting on the mask where required, but I think I'm finally turning into a resister.</p>

        <p>Me too. My line in the sand was the vaccine as I refuse to get that. But before about January of this year I would wear the mask. It was only around that time I started to refuse. Everyone has a different breaking point, glad to see another person refusing!</p>

        <p>Meanwhile at my university everyone wants to go back to on campus classes at any point... (we had online teaching for 1 and a half year and never saw any classroom from inside) most of them said they don't mind wearing masks anymore.</p>

        <p>Im also a highschooler and last year I was probably the only one without masks and it doesnt look like that is going to change really not because everyones scared of the coof but because nobody wants confrontation from teachers, granted I entered a school that is...well...progressive, pray for my sanity. But even so every one I've talked to isn't taking the clotshot and while I don't really give a shit who takes it who doesn't I will at least try to save my closest friends from it. Stay strong friend, I have high hopes we will prevail in all this.</p>

        <p>Good idea. My school made the news a few years back for having a <em>pro</em> gun walk out in the midst of all the anti gun ones (there was an anti gun one at the same time). So it’s not unprecedented here.</p>
