        <p>Just yesterday I argued with someone here who told me that military would never support masks or mandatory vaccines, they'd be on our side... Clearly.</p>

        <p>I just got out of the Army. Everybody I know still in is loving it because they are getting paid while doing nothing. Military is very socialist you get paid whether you do nothing or work super hard. No difference. So for them this is a massive vacation. Some units are still training somewhat but even that has been cut back 50% or more if not entirely. So basically they just sit around on base now(stateside not overseas in danger) and get paid. All supporting masks and lockdowns.</p>
<p>This is what showed me that's is all about whether or not someone's paycheck is effected by who supports it. Keep in mind the military is LARGELY conservative especially the Army and the Marines. It's not about left or right it's about whether or not you've lost your source of income what side you are on.</p>
<p>There are people who have a lot of empathy who may still have their income but still disagree with the lockdowns. These people exist but they are very rare. Largely from what I've seen over and over from different groups and especially from a mostly conservative group in the military who mostly voted for Trump is that the as long as someone's income isn't effected they don't really care. Sad but I guess that's human nature. Politicians know it and exploited it.</p>

        <p>I work for the federal government. I know their employees are largely liberal, but I see the same things here. People are getting paid regardless. I work an essential job so I've been going to work, but even within my organization, there's so much fluff that could be cut. Lots of the non essential employees have been working from home this entire time, getting paid their full salaries. I can guarantee they aren't doing nearly the same amount of work as if they were in the office. We've suspended training at my job, so the new hires have been on admin leave since March. A lot of them are getting paid $100k a year to sit on their asses at home.</p>
