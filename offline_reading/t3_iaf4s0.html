    <strong>Cataloging N3-friendly businesses?</strong>
    <p><p>I came across a post in the Chicago suburbs subreddit about a coffee shop with a no-masks sign in the window (OP was as salty as you would expect) and now I know of somewhere I can go for a freedom-friendly cup o' joe.</p>
<p>Should we maintain an index of places like that where we can go to show our support for refusing to bow to the hysteria?  I know the prevailing wisdom is "you 'just' need to go to rural areas" but I think it would be helpful to have concrete data with names of places on our side.</p>
<p>Something to think about, either for here or the ruqqus guild.</p></p>

        <p>As much as I'd want to see it on here, it's better off on +LostSkeptics. Any kind of list like that would be inviting the main sub brigade.</p>

        <p>IMO. If it was in a state with mask mandates I'd avoid bringing unwanted attention to them.  </p>
<p>I have a few holdouts but lost one of my favorites recently because they were proudly displaying their don't ask don't tell policy.</p>
<p>So keep it within your known circle.</p>

        <p>I went to a store today to buy some CBD gummies and told the guy how much I hate wearing an itchy mask and he told me I didn't have to wear it. They'll be getting my business often.</p>
