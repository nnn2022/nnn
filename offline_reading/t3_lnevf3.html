    <strong>any veterans here?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey US military veterans.</p>
<p>do you recall boot camp, then they shaved your head and took all of your personal property to make you compliant?</p>
<p>strip the individual.</p>
<p>remember holding the person "responsible" that caused you to get extra pushups or extra duty.</p>
<p>well, that's what this masking bullshit is feeling like and the shaming of those that don't "play along".</p>
<p>the media shaming entire state governments for not being strict enough.</p>
<p>constant propaganda everywhere you look.</p></p>

        <p>generally speaking mate, I think they are more susceptible if anything due to military conditioning, I've had loads of conversations with the lads where they have talked about discipline.... which I have tried to break it down a bit; into compliance under corrupt politicians and vested interests in civvi street isn't the same as following orders from the chain of command to maintain combat effectiveness in a unit.</p>
<p>Then I get called a tin foil hat wearer etc...</p>
<p>There's a few that seem to see what's going on, but in my experience they are the minority.</p>

        <p>I am a US vet, and I deployed alongside UK troops. I love you guys over there, but I have to admit that your culture is way more compliant and trusting of government. Every one of my vet friends is disgusted by all this, and within reason we all exercise non-compliance. My favorite method is to not wear a mask, and when challenged pretend I’m deaf and use gibberish sign language.</p>

        <p>US army veteran here. No not even comparable. This is my take. In the army we volunteered to work together as a team to "complete the mission". That's putting the mission as the number one priority above said individuality. So the Drill Sargent would assign tasks to be completed by a team (mostly) and that was our team goal not individual goals. Take bed making... Everyone needs to be up shaven dressed with a well made bed and out in formation by a set time. If Bob fucks up His bed we all got smoked not because they wanted to brainwash us. In war if one man fails to cover the "left flank"then the enemy could penetrate that weakness and kill us all. This is a lesson in the military, if someone fails everyone could end up paying the ultimate price. So those who excel need to pick up the slack.           </p>
<p>Now it may seem like I'm splitting hairs, just hang in there, but politicians took emergency powers for themselves and declared a priority that we did not all agree on. It's as if Bob did actually made his bed correctly but lock us down anyway, then said something has to happen out of our control/influence for them to relieve themselves of these powers and stop the lockdown. I'm not disagreeing about propaganda being used but the politicians are just blatantly lieing to us. This isn't boot camp... This is how tyranny begins</p>

        <p>Yes I’ve thought about it before, anyone who has been through boot camp should be able to see right through it, otherwise you’re blind. Bootcamp was exactly the same thing, tear everything down to build everyone’s thought process up differently. I also think compliance depends on the age of the vet, these younger ones are so weak.</p>

        <p>Yep, the fun thing about 'collective punishments' is it gets the group to do the 'extra-legal' punishments to each other. Anyone else remember blanket parties? When I was in, DIs couldn't just beat the fuck out of the platoon goofball. We weren't supposed to either, but it happened... No one knew how.</p>

        <p>I also remember tons and tons of shots. One day we had to walk through a gauntlet of shots on both sides of our arms. Some people became ill. They gave us the anthrax vaccine, but you could opt out of that. The others you couldn't. All modern societies preach that the individual is sacred, but where is that the practice?</p>
