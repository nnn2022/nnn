    <strong>"New Normal" Is More Than Just COVID.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sure I'm preaching to the converted here but I feel it needs to be said. It seems that due to the overwhelming pressure from our NPC friends that we are focusing too much on COVID - as in the virus itself.</p>
<p>Mask mandates to lesser degree and vaccinations to a significant degree, are both important but we need to carry on pointing the finger at the real issues here and not get backed into a corner where we're constantly defending ourselves. Whether the virus is real or not, or whether it's the worst viral infection since ebola or an overblown cold is irrelevant. </p>
<p>If you're young and healthy there is an overwhelming chance you will be completely fine. The societal, economic and dare I say psychological and spiritual ramifications for going along with all the other trappings that come with the "new normal" are not quite so easily weighed up and we need to be helping the public come to terms with that reality. </p>
<p>Mr Gate's ID2020 rollout off the back of COVID is just the start. We're talking digital currencies, possible resource allocation based off Internet history, monumental job losses due to a looming corporate collectivisation scheme. The risks to ours and our childrens futures is a damn sight more important than the average mentally crippled spasmodic shouting about masks because they want a beer down the pub.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, if these psychopaths and their useful idiots win then there is a risk we'll all be living a life where we wish we <em>had</em> died of fucking covid, this is before the potential long term effects of vaccine injury have surfaced. Honestly, I love you all for taking the time to think critically but time is quickly diminishing and the mods here should really be trying to limit the trolls and guide constructive discussion.</p></p>

        <p>I don't even know at this point. In a way, if the vaccine did kill everyone and they left the rest of us alone I'm struggling to see how the elite didn't have a point. The level of intelligence is so low these days.</p>

        <p>"If you're young and healthy there is an overwhelming chance you will be completely fine"</p>
<p>This is true, and I don't know why you're couching that like it's some kind of controversial statement. The CDC website actually says as much. Your odds of surviving Covid are about 99.95% if you're under 45 and don't have any underlying conditions.</p>
<p>What I haven't been able to grasp is why it's so difficult to understand that most people aren't young and healthy.  Ie, jist because your own demographic is practically immune from the worst outcomes of Covid, why does it upset you so much that people in other demographics take it seriously? If you're in your sixties or older and have say high blood pressure and obesity (and lets face it, that's probably thirty million Americans) then the odds change dramatically.</p>

        <p>You said a lot, and I don't know how much of that can really be talked over in a format like this, so I just touched on what jumped out at me as being my own biggest question mark.</p>
<p>I didn't know this sub existed until today, and I'm just trying to get a rough idea of what the general consensus is.</p>
<p>If I'm understanding the argument you laid out in your most recent comment, you're basically saying that anyone who is sixty or older has already lived their life, so it's unfair to ask people to wear masks and social distance, because that's subtracting from younger people's enjoyment of life, while older people are more or less dead already so what's the point.</p>
<p>My own personal reaction to that would be to say that losing a year of normalcy is actually a bigger sacrifice for older people than it is for younger people. It's one thing to miss a year of in-person high school, you've still got the whole rest of your life. But it's a different matter when you've only got maybe five or ten years remaining of your natural life expectancy, and suddenly you can't visit your kids or your grandkids for a year. That year might constitute a tenth or a fifth of the rest of your entire life.</p>
<p>But in a more general sense, I don't think you have a winner of an argument. People who are 30 or younger and don't have any underlying conditions are only a relatively small (and relatively poor) segment of the population, so why would you expect broad policy issues to favor you specifically? Like hey, we only represent about twenty percent of adults and about ten percent of the total economy, but is it ok if we dictate the terms for public policy in ways that put most people at greater risk, so that we can enjoy our lives a bit more?</p>
<p>That's just an obvious loser of an argument, politically speaking.</p>
<p>I do think the impact on the economy and people's long term career prospects is going to be massive and probably isn't taken as seriously as it should be. But to me, things like AI and offshoring are going to fuck your generation orders of magnitude harder than Covid restrictions ever will, but people here seem more worried about masks and social distancing than they are of being automated into a permanent McJob kind of existence... Which blows my mind. If I were 25 and healthy, I'd be way more afraid of automation than I would be of the idea of a couple of years of masks and six foot seperations.</p>

        <p>You're still misunderstanding the wider point. The lockdowns and mask wearing is a side issue, a mild inconvenience. Personally I dont actually care about wearing mask, although it is ridiculous in that it clearly makes bugger all difference. My concern is that globally we are all submitting to the edicts of the few and essentially giving consent to this small technocratic elite when we do so. </p>
<p>When our political elite are openly talking about using this crisis to push other issues like automation, UBI and social credit systems, it should be generating way more concern for the future than it is. I mean the fact that social media, Reddit especially, "nudges" (see nudge theory for reference) it's users towards certain points of view and usually heavily censors the sorts of things im saying here doesn't help, but our leaders are bizarrely forthcoming with their plans, we're just not allowed to talk about it in a negative light.</p>
<p>If putting myself at a bit more risk (given that I'm mid-thirties) gives my children more of a chance of living a free life, then so be it. I honestly don't want to live in the world that our delightful leaders seem intent on creating anyway. There are worse results than death.</p>

        <p>It feels like you're conflating a lot of things that were already gaining momentum before Covid, and sort of sloppily mashing them all together into one big thing.</p>
<p>AI and automation (and offshoring) have been reshaping society for quite some time. </p>
<p>I'd really be curious to understand why you'd object to UBI in the long run. If you're 35, it's probable that by the time your kids are middle aged, AI-driven bots and drones will be able to do about two thirds of the jobs in the world. If we don't have some form of UBI, most people will just be unemployed and broke, living in the basement of whatever friends or relatives they know who are doctors or lawyers or one of the few remaining occupations that still require human labor. </p>
<p>That world is coming for all of us sooner or later. It's pointless to try to fight it, as far as I can tell. The only things left to fight for are related to whether the future will be a life of leisure on UBI where you spend your days doing whatever, or a dystopian nightmare where six rich people basically rule the world while the rest of us battle for crums in the streets.</p>

        <p>I'm not clumsily mashing different issues together. See this is the issue. It is impossible for me and the others who share my viewpoint to get you to see what we see unless you willingly take the time to start connecting the dots.</p>
<p>They World Economic Forum are calling COVID "The Great Reset": https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20May%2015,greater%20urgency%20during%20the%20pandemic.</p>
<p>But whilst you may be forgiven for thinking the WEF holds no authority, you also have to know that the United Nation's gave the WEF defacto authority over its business and SDG work, something which many protested about actually because it basically sold out the UN to joint corporate and Chinese interests. </p>
<p>It also just so happens that a few months before this all kicked off in 2020, there was that big UN sustainability summit where they said "2020 will mark the decade of accelerated action". Then you have the WEF and UN connections with the WHO, the fact that Bill Gates was working with the WEF and declared 2010 the "decade of vaccines" which they then decided to use as a means of getting everyone on earth tagged with a digital ID.</p>
<p>I know it sounds ridiculous, but sometimes reality is like that, and those of us who've spent the last year actually reading this information are the ones who are called lunatics when we're actually just reading official sources and not some shit on MSM.</p>

        <p>This is a conspiracy theory, but I think it's basically just a misinterpreted version of a bigger, but less interesting loose conspiracy.</p>
<p>The WEF is real. The neoliberal conspiracy to continue the trends of corporate dominance is a real thing. </p>
<p>None of it is directly related to Covid though, except to say that Covid sort of sped things along and probably hastened the processes that were long in motion.</p>
<p>The whole thing about Gates and microchips is a lot of nonsense. They had to chip certain people in third world countries because those people don't have IDs and medical records are scant or non existent in those places. </p>
<p>People sort of took these stories about microchips and mashed them together with these ancient Mark of the Beast legends that have been circulating for over a thousand years among Christians. You can literally find examples of people in the year 1666 saying things superficially very similar to what you're saying, and see 1 plus 666 is the year "they" finally institute the Mark, all that nonsense.</p>
<p>What Bill Gates is really fighting for is a very particular brand of medicine that's hierarchal and intellectual property based, as opposed to what the WHO actually wanted, which was open sourced, collective medicine that isn't profit based. So if you want to recruit allies in the battle vs Bill Gates, let's all right for open sourced science and medicine, and not intellectual property and corporate medicine. But when you start talking about microchips and this nonsense, it whips evangelicals into a frenzy but it makes you sound like a tinfoil hat wearer to anyone with a decent education.</p>
<p>I'm just as scared of what these big neoliberal corporations want to do to human civilization as you are.</p>
<p>I just think the answer is the exact opposite of what you probably imagine. What we need is a more stateless, less powerful federal and state (or provincial) government, with stronger labor rights, strong workers unions, a robust social safety net with single payer healthcare and eventually UBI for people who are permanently innovated out of the work force.</p>
<p>I'm fine with the 20s being the decade of vaccines. But lets make it open sourced, local labs using the research from the rich countries to benefit local populations, not big stupid corporations sending out humanitarian aid packages to the third world.</p>
<p>Vaccines are a good thing, and MRNA vaccines are an exciting new development that has the potential to transform medicine as we know it. When you go around spreading this nonsense about side effects, blowing commonly understood rare side effects completely out of a rational proportion, you aren't helping anyone except the exact people who are pushing the agenda you're opposed to.</p>
<p>What we need is less government authority, more socialist policies, and higher taxes for these billionaires. And honestly we need to outlaw corporations, because that's the poison that really drives most of this narrative.</p>
<p>But the biggest thing you really need to understand is that wearing a god damn mask and standing six feet away from people isn't oppression, unless your understanding of freedom is at a 7 year old's level. All freedoms and liberties come with a set of responsibilities, and when those responsibilities aren't met, the freedoms are revoked. That's how it's always been in any nominally free democracy with written laws.</p>
<p>The restrictions with Covid are often annoying, often silly, and not always the best plan in hindsight. But the overall theme of the restrictions are aimed at trying to prevent needless death - not to get you primed and ready for the Antichrist or the Bill Gates mark of the beast.</p>
<p>That's all my long winded way of saying that I don't think we have a terribly different world view. We looked at a lot of the same events and news trends, and we both see a trend we don't like. So I don't see the listening gap you see, I just connected the dots together to tell what I feel is a more rational, more fact-based story.</p>
<p>I don't expect to be able to change your mind or anyone else's, but I'd at least like to attempt to get you to understand that when you ally yourself with these mark of the beast conspiracies, you're in league with the pizzagate crowd and the global cabal of pedophiles who are secretly in control of the world etc. It puts you in a fringe lunatic group that <strong>no one will ever take seriously</strong>, even though I think the neoliberal agenda you're trying to fight against is a real agenda that does exist and is very dangerous. </p>
<p>Your natural allies are Marxists, anarchists, and socialists. </p>
<p>Those are the natural enemies of neoliberals like Clinton, Bush, Obama and Biden. Their natural allies are fascists.</p>
<p>This whole sub and the whole ideology you're representing here is unwittingly doing a lot of legwork for the neoliberal fascist corporatists who won't be happy until we're all owned by corporations.</p>
