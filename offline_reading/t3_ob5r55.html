    <strong>Lex Fridman Podcast with Bret Weinstein</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone watched/heard the podcast, or parts of it? </p>
<p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TG6BuSjwP4o</p>
<p>Generally I think Weinstein is a beacon of light in this dark time of censorship and suppression of healthy scientific debate.</p>
<p>But what do you guys think of some of his statements like (paraphrased):</p>
<p>"Covid can become an endemic twice as deadly as a the flu because we didn't take proper precautions in the last 5 months."</p>
<p>Essentially, Weinstein thinks that if we took proper approaches (with Ivermectin and other treatments), we could have fully eradicated covid. I personally think that approach should have been taken in the first few WEEKS of the "pandemic" for it to be effective. </p>
<p>So wholly I really like Weinstein and think he is helping wake up a lot of people. But at the same time I am confused why he is not acknowledging that covid will likely not be some supervirus that returns severy year, considering viruses become less potent as they mutate... </p>
<p>One of the parts that I liked though, with time stamp:</p>
<p>2:03:00 <strong>"What society puts children in danger to protect the very elderly?"</strong></p></p>

        <p>&rt;"Covid can become an endemic twice as deadly as a the flu </p>
<p>That's what I've been expecting from the beginning.</p>
<p>&rt;because we didn't take proper precautions in the last 5 months."</p>
<p>I don't buy the idea that we could have actually prevented this. Nothing was going to be effective enough to prevent this extremely contagious illness from becoming endemic. Luckily, it's not that bad.</p>

        <p>How is it "extremely contagious"? I know multiple cases of families where one person got it and had symptoms/tested positive, while their family members in the same house did not have symptoms and were negative. </p>
<p>A bunch of people on this sub have not been wearing masks or social distancing the entire time and never got sick, even from close contact with people who had covid. Also, regular flu and colds somehow disappeared this year? I think this is all a bunch of bs.</p>

        <p>&rt;How is it "extremely contagious"?</p>
<p>It's more contagious than the flu. Maybe extremely is too much.</p>
<p>&rt;A bunch of people on this sub have not been wearing masks or social distancing the entire time and never got sick, even from close contact with people who had covid.</p>
<p>I'm one of them, except that I have no idea if I had close contact with anyone who had covid because no one I know bothered getting tested.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, regular flu and colds somehow disappeared this year?</p>
<p>It's not unheard of for strains of the flu to disappear when a more virulent one appears. That may be what's happening here, but in this case it's competition from another respiratory disease.</p>

        <p>I listened to that podcast and while they make several good points, I completely disagree with him that we can eradicate covid. I don’t know why the hell he thinks that. Pretty ludicrous.</p>
<p>That’s frankly the kind of thinking that got us into this mess in the first place.</p>
