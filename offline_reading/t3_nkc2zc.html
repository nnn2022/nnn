    <p><p>I think I’m coming down with a head cold today or some kind of allergies. Since lock down began, my sneezing has increased more than usual I’ll get like sneezing fits but today I’m all stuffed up. It could be the weather change with allergies or Covid idk but has anyone else noticed since they have gone out less that they have either developed allergies or their allergies have worsened?</p></p>

        <p>Good God a head cold?! We need to shut the country down. We need to demand lockdowns until we develop a highly experimental injection that lessens the symptoms of head colds. It won't prevent them, of course. But, it's still absolutely necessary. I vow to never leave my house again until zero 95 year olds die from any cause ever again. Will anyone else join me?</p>

<p>Please eat an orange or some strawberries and go stand outside for half an hour, weather permitting (take vitamin D if the weather is inclement). You will probably feel a lot better.</p>

<p>For the allergies, try taking a look at <a href="https://learningherbs.com/remedies-recipes/allergy-relief/">this article</a>, and perhaps make yourself a tea using some of the herbs mentioned.</p>

<p>I mean you kind of answered your own question there. When people come here with doubts, make sure we don’t send them running back into the arms of doomers just because we’re jaded and tired of the situation. We have to remember that we’re all susceptible to misinformation and propaganda, and learn to help others free themselves from it. Apologies if you were being sarcastic, it’s hard to tell without the benefit of facial expression and vocal tonality.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but they’ve probably been hit from family and friends as well as media propaganda planting these seeds of fear into their heads. I like that you’re asking them, it will hopefully lead them to an internal curiosity as to “how did I come to think this way?”. I just want to make sure we realize that not all of these people are crazy or dumb, most are just misguided and just trying not to make waves.

Honestly, funny enough, I usually find that going out and being active makes me feel better and less blah, in pretty much any scenario when I'm feeling sickly (unless it's a bad one).</p>

I definitely feel that my allergies have worsened this year, and I've been out working and doing normal stuff despite lockdowns. I have been trying new types of allergy medicines (taking claritin instead of zyrtec) in case my body just got used to zyrtec. I also have been taking emergen-c to get some extra nutrients just in case. Try that and see if it helps? Sometimes really bad allergies feel like you're getting a cold... good luck</p>

        <p>I'm not sure about the genetic part but it part of does make sense. The symptoms you describe sound like a normal head cold though. Stay warm to help "sweat it out" and get some extra vitamin C and vitamin D to help your immune system fight. What always helps me when I have a cold is, drink one of those 1L bottles or however much it is of Sunny-D you can get at Dollar Tree, layering up, lots of naps in between drinking the SD and water and getting some sun if weather permits. Knocks my cold down to two or three days tops</p>
