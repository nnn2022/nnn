    <strong>Hey pro-lockdown folk, how about we make a deal and put all this behind us? I'm sure we can work something out!</strong>
    <p><p>Lets make a deal my pro-lockdown critics...</p>
<p>How about all of you finish injecting yourselves and the small percentage of us "other folk" who made up our minds and said NO can be integrated back into society, after all you've saved the world for everyone with your wonderful vaccines haven't you? You absolute superheroes, pat yourselves on the back.</p>
<p>I mean we've solved the problem at this point haven't we? You guys lined up twice in long lines at your local "pop up" vaccine hot-spot clinics in some parking lot behind a Wendys/Strip Club and got your "shots" a while ago. Why are we still talking about the pandemic? You guys sacrificed for our sins right? You're protected and we've chosen to take our own risks right? Your kids are all getting inoculated this Fall, so you'll never have to worry again about people like us.</p>
<p>What if we collectively chose to never speak of Covid again, how about we memory hole the past 18+ months of this rollercoaster and swear to pretend none of it ever happened. The remaining few of us who refused the shots clearly aren't worth the trouble of businesses having to mandate against us when most of you gracious folk have already stepped up to the plate and ended this. Really, I am humbled by your sacrifices.</p>
<p>Lets get back to Normal! You folks can have your donuts, and the best part is you also get to be normal for the first time in over 18+ months. You lot finally get to build human empathy when you take your first steps outside your dimly lit homes into the Sunlight come the Fall.</p>
<p>Deal?</p></p>

        <p>I would be miffed but I’d be able to move on if the governments all said “you know what? We were wrong. We will all hand over our jobs to more capable people or dissolve the positions entirely. Let’s forget any of this ever happened.” That’s the least they could do. I know it won’t happen, but man it’s a nice fantasy.</p>
