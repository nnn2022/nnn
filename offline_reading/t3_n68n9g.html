    <strong>I’m young and I’m tired of ”remote” learning</strong>
    <p><p>First of all, I’m not trying to get political, although it might seem like it. But when I read articles about how remote school and work is ”here to stay”, after the pandemic, I can’t help but get upset. What is the point of living if we don’t get to go outside, meet people and see new things? We aren’t meant to stay at home all the time. It’s worrying to see how lazy people (Including myself!) have become during this pandemic. And to see how many adults are writing stuff like ”Wonderful, no more commute!” Well okay Karen, maybe commuting can be boring at times, but how are people who don’t have any friends supposed to socialize? How are people stuck in abusive households supposed to get ”a break” from their spouses? It honestly breaks my heart to think that I have wasted 3 years of my life studying a theoretical programme at high school (that’s how we do in Sweden) just to be able to study something that’d lead me to a  nice workplace, when Instead I could have studied a practical programme which would have given me a job where I get to go outside. </p>
<p>I’m sorry if this text was messy but so much things that me and my classmates have looked forward to have been taken away from us... I understand that we need to take precautions but jesus christ why does the world have to change completely?</p></p>

        <p>I remember at the beginning of this, everyone saying "well, what's the difference between in classroom and online learning?  It's basically the same thing?"</p>
<p>Sigh...</p>
<p>This entire year has been a litany of false narratives proven breathtakingly false, but nobody owning up for them.  It's simply mind-numbing.</p>

        <p>im bothered how complacent I’ve become. Last march, me, my brother, and my mom would literally drive around aimlessly just to kill time. we were bored out of our fucking minds. Nothing to do, nowhere to go. </p>
<p>now i look back and think “how different are things now?” i don’t remember what it feels like to be bored. i’ve adapted to doing nothing but sit next to a fucking laptop all day while i waste time. then i spend all night doing make-up homework because I lost every drop of motivation in me. </p>

        <p>Remote school has clear drawbacks and should never be the default. In person education has important benefits for children including socialization, as well as the fact it’s a lot harder to cover up child abuse if the kid physically has to go to school.</p>

        <p>Depending on where you live this may  or may not work, and it may not be a full solution: my friends son was upset he had to go to school 2 out of 5 days and he wrote letter after letter to the principal asking to go to school the full week (except Wednesday when they disinfected the whole school) they eventually caved and allowed him to come back full time.</p>

        <p>Online learning has totally changed me. It’s my first year of high school. I have always done well in school, but now I am failing almost every class because I just can’t pay attention. The assignments are easy, but getting myself to do it is so hard. I’ve had to take so many tests for depression, ADHD, anxiety, and I even had to take an IQ test, which made me question if I’m even worth it. I can’t deal with the stress of it anymore, being told I’m stupid and a killer for not wanting to wear a mask or get the vaccine. Because I have a different opinion. I have to go to a partial hospitalization in a few weeks for my mental health. All because of the lockdowns on a virus that majority of people aren’t severely affected by. I just want to go back to normal.</p>

        <p>I have had to do many remote classes in the past year for UNI and it was not fun. Half the time professors do not try. More classes are allowed in person in the fall but masks are still being forced on us as well as security theater. I see so many people my age living in fear, at times im the only one outside without a mask on. Yes outside people wear masks. I used to be great at classes, but lost some motivation to do anything online.</p>
