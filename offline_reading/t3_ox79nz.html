    <strong>Before you blame everything on the unvaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>I used to believe exactly what I was told and followed the rules the best I could because no one knew what was going to happen. But after a year I started to become more situationally aware of what’s going on around me and I just couldn’t take being treated like a dumb scared child anymore. In my opinion it seems logic and common sense have completely gone out the window and everyone is reacting based on manufactured fear and programmed emotional responses.</p>
<p>For example the anger and despise towards unvaccinated people is a programmed response. At this point the absolute last place our anger should be directed towards is our fellow Americans, yet it is. Divide and conquer. Remember this whole thing started with 2 weeks to flatten the curve and now 18 months later here we are with a society more divided than ever, a mental health crisis, the wealthy getting wealthier and more and more people going into extreme poverty, it’s happening worldwide. The unvaccinated/naturally immune people did not cause this pandemic nor did we lie about almost every aspect of it, but yet we are the problem? —Unfortunately the unvaccinated don’t decide when the pandemic is over, the corrupt government does, and the goalposts will never stop moving. They haven’t stopped lying since the beginning, but all of a sudden now they would keep their word?—Big tech and big government have teamed up to divide the American people. This has the potential to be a perpetually catastrophic cycle that can only get worse and worse. That is where we should focus our energy and anger towards. </p>
<p>We were told the vaccine was the way out of the pandemic but that was an outright lie. We were told we wouldn’t have to wear masks after vaccination, etc. At this point the the public’s response to the misguided and mixed messages coming from our government officials is no different that someone being in an abusive relationship and defending the abuser. People have literally been programmed to blame everything on the unvaccinated but we aren’t the ones who’s lying to the public since day one. It’s a classic scapegoat technique.This pandemic is the greatest event to ever happen to the elite class and the these power hungry politicians. This isn’t a conspiracy anymore when you realize who has been massively benefiting from all of this. The media literally has the ability to keep this pandemic going indefinitely at this point(variants, vaccines, waning immunity, trumpers, etc)</p>
<p>For some reason one stranger dying from covid is absolutely unacceptable to the masses, yet the proven catastrophic economic damage caused from lockdowns and the mental anguish caused by flip flopping mandates is totally justified ( record high suicides, overdose, domestic abuse, child abuse) Roughly 250,000 Americans die each year from malpractice, as of this moment more Americans are dying daily from malpractice than from covid, where is the outrage? All of this misery over a virus that is still proven to have a 99% chance of survival. That’s literally the only proven thing about this virus that “the science” hasn’t changed. Is it really even about controlling a pandemic anymore in America or is it about controlling/ dividing Americans? What do you think?</p></p>

        <p>Masks were a divider. The election drama was a huge divider. Now this. Its so obvious strings are being tugged. Problem is most seem to actually want the conflict</p>

        <p>You also have to be aware of where the messaging comes from. Billionaires have owned the media since the creation of printed press. The Rockefeller’s were the first to purchase multiple newspapers and since then the consolidation of media has worsened. Just google “who owns the news”. Big surprise it’s fucking rich people who want nothing but to influence policy that increases their wealth. Question every fucking thing. Don’t let these people fool you into believing they gaf about anything besides themselves.</p>

        <p>Blaming the unvaccinated is dumb. The unvaccinated are not the ones putting mandates in place. I have no simile to put here, but it's so backwards it's beginning to make my brain swell.</p>
