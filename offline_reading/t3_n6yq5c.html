    <strong>Informed consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID-19 vaccines worsening clinical disease</strong>

<p>Most jarring part:</p>
<p>"COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may  sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were  not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been  approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these  vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed  empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified  or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising  antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and  irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via  antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)."</p></p>

        <p>If you hear anyone say that we would have seen ADE by now this is not necessarily true:</p>
<p><strong>Nature Journal:</strong></p>
<p>“Before allowing use of a COVID-19 vaccine in humans, regulators should evaluate safety with a range of virus strains and in more than one animal model.”</p>
<p>“Work with the SARS virus shows that worrying immune responses were seen in ferrets and monkeys, but not in mice. Also, some viral protein fragments can elicit more potent or less risky immune responses than others, and it makes sense to learn this in animal studies before trying them in people.”</p>

<p><strong>Nature Journal:</strong></p>
<p>"At present, there are no known clinical findings, immunological assays or biomarkers that can differentiate any severe viral infection from immune-enhanced disease, whether by measuring antibodies, T cells or intrinsic host responses."</p>
<p>"Animal models for the evaluation of human polyclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) should be judged with caution because FcRs that are engaged by IgGs are species-specific as is complement activation. Antibodies can have very different properties in animals that are not predictive of those in the human host, because the effector functions of antibodies are altered by species-specific interactions between the antibody and immune cells. In addition, the pathogenesis of a model virus strain in animals does not fully reflect human infection because most viruses are highly species-specific. These differences may falsely support either protective or immunopathological effects of vaccines and antibodies."</p>
