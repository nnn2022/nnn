    <strong>“Listen to the scientists” is not the end of the discussion</strong>
    <p><p>“Listen to the generals” is the only way we can win this war, right? Your opinions about the war are irrelevant, just listen to the generals, admirals, and commanders. They say that they want more time, more money, more supplies, and that we need to draft more troops.</p>
<p>But what about all of our casualties? What about civilian casualties? What about all of the time and money that we’re wasting on this war? Doesn’t matter, just listen to the generals. They care more about winning the war, so you should too.</p>
<p>This is how I feel about “listen to the scientists” regarding our response to the coronavirus pandemic. First of all, whenever someone says “listen to the scientists” they’re only talking about the ones who give the most dire predictions and advocate for the most stringent measures.</p>
<p>And like the generals who only care about winning the war, many public health experts only care about stopping the coronavirus. They’re not considering the economic devastation of lockdowns, the loss of our civil liberties, the impact of closing schools on our education system, the shocking increases of depression and suicide, the upending of careers and relationships, the upcoming epidemic of homelessness, or the many other consequences of shutting down society.</p>
<p>Of course I’m not saying that we should ignore the experts, but we shouldn’t shut down any discussion or disagreement by saying “listen to the scientists”. It’s a statement of blind faith.</p>
<p>We live in a democratic republic, not a technocracy. The truth is, even science can be political in situations like this. When people were protesting coronavirus lockdowns we were told that this was unacceptable, but when much larger protests swept the nation for a different reason we were then told that was worth the risk. Yes, maybe it was worth the risk, and that’s a decision we can make, not a decision to be made for us.</p></p>

        <p>I noticed there is a rise of fake intellectualism amongst my friends lately. It started around the time TED talks were a thing. Suddenly everyone started watching TED talks because it's "what smart people watch". Then they all watched Interstellar and talked about how amazing and thoughtful that movie is, and if you didn't like the movie, that's because you are stupid and didn't understand it (Emperor's New Clothes). Same with scientists now. In last few years, every single claim online always gets the same reply "do you have a source for that?". Now, it is important to critically view facts and crossreference data, but just because a scientist says something doesn't make it automatically correct.</p>

        <p>Sometimes it's important to defer to experts because you can't match their expertise in their chosen field. But an expert has an incredibly narrow field of knowledge by virtue of being an expert. In the case of coronavirus and lockdowns the experts being listened to are not thinking beyond their small area of knowledge. Epidemiologists won't venture a thought on the physical or mental health damage done by Draconian laws and policies because they aren't experts on those subjects and don't care about them.</p>
<p>Remember the old adage about having a hammer? Well if all you know about is physical spread, don't know about pharmaceutical measures and don't care about ethics and freedoms than your advice will be tailored that way.</p>
<p>Another analogy: you have an unknown group that needs dealing with, ask a general they will say shoot them, ask a diplomat and they will say talk to them, and ask a coward and they will say run from them.</p>

        <p>A large number of the people saying "listen to the science" have never been anywhere near a university STEM department. These are not some infallible gods bringing divine wisdom to earth. They are human beings, many of them incompetent or malicious. We should not listen to some mentally ill person having a temper tantrum on the TV just because they are a "scientist".</p>
