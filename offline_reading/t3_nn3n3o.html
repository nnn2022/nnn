        <p>If I worked for a place that kicked me to the curb in the name of safety, then offered me my job back at the same pay and more restrictions, I'd tell them to pound sand. Get rid of the performative crap and we'll talk.</p>
<p>I'm glad that hasn't been the case for me but it has for a lot of folks around here. We've had very low unemployment for the past few years and now we have a labor shortage. It doesn't help that due to the nature of our city, a lot of people are able to work from home.</p>

        <p>What's sad is there are businesses that think this way. They don't understand that these people aren't coming back. It's been 15 months and people have Bills and mouths to feed. They didn't just sit at home and wait it out like you did. </p>
<p>We have this "problem" a the casino I work for too. They are trying to call back these people after 15 months and it baffles them when these people say no because they moved on.</p>

        <p>“Florida May Lose Some of Its Boomer Shine” [Bloomberg]. “From an economic developer’s point of view, making a big bet on retirement communities 20 years ago made a lot of sense. The Baby Boomer generation was set to be the largest and wealthiest generation of retirees in human history. There are well-worn migration patterns from north to south filled with ways for retirees to spend their investment portfolios, pensions and Social Security incomes. Just as the technology industry found benefits from clustering in San Francisco, and the media industry from clustering in New York and Los Angeles, so the “retirement industry” concentrated in the warm and sunny states of Florida and Arizona. But retirement communities, by definition, are full of people who aren’t working anymore, and so depend on the labor of others. They require construction workers to build homes, healthcare workers to take care of an older population, landscapers to maintain subdivisions and golf courses, and restaurant and other types of service workers to operate the amenities that make their communities desirable places to live. There’s been no reason to think in the last couple of decades that we’d have a shortage of those types of workers, thanks to the loose labor markets following the recessions in 2001 and 2008, and to ample amounts of immigration in the 1990’s and 2000’s. Today it’s a different story. And that’s a problem for communities that have bet their futures on importing retirees. When we think about fast-growing metro areas in the U.S., we might picture Austin, Texas, or Boise, Idaho, which have been popular destinations for people leaving the West Coast in search of cheaper housing. But the two fastest-growing metro areas in the 2010’s were actually Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and the Villages — both places favored by retirees. The question now is how they’re going to sustain their growth in an era where labor isn’t so cheap, and where retirees aren’t necessarily the groups of people best-positioned to win bidding wars for service workers.”
