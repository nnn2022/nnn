        <p>While this is funny, I can't help but feel like this is one of those sick owns you tell yourself you're gonna say but never end up saying. If you genuinely lack the empathy to recognize the often psychological roots of obesity that result in weight gain (via eating too many calories), then I think responding in your manner makes sense.</p>
<p>If you can recognize the person you're speaking to as a person, perhaps misguided by the narrative fed to them, and you have the empathy mentioned previously and still make your comment, then I think you're probably not the greatest person. </p>
<p>Like I said, hilarious but hurtful.</p>
<p>Note: no, i'm not obese, no i'm not pro lockdown, no i'm not pro mask, no i'm not pro everyone getting vaccinated, I just think separating the individual from the ideological spell they're under is far more important than a hilarious zinger.</p>

        <p>I've only been asked about masks a couple times since this whole thing started, and that's probably in part due to the fact that I try to gauge whether a business <em>really</em> expects you to wear a mask before I decide to wear one or not, since it is private property. I think this is what most people around here are doing since people in my region tend to really value both respect but also privacy and I have pretty consistent values with that.</p>
<p>And the couple times I've been asked about a mask so far, I've smiled and nodded then ignored them. No witty zingers or anything.</p>
<p>Additionally, my girlfriend is overweight and I'm definitely not blind to the emotional causes of that.</p>
<p>However, just about all bad human behavior in the universe has psychological or emotional causes. Understanding that is part of being realistic, but so is understanding that it can't be used as a free pass to be an asshole to others, like getting in their face about whether they're wearing a mask or not. "Emotional roots" is used as a cop out way too often, and if applied consistently then <em>everyone</em> is doing the things they're doing because it's what they feel is right due to biases and experiences and things they didn't choose, so we lose the ability to criticize any behavior at all.</p>
<p>Just because an obese person is eating because of their emotions, if they confront someone else about masks first then they are opening themselves up to whatever reply that person thinks is fitting.</p>

<p>As it should be done in my opinion, awesome!</p>

<p>You're absolutely correct, although it's important to note that the poster did not mention anything about a fat person saying "i am obese, <em>therefore</em> you ought to wear a mask". Their obesity is merely one of their 'identities' (hate that word, but it fits here), but it's not the basis for them wanting you to wear a mask. Retorting with, what in laymans terms is, "lol ur fat so u clearly don't care about ur health anyway so idc" when the person just happens to be fat and is asking you to wear a mask is incredibly juveline. </p>
<p>&rt;Just because an obese person is eating because of their emotions, if they confront someone else about masks first then they are opening themselves up to whatever reply that person thinks is fitting.</p>
<p>I think you are misunderstand what I mean by "psychological roots"- i'm not referring to emotional eating per se, but instead the more fundamental belief systems and thought patterns that lead to destructive actions characteristic of obesity or eating disorders. I don't believe we would look at an anorexic person who asks us to wear a mask and say "you obviously don‚Äôt care about your health, so why should I", and I don't believe them suffering from anorexia precludes them from caring about their health in other aspects (masks*). Now if they said "BECAUSE I have anorexia, YOU need to wear a mask", then it's a different story. Similarly if an obese person says "BECAUSE I am obese, I will now yell at you about wearing a mask for MY safety", it is entirely different than a person who has the characteristic of being obese who asks you or tells you to "wear a mask" (notice in the latter their identity as an obese or anorexic person was not their basis for the request). Hope that made sense, it's cool if we disagree but I want to make sure you understand the distinction. </p>
<p>As for psychological roots, what I mean is that the thoughts in peoples heads who suffer from obesity, anorexia, or other typically externally-obvious disorders can be quite destructive, and I think that using that identity as a cheap target for scoring zingers will only plunge the person further into these destructive thought patterns. Great for scoring points on the internet, not so great if we actually cared about the other person. </p>
<p>*It's a perceived health benefit to them, although the efficacy of masks or the morality of masks can be debated for ages. the concept here is that to them, under their ideological view, masks are good and ought to be used, so they are parroting what is told to them, which is that masks are good and keep the people safe.</p>

        <p>No, I definitely say it. I have no problem telling a person they‚Äôre fat I used to be fat myself. Fat is not healthy no matter how you spin it. If a fat person is that concerned with their health to the point where they‚Äôre going to yell at me for no mask, then they shouldn‚Äôt be overweight.</p>

        <p>I used to be fat myself too... doesn't support your argument one bit. Correct fat is not healthy. Incorrect that it's okay to dehumanize others. I think there's a deeper more fruitful conversation to be had here, but either you lack the capacity to understand the nuance of the argument presented, or you're too plagued by your ideological views that you don't care for the argument presented :)</p>

        <p>The psychologism is bullshit.</p>
<p>People have wildly different gut bacteria, and there is fairly good research suggesting this is what causes obesity. Are some neurotic people thin because they are obsessive about food? Sure.</p>
<p>But there are people who just eat whatever, as they desire, don't get fat. Do they eat a whole sheet cake? Not often, but lots of them eat a whole pizza.</p>
<p>I am studying Vitamin K right now, and one thing that obese people have is low circulating K levels, because adipose tissue sequesters fat soluble vitamins.</p>
<p>So, fasting can work, but the premise is that by fasting your body burns adipose tissue full of vitamin K and you can often feel better because your body is getting sufficient K.</p>
<p>But if you don't eat enough K, or produce enough in your gut bacteria, fasting won't really work that well. I mean, fasting has all sorts of benefits, but ultimately, there is something, in my view not entirely genetic, about why some guys can eat pizza, lift weights, be healthy and some guys (actually there is evidence obese people in some cases consume FEWER calories, they just have shit metabolisms) eat a pizza and it goes "straight to their hips."</p>
<p>IMO the real culprit is going to be antibiotics and lack of propre socialization and sharing of gut flora---COVID is only going to make this worse.</p>

<p>People do have wildly different gut bacteria, but there <em>is not</em> 'fairly good research' suggesting gut bacteria causes obesity. If there is, feel free to post. </p>
<p>Vitamin K is great, i've been taking 5k IU vit D3 with 125 mcg Vitamin K2 MK7 and feel amazing. Your notion that somehow a lack of vitamin K drives weight gain (assuming you're not referencing some underlying mechanism that increases calories consumption or reduces calorie expenditure) is entirely baseless. All the power to you, I love when people look at their health under a healthy lens of scrutiny, but the fact of the matter is that weight gain or loss is driven by changes in calorie expenditure or intake. Location of fat storage is indeed largely genetic, and the composition of the weight gain/loss is dependent on a multitude of factors (hypertrophic stimulus, food composition, etc etc).</p>

        <p>The answer directly to your question is no; however, I don't believe your question is of particular relevance. I don't believe people are eating and eating and eating due to some craving for an essential nutrient, and in the event that they were and getting that nutrient made them want to eat less and less... guess what? It would reduce their calorie expenditure! In other words, fulfillment of this "essential substance" intake results in a net reduction in caloric intake as cravings have reduced. Still dealing with the fundamental equation where Weight gain = Calories in - Calories out</p>

<p>Just because they're eating doesn't mean they're getting the nutrient.</p>
<p>Also, presume the nutrient they needed were good gut bacteria, or menaquinone in an amount more than what supplements have.</p>

        <p>I've yet to meet someone so intent on referencing the "research" but not linking into it- provide the research. I don't doubt there's research showing good gut bacteria or other substances can increase your absorption of calories, but I highly doubt the research says what you say it does (that this is a very significant amount of calories).</p>

<p>It's endemic nutrient deficiency, that's all it is. Fat people are deficient, so they eat and eat, but, of course, chips and chocolate and ice cream don't contain much nutrition. For most of history you had meat/eggs and vegetables and milk and that was about it.</p>

        <p>Please explain to me how fat people burning fewer calories does NOT follow the Weight gain = Calories in - Calories out equation (hint: calories out includes the burning of calories!). </p>
<p>My previous replies have unfortunately been quick due to being busy, but i'll lay down some more comprehensive science-based evidence for you to digest.</p>
<p>&rt;You are obsessed about calories even tho there is plenty of evidence that fat people burn fewer calories, not just eat more.</p>
<p>Obese people, interestingly, tend to have a higher BMR than their overweight or normal weight counterparts <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/528122/">[1]</a> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29903123/">[2]</a>. This is likely due to the fact that BMR is a BASAL metabolic rate. In other words, a metabolic rate that includes no energy expenditure beyond that which is required to survive, and it would stand to reason that a more massive person will have more tissue to keep alive. This is also borne out in the literature, as linked above.</p>
<p>&rt;It's endemic nutrient deficiency,</p>
<p>Quite a myopic view of nutrition- i'm at least willing to concede that things like gut flora have an effect on a variety of factors that tangentially modify calorie intake or expenditure, but to say fat people are fat because of a nutrient deficiency is legitimately laughable. I'm once again, and for the last time, requesting you cite your studies if you would like to have a serious discourse.</p>

        <p>This is a seminar, not an academic paper, you don't cite research in seminars.</p>
<p>You're doing this little "assistant professor" act, and it's legit silly.</p>
<p>You're also not thinking, you're just regurgitating.</p>
<p>Take two organisms, both deficient in Nutrient X</p>
<p>Organism A will gorge </p>
<p>Organism B will just slow down and die.</p>
<p>Which organism do you think is better adapted?</p>
<p>The problem is that there are only so many hunger signals--people do get cravings, but they have to have had them and recognized what sates them to understand.  Plus lots of people are divorced from their instincts.</p>
<p>I don't think you're understanding the point I am making about gut bacteria, either. Gut bacteria produce useful amounts of menaquinone, B vitamins, etc.  The difference in fecal output of menaquinones ranges from about 0mg to 2mg/day.  Antibiotics lower liver menaquinone levels, and this is almost certainly due to interruption of gut synthesis.</p>
<p>Even if only a small amount of VK is needed per day, let's say the highest quartile of intake, ~175 ug or so, if gut menaquinone is absorbed at a rate of 5%, if you produce 2mg you absorb 100ug a day. If it is 10%, 200ug, etc.  This research goes painfully slow because it is almost impossible to monetize, VK cannot be patented.</p>
<p>We're only now figuring out how important Vitamin K is--eat your veggies is good advice, but the other issue is menaquinone because plant VK is phylloquinone, which is only converted to menaquinone in small amounts.  Given the endemic colonization of the guy with menaquinone producing bacteria, which is only interrupted by antibiotic use, it stands to reason that humans evolved in symbiosis with menaquinone producing bacteria.</p>
<p>If you have even one nutrient off, the whole metabolism will be screwed up.  There are also vitamin K recycling polymorphisms, so some people might need 1.2x, 1.5x etc. VK, we haven't categorized that and we will likely never get to a point of routine genetic screening for these things, we'll just continue to abuse people who are obese and tell them about "calories."</p>
<p>Calorie reduction and use of fatty tissues likely liberates menaquinone and VK that have been stored in fat tissues.</p>
<p>Also, certain menaquinone producing bacteria require heme iron, which explains the success of carnivore/paleo diets high in heme-containing meats. Of course, excess iron is another factor in metabolic dysregulation.</p>
<p>And then there is the thyroid, I mean, if your thyroid doesn't work, you simply will not lose weight. And guess what the thyroid stores? Menaquinone!</p>
<p>Also, for reasons that remain mysterious to me, Vitamin K is basically the hardest vitamin to buy, at least in Canada, in tablet form.  It's not illegal, it's just, like not sold ANYWHERE except in multivitamins.  Sure it is bad for people on warfarin, but that cannot be the reason.</p>

<p>Great- so I see my refutation of your claim that obese people burn less calories than overweight people has not been challenged in the slightest. </p>
<p>I think you make some interesting points, mostly regarding the thyroid. </p>
<p>&rt;And then there is the thyroid, I mean, if your thyroid doesn't work, you simply will not lose weight. And guess what the thyroid stores? Menaquinone!</p>
<p>Do you think we could uh... just use immunoassay methods that we've had since the 60's to directly measure TH and TSH and determine if the thyroid is functioning that way? If your assertion is that menaquinone effects the thyroid function, then measuring TH and TSH directly would be the most effective test to see if your thyroid is working or not, and from there finding a root cause (potentially methoquinone) makes the most sense. And just FYI, a thyroid not working properly, as in the case of hypo/hyper thyroidism is once again, accounted for in the Weight Gain = Calories in - Calories out equation. </p>
<p>&rt;Also, for reasons that remain mysterious to me, Vitamin K is basically the hardest vitamin to buy, at least in Canada, in tablet form.</p>
<p>I get it just fine here in the states, sucks it's not available easily in Canada.</p>

        <p>A single nutrient being off will throw the whole metabolism out of whack.</p>
<p>Also, given that menaquinone is consumed in small amounts, and synthesized from phylloquinone in small amounts, it's clear that it is stored in tissues as they grow, and that periods of starvation will reduce tissue menaquinone concentration, and it will be difficult to bring that back up, unless a surfeit is consumed.</p>
<p>I don't expect to convince you, I am not doing duleing citations, I am talking about what I think to be the case, e.g., if I were really insane and wanted to punish myself, I would go to a PhD and study this, but one crack at graduate school was enough to turn me off of academia.</p>
<p>I suspect it is a contributory factor, especially because obesity comes along with things that we know vitamin k deficiency, e.g. induced by warfarin, causes, like calcification of arteries.  There's no clear indication of why being obese would cause that, but menaquinone deficiency seems to me to be a likely culprit.</p>
<p>I mean, I think we could probably agree that vitamins are not researched in the same way as pharmcaeuticals because there is no profit motivation to selling vitamins.</p>
<p>If I publish a paper that says "humans thrive with 500ug phylloquinone a day," and provide good evidence of this, it means I have done a noble thing, but there is no way for me to profit from it, anyone can read that paper and implement it. If I talk about a novel drug I have patented, on the other hand, it is very different.</p>

        <p>It's awesome you're passionate about the subject, but unfortunately if trying to establish a theoretical framework by which menaquinone effects metabolism is deemed "dueling citations", we're never going to convince one another, and more importantly, will not reach a mutual understanding. </p>

<p>This is largely true, but I implore you to look into Victor Conte's patent on ZMA, a common supplement used by athletes, and how he used a single study (funded by his company) to show ZMA is better than Zinc or Mag by themselves. There is money to made in the fast-growing supplement industry.</p>

<p>That's a patent on ZMA, which is similar to silicon products, you cannot patent silicon, but you can patent a combination, or "choline stabilized silicon."</p>
<p>Also, studies, citations, etc. lots of them are not reproducible and at the end of the day they are good for proving safety, but the experimenter needs to take the material to see what it does, IMO that is a part of proper pharmacology and body chemistry, especially if the issue is nutrition.</p>

        <p>And yet those losing their minds in fear over covid, while clinging to their beloved masks and running to the nearest vaccine clinic- would find a suggestion like this abhorrent. The covid cult wants everyone shut in their homes while awaiting experimental jabs to ‚Äúprotect others‚Äù- but heaven forbid you mention people taking personal health responsibility so society lessens their risk of spread and actually protects themselves. Fast food places were packed the entire year, and I saw many grocery carts filled with junk food as people hunkered down at home for months on end, avoiding sunlight and exercise. But then we who do take personal health responsibility, have to stay masked up and shut in for the good of society- who don‚Äôt really care to improve the health we‚Äôre all supposedly trying to protect for them, as they shovel in McDonalds and free donuts for their proof of toxic jab reward. (This is obviously referring to the majority who just don‚Äôt care about their health, not those with legitimate health conditions that are not treatable by diet/lifestyle change). It‚Äôs not even funny how much cognitive dissonance occurs daily in those claiming to be the scientifically minded ones.</p>

        <p>Oh, I'm sure it's in the works. Remember when they blocked off some of the grocery shelves as non essential... That was the junk food side. Big brother will take care of you even if they have to lock you up to do it.</p>

        <p>Many apartment children rely on playgrounds for exercise. They taped off playgrounds and filled skate parks with sand. In my neighborhood they stationed a cop at the playground, daily, to make sure no one could use it.</p>
<p>They charge us ever-increasing taxes for these park services and then use the money to pay an officer to keep us from using it.</p>
<p>Incredible.</p>

        <p>The radical left doesn't want this though. And as long as they have the reigns none of us are going to be able to have "individual choices and freedoms". That's the thing people don't get. One side legitimately doesn't believe in that concept and you can't reason with them about it.</p>

<p>I don't either, but the fact is that we do. We also pay for the smokers who need cancer treatment, or heart disease mitigation as a result of their smoking, or stroke recovery due to their tobacco consumption. Applies for many things.</p>

        <p>How about just clean up the food and water supply? People trying to eat healthy foods are getting GMO produce that is screwing up their gut bacteria, which play a key role in whether one stores incoming calories as fat or has them available to burn as energy, and they're getting livestock fattened with hormones and fed Skittles instead of grass.</p>

        <p>The nation went from effortlessly slim to normal weight until the mid- to late-1980s (and we had all kinds of white bread, soda, fast food, sugar, fat, desk jobs, and labor-saving devices for decades before then). Within a few years, these formerly slim people ballooned up by the millions, with the weight gain spreading in a virus-like pattern across the country and to many other countries. It was obviously something systemic that caused the night-and-day change.</p>

        <p>I believe there is a pattern to be found, yes, but still it would be just to do excuses. It‚Äôs all about costumes. People are fat today because they ‚Äúwant‚Äù. There is plenty information and methods to be healthy without being a fanatic like vegans or crossfiters.</p>

        <p>People always "wanted." But they used to have healthy appestats that maintained their bodies at a slim to normal weight by adjusting appetite and calorie burning (burning brown fat, raising one's temperature slightly, feeling more energetic).</p>
<p>See the recent mice studies, in which mice on the same exact diet and exercise program can be fat or slim depending on their gut bacteria. GMOs kill certain bacteria to prevent pests. Humans who eat genetically modified produce and hormone-treated meat have their gut bacteria unnaturally altered. For some, this seems to shunt incoming calories into fat storage rather than making them available to burn for energy. Thus, the affected person gains weight, and feels tired, and still isn't full. That's a broken appestat, not a moral failing for "wanting."</p>
<p>Even obesity experts, who devote their lives to studying the topic, haven't figured it out. I'm glad you have, though.</p>

        <p>Well, see actually unhealthy people are cheaper for the healthcare system. I know that sounds unintuitive, but the most expensive years in healthcare are the old age ones. Unhealthy people have far fewer, often none of those. Across a population, it is <em>lifetime</em> costs that matters.</p>
<p>Actually doing this would cost money to quarantine people, money to feed them, money to have them out of the employment systems -and then you would end up with increased healthcare costs as they lived much longer.</p>

        <p>I actually lost weight over the last year. I know that isn't the norm.</p>
<p>I attribute it to not having to wake up as early, stuff food in my gullet before dawn/work and being free to exercise as I can't in a freezing cold vault room cubicle.</p>
