    <strong>How do they answer concern?</strong>
    <p><p>The fact that the Covid Vaccine trials are not yet played out into the longer term - is one of the first concerns of those with a cautious approach to the Vaccine. It seems we have no evidence for the safety or danger of the Vaccine in the longer term. I am wondering how it is that Vaccine advocates deal with this? I mean it does seem like a very sensible and a legitimate question that a responsible advocate of the Vaccine should be willing to address. I am aware now - that I have seen no discussion between two sensible doctors or experts who occupy either side of this issue. I see posters showing health workers smiling and saying ''Joe Bloggs the nurse says: I have had the Vaccine and I feel fine. I believe the Vaccine is safe and effective.'' This is shifting the potential for blame onto Joe and he might get lynched by an angry mob of terminally ill Vaccinees - at some point - who knows? The big question is - Where is the sensible and mature debate on this question of - no long term trials thus far? How is this concern addressed officially?</p></p>

        <p>You answered your own question. The official explanation is to repeat "saaaafe and efffeeective" " Joe Bloggs is fine". If you repeat it enough times,  the logic doesn't matter, for the majority of people.</p>
