    <strong>Is covid being used as a way to normalize obesity?</strong>
    <p><p>Think about it. All the messaging behind covid is about how we need to protect the "immunocompromised" while a lot of them are probably immunocompromised in the first place because they are obese. We're essentially being told its ok to be fat just get your covid vaccine and you'll be fine. Rather than try and deal with the obesity problem directly which is the real plague here. The fact that all the fast food restaurants were able to stay open as "essential" business during the lockdowns last year tells you everything you need know really.</p></p>

        <p>Seems like last year when it was becoming clear that covid was a real danger to obese people, the pro-obesity stuff really ramped up. Kind of makes you wonder.</p>

        <p>It's because they don't want you to stop and realize that the reason Covid 19 kills so many is because so many are unhealthy. They think if we ignore some of the facts it doesn't really matter as long as we throw around some feel good words about it like "essential" and "immunocompromised". Then when unhealthy people die from Covid <em>or</em> that belong to either of those feel good word groups, they can be martyrs that the social justice warriors can lord over the currently un-vaccinated. It is sad and awful that people are dying from Covid, but its like should it really be such a shocker that unhealthy people have a harder time fighting illness? I agree with you completely that the logical step should be helping people be healthier.</p>

        <p>Yeah to me the most telling thing about all of this is that obesity was the only reason the survival rate is 99.6% instead of 99.99% and yet they never once during all of their "recommendations" and fauci speeches etc stressed that the most obvious and effective way to not be at "risk" would be to manage one's weight and stay out of the obese category. In fact almost everything they did just encouraged people to be fatter. If they really cared, reducing obesity would have been their main if not only agenda.</p>
