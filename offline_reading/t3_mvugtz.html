        <p>I recently broke a bone and went to a big inner city hospital in Alberta. The whole isolation area was empty, the only other person waiting there was a morbidly obese woman who said her knees hurt. Not joking. I saw some drug addicts restrained on stretchers, but that was about it. This was in the middle of the afternoon on a weekend.</p>
<p>The hospital wait times are actually down from usual. Last time I went to emergency a couple years ago I waited for 4 hours. The hospitals have always been overwhelmed from all of the cost cutting and frivolous use of "free" services.</p>

        <p>Not in Ontario but I work in a big hospital in Montreal and we just closed our Covid unit 2 weeks ago. There are still a handful of covid patients in the regular emergency section (numbers have been fluctuating between 15-20 patients for the past few months), but not enough to justify keeping the entire covid unit open. I kept our work newsletter saying the covid unit was closing, and it makes my blood boil hearing all this "hospitals are overwhelmed!" shit.</p>
<p>Also, my friend is a nurse in the oncology department at this same montreal hospital. She IS overwhelmed. Why? Because they're just now trying to make up for all the appointments that were postponed last year bEcAusE oF cOvId...</p>

        <p>Do you mind if I ask how busy your Covid unit was at its peak?</p>
<p>Why do Covid patients come into the hospital? Probably trouble breathing? Would you care to write a bit about it, share your thoughts?</p>
<p>I can imagine your nurse friend in oncology is busy. I remember my grandma too needed something done or checked, but had it postponed.</p>

        <p>I don't work directly in the Covid-unit, I'm in a different department, but every employee gets updates twice a week by e-mail on the number of covid patients in the hospital. So I cannot comment on the patients themselves.</p>
<p>As a reference for now compared to the peak, I just searched for an older e-mail...On May 14th, 2020 we had 160 covid patients. I would say that was around the peak. As of April 19 2021 (my last update) we have 28 covid patients. </p>
<p>I don't see how 28 covid patients in one of the largest hospitals in quebec constitutes a catastrophe, when we were dealing with 150+ last year....I keep all these e-mail updates as evidence...</p>

        <p>What's your blog, if I may ask? I work in a research department within the hospital so unfortunately I am not allowed to go to areas with patients. My info comes from bi-weekly e-mails/newsletters sent to all hospital staff specifically with covid updates, and speaking to friends in other departments.</p>

        <p>I find the Canada covid subreddit to be hysterical, hypochondriacs that are willing to snitch on one another. I have never been more grateful to be a loud, mouthed American. I am shocked at the willingness of Canadians to give up their rights in the name of Covid. Some of the laws that were passed in Canada would NEVER of been accepted in any State in the U.S. You folks are so beaten down by your government, I don't know what to say.</p>

        <p>That's because American law and Canadian law is different. American law focuses more on individual rights even if it means a greater risk to society as a whole. In Canada it's quite the opposite- If a law is created that infringes on individual rights but is for the greater good of society or protects groups of people then it is constitutionally accepted.  Please also note this is a very generalized statement but one of the main differences in Canadian and American Governments.</p>

        <p>I worked in a hospital last summer and our COVID unit was hardly full.   I think we might have had 20ish active patients in certain weeks, but near the end of the summer it was basically unused. I worked there for a placement though so I haven't seen it since.</p>
<p>My sister works in a hospital in the same region, and to her knowledge they aren't overwhelmed at all.  She works in oncology and they're fairly busy due to all of the delayed treatments last year but nothing insane.  Both of the hospitals we work/worked at are within 1-2 hours of Toronto.</p>
<p>I have friends who work in Toronto hospitals and they say that it's pretty overwhelmed, at least at the major trauma ones like Sunnybrook.  I think the situation is mainly contained to Toronto, hence why no colleagues I've talked to outside of Toronto are complaining of anything being overwhelmed at their respective workplaces.</p>
<p>I don't trust how they count COVID cases or deaths, but our COVID deaths in Ontario are still around 30/day despite our cases sky-rocketing, so this makes me wonder how many of these cases are truly resulting in ICU admissions and deaths.</p>
<p>My guess is that management for a ton of chronic conditions was put aside last year and now people have no choice but to seek emergency care.  We know that just about anyone can get a positive PCR test, so I'm guessing that a lot of these "COVID patients" in hospital are just people that didn't receive care last year and have now progressed to a worse point in their disease.  </p>
<p>Understanding that many patients are likely falsely labelled as COVID-positive doesn't take any risk away from them individually (like they're in ICU for a reason), but I believe it falsely attributes this problem as a COVID-problem and therefore we see extra restrictions and whatnot.  We wouldn't lock down for an influx of heart failure patients, but when those heart failure patients are labelled as COVID-positive, Ford has a reason to lock down.</p>
