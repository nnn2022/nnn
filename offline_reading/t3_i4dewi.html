    <strong>As long as people believe that this is a uniquely dangerous virus, how can we ever go back to normal?</strong>
    <p><p>It seems that the majority of the population, including all those in power, take it as a given that <em>of course</em> we can't go back to normal, that the best we can ever hope for is something "approximating" normality, because <em>obviously</em> this virus makes pre-March normality impossible.</p>
<p>In fact, this is considered so obvious that it's become tacit. It feels as though it's gotten to the point where suggesting that one day we might be able to stop social distancing sounds as absurd as suggesting that one day we might be able to stop washing our hands after using the bathroom. This is just what society is now. How could it ever be otherwise, now that there's <em>the cOrOnAvIrUs</em>?</p>
<p>How can this change? More data won't do it - we have all the data we could ever need to uproot the whole narrative, along with plenty of expert voices who see reason, but it makes no difference. People of all stripes, from Joe Everyman on the street to ivory tower academics and politicians the world over, think this virus really is <em>that</em> deadly. What about the almighty vaccine? Maybe, but already the narrative is changing from "vaccine = salvation" to "vaccine = just one more weapon in the arsenal in the eternal fight against Black Plague 2.0".</p>
<p>Maybe it will all slowly fade with time. Maybe this new understanding of what society is and must now always be isn't yet rooted deeply enough in the collective psyche. Maybe this is untenable, and will ultimately collapse under its own weight. But even then, vestiges of this era could linger in the form of mandatory (or effectively mandatory) vaccinations, a bolstered surveillance state, and a precedent for lockdowns/masks/dystopia that could be invoked during future "pandemics" - even ones as mild as, say, the 2009 swine flu.</p>
<p>What do y'all think? Can this ever truly end, and if so, how?</p></p>

        <p>My observations:</p>
<p>Some people were never scared (myself included) and we’ve gone on to do whatever we can for the sake of normalcy and maintaining our sanity. At the beginning, I had people shocked that I even drove to get coffee at a drive thru. Now, lines are wrapped around places.</p>
<p>At the beginning, anyone at all who could do it was working from home and office parking lots were empty. Now these empty lots are full again and they have been for the duration of my city’s case surge and us being a hotspot. I venture to say anyone who agreed to go back to the office can’t really be too frightened of the world? Those same people are filling parking lots of restaurants after work to get drinks, just like before. They aren’t waiting for someone’s blessing, they aren’t checking in on social media to attract some scared friend’s scorn. They’re just going.</p>
<p>There was a solid group of people not on social media before this. Those numbers are certainly rising. I have a friend in California who I’m going to stay with on a road trip. I really didn’t know where she stood about all this because I hadn’t seen her on social media. She said she just kind of dipped out of social media after seeing all the judgement and realized she didn’t need to give a play by play of her life or her whereabouts anymore. She can’t be the only one.</p>
<p>Humans imitate other humans. Some humans will dig their heels in and commit to being shut in and scared of germs forever. They will never listen to education regarding healthy immune systems or how our body does a lot of the heavy lifting to ward off Covid. They will always be scared. They were probably the anxious types before this anyways.</p>
<p>But a major group of human beings will see other humans go about their lives, see them alive, see them not getting sick and agree that time is up for hiding. People who were scared will see family get sick with this and it will be a nothingburger and they will realize their fear was unfounded. </p>
<p>The more people go back to offices, eat out, see friends and family going to malls and restaurants and backyard barbecues, etc, the more people will just decide that it’s time to get back to life. It won’t happen all at once. It’ll happen just as life kind of happens. People won’t ask for permission, they won’t tell social media anymore because they just don’t want one more person up their ass and they’ll just simply start living again. </p>
<p>Demand for concerts and large events is there and that’s exactly why restrictions in place. They know damn well people aren’t scared enough to not go to a sporting event or a concert right now. That’s why they aren’t putting them on or allowing fans in stands. It’s why they cancelled the Indy 500 audience: because 125,000 people bought tickets to attend.</p>
<p>The fearmongerers have overtaken places like reddit and twitter and the media because they have nothing else to fucking do. The people who have decided that they have other shit to do are no longer entertaining the people whose only life right now consists of chastising people on the internet while they sit home with their sad lives. You know that pic out of a Georgia high school yesterday? That many kids and parents were ok with in person school and crowding hallways like that. They just aren’t online telling people about it. They’re just doing it. </p>
<p>Remember: the doomers ONLY have the internet right now. The people who aren’t afraid are no longer wasting their time on social media seeking any kind of validation. They’re just going, especially after seeing the vitriol spun on social media towards people living their lives. The doomers can ONLY get to people via the internet right now and that’s where only the scared will remain once everyone else has fully had enough.</p>

        <p>Very true. I am one of those who has gotten off social media because of how toxic it all became. For weeks on end I was inundated by lectures about masks and social distancing scolds. And if anyone posted anything about doing something fun there was always someone coming on to shame them. I never used social media for anything other than just sharing fun, mostly positive pictures and things about my life and my family. And I have done many things that I would no longer share including travel, dinners out, seeing friends, etc. My son is at sleep away camp right now, but only a few people even know that!</p>
<p>And I think surveys have been showing that even in places like liberal areas of CA, the majority of parents want their kids back in school.</p>

        <p>Same here. I used to check in and post a lot on social media because it felt like people enjoyed seeing the pics I posted. I liked checking in because it would show up in memories on the apps and it was nice to reminisce on. But ultimately all these digital features are new. In my lifetime, people didn’t even have cell phones. They took pictures, got them developed, put them in albums under their coffee tables and shared the pictures with people who came to their homes.</p>
<p>Why can’t I just get back to that? Obviously the only people that will come to my house now aren’t scared doomers and would enjoy seeing my photo memories. I just won’t post shit online anymore and will leave people guessing. I realized I just don’t owe anyone the knowledge of my every move just because we now have the technology to do so. It’s rather liberating!</p>
<p>I’m taking a 10 day drive up the PCH in October and stopping to stay with various non-doomer friends. I’ll probably post some coastal pics here and there but no one will be privy to almost anything I’m doing and I’m pretty sure it will be one of my most peaceful trips to date!</p>

        <p>I was scared shitless UNTIL this thing ripped through my extended family and all of their friendship networks. It started at wedding, where it seems like everyone but me and my wife got infected. Nine members of my extended family tested positive, and about 9 more had telltale symptoms but never bothered to get tested. Among the friends, a couple dozen ultimately tested positive.</p>
<p>Out of all those people, the only person that I would describe as having gotten "sick" was my big brother, who told me that there were probably 2 days where it was bad enough that he would have called in sick if he had an office job. He's 59 and BMI=33 or so. Virtually everyone else described it as a cold, except for those who were 100% asymptomatic. </p>
<p>Once this becomes sufficiently prevalent in a person's area that they know multiple people who have had it, it gets a lot less scary.</p>

        <p>That’s awesome. When was the wedding? It’s crazy to hear about someone going to a wedding now. Upside down world. </p>
<p>I made a post a while ago. Kind of dark... but if this virus were so bad, we would ALL know at least a few people who died. Social media would be full of memorials.</p>
