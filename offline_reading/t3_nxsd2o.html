        <p>You know what they say about people who are leaders and those who are followers? Most are followers, and they flip to new leaders constantly based on perceived power over them. History has many such cases</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, I feel sad a lot too lately, but I'm trying to pray and put out positive good loving thoughts into the World. I had a "dream" or "message", reminding me that we are Beings of Light, Beings of Infinite Consciousness, and that (much to my surprise) the power of our thoughts and will can literally shape this world. I know it seems we're outnumbered, but in time the ignorant fools will awaken from their MSM-coma-induced slumber. Let's pray for Love, Protection, and Healing for our loved ones, our friends, and our fellow human beings (even the crappy ones too 🙄😑). LOL</p>

<p>I tried to read through more of the comments, but didn't get far before giving up.  I'll go back and try to get through them tomorrow.  Maybe even respond (likely not as eloquently as you did, I'm afraid)</p>

        <p>Thank you so much, I just don't like bullies or meanies, so when I see fellow human beings making fun of or picking on someone who is sincere and just wants to help others then my rage meter goes through the roof. I've given-up somewhat from posting in the Ontario, Canada and other Canadian-related subreddits. Too many are brainwashed. Got to hand it to the ones who orchestrated this. They've planned it out very very well. I suspect they've been planning this for the last 50 or maybe 100 years. It takes time to pull-off something like this, as you have to have all your game pieces set in place, ready to strike.</p>
<p>Sad times ahead.</p>

        <p>Financially pressured to get the vax. What are you talking about. This is why I'm here on this sub. The only people getting a vaccine (according to you) are: immature people (adults or kids?) that (still?) live at home, people that have lower than average IQ, or people that are financially pressured...what kind of worldview is that?</p>
<p>I have a job. I work at a company with thousands of employees. To think the only people, either if they have or haven't gotten a vaccine, are any of the things you listed is just everything I need to know about someone like you. Your mind seems to be made up as soon as you awake every morning. </p>
<p>Permanent heart damage or lung damage from contracting a virus is not an illness. If someone would rather eat at Denny's than prevent that from happening to someone else than that’s THEIR CHOICE.</p>

        <p>Whats absurd is adults having tantrums about being asked to follow the bare minimum requests for preventive measures of an actual life threatening virus. My cousin is 19 and has permanent heart damage from it. He was not in any risk categories. He wasn't an armless person going for a swim. You're pretty much telling me you have a right to invoke a dangerous environment on people like my cousin. And no matter how you justify it for yourself, it makes no sense to me or most people. It comes off very short sighted and selfish actually and more people would agree with that than not. Certainly not here in this echochamber but all is not lost in the pursuit of reasoning.</p>

        <p>That just isn't what is happening and it isn't a good analogy. I'll explain. Basically what this rhetoric boils down to is: "there is a virus but those that are healthy and not immunocomprised will be fine. We shouldn't do anything different despite there being people with higher risk factors. There is nothing we can do for them but wish them the best." That isn't true at all because there are steps people can take to minimize their risk. People choose not to. I'm sure you have similar opinions for people with food allergies.</p>

        <p>I never said we shouldn’t do anything at all. Feel free to distance in public if you want. I’d even distance or wear a mask if I was with someone at risk and they wanted me to do that. My point is that the government shouldn’t be forcing people to distance, shut down their business, mandate masks, etc.</p>

        <p>Ohhhhhh. It's government. Okay well the government has, in the past, fined people for not adhering to the measures dictated to ensure public safety. They didn't do that this time around. If the government isn't providing direction than who should? I just can't imagine anyone that feels this way be put into a room full of high risk individuals and telling them "yeah I could do what I can to minimize your risk but unless you ask me to personally then i won't. Also, the government (which represents the people) shouldn't be able to tell me to do that for you either." I can understand where some people might be coming from in the realm of personal freedoms but the line is crossed once you leave your private property. That's just the way it is.</p>

        <p>They did that here. I live in Canada. At one point here you could get a $1000 fine just for visiting another family member. It was ridiculous. The government could provide direction, and encourage safety measures, but they shouldn’t be forcing restrictions, especially not ones like shutting down business. Everything that was deemed “nonessential” was closed here. So only big stores or malls could operate.</p>
<p>We weren’t even allowed to have gatherings on private property. It was illegal to have anyone outside of your household over in your own house</p>

        <p>I'm not sure how else we can ensure we're stopping the spread of a deadly virus without sacrificing some freedoms. And it was never going to be forever. The lockdowns were never taken seriously in America so I can only speak for what I've seen here.  I'm exhausted by this conversation. I commend you for remaining civil and entertaining discussion and criticism from another viewpoint.</p>

        <p>We don’t need to ensure we stop it. Just give at risk people the resources to stay safe. And that’s fair, these arguments tend to go on forever never really getting anywhere. I don’t think we will agree but I’m hoping we’ve found some better middle ground. I don’t think all precautions are bad, I just think the government went way to far in mandating some of the restrictions it did</p>

        <p>Nothing had to change. That's my point. Those people would've died regardless of the measures taken during this and there's nothing we can do to stop that. That's just how a virus works. It is the absolute height of human arrogance to think that you can.</p>
<p>The fact that the measures taken go against the global mass of scientific evidence and knowledge and just...common fucking sense is a problem behind the fact that it's hurt many many more people than were ever "saved".</p>

        <p>I disagree that those people were going to die anyway. That just isn't true. Not if something can be prevented. I can type it out here what I explained to another user in this comment section. Basically what I mentioned was how my 70 yr old parents were letting my cousin stay with them while he was becoming a firefighter. He caught covid and they took pretty extreme measures to ensure they wouldn't contract it as well. Left meals outside his door, cleaned the bathrooms everyday. They didn't catch covid. My cousin didn't have symptoms. But they couldn't risk it. To say they were <em>supposed</em> to hedge their bets just sounds crazy to me. They had first hand knowledge that another cousin of mine got covid and has permanent heart damage. He's 19. My 70 yr old parents can't roll the dice with that. I mean, unless they wanted to I guess. Sigh.  I understand it should be every individuals right to choose, but they still don't get to choose to contribute to other people's potential risks. Wouldn't you agree? I just told you my family's reasons, but you wouldn't know unless we talked about it. Then I think about every individual inside a grocery store. Where does our right to choose how to handle a pandemic infringe on other people's rights? At a certain point it does. I'm just wondering where that line is.</p>

        <p>You just said it yourself: when it infringes on others rights. There is no guarantee of safety or security or even survival in this world. There never has been. That's why people are free to choose their own measures and protect themselves how they see fit. They do not get to impose on others. The idea that we have some sort of social obligation to give up our personal freedom, etc for the perceived safety of others is entirely artificial and manufactured. </p>

        <p>What can be learned? What is new? Masks were new to me. I adapted. I didnt kick and scream about my false sense of rights to impose onto other individuals. I dont subscribe to the idea that being apprehensive to things that the majority of people agree on is considered to be an advancement in personal growth. It's quite the opposite. My ego will just fine. People need to worry less about egos and more about actual human lives.</p>

        <p>I mean what do we do with unvaccinated people that are blaming vaccinated people for contracting covid? Families are being divided by this. And citing VAERS with an unverifiable death toll just isn't helping anyone. That's why I'm on this forum. VAERS has turned into a hashtag and it's completely dishonest.</p>

        <p>Stay on this forum if you want answers. I am against any and all censorship. So I also know many people who have had Covid and suffered. I’m not saying the virus doesn’t exist! I’m saying it was upgraded to a threat that never existed. All for any other plan. Another agenda. Vaxxed or unvaxxed your choice. When they start targeting young ones is when I get scared. And they have wanted 12+ vaccinated. Trials have started on 5 year+. Very scary guys 😖</p>

        <p>Yeah he couldn't get the vax in time. And he certainly couldn't get his mother to take it seriously in the first place. My parents had another cousin of mine living with them during the lockdown. He needed to change his address in order to become a fire fighter. He eventually contracted covid and my parents would bring him his meals. He was asymptomatic and maybe they were excessive with their caution but they never got covid. My parents are in their 70s and my father has had multiple surgeries. What is the expectation? Should they have just completely ignored all preventative measures in the pursuit of normalcy? The risk so much higher than 2 weeks of setting his meals outside his bedroom door and cleaning the bathrooms daily. Like I said, my 19 yr old cousin has permanent heart damage and they knew this was a possibility. I just dont understand what the goal is here. Basically everyone I know now has been vaccinated and they're fine. For people to rely on the Wikipedia of reporting sites to scare others away from something that by principle just doesn't do what people are saying it does just seems unfair to others that may be hesitant to make a decision.  We can talk forever about vaccines and how effective or ineffective they are. I was given many vaccines as a baby and because of it, I'm going to live longer. That's a fact. And any anti-vaxxers that are out there have been vaccinated. Why this set of vaccines? Why would they want to kill everyone off? Especially the ones that are willing to go along with it? Why would they want a world of apprehensive people? It makes no sense to me.</p>

        <p>I don’t think this is the end game. Suicides, sterilization (in 12 year olds+) what happens when those 12 year olds are 27 and trying to have a baby? No one knows. No one. I won’t be taking that chance. Covid bring it on</p>

        <p>It always goes to "I think" and "I believe." I commend you for discussing this with me and being very respectful. I just have to state that people's beliefs are not fact. There is no link to infertility and that has always been a myth from the anti-vax ideology. Autism just isn't enough to convince people these days. Not like that has anything to do with vaccines in the first place. People become infertile for a number of reasons that can actually be linked to causes. Alcohol is a good example for that. It doesn't seem impossible for people to blame the vaccines when they don't want to admit something like alcohol could have been a contributor. People love alcohol. I'm waiting for the anti-vaxxer that just survived polio to tell me I still shouldn't ever take a vaccine. I'm really interested in what that person has to say but they don't literally don't exist.</p>
