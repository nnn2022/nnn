    <strong>Curfew discussion in Dutch court</strong>
    <p><p>It started on Tuesday morning at the court of The Hague, where the judge, at the request of the Viruswaanzin (Virus Truth) Foundation, examined the request to immediately abolish the curfew.</p>
<p>The judge agreed with the opponents of the corona measures, because the law on which the curfew is based is only intended for very urgent circumstances. The judge used the example of a dike breach. At that time there is no time to consult with the House of Representatives and a measure must be introduced quickly.</p>
<p>The judge finds that the law is not intended for curfew in the current circumstances. There is talk of a pandemic, but the pressure on healthcare is not at its peak and it has been discussed before the introduction of the curfew. In short: the judge ruled that the curfew should be lifted immediately.</p>
<p>The government was taken by surprise by the judge's decision. Prime Minister Mark Rutte called it a "setback". He reiterated that curfew is not an end in itself, but a means. Together with the limitation of home visits to one guest per day and the corona measures that have been in force for some time, the number of infections remains reasonably under control.</p>
<p>According to the government (and the Outbreak Management Team), curfew is still necessary to keep that control. Therefore, the government announced that it would appeal the judge's verdict.</p>
<p>That appeal should only be made on Friday morning and to ensure that the curfew can remain in force on the intervening days, the Dutch State has asked the court to consider this.</p>
<p>The court in The Hague would look at this so-called suspension incident from 4 p.m., but even before it came to the content, the court was challenged by Viruswaanzin.</p>
<p>According to the protest group, the court was not independent and lawyer Jeroen Pols gave several reasons for this. However, a challenge chamber decided that the challenge was unfounded and the hearing continued as usual.</p>
<p>The hearing was over around 8.15 pm and the judge withdrew. He decided at 8.40 p.m. that the curfew would remain in force for the time being, at least until the appeal on Friday. She does not want risk a "jojo effect" with a curfew that may be off the table now, but will be back in the appeal, she indicated.</p></p>

        <p>The chairman knew van Dissel. They worked together in the past. She lets him speak without interruptions, yet she keeps interupting everyone else. </p>
<p>I'm glad this happened though. This 'play' will help us in coming elections to get rid of the corrupt BBB/TGR politicians, if we get fair elections.</p>
