    <strong>My entire world has turned upside down.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m literally as left as it gets. Or at least I was. </p>
<p>I was front and centre for occupy and actually was considered such a “leader” of our local movement that it caused me some legal issues due to civil disobedience etc. </p>
<p>I have a liberal arts degree. My mom was a bra burner and is now a frontline social worker at a hospital. Activism is something I grew up with and believed in my whole life. </p>
<p>I took pride in being an organizer in the anti capitalist movement. To me this meant anti globalist. Anti racist. Anti sexist. Anti what the fuck we are seeing in 2021. </p>
<p>Real, left. Long before this woke neo-liberal insanity. </p>
<p>Now? Now I don’t know what the fuck to think anymore. </p>
<p>I went to a freedom protest and that was a trip. Me, being a hardcore atheist, was surrounded by people totally down the “god rabbit hole”.  I was out of my element for sure, but let’s face it: religious people are on the front lines of fighting for all of our freedoms. Any enemy of my enemy is my friend. </p>
<p>But it was weird. Lemme tell you. I told myself “it is Easter, have an open mind”. </p>
<p>Then “antifa” showed up. My old comrades. Only my comrades had conviction and compassion. </p>
<p>These were NOT my comrades. </p>
<p>And what I saw only further confirmed my decision to defect to “team humanity” (whatever that even is anymore).</p>
<p>So here are  a bunch of white, middle class university types dressed in black holding signs  like “Black Lives Matter” etc. Pounding offensive music and basically there to cause shit and violence. They reminded of the wimp being “held” back from fighting by his buddies, needing the cops to protect them. </p>
<p>Nice sign. White kid with a “stop white terrorism” sign. Clown world in effect:</p>
<p>https://imgur.com/gallery/wfkwftt</p>
<p>These were not people who believed in freedom, but a bunch of masked professional provocateurs taking pictures of their “activism” so they can virtue signal on Facebook (god is there anything less “anarchist” than that?!?).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on our side we had all kinds of people. All colours, kids, old people, disabled people. Homeless people. You name it. </p>
<p>We were told by both the police and the “anarchists” that our torches “ were symbols of hate”, as we were literally standing in the shadow of Calgary’s iconic downtown tower, which, ironically enough, is in the shape of a torch. </p>
<p>Like the Olympic torch. A symbol from the dawn of humanity of light , civilization, togetherness and hope. Pretty sad from a city who’s identity is so entrenched in the 88 olympics they held. </p>
<p>And what were we doing? Peacefully assembling, exercising our charter rights (Calgary Canada here) and literally FEEDING EVERYONE. Our side. Their side. Homeless people. You name it. </p>
<p>https://imgur.com/gallery/dTtZK6V</p>
<p>While we were busy feeding people these provocateurs attacked old people and kids and when we went to help them, another group went and tried to steal the churches audio gear and the rest of our food we were distributing </p>
<p>The behaviour of these “anarchists” is THE COMPLETE FUCKING OPPOSITE of everything I’ve ever stood for. I lost it. </p>
<p>Here is the video of “anti capitalists” literally hiding behind the cops they want to defund. Who’s police station they burnt down in Minneapolis last summer. </p>
<p>This kid was so scared he was literally cowering behind these two cops. Watch for yourself:</p>
<p>https://imgur.com/gallery/FMdCSQ4</p>
<p>Entitled white upper middle class kids who have never felt discrimination, who have never lived under a totalitarian state, coming to a protest for everyone’s (INCLUDING THEIRS!!) freedom, intimidating kids and literally taking food from the homeless. </p>
<p>I snapped. It took two cops to keep me from literally ripping this kid apart. And the kid knew it too. His eyes were all pupil. He was fucking terrified. </p>
<p>Antifa soldier huh? Advocating for the globalists, hiding behind cops, stealing from a church, attacking innocent people, and taking food from the homeless. </p>
<p>All while wearing a mask. They can’t even show their faces while they “protest”. This is the behaviour of cowards. Not hero’s. </p>
<p>We got the church their stuff back. And then I was basically told to leave by these same church  because I was “too extreme” and “my behaviour wasn’t Christian”. </p>
<p>I’m politically marooned. Ethically exhausted. Tired of trying. </p>
<p>Is it that difficult to understand? </p>
<p>If the globalists have their way NO ONE PROTESTS.  There will be no dissent. No free speech. Freedom is extinguished for us all. </p>
<p>Can’t we stop fighting each other long enough to ensure that our freedom to disagree and organize survives? </p>
<p>We can always go back to fighting each other in the future. </p>
<p>But only if we win today.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant/wall of text. Just needed to vent and this sub seems to be one of the last bastions of sanity on the planet. I thank each and everyone of you for being here and supporting each other.</p></p>

        <p>I love that you went out of your way to investigate and learn about the opposing side. This is super important for personal growth. I was raised a super liberal but one day I decided to actually try to listen the opposition with an open mind. Turns out.. I was incredibly brainwashed and just regurgitating what the news and my parents would tell me. I didn’t even know what I was actually fighting for.</p>

        <p>I had the same revelation in the beginning of 2020. I was super liberal too, never bothered to hear from the other side, just like you and OP. Then once I did take the time to listen to the other side and research things for myself, it was eye opening. How brainwashed I realized I was, and how brainwashed so many people are. It's scary.</p>

        <p>That's what the elite don't want. They don't want either side to listen to the other so they brainwash with catchy phrases and words people can easily remember and regurgitate.
Easier to control us when we're so divided and fighting with one another.</p>

        <p>Just gonna add myself to this list too. I’ve come to understand that I was just really naive during my intensely liberal days. My friends were all so passionate about issues like equality and justice and I thought that anyone who didn’t agree with our viewpoints must automatically be anti-equality and anti-justice. </p>
<p>I still hold many ‘liberal ideals’, but find myself inching more and more over the conservative line each day as the illusion of good intentions and idealism fades into the realities of the world we are in.</p>
<p>This has caused me a great deal of heartache and social isolation, but once you see it you cannot unsee it.</p>

        <p>Same same same. Reading this comment thread has been soul food for me. I live in a very liberal city, and the isolation from not having anyone on the same page to talk to has been mentally devastating. Even my rebellious, bad ass friends are falling in line with the status quo as much as the rest. It’s a trip, to say the least.</p>

        <p>Jesus man, I've been conservative for 12 years now but you just reminded me that 12 years ago that barely mattered. I miss when we put up with dissenting opinions. As a conservative I genuinely respect, appreciate and acknowledge the necessity of liberals, its just been such a slog over the last 7 years trying to combat rampant leftism that I forgot what a decent classical liberal sounded like. So refreshing.</p>

        <p>The Bible is good to view it as allegory and archetypes. Mythology has always been  a way of connecting to people. The people who believe it verbatim is where it can be rocky</p>

        <p>Same! This summer I had family members fight me hard on my BLM support. This family happens to be Black, which made it really hard to call them racist. So instead I started trying to prove them wrong with facts. What happened instead was I accidentally proved a great deal of my firmly held beliefs wrong. Ha! All of a sudden, my blinders came off and I haven’t been able to see the world the same since.</p>

        <p>Lmao yes. I’m black and I do not support Black Lives Matter. All the black people I know do not support it either. I really only see young college-aged white people that care about it more than we do at least where I live. It sounds like a good cause until you really look into it.</p>

        <p>Phew! This makes me feel less ridiculous. It’s a weird place to be as white person not supporting BLM. I can’t imagine what a trip it is as a Black person. Do folks think you’ve lost it? My family members of Color, who also live in the south,  have been called all kinds of names. Not for being Black. Because they did and do not support BLM. It was them standing a firm ground, that made me reconsider, and I owe them a shit ton for that.</p>

        <p>Same here. I was raised extremely liberal and went conservative as well. My parents are anti gun, pro-lockdown, TDS, the whole nine yards to this day. Smart people, mom has a master’s degree but they both take the word of the media (namely NYT and WaPo) as gospel. I’m just glad I hung out with different types of people and expanded my views as a teen. Made me realize the same thing as you: I was brainwashed, and just regurgitating what the news and my parents said. Wonder how common that story is. I know a lot of ex-liberal conservatives/libertarians.</p>

        <p>I was a left leaning city dwelling moderate who was horrified when Trump won.  Somewhere shortly after that election, I stopped watching the news because it was the same shit every day.  It really freed up space to form my own opinions about things, and that was probably my first real chance to hear from the other side and learn that there are a lot of rational people with sound reasons for voting like they do.  Then all this shit started, and, well... I am no longer a city dwelling left leaning moderate... I am a mountain dwelling, gun toting, don't tread on me sort of person, which is a version of myself that I never imagined.  I will vote for whoever wants to leave me the hell alone.</p>

        <p>You point out something that is so important and that too many people aren’t doing these days: listening to people with different views. My friend group is mostly progressive with some neo-liberals, but I also have conservative friends and family members. Unlike some of my more extreme friends, I didn’t cut off or dehumanize my conservative connections. I listened to them, heard their side of things. Amazingly (/s), they’re not all racist Nazi TERFs! They’re regular people who care about their friends, family, property, country. We may have different views on how best to go about caring for and protecting those things, but our core values are remarkably similar.</p>

        <p>It really is a mind fuck. All of it. I've always known the diehard religious as wanting to take away freedoms, especially mine as a woman, and force belief in God with threats of hell and being ostracized. I have family like that. And now I see them as allies. And now seeing protests get taken over and sabotaged is absolutely mind blowing. It's such a scary time right now.</p>

        <p>I was anti and an asshole for years. I wanted people to see the hypocrisy and wake up. I'm no longer invested in changing minds and will only occasionally post a somewhat distasteful joke meme so no one forgets. I don't try to change minds about anything anymore, but I'm not quiet either. I want people to know they can talk to me about this stuff. I just don't try to force it. Subtlety.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. I've always been socially liberal to some extent. I voted democrat because it was just the default position I guess. I woke up around 2007 when a friend enlightened me about Ron Paul and libertarianism. I was also at occupy with my libertarian meetup group, but it was to talk to people about libertarian ideas. Occupy shared many of the concerns we had, but we differed in what should be done about it. They wanted bigger government, we obviously thought that was the problem. I will say this though, even hardcore socialists were willing to share ideas and have a civil conversation. That's not the case anymore. Who knows what would happen if I went to an Antifa rally to do this today.  It's very strange that liberals are not very liberal anymore. They used to be the one's that were about "live and let live". Now they think you have to follow their every command or your a "nazi fascist, homophobic, cisgendered, masogyist".  They are unrecognizable from 20 yrs ago. All of the beefs I had with the right wing christian republicans as a teen I'm now seeing with the democrat party.</p>

        <p>Same, your post resonated with me. It's funny because one thing I notice with modern conservatives is they are terrified to make their ideas look bad so they usually behave in public. And if you are within the group and are gay, black, etc. They will welcome you and really roll out the red carpet because they really want to emphasize that everyone is welcome. I myself really appreciate when people who are "supposed to be democrat" break that mold. I hope that the group you protested with accepted you as an atheist. I've definitely gone back and forth from athiests, agnostic, &amp; christian throughout my life.</p>

        <p>Just curious about the appeal of your former way of thinking.  Was there some under current never ask your positions?   Do you think you had wrong information about some of your positions now? </p>
<p>I'm thinking by saying you were/are anti capitalism means what?   You support communism?   Capitalism isn't perfect and the usa isn't pure capitalism, but it's the best system ever to lift people out of poverty.   There are all sorts of regulations limiting what businesses can do and things get better all the time. </p>
<p>I'm just curious about your thinking here and what you goals were?  Like you I try to understand the other ways of thinking.   </p>
<p>my guess is maybe you were so anti anti anti everything you saw the world as a miserable unfair, and unjust place, and get trapped in a vicious circle of thinking that is reinforced by others?  I tend to see the world more positively.  I hate the circumstances that millions find themselves in,  but tearing down the rest of society rather than trying to lift others up seems like moving backwards.</p>

        <p>I’ll be brutally honest here. </p>
<p>As a kid I dealt with sexual abuse and other things kids shouldn’t have to deal with. My parents weren’t around a lot. I didn’t have the support system to put the things I saw and read into any kind of context. </p>
<p>Which led to me being just generally pissed off. At my parents, my abuser, the world. Much of it was typical teenage/young 20s angst. </p>
<p>After university I was a touring musician and played in a band that had a very rage against the machine vibe going on. My band mates, label, fans etc all thought the same. It was an echo chamber that reverberated just as much as the digital ones like Reddit or fb. </p>
<p>And being a musician means being broke. I’ve been on welfare. I’ve gone to the food bank, I’ve had no health care. I’ve been homeless. I’ve had addiction issues. </p>
<p>I was literally in my first year of university on 9/11. Two weeks in. And 9/11 was my red pill. I never even questioned the world before that happened. </p>
<p>This all culminated at occupy. It was the first cause I was willing to take direct action against. I was ready to go to war. </p>
<p>And just like in war, soldiers who are depending on each other for their lives and their freedom, you get super close. Like a family, like the one I thought had been cheated out of as a kid.</p>
<p>So combine youth, a radically shifting world, academia, a need to belong and feel safe with a group: yeah I was just anti anti I guess. </p>
<p>I identified as a communist and I still do to a certain degree. But I believe that between media/academia not providing me the full picture and my own willful ignorance/cognitive dissonance I wasn’t able to see things at the macro level I thought I was. </p>
<p>Great question. And thanks for it. I actual had to stop and think and reflect on some shit I hadn’t considered fully before.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing and really sorry to hear about parts of your past.  Not that this is any sort of help, but I do think we should take care of people who can't take care of themselves.  And I believe if we stopped taking care of people who CAN take care of themselves, and remove all the cheats, the big corporate tax loopholes, the fraud and corruption, people like yourself and millions of others might actually get the help they need.</p>
<p>I really don't see the problems you and I are discussing rooted in communistic thinking, socialism or capitalist ideas.  Because each of those systems are results of humans.  And regardless of which beliefs you hold, the frauds and cheats and corruption will exist in all of them.  It is human nature.  People cheat. Just look at the Soviet Union before the wall came down.  There are plenty of stories on reddit that people have shared about what it was really like behind the iron curtain.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not sure what sort of communistic vision you idealize.  Some see some sort of post scarcity future like Star Trek where you just push a button and the food comes out.  Everyone has everything they need and want.  Other people want revolution, and some people desire violent revolution.  My opinion is if we ever get to post scarcity a la Star Trek, humans won't even call is communism by then.  All of that will have come out of the ambition and technology and innovation and drive to success (also human nature).  The same that has fueled the world for the last 100 years to bring us into the modern age where we can argue about the latest vaccines over our $1,000 smart phones.</p>
<p>I hope you have landed on your feet now and have a plan and path for yourself.  Drop me a line if you ever want to talk.</p>

        <p>I know your feeling.</p>
<p>I'm a catholic cristian here, and I witness much of the same. The church is being robbed of it's own essence and bending their knee to the people who secretly(sometimes openly)want to destroy it, and if I stand up for it I'm also called an extremist, and I'm told that my behavior isn't appropriate. But I know it's BS.</p>
<p>I'm gonna continue throwing hands to defend it, even though it displeases the ones I'm trying to save. It's better to have them mad at me than to have them not exist at all.</p>
<p>Also very glad that you're able to see what's going on, most peopke cannot even when they're looking at it.</p>

        <p>I know you said you were an atheist, and the 'church group' booted you...but, don't discount all Christians by the actions of some.  Some of us love and trust in God's plan for this country/world and we pour through the Bible like never before.  </p>
<p>It says that in the later days, knowledge will increase (and boy has it!).  The last book of the Bible, Revelations (as well as Daniel, Thessalonians, Isaiah, etc.), have never been more relevant than they are today, and accurate as to current world circumstances. </p>
<p>I honestly am not trying to offend you, this is just something to think about, if you have never read them, I strongly encourage you to read them <em>for yourself</em>, not rely on what some other flawed person tells you they say.</p>

        <p>In the blue city where I live, there are blue team people on street corners waving various signs all the time. Without fail, they look mean and miserable. I wonder what compels them to spend time out there because they look like they’d rather be anywhere else. </p>
<p>Just before the last election I was driving through rural areas of Washington state. In one little town, there were people out on the main street with flags and signs and crap... they were all Trump supporters and they looked like they were having a blast! They were smiling and laughing and friendly.  </p>
<p>The contrast was stark. Even if I myself were blue team, I’d still prefer red team neighbors.</p>

        <p>Hey brother, maybe you didn't believe in God, but God still believed in you and your salvation. It's not by coincidence your eyes are starting to open. He wants to save you and give you real meaning in life, which is truth, real life is truth. </p>
<p>Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me. Revelation 3:20</p>
<p>He's knocking at your door brother, if you let Him in your eyes will be opened. Evil exists, you can see it all around you, but the good news is that good also exists, and God is love!</p>

        <p>Religious person here 🙋‍♂️ I'd like to say, I agree with every word of your post. It's also VERY refreshing to see an atheist defending a church (in the physical sense) regardless of your disagreements with their doctrine/beliefs. And I say that as one who hates the church for being a cog in the "globalist" machine.</p>
<p>You seem like a very kind person, with an incredibly level head on your shoulders. I would like to say, I wouldn't want to fight you, now OR in the future.</p>
<p>Freedom is inherently about all of us being able to have different beliefs (religious included), and still be able to get along and be civil with each other. Keep spreading the love you do, homie. </p>
<p>By the way, I resonate with the first part of your post too. I never had any legal problems or anything... but I was absolutely on board with occupy, I campaigned for Obama his first term although I wasn't quite yet old enough to vote for him even. I was decidedly "left" and my social viewpoint has not changed one bit. I caucused for Bernie in 2016, by the way, and after the DNC pulled their insane fraudulent shit with Hillary, I even went and wrote Bernie's name in when it came time to vote. Since then, I have been done with both parties. They are clearly both so corrupt they're beyond repair.</p>

        <p>This is one of the most beautiful posts I have read in a long time.</p>
<p>Thank you.  Thank you for having the courage to keep an open mind in the face of this incredible pressure we're feeling.  Thank you for being honest.</p>
<p>Ten years ago I was a hardcore leftist as well, and I left the Left under very similar circumstances as you.  </p>
<p>In particular, I really agree with you about religion.  I too was an atheist, probably after reading Richard Dawkins.  I held religion in disdain.</p>
<p>I have come to have a great deal of respect for religion.  One of the things which has made me the most proud this entire year has been the churches re-opening.  Good for them.  This was beautiful, watching the <em>church</em> stand up against tyranny, in a civilly disobedient, but peaceful way.  </p>
<p>I'm not even going to lie, it's even made me reconsider my own religious beliefs.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing.  - From Montreal, and in a very similar spot.</p>

        <p>Reading “the god delusion” changed my life. I actually read it twice back to back. </p>
<p>And the I put life down for a week or two and just reevaluated everything. </p>
<p>I’ve never read a book that had such an impact on my world view, my perception of reality and understanding of human history. </p>
<p>I’ve also never had a book radicalize my thought process like that either.  The just complete distain I felt for religion and religious people was, frankly, scary. </p>
<p>I have to be honest I don’t think I’ll ever be changed from a radical Darwinist. I’ve had a very close near death experience and I’ve literally experienced the darkness that comes with death of consciousness. </p>
<p>But anyone who stands up, in the face of tyranny, for their beliefs and their intrinsic basic freedoms has my ultimate respect. </p>
<p>This whole experience, Covid I mean, has made me grow as a person In incalculable ways. It’s been extremely painful and scary. I’ve lost friends and family. I’ve lost almost complete respect or even basic giving a shit about anyone, even some of my family, to a point where I mourn for the person I once was. </p>
<p>But I’m a survivor. We all are. You’d be amazed at what you can endure when your back is against the proverbial wall. </p>
<p>Nice to hear from another Canuck. You guys out east got it rough. </p>
<p>Perhaps we can use this opportunity to grow as a country as well. There is some animosity between our provinces, at least in the MSM, but I think it’s bullshit. </p>
<p>My gf was born in Montreal and it’s one of my favourite places on the plant. The francophone culture is a unique one worthy of protecting. </p>
<p>Be safe homie. We will get though this and better for it.  Believe it.</p>

        <p>I've come to realize Christianity is a mushroom cult that lost its roots. So when you go to a church they are all swaying around hoping for but disconnected from the true meaning. So with that in mind I attend and enjoy. As a once-hardcore atheist it makes sense: mushrooms are the physical key that connects science and religion.</p>

        <p>Great testimonial, OP! I'm glad you've had the common sense to wake up to all the insanity going on with these worldwide lockdowns and how the Doomers are reacting.</p>
<p>Just one matter I want to discuss with OP and all of their fellow Canadians who are on this sub:</p>
<p>So I've been seeing in videos and reading in posts/comments for the past year about Canada's "charter of rights" and how these lockdowns are breaking them. As an American who is not familiar with Canada's history, I've never in my life heard about this charter of rights being invoked so this is the first time I've heard of exactly how you have your laws organized. So to OP or the other Canadians here, I have to ask: did Canadians just remember in the past year that they had a bill of rights of sorts that they could have used all this time to stop other authoritarian measures before? Or is it that they never felt like it mattered until now or were too scared in the past to invoke those rights? These are serious questions because judging on my own experience with the US anytime there's even a slight overreach of government the first argument it always the constitution</p>

        <p>Sorry for the late reply but I wanted to do this the justice it deserves.  It's rare to have a non-Canadian express interest in our political/legal process, particularly an American, so I wanted to take the opportunity to fill you in!  </p>
<p>Canada became a country in 1867.  But we were still a british colony legally.  </p>
<p>It wasn't until 1982 that the Canada Act was given royal ascent and we drafted our "Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/pch/documents/services/download-order-charter-bill/canadian-charter-rights-freedoms-eng.pdf">https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/pch/documents/services/download-order-charter-bill/canadian-charter-rights-freedoms-eng.pdf</a>  </p>
<p>As far as your question about exercising our rights this is what I will say:</p>
<p>Although not a utopia, Canada is an amazing place to live.  We are constantly listed as one of the best places on the planet to live and for good reason.  I've lived in the US and Europe and have extensive family in both places.  I've also done a lot of traveling around the world and Canada is the amongst the best place to live (or was) on the planet for a multitude of reasons.  </p>
<p>But we are also quite passive by nature.  Canadians will fight over who should go first in the line at Tim Hortons.  "No no...you were here first."  "Oh no really....you go, Im in no hurry..." etc.  I guess there are worse things to be known for.  </p>
<p>We have had it so good for so long, Canadians don't how to handle a situation like this. It's frankly unprecedented...and by a fucking long shot.  The biggest social crisis we have dealt with were the FLQ in the early 70's and maybe Louis Real in the 1880's.  We simply don't have a history of heavy social activism or of having our charter rights infringed on because frankly it's such a rarity for Canadians.  Stuff you read about in history class, not see outside your door.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the post and sharing the experience.</p>
<p>I do think honestly at this point all we have to weather the storm of political division and general declinen of society is self love. Now I know that sounds simple and totally useless but the thing is once we get right down to it that's all we really have.</p>
<p>I've had a series of mystical experiences and felt an intense love that has healed me in many ways. I know you have said you are an athiest. The only thing I would say though is that, as humans we can see a tiny sliver of the light spectrum and hear an even smaller range from sound waves. </p>
<p>Their is alot going on around is that we litteraly can't perceive. It can be depressing if all we have is the material world and what is in front of us. But their is more out there if you choose to connect to it. Religious or not the inner being which is an endlessly loving entity can fuel you through these times.</p>
<p>Sending you love now brother.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your words on this. I don’t know how I would define my experiences, but if I were to try to summarize it, I would start my saying that I attempted to become an atheist, after way too many years spent in the oppressive scary version of Christianity. I instead called myself Agnostic. It wasn’t until I had my first kid that I started to pray again feverishly. Not because I was sure there was a God somewhere listening, but because the realization of having zero control over whether this tiny being that I loved more than life itself would make it through this scary life, was more than I could fathom. I needed to believe there was someone with more control in things looking over the situation. So, that was my first BIG moment of leaning on a higher power. But it was when the Universe pulled the metaphorical rug out from underneath me, and the terror from the  groundlessness kicked in, that I firmed up my belief in a higher power of sorts. In my darkest moments in life, it has been a quiet internal whisper that always reminds me to trust myself, even when so much has been broken, and I have no reason to trust anything. Turns out, I am always more capable than it seems, and it’s taken getting shit beat out of me to acknowledge that. </p>
<p>One of my favorite life mantras is from Pema Chodron, a bad ass Buddhist teacher. She says, “Only to the extent that we expose ourselves over and over to annihilation can that which is indestructible in us be found.” Remembering this reminds me of my strength, but I have come to understand that strength inside of me comes from somewhere that far exceeds me and my small self.</p>

        <p>Okay guys, can we PLEASE stop talking of left and right? That's such an outdated way of looking at politics. There's no such thing as left or right. I mean, there is, on the surface, in a smoke and mirrors kinda game. But deep down there's no such thing, because regardless of who's in power, their strings are pulled by the same people. The so-called left are in power when their ideology serves a particular goal, and it's the same with the so-called right. But that designation is irrelevant, because ultimately (you guessed it!) those goals are never in your best interest.</p>

        <p>You're correct, but let's face it. A lot of people self-identify as left or right, so it's still useful language. I mean you just went on about it, immediately after saying not to.</p>
<p>Right was crazy authoritarian 15+ years ago with Drug War.</p>
<p>Now it's the left's turn to go totalitarian and boy have they outdone the right.</p>
<p>But yeah at the end of the day, it's a class war (banker parasites at the top).</p>

        <p>It's not difficult to understand. It's common. People get so involved, become disillusioned... and the common next step is to either give up entirely because you are so disillusioned... or switch to a new perspective - and keep being involved with passion.</p>
<p>Good luck making that choice. It's a hard one.</p>

        <p>I feel you !!! I was always what I considered to be a ‘lefty’ in a very liberal town. Last summer I was called every name in the book, cancelled publically, threatened, etc by my community. I thought, if they’re calling me these things and I’m not these things, how many other people are being mislabeled. That’s when I started doing my research and had a massive awakening.</p>

        <p>Classic divide and conquer strategy working to perfection again. In 2008-09 occupy protested the banks. The tea party protested bank bailouts. How quickly, and effortlessly both movements have been co opted. Never forget the real enemy is the banks, and the governments that enforce violence on their behalf.

<p>Ok, meme joke aside, I want to know if you think the ideology of the group that you were once a part of has fundamentally changed, and that's what happened here. Or, do you think that you've changed? I ask because if you think you've changed, it's important to learn the right lessons.</p>

        <p>The Overton window has shifted dramatically recently. 10 years ago I was hard left. In terms of social issues, fully libertarian left. I worked for a campaign to help legalize gay marriage where I lived. Pushed for racial equality and harmony.  No war. Public healthcare. Safety nets for people who lose their jobs or are unable to work. I still believe in all these things. However, if people like you and I aren’t in favor of socialism or communism, have questions about the BLM movement, disagree with corporations like Facebook and Twitter restricting speech, and aren’t on board with government mandated lockdowns, congratulations, we are now “far right.”</p>

        <p>Personally Conservative, politically libertarian/ would settle for ancap here... </p>
<p>Bruh in the feels. </p>
<p>Freedom is SO IMPORTANT. </p>
<p>Freedom is what allows people to live in harmony but believe in seperate things.</p>
<p>The NAP of the libertarians belief makes unity seem more possible. If only everyone could get behind it. </p>
<p>If you use government to pick off your opposing viewpoints and target groups, eventually you will be on that same list as the weapon gets bigger than the wielder. Aka  our governments. Globalism is so powerful at this point. We're all fucked unless the "woke" wake up to the REAL cause... Freedom. </p>
<p>i tried to join an anarchy page but got kicked out (reddit) because im not leftist and my personal beliefs are right leaning. How can the enemy of my enemy still want to be my enemy and why cant we all unite for the sake of having less owners telling us what to do and how to live? </p>
<p>Cant we storm the bastile and THEN hash out if we're capitalist or voluntarist or communist or socialiST??</p>
<p>AFTER the immediate threat to individualism and freedom is dealt with people can go off on their own and gather in the groups they want. </p>
<p>But no.. Instead we're all brainwashed to hate the other side and never listen to their points of view or find common ground. </p>
<p>Our common ground is freedom. Our common ground is that consent is the difference between slavery and mutual benefit.  No one wants to live in a world where they have no right to refuse xyz. We're all free range slaves at this point unless we break out of the bondage and wreck the cage and the chains like in 1776.</p>

        <p>Same here brother. I teach a class for a charity to aboriginal youth and Saturday (the day of Edmonton’s protest) was their final project presentation day. </p>
<p>So I drove to Calgary to attend a Sunday rally. </p>
<p>This is for all the marbles. I’d be protesting 7 days a week if I could. </p>
<p>Have you been going on Saturday’s? If not check it out. Good people good times.</p>

        <p>On the one hand, I'm glad you've had this awakening. It really messed with your mind, especially when you come out of it. I've helped a few friends who went through this, it's a very helpless time, not sure what/who to trust. What I can say about the Christians who turned you away is this: we're scared. Christians in China are being tortured for months to renounce Christ. In Canada we're being threatened and harassed. In the US, we have it good by comparison but is getting toasty and churches in liberal states are being watched, bullied, intimidated, and stalked.</p>
<p>As a result, any form of violence is often too much. A lot of the churches are taking this approach of just trying to not make waves. I understand it from a human preservation standpoint, but I don't think it's right to push others away that are defending you. Christians need to wake up just as badly, if not more so. They assume, especially in North America, that if you go to church and do your weekly thing you're safe and fine and that's all that's needed. Don't raise a fuss and don't get involved with politics. Meanwhile, the leaders are allowing bad actors to influence their flock, poisoning the spiritual well, and leading people into fear and inaction.</p>
<p>I say screw that. God didn't give me a spirit of fear and I darn well know he intended me to stand for what's right. Someone needs to remind them of that. You did the right thing to keep an open mind, and also to help others. Please don't feel alone. It sucks but you'll get through it, and you're no longer a walking zombie so that's a bonus.</p>

<p>“An aboriginal society must specify the area that has been continuously used and occupied…the aboriginal right of possession is based on the continued occupation and use of traditional tribal lands since the assertion of Crown sovereignty.” </p>
<p>– a quote from the Supreme Court of Canada’s Delgamuukw decision (1997). </p>
<p>a question here could be ... asking everyone in time and space ... is it a morally correct behaviour of this crown</p>
<p>( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia…">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbi</a>a ) to assert sovereignity over territories what have been known to be the traditional territories of indigenous nations ? </p>
<p>who gives this "supreme court of canada" the authority to demand of indigenous nations a proof of their connection to their traditional territories ? who is this crown what is supposed to be responsible for all this enormous and tedious work demanded from indigenous nations ? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_British_Columbia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_British_Columbia</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>thinking along the lines of ... from where does a crown draw its authority ... a crown what is after all the legalese complications made around it ... still a person, a human being believing to be a monarch ... believing to be appointed to govern over other human beings ... </p>
<p>and this line of thinking leads me to the speculation or guessing that the monarch draws its powers, its authority from the continuos belief and admiration the fellow human beings invest into its person, its function as a monarch </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>lucky me i am born in a space without monarchs </p>
<p>so i feel able to continue this thought experiment : </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>what if the human beings who identify themselves as citizens of the province of british columbia would recognise the legal structure of this province as centered around </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia</a></p>
<p>and "the assertion of Crown sovereignty" ... and as a following consequence of this recognition would want to spare the indigenous nations living in this area since before the arrival of the type of human beings claiming land to be under "Crown sovereignity" ... </p>
<p>spare the indigenous nations from having to deliver proof of their traditional way of live towards a "supreme court of canada" ... an institution the indigenous nations of this area have never given any kind of authority </p>
<p>similar as they have never given this crown </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia</a></p>
<p>any authority to rule over them ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>of course i am perhaps deluded or ignorant in these matters ... but if it would be correct that the indigenous nations today wishing to exercise full sovereignity over their </p>
<p>traditional territories what are claimed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia</a></p>
<p>to be under "crown sovereignity" ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>then perhaps the citizens of the province of british columbia could if they wanted ... consider diverting their support away from </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_in_British_Columbia</a></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>such a diversion of emotional and moral support / admiration / feeding powers to authority ...</p>

<p>could find its simple expression in a wish to change</p>

<p>( i believe this mentioning of stuff via wikipedia links saves me from being accused to meddle with the internal affairs of a foreign nation ... switzerland where i live is just in these days tightening its counter-terrorism laws ... but anyway ... all i am doing here is talking </p>
<p>about the psycho-dynamic flows of how authority to rule gets its powers from and how to possibly divert such powers via using the legal frameworks those have set up claiming "crown sovereignity" of the areas the province of british columbia claims to have the power of supremacy ? </p>
<p>oh i guess i messed it up here a bit ... playing the idiot ... or more probably being the idiot ... smile ... so the topic is ... could be ... constitutional reforms initiated by the citizens of the province british columbia ... with the intention to free the indigenous nations </p>
<p>of being opressed by "the supreme court of canada" what draws its self-given authority via "the assertion of Crown sovereignty" ... </p>
<p>reading trough </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>reveals that to get the crown concept removed from it would require "the unanimous consent of all the provinces plus the two Houses of Parliament." </p>
<p>what leads me to </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Members of the two houses of Parliament must also express their loyalty to the sovereign and defer to her authority, as the Oath of Allegiance must be sworn by all new parliamentarians before they may take their seats." </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>as if that was not a pretty solid construction to make sure the crown would not be abolished by the members of parliaments who have sworn oaths of allegiances to the very person ... allegiance to a human being ... to point that out ... which is referred to as "the sovereign"</p>

<p>the whole thing gets even more fortified when looking at </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>one of the two houses of parliament </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada</a></p>

<p>"The Senate of Canada (French: Sénat du Canada) is the upper house of the Parliament of Canada. The Senate is modelled after the British House of Lords and consists of 105 members appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister.[1]" </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>making me think that for a constitutional reform to be sucessfull in removing "the crown" / "the sovereign" ... the whole monarchy part ... it would need the unanimous consent of the members of the senate of canada what have been given their membership in this house of parliament </p>
<p>by one human being ... the </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>oh ... and to embark on a side trip here ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_of_the_Canadian_sovereign">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_of_the_Canadian_sovereign</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>says: </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Since 1953, the sovereign's style and titles in Canada are, in English:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.[2][3]" </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>which is actually so very interesting when one thinks of all this "doctrine of discovery" and "european supremacy" and "christian supremacy" ... all these </p>
<p>super-self-overestimations ... plus the whole history of colonialism and european empires plagueing harassing dominating </p>
<p>i dont know ... 50 to 75 percent of all lands where human beings have been and are still living ... but back to this title thing ... what reveals exactly all of this sickness ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>one person, one human being ... </p>
<p>who is called "the sovereign of canada"</p>
<p>wishes to be adressed as </p>
<p>appointed to this position of being the sovereign over all canada ( or all the human beings who identify themselves as canadians ? ) </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>by </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"the Grace of God" </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>she also wishes to be given the position of </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Defender of the Faith" </p>
<p>so here we have all laid out ... the whole source of the powers comes from this oaths of allegiance the members of parliaments are sworn into as well as from the members of canadian armed forces, human beings who are handling weapons for canada </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>in times where abolishing police and army has become an idea more and more people begin to believe to be a real option </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>( me too ... i would love to see a reality without courts/police/army/prisons )</p>

<p>its helpfull to know that in a monarchy, where the human being who is calling her-/himself "the sovereign" demands every human being living under its rule who is handling weapons to defend the governements and or the interpreters of laws ideas of what is okay and what not ... </p>
<p>she demands of all members of parliaments as well as all members of police and army to take an oath of allegiance to her </p>
<p>and she believes that "the grace of god" made her to be "the sovereign" over all people who indentify themselves as canadians ... and if that was not enough ... she also demands to be adressed as "Defender of the Faith" </p>
<p>so ... me feeling real crazy right now, like what am i doing here ... but lets get on with it ... this whole construction is pretty solid ... interweaving christian religion with domination powers of one human being positioning itself as having the authority to rule over millions </p>
<p>of human beings ... and this all happening today ... in 2020 on the occupied space what i might call ... if that is correct ... turtle island </p>
<p>but even when this whole constitutional reform thing looks to be a pretty heavy task ... what could be even more important ... is for this to be dismantled mentally ... to go trough it step by step ... see the flaws and faults in it from a position of a human being who does not </p>
<p>agree with the concept that one human being should be given the powers to rule over millions of fellow human beings ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there might be other ways how hundred thousands or millions of people could express an eventual disapproval </p>
<p>of the concept of a sovereign appointed by the grace of god defending the faith ... a concept what basicly puts everyone identifying as canadian into a place of being ruled over by a human being who believes to be appointed by a christian god </p>
<p>there might be a multitude of ways how millions of human beings could express their eventual unhappyness with being subjected to such a state of being ruled over by a monarch ... especially as that monarch has never attempted to revoke any of that "assertion of Crown sovereignty" </p>
<p>what is causing indigenous nations to spend a lot of effort documenting their relationship to their traditional territories ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>like ... i have been in sunday school of the christian style ... and i remember ... "say only one word and my soul shall be healty" </p>
<p>"sprich nur ein wort und meine seele wird gesund"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if she ...this one person, this human being who claims to be appointed by the grace of the christian god, defending the faith in this christian god...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if this one human being wants the soul of all human beings to be healty </p>
<p>all human beings who live on turtle island ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>than she speaks that word what takes away the "assertion of crown sovereignity"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>as clearly no one can truly be healthy in the soul when one is being dominated by an other human being </p>
<p>so even when constitutional reform seems to be a heavy task ... there are still petitions where millions of people could if they wanted ... write their names into a list to express their willingness to end this reign from this crown concept, end this monarchs reign as well as </p>
<p>have no next monarch ...but wish for the nation state of canada to give up its confrontational domination strategy of colonizing indigenous nations bribing them with billions of money what has been promised in exchange of oil, gas, wood,weapons etc. by global investment companies </p>
<p>a simple expression of disagreement ... like ... an anti-thesis to the oath of allegiance to the monarch ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>an oath to a future canada what respects all indigenous nations original territories and their full and undisputed sovereignity on it </p>
<p>a future canada what does not demand any proof from any indigenous nation but is a canada what gives thanks to the indigenous nations for being allowed to make use of some of the lands on turtle islands for those who identify as canadians </p>
<p>despite all the legalese and most complicated encapsulated thousands of pages of laws and laws in several layers of interconnectedness ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the raw primal magic what is applied in the colonizing ressource grabbing the earth and the human beings exploiting enterprise called </p>
<p>nation state of canada ... this primal raw magic is simple:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>set up a human being at the top of the structure ... let her demand all members of parliament and members of police and army to swear allegiance to her ... let her demand to be adressed as appointed by god </p>
<p>and laugh all the way to the bank while the ones who are at the bottom of this set up structure are trying to puzzle the pieces together how to get rid of this colonial empire structure </p>
<p>i guess there are a multitude of varieties how to dismantle this oppressive structure ... how to free indigenous nations of "assertion of crown sovereignity" ...</p>
<p>and all of them different paths are important expressions of ...i or we do not want to live under the rule of an other </p>
<p>human being ... i or we want to live in harmony with the fellow human beings which are neigbhours to us ... i or we wish for our neigbhours to be free from being ruled from above by a sovereign they never have sworn allegiance to</p>
