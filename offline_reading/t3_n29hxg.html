        <p>The most efficient way to reduce the population is to reduce the number of females, which is the same as making females infertile. Example, if there are 10 people on a desert island and 9 are women and 1 is a man, that one man can impregnate all 9 women and you’ll get 9 kids within a year and 9 every year after that.</p>
<p>If 1 is a woman and 9 are men, there will only be 1 baby per year. 9 kids vs 1 kid annually. Obviously making men infertile too would reduce population the fastest but just targeting women would be enough to achieve a drastic reduction.</p>
<p>Edit: This just came to me: that’s why wars are inefficient in population reduction. It is mostly males who are killed but that does not make an impact. They bounce right back because there are plenty of women left to produce babies.</p>

        <p>The article literally says that period discharges are getting thicker, which means there were more nutrients in the placenta. They're not making the women infertile. The scientists also say this problem is easily fixable, so stop panicking and fear-mongering.</p>
<p>&rt;When asked whether she thinks the vaccine is harmful to women who are experiencing these cycle changes and if it affect fertility, Dr. Huddleston said, "No. So what I would say is that just in the same way that some women and men have had a sore arm, after the vaccine, or maybe felt tired, maybe had even a low grade fever, these are all things that people experienced in a very short term way after the vaccine. And within a few days, people are back to normal." <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But if these menstrual cycle changes are also sort of linked into that upregulation of the immune system that we're seeing, then I would view that in the same way I would view a sore arm. It's a nuisance, it's troubling in that moment, but it's not a representation of something that's going to continue. It's not a representation of any sort of permanent harm or damage. There is no reason to think there's reason to be concerned over time, and there's no reason to think that there's any impact on fertility." </p>

        <p>I didn’t say the vaccines are sterilizing women. I was just suggesting how populations can be reduced. People on this sub don’t all have the same views you know. And the jury is still out regarding what the vaccines can do to the body long term. The full testing was never carried out. One doctor can say it is safe now, but as you know, she doesn’t know long term effects any more than the vaccine creators and the rest of us.</p>

        <p>Okay, I was just saying that these specific reactions this picture was talking about was not due to vaccines. The long-term effects of COVID are not known either, so it could easily be more dangerous than a vaccine. The difference is that we know exactly what is in vaccines and how they work, while the functionality and effects of all parts of the virus's genome have not been extensively and detailed, although they have been sequenced.</p>

        <p>This is totally contrary to everything I've ever heard about viruses, do you have further reading or information on this? As far as I understand, viruses are very specific sequences of genetic code that, when injected into a cell susceptible to this malicious genetic code, repurposes the cell into making more viruses. Toxins would just be waste or random things being where they aren't suppose to be, viruses are like fine-tuned hijacking and reproduction instructions.</p>

<p>I’m still reading up on it but it’s definitely interesting. Makes some sense from all those times I didn’t get sick when around really sick people. Also germ theory is a great money maker vs just having people be healthy 🤷‍♂️</p>

        <p>That’s what you’ve been told, yes. However a virus has never been isolated to prove this beyond a reasonable doubt. A virus has also never been demonstrated through the scientific method to cause infection. It’s just a widely accepted assumption.</p>

        <p>What do you mean viruses can't do anything? Viruses transfect their DNA (or RNA) into host cells, then hijack the cellular machinery to produce more copies of themselves. This viral progeny then goes on to infect more cells, causing any number of diseases. How is that not doing anything?</p>

        <p>Viruses don’t do what you’re describing. They can’t, they are dead. Someone told you they do this and you believe them, which was a reasonable thing to do. That being said, this idea of what a virus can “do” is based on germ theory. Germ theory is incorrect and has been refuted by many scientists and professionals.</p>

        <p>How come they don't do what I'm describing? Hasn't it already been demonstrated by Ivanovsky and Beijerinck that Tobacco mosaic virus causes Tobacco mosaic disease through Pasteur-Chamberland filtration? The majority opinion is that viruses straddle the line between living and dead, rather than being simply dead, although there are virologists who believe they are living organisms (because they evolved). </p>

        <p>Germ theory, or a virus causing infection, cannot be demonstrated using the scientific method.</p>
<p>"Human beings, the potentially highest form of life expression on this planet have built the vast pharmaceutical industry for the central purpose of poisoning the lowest form of life on the planet--germs! One of the biggest tragedies of human civilization is the precedence of chemicals over nutrition."--Dr. Richard Murray
"In the sciences, people quickly come to regard as their own personal property that which they have learned and had passed on to them at the universities and academies. If someone else comes along with new ideas that contradict the Credo and in fact even threaten to overturn it, then all passions are raised against this threat and no method is left untried to suppress it. People resist it in every way possible: pretending not to have heard about it; speaking disparagingly of it, as if it were not even worth the effort of looking into the matter. And so a new truth can have a long wait before finally being accepted."--Goethe</p>

<p>This doesn't appear to be true. Read Stanley's 1946 Nobel prize lecture on the isolation and properties of the Tobacco mosaic virus. He outlined the scientific procedure for isolation of the virus, which he precipitated out of an infectious solution as a crystalline material. Stanley then infected plants with the same material, causing Tobacco mosaic disease.</p>

        <p>I’m a bit confused how we jumped from “vaccine causes menstrual cycle changes” to “vaccine causes female infertility” tbh. Women know that any number of things can cause cycle changes - new medication, eating too much/not enough, exercise, stress...list goes on. So seems like a big assumption to assume this equals sterilization, unless I’m missing something?</p>
<p>Note I am EXTREMELY anti lockdown, but if we’re shilling inaccurate info we’re no better than them</p>

<p>You’re the one scared of a virus, not us. We’re not fear mongering we are exposing the tactics of those who are deceiving us. It’s absolutely insane to defend an experimental gene therapy which causes <em>any</em> change to a woman’s cycle. Defending something that has no basis in research is disingenuous and <em>dangerous</em> to the general public. You’re telling people to inject themselves with something that is untested because <em>your opinion</em> is that it is safe and women “will be fine.”</p>

        <p>You're the one creating side-effects and saying that vaccines make you infertile when that's not true. If that's not fear-mongering, I don't know what is. </p>
<p>Okay, you don't know what gene therapy is and you don't know how mRNA vaccines work, and you didn't read what I wrote about why the cycles got TEMPORARILY altered, so I will teach you. mRNA is a form of genetic material present in all cells in all organisms on this planet. m stands for messenger (messenger RNA). All of the human's genetic material is stored in the nucleus as DNA. This DNA is transcribed/copied into RNA, so that the information of the DNA can be transported (messaged) out of the nucleus, where ribosomes use the RNA's information to make specific proteins that do certain functions (Some examples of proteins include hormones and water channels that facilitate the movement of water between cells). One protein you may have heard of is COVID's spike protein, which allows the virus to gain access into cells (like a key to the cell's lock). The virus gains entry into the cell, and uses the cell's ribosomes to read the viral RNA to make more spike proteins, so that more viral particles can be created (watch an animation that explains this better). The immune system notices these alien cell membrane proteins (this means they sit on the cell's external surface), and tries to kill that cell. But due to the sheer speed that COVID can spread, it makes COVID dangerous, able to overpower our immune system or allow us to succumb to pneumonia and inflamed throat/lungs (signs of immune system trying to fight the virus). As the viruses multiply and escape, they line the lungs or enter the air we breathe out, allowing us to spread it to others. If the person defeats the virus, then T cells will create antibodies that latch onto the spike proteins so that these spike proteins can be identified quicker, resulting in increased immunity. Vaccines do this same thing, without subjecting people to the actual virus. The vaccine contains a portion of the virus's mRNA, which codes for a spike protein (and nothing else from the viral genetic material, which would be harmful and cause it to act like the virus itself), so that human's cell can do the same thing and trigger a immune response (the "same thing" is that the mRNA is used to make spike proteins, which are expressed on the cell's surface). The same thing is accomplished in the same way whether you get the virus or get the vaccine. However, the vaccine allows you to do the same thing in a safer way than getting the virus. Notice how I did not once mention your body's DNA or the nucleus in my explanation. This is because the vaccine and the virus do not touch your cell's nucleus or your cell's DNA, so it is not gene therapy. There is no alteration to your body's DNA. Furthermore, the changes to the menstrual cycle is not being caused by the mRNA, it's being caused by immune reaction to the spike protein, which is regular in any vaccine or virus response. </p>
<p>Like I said, actually read what I wrote in my comment and read about how vaccines/viruses/etc. work instead of being uninformed and throwing a hissy fit with no reason or logic behind it. I don't have "blind faith" in pharmaceutical companies. The companies have no say in what's in the vaccines. All they do is produce what the scientific researchers develop. The scientists publish their research for people to see. They publish how the vaccines work, they publish what's in the vaccines, and more. Everything is completely transparent, so I can read for myself and see everything they're doing. The published the results of their multitude of tests, detailing their methods, results, etc. They found that the vaccines worked and were safe, which we can determine when we look at their results too, so they gave the green light for countries to buy the vaccines. It's not untested by any means, and none of what I said is my opinion. I'm telling you logical conclusions based on real numbers and results.</p>
<p>You guys are selectively ignoring reason and facts to push your baseless narrative, AKA fear mongering.</p>

<p>by opening up the country, not giving the people free healthcare, not mandating masks to protect others, not having a sufficient supply of a medicine that can cure a curable disease, and uh... being ignorant of your people.</p>
<p>you americans have no right to say you're being controlled by your government because of covid when you're literally being tracked by your ISP while using your mobile phone, pc, consoles and anything that connects to the internet. your data is being sold to companies that shove advertisements in your face, the police can track your gps information. not to mention there are CCTV cameras in literally every fucking street, and if there are no CCTV cameras there are people with smartphones that takes high quality videos that they share everywhere.</p>
<p>and you blame it on a cure for a virus for causing side effects. you know the biggest side effect of covid? its death. how about that. you die no matter what so why not die healthy?</p>

        <p>You must have amnesia then - people had "non-essential" surgeries cancelled (this doesn't mean plastic surgery, it means things like joint replacement which really do have an impact on health), cancer screenings/treatments cancelled, doctor appointments cancelled. To me this looks very much like "preventing people from getting healthcare".</p>

        <p>My family's doctor appointments were never canceled, so I didn't know about that (if what you're saying is even true). There have been numerous people that have gotten surgeries if it was critical to their health. A joint replacement is for comfort, and is not an emergency that is time-sensitive. These cancer treatment delays and other things are based on individual risk. They are not just denied to everyone, but the urgent necessity is scrutinized to ease the load on healthcare in general. In addition, getting COVID poses a HUGE risk to compromised people like those with cancer and other illnesses. Unless the appointments can be done with utmost safety, it is not wise to just call everyone in when it is not critical to their health.</p>

Why are you even in this Reddit sub when you clearly have your little agenda?  Why do you people LOVE the COVID pandemic like a religion?  We aren't people allowed to point out the inconsistencies in this silly game we are playing? Why can't you people leave us, the fuck, alone?!?... oh.. and FUCK YOU!...

        <p>&rt;you know the biggest side effect of covid? its death</p>
<p>It's so bizarre how you people ignore the fact that nearly everyone who gets the coof lives, and nearly everyone who died with it died from multiple comorbidities and were 80+ years old.</p>
<p>Hmm. It seems like you want the virus to be a bigger deal so you ignore the good news that it isn't that bad so you can keep larping as a hero and give your life meaning without having to actually try hard at something or take on risk.</p>

        <p>my healthy uncle who was in his early 40s, had no illnesses, he worked out every week and never smoked once in his life. didnt have asthma or heart problems. got covid and died 2 weeks later. i know how it feels to lose a family member so i take care of myself my family and my friends. yes the death rate is really low. but its certainly much much higher than the side effects that the vaccine gives you.</p>

        <p>Sorry about your uncle. Really. You have to realize though that your uncle is a <em>gigantic</em> statistic anomaly, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities">based on CDC data</a>. The CDC report there clearly states that (and I'm quoting)</p>
<p>&rt; "For over 5% of these deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned on the death certificate. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 4.0 additional conditions or causes per death."</p>
<p>There have been around 557k deaths for which COVID-19 is listed in the death certificate (note: not that have been <em>directly caused</em> by COVID-19, which is what happened to your uncle). Of those 557k, around 16k have been in ages between 40 and 49 years - so, around 3%. Of that 3%, assuming linear distribution (which is a huge "favor" I'm making you, as it is going to surely be heavily skewed towards the elderly), only a 5% has been caused by COVID-19 alone - so, 0.15%.</p>
<p>Your uncle has been one of the (approximately) 830 americans between 40 and 49 that has died of COVID-19 alone since the beginning of the pandemic. There's around 20 million americans aged 40 to 49. Kind of hard to deduce an IFR from that, but it's in the low 0.0x%, at worst. Driving 100 miles is way riskier statistically, just to give you an idea of how incredibly unlucky and statistically unlikely was for your health 40 years old uncle to die from this.</p>
<p>You want to take an experimental drug that they call vaccine but it's nothing like a traditional one, that has never been before used except on small scale trials, for which we do not know the long term effects of, in order to avoid a risk of death statistically comparable to driving 100 miles with your car,? Be my guest. Really. Have at it. If you think that the probability of death "[is] certainly much much higher" than the probability of the aforementioned experimental drug messing up with you, go for it and tell all your friends.</p>
<p>Just don't force it on me and on the rest of us that are still able to do math in 2021. Also, while you're at it, given that you're younger than your uncle, if the level of risk involved with catching covid is not something you're comfortable with, you should lock yourself in your home, remove all electronic appliances you have, coat your whole house with bubble wrap, and never dare to walk down a flight of stairs again. Just driving to the vaccination site is way riskier for you than catching covid.</p>

        <p>You guys really need to get a basic understanding on how and why comorbidities are listed on a death certificate. Take a look at that CDC list. Covid can cause a number of more acute complications, including blood clots, heart attacks, pneumonia, sepsis, ARDS, respiratory failure etc. So when those are listed on the death certificate they aren't pre-existing conditions, they often developed as a direct result of covid, and signify what aspect of the disease weakened and then killed them. </p>
<p>Saying that only 5% of covid deaths are only from covid is a complete misunderstanding of the nature of comorbidities.</p>
<p>It's kinda like saying a serial killer only was solely responsible for 5% of his victims because only 5% of the murder reports had the serial killer listed as the only cause of death. The others had comorbidities like 'gunshot wounds', 'lacerations' and 'strangulation'. On average, each victim had 4 wounds!</p>

        <p>If you ask me, that's more of a problem related to how this is reported. The granularity of the data there doesn't allow for distinguishing between "conditions" and "<em>preexisting</em> conditions" - we don't know what the CDC exactly means by that. One would assume that a <em>condition</em> is something that is inherently preexistent, but we can't know for sure.</p>
<p>A good way to proxy that would be to look at countries where that information is available - Italy, for example. <a href="https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-decessi-italia#3">According to the 'Italian' CDC, the ISS</a> of all 106.789 people died with a positive covid test in 28 days up until march 30, a grand total of <em>282</em> (about 0.1%) had 40 years or less. Of those 282, <em>38</em> had NO preexisting conditions of any kind. That's about 13%.</p>
<p>Now, we can argue that 13% is almost 3 times as 5%. We cannot argue that covid alone killed 500k+ people in the US. I would love to have that <em>preexisting</em> specified in the CDC statistics, I wonder why they don't do it - they have the data. </p>
<p>If we are to add, I would <em>love</em> to grab every single medical journal of those 38 people that supposedly died from covid alone in Italy since February 2020. I'd <em>love</em> it. I wonder how many car crashes are in there.</p>

        <p>Where would the border be between conditions and preexisting conditions - preexisting to what? How far can you backdate a condition from when it's diagnosed? The dataset would be huge, almost impossible to report correctly, way more labor intensive and not really give all that more data.

<p>First of all, why are you suddenly shifting from talking about people in their 40s to people <em>under</em> the age of 40?</p>
<p>"No clinical information is available on 80 patients under 40 years of age"</p>
<p>You skipped a pretty important part there. Is it most likely that they had had no clinical information about patients who had preexisting conditions? Or is it more likely that these patients didn't have clinical records because they don't have any preexisting conditions. My money is on a significant number of those having no records because they don't have preexisting conditions. And the way you calculated the percentage, you assumed they all had preexisting conditions. You're hardly being unbiased in your interpretation of the numbers.</p>
<p>If we neutrally assume that those without clinical information are distributed exactly like the ones with clinical information, the people without preexisting conditions are at least 18% of the deaths.</p>
<p>&rt;every single medical journal of those 38 people that supposedly died from covid alone in Italy </p>
<p>How did you suddenly end up at only 38 in all of Italy dead from only covid? Is being 40+ suddenly a preexisting condition?</p>

        <p>&rt; Where would the border be between conditions and preexisting conditions - preexisting to what?</p>
<p>Preexisting to Covid. That's why they're "preexisting" in the context of covid. That's sort of the definition of the word.</p>
<p>&rt; How far can you backdate a condition from when it's diagnosed? The dataset would be huge, almost impossible to report correctly, way more labor intensive and not really give all that more data.</p>
<p>You know that every single patient in the healthcare system has a journal with every single health data regarding that patient in it, right?</p>
<p>&rt; First of all, why are you suddenly shifting from talking about people in their 40s to people under the age of 40?</p>
<p>Because that's what's available in detail. Wanna run the same numbers against the CDC one for 30-39? Or even for 0-39? You'll find an order or two of magnitude of risk <em>less</em>. I'm doing you a favor, so to speak.</p>
<p>&rt; "No clinical information is available on 80 patients under 40 years of age"</p>
<p>Those have been the same since when they started collecting data. My guess is that they didn't start collecting data in detail before then, so I assume them to have the same distribution of the other sample. Let's include them - every single one of them - in the "does not have a preexisting condition group". How does it look like now? We're at 80+38=118/282 now. Way less than 50%. Are you ok saying that of the 500k+ american that died with a positive PCR test, way less than half didn't actually die from covid?</p>
<p>&rt; How did you suddenly end up at only 38 in all of Italy dead from only covid? Is being 40+ suddenly a preexisting condition?</p>
<p>Ahem? 38 people younger than 40 died in Italy from covid with no preexisting conditions. I haven't said otherwise. I'd love to see their journals. Of course I can't and since investigative journalism is dead worldwide nobody with the right access to the data will for me.</p>

        <p>It's very similar to the plot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Six_(novel)">Rainbow Six the novel</a> that the games are based off of originally..</p>
<p>"The resulting epidemic would kill millions, and Horizon would distribute a "vaccine" that actually contains a slow-acting version of the virus itself, which would then kill the rest of the world's population. The "chosen few", having been provided with the real vaccine, would then be allowed to inherit the emptied world. "</p>

        <p>The article literally says that period discharges are getting thicker, which means there were more nutrients in the placenta. They're not making the women infertile. The scientists also say this problem is easily fixable, so stop panicking and fear-mongering.</p>
<p>&rt;When asked whether she thinks the vaccine is harmful to women who are experiencing these cycle changes and if it affect fertility, Dr. Huddleston said, "No. So what I would say is that just in the same way that some women and men have had a sore arm, after the vaccine, or maybe felt tired, maybe had even a low grade fever, these are all things that people experienced in a very short term way after the vaccine. And within a few days, people are back to normal." <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;But if these menstrual cycle changes are also sort of linked into that upregulation of the immune system that we're seeing, then I would view that in the same way I would view a sore arm. It's a nuisance, it's troubling in that moment, but it's not a representation of something that's going to continue. It's not a representation of any sort of permanent harm or damage. There is no reason to think there's reason to be concerned over time, and there's no reason to think that there's any impact on fertility." </p>
<p>The source is the article which the mod comment linked.</p>
<p>You guys are fear-mongering without looking at the evidence and thinking for yourselves, come on. Don't blindly follow what conspiracy theorists say.</p>
<p>Just read for 30 seconds before blasting false information.</p>
