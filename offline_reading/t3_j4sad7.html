        <p>What gets me is that people freely go out for non-essential reasons wearing a mask feeling invincible even though they are the ones saying to take it seriously. Don't leave your home you psychopath and spread the virus.</p>
<p>Oblivious to the concept that everyone has varying levels of concern. But society is supposed to conform to their comfort at any time.  </p>

        <p>Licking down and social distancing? Those two things sound mutually exclusive :-). I wouldn’t say there’s no prior evidence of the such. It’s long been known how respiratory droplets and aerosols transmit viruses. The transmission of virions contained within droplets and aerosols has been studied, and studied, and studied - long before Covid came about. Are all masks effective at stopping these? No - especially not aerosols. But saying that a recommendation of social distancing is akin to literally pulling random recommendations out of thin air is just simply not true, and it’s quite the false analogy. I can tell you that, in my case, I wear masks in certain situations not because I was told to, but due to my education in a field of science, I understand the concepts that underlie mask recommendations. I also don’t wear masks in certain situations (like when I’m walking outside with my kid) because I understand the concepts that underlie mask recommendations, and there’s literally no fucking reason for me to wear a mask outside, with nobody within thirty feet (and trust me, I’ve gotten some dirty looks). And you saying the only way this ends with is with retaliation...that’s scary. And needless. I think that first and foremost, instead of demonizing each other for our views, we need to come together and hash it out. There’s merit that can be found in both sides of this debate - but not if we continue to treat each other like shit because of this one issue.</p>

        <p>Thanks for presenting your view in a reasonable way! I have a few questions if i may...</p>
<p>So, given that you accept that masks are not effective in preventing aerosol spread, why do you syill wear them under certain circumstances, and ehat are those circumstances?</p>
<p>What do you believe is the end game? Do you think wr need to practice social distancing until a vaccine is ready, and what happens if the vaccine isnt effective?</p>
<p>What do you think of the "collatoral damage" from the lockdowns, the crashing economy, the missed cancer treatments etc</p>

        <p>Not OP but I'll try to offer so info.</p>
<p>The discussion around masks should really be one of "risk vs benefit analysis" which is what the OP is saying they have done using their own knowledge. When politicians say "everyone should wear a mask all the time" that's bullshit. There is absolutely no evidence that says that will help and there is a lot of evidence that says it is bad news and would help transmit the virus instead of slow it. High risk, low benefit.</p>
<p>If you are around old people or someone who is at high risk of complications from the virus then mitigation should be performed. In the list of mitigation techniques wrapping a face around your mask is low in the priority list, under "do it outdoors," "don't go anywhere near them in the first place," and "stay 6 feet away". If you can follow the protocol for donning and doffing the mask and not contaminate yourself then really there is little issue for most people to wear one. Even in the face of science not being settled we can still do risk vs benefit analysis. Low risk, some possible benefit.</p>
<p>Neither side is very good at doing this kind of analysis but anti-maskers are more right than the pro-maskers.</p>

        <p>Many of the founding fathers of the United States believed that the Government should be afraid of it's people not that the people should be afraid of the government. The Michigan legislature had to watch these guys with rifles standing in the balcony of the chambers while they voted on some Coronavirus laws. <a href="https://media2.fdncms.com/metrotimes/imager/u/original/24490347/michgian_capitol_dayna_polehanki.jpg">https://media2.fdncms.com/metrotimes/imager/u/original/24490347/michgian_capitol_dayna_polehanki.jpg</a> That photograph was taken with the cell phone of one of the members of the legislature from inside the chambers.</p>
<p>Personally I'm not positive of how much of a good or bad idea that was but they were scared. Michigan started shifting the policies not long after that point and now we are left with their dictator governor ignoring the legislature stripping her of her powers and then the courts telling her that she has to stop because of it.</p>

        <p>I would have to agree with you here. They will never give up the amount of unquestioned, unopposed power they have gained. The only thing that would get our lives back is people standing up against this shit. Given the 90+% compliance, I dont see that happening. </p>
<p>Man I just can't believe this has been going on so long and people aren't getting pissed.</p>

        <p>No one is saying that the virus is a hoax, we are just saying that all of these precautions are not necessary, and are just ruining people's lives, just to "save" a small portion of the population. If you want to, you can say inside forever, but the rest of us want to get back to living our lives, and we should have that right!</p>
