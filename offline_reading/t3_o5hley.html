    <strong>I’m a doctor and I feel like I can’t speak out</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a doctor in the UK. I refuse to get the vaccine. But when anyone asks me if I’ve had it, I just say yes, because you are looked down upon like toxic waste if you say ANYTHING negative about the scamdemic/vaccines etc. I feel suffocated because I can’t speak my mind. As fruitless as it is, I have the urge to share No New Normal articles and posts on social media to combat the bombardment of “I GOT MY VACCINE I AM SUPERIOR TO YOU ALL. WEAR A MASK STOP BEING SELFISH” posts I see all over my social media. But I’m terrified of the repercussions because what if someone reports me because I’m a doctor and I’m “supposed” to be pro vaccine. I’m tired of wearing this sweaty muzzle all day. Patients can’t hear me, colleagues can’t hear me, I have anxiety and am normally short of breath any way and the muzzle makes it even worse. Then I have a two hour twice daily commute on the bus where I’m forced to keep the sweaty muzzle on. It’s all too much.</p></p>

        <p>I feel you. Me and my wife are very pro-science and value critical, honest thinking. We have spent time in research in our fields etc. </p>
<p>Last winter I started to have some doubts on the news and started digging a bit further. After half an hour it was clear the numbers were not supporting the narrative, but quite contrary. I was slightly shocked, and the more I dug the more obvious it all became. Funny thing was I was very careful to communicate this even to my wife, but once the vaccine rollout started we touched the subject and found both to think this smells a lot, but we haven't spoken up to anyone because saying anything counter-narrative is taken as crazy talk. I feel intellectually suffocated because there is absolutely no logical exchange of information and ideas, but all is forced to fit the narrative.</p>
<p>Funny anecdote: once I realized the numbers don't add up I tested the atmosphere on a math forum. I took the numbers and placed a question in a form of homework to calculate the false positive rate of Covid-tests, but used different context with no mentions of Covid. I got some correct answers confirming that the false positive rate is 50%+ based on the data. After the answers I posted the source data from Lancet and official sources with links. Needles to say I got fiercly attacked by the very same person who made the calculations. It was a total wake-up moment. Death threats and conspiracy theory accusations over a simple calculation they performed on publicly available data.</p>

        <p>We need more people being outspoken about this issue. We can harp on it all day long in our little bubble here in nonewnormal, but the real change is only going to come when we step outside. </p>
<p>I’m sure many people feel just like you, maybe they just need a little reassurance that it is okay to go against the grain and speak how they feel aloud without shame. </p>
<p>The more people who go out into the world and speak their mind, the more people will follow suit. </p>
<p>If you’re sick of this, then I can guarantee that there are many who feel the same. The world needs to know we exist.</p>

        <p>I have a serious question for you as a doctor:</p>
<p>Are you in a position to mark people down as "vaccinated" even if they're not? Are GP's able to do that?</p>
<p>We're fast approaching a time where free people might need to have fake vax certificates to live normally. Need plenty of doctors willing to do this, despite the risk of losing your medical license.</p>

        <p>Look at Eric Clapton speaking out there in the UK. Simply, honestly. Suddenly he's a real hero to me. And allies are coming to his side. </p>
<p>Look at me dropping out of college here in California because the vaccines have become mandated for students. I used to do what you've done, say "not yet" or even "yes." But with digital passports tied to RealID and our medical records coming quickly, I can't lie anymore. And since I can't lie I have to be courageous enough to speak the truth. And change my life. </p>
<p>Everything has changed. Those of use who see what's really happening and refuse to comply with the new world order are going to have to fight or die. Those of us who see what's really happening and submit out of fear are already dead.</p>
<p>It's up to each of to choose which path to take. I hope I see you on the path of most resistance.</p>
