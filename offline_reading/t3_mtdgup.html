        <p>To sum it up he used to be a representative from 2013 to 2018. In 2018 he won by an extremely narrow margin (less than 1%) against his opponent for governor (Andrew Gillum) who was later photographed naked and overdosed on opioids. Then 2020 came around and he decided to reopen well before other states (besides South Dakota) and gained traction with many people because of his stance against lockdowns and other restrictions. Now in many instances he handles press extremely well. How many people view it is that he has all the good qualities trump had plus more without the downsides. Especially better handling of media.</p>

        <p>It won't matter.  He likely won't even be reelected in Florida.  Stacy is just across the border.  That COVID death data "whistleblower" will get her CNN exposes for months when gubernatorial campaigning ramps up.  Some dickweed lib will shit on the state.  I say this as somebody moving there very soon.  DiSantis is going to get steamrolled and Broward County is going to cram its corrupt shitty agenda down their throat.  The biggest benefits Florida are that it's surrounded on 3 sides by water, it can feed itself, and Dade county is full of gang members who hate socialism horribly.  Read about Sicily during Mussolini.  That's Florida.</p>

        <p>He’s likely to run for president and if he keeps this energy he will have my vote. He’s singing all the right songs for me right now. We need someone with balls who is a better speaker than Trump. I enjoyed the shit out of Trump minus the absolute bullshit he did with bump stocks and a few other decisions but his speaking skills were very weak in terms of appealing to a crowd. </p>
<p>Someone like Trump with the silver tongue of Obama could probably woo even some die hard liberals over. He’s be akin to Ronald Reagan.</p>

        <p>Even if he were elected simply based on doing great things during this shitshow, I still have no faith that he wouldn't cut spending.  Which is basically pissing in the wind at this point, but the global currency system is an abject disaster, not just here, everywhere.  </p>
<p>In that regard, Trump was one of the worst president's ever.  The stock market has to be allowed to crash.  You have to allow an actual interest rate so that banks don't hold everything like they do and invest it for you into tech companies who just continually get more powerful.  There's so many fucked up things at this point, maybe I expect too much because maybe all any of us can hope for is the president to actually make sure civil liberties exist.</p>

        <p>His story will be written in 2022-2023 by CNN and NYT in which they parade a bunch of accusers for misconduct in the 80s. </p>
<p>Alternatively, Kamala Harris will become new president as Biden will not be able to escape his basement and Andrew Cuomo will be slotted in as VP, running on the Pulitzer Prize he wins for being the greatest US Governor during COVID.</p>
