    <strong>Have you noticed that people around you are crazier since vaccine rollout?</strong>
    <p><p>Since the rollout of the vaccine I’ve noticed people seem like they’re on an antipsychotic that’s just not working for them or on too much coke. Body shops are full and backed up. The police, fire, emt are overworked. Fights in the parking lot, red light get out of the car road rage and such.  It’s gotten noticeably worse in the last 3 months for me.  Easily described as —a person has mild rage already, then has 6 shots of tequila in 10 minutes on an empty stomach- that’s what I’m seeing.</p></p>

        <p>Mental Health is shot to shit. I stay inside most days as people I know are like zombies. In fact it is mostly those that are pro the agenda that have the worst anger/rage issues. It’s strange why people who are fighting against this agenda are actually much calmer and level headed....maybe because we just carried on as normal.</p>

        <p>This is an interesting correlation and one I've noticed too. I live in an area where majority of people have gone along with things, some businesses still requiring masks despite loosening of mandates, people still wearing masks when they don't have to etc and yes they also seem the most neurotic. Drive 1.5 hours to visit my parents where things have been much more relaxed and it's almost life as normal, people are happy, going about their lives, smiling at others etc.</p>

        <p>It was the exact opposite for us when we visited my parents in a much worse affected area. They came outside in masks and gloves to greet us...I unleashed my two year old toddler like a Covid bomb into their house and within 24 hours they had completely returned to being normal human beings once they realised their terrible mistake and what they had been missing. It’s not going to be easy to break down all of the glass houses around people though sadly. Many won’t find a way back.</p>

        <p>I am sorry to hear that your parents were so fearful but I am glad you helped bring them back to earth a bit! A lot of my experience has to do with the county I live in vs my parents (blue vs red, not to make things political but just the way things have worked out ha). We traveled out of state for 3 months this winter and tried to explain how in these other places people were going about life almost like normal and people living here under strict mandates couldn't believe it. I've basically gotten to a point where if people want to continue wearing masks the rest of their lives than so be it. But please don't force that fear upon others to do the same</p>

        <p>Yes I try to follow what’s going on over the pond so I would firmly sit in a red state. Blue looks terrifying. Here we have no red pills in power they’re all blue, in fact the opposing party is more navy than the blue government in charge. The south where I am seems to be way more red pill and the north have just suffered so much more because of case numbers so restrictions have been pressed upon them and they remained locked down while we were allowed to go back to normal, that made the division here much much worse.</p>

        <p>Yup, this past Jan we literally couldn't handle the illogical mandates/winter/sitting in our apt any more and left for Fl and SC for three months. After being locked down here it was glorious. At one point we came back for a week, quickly said F this and left again. It's so hard watching people walk around outside alone wearing a mask (or tolerating people asking us to wear them) after being in places where life had carried on as normal. Now I (and a few likeminded others)  wonder that as our mandates slowly lift, come fall/winter a "new bug/flu/something scary" will come along and we'll be locked down again.</p>

        <p>Well it also strongly affects people who would have continued normally w/o all this restrictions. E.g. when I walk with my dog in a forest where you maybe see one person on 1 km. 
They wear masks in the forest, they fear and react angrily against me or my dog (bulldog with heavy breathing) who could transmit covid. There is basically no social contact possible since start of covid because everybody just fears somebody who doesn’t wear a mask outdoor. Not to mention the categorizing. Without a mask you are a right extremist.</p>

        <p>I’m seeing this too! Maybe it’s cause we’ve been through this before, being on the fringe because we think for ourselves so our opinions don’t fall in like with societies.</p>
<p>I kind of saw the same thing when BLM started shedding light on systematic racism, and before that when pronouns and the LGBTQ community were getting more recognition. These white men acted like someone just kicked their shin.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the first time some people are feeling oppressed in their lives? Maybe it’s pent up energy from being indoors too much?</p>

        <p>I know it’s not great and as far as grouping people, I know folks who are open minded and anti vax, but they still feel like everyone in the US has an equal opportunity and get offended by having to use pronouns. They are all white 🤷‍♀️ 
Racism is an issue that people don’t like to face.</p>

        <p>Yeah that’s a fair point man, grown adults shouldn’t be acting like kids. Shits just weird nowadays, only seems to be getting worse too. I would say people are letting their inhibitions down like waaaaaaaaaaay down. We just had our first kid, and I like to think that’s helped me mellow out a bit.</p>

But I think it’s a frustration coming from realising they have been lied to.
They took the shots like a good sheep and still got bamboozled and didn’t get this life back.</p>

        <p>If you want an example of this I'd like you to read this little tid bit....</p>
<p>I'm from a very small place and I mean small.. the capital is less then 500,000 small.</p>
<p>Since last year, we've been in constant lock down and uplifts.... (I think 7 so far?) All of them extended well beyond what the "experts" told us prior. Every local business shut down for 2 months.. zilch, nadda, nothing for 2 months. Couldn't even get a pack of smokes. </p>
<p>The people here are already lacking in education (albeit maybe just my bias) and drugs and alcohol have run rampant here since the early 90s so combine all that and let me explain.</p>
<p>We've had a increase in crime (theft, mischief, etc), people HAVE gotten more aggressive. The whole "pick and choose your friend group" got everybody segregated into groups then segregated again into smaller groups. </p>
<p>People post online things such as "non compliance, fines, jail time, assaults even" for people who even dare breathe against the lock down. </p>
<p>Our government office postponed our election and had everyone do mail in votes. He was definitely not set up to remain in office and when they shut down the elections and everybody did mail in.. he somehow got to majority from two of the less populated areas on the island.</p>
<p>We've been introduced 3 new sets of taxes as well. Apparently we've spent well over 2bil for a place populated only by 500k at the most. </p>
<p>So on top of all this and you add a supposedly deadly pandemic and well.. I'm surprised we ain't killing each other yet down here.</p>
<p>Oh ALSO, WE CAN'T LEAVE THE ISLAND UNLESS WERE VACCINATED.</p>

Still there’s around half of people wearing masks and they look at you funny for not wearing one. The only ok places are bars. Nobody cares there.</p>

        <p>We remain hush hush about the bar scenes here... no one mentioned anything about masks because, well... everyone's an alcoholic and yeah.</p>
<p>There's a snitch line here for people who disobey the restrictions.</p>
<p>We've only now started to considering reopening the place and the people in my feed are mad crazy about it. None of them wants to place to open and no one seems to have any actual reason why. Everyone's just spouting the same shit they were told a year ago. All of the new information and we're stuck behind by a complete year.</p>
<p>Our radio everyday non stop is spouting "covid, covid, covid". Right now I'm listening to it and the people that call in just don't even know anything besides what's happening here.. and only here.</p>

        <p>I was holding off on saying this for awhile because I could be wrong and this is admittedly anecdotal but the few people I know who got the shot, co-workers and family members it's my impression they're suffering from a kind of prolonged brain fog.  A couple got the J&amp;J shot and the rest got Moderna.  Sometimes I feel like I'm the most clear-headed one and I'm grateful for that.</p>
