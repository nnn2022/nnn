    <strong>Mask Malpractice</strong>
    <p><p>A good friend of mine called me up yesterday in tears. </p>
<p>She has an extreme anxiety problem, and sometimes sees a psychotherapist for it. She honestly cannot wear a mask because it relates to her PTSD. Today she called me and said she had to leave the session because her therapist insisted she wore a mask. She has a medical exemption (I live in a country where it's a law that literally says ''anyone that feels psychological distress'' while wearing a mask is exempt and NO doctor note is required, it's based on the honor system to assume that the person is telling the truth. No one is allowed to question it). Yet she was forced throughout the entire hour to wear a mask (SIX FEET from the therapist). She tried all she could, but after 5 minutes she broke down and had to take it off. She even offered to hold it over her face in her hand. <br>
She was thrown out, naturally feeling a thousand times worse than when she arrived. <br>
How THE HELL can a so-called mental health professional pretend to help people with their psychological problems while purposefully forcing upon them something that's an obvious anxiety trigger?! <br>
I was shocked. <br>
Just another account of how mad the world has gone.</p></p>

        <p>That’s ridiculous. Instead of making accommodations for the people who are unwilling or unable to wear masks, we should be making accommodations for the people afraid to be around maskless individuals</p>

        <p>Leave this therapist a bad review. These self righteous pieces of dog shit have no place in any mental health profession. Hold sessions from home if you don’t want to be near people, you absolute disgusting twat.</p>

        <p>This is why I won’t even bother getting therapy even though I probably need it. I don’t want to do it virtually because it would mean awkwardly walking around outside as far away from people as possible (I don’t live alone) and although I’m fortunate that masks don’t cause me distress (just anger/annoyance because I think it’s stupid) i would not pay to see a therapist while wearing one and they were wearing one. Fuck that.</p>
<p>Also given the fact that most of my psychological issues come from my opposition to all of this shit, I don’t know if I could even find a therapist who would actually listen and validate my feelings, or at least not one covered by my insurance. I’m concerned they would either try to brainwash me into being a doomer or give toxic positivity advice like “just take up knitting and bake banana bread, it’s not that bad!”</p>
<p>Anyone have an experience with an actual GOOD therapist out there? I’m sure they exist, but they’re probably booked solid.</p>

        <p>I’m a sane person with a bachelors in psychology looking to soon become a therapist. Don’t give up, you deserve proper mental health care and I’m sure the right person who agrees with you is out there. It really just depends on the individual and there’s more of us than you’d think</p>

        <p>Absolutely wrong, and I feel it shows the therapist is in the wrong profession.
I feel bad she had to go through that.</p>

        <p>Happened to me back in April. Went to a psychiatrist for help and the first thing she did was say "where is your mask?" In a very rude tone. I walked out crying then because she got a bit aggressive</p>

        <p>I know people in the same position, though fortunately they haven't encountered such gobsmackingly selfish people as this 'therapist' who frankly should be struck off. The exemption for people with PTSD is one of the last islands of humanity in this desiccated hellworld and jobsworths are the absolute last people I'd let take it. "But they're probably worried about being infected!" Then they should resign. Pfft.</p>

        <p>If you are without a mask, others should assume you are exempt. </p>
<p>Your medical information is private. </p>
<p>They shouldn’t even ask if you are exempt.</p>
<p>Stress is a valid exemption.</p>
