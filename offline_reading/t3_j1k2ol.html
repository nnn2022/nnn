    <strong>Pregnant women having to give birth wearing masks: how to counter this point</strong>
    <p><p>So according to friends of mine that are pregnant or delivered during lockdowns, as well as this sub and LDS, women have to wear a mask the entire time during delivery.  Today one of these women announced the birth of her child over the weekend, but added in that she had to wear a mask for the 14 hour labor period and that therefore no one has any reason to EVER complain about a mask. </p>
<p>I’m a woman, never given birth myself and I know without a mask it’s one of the hardest and most painful things you’ll do. So if you’re trying to advocate for not wearing masks, especially why it can be harmful, how do you counter someone who brings up the fact women are successfully delivering babies with them on?</p></p>

        <p>Yes. That's been a thing since March.</p>
<p>They were also banning fathers, and any other support partners from being in the room as well until recently, leaving these birthing mothers by themselves with the staff. </p>
<p>For safety!</p>

        <p>Yes. I know plenty of women who have been forced to wear a mask and give birth alone. They talk about how wonderful and amazing it is because it's for their safety. Babies are taken away from the mothers if there is any suspicion they have Covid. New way of giving birth, I guess.</p>

        <p>I stripped naked as soon as labor got intense. You better believe I would have stripped my mask off as well. Then again, I gave birth at home. I'm not sure how the nurses would enforce mask wearing on a woman who kept taking it off. By kicking her out of the hospital? By strapping her hands to the bed? I actually wouldn't put that past them. Anyone who can give birth at home should. Or at least at a birthing center that doesn't have barbaric rules.</p>

        <p>Everyone is different. I would say something like “my health matters” and then explain the specifics. </p>
<p>I am 39 weeks pregnant and work in a school. I was standing in class today and felt truly awful wearing a mask and needed to sit down. I was not the main teacher I was joining the class so luckily it was not too disruptive. Sitting didn’t help, but once I went out and removed my mask I felt better. </p>
<p>One persons experience doesn’t stand for all. If it doesn’t bother you that’s great it usually doesn’t bother me but when it does my health and comfort is equally as important as those who like mask virtue signaling. I think it’s a dangerous imposition to make breathing comfortably a privilege and not a right. </p>
<p>Also, I plan to take off my mask as much as possible during labor. I will be tested anyways.</p>

        <p>That’s like saying that no woman should get an epidural because other women don’t use one. I personally had out of hospital births for both so they were completely natural but if a woman wants to go to a hospital and have pain relief I don’t care. What she should feel is shame that the first thing her baby saw in the world was a mask. I had a baby a few months ago at home. I was very sick from an unknown virus and still managed to give birth in a tub with zero pain relief. That woman’s brag about labor in a mask is not impressive to me.</p>

        <p>I was actually googling “forced to give birth in a mask” the other day and got all these stories of women who labored for days in their masks and now were pissed at anyone who didn’t want to wear one for 15 minutes at Walmart. Typical propaganda. Interesting that there weren’t any women who were angry about being forced to wear one or any research on adverse effects of laboring with a mask on. Guess I’d have to search on duck duck go for that. </p>
<p>My doctor says that I’ll have to wear one in the operating room for my c-section in January but not after I get back to my room. And yes I will be pulling my mask down to kiss my baby the first time I get to hold her.</p>

        <p>How about given the situation it should be up to the woman if she wants to wear a mask. Typically I would assume you give birth in a room not shared by other patients. If it’s medical professionals worried about contracting diseases, they work with potentially infected people all day, they can wear N95s and other PPE to protect themselves. </p>
<p>I wonder if this was truly a legit medical decision or just another thing to make some people “feel safe”</p>

        <p>that sounds healthy....for the baby. NOT.</p>
<p>again wearing a mask for 1 day is different than EVERY DAY for hours on end.</p>
<p>Effect is CUMULATIVE - CO2...that's my experience.</p>

        <p>Just because someone has it worse doesn't meant others forfeit the "right" to complain about their circumstances. A poor/hungry person in America is probably better off that one in Africa, but that doesn't mean they aren't allowed to talk about how hard it is or begrudge their circumstances. I had a baby last year and I can't imagine laboring in a mask, I truly feel terrible for the women who have been forced to do that. But just because they've had that experience it doesn't invalidate others who are struggling with having to wear one every day during long shifts at work, etc.</p>
<p>That said, aside from a few very specific medical conditions, wearing a mask is <em>not</em> harmful, so I am not sure how you would be able to counter that point. Annoying and uncomfortable, sure. But for healthy people with no medical conditions that affect their ability to breathe, wearing a mask is not harmful.</p>
<p>Edit: downvoted for pointing out that wearing a mask isn't harmful, I guess? Look, ya'll can hate masks all you want and you can absolutely hold the opinion they aren't necessary or shouldn't be required. All perfectly valid. But (as aside from a few specific conditions) wearing a mask is NOT going to hurt you and it's hilarious that you'll downvote someone for pointing that out. This sub can be as bad as the coronavirus sub sometimes, downvoting anything that doesn't support their preferred narrative.</p>
