    <p><p>It's annoying. </p>
<p>What's really annoying is I know half the people posting that kind of stuff are giant hypocrites who regularly party with friends outside their household. Rules for thee but not for me. </p>
<p>Yes, I know, social media bad, stop looking at it, etc. But for those of you on it, what are you seeing?</p></p>

        <p>Seeing the same stuff. I went to a Halloween party last night though, but most of those people are no longer active on social media. There‚Äôs a complete separation between people who loaf around on social media all day and people moving on with life in reality.</p>

        <p>I have a few friends who posted photos at crowded Halloween parties with no masks or anything. These same friends were screaming at everyone to mask up and stay home whenever possible just a few days ago. One is an ICU nurse and she‚Äôs been spouting those lines for months nonstop, I was shocked she posted the Halloween photos</p>

        <p>Met up with a few friends earlier tonight, and also found some additional people to hang with who didn't wear or mention masks. Also heard about two nice-sized parties going on tonight. Myself, everyone I hung out with, and everyone attending the parties are college-aged. One person I met mentioned they were "looking for a bar that's open with all this Covid nonsense".</p>
<p>In addition, before all this, I stopped into Walmart to pick up a few things. Half the people there (mostly 50+) didn't have a mask on, and 1/3 of employees were improperly wearing their mask. After, I walked around the city center with a friend and noticed at least half of all people either didn't have a mask on or was wearing it improperly.</p>
<p>Young or old, no one cares about this virus except the people like Reddit Mask Nazis and doomers who live in their little echo chambers.</p>

        <p>Also seeing this. Seeing people post maskless party pictures when they were yelling at people to wear a mask three days ago. </p>
<p>My favorite was a tweet from one of the worst doomers saying how he was looking forward to spending Sunday unfriending and blocking everyone who posted pics of them at parties.  Fun stuff.</p>

<p>It's ironic because it's the same for the elites and rulers. These rules aren't for them to follow, they're for us. They look at us like poor, stupid animals and we get treated as such.</p>
<p>"A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky, dangerous animals, and you know it." That fact is used against us all the time.</p>

        <p>Nice to see that the drama society has shown up!</p>
<p>We had sleepovers instead and ordered pizza in. I'm sure that they will somehow power on from this crushing and totalitarian blow to their social development.</p>
<p>It was actually quite an interesting conversation with them. Yes, they were upset but they understood why because they've grown up with the idea that evidence and science are important and that you can't wish reality away with fairy tales. I consider that an important part of growing up and becoming an adult and hope that one day, you too will get there.</p>

<p>From the overarching guidance from my <a href="https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/how-to-protect-yourself-and-others-from-coronavirus-covid-19">federal government</a> to my <a href="https://www.nsw.gov.au/covid-19/how-to-protect-yourself-and-others#how-to-protect-yourself-and-others">local government's advice</a> to scientific papers that detail the impact of social distancing to my understanding of epidemiology acquired when I got my PhD.</p>

<p>Sure. <a href="https://osf.io/wdbpe/">Table 2 of this study</a>. IFR for people my age is 0.0092% and a fraction of that for my children. Then you combine that with the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188417v2">data on outdoor transmission being very rare</a>.  My kids had a blast. </p>
<p>To change my mind, I would want to see evidence showing my children were at high risk of death or serious illness from the virus (it would have to at least be many times higher than the seasonal flu). Then I would want to see evidence that outdoor transmission was an important pathway.</p>

        <p>&rt;As someone who does actually have some qualifications in this arena (a PhD in Medicine)</p>
<p>Thank you for laying out your credentials. I prefer to let my ideas and sources stand on their own. </p>
<p>Since we're specifically discussing trick-or-treating, let's delve into your understanding and the sources allegedly behind that. </p>
<p>Beginning with:</p>
<p>&rt;An understanding of the underlying principles of epidemiology, transmission vectors and the R factor of COVID-19</p>
<p>What principles of epidemiology specifically rule out outdoor candy distribution and collection? All the literature I've read on "transmission vectors" shows that poorly ventilated indoor spaces and prolonged face to face contact is key to transmission. Trick or treating does not seem conducive to that. Isn't the current "R factor" for coronavirus well below 1 in your country? That would seem to make trick or treating entirely reasonable to my mind. </p>
<p>Neither of your sources relate to trick or treating or have any particular relevance to that sort of activity. They don't even get into outdoor transmission of the virus, which is exceedingly rare.  </p>
<p>Also, how can trick or treating be too dangerous according to your "understanding of the underlying principles of epidemiology," yet you claim that </p>
<p>&rt;We had sleepovers instead and ordered pizza in.</p>
<p>Am I correct to interpret this as you having sleepovers with people from other households? If so that would be prolonged indoor exposure, which would be much more likely to transmit the virus. Somehow obtaining a pizza was safe, but getting candy to go is not...</p>

        <p>Thanks for your reply. It is refreshing to discuss this in a sensible manner rather than with people who insist that this is either a hoax or a plot for the government to control us.</p>
<p>I mention my credentials only in post script and in reference to my desire to engage on this channel, not as a direct support to my position as that would be an argument from authority fallacy.</p>
<p>Viral load is indeed a critical aspect of transmission, heighten by enclosed spaces, prolonged exposure and not taking mitigating actions like wearing a mask. Added to that is the fact that the greater number of people you are exposed to and the more you meet them means the greater likelihood of exposure and thus infection. One of the actions of the Australian population has been to limit the number of non-essential physical gatherings and I take the position that Halloween is a non-essential activity. While this is a judgement call and you make take a different position, you will note that at no point did I claim that everyone must do what I did. The sources I gave support social distancing and isolation as tools to address the pandemic. While outdoor transmission is far rarer than indoor transmission as per the paper you cite - "However risk of outdoor transmission increases when the natural social distancing of everyday life is breached, and gathering density, circulation and size increases, particularly for an extended duration."</p>
<p>The local reproduction number of corona virus in Australia is low exactly because the population have been taking protective actions, not because the virus has a low R value. If we continue to take these precautions then we will soon be out of this situation and be able to get back to normal and open up. With zero active cases, New Zealand has taken this approach and they have opened up completely. It was amazing to see a recent rugby game with a fully packed crowd.</p>
<p>&rt; Am I correct to interpret this as you having sleepovers with people from other households? If so that would be prolonged indoor exposure, which would be much more likely to transmit the virus. Somehow obtaining a pizza was safe, but getting candy to go is not..</p>
<p>If these were random strangers then your point would hold but this was with school friends who they spend 8 hours a day with 5 days a week so not increasing their practical exposure.</p>

<p>Ohhhhh so you had people from other households spend the night, but outdoor trick or treating was deemed unsafe. The virus makes no distinction for strangers or friends.</p>
<p>You said your actions were based on</p>
<p>&rt;having read studies demonstrating the impact of social distancing. </p>
<p>Yet somehow having people stay over at your house is ok. Even the study you linked to states:</p>
<p>&rt;In multiple conditional logistic regression analysis of contact types, <strong>household contact</strong> (OR 6¬∑3; 95% CI 1¬∑5‚Äì26¬∑3) and travelling together (OR 7¬∑1; 1¬∑4‚Äì34¬∑9) were significantly associated with infection</p>
