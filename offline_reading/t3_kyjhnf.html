    <strong>It’s interesting to me that the public still thinks politicians care about them</strong>
    <p><p>Disclaimer: US-centric. I don’t know about politicians in other countries and if the rhetoric is similar. </p>
<p>So we all know we’re getting a new president this week. I was reading Facebook comments yesterday and saw someone who is clearly an adult and old enough to know better say something like “Finally, someone who cares about us will be in office!” The rhetoric is similar among Biden-Harris supporters. They CARE about COVID. They CARE about the people. If Hillary were president she would have controlled COVID and cared about us. </p>
<p>After watching the last stimulus bickering, why would anyone (especially any adult) think any politician cares about them? Do you think Pelosi really cares about you when she showed off her fancy ice cream freezer when millions were out of work and couldn’t get through to their state unemployment systems? Do you think that every politician who tells you to stay home and avoid your family then takes a lavish vacation themselves or throws an unmasked dinner party really cares about you? Joe Biden more than likely does not know who you are. You’re not his friend. You’ve never met him. He and Kamala and every other politician has an agenda to push. As soon as it does not benefit them, your interests are pushed aside so they can get on their next order of business. </p>
<p>I see it in PA too. “Tom Wolf is saving lives! We could be like Florida without him!” “Wolf wants to keep everyone safe.” Residents of my state seem to believe the same thing. Wolf cares about them personally, but reality is, like he would even know their name if he walked by them on the street. He knows if he didn’t have restrictions the media would shred him like they do to DeSantis, Noem and Kemp and he wants to look good. He needs to be seen as trying to “slow the spread.” </p>
<p>Look around. Do you think Cuomo and Lightfoot are now saying it’s time to reopen because they gained so much sympathy overnight for shuttered restaurants, lost jobs and high unemployment? It’s more likely that they saw figures and statistics that Karen on Facebook doesn’t have access to and realized their states and cities are extremely far in the hole. It’s also more likely that now that the Democrats have control of everything in DC that they want to look like saviors in 2022. In NJ, Phil Murphy is running again for governor. I can almost predict with certainty that he’ll be trying to open NJ as soon as he can so he can look good for his election.</p>
<p>And that’s just it. As soon as more politicians see that further restrictions and closures will no longer benefit their vision, they will open regardless of “cases.” Do you really think they’ll go “oh geez, poor Jane in Randomtown PA is still afraid to go grocery shopping. I guess we’d better keep things closed.” Or “Wow, look at all these people on Reddit who still only see their family from 10 feet away with masks. Look how caring they are! I won’t let anyone else do anything either just so I can beg them to be like RedditDoomer365.” No. They won’t care about your feelings or your inability to go to a store anymore. They’ll leave you to figure it out and take your own precautions as society reopens. </p>
<p>Right now, governors and Biden can at least point to CASES and HOSPITALIZATIONS as reasons to keep everyone hysterical. But the second they can’t or need to push a new agenda item, the crisis will end and the doomers who think those politicians love them so much will be left to navigate for themselves. Stop thinking they care about you.</p></p>

        <p>The narrative is laid out in such frequency, intensity that they have been brainwashed into thinking that: 1) masks work, 2) the vaccine is safe, 3) Politicians care about them, 4) the tests are needed and are accurate, 5) only with masks, social distancing and with vaccines can we return back to 'normal'</p>

        <p>Anyone in the US who thinks that the likes of Nancy Pelosi and company are here for you... watch this video of a heated exchange between her and Wolf Blitzer of CNN who actually takes her to the mat for blocking Trump's 1.8 trillion dollar stimulus package proposed back in OCTOBER and tell me this woman is looking out for YOU and not herself and her party's own best interests: </p>

        <p>Let me tell you guys the exact moment I 100% realized that politicians had no clue what life was like for us plebes. </p>
<p>I worked at a company whose owners wife had been a city councilwoman for 15 years.  She had decided not to run and was pretty much looking for something to do.  Now they were rich.  Running off to Europe was nothing to them.  They did it a couple times a year.  </p>
<p>I mentioned that I'd like to go to France some day and follow where my grandfather went in WWII.  She said 'well just do it.  We pay you enough you should be able to swing that easy'.  </p>
<p>Really?  Sure I was making 70k a year.  That's great.  Now let's look at the bills.  Mortgage, two cars, my kid, three step kids, a wife that if she 'worked' didn't contribute to the household income at all.  Now how EXACTLY am I supposed to be able to just jet off to Europe like i was visiting a club in the next city over. </p>
<p>It was at that exact moment it became clear to me.  They don't understand us because they don't know the real day to day struggles we face.  Paying their bills, if they even pay them or can afford to pay someone to pay them for them, is a concept totally foreign to them.  They think that money is just something that comes out of the air because they deserve it.  But we should 'earn' it because we're not as 'good' as they are.  So to them we are a bunch of poor little simpletons that need to be directed so we don't bump our noses on the wall. </p>
<p>Jokes on them though.  My consulting company pays me way more than they did.  And I only have to work about an hour a day average.  I grabbed a retail job that I love just to stay fit and socialized instead of getting fat and bored.  </p>
<p>Personally it is a dream of mine that nobody at or above city council person should have a yearly income of more than $55,000.  Let the people who know what the struggle is be the ones that make the 'rules'.  They'd be way more realistic and since we're such a simple bunch they'd be much simpler as well.</p>

        <p>Because that is politicians' bread and butter. What else do they exist to do but run on gaining people's votes by promising whichever group they are appealing to that they care about their ideals.</p>
<p>Enter the capitol protests and now it's a straight up media narrative and talking point to love politicians because they are our earthly representatives of holy order and democracy. Not to mention the last year of leaders worldwide overstepping their bounds in the name of what is "right."</p>
<p>I remember the mid-2000s when the only less trusted organization in America than congress was Comcast.</p>

        <p>How can anyone say politicians care about them and want government to take care of them after hearing Pelosi say she agreed to the latest stimulus deal because Biden is in office now. She refused to accept Trump’s deal for months. That way they can blame Trump for the failing economy and high unemployment and then praise Biden for saving everyone. Bring him in as our savior riding on a white horse. It’s repulsive honestly.</p>

        <p>Yep. So many people complain about such and such Congressman hasn’t done anything, then go right out and vote for Do-Nothing Congressman because he has the name they recognize.</p>

        <p>Yeah, very few politicians care about us, except perhaps a local politician whom we happen to know. Doesn't matter what party it is.</p>

        <p>The real conspiracy going around is that politicians actually care about people. If they did, there wouldn't be the hypocrisy, they'd care about the damage caused by restrictions and try other options, they wouldn't shame their people for asking questions. Those are just examples from this year, but really, they wouldn't be earning as much money as possible while leaving others to starve, they would do genuinely what's best for the people. The list continues, but it's so obvious that they never cared about us.</p>

        <p>Politicians should be paid by citizens only based on donations, no corporate donations. If you suck you go broke, if you are good you stay in office.</p>
