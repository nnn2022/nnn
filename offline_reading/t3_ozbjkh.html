        <p>No it is not racism in disguise. Don't turn this to fucking identity politics. All races are affected by this. The fact that a majority of black or other races might be more proportionally affected by this is just collateral damage for these authoritarians.</p>

        <p>I agree with you - the vaccine passports are an authoritarian powergrab that will see our society segregated and destroyed like like nothing else in the past - wait, like one thing in the past. </p>
<p>Since racial segregation is the best example of the two-tiered access to society that we have, it makes sense to compare the vaccine passports to that system. Especially since we've all agreed (in America, that is - I'm not sure where you're posting from, so you might have different values regarding freedom of self-determination than I do) at this point that segregation by race is wrong. These images might just wake normal, non-involved people up to the hypocrisy of their actions vs their words.</p>

        <p>Yes it is like segregation which was racist and based on race. But this is not a race based segregation and it is not done with a racist mindset. We can compare it to racial segregation without claiming it is racial segregation or that racial segregation is it's primary intent.</p>

        <p>This is just a lie. POC don't make up a majority of unvaccinated. It's per population percentage, and yes POC are less vaccinated by percentage of their population. Our argument can win without distorting the message into a lie.</p>

        <p>No, what they are trying to explain is that Vaccine ID is like Voter ID.  It disproportionately affects minorities and people of color and is a form of racial segregation, and like voter ID, it is more difficult for minorities, people of color, and low income people to get vaccines and vaccine IDs.  Whites have much higher vaccination rates, and minorities have significantly lower vaccination rates.  That's white privilege in action right there.</p>
<p><em>"As of August 2, 2021, CDC reported that race/ethnicity was known for 58% of people who had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Among this group, nearly two thirds were White (59%), 10% were Black, 16% were Hispanic, 6% were Asian, 1% were American Indian or Alaska Native, and &lt;1% were Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, while 8% reported multiple or other race.</em>"  </p>

        <p>It's not talking about the vaccine itself being racist, it's illustrating how a side effect of the 'Vaccine Passports' being rolled out will inevitably be racial discrimination in cities where it's implemented. </p>
<p>Similar to how 'Stop and Frisk' allowed police to blatantly discriminate due to racial violence statistics, 'Vaccine Passports' will allow police to discriminate, harass, and bar entry to people of color due to the fact that only 28% or so of the black population is vaccinated at the time these policies go in place. Or how public drinking laws in NYC were rarely (if ever) applied to white populations drinking in parks during 'picnics' and were mainly enforced against people of color drinking on their porches. There are many more examples of these laws being abused by the police force to racially target and discriminate - I'm sure you're as aware of this as we all are after BLM helped educate us about these facts over the last year.</p>

        <p>y'know where vaccine passports are going to be used?</p>
<p>at doctors, at goverment buildings, and at work. There is not going to be a police officer at every coffee shop and wendys, there not going to stop people in the street, only at high risk places (especially hospitals). And if someone is going to the doctors, government buildings, or a workplace that could require the vaccine they will have access to a card</p>

<p>i never said anything about separate but equal, what im saying is that these vaccine cards are not going to be used nearly as much as people are saying, and that for most people it wont affect you. i dont care what race or privilege you dont have, you dont have a vaccine, you dont go near the immunocomprised</p>

<p>I value innocent human life more than racism, good people are dying and some people have the fucking nerve to say 'b b but i cant go to walmart bc the system is against me and i cant get vaccinated'. if you want to get the system in your favor then start putting other peoples lives before your inconveniences</p>

        <p>Not to be rude, but do you ever think twice before you write something?</p>
<p>&rt;if i have to mandate the stupid fucks who wont take the vaccine because 'its a violation of my freedoms' with vaccine cards to get it done then so be it.</p>
<p>This is not a very good perspective to have, and it reminds me so much of a very significant person in history, who said:</p>
<p><em>"The great strength of the totalitarian state is that it forces those who fear it to imitate it.”</em></p>
<p>And your timing is pristine as well because <a href="https://www.bunte.de/family/leben/haertere-regeln-ab-herbst-was-sich-jetzt-beim-einkaufen-im-kino-und-beim-friseur-aendert.html">Germany just implemented a mandate demanding vaccination certificates</a> or pcr tests to go pretty much anywhere, including if you want to buy food in a grocerie store. You would fit right in.</p>
<p>&rt;if you want to get the system in your favor then start putting other peoples lives before your inconveniences</p>
<p>Why would I want a fucking fraudulent, immoral and unsustainable system in my favor? You must be either a politician or very young.</p>

        <p>You say that now, wait til they actually implement them everywhere.</p>
<p>You really think it'll just be "government buildings"? Other countries are already making it impossible to go grocery shopping without the vaccine ID.</p>
<p>"Give them an inch, and they'll take a mile", and best believe they'll do it too.</p>
