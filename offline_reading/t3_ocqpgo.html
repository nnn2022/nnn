    <strong>Making Sense of What Doesn't Make Sense</strong>
    <p><p>I would like whomever is reading my thread to pause for a moment and reason this out.
If a female friend told you that her partner 
~was tracking her movements
~ wouldn't let her attend school or work (Note: couples who agree to the woman staying at home with the kids and being free to change her mind in the future do not fall into this category)
~ would not allow her to leave the house unless he deemed it essential
~ would not allow her to visit friends or family 
~ demands that she cover her face when she leaves the house and refrain from going within six feet of others
~ controls which news sources she may read/watch
~ monitors her social media activity for "false information "
~ punishes her if she resists his demands</p>
<p>What would you call it?
When the government does it, why is it any less reprehensible?</p>
<p>If the COVID-19 vaccine is allegedly so wonderful, why the pressure campaign to induce acceptance? I am talking about advertisements for vaccine clinics online, on storefronts, and even on parked vehicles. Messages on public transit vehicles are advertising it as "safe" and playing on one's sense of social responsibility. I have seen local government workers canvassing neighborhoods trying to get people signed up and even approaching shoppers as they enter supermarkets. Employers and retailers are offering gift cards as incentives for getting jabbed. 
I have even heard of a lottery only for vaccinated people. Tell me that doesn't create pressure!</p>
<p>When the default position is to presume people infectious without a shred of concrete evidence (the asymptomatic transmission fallacy), it thrusts an impossible burden of proof upon their shoulders. A negative cannot logically be proven. It is the public health equivalent of  "guilty until proven innocent." Going about one's daily life becomes an ordeal of fear, which paralyzes the normal decision-making process.
Name me any instance where you would go to your doctor telling him/her that you know you are sick, yet can't name any symptoms when asked.</p>
<p>Allowing only the vaccinated to forego face coverings creates an apartheid giving one group the lion's share of rights while making outcasts of the other.  Is discrimination based on acceptance or rejection of an experimental therapy any less heinous than the racial discrimination of the pre- Civil Rights Era (USA)? </p>
<p>One form of hypocrisy that really burns me up is seeing a parent walk around maskless in public while demanding that their children continue to cover their faces. </p>
<p>Why the withholding of  information that the individual needs to make a truly reasoned decision? If full disclosure doesn't scare someone out of taking the vaccine, it's their body and they have the freedom to make that choice; conversely, nobody has the right to deceive them into submitting against conviction of conscience through deliberate lies of omission. To persuade without knowing the risks is negligent and irresponsible; to persuade with full knowledge of the risks is monstrous. 
A doctor who failed to notify a patient (or his guardian in the case of a minor) of the risks incurred by a drug or surgery would easily find himself facing a malpractice suit should harm result. Perhaps the patient would have chosen not to consent had the risk been known. 
When your rights are natural (inherent merely by virtue of being  human), then no government, no other individual has the power to grant them, because what they can bestow, they can also take away. 
Thoughts, anyone ?</p></p>

        <p>Have you seen the people walking around our country nowadays? It is so incredibly rare to find a critical thinker with courage. You must have both. Can't just have courage or critical thinking. Need both. No one lives by principles. Everyone is scared. I think it starts at a young age. We need to teach kids to question everything and to THINK.</p>

        <p>Very well put. It's not just being smart. It's something else--courage or spiritedness.</p>
<p>Thank you both for your comments. I too am driven mad by the sight of unmasked, vaxed parents forcing their often quite young children to wear those awful muzzles. It's sickening.</p>

        <p>Critical thinkers with courage are exactly what the ruling elite do not want! The fact there are so few is no accident. It was meticulously planned and implemented over decades so no one could see the cultural rot.</p>

        <p>&rt;We need to teach kids to question everything and to THINK.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that means kids need to be removed from "normal" school, but to do so you'd need to have a parent, or a tribe of like minded, available 24/7 to help them along. </p>
<p>And said parent/tribe needs to be ready and willing to accept that the child will challenge them, challenge their way of thinking, and even their way of life.</p>
<p>Most parents would be willing to do the first part, but sooner or later the child will no longer accept what they are being told and that is when the idea of "It's okay to question everything, unless it is me" starts to show itself.</p>

        <p>This!!!!
I was in a relationship with a comorbid BPD/NPD. The one thing that made everything sink in and ground me was to fully understand gaslighting. That someone you love and trust can look you dead in the eyes, and lie to you. </p>
<p>Also, the common techniques used by abusive people are fairly consistent. Our government and media use these same tactics.</p>
<p>It lead me down a path of research for about a year. I feel it mentally prepared me for our current political environment.</p>

        <p>Yes once you see the pattern you see it everywhere. Family. Friends. Employers. The government. 99% of people are either a narcissist/psychopath or a codependent enabler. I’m starting to realize that COVID was the likely reason I went through all this hell for so many years. Abusive parents, abusive ex, debilitating health problems that had no name and no solution and forced me to look behind the curtain of western medicine....it all prepared me for COVID. Not sure what’s going to happen next but I’m ready.</p>

        <p>It's also abuse when our elderly, under the guise of  "protection, " are denied in person contact with family and forced to live out their remaining days deprived of human touch, hurtled into a downward spiral of depression. Chronic stress  and depression deplete the immune system; human connection and self-care enhance it.
When despotic rogue governors, drunk on the power of "emergency orders," mandate that nursing homes admit COVID-19 positive patients, it is like lighting a match to dry wood. It is elder genocide. I know personally of adults who were deprived  of visiting parents or spouse, only to learn that their death was ruled COVID-19. 
I have known of elderly who have been denied personal contact unless they agree to the COVID-19 vaccine, forced to settle for visits separated by a pane of glass as though prisoners. This is despicable exploitation of a vulnerable person.</p>
