        <p>This was my reply before getting banned and I couldn't post it lol </p>
<p>"How are those numbers accurate without proper testing? The testing rate for corona is RIDICULOUSLY high so naturally you're gonna have more positives. </p>
<p>Think about it this way. How much more likely are you to get In a wreck if you drive every day vs once a year? </p>
<p>More testing=higher positives. </p>
<p>Plus you got people dying in car accidents or dying of underlying conditions or just OLD people dying of age, and these are all being counted as corona deaths. </p>
<p>So yeah. No one gave a fuck about it back then but now it's all about painting red as enemies blue as saviors and controlling everyone and implementing socialism. Govt doesn't give a shit about people, or saving them. It's all about narratives, power, and control. And Biden is a puppet, ... You'd think they would at least pick a puppet who could utter a coherent thought or finish a sentence. </p>
<p>Let's hear all the amazing things Biden did while former VP? </p>
<p>And I don't know what that last bit has to do with anything lol I never said anything about president of the entire world"</p>
