    <strong>A Plea For Positivity</strong>
    <p><p>This is a post suggesting positive energy is the way forward. Read on if you are interested. </p>
<p>Since March-April of 2020, the end goal for the pandemic has become increasingly clear. </p>
<p>Okay:<br>
- At first, I was <strong>excited</strong>: Finally, a global event to shake up the mundane, robotic patterns of the system. <br>
- Then, I was <strong>happy</strong> for a little while. No more early mornings or crowded trains.<br>
- But then, I became <strong>bored.</strong> The novelty of a global pandemic had worn off. <br>
- I was also becoming a <strong>self-bargainer.</strong> Vaccines were the hot topic, but there weren't any at the time, which meant at least another six months of freedom. <br>
- Then, I became <strong>nervous.</strong> I had a gut feeling that things were WORSE than I'd thought.<br>
-  I was consumed by a very real <strong>existential concern</strong>. I found myself unable to completely enjoy a day or moment.  Everything was a matter of "enjoy it while it lasts". In the back of my mind, there were two intermingling yet oppositional fears: a fear <strong><em>of</em></strong> the future and a fear of <strong><em>no future</em></strong>.<br>
- Such a thing left me feeling <strong>hopeless</strong>. " There <strong><em>is</em></strong> no future: this is it - the end. "  --  I felt as if all the dreams and goals I'd set my heart on would be impossibilities in the "New World Order", and that I would have to settle for humbler goals, like basic survival.  <br>
- Despair turned to <strong>anger</strong>. I ridiculed the people and the propaganda non-stop. I'm embarrassed of many of the things I've said. <br>
- Now, the anger is rapidly fading. I am settling on hope, and am asking you to do the same. </p>
<p>I believe in psychological manifestation. I'm talking about the connection between mental energy and reality. You might not believe in that stuff. It's an alternative viewpoint but I stand by it. When you realise all matter is just electromagnetic energy condensed to a slow vibration, in tandem with the fact the human brain emits electromagnetic waves, the marriage of the physical and the mental become a lot more scientifically + spiritually plausible. </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;  Quick anecdote: In <strong>Ghostbusters 2</strong> , New York battles with a pink "psycho" slime that becomes positively/negatively charged based on its social interaction with people. Spoiler alert, New York is filled with so much negative energy, the slime becomes a giant fortress in which "the season is evil is born the New Year".  &rt;&rt;</p>
<p>Anyways, I hear a lot of hopelessness these days from allies; family members, people on NNN. Hearing so much of it made me forfeit mine. I'm not going to give up on my dreams. I'm not going to give up on the premise of a re-imagined future. I'm also not going to celebrate illness as a result of a) a virus or b) a vaccine because I shouldn't be celebrating death. This is outmoded human behaviour. A population cull of any magnitude means the death of good doctors, good teachers, good police officers, good dentists,  poets, dreamers, artists, handymen, horticulturalists.</p>
<p>Even on NNN, we have fallen into the trap: Divide and Conquer. The way things are going, violence is sure to break out among civilians if people keep charging themselves with negative emotions. Seeing seas of people chanting and holding flags protesting for their freedom brings real tears to my eyes. Seeing police stand down and join protestors is like seeing a crack of light in a dark room. These are UNDERRATED, and BEAUTIFUL historical images. They are significant. They show us the clay is still wet; the future has not been formed. Of course the rich and  powerful want us to think it has - it makes us feel weak, isolated and miserable. </p>
<p>But if we surrender, assuming we're doomed, we stand no chance.  Chin up<br>
This sub is going up 1k every 1-2 days. Something brilliant could be happening. If there's a "great awakening", it can't happen without a catalyst.</p></p>

        <p>YES thank you! I love this. The gates of hell even say "Abandon all hope here". Our emotional vibrations have an effect on reality. Try to keep yours high :) Love is the highest vibration while fear is the lowest.</p>

        <p>&rt;Colonel – Marine! What is that button on your body armor?</p>
<p>&rt;Private Joker – A Peace Symbol Sir!</p>
<p>&rt;Colonel – Where’d you get it?</p>
<p>&rt;Private Joker – I don’t remember Sir!</p>
<p>&rt;Colonel – What is that you’ve got written on your helmet?</p>
<p>&rt;Private Joker – Born To Kill, Sir!</p>
<p>&rt;Colonel – You write “Born to Kill” on your helmet and you wear a Peace Button? What’s that supposed to be? Some kind of sick joke?</p>
<p>&rt;Private Joker – No Sir!</p>
<p>&rt;Colonel – What is it supposed to mean?</p>
<p>&rt;Private Joker – I don’t know Sir!</p>
<p>&rt;Colonel – You don’t know very much, do ya?</p>
<p>&rt;Private Joker – No Sir!</p>
<p>&rt;Colonel – You better get your head and your ass together or I will take a giant shit on ya!</p>
<p>&rt;Private Joker – Yes Sir</p>
<p>&rt;Colonel – Now answer my question or you’ll be standing tall before the “Man”!</p>
<p>&rt;Private Joker – I think I was suggesting about the duality of “Man”, Sir!</p>
<p>&rt;Colonel – Do what?</p>
<p>&rt;Private Joker – The duality of man. The Jungian thing Sir!</p>
<p>I guess the moral of the story is: The duality of man is nice, but remember that you need to be born to kill if you are going to survive.</p>
