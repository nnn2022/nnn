        <p>That's amazing. Thank you. I like how the rich Pelosi lady had an exempt badge and everyone wearing a mask has a compliant badge. Also, I wish the gimps would start rioting. I guess their point is that we're all Pelosi's little gimps now.</p>

        <p>You guess?? The "symbolism" in this video couldn't be any more obvious but I guess they had to make it that way because they know their mouth-breathing fanbase wouldn't pick up on the message otherwise.</p>

        <p>Just watched it. Guy masking up made me cringe.</p>
<p>According to the guitarist:</p>
<p>"America is a beautiful idea that draws immigrants like myself from all over the world to the promised land of equality, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This idea is now under siege and certain events are starting to remind me of the things many of us came here to escape. It’s not a 'left against right' problem but an evolutionary problem. The growing pains of a civilization that without the necessary spiritual enlightenment, arrived a bit early to a level of technology where everyone is connected. The good news is that now everyone has a voice. The bad news is that now everyone has a voice. So we are living in the manipulators’ paradise, where liars and hypocrites run unscathed, the news are just opinions, politics are a blood sport, and facts are determined by consensus instead of the truth. We as artists, however, have a unique opportunity to portray and ridicule the absurd to prevent it from becoming reality."</p>
<p>That said, they also sell masks on their merch store. Gotta cover their ass, I suppose; might as well make some money while they're at it. To be honest, I've considered it. I can't work outside the home, need to stay here and babysit my mother-in-law, so maybe I could contribute to household finances by selling masks. They should't be mandatory, but they shouldn't be banned either. Simply a personal choice.</p>

        <p>I'm lib-center and happily married, far from being an incel. And I may be biased, because most domestic abusers I've met are other women, so I tend to wonder what the wife did to push her husband over the edge. Aaannd I'm aware they sell masks, you would know that if you could read a little better. Supporting personal choice and selling band masks that allow at least <em>some</em> freedom of expression - which, as you point out, are expensive enough to perhaps deter buying them - is a bit different than everyone wearing identical blue surgical masks under threat of force or coercion. I personally don't believe they should enable this mass hysteria at all, but it is quite bold to release a song so blatantly critical of our current situation.</p>

        <p>It's not bold at all. Any Fox News nut will spew off about that horseshit and get the herd going in seconds (like this subreddit) and Five Finger now have an entire decade of releasing surface level drivel in their lyrics and instrumentation. There's a reason they're a joke, and so are their fans. The constant fellating of the military, faux-intellectual anti-government lyrics that make Dave Mustaine look intelligent, the hyper-macho beat-your-chest (and wife, I guess) posturing, and all of that in addition to the horrendous production, instrumentation, and lack of creativity. They reuse their own riffs constantly, always rehash the same lyrical themes (military, anti-government without any nuance or bite, "YOU'RE BEING DECEIVED MAAAN", fuck the haters despite being in my 40s, boo hoo girl left me women bad) and are almost universally hated among anyone at or above a 3rd grade reading level. Sorry you didn't make that cut. </p>
<p>The reason I'm stirring the pot and being a prick here is because you people are honestly disgusting, and that would bother me more if all the responses weren't so ridiculously hyperbolic. I'm not in a huge hurry to let "the weak/old" just die for my convenience. Do I think a mask is going to full-proof protect me or other people? No, but I can try. It's better than nothing, and a minor inconvenience is better than showing how wantonly careless and callous towards you are, all in the name of "personal liberty". No one is twisting your arm to wear a mask, but nice job on just being a selfish person. A global pandemic with a deadly airborne disease happens and the sentiment isn't "what can we do to help" but is instead "this affects me negatively so I don't like it". This doesn't just apply to you specifically, but to everyone that blew my inbox up (shoutout to the kid that threatened to beat my ass) about this. These kinds of communities are not just stupid (and boy, are you), you are bad people. You don't care about other people, think in the broadest and most ridiculous terms, and lack self-awareness. You should be ridiculed and the hate put a smile on my face during a shitty day. So go ahead and ban me from this sub because nothing you rancid cunts say can touch me. We don't speak the same language and I'd be ashamed to breathe your air. </p>
<p>And did you really just act as a DV apologist? Yikes. Sorry for your wife.</p>

        <p>If "DV apologist" is what you call someone who questions domestic violence claims. And I'm the wife, if you couldn't infer that from the "other women" part of my previous comment.</p>
<p>Humans didn't evolve to live through chronic/terminal illness or old age. While I don't advocate systematically executing the infirm or elderly, I believe aggressive medical intervention and overreaching "public safety" measures are inhumane, prioritizing number of years lived over the quality of those years. Pneumonia has been called "friend to the elderly" because a relatively quick death from respiratory infection is often considered less cruel than a slow death over years or decades as the body and mind deteriorate. If supporting a fulfilling life and dignified death makes me a bad person, so be it.</p>
<p>Humans also didn't evolve to give a fuck about millions of others. We're pack animals, not hive animals. Any "compassion" we feel for total strangers the world over is a thin, hollow, shallow abstract compared to the genuine compassion we feel for our close social contacts. Anyone who says otherwise is most likely dishonest or delusional. Maybe both. Collectivists like you are infected by a paradoxical hysteria that will result in your destruction through the loss of cultural diversity and diversity of thought that allows some humans to adapt and survive even as others die. Whether this is from resource surplus, urban overcrowding, or simply a senescent society, you people aren't necessarily bad or stupid. Just deeply unwell on such a profound level.</p>
<p>And I had a college reading level by the time of 3rd grade, not that it's any of your business.</p>
