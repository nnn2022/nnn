        <p>Probably the largest wealth transfer we have ever seen in our lifetimes.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="http://canadabeyond150.ca/magazine/an-access-economy-that-works-for-everyone/">http://canadabeyond150.ca/magazine/an-access-economy-that-works-for-everyone/</a><br>

&rt;Access to services could displace ownership.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Canadians increasingly use digital technologies to access “solutions” rather than own assets. This emerging “access economy” could result in lower rates of ownership, particularly of high-end goods like homes and cars. Less ownership might mean more liquid capital, less debt, and access to higher quality products on demand. But less ownership could also mean that Canadians would lack collateral to secure affordable credit to invest in education and sources of passive income.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Reputational or social credit may become a more powerful determinant of socio-economic inclusion.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is becoming commonplace to rate a user’s credibility/trust (social credit), as is currently done by Uber, eBay, and others. At the same time, new technologies like blockchain support methods of capturing and assessing more information. Together, these developments could lead to new ways of evaluating who qualifies for credit and services, based on complex algorithms and much more information. By 2030, government and citizens may need to address new forms of vulnerability and inequality that result from how social behaviour is judged in reputational systems.</p>

&rt;Welcome To 2030: I Own Nothing, Have No Privacy And Life Has Never Been Better<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Welcome to the year 2030. Welcome to my city - or should I say, "our city." I don't own anything. I don't own a car. I don't own a house. I don't own any appliances or any clothes.</p>

&rt;1.4 By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance</p>

&rt;“Once in a while, I will choose to cook for myself,” she writes. “It is easy – the necessary kitchen equipment is delivered at my door within minutes… Why keep a pasta-maker and a crepe cooker crammed into our cupboards? We can just order them when we need them.”</p>
<p>Don't worry guys, there is no agenda being pushed here, do not believe in these silly conspiracy theories, us, the fact checkers, the repeaters of your truth said so.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-wef-idUSKBN2AP2T0">https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-wef-idUSKBN2AP2T0</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The WEF does not have a ‘stated goal’ to remove everyone’s private property by 2030. As addressed in previous Reuters fact checks, these claims likely originated from a WEF social media video from 2016 that stated eight predictions about the world in 2030, including: “You’ll own nothing. And you’ll be happy. What you want you’ll rent, and it’ll be delivered by drone.” (here)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Danish politician Ida Auken, who wrote the prediction in question (here), said it was not a “utopia or dream of the future” but “a scenario showing where we could be heading - for better and for worse.”</p>
<p>They will steal all the wealth, they already have most of it. And why, what the frack do they need all this money for? I will never be able to wrap my head around it. But that is human greed in a nutshell isnt it.</p>
<p>I have no hope that humanity will ever fulfill its purpose with rich old fool's who think they know what is best for the rest of us at the helm.</p>
<p>They make the problem, and then give you the solution.</p>
