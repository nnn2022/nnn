        <p>And while the main cause of death was bacterial pneumonia, the pneumonia was a result of having the flu:</p>
<p>“The majority of deaths during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 were not caused by the influenza virus acting alone, report researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, most victims succumbed to bacterial pneumonia following influenza virus infection. The pneumonia was caused when bacteria that normally inhabit the nose and throat invaded the lungs along a pathway created when the virus destroyed the cells that line the bronchial tubes and lungs.”</p>

        <p>There was always bacterial pneumonia, there was just an uptick in it being a cause of death in that timeline because it was made possible to be a more likely cause of death due to an easier pathway of travel to the lungs.</p>

        <p>I understand your point. But, with no Spanish flu there’s no bacterial pneumonia deaths at that scale. The correlation of people having the Spanish flu and then immediately getting bacterial pneumonia as a result of pathways created by the Spanish Flu virus they just recovered from was high. There’s no spike in bacterial pneumonia that I’m aware of now to compare it to, and mask hygiene is non existent. According to your hypothesis, we should be seeing a spike in bacterial pneumonia deaths in survivors of Covid 19. There is no such correlation to my knowledge.</p>

        <p>How do you know your name is really your name? Maybe they categorized it as something else? Maybe what I think Tasty Wheat tasted like actually tasted like what you think is oatmeal, or tuna fish. That makes you wonder about a lot of things. You take Covid, for example: maybe they couldn't figure out what to make Covid deaths categorized look like, which is why all deaths are categorized as Covid deaths. What I’m saying is, with no data to crunch, you can run those questions into circles all day long.</p>

        <p>Because bacterial pneumonia is different than viral. It’s actually worse, and would bring different symptoms. It also requires different treatment. Antibiotics for bacterial vs Antivirals for viruses. If you think “what if they treated both as they should’ve and marked it down as just Covid treated?” At which point I can only say that then we would have to ask people blind study what they were prescribed as treatment that worked, and compare the numbers and split them into “treated with antibiotics” and “treated with antivirals” and then compare which was more prominent. This would give us the best idea of whether bacterial pneumonia from tyrannical government overreach resulting in mandated mask wearing, or from having Covid 19 thanks to China was the reason for their sickness.</p>

        <p>While I fully agree and understand that,droplet infection isn’t the main transmission of this virus...every breath anyone exhales is an aerosol and can hang in the air for hours...aerosols readily spread viruses! The aerosols hanging in the air are readily absorbed through the eyes and mucous membranes. The masks do nothing to stop or even slow aerosols. What you’re saying IS accurate,which is why the long-standing recommended use of masks was for people who were exhibiting symptoms...coughing and sneezing. Problem is that EVERYONE breathes...if you see people’s glasses fogging up,that’s their mask...NOT working for aerosol transmission prevention.</p>
<p>People are wearing the least effective mask improperly to prevent the spread of a virus that is being exhaled in aerosols that masks don’t stop...see what I mean?</p>

        <p>They help stop droplets, which carry the virus. Less droplets are expelled when coughing/talking/breathing while wearing a mask. Less droplets leaving your body equate to less chances of infection for those who encounter you. I’m curious as to how you think masks don’t work again?</p>

        <p>When you breathe,you exhale aerosols. Aerosols remain suspended in the open air for hours and are readily absorbed by the eyes and mucous membranes. The aerosols carry huge amounts of virus and the masks do NOTHING to prevent it.</p>
<p>Masks only work to the extent that someone wearing it is coughing or sneezing.</p>

&rt; The failure of the
mask was a source of disappointment, for
the first experiment in San Francisco was
watched with interest with the expectation that if it proved feasible to enforce
the regulation the desired result would be
achieved. The reverse proved true. The
masks, contrary to expectation, were
worn cheerfully and universally, and also,
contrary to expectation of what should
follow under such circumstances, no effect
on the epidemic curve was to be seen.
Something was plainly wrong with our
hypotheses.</p>

        <p>Lmao flu “disappeared” because it was diagnosed as Covid...identical symptoms,with the only difference being that hospitals receive $13k for every diagnosis of Covid and $35k for every hospitalization...the flu doesn’t come with guaranteed government income,so it “disappeared”.</p>
<p>It’s a known fact that masks do not stop the spread of influenza...therefore they don’t stop the spread of Covid either. I posted numerous real scientific studies by actual doctors.</p>

        <p>Out of the 4 links you gave, only this one is to a scientific study instead of a news article and if you read the abstract, it says absolutely nothing about viral infection - it's about poor quality masks used in developing countries to shield you from pollution.</p>

        <p>What is a gaiter or a cheap paper mask or a bandanna if not a “poor quality mask”? The point is that literally NOBODY is wearing a properly designed nor certified mask to prevent viruses from being spread...NOBODY is wearing them properly not that it matters! If nobody is wearing and effective mask and they aren’t wearing them properly then they ARE ineffective!</p>
