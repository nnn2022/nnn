    <strong>How do you stay strong?</strong>
    <p><p>There are all sorts of pressures out there - political, media, family and more - all trying to get you to submit to this vaccine in spite of the things you know to be true. And I've seen a number of posts from people who relented and regretted it. </p>
<p>Question: How do you stay strong?</p>
<p>One thing that helps me is finding a personal anthem, sort of like a mantra I guess. Mine is a song from Kansas called Can I Tell You. The lyrics are simple but powerful:</p>
<p>Can I tell you something<br>
 Got to tell you one thing<br>
 If you expect the freedom<br>
 That you say is yours<br>
 Prove that you deserve it<br>
 Help us to preserve it<br>
 Or being free will just be<br>
 Words and nothing more </p>
<p>It helps that it's a banger of a song - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX0H_anNJE4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX0H_anNJE4</a>.</p>
<p>What about you guys?</p></p>

        <p>For Me, I'm just glad God has woken Me up to the truth. Of course people will never get it, and these day's I'm very silent doing My own thing. There is no point in showing logic to illogical people.</p>
<p>Faith, being positive keeps Me going. Also, thankfully I have an American passport. So, living in this draconian Ontario, I can't wait to gtf out of here. Canada will be 1 of the first countries to collapse. It's a doomer hub. So, if you can then get out and live free. Be positive, make like minded friends and avoid the sheep. Life will be peaceful and lastly be content with what you have.</p>

        <p>I'm older, have been through a lot of shit, and have always come through it as long as I stayed true to myself and didn't act out of fear. And I've always been an oddball, so I'm used to carching shit for doing my own thing (or not doing what everybody else is doing). </p>
<p>On top of that, I've lived long enough to see people collectively lose thair minds on several occasions, and eventually it burns itself out. They may not return to full sanity, and things may not go back fully to the way they were before, but the most intense insanity eventually abates. It's just a matter of recognizing, "Oh, look--everybody's lost their fucking minds again," and staying out of crazy people's way until the madness passes.</p>

        <p>I think for me it's realizing that you could end up with life long problems from taking the vaccine.  You can obviously end up with long term effects from covid-19 but you may never get covid-19.  I rather take my chances since I haven't gotten it and it's been a year.  For other people, it's really not their business.  I've had people try and pressure me and it's not fun.  However it's your life and you get to decide what you do with it.  If you're not comfortable (neither am i) then don't get it until it's been tested more.  There's nothing wrong with thinking differently.  This sub has helped me a lot.  Before I felt so alone.  I think having a support network helps a lot.</p>

        <p>Just think about how fun it will be to hold the moral high ground when years later the possible long term side effects begin rearing their ugly head.</p>

        <p>You know, Covid is actually a great life lesson.</p>
<p>Throughout life people are going to tell you "You can't do that". People you don't know and hate will tell you that to squash you. People you love may tell you that because they honestly think it's the best thing for you.</p>
<p>And in life, you need to learn how to dig deep and tell those people "Fuck you. I can do this."</p>
<p>Find that power inside yourself for living while Covid exists, asking out girls, trying to get that promotion, skiing that black diamond trail you never thought you could, writing that song or novel or play, starting on that sports team even if you are the smallest guy in the field... And on and on and on.</p>
<p>The anthem is a good idea too. I think the song is just helping you find that fire inside.</p>

        <p>I'm a stubborn bitch, and it's almost like my whole life has been training for this. I've had people in my life who would try to manipulate me with insults and threats, "if you don't do XYZ then you're a bad person," "do ABC or you'll deserve whatever happens to you," etc. I figured out a long time ago that it was BS, and now it doesn't really work. I do what I want. Willing to listen to a reasoned argument about why I should do something different and if the argument is good I'll consider changing my mind, but if it's lazy propaganda, insults, and clearly cooked data, nah.</p>
