        <p>Holy shit! What a horrible wife and woman, sounds like he’s the one who should be considering divorce. Jesus who posts this kind of shit to reddit and can tolerate these responses about ones spouse!? This is truly disturbing to me.</p>

        <p>I would take major issue with anyone who speaks about my husband so horribly, even if he did throw a "tantrum" over something. He's tolerated much worse from me. I'd assume this woman is a neurotic bitch on a non-pandemic day, but that would be an insult to female canines.</p>

<p>My husband and I disagree, quite often. There's habits he has that I do not like, and vice-versa. But if I divorced him long ago over something like this, I'd have lost out on many happy memories we ended up making together. I hate how Reddit acts like the answer is always to break up and divorce (...or murder) instead of communicating with your significant other. Ditching your partner should be a last resort, unless it's something involving abuse.</p>

        <p>Reddit, or the government? Or both?</p>
<p>I think a lot of people on Reddit are just being "young" (I use this term very loosely), and stupid, and they think disagreements on anything between a couple is grounds for an instant break-up.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>/r/relationships user: My fiance wants me to wear a white wedding dress. I want a blue one. We keep arguing about this, and can't seem to come to any compromise. What should we do?</p>
<p>Top comment: CANCEL THE WEDDING AND DUMP HIS ASS! YOUR FIANCE IS A MISOGYNISTIC PIECE OF TRASH THAT WILL OPPRESS YOU. HE WANTS YOU TO WEAR <strong>WHITE</strong>? SEE, HE IS TRADITIONAL AND PROBABLY A TRUMP SUPPORTER!</p>
<p>I kid you not, this is how a lot of those type of posts go.</p>

<p>Seriously, this woman is in her 60s and has never been in a serious relationship in her life. Similar to how she's never had to fill out an application or go to an interview to get a job. I'm not even counting her 10+ year marriage to my husband's father, because she clearly didn't take that relationship seriously, she only wanted him because she had a hunch that he could get her pregnant. When my husband reached adolescence, mother divorced father on the grounds of abuse. Of course she takes every opportunity to cheer divorce and speak ill of men, does the whole "strong independent woman" schtick, yet can barely turn the light on or off without calling her son for help. She's a generally kind caring woman, but she has a warped view of human relationships and no authority to be preaching the virtues of divorce to every married woman she knows.</p>
<p>Definitely not just a young people thing.</p>

        <p>You said it, not me. Mentally retarded people can still be generally kind and caring though. They just might not be very good at it in practice, since their other capacities aren't quite up to par. Really though, I don't know about mental retardation, but I do think she has histrionic personality disorder. And probably a bit of dementia now too. Should also point out that she was morbidly obese and almost 40 years old with a uterine cyst the size of a football when she had my husband, and he was born severely premature because the uterine cyst was too big for him to continue growing in the womb. He was lucky he didn't turn out crippled or retarded. This was after his mother had several miscarriages and was warned against further pregnancies, but I guess she just needed the right man.</p>

        <p>Addressed this in another comment, but I'll gladly paste this mod response again:</p>
<p>"Everyone, reddit has a rule against advocating for violence. Anti-maskers will absolutely report you for 'threatening/inciting violence' even if you are absolutely joking because they are stupid. Make it clear in your comments that you are joking."</p>
<p>Because only anti-maskers report people for joking about murder. Okay then.</p>

        <p>Meh. I know it's easy to make those sort of assumptions, but I've known people who are the opposite of basement dwellers in terms of their social standing, and whatnot, and they give equally shitty advice, and seem to have shitty views on relationships. A lot of people are really clueless on how to handle relationships, especially when there's conflict involved.</p>

        <p>These kind of people use any excuse they can to advocate divorce. Judging by that post, the situation in New Zealand, and this idea than we're responsible for the health of millions of total strangers, these people have zero respect or understanding in regards to how human society actually functions. Nevermind your husband's thoughts or feelings, old sick people you barely know are so much more important.</p>

<p>&rt; "something as childish as wearing a mask"?!?!? Are you fucking for real?? Do you know there's a pandemic plaguing the world right now? That hundreds of thousands have died and millions are sick?!? Do you fucking understand what's happening around you? And why wearing a mask is important right now?? </p>
<p>&rt; Yes, being a single working mother is so much better than staying with a selfish dickhead who is willing to risk the lives of his own children because of his selfishness!!! At least, they'll be alive and healthy!!</p>
<p>&rt; For fuck's sake! It's a mask! Nobody is asking him to sacrifice his fucking right arm here!! Just fucking wear a fucking mask so you can be safe and keep your family safe. How hard is that for you to understand?!?! A billion fucking years of evolution and what do we have to show for it? Selfish fucktards like you who'll happily hurt your own family simply cus you can't wear a fucking mask!!!</p>
