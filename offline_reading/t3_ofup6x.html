    <strong>Ask yourself: since when do pharmaceutical corporations and governments care about our health?</strong>
    <p><p>This “pandemic” has a 99%+ survival rate.</p>
<p>Go ahead and drink/smoke yourself to death all you want, but please go get the jab. Do it for grandma. </p>
<p>You know it, we all know it, there is an ulterior motive behind getting billions of people injected and we'll be seeing the results of this injecting over the next 10 years. </p>
<p>Maybe recipients will start dying of natural causes much earlier than expected, maybe their immune systems will collapse, maybe they will become sterile, maybe their offspring will be born sterile or defective in some other way. Who knows for sure, but we can safely assume that a slow, controlled depopulation is the true goal. You can't have six billion bodies rotting all at once. It has to be a slow burn.</p></p>

        <p>I don’t think the vaccine is a sort of “bio weapon” but I’m sure these companies made a hell of a buck selling it to the gov/people almost as if government partners with pharma companies for profit.</p>

        <p>Well said. It all makes perfect sense when we look at the vast criminal history of “Big Pharma”. </p>
<p>Pharma grew out of the alliance of the Nazi war machine-building German Dye Trust, I.G. Farben, and Rockefeller’s cutthroat Standard Oil and eugenics-obsessed “philanthropy” rackets.</p>
<p>The entire “plandemic” is under control of the criminal complex that continued to expand after WWII. It includes Rockefeller/Pharma fronts like WHO, CDC, AMA, FDA, WEF, IBM, Johns Hopkins, Harvard, Yale and other major universities. The CIA serves this complex.</p>

        <p>I think its a doublethink operation to be honest. The same people who were happy to criticize big pharma for the opioid epidemic, asbestos in products etc. are now their biggest champions.</p>

        <p>I don't know which kind of libertarian utopia you live in, but where I'm at, the government does a lot to stop people from smoking themselves to death. It's illegal to smoke in bars and restaurants, advertising is illegal, you need to move 10 meters away from an entrance to a public building to smoke, cigarette packaging needs to be neutral and without a logo, you can't have it on display at all and last but not least it's heavily taxed. Claiming that governments do nothing to limit smoking is simply not based on reality. So your entire post fails apart right from the get-go. </p>
<p>But I'm still curious as to the ulterior motive you think is behind it. I'd also love to hear how pharmaceutical companies managed to bribe basically every government on the planet into poisoning their citizens while the tobacco industry, which has at least as much capital, failed miserably in most of the first world.</p>
