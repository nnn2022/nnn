        <p>Δ, or Delta, means change. Oh my, did we all experience change. Everyone lost something in this crisis, some temporary, others permanently.</p>
<p>Societies, more divided than ever have emerged. The tension is palatable. Because change can be painful, frightening, and it can hurt.</p>
<p>Whether one applauds or condemns the changes, some changes seen, are quite frightening, indeed. Nobel prize winning scientists are being censored, debates in western parliaments quickly deleted. A Canadian viral immunologist, publicly slandered. Doctors fired, and some suspended. A Harvard professor of medicine was banned from Twitter. Strange side effects are barely mentioned. The co-inventor of mRNA, removed from Linked-In. Early Covid treatment, not even considered. It all violates the ‘community guidelines’.</p>
<p>That is only the tip of an iceberg, since that what is deleted, cannot be found, heard or seen.</p>
<p>We all lost freedoms. For what once was constitutional, is conditional now. Is it temporary? Nobody can tell. Two weeks to flatten the curve, they said. Sick until proven healthy, we test. </p>
<p>Because, it was just two weeks, it's just a mask, it's just a jab, it's just six feet, it's just an App, another jab, a code for lunch, and now the kids, they are at risk. It's just a test, and then we trace, to close your shop, just two more weeks, now no more tests but a booster please – to protect yourself, and the rest. </p>
<p>The WHO said, median survival rate: 99.8 percent.</p>
<p>It’s all for health and for the best. Let’s put in place, social credit next.</p>
