        <p>Yes.  The left wants the economy to be bad.</p>
<p>Understand, the lockdowns presented an opportunity for the left to sow discord and foment insurrection (see the riots).  An improving economy diminishes the motivation for people to see collectivism as a viable option.</p>

        <p>I feel like this can't possibly be true for most people who identify as being on the left. I <em>think</em> most people are rational and fairly normal despite political differences. I think political operatives in the media and in certain expert circles are exploiting people's good nature to further their agenda.</p>

        <p>&rt;I feel like this can't possibly be true for most people who identify as being on the left. I think most people are rational and fairly normal despite political differences.</p>
<p>I'm a lefty.  I do think there are certain people on the left who would use the crisis to push for policies like universal health care or UBI, and clearly we're seeing right now with the protests/riots that there are a lot of people who would rather burn everything to the ground if it meant getting their policies implemented.</p>
<p>But I don't think that's the majority of lefties, and judging based off of what I've seen, I think a combination of a) the lockdown, b) the riots and c) the hypocrisy regarding the lack of social distancing in the protests/riots is <em>seriously</em> turning off a lot of left leaning people.  It's turned me off for sure.  It's not like my core beliefs are going to change but it's definitely made me cynical in a lot of ways that I wasn't before.  I've definitely seen this in at least a few cases online as well, and to be clear, this isn't milquetoast moderates who are just slightly left of center.  I'm talking <em>Bernie</em> people here.</p>
<p>Personally my opinion is that if the left really does want everything to go to shit just to get Trump out (which may subconsciously be the case, but I don't think it's anyone's consciously stated goal or anything), it's going to fail.  I think a combination of the dem governors pushing/extending/botching the lockdowns, the riots, and the fact that Biden is just a mess in general is going to pretty much guarantee Trump's re-election.</p>

        <p>Collectivism is their goal you’re right. It’s a much more apt word than communism because it’s a mentality and a culture.</p>

        <p>I dont think he wants the numbers to be bad, they should just be looked at with some skepticism. An increase is expected as things open up, but people that are pro Lock want to say "hey look, youre wrong it didnt affect the economy negatively at all" and we should guard against that</p>

        <p>The reality is that the same jobs increase occurred in Canada.  It's accurate, just disappointing for someone who wants our entire country to fail to salve their ideology.</p>
<p>Krugman has been shrill and silly many times.  He's certainly no level-head.</p>
