        <p>No... You have to wear the mask because if the rule becomes "you don't have to wear a mask if you're vaccinated" a whole lot of unvaccinated people won't wear their mask anymore, which then would increase the numbers again. Like come on man, it's basic critical thinking.</p>

        <p>Just wait until you have to show your papers. Those people will know exactly where you live! The government even knows what your face looks like because there's a photo of you on those papers. And let's not forget the tracking device everybody calls mobile phones. I'm just happy with my vaccination because now I have free 5g wherever I go. As an added bonus I can cook food with my left arm now, all I have to do is hold an egg against it, call with my mobile phone through the 5g network for a minute, and the egg is cooked!</p>

        <p>You're now twice as likely to die from the vaccination. Double doses are no joke. I asked if my fish had to get vaccinated as well, but apparently they don't have lungs so they can't get covid. Maybe I'll sell my lungs on the black market to earn some extra money. If fish can live without lungs so can I.</p>

        <p>yep. I believe Trump was mocked for saying;
“We have the most cases because we test the most”.</p>
<p>Of course all it took was typical media treatment.
Have authoritative interviewer look disgusted with the “evil trump” and boom.
Majority of ppl wind up forwarding me a video clip of it and are all like
“can you believe this idiot?”</p>
<p>yea… I guess we had a good ride.</p>
<p>I’m honestly a bit “worried” about this all going to a whole nother level.

        <p>He was probably right when comparing to Vietnam or South America but very likely wrong when comparing to Germany and UK.</p>
<p>And he was right when comparing historical numbers, in my mind when I look at the infection graph with the 2 waves I always have to tell myself the first one was probably twice as big but we didn't have the tests, and the summer valley was probably overtested, and for the second wave they changed the PCR round number so the test is reasonably sensitive (35 rounds instead of 42, but I have no source for exact numbers it's all mentioned as manufacturers standards have changed).</p>
<p>And the US isn't alone in this the notion of Case has changed twist in Italy and UK, which makes it dificult to compare waves and compare to other outbrakes.</p>

It was me watching a few "Japan Tour" videos on YouTube, where I observed Tokyoians? wearing Masks everywhere on the street (to allegedly protect them from covid19) then are seen many times inside bars and restaurants shoulder to shoulder laughing and talking with no Masks on - because covid19 takes a break apparently.</p>

        <p>In my country you still have to wear a mask in public transport, but only when standing or moving around (the usual). Thing is you can sit across from each other <em>and</em> next to each other, so two full sets of seats, with no mask. Like covid forgets what it’s supposed to do when people sit down. </p>
<p>What’s even sadder is seeing people hold their hand or maybe their t-shirt over their mouth when coming in, I’ve seen kids cover their mouth with their hand until they got to a seat. It’s so fucking meaningless and just goes to show how brainwashed the population is. A lot of people still wear masks on the stations as well even though it’s not required. I seriously don’t get it. People are just jumping because they got told to do so</p>

<p>&rt; It's clear that unvaccinated people are not following the recommended indoor-masking guidelines, he notes. "You go into a grocery store and 95% of the people are unmasked when we haven't come close to that level of vaccination," Miller says. This can put people at risk, including children, and people who are immunocompromised.</p>
<p>&rt;Miller says he continues to wear a mask in public places, even though he's fully vaccinated. "I know that I am extremely unlikely to get seriously ill. But I also know that if I am exposed, I may become infected and pass it on to others," he says.</p>
<p>You won’t find this (lack of) logic from the CDC or anyone official, but it definitely exists on an individual level. I’ve heard it firsthand from people too.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic spread is very rare. We’re never going to get herd immunity. The vaccines don’t prevent the spread of the virus. Also temperature checks are and have been theater. Does anybody actually even bother to get a real reading?</p>

        <p>Does anybody here even bother to do some logical thinking? It doesn't matter if the virus keeps getting spread. The vaccinations aren't made to do that. They're made to make the infections way less severe, or even completely asymptotic. What's a disease if you don't suffer from it? Exactly.</p>

        <p>I had covid once mid February 2020. I didnt even know about covid then. I just had this weird shitty sickness for 2 weeks and another 3 weeks to get back to normal. I didnt even miss a day of work. My immune system handled it then and it'll do fine IF I get it again. Idk anyone who's gotten it twice except for vaccinated people!? Go figure.. Lets fuck up my immune system which worked flawlessly. Personal experience&rt;lying officials. Ive never gotten a cold shot before!? There is no cure for the common cold no shots that I'm aware of. Ive never taken a flu vaccine either. Not because I'm antivaxx but because I have a healthy immune system. Ive taken others, in a metal worker so tetanus every 5-10 years or whatever.</p>

        <p>Do you lift weights, or do you tell everyone that you’re already <em>so strong</em> there’s no reason to exercise? </p>
<p>“I’m not going to fuck up my muscles by squatting, bro. That shit’s dangerous!”</p>
<p>Vaccines are training for your immune system: they make your immune system stronger and more efficient. Sure, your immune system is probably strong, but even Olympic athletes need to train if they want to win.</p>
<p>We’re already researching vaccines for the common cold and HIV using the same tech we pioneered to fight Covid19.  It amazes me how people refuse one of the biggest medical breakthroughs of our lifetimes: mRNA vaccines.</p>

        <p>No, I go to work and lift things that actually matter. I'm strong because I do things to survive like hunt, cut firewood, and other things humans need to do to survive. Im fine the way i was designed and ill die when its my time. Viruses train my immune system. That's what its for. I'm aware theyre beneficial. I went to public school. Polio was terrible, covid isnt polio, it isn't the plague, it only kills people with weak immune systems. I dont need chemicals. Excercise, eat right, and you'll be fine. Follow the science!</p>

        <p>Rather than having to infect yourself with every disease in existence to build immunity, we’ve invented a crazy tech that builds immunity without getting sick. We call them vaccines, and they’re fantastic at building up your immune system with minimal effort from you, just stopping at your nearest pharmacy.</p>
<p>You don’t want these vaccines, however, because you prefer to build immunity the old fashioned way, IE by contracting potentially fatal infections. Why get a little shot, when you can be sick for weeks? </p>
<p>Back when people just rode out every infection they caught, it was pretty common to die of infection by 30-40. 60 was ancient, you had to be lucky to not shit yourself to death before 50.</p>
<p>Now we take our long lives for granted, and have deluded ourselves into thinking our bodies are invincible temples. Even 600k dead Americans are not enough to wake people up from their false sense of immortality.</p>

        <p>600k out of 400 million is relatively low risk. Nobody should die I'm not a monster but I say we pick our battles. Ive heard the atatement from both sides "if this was a real pandemic wed be screwed" and "now we've learned for the next one". There's plenty of worse things out there that haven't stoooed the world. This was purely political. I'm less skeptical of a "vaccine" from the goverment when its been politicized to the point that credible world renowned doctors have been silenced, careers ruined, deplatfirmed for trying to educate people on real medicines with real studies. 2 weejs to flatten the curve, then 2 jabs to normal life, now its everyone needs this or well never get back to normal. Youre missing the bug picture. What happened to "my body, my choice"? Why am I attacked for exercising my freedoms? Can you answer those questions for me?</p>

        <p>Covid19 proved milder than our initial fears, yeah. We got lucky in that only 600k died, and not 60 million, because we <em>really</em> fumbled the ball last year. Worst thing that’s every happened to the US, like a hundred 9/11s, but a really bad pandemic could end our civilization (Smallpox and the Aztecs, for example.</p>
<p>My body, my choice is a progressive slogan, a slogan easily forgotten during a war. Nobody asked to go to Vietnam or Iwo Jima. “For the Greater Good” is the slogan of choice during crisis.</p>
<p>You’re attacked for exercising your freedoms because it can potentially hurt others. We’re not free to drive 100+mph because that makes us much more likely to run over someone’s kid. Likewise, nobody wants you inadvertently killing their grandparents.</p>
<p>FWIW, had we gone super-hardcore in Spring 2020, welding people into their apartments and shooting the sick like the CCP did in Wuhan, we likely would’ve avoided most of this disaster. But, during an election year, culling the sick is bad PR.</p>

        <p>I'm a firm believer in personal responsibility, when my ill uncle is on oxygen, we took plenty of precautions before he was vaxxed and loosened up a bit after. I completely understand taking others health into consideration and very sorry to hear about your grandfather. Its a shame a real hero had to go through that alone. </p>
<p>Again, I'm not saying there arent benefits from the vaccine it is quite remarkable and a testament to civilization banding together. The main problem in my opinion is absolute disregard for human rights laid out by the constitution. Peoples freedom of choice is paramount to our republic. If we can't travel to other states in the future due to vax mandates the union falls apart. Coercive choice is not freedom. Saying that I will kill a vaccinated person because I'm unvaccinated goes against what weve been taught about immunity. It makes no sense to restrict the movements of a majority of the population to extend the lives of sick people. Again sorry for your loss but in a free country id be alliwed to risk my own life to see my grandfather on his death bed. Tyranny scares me far more than any virus. Governments have killed many people, not as many as illness but way more healthy people, That's for sure. Being a conservative and called a fascist for the past 5 years forced me to learn exactly what fascism is. The Whitehouse suppressing free speech, labeling healthy skeptics as murders, dehumanizing us, removing our ability to work and provide for our families. The problem isnt covid or the vax, its control, greed, and an untrustworthy system. The left has convinced POC that the government is against them and exoects them to take an experimental vaccine when our government has inhumanely tested on them before. The media science is fighting itself, they tell us one thing and do another. I'm sorry that the scientist catch so much shit, I mostly blame Fauci. Theres a lot that doesnt add up and he's responsible for all of it. His own emails contradict what he tells the public, he also is an investor in both wuhan labs and modern. Hes had more to gain than anyone else from this. I saw him today arguing with rand paul, I'm pretty sure he got a face lift...</p>

        <p>I remember when we got our first Covid19 specimens in April 2020 and the CDC told us to <em>not</em> wear masks or N95s. Fuck that, I brought my own N95 in from Home Depot. They’ve been screwing up their messaging ever since.</p>
<p>I remember when our first CDC-made Covid tests were faulty, making everything negative. We had to throw out thousands of tests.</p>
<p>I also remember when Kamala Harris told everyone that she wouldn’t take any vaccine developed by Trump’s Operation Lightspeed. PoC heard her and remain one of the least-vaccinated groups. Can’t put the genie back into the bottle, she’s blown her credibility.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I’m just a grunt, and can’t control what happens with the top brass. All I could do was privately rage and keep plugging away at my job, ignoring the danger.</p>
<p>I’m a history buff, love wargames etc. Analogy I like to use is the Hoplite Phalanx. We all might be good spearmen individually,  but if we stay in formation and march in the same direction, nobody can break our spear wall.</p>
<p>So that’s what I’m trying to do, keep the formation together until the battle is won.</p>

        <p>Also id like to say as a single person dating, my opinions make me a pariah theses days, That's how passionately I believe them. I will ostracize myself and fight for freedom because thats what a patriot does. I have everything to lose in many scenarios, no matter what happens, at least I have the peace of mind knowing it was MY choice. My beliefs matter! There are also religious exeptions for medical treatment, its their right as Americans. There will never be a world where everyone can get vaccinated, so why force it on those who don't want it?</p>

        <p>Sorry bro, I wear condoms. I also don't eat brain or spinal tissue from wild animals. I boil questionable water before I drink it. Im not anti-science or anti-covid. I'm anti-government. We've been lied to repeatedly. I understand theres risk just like theres risk from the flu. Things can mutate and become vaccine resistant too. Your fear driven, panic inducing, powers that be want us to deny what weve been taught our whole lives. Before chicken pox vaccines, you did intentionally expose children to the virus because its much more dangerous for adults who've never had it. This is the exact opposite. Kids are relatively fine for the same reasons they were with chicken pox, but you expect them to take a "vaccine" with no antigen to save the elderly that would have died of the flu anyway? The flu vaccine makes sense, the mRNA does not. High risk patients should absolutely take the covid vaccine. My uncle with copd did. We all encouraged it but my healthy family members did not and will not, including healthcare workers I know personally.</p>

        <p>Our ancestors ate smallpox scabs to vaccinate themselves against smallpox.</p>
<p>That was the first vaccine, but it sucked because even a mild case of smallpox is painful. Just like having chicken pox as a kid sucks.</p>
<p>Modern vaccines have enough antigen to make you immune without making you get a full-blown infection. </p>
<p>It’s not difficult concept to grasp. And there are side effects, of course, because  you are training your immune system: you get sore after a workout.</p>

        <p>The mRNA vaccine doesn't have any antigen though. It creates covid like spike proteins to confuse the natural immune system. Its not the same process at all. Yet I'm on reddit because if I talked like this on facebook, ill be banned. Peoples fears are justified and yet were called crazy antivaxx nutjobs. I had covid and antibodies so why do I still need the mRNA vaccine?</p>

        <p>I’m pointing out how silly it sounds to say “I don’t need a vaccine because I’m so healthy!”</p>
<p>A vaccine is a training regimen for your immune system, and everyone can benefit from additional training, even Arnold Schwarzenegger. </p>
<p>The stronger your immune system, the better your response to the vaccine, because you’ve got more cells to train. Men can build bigger muscles than women, because they are stronger from the get-go.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you’re immunocompromised, ie you have no immune system, the vaccine is useless for you because you can’t train what doesn’t exist.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I can totally understand that but if I can still transmit the virus with this vaccine wouldnt I still pass it to the immunocompromised who are unable to recieve the vaccine? I had covid as I stated in another comment so that means I have covid antibodies, correct? So my statements of a healthy immune system and lifestyle are correct. Its really easy to angry especially with a scientist whose denying facts that could help people. It feels like to me that through all of this were suppised to forget its a survivable virus and natural immunity works just as well as it does for the flu. I'm not convinced ill never get covid again and frankly I kinda expect to like the flu. I know immunity can wear off, I'm not sold that this tyoe of vaccine is the best option for relatively healthy people. Thats my argument. Doubly for children!</p>

        <p>My favorite one is the whole 'asymptomatic' thing. Basically most people think COVID is a death sentence for 50% of people. So if you got vaccinated, then you had a mild infection, that means the vaccine works. But that's how COVID infection looks like for 99% of people, even the unvaccinated ones.</p>
<p>Same with masks. Just because you wore a mask all year long and didn't get sick doesn't mean that they work. I haven't really worn a mask unless forced to and I didn't get sick either. It's hard to get sick during the summer mostly staying home.</p>

        <p>PCR tests way over count.</p>
<p>PCR is designed to amplify any amount of a material.  You remember how the media and experts talk about viral load?  PCR measures the presence of a virus down to very small viral loads.  It even will detect fragments of virus, which means your body can get a small weakened virus load (say from touching a door handle 20 minutes after somebody else) and your immune system can fight the virus and even bear it fairly easily, and it can destroy that virus and leave fragments to train more cells and that can get picked up and set off a PCR test. </p>
<p>And it's not a secret <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmp2025631">that using PCR tests is not perfect</a></p>
<p>The reason it does this is because polymerase are dumb proteins that don't know what to replicate and as such just replicate everything they see.  So you put some virus rna in, some raw materials, the protein that assembles it all and then sequence what you have.  Simple. </p>
<p>It's actually great as a first test to diagnose when you think about it.  Yeah we want to know if any amount is I'm you at all.  Then you need to follow up and figure out why you got a positive test and what that means for where you are in your illness and treatment.</p>

        <p>DNA polymerases are incredibly specific proteins that only bind to an exact genetic sequence. No exact genetic sequence, nothing gets replicated.</p>

        <p>The randomly sealed off supermarket shelves last winter was ludicrous. I believe it was an attempt to be fair to other "non-essential" businesses that were ordered to close, or maybe it was to discourage shopping around. It was farce either way.</p>
<p>You could buy gift wrapping paper, but not the ribbons nor cards. Paper binders were OK, but not clothes-hangers, except those on sale.  You could get the shaft of a mob, but not the swab.</p>

        <p>There was a video by WHO telling not to use masks if you are not ill or taking care of ill patients, that masks can cause infection all by themselves. But then everyone has to use it all the time.  </p>
<p>Here in argentina we have a ton of those, for example there was a peak when people started going for runs, but not on any massive event planned by the government.</p>

        <p>I seem to remember it being reported that the flu was basically non-existent in 2020, and that was credited with the fact that people were wearing masks, anti-social distancing, and washing their hands. And at the same time, covid case were “soaring”, and this was due to the fact that people weren’t wearing masks, weren’t anti-social distancing, and not washing their hands. 😐</p>
