    <strong>Exposing The Weakness of Censorship</strong>
    <p><p>We all know we have we have had our voices silenced if we have a different opinion from the mainstream reherotic. If we speak out in public we are attacked, if we speak on the internet we are cancled. There is never only one side to the story, but in their eyes there is.</p>
<p>The tactics the mainstrem and it's followers use are mind tricks. If you have a different opinion they will insult, threaten, and act ignorant. The tactics used are consentraded on creating self doubt and fear unless you agree with them, or your against them. If you are against them in their eyes, they will continue to harass. </p>
<p>These attitudes lead to censorship. Censorship comes when they get tired of being ignorant, and hit the mute button cancelling anyone who dose not have the same opinion. The mainstream ideology continues to push the insults, threats, and fear. The main objective of pushing these elements while being silenced is to keep the opposition quite and in doubt, until they they are forced to agree with mainstream ideology out of submission and subjection to constant propagnda.</p>
<p>How is this defeated?. It is defeated by independant thinking, open discussion, and most importantly strong self confidence. This is what the mainstream followers fear the most. Never let anyone change your mind, no matter how much they try to silence us. By standing your ground not just by your self, but with everyone else even thousands of miles apart, we are unbreakable in the darkest of times.</p></p>
