    <strong>I'd like to aggregate information on how deaths/infections are being counted here.</strong>
    <p><p>As an introduction, I believe the death count to be wildly overestimated for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>PCR tests pick up any and everything, even dead virus. They have been used more frequently during COVID than any other time period in history. </li>
<li>The CARES Act provides for a significant (120%) reimbursement for medicare patients who have COVID. This increase 5 fold if they are then put on a ventilator. </li>
<li>Doctors have the ability to determine (in many cases without tests) whether or not a patient has and/or died from COVID.</li>
</ol>
<p>This means that we are incentivizing our healthcare system to inflate the numbers for financial gain. I am NOT suggesting this is a conspiracy of doctors. I am suggesting that they are under pressure to code COVID as much as they can from hospital administrators.</p>
<p>I'll add a few comments below. I would ask the mods to please sticky this post so we can formulate and support good arguments. I also ask that we do not submit links from partisan news sources. It would be better and more reputable if we submitted journals, CDC/NHS write ups, and verified data/charts.</p>
<p>Lastly, I believe this is the easiest, most verifiable way to cut through the garbage that surrounds this virus. If we can demonstrate through data and official paperwork that the numbers are inflated, the house of cards will come tumbling down, as every lock down and mandate is based on these numbers.</p></p>

        <p>To start:</p>
<p>Please note that:</p>
<p>"There is no evidence or proof offered by any scientist, pathologist, or virologist that confirms COVID-19 as the “cause” of death in the certification process. 
An expanded definition of a “COVID-19 death” was enacted by the CDC on March 24th, to include probable cases. This conflates and clusters test results creating a source of both under and overestimation. “COVID-19 deaths are identified using a new ICD-10 code. When COVID-19 is reported as a cause of death or when it is listed as a ‘probable’ or ‘presumed’ cause, it is coded as UO7.1 This can include cases with or without laboratory confirmation.'"</p>
<p>"All deaths of patients with a linkage to COVID-19 are now classified as “COVID-19 deaths regardless of cause or underlying health issues that could have contributed to loss of life.” - Dr. Deborah Birx</p>
