    <strong>Toronto’s Dr. Eileen de Villa[in] Propagating Irrational Fear and Promoting Irreversible Damage to the Economy</strong>
    <p><p>To all          of those people                   who happen to be sick                   of DeVilla[in]’s slow,               pandering,                and insulting                tone and pace            of speech,            read on. </p>
<p>I had to start this thread with a title as click-baity as all our mainstream media has come to use because that seems to be the world we are living in these days. </p>
<p>I need to preface my thoughts and observations with two details - I am a simple contractor living in Toronto - and just like Dr. Eileen de Villa - titled ‘de Villain’ who is stepping out of her lane as a doctor actually affecting policy she was not elected to govern, I will be stepping out of my lane as a builder to simply engage in some discussion. </p>
<p>Posting in r/nonewnormal - I understand my audience will side with me, but I encourage those finding this from the outside to actually consider my viewpoint. </p>
<p>DeVilla works in an appointed position as “Toronto’s top doctor” as the Medical Officer of Health for the City of Toronto. I understand the role this position plays on a day to day basis, and that while people in the public health sector can make RECOMMENDATIONS to our politicians, they cannot and should not be put in a position of propaganda on television every day. She is asserting her views/opinions to the public in the biggest showing of fear mongering I have ever seen. All this before her assertions are tabled for legislature. </p>
<p>All this propaganda and daily fear mongering leads to increased case numbers - the metric that has shaken our society to the core. Now - I’m not a doctor, or a lawyer, or a professor, but I’ve built houses for all these types. That said, I really don’t appreciate the preachy tone Devilla[in] has taken with the public over the recent escalation of case numbers. I wouldn’t talk down to a doctor or lawyer that doesn’t know how to swing a hammer. The same doctors that hold themselves to high esteem all live in boxes we call homes, that despite their brilliance, they often can’t begin to explain how to build one. We are all guilty of driving cars and using phones when we don’t understand all of their workings. </p>
<p>We, in Toronto especially, have seen a “drastic” increase in these figures in the recent weeks. We have ALSO seen a corresponding increase in tests, all the while seeing a lowering fatality rate relative to both.  If we began operating other factions of our lives based on the way we are overreacting to the Covid data, Canadians would be outlawed from driving - over 110,000 motor vehicle accidents annually on average in Canada dating back 20 years. My god - a total of over 2,000,000 incidents!! Cars are unsafe! </p>
<p>At the same time, the “woke” left is decrying for the police to be defunded, we are being herded into lockdown compliance for the small minority of people, often with preexisting conditions, that may suffer negative outcomes when processing COVID. Not only will the majority of people that get COVID be symptom free - their demographics by age show virtually no risk. Only those past the age of 75 start showing slight increased risk factors pertaining to COVID, and only further exacerbated by preexisting conditions. Sadly, with or without COVID, anyone past the age of 70 already has higher general mortality rates than younger generations. We still validate and accept a wide variety of elderly deaths in illnesses like cancer, heart disease, pneumonia, and flu, yet we have all as a society fallen down the rabbit hole of closing everything down for a disproportionately small number of people with slightly elevated risk factors. No weddings, no thanksgiving, no getting together with anyone outside your household. No having a rational discussion over why it is acceptable to express one’s freedom of speech in a protest, yet discussing COVID and our collective situation has become verboten. Dining safely with friends and loved ones has become strictly verboten. Our neighbours to the south led by Andrew Cuomo have verboten the Jewish community from gathering while other boroughs of New York that have been similarly affected by COVID remain under less strict measures. There seems to be more and more in the way of what is verboten is being advertised to us all as “safe” and “for the good of us all.” Anyone, I repeat ANYONE that values their individuality AT ALL, cannot and should not agree with measures that, while perhaps not affecting you, are affecting others extremely negatively. </p>
<p>It has been shown that the lockdowns have disproportionately affected low paying paying and service industry jobs the most. Financially, many in these sectors were already living cheque to cheque before the world shut down. All the help in the world the government plans to offer still isn’t enough to cover living expenses, doesn’t inspire any way to get people thinking rationally and getting back to where we were as a society Pre-COVID, and only further socializes an already burdened system. All the pro-lockdown voices, have you stopped to ask who is going to pay for all of this? Government payouts to individuals and businesses have to come from somewhere. Surely a vote for lockdown is a vote to increase everyone’s taxes as well? Surely we can ALL agree that option sucks. I have seen far too many posts with people elated they have an entire theatre to themselves. They don’t question that there haven’t been any good movie releases, and if this became the new business model, the cineplex would begin charging $250 per seat to cover their costs and operate profitably. </p>
<p>What is bothering me most is that all the people happy to lockdown and mask up in their convertibles aren’t asking the real questions. They are allowing unelected DeVilla[in]’s to scare them with meaningless numbers called “cases” before allowing public pressure to shape baseless government policy. Personally, I don’t care one way or another if, for the moment, we might have to wear masks to curb everyone’s delusions. I wear my “argument avoider” where mandated because I don’t much like stupid confrontation. What I cannot do is stand by and watch while every small business withers and dies as they struggle to survive. Restaurants operate at a loss under the new regime. Less alcohol - the real profit driver - is being purchased. Fewer patrons can frequent an establishment, but their rent costs haven’t gone down.</p>
<p>Depression has gone up, people are at home ALONE drinking. None of this is healthy. People are social creatures. In every instance of civilization over the past 5,000 years, we have come together in groups and have worked collectively on agriculture, business, city operations that benefit us all. This is bigger than COVID - this rationale of the herd operating at the level of the weakest link has been ever increasing in my view over the last 20 years. I expect everyone to operate at their maximum potential, as this has always benefited society as a whole. I do not agree with placing restrictions on those who are willing and able when those who are unwilling and scared become the voices of power. If you feel unsafe going out in public, use an app and have your stuff delivered to your “safe” bubble. Don’t impose business closures because you don’t want to mingle with the “COVIDIOTS” - not my term. If you don’t want your kid to die of the peanut allergy that YOUR genes gave them, don’t make everyone else bend their knee and cater to them - homeschool that minority - don’t put your burdens on us all. I’m coming from the viewpoint that we are all descendants of these social groupings of past civilizations. They were all exposed to disease, blight, drought, and all learned and grew from those experiences. We, living today are the mosaic of those experiences. We all benefit from modern medicine, but this is an evolution, it does not happen overnight. We cannot allow the world to stop when more “primitive” iterations of ourselves did not. Herd immunity isn’t something people seem to want to discuss these days, but we live with the flu, the cold, chicken pox, shingles, STDs, and many many other illnesses and lived our lives normally amongst these killers of few only a year ago. I ask everyone, implore everyone to look at this whole thing more rationally. We are driving the economy so far into the ground that we will be in perpetual lockdown by virtue of our decision making today. We all agree to live most aspects of our lives by a set of rules when interacting with others. We put our seatbelts on, we stay between the lines, stop at red lights, all while operating a machine, classified by some aspects of our criminal code as a lethal weapon. We know there is a small risk every time we get behind the wheel, just as we should operate on the metric that there is just this - a SMALL risk to the general public when going out to do anything - even ore-COVID. We allow people to drive race cars on tracks, to go skydiving, to go rock climbing, but allowing people to make safe choices for themselves has become an impossibility? Instead of shuttering doors to businesses that have as little control over COVID as the government, as any of us, perhaps those that feel a higher level of risk can stay home and allow the rest of the world to go on as normal? Stay at home, order your food, work remotely, be safe in your “bubble,” but don’t put your fear on the rest of us. </p>
<p>Just remember, we still live in a society that operates collectively on rules like “if a house is locked, I’m safe inside.” When all of the money does eventually run out from these perpetual lockdowns, remember this - all those affected by these lockdowns without a home to live in or food to eat, will break those doors down to get theirs from those who still have. While working from home may not affect you today, fallout in the months and years to come can, and will lead to anarchy worse than what America is seeing today. The rules and norms of something as simple as a lock on the door will become a thing of the past. 8 months in, and we are looking at irreparable damage to our privacy and freedom of speech. Discussion over this topic has become too heavily politicized. We all need to come together and agree that total collapse of our community businesses will lead to much much worse. Take away a man’s money, he can earn more, take away a man’s ability to earn money, you also take their pride and dignity. When a human crumbles to these primal remnants, the results often aren’t fun to watch. </p>
<p>de Villa[in] is not an elected official. Let those we actually voted for look at the big picture and try to work a way out of this mass hysteria, not further into it. There is no winning with this lockdown - for those who haven’t already seen this - “28 days later” will prove one of two things - that “lockdowns work” or if case numbers continue to go up that “lockdowns need to be further increased.” Neither of which is an option that anyone benefits from. </p>
<p>TLDR: sorry all, some things require more time and attention than the 10 second puppy video you just saw on YouTube. Our problem today is that no one takes the time to actually understand all of the connected elements involved in a topic. I hope I’ve shared some.</p></p>
