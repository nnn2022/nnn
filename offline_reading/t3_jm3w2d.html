<title>Anthony Fauci on PCR: “if you get a cycle threshold of 35 or more that the chances of it being replication competent are minuscule…you almost never can culture virus from a 37 threshold cycle. So I think if somebody comes in there with 37/38 even 36 you gotta say it’s just dead nucleotides period.”</title>

        <p>Keep in mind the cycle threshold in some Canadian provinces are over 35, in Ontario can be upwards of 40 and in Toronto some hospitals are at 45. Toronto is in the midst of lockdown hysteria over the high "case" count of late. Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7219382/table/tbl0005/?report=objectonly</p>
<p>A New York Times article on this subject: </p>
<p>https://archive.is/AdUSn#selection-815.0-815.223</p>
<p>"With a cutoff of 35, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30.</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, from 85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of 40 would have been deemed negative if the threshold were 30 cycles, Dr. Mina said. “I would say that none of those people should be contact-traced, not one,” he said."</p>
<p>A Post Media article on the same subject in Canada: </p>
<p>https://www.saltwire.com/lifestyles/health/when-is-a-case-of-covid-still-covid-critics-suggest-the-gold-standard-of-testing-could-be-too-sensitive-505061/) :</p>
<p>“Is it accurate to say that if you have somebody who has a CT value higher than 25 that they are less likely to be infectious? Yeah, that is accurate,” Bullard says. It’s also possible they could be infectious, though the probability decreases the higher the numbers of cycles you go.</p>
<p>Any virus that’s being picked up beyond 25 cycles is probably left over genetic material from dead virus, Bullard says. “But that doesn’t mean it’s a false positive, or that it’s not important to find people, still.” Regardless of the number of cycles, RT-PCR has a 99.8 per cent specificity, meaning it is hugely unlikely to show a false positive, or tag someone without the virus as having the virus.</p>
<p>“These people may have had the disease for two weeks or more, in which case, well, are we overcalling it? No, because they still were a case — we still have to track down all of their contacts from when they earlier had the disease,” Bullard says."</p>
<p>"According to Public Health Ontario data provided to the National Post, of 866 positive tests from Sept. 1 to Sept. 28, 65 per cent required 30 or fewer cycles to detect viral genes in the sample, while 35 per cent required 30 to 40 cycles. Roughly 16 per cent needed 35 to 40.  The data doesn’t account for all positive tests, and only involves tests conducted by Public Health Ontario."</p>

        <p>Interesting as I would presume the labs outside of PHO are probably winging it even more.
I've read 24 and under is a good CT.</p>

        <p>Yes these articles are saying either 30 max or 25 max. But even at Fauci's 35 max, Toronto is WAAAAAAY over.</p>

        <p>Has this article circulated yet in this sub? https://archive.vn/Uq49g</p>
<p>Basically even with a specificity of 99.8, that can still mean a very high false positive rate if there is a low prevalence of the virus in a population.</p>
