    <strong>There should be a new word for people not taking the vaccin instead of anti-vaxxer.</strong>
    <p><p>Most people I know who don't take this covid vaccin including myselve have been vaccinated for all sorts of other viruses. Makes no sense that these people are called anti-vaxxers while they trust all other sorts of vaccins. </p>
<p>The anti-vax stigma allready started a few years ago when there was no talk about covid. Labeling people as idiot anti vaxxers. Now covid is here, the exact same lable has been placed on people who won't take a covid vaccin. A lable that immidiately puts the negative context of the word anti-vaxxers on to people who won't take this new vaccin.. Even when they took all past vaccins they're ridiculed as stupid anti-vaxxers. </p>
<p>Makes no sense because this vaccin is different.
It would make more sense if the so called Anti-vaxxers would be labeled Anti-RNA-vaxxers or something in the line of this.</p>
<p>It makes no sense to put this non relevant lable on the wrong people. Since the anti-vax lable had become a well known lable to put on conspiracy-theorists, It does create great propaganda en pressure techniques for the media though.</p>
<p>Also people who believe in this new vaccin and are vaxxed themselves know this anti-vaxxers lable  is used to portray people who don't believe in it as stupid. They combine it with other recent stories that have been made fun of like 5g conspiracy stories and alien stuff... making it look like all people who don't get the new vaccin believe in all these conspiracy stories. The people doing this towards other people feel great about this, it makes them feel smarter than the person not getting the new covid vaccin.</p>
<p>These "bullies" just use this anti-vax term and combine them with other recent famous conspiracy stories to descredit your believes and make you feel stupid. Because of this the chances of getting vaxed are higher again. This is what the goverment wants, it's the most easy way that everyone will get vaxed. Splitting people through believes up and  putting themselves up against eachother. </p>
<p>This is just repetitive common history, putting people up against eachother to reach a specific goal.</p></p>

        <p>"Anti-vaxer", "Conspiracy theorist", "Denier", etc. - are all Meme words that work on the subconscious mind of people and are used to dismiss the real threats described by those Marked With The Meme Words.</p>
<p>Then the sheep will just say: <em>"Oh, you're just a conspiracy theorist." -</em> because they have been already programmed (by association) with the Meme word - and the easiest way to not break that program it's to deny it with the very program. So they used it again, "Oh, you're just a..."</p>
<p>It's basically a psychological trick to made people not investigate further and defuse the investigation at the very beginning.</p>
<p>Who will venture to be marked as "anti-vaxer" or "conspiracy theorist"? Not many. The shame. The pressure.</p>
<p>That's how also predictive programing works. By suggesting in movies, news, songs, etc. <em>events-that-are-yet-to-happen</em>, will attach to the subconscious minds of sheep, then when the real thing hits, the sheep will just play it off like <em>"oh, it's normal, you're just a conspiracy theorist"</em> - because sheep didn't realize their autonomous brain has already been conditioned with that predictive programing.</p>
<p>Welcome to the reality of deception.</p>
