    <strong>When has the medical establishment EVER pushed prevention?</strong>
    <p><p>In the documentary "Pink Ribbons Inc" that exposes breast cancer awareness merch, races, donations, etc they say that like only  2% of donations goes toward prevention. The rest goes to looking for treatments (as long as they are profitable). And scientists are absolutely not allowed to look for an actual cure. Their research will be defunded immediately if they even come close. The medical industry has always been like that. They don't want you to stop the problem before they can get paid to treat it.</p>
<p>Yet people believe that the strategy for Covid is prevention (with the vaccines). How many successful  medications have been suppressed so far? 5 or 6? The only thing they push are the vaccines. If they prevented sickness they'd be losing money. True prevention would include exercise, clean food, vitamin C, D, zinc, etc. But you can't talk about that. </p>
<p>Bottom line: They don't want sickness prevented. Listening to their advice will make you sicker.</p></p>

        <p>The business model of the medical system is the first true subscription based model: you get prescription of allopathic chemicals for most ailments, not to cure but to suppresss symptoms, for the rest of your life, until at 65, your pharmacist gets worried because you are getting a new prescription of drugs for the side-effects of the drugs you took for the side-effects of the drugs etc etc.</p>
<p>Life-tip: Stay away from any doctor or hospital, unless you have an urgent situation. Never take anything chronically, try to find solutions that are natural and non-toxic to the body. Eat well, hydrate, detox. The people that live the longest are often the ones without any medical records.</p>

        <p>I agree. I don't even think I believe in mainstream medicine anymore, except for trauma care (stitches, broken bone, etc). Stuff that if you don't get right away you will die. I just got done reading a book called "Mal(e) Practice". Despite the title, it's not a radical feminist book. It's from the 80's, written by a doctor exposing how women get manipulated into mastectomies, and other drastic procedures when some of them don't have cancer. It goes into popular surgeries and things that are profitable for Drs. The chapters on child birth are very interesting. He says most of the complications a mother can have are related to actions they take in the hospital. Even the position of laying on your back during childbirth is counterproductive &amp; causes more risk and pain. Also  how doctors suggest C-sections too frequently and say it's because of some risk, when it's more for the doctor's convenience. And because they can get more money for it.</p>
<p>Im Looking for some other books that are similar about the scams of modern medicine. I have that book "dead doctors don't lie". The title is a play on how doctors on average live to be about 56. Probably because they've been taught a bunch of bullshit and believe it and apply it to their own lives.</p>

        <p>Exactly -it's because big pharma is in the pocket of the government and their regulatory agencies, as well as the medical establishment. Their bottom line matters more than cheap, preventive treatment. For all the years doctors spend in medical school, very little time is spent on vaccines. They're assumed to be safe and effective and brushed over and NEVER are alternatives brought up. It's unbelievable.</p>

        <p>They don't get much education on vitamins either. I think people think doctors have an vast knowledge in every aspect of general health. Much of their practice in medicine is what the computer tells them to do and what the insurance covers nowadays. They are trying to do away with doctors making custom, individual based decisions and thinking outside of the box. They are just an "authority" that signs off on establishment protocols.</p>

        <p>We should hold him to that...... Although everything they push does the exact opposite. If they ever present some Vaccine that "cures cancer" you can bet that it causes it. It probably would be a vaccine too. I think we are going to be seeing more of them for things that have nothing to do with viruses. Depression, anxiety, PTSD, obesity.</p>

        <p>They have worked on experimental vaccines that are for stress, anxiety, PTSD. Possibly a DARPA program. I don't exactly remember, but what I left out is how they work. The "vaccine" goes into the part of the brain that is responsible for stress and eats it away so you're not stressed anymore. It's like a viral lobotomy. I think knowing about this is what makes me scared of the Covid vaccine. I worry about it specifically eating away at the centers that control spirituality. Or for it to make you more docile and controllable. Not that most of the public even needs help with that.</p>

        <p>I agree. When I was a kid they told us to eat right and exercise. But that was a long time ago. I wonder what they are teaching in schools now. Medicine is big business. They tend to give you all the pills you want, so you will keep coming back. If you are healthy, why would you need them. Someone has to pay for their expensive educations and fancy cars.</p>
