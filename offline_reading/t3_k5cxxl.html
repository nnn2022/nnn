    <strong>I wonder if all these Twitter healthcare martyrs know that their government specifically excluded them from the Families First Coronavirus Response Act sick leave protection, leaving it up to the employers...</strong>
    <p><p>Also excluded are other non-healthcare emergency responders.</p>
<p>Copied from the FAQs on the U.S. Department of Labor website:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Who is a “health care provider” who may be excluded by their employer from paid sick leave and/or expanded family and medical leave?</strong> <strong><em>[Updated to reflect the Department’s revised regulations which are effective as of the date of publication in the Federal Register.]</em></strong>For the purposes of defining the set of employees who may be excluded from taking paid sick leave or expanded family and medical leave by their employer under the FFCRA, a health care provider includes two groups.    </li>
</ol>
<p>This first group is anyone who is a licensed doctor of medicine, nurse practitioner, or other health care provider permitted to issue a certification for purposes of the FMLA.    </p>
<p>The second group is any other person who is employed to provide diagnostic services, preventive services, treatment services, or other services that are integrated with and necessary to the provision of patient care and, if not provided, would adversely impact patient care. This group includes employees who provide direct diagnostic, preventive, treatment, or other patient care services, such as nurses, nurse assistants, and medical technicians. It also includes employees who directly assist or are supervised by a direct provider of diagnostic, preventive, treatment, or other patient care services. Finally, employees who do not provide direct heath care services to a patient but are otherwise integrated into and necessary to the provision those services—for example, a laboratory technician who processes medical test results to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of a health condition—are health care providers.    </p>
<p>A person is not a health care provider merely because his or her employer provides health care services or because he or she provides a service that affects the provision of health care services. For example, IT professionals, building maintenance staff, human resources personnel, cooks, food services workers, records managers, consultants, and billers are not health care providers, even if they work at a hospital of a similar health care facility.    </p>
<p>To minimize the spread of the virus associated with COVID-19, the Department encourages employers to be judicious when using this definition to exempt health care providers from the provisions of the FFCRA. For example, an employer may decide to exempt these employees from leave for caring for a family member, but choose to provide them paid sick leave in the case of their own COVID-19 illness.
2. <strong>Who is an emergency responder?</strong>For the purposes of Employees who may be excluded from Paid Sick Leave or Expanded Family and Medical Leave by their Employer under the FFCRA, an emergency responder is anyone necessary for the provision of transport, care, healthcare, comfort and nutrition of such patients, or others needed for the response to COVID-19. This includes but is not limited to military or national guard, law enforcement officers, correctional institution personnel, fire fighters, emergency medical services personnel, physicians, nurses, public health personnel, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, emergency management personnel, 911 operators, child welfare workers and service providers, public works personnel, and persons with skills or training in operating specialized equipment or other skills needed to provide aid in a declared emergency, as well as individuals who work for such facilities employing these individuals and whose work is necessary to maintain the operation of the facility. This also includes any individual whom the highest official of a State or territory, including the District of Columbia, determines is an emergency responder necessary for that State’s or territory’s or the District of Columbia’s response to COVID-19.   </p>
<p>To minimize the spread of the virus associated with COVID-19, the Department encourages employers to be judicious when using this definition to exempt emergency responders from the provisions of the FFCRA. For example, an employer may decide to exempt these employees from leave for caring for a family member, but choose to provide them paid sick leave in the case of their own COVID-19 illness.</p>
<p>Normally I would say I hope people read this and realize daddy government doesn't actually give a shit about you, but I am certain anyone who reads this and is in denial will knee-jerk reply with an "Orange Man Bad, new guy gonna save us."</p>
<p>Also, I know this isn't the best flair, but "Daddy Government Loves Me" wasn't available, ha.</p>
<p>Edit: Added TLDR: The Families First Coronavirus Response Act has been touted as this amazing law that was put into place to protect people's income and jobs if they need to take off to quarantine themselves, care for a family member quarantining, and extended paid FMLA for covid-related child care (i.e. the child cannot attend school because of covid-related closures). Healthcare providers, military, law enforcement, emergency responders, and other professions listed above are excluded from this benefit and are subject to their employers mercy.</p></p>

I find this so ironic given how much we're being told that we need to protect our healthcare workers.</p>

        <p>Oh ya that’s complete BS. They’re just gonna use this to take the few leave days we actually have. Just like I’ve been working overtime since the pandemic started and have yet to see a dime.</p>

        <p>Or fire you if you need to take care of your kid because their school is closed and you can't get childcare (hopefully you have a decent employment contract). But let's clap in the streets, that <em>totally</em> makes up for the blatant middle finger the government is giving these people.</p>
