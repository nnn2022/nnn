    <strong>Employers Requiring Vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>So I finally got the call that I have been expecting for some time. The controller of my company asked me what my vaccination status is (I am not vaccinated). I wanted to tell her it’s a private matter / none of her business but I failed under pressure and told her (for some reason) that I had a negative reaction to the first vaccine dose and am on the fence about getting the second dose. I thought it would buy me some time. She kept pushing me for more information before asking if I would wear a mask in the office if I did not plan on getting the second dose. Everyone else in my company is vaccinated (small office). So I asked her who the mask would be protecting? I started this job in April and have been working remotely aside from a few days of on-site training. The role I’m performing does not require me to be in the office, but she is convinced that there is some sort of intangible collaboration that occurs when everyone is the the office, and she is pushing for a full return. I knew this moment would come and I am already disappointed in how I’ve handled myself. For starters, I should have recorded the call, and I shouldn’t have lied to her. I want to keep this job and stay working remotely due to transportation issues. Really my only leverage is they can’t find anyone to interview for open positions and I am already trained. I also know several coworkers with more tenure will be refusing to return to the office. Beyond my frustration, any advice on how best to handle this would be appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>Find a new job.  If they're going to push you on this (which is completely illegal), they will push you on other things (likely also illegal).  Ask yourself if you really want to be working for them.</p>

        <p>Definitely don’t lie about it. Just don’t say things that make you come off as a “insane covid denier” for sure..
Just be respectful and stay under the radar. I wear my mask at work. Under my nose, but it keeps everyone off my ass about it</p>

        <p>Ask her (in writing) to put any medical requests from the company in writing. This is best done in response to an email from your boss (or in follow-up to the original emailed meeting request). Maybe also ask for the company to provide the peer-reviewed safety and efficacy studies that the company consulted and used as the basis in order to decide on this policy. The burden of proof is on them.</p>
