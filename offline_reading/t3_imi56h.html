        <p>I'm so sick of this bullshit! I just want this to be over, but the fucking press blocks any legitimate info, if it doesn't fit their "doom and gloom" "lockdownforever" "sAvE lIVeS!" narrative!</p>

        <p>This is an interesting take on a serious issue in science. As a quick comment, though, it's interesting to see Ioannidis in the group you've mentioned, since his (probably) best-known article, and certainly the most cited, is “Why Most Published Research Findings are False." You'd certainly hope he knows how to build a study or a metastudy with the proper statistical power, but he would probably be the first to tell you that others do not.</p>
<p>There certainly is a problem when hot science topics lead to a rush of research that may or may not be properly analyzed or conducted but nonetheless fuels policy. </p>
<p>Imagine being the editor of JAMA or Lancet and receiving tomorrow a couple of submissions claiming rabies has gone airborne (there's been suggestion of this in the past, but it was explainable by other means). This would be a game-changer; even Ebola doesn't have the kill rate rabies does, and rabies is found all over the world, so it would be a public health nightmare when it gets to the media and causes a panic. Knowing what you do about spurious studies and their statistical analysis, do you publish the studies and let the chips fall where they may, or do you hold off and hope for more data, or better data? </p>
<p>What would make people worry less about censorship in scientific publication, I think, would be evidence that studies that reported greater incidence or severity of COVID-19 had also been rejected or held for want of better data. Caution in publishing findings that have major effects on society and public policy is a good thing, but it should be caution across the board.</p>

        <p>A lot of the stuff on /r/covid19 is preprinted, in other words printed without peer review.  The peer review is ongoing obviously, but I think it gives a distorted idea of the science because it's publishing everything and not just those things that would be printed in normal times.</p>

        <p>Random bit of info but rabies isn't found all over the world. There are countries entirely free of it! Now if it became airborne and started passing human to human that way that wouldn't last long and it would actually be an emergency. </p>
<p>If those studies on airborne rabies passed peer review then yes they should be published. Publishing then means other independent scientists can do further studies that will either dispute or support the theory, and then more studies will be done on top of those. That's why there are studies about airborne rabies transmission published from years ago going back decades to I think the latest are in the 2000s - nothing much came of them as you know. Science shouldn't be censored if it meets the necessary standards for publication. The issue is studies being put out right now do not meet the standards of before, and all sorts of rubbish is being preprinted and even peer reviewed.</p>

        <p>In subtle forms, this has been going on for a lot longer.  Worse than that, there is even a bias in the <em>funding</em> of scientific projects.  Basically, your grant is not going to get funded unless it supports the research agenda of NIH/NSF/MRC/etc.  These agendas are most certainly set from above by committees you've never heard of.</p>

        <p><em>"But the outrage propagated by social media is a force of its own, and  destroys any intelligent discourse, civil or uncivil. Once the outrage  gets going, platforms for academic discourse censor and the discourse  just doesn’t happen."</em></p>
<p><em>" have been blocked unfairly in the peer-review process"</em></p>
<p><em>“We’ve found it difficult to publish our work in mainstream journals,”</em></p>
<p>You have pointed out the fault in your hypothesis. You mourn a lack of "Academic Discourse" on Social Media and claim that "<em>the outrage propagated by social media"</em> has caused these studies to be blocked from being published in Medical Journals.  You go on to fault the Peer Review Process for the studies that support your biases not being published in Journals.</p>
<p>"<em>outrage propagated by social media" has no effect on whether a study is published in a Medical Journal.</em> "Academic Discourse" at this level does not take place on Social Media. It is the realm of people much more knowledgeable and Highly educated in Virology than those espousing their analysis of this virus on Social Media.</p>
<p>Peer Review is rigorous process judged by panels of knowledgeable and Highly educated experts in the medical and scientific fields and if these studies that do not meet it's criteria they have critical flaws. You are upset because studies that support your biases are rightfully rejected by Peer Review. You are not knowledgeable enough to judge the validity of these studies.</p>
