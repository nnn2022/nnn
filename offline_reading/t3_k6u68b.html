    <strong>I’m not an anti masker or anti vaccine but something is still weird about all of this...</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve never been anti-mask or social distance but Overall this pandemic has really fucked with me. I don’t want to stop living my life (working, going to school, visiting family and friends) I don’t want to be in fear everyday when I go out in public. 
I have traveled the most this year and if anyone would get the virus it would be me. But I’m still primarily healthy and I’ve never taken a corona test. Like a lot of you I’m nervous about this vaccine, especially when I read that it may cause infertility. I’m no way anti vaccination but I’m still not going to be first in line to get the corona virus vaccine. 
My mental health has been so bad this year and I’m basically on the verge of failing and getting kicked out of my college program. I still love my job where I get to have true human interaction and I get to live with my long distance bf because of mandatory online school. I honestly wish this could all end, but everyday it seems worse and worse. </p>
<p>Love, scared and whiny little girl</p></p>

        <p>i don't think any of us are anti-mask/vax .</p>
<p>i think if any of this were legitimate we would do what needed to be done.</p>
<p>but it's all fake, death rate year after year is unchanged , telling me this is your garden variety flu. </p>
<p>i gave the the fist couple week and hunkered down. bodies weren't piling up and all media outlets were reciting from the same script.</p>

        <p>Right?! If this was truly the deadly pandemic being squawked about on the news 24/7.... I’m pretty sure we would KNOW sick people.  We would know people who had died besides Aunt Bessie and Uncle Carl in their 70s or 80s so sadly taken from the earth too soon who were in PERFECT health since chemo ended 2 months ago. Instead I’ve heard of gobs of positive CASES, young and old alike, some with symptoms some without and every single person recovered. Our next door neighbors and most family members would have been sick or are sick for fucks’ sake!!!!</p>

        <p>Ahem... my parents DIED from this virus and my mother was healthier than I am right now.</p>
<p>My dad? Poster child for pre-ex's so I have to say that I was not surprised when this VASCULAR virus was exposed as attacking his coronary artery bypass and it killed him.</p>
<p>Mom? She would not have died if this was 'just another flu or cold' like you idjits are trying to push here.</p>
<p>CoVid-19 is a serious illness for a portion of the populace. Full stop there. It lands them on ventilators and serious sickens a lot of healthy people.</p>

        <p>Died WITH or died FROM the virus? And for two people that you claim to be healthy at the time, with a 99.7% chance of recovery from it, you're either lying or extremely unlikely. Sorry that I'm not sounding very sympathetic but I guess I'm just starting to use the same sort of language the doomers use towards us.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry you lost your parents to a virus.  I lost both of mine to poor health decisions for their lifetime.  My father in law died of shingles....another virus. Not once did I ever look around at everyone and expect 1) pity or sympathy 2) lay blame or most especially 3) Want the whole world to shut down and mask up. </p>
<p>Illness and accidents happen.  Some people will die of flu, shingles, car accidents or ill health.  More will from from suicide, medical mistakes or maybe even murder. I disagree with how this planned Scamdemic is being handled and ruining more lives than the virus is taking.</p>

        <p>You yourself stated that you think they wouldn't have died if no ventilator was used.</p>
<p>On a side note, scrolling through your comments you appear to think that the kind of food one eats is irrelevant to whether you get obese and that it is mostly down to genetics. You seem to have no idea of the human body whatsoever. Which is why I find your statements questionable.</p>

        <p>That “Ahem...” at the beginning made me disregard everything you said after that. I don’t think someone apparently in mourning would be so snarky and condescending. I’ve had a lot of health problems in my past, I had leukemia twice just to name the big one. First time, I was given a 40-50% chance to survive. Second time, about 20%. Sorry if I’m not phased by a virus with a 99%+ survival rate.</p>

        <p>Although some people call masks “muzzles” which seems like they would be anti-mask either way. I personally think masks are useless but if people want to wear them to feel safer then they can. N95 masks are the only ones that are gonna keep things out. Not these flimsy fabric masks everyones wearing. It’s like pulling your t-shirt over your nose.</p>

        <p>I agree, masks should be optional. But calling a simple mask a muzzle is absurd and makes the rest of us look stupid. A muzzle forcefully keeps the jaws of an animal shut so it can’t bite. Masks don’t keep people from moving their jaw.</p>

        <p>muzzles also make the animal quiet, more docile, more easily led, and less perceptive.  are you pretending to not understand why people greedy for power and money would prefer subjects who don't bite, don't wander, and don't ask questions?</p>

        <p>Why are you pretending masks are the only thing they are doing to us? I think the mandatory lockdowns and mandatory closing of small businesses is worse. Ya masks are dumb and it pisses me off when they’re mandatory but masks are so trivial. If I had to pick I rather wearing a stupid mask than be in house arrest and I think most people would agree.</p>

        <p>I’m in the same boat, and you’re not a whiney girl you’re a rational person who can tell when things don’t add up. This is truly a terrifying time but I’ve found this sub has helped a lot, so stick around awhile. If you’re anything like me you’re in a small town with small town mentality and people who are cowering at this ‘virus.’ It’s best to remember that those people don’t and won’t ever think for themselves. It’s a gift in itself that you can. But you still sound like you’ve had a good year with travelling and being able to live with your boyfriend. Hold on to those things dearly and be grateful for what you still have. This next year is gonna be crazy but I have a good feeling about it. Every single day more and more people are wakening up and you also have to remember that a lot of ‘people’ on social media spouting shit about this are bots. All of us in this sub are there for each other, including you! So keep your head up, stay positive and let’s not let these bastards win!</p>

        <p>The thing about the vaccine for me is that they are constantly trying to bribe or coerce us to take it </p>
<p>There’s news articles like “ restaurants and concerts might not allow unvaccinated people in” or “ employers might make the vaccine mandatory “</p>
<p>And then there’s bribes like “ would you take the vaccine for a $1500 stimulus check”</p>
<p>And then stunts like Bush, Clinton and Obama taking the vaccine on TV</p>
<p>We shouldn’t need coercion or bribery</p>

        <p>The more you learn the more daunting it all seems, I know. Just try to be grateful for anything good in your life. Hold on to that feeling, and try to seek out joyful moments... you can create them. And if you're not feeling it, fake it until you make it.  </p>
<p>We don't know what the future holds, just stay away from the vaccine and try to be optimistic for the future. There are still a lot of good people out there that are going to fight against this.</p>

        <p>When there was a case or two of Ebola that invaded into the US, back in 15, during the Obama era, it was handled quickly, and the story died.  None of the patients did.  Ebola is 1000 times worse, and very communicable, but kills at around 50%, only in the poorest parts of Africa.  Spread happens, but is limited, Bc it kills the infected so quickly, it doesn’t have as much opportunity for transmission.  </p>
<p>COVId is not Ebola.  And reasonable, rational thinking, died in 2020.</p>
