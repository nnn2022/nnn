    <strong>Salaried, WFH health bureaucrats are calling for a "hard lockdown". It's official - the psychopaths are in charge!</strong>
    <p><p>They locked down everything except for grocery stores last time, promising us it would "save Easter and our summer". Here we are being fed the same bullshit to "save Christmas"!</p>
<p>What are they going to do this time? Weld us in our homes, Wuhan-style?, Shoot violators on sight?</p>
<p>These people are so drunk on their own power that they don't even live in the same world as the rest of us anymore!</p>

        <p>The supreme irony of it all is the people pushing these restrictions on everyone, are for the most part, "champagne socialists". They literally screw over their own voting base, who smile like the village idiot, and say "please, sir, may I have another???".</p>
<p>Same applies for Globalism, mass immigration, outsourcing, and Green austerity policies...</p>

        <p>Guys. Real talk. Why in the world would politicians implement lockdowns that: </p>
<p>A) are bad for the economic activity 
B) hurt their chances for re-election </p>

<p>Nobody likes lockdowns. Again: NOBODY LIKES LOCKDOWNS. Lockdowns are something that we have to do because we don‚Äôt have a vaccine for this virus, and we don‚Äôt want to overwhelm the ER/ICU departments with COVID patients (which would prevent non-COVID patients from being admitted)</p>
<p>Why is it so hard to understand?</p>

        <p>The ‚ÄúGreat Reset‚Äù is not a policy. It‚Äôs not a plan. It‚Äôs not a framework. It has no legislation backing. Or resources committed  to it. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs a mental exercise coming from the World Economic Forum. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs not coming from the UN. It‚Äôs not coming from the Federal Reserve. It‚Äôs not coming from any organization that has the means to implement any of its ideas.</p>
<p>The World Economic Forum is basically a think tank. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs like saying that the local high school debate club is deciding where the Federal reserve is going to set its rates next quarter.</p>

<p>Specious argument, Mr. Zissou.</p>
<p>You're trying to argue that we should assume that the politicians are making a rational choice, because they want to be reelected. But if you get enough people to adopt that shaky assumption, then the politicians will get re-elected whether their actions caused needless economic pain, or not.</p>
<p>Your argument is a piece of sophistry created to eliminate the accountability of elected officials for the bad choices they make - and how fascinating that you begin your argument with an implicit assumption that politicians can't make bad choices.</p>
<p>That particular assumption leads to cults of personality and totalitarian rule, when embraced with enough confidence by enough people.</p>

        <p>&rt; A) are bad for the economic activity</p>
<p>So that they can go whining to Uncle Joe and get bailout money.  Not sure about the other prime offenders like CA and MI, but I know here in NY, Cuomo had already spent the state into millions of dollars of debt even before COVID.  This is the excuse he needs to get out of that hole.</p>
<p>&rt;B) hurt their chances for re-election</p>
<p>Idiot leftist voters can and will vote in favor of eternal lockdowns</p>
