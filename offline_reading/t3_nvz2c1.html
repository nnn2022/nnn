    <p><p>The national institute of health funded gain of function research at the Wuhan institute of virology.</p>
<p>https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006698</p>
<p>This article, peer reviewed and from the Wuhan institute of virology, lists the National Institute of Health under its funding section.</p>
<p>Under the materials an methods section of the study, it details the genetic modification of coronaviruses to create chimera strains.</p>
<p>“Construction of recombinant viruses Recombinant viruses with the S gene of the novel bat SARSr-CoVs and the backbone of the infectious clone of SARSr-CoV WIV1 were constructed using the reverse genetic system described previously 23. The fragments E and F were re-amplified with primer pairs...”</p>
<p>“The other fragments and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) were prepared as described previously. Then the two prepared spike DNA fragments were separately inserted into BAC with Es, Fs and other fragments. The correct infectious BAC clones were screened. The chimeric viruses were rescued as described previously [23].”</p>
<p>This specific project involved making chimeric viruses (genetically modified) to study infectivity.</p>
<p>The article then details how pathogenesis was tested for these strains, under the sections “Determination of virus replication in Vero E6 cells by plaque assay” and “Determination of virus replication in HeLa cells expressing human ACE2 by quantitative RT-PCR” in the materials and methods section.</p>
<p>Also to mention, these are bat coronaviruses being tested for human replication, thus it tests for an increase of host range.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gain_of_function_research?wprov=sfti1 
I’ll use the Wikipedia gain of function research definition since it is likely to be widely accepted.</p>
<p>By this definition “Gain of function research (GoFR) is a term used to describe any field of medical research that alters an organism or disease in a way that increases pathogenesis, transmissibility, or host range (the types of hosts that a microorganism can infect). “</p>
<p>Since this study does alter the virus, it studies pathogenesis, transmissibility, and the increase of host range, then this is gain of function research.</p>
<p>By all accounts, this means that the national institute of health under Anthony Fauci at the time funded gain of function research at the Wuhan institute of virology.</p></p>

        <p>I think Fauci knew exactly what was going on there, which is that a virus would deliberately be released.</p>
<p>Fauci probably wanted to regain fame after he had slipped into almost complete obscurity over the previous 30 years or so.</p>

        <p>imo... the US sent this ridiculous experimentation offshore for plausible deniability. gain of function research was a thing in the US until i think 2019. so here we have a situation where the US can say, "its a chinese thing.." and the chinese (*if smart enough to wriggle out of this one) can blame the US</p>
