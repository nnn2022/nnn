    <strong>Went on a stickering sortie. Playgrounds were full of people ignoring covid closure signs and tape.</strong>
    <p><p>I went on a stickering sortie today.   I recommend it.  It's great for your mental health to feel like you are doing <em>something</em> to resist the totalitarian hysteria publically, even if it's small and anonymous.   (There are some good sticker examples and links in previous threads here.)</p>
<p>The most significant thing was that the playgrounds I went through and past were pretty much full of people congregating including parents with their kids on the play structures.   They were just ignoring all the signage and yellow caution tape.   Teenagers are just over all of this nonsense.   They were in groups with pizza and stuff, just chilling like normal.   </p>
<p>I've also noticed that people have been tearing down the caution tapes pretty quickly and the signs have been disappearing over time.</p>
<p>CA Bay Area, in case you were wondering.   So there is hope.   The Resistance is out there -- they just aren't on social media I guess.</p>
<p>Also, teenagers see more clearly than adults in a lot of cases.   There's hope for the future.</p></p>

        <p>I've been tearing down "covid" signs at all the parks whenever I can. I throw them in their proper place; the garbage. </p>
<p>When they have it locked behind plastic/glass I just tape my own posters over theirs.</p>
<p>The guy who has to go around hanging that crap up and putting up the tape agrees with me, I caught him removing some tape a couple months ago. He is tired of this bullshit.</p>

        <p>I went to a NJ shore town last weekend for several days. Saw hundreds and hundreds of people on the beach and on the streets... only saw maybe 10 masks, at least three on people with likely comorbidities.  People were wearing them inside stores, of course, and while <em>waiting</em> for outdoor dining, but that was about it. </p>
<p>It was heartening.</p>

        <p>Went to a small town (don't want them reported, so won't be specific). Business owners did not require face diapers. There were signs to pretend just in case a govt goon decided to visit. But it was GREAT. We went fishing and talked to people and smiled at each other. Went into a little shop on the main street, and the owner GREETED us, sans mask! It was delightful. We chatted and browsed and didn't even mention what I feel like is always at the surface these days, at least for me; have you fallen for the bullshit? It was just so nice. Really made our day.</p>

        <p>This is a good idea. I don't know what postboxes are like in the US, but over here it's also fun to put big googly eyes on the postbox. Then when you post something into the slot you feel like he is actually eating the letters.</p>
<p>People have actually fitted sort of stretchy woollen hats on top a well, it's mental.</p>
