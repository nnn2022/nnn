        <p>It’s the pushing that gets me.  If it was just a case of ‘we’ve created a vaccine now and we’re not threatening to remove rights from the unvaccinated, we’re not censoring anyone who questions them, and we’re not protecting pfizer from legal accountability, so feel free to get the shot if you want the shot’, I wouldn’t be worried.</p>

        <p>if you track 11M people, odds are some number of them will die in a four-week period. let's say that number is X. if you give 11M people the vaccine, the number of them who die in the four-week period following vaccination is still expected to be X if there's no causal relationship between the vaccine and death. this is why you wouldn't assert the existence of a causal relationship between "vaccine" and "death" just because one follows the other.</p>
<p>now, let's say that instead of giving people the vaccine, we're giving them COVID. it so happens that if you do that, you'll find that a much greater number of people than "X" die in that four-week period following a positive COVID test. and an even greater number are hospitalized. that observation, <em>together</em> with the observations of the virus's actual effects on people, let's us make the jump from "A follows B" to "B causes A." neither of those two pieces of evidence  exist for vaccines, so it is not sound to infer a causal relationship even though one event might follow another. </p>
<p>in other words, those saying "you can't infer that A causes B just because B follows A" are not saying "it can never be true that A causes B if B follows A." </p>
<p>In fact, if you look at a different time frame—say, eight to twelve weeks after vaccination—the group that gets the vaccine actually has way fewer deaths than "X." the vaccine is not just safe for 99% of people, it is safe for everyone that does not have an allergy to the vaccine, which is about 99.9998% of people (and even if you're one of the unlucky few, vaccine allergies are treatable on-site; it's why they keep you for observation for 15 minutes). </p>
<p>i got the vaccine, my pregnant wife got the vaccine, and we feel great. we're looking forward to socializing with our extended family, all of whom have also now been vaccinated, indoors and without masks, in just a few days (it has been enough time since everyone's first dose for the vaccines to be effective).</p>

<p>No, it actually does, because the numbers aren't random, they're from controlled studies that are specifically designed to test whether a new therapy is effective and safe, and from observable facts about the general populace that have taken the vaccine and not. </p>
<p>I included that I took it and felt fine because that's often persuasive to people who have doubts. The vaccines will save your life or someone you love. But whatever, if you don't want to take it, it will be sad when you get someone you love killed because they were dumb enough to listen to you.</p>

<p>&rt;Each study group included 596,618 persons. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for the study outcomes at days 14 through 20 after the first dose and at 7 or more days after the second dose was as follows: for documented infection, 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40 to 51) and 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95); for symptomatic Covid-19, 57% (95% CI, 50 to 63) and 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98); for hospitalization, 74% (95% CI, 56 to 86) and 87% (95% CI, 55 to 100); and for severe disease, 62% (95% CI, 39 to 80) and 92% (95% CI, 75 to 100), respectively. Estimated effectiveness in preventing death from Covid-19 was 72% (95% CI, 19 to 100) for days 14 through 20 after the first dose. Estimated effectiveness in specific subpopulations assessed for documented infection and symptomatic Covid-19 was consistent across age groups, with potentially slightly lower effectiveness in persons with multiple coexisting conditions.</p>
<p>You're not a murderer if you get your family killed—murder requires an intent to kill. But with a safe and effective vaccine available, if the outcome of your influence is that they die of an easily preventable disease because they didn't get a vaccine, you would be morally responsible for that death.</p>

        <p>I've read the efficacy studies, I have no doubt the studies proved they work. What needs the citation is the "99.9998%" of people that will have no lasting issues. That's something you can't know because the research does not exist.</p>
<p>How would you feel if you encouraged someone to take the mRNA treatment and a year from now they develop a serious disease or illness resulting directly from it? Unless that person is already on the way out, it's completely avoidable because covid will pose no serious risk.</p>
<p>That's my issue, we've all been told we're going to die and it's a death sentence. Aside from the news channels, everything else screams the opposite. The "data" from the government in my country (and most others) is still completely opaque regarding anything important.</p>

        <p>&rt; What needs the citation is the "99.9998%" of people that will have no lasting issues</p>
<p>The portion of people who have an allergic reaction to the vaccine is 1/500,000. That's where that 99.9998% number comes from.</p>
<p>&rt;How would you feel if you encouraged someone to take the mRNA treatment and a year from now they develop a serious disease or illness resulting directly from it?</p>
<p>I'm confident that won't happen because there's zero reason to think this would happen and a lot of reasons to think it wouldn't happen. At the very least, the risk they die of covid in the next year is dramatically higher than the risk the vaccine uniquely causes some wild symptom in a year that lies dormant for at least the first 8 months, so even in the insane counterfactual where that's a risk, the known benefit still outweighs the risk of harm.</p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines are a lipid encasing mRNA that instructs your cell to make the spike protein. The lipid helps the mRNA get into your cells, then is broken down by the body. The mRNA instructs your cells to make the spike protein that looks like the Covid-19 spike protein, then is broken down by the body. Your body responds to the spike protein expressed at the cell's surface, and the spike protein is then broken down by the body. Only the immune response remains. </p>
<p>Is it possible that covid-19 antibodies generated by your own body in response to the virus (or the vaccine) cause problems in a year? I guess so, but coronaviruses in general have been around a long time and aren't known to cause auto-immune disorders years later. Even if it did, everyone who gets covid is going to have the exact same problem, and potentially worse problems as they generate other antibodies that attack more than just the spike protein. </p>
<p>The problem we face societally is that if there are too many freeriders—that is, people like you who overestimate the risk of harm from vaccines and refuse to take them—then we societally increase the odds that deadlier variants arise as we fail to quash the disease. </p>
<p>Even if you reject all of this, consider this: policymakers think the same way I've laid out here. If there are too many freeriders, vaccination programs are much more likely to be mandatory for participation in many forms of public life (school, work, etc.), and if you don't get a vaccine, you marginally increase the odds that your friends and family will end up vaccinated through a mandatory program. But, if there are few enough freeriders that we can quash the disease by other means, that won't happen, and you reduce the number of overall freeriders by getting a shot. In either paradigm—vaccines dangerous or vaccines not dangerous—the choice that results in the greatest benefit/least harm to your family is for you to get a vaccine.</p>

        <p>Lots of words, same citation still needed. I don't need a lecture in how spike proteins work, or your political views. Being "confident it won't happen" is not scientific 🤡 </p>
<p>Your idea of "people like me" and my family being into forced vaccination just pushes me further into relying on my immune system. I'll survive, if "people like you" die that's too bad I guess.</p>

        <p>Dude I gave you four journal articles on safety and efficacy and told you where my 99.9998% figure came from—the 1/500000 people who experience allergic reactions. </p>
<p>Why would mandatory vaccination “push you further into relying on your immune system”? Why on earth do you think the virus—which actually is documented to have long-lasting effects in a substantial number of people it doesn’t kill—is safer for you than the vaccine? And why would mandatory vaccination change the answer to that question?</p>
<p>Believe whatever you want, but it’s absurd to claim that you’re just following scientific reasoning. Nobody is going to “force” you to get vaccinated; you just won’t get to do things like go to work or school or travel on airplanes if you don’t do it.</p>
<p>Will you survive? Probably! Will everyone in your family survive? Not as likely if your over 65s are still around.</p>

<p>&rt;During December 21, 2020–January 10, 2021, monitoring by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System detected 10 cases of anaphylaxis after administration of a reported 4,041,396 first doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (2.5 cases per million doses administered).

<p>lol. i gave you proof, and i am following proven science. </p>

        <p>Even if you ignore the observations of the virus's actual effects on people and look only at the death rate for people who test positive, it is much much higher than the general population.  It's much higher than the death rate for the same number people over an entire year (at least until the death rate increased in 2020).  That is evidence of causation, while the death rate following vaccination is not.</p>
<p>You're right that individual experiences aren't that significant, but statistics are significant.</p>

        <p>Oh I feel ok about the PCR tests now. I had an annoying weekend, I took one of the rapid antigen tests, they give you results in an hour, the kind I think the White House had used right before Trump got Covid, but my test came back positive for covid. I felt 100% fine, but I was worried because I had seen friends the weekend before, so I turned around and took two PCR's 24 hours apart, both negative. </p>
<p>It was going to be an even bigger issue because my girlfriend is a doctor, and because of the rapid test she was going to have to be put on quarantine for 20 days, no patients, nothing. But the PCR tests convinced the hospital that it was a false positive.</p>
