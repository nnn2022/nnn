        <p>We have had many years of the flu shot where people could have tried to make the flu shot mandatory but that discussion never really happened but now all of a sudden it's instantly normalized with little debate.  Very strange.</p>

        <p>It's not normalized, they want it to appear normalized.</p>
<p>That's how this regime operates. Using media and major corporations to give a false appearance of consensus.</p>

        <p>Good point.  That's been pretty obvious with the vaccine adoption rate and how they still were able to create the hype at the beginning where people were literally taking road trips to get it.</p>

        <p>Talking about the flu shot, that ruined my cousins life completely. She was a nurse and it left her bed bound and having to relearn how to walk and do basic things to care for herself. She was 32 when it happened. She has 3 young kids and today almost 5 years later is still on disability. Guess who doesnâ€™t give a flying fuck about what happened to her? The old hospital she use to work at. Are they helping pay her medical bills that have put her and her husband into outrageous debt? No. Do they even believe her? No. </p>
<p>If my boss wanted to make the jab mandatory I would make them sign an agreement that they are responsible for any negative health outcome from it and if I could no longer work, then I request my salary be paid in full until the day I die. </p>
<p>Im so thankful I work for myself holy hell there is no way Im getting that</p>
