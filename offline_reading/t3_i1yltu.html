    <strong>It's harder at this point to not wear a mask than to wear one.</strong>
    <p><p>My province implemented a mandatory (but unenforced) mask policy for indoor public spaces starting yesterday.</p>
<p>On Thursday maybe 10% of wore them, Friday 60%, and today near 100%. Nothing between Thursday and Saturday changed, the risk remains the same, we have two active cases total for almost one million people and those two are both travel related.</p>
<p>I had to go to the grocery store and I didn't wear one (since I don't own one) and it's a bizarre experience. So many nasty looks, so much guilt tripping from those you <em>have</em> to interact with, so much peer pressure, and this constant concern someone is going to start shit.</p>
<p>It makes one mildly anxious because you can see people looking at you in particular. If you used to blend into a crowd, you no longer do, you're the one person who stands out and people are at <em>best</em> indifferent to you.</p>
<p>It is legitimately harder to not wear a mask than to wear one. Wearing one poses no risk (physical, social, or otherwise) to you, everyone is okay with your choice. Not wearing one is now quite a different matter entirely.</p>
<p>This is crazy and I really don't see how we're ever going to revert back from this. It's easier to implement these things that it is to roll them back. Everyone has bought into it and soon enough they'll be used to it, it'll just be second nature.</p></p>

        <p>I called a local business this morning because I was thinking of going in later today. I told the woman that I didn't wear a mask and her reply was, "Oh,sweetie, we aren't enforcing that. Don't even worry about it."</p>
<p>Calling ahead, and making sure to get the name of the person I'm talking to, has been working well so far.</p>

        <p>Oh no prob. It occurred to me after two experiences in one week of being yelled at for not wearing a mask. It really wore me out to stand up for myself like that, tbh. Caused a lot of anxiety. This calling ahead thing at least lets me know when I DON'T have to worry about anything. At least not from employees and owners. Other customers are the unknown, lol.</p>

        <p>True.  I try not to engage them because there is no argument, no information, and nothing that could possibly happen to ever make them want to end this bullshit.   These loud doomers hated their life before covid and they are enjoying wearing masks, staying home, and living off of taxpayers.   They are enjoying telling strangers how much science they know cuz science science me am scientist cuz me watch tv.  That is the bottom line.</p>

        <p>I have given in mainly because of my anxiety. I don't want to have to deal with confrontation with a Maskhole. I know I should stand up more... But I just can't right now. </p>
<p>But my mask is a single layer of very breathable material. If it was a lighter color you would totally be able to see through it. I also have the nose wire bent to keep it off of my face. </p>
<p>Even then, I've changed all of my routines. My husband calls every night to see if I need him to stop anywhere since I refuse to go anywhere but dr appointments at the moment. </p>
<p>I'm hoping the mandates lighten up more because I've promised my kids some trips to the zoo and some museums... If we have to mask we'll have to experiment to make it bearable.</p>

        <p>I completely understand how you're feeling. I get a pit in my stomach thinking about going out. There increased anxiety only makes breathing in a mask harder. My husband is going out on my behalf too. I've decided to get a mask with words on it to show I don't see a need to wear one for the occasions I do venture out. I can't imagine dealing with this messed up world without my husband being supportive.</p>

        <p>My governor just passed a mask mandate with a $200 fine for noncompliance.   I haven't been masking, but it looks like I'll have to...I cannot afford $200.  So I'm wearing one of those beak-faced plague doctor masks-- it covers my face, so no one can complain.</p>

        <p>So true. If you looked around my neighborhood most nights, you wouldn't know anything was going on. People hanging out with each other, kids playing, etc. I just avoid going to stores more than I need to now because it's so damn aggravating. But I've discovered I tend to enjoy swimming and hiking more than wandering around Target or Home Depot.</p>

        <p>Personal discipline, yes. Everyone should understand, to put it in weird terms, every action has an equal but opposite reaction. This really applies to societal responsibilities too. Every bad financial decision one makes, could have been something that reaped great rewards later. In US schools, they do not emphasize this. I don’t know a soul that took an economics class in HS, myself included.</p>

        <p>What may seem like "dirty looks" may be envious looks.   You may also have never paid attention to people looking at you before and now you're watching for it.</p>
<p>I think a lot of people are not okay with the choice but feel the way you do -- they don't want to get crap.    And so everyone sees everyone else wearing a mask and assumes they are the only one not okay with it....</p>
<p>Anyway my point is that if you can endure the psychological discomfort of not wearing a mask, the upside is that the groupthink is cracked open a little and people like you feel a little bit of support.    It's tough though.</p>

        <p>Today is Saturday but I needed 2 documents notarized for a family emergency. I called my new bank and asked them if I could use the drive thru so I don't have to go in the lobby. The agent said to just call when I got to the parking lot and somebody would come outside for me! I had to wait a bit but the notary teller came out in her mask and sweetly got the job done. I told her I would five star review them on google reviews, and I did. The rare times I have to deal with local businesses, including mmj dispensaries, I call ahead and request curb service. I don't say why. I just ask for it. I can tell the reps ENJOY stepping outside for the few minutes. And they enjoy being thanked profusely, too. :)</p>

        <p>No, the economy was doing just fine before the media went full retard on a virus and people like you started demanding special treatment for it. You're literally advocating for a new normal in a sub that's advocating against it</p>

        <p>I refuse to wear a mask and I make them come outside...both ways resisting the new normal. My result is that the bank agent and any other employee of any place will become familiar with me as a human being, and may feel comfortable enough over time to ditch the stupid mask while "serving" me. Getting them to step outside of where most of the new normal is happening, in a sense more on my turf than theirs, is a subtle form of resistence, working their concessions in a way that their "followers" have opportunities to experience what it might be like if they chose the side they currently don't follow. Create a slippery slope for them to lose traction on, rather than go down theirs.</p>

        <p>I also refuse to wear a mask but I walk right into any establishment. If anyone in that establishment asks me to wear a mask or leave, I leave. They don't get my business and they never will again. </p>
<p>So far I have not been asked at all.</p>
<p>But I'm also not asking any of them to do anything different for me. Asking them to come outside to you is just accepting the new normal and it actually just makes you look afraid of a virus, so much so that you're actually pushing a new normal</p>

        <p>Could be. Thanks for more details. Towns tend to have their own vibes and pace, though, so your strategy may be great where you are, but where I am, in a small enough town where people can get on a first name basis with businesses, even really big ones, rather quickly, the people who refuse to enter and who stay mask free are seen as libertarian rather than fearful. </p>
<p>Another thing I do that rattles their cages is I garden the right of way storm ditch in front of my house. Most people just ask the city to come and mow theirs. I am replacing the gramoid culture with no maintenance ground covers. I live on a connector road so a big subdivision worth of traffic pass by every day. There I am down in that scary dirty ditch mask and glove free, even barefoot when the ants aren't too bad. I do it as a hobby, no other reason. I love dirt and have no fear of it. And my neighbors have no doubts because they have watched me do this for years. </p>
<p>Recently the foot traffic has increased. A few of the people passing by who wore masks last week aren't wearing them anymore. While I was sweeping the end of my driveway, unmasked to the dust, a girl passed by a few days ago who was always masked up before. This time, no mask, and she flashed me such a gorgeous happy smile and said hi like I was a favorite teacher or aunt. True story. Get em thinking for themselves one at a time in a nonconfrontational way. </p>
<p>Two weeks ago a rando neighbor came by while I was out there, a gal who has BLM signs and gets more for the asking. She wears a mask unless exercising. She asked me about invasive species and ended up following me around the whole property for a lesson in terrain theory. She did not ask to post any signs after that. I think that was her original objective. But here she found somebody walking the talk. </p>
<p>Different issue, but graciousness has its place in our city and proves to be the most effective way to win people over who have any potential at all. Not every city can boast this. Reason I moved here.</p>

        <p>Or that where you are, confrontation is the key, and where I am, setting examples and making friends with the kids who are just looking for a role model. Maybe one reason you feel the need to confront is that you live where people are anonymous and rude, like Houston TX. Nothing else seems to work in places like that.  I don't disagree with you at all about business not deserving your money.</p>
