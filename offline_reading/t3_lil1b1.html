    <strong>I've figured out the obsession with masks, and it finally all makes sense.</strong>
    <p><p>I've posted on here awhile ago regarding masks, and how it represents the principle of "Slactivism" at its finest. Again, slactivism is where people bandwagon certain movements that don't actually require any effort, in a way to fit in to some sort of narrative and make society think they're contributing to the greater good. BLM, for example. Important movement, but posting a black square does nothing except try to show other people that you're doing something. Want to make an impact? Donate money, use your voice and make some sort of statement, etc. Really, they're just displaying one of the less finer traits of humanity - conformity. But hey, makes those of us who can think a bit more critically stand out, right? So I guess it's not all bad all the time. Unfortunately, right now it kinda is. </p>
<p>Had a conversation with some friends last night regarding masks, and how they feel when people don't wear them, it's stupid, uneducated, and just plain selfish. I asked the question, "how do we know they're even effective?" To which the answer was, "well it just makes sense doesn't it?" </p>
<p>Now, I'll preface this all by saying I'm not one to walk into a grocery store and cause a scene by not wearing a mask. I follow the rules and I'm not here as a conspiracy theorist thinking that the government is out to track us and everything we do/say with microchips in the vaccine. I'm also one, though, to share my personal thoughts and opinions and respect that of others, so if someone feels that way about COVID, that's totally fair. I just hate how my opinions on masks, and how we'll never get back to normal life at this rate of fear/panic/conformity, is dismissed and taken as ridiculous. </p>
<p>Anyways, back to the point about masks. It's interesting how mandatory masks in public settings have done absolutely nothing to stop the spread of COVID. There is zero evidence to the contrary. Like, how are we supposed to even know that the masks are doing anything? Why is the argument "well it just makes sense, doesn't it?" the way we are shaping our behaviour through all of this? It's only a matter of time before some lunatic says we should all wear helmets when we leave our house, since it just makes sense. </p>
<p>What I've realized, though, is that mandatory masks is essentially a way for people to feel like they're doing the right thing, and that they're not to blame for the spread of COVID, despite no concrete evidence to the efficacy of their use. "Look at all the cases, stupid people not wearing masks." "It's so horrible the deaths in the long term care facilities, if only everyone wore masks." Newsflash: LTC facilities have some of the strictest requirements on mask wearing and restrictions. Deaths are still occurring, and cases continue to exist. Does wearing a mask make someone feel better about all this, despite it not doing anything at all? You bet it does. </p>
<p>Mask wearing seems eerily analogous to religion. It's something that has no scientific proof of its merit, but it helps people get through the tough times in life. Who would have thought the parallels would be so similar? Except at least with religion, you can choose which one you want to believe in. Mask wearing has become a religion that has been forced onto all of us - we were baptized without our consent, and there's no end in sight. I'm just going to go out and say this: Society will never return back to what it was before. And that's just so, so sad.</p></p>

        <p>Here's one thing I'll never understand no matter what. Wear a mask, who gives a fuck. But why virtue signal about it? Why change your profile photo to a pic of you in a mask? Why pretend like you <em>enjoy</em> wearing a mask, like it's the best thing ever! If people just begrudgingly threw them on and went about their business and admitted it was an inconvenience but "what can you do?" ... I'd have so much more respect for them than these insincere mask warriors who wear it like a fucking purple heart that they earned in a world war for valor. It's so fake, so fraudulent and so nauseating to me. I hate the times we live in that instagram has turned people into the fakest shills for trends that the world has ever seen. vomit.</p>

        <p>a lot of people are dumb if they worship anything, god isn’t real, u can’t prove “he” is. however i agree the msm views are their own form of cult, which is why i take no part in that either. and what about all the ancient religions that have been around way longer than christianity? are those religions bullshit bc ur god is the true god? they think the same thing about u</p>

        <p>Children are experiencing a level of fear that they shouldn’t and unlike adults they will likely internalize it more. As an adult I can just follow the rules to use essential services and I know that I won’t be traumatized by all the propaganda. If this is really just a psy-op then it’s harmless and for the sake of self preservation and not having to pay fines I will follow the rules. But kids aren’t smart enough to think for themselves.</p>
<p>Unless you are wearing a hazmat suit you are not protected. The virus is transmitted by your breath. It’s airborne which means it’s in the air and whatever it lands on or the wind blows it will have the virus. You could literally take off the mask for a second and the wind blows the virus on you. You would need a hazmat suit for complete protection. Oh and buy two so you can wash one while wearing another.</p>
<p>Government would be working overtime trying to keep people calm. You wanna see a recipe for anarchism just bring on a world ending disaster like a meteor or pandemic. When people know they will die and see it happen all around them it brings out the worst in them. </p>
<p>This? I’m following the rules but it’s just not sitting right but that’s my opinion</p>

        <p>It's a bit more like this. The system (i.e. the media-complex that controls all public discourse) incentivizes this behavior. They don't care that it does absolutely nothing (masks, black squares). That's not the point. The point is that it's a test of loyalty. If you post the black square, you are a good person. Likewise for wearing masks. Take Tom Brady for example. As far as we can tell, he's a good guy. But people were absolutely OUTRAGED that he didn't wear a mask. They also hate him because he's straight and white. Therefore he qualifies as a "bad person".  </p>
<p>The purpose is conformity like you say. They wanna gaslight you into thinking your ideas really are behind the times. This is more the case with BLM/LGBT politics, but the same methodology is being used with masks. The remarkable part is that it's much easier to brainwash people in this system than in past totalitarian systems. There's no "state power" telling you what to do and accept. As far as you can tell, these movements are being organized by average people, so you'll have a hard time resisting the herd.</p>

        <p>I think the view of the past that many have, that the state power molded people,s opinions far more than their neighbour, is incorrect. You can't have a totalitarian system without a very large percentage of everyday people agreeing with it.</p>
