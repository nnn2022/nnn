    <strong>All you need to know about immunity: EXPOSURE does wonders!</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://modernfarmer.com/2016/08/amish-asthma-study/">https://modernfarmer.com/2016/08/amish-asthma-study/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; For example, more than 10 years ago <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21060319">a study</a> determined that kids who grew up on farms had fewer instances of asthma, hay fever, and allergies. Last year, <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/11/151102143636.htm">researchers found</a>  that children who grow up with dogs have a 15 percent lower chance of  developing asthma than those without them – <strong>certainly contradictory to  the idea</strong> that dog dander and particles could be a contributing factor.  And now, <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1508749?query=featured_home&amp;">a new study</a> from the Universities of Chicago and Arizona goes even further. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; “Neither the Amish nor the Hutterites have dirty homes,” says the author’s co-author, Carole Ober, PhD, in the <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-08/uocm-guo072916.php">study’s release</a>.  “Both are tidy. The Amish barns, however, are much closer to their  homes. Their children run in and out of them, often barefoot, all day  long. There’s no obvious dirt in the Amish homes, no lapse of  cleanliness. It’s just in the air, and in the dust.” </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>OH GOSH.  The kids play in the barn.....barefoot!  Well that's just plain child abuse according to the histrionic crazies out there on the totalitarian left.  And who knew that going outside and being around animals would actually be GOOD for your IMMUNE SYSTEM.</p>
<p>We have a saying around me (a couple counties away from quite dense Amish country) that "Amish kids don't get hay fever".....and it's because they don't.</p>
<p>Also, the very title of the article/study is interesting to note.  Is says " </p>
<p>&rt;The Bizarre Reason Why Amish Children Are Less At Risk For Asthma</p>
<p>Really?  Doesn't seem all that bizarre to me.  Makes perfect sense actually, and it's in no way "counter-intuitive", although it may be to some people (like the pro-maskers, pro-lockdowners, pro-tyrants) who just do not understand how immune systems develop.</p>
<p>Here is the abstract of the study itself:</p>
<p>&rt;Abstract                <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Numerous epidemiological studies have shown that <strong>children who grow  up on traditional farms are protected from asthma, hay fever and allergic sensitization. Early-life contact with livestock and their  fodder,</strong> <strong><em>and consumption of unprocessed cow's milk</em></strong> <strong>have been identified  as the most effective protective exposures.</strong> Studies of the immunobiology  of farm living point to activation and modulation <em>of innate and  adaptive immune responses</em> by intense microbial exposures and possibly  xenogeneic signals delivered before or soon after birth.     </p>
<p>So you see, it's all about developing innate and adaptive immune responses via EXPOSURE!  And I think both points are key.  Note that the immune system has to be innately healthy, which means that it's working all the time, growing stronger, getting practice, and that it's also adaptive, able to adapt to new and/or changing enemies.  It's sort of like generals who were young officers in prior wars still have to constantly study battlefield tactics in order to be effective in future wars: you have to re-learn the ways your opponents are adapting and changing.  It's not any different in sports or the business world either.  Why would your immune system be any different?</p></p>

        <p>People wonder why I try to spend quality time in natured and forest areas to exercise even though I have Chollinergic Urticaria. I've had an innate sense of these being the true facts of my logic.</p>

        <p>Exposure to covid-19 is a new virus (not an allergen) that causes long-term health issues or death for those who get infected.  Is it worth it to you that people are dead or permanently disabled by being exposed?</p>
<p>Allergic reactions are not relevant when talking about viruses.  They are completely different immune response mechanisms.</p>
