    <strong>How do you handle friends and family succumbing to the media propaganda.</strong>
    <p><p>It might be their views and we can agree to disagree, but we are heading down a dangerous road. I've got into heated debate with some family friends, one of them actually supporting mandatory vaccinations if they come to the US. We kind of went off on a tangent surrounding the topics but we ended up shutting up about it. It's really disappointing after showing these same people examples of the propaganda and then their brain circuits back to the NPC talking points. </p>
<p>I don't know what it takes but I feel like if I even showed them all the sources they would still be in denial. An example of our discussions would be that they think you can sue the vaccine manufacturers and that Dr.Fauci is an upstanding guy defending himself against Rand Paul's lies. Another one that they told me about was the doctor who said that her patients were begging for the vaccine on their deathbed.</p>
<p>The terrifying part is if eventually they go full fascist and want unvaccinated people to lose everything and be forced to get vaccinated or suffer.</p></p>

        <p>I don't talk to them. Sad, but that's what this has come to. I'd rather no contact than anger and fighting. It's easier this way, as hard as it is. I'm not going to change their mind, and there's no way in hell I'm taking that poison.</p>

        <p>So much this^ you just got to stop communicating with these people. It's not good to fight about it... right now anyway. But, people have chosen their sides.</p>

        <p>I do believe there will come a time that we can come back together. Right now, it's too raw. Either they will be proven correct or I will. I'm never afraid to admit when I'm wrong, and I never say I told you so. We just need to do what we can to maintain our sanity until that day comes and not burn any bridges.</p>

        <p>Few people will change stances now. Both sides will dig in deeper. Just watch.</p>
<p>People championing for Forced vaccines etc are NOT changing their minds.</p>

        <p>If the topic comes up, here is what I say:</p>
<p>"We have two options. Either we will debate the issue at lenght and I mean seriously at lenght starting with the philosophy beyond, the psychology, the history and how it developed, how science works, like who choses the curriculum, who funds research, what are the markers to prove/disprove a study, what ways there are to circumvent said markers, how the peer-review-process works, who does the peer-reviews and how the peers are chosen, what are the markers to get a study published and how they influence the studies, the history of the men behind the structures we see today, how media works, how news work, what a news agency is and how that works, what...."</p>
<p>Im usually loosing them at that point. But they will usually stop bugging me about it.</p>
<p>To change their minds... Im not sure that is possible. At least not for us mere humans who dont have "the science" and "the media" behind us.</p>

        <p>We can't change their minds more than they can change ours, because we start from radically different axioms: they think that the government and the media have their best interest at heart, that the pandemic is exceptionally lethal and that it's ok to sacrifice your liberties in the name of safety and protection.</p>
<p>Our basic values are the opposite of that in most cases: those who reject mandatory vaccinations and the whole covid narrative distrust the media and the government, do not think that the virus is as dangerous as they make it out to be and value freedom most of all.</p>
<p>In the end, it's a conflict between libertarian and authoritarian ideologies.</p>

        <p>They want the u.n. to come in and do the dirt. They know as it stands a large group will walk with a dd when faced with a mandate. The u.n. troops will mobilize under dshs to not stir the unaware. Jesus said a mans enemies will be those of his own household. Defend you're freedom when they come for you.</p>

        <p>They have been warned. I have been right about just about everything so far. They admit that and still ignore me half the time. I won’t complain though cause they haven’t gone crazy and are not calling for forced vacs or vac passports so I just leave it be.</p>
