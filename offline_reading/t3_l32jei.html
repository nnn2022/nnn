    <strong>Don't you feel the misunderstood, lonely, and isolated?</strong>
    <p><p>Let's all be real here. </p>
<p>We all came here because we wanted to seek out answers to the questions and doubt that were sown in us in the first place about the pandemic and how the world works in general. </p>
<p>And that led us to some very uncomfortable truths that we had to simmer into us to process. The world isn't what you first thought it was, right? It took a while but your previous perceived notions on how our entire society works is now much more different if not changed completely. </p>
<p>And often going down this road of real reality, this road of uncomfortable truth in a sea of lives, that we feel a bit more lonely and misunderstood because of it. In a world of trying to bring reason, the unreasonable always seems to win over. The sad thing is, is that they think we're the unreasonable and they're the reasonable. In conclusion, it's not easy to convince people and vice versa. </p>
<p>None of us are actually the "crackhead conspiracy nutjobs" they say we are. We're normal individuals who live normal lives who want the same things anyone would want. We just found more uncomfortable truths about the societies we live in and by doing that, we simply can't relate to the average person as much anymore. </p>
<p>I'm speaking out of experience as well. Classmates in my high school can't exactly grasp what I'm trying to say. The think of the world, well, of what the news and classroom says the world is. I, on the other hand, seeked out information for answers while they did other things like spend time with friends. </p>
<p>I'm in no way calling myself a genius or an expert. I don't like self-bloating. I'm just, well, different. Whether or not I'm a genius or idiot will be the story time will tell so that remains to be seen. It just occurred to me that being different can also mean being lonely at times. </p>
<p>I don't like how people get angry when someone asks questions on the perceived notions of the world. </p>
<p>How is that something to be mad about?</p></p>
