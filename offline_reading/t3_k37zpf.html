    <strong>Influenza season during 2017-2018 had overwhelmed the total hospital capacity. COVID has not come anywhere close to that.</strong>
    <p><p>You hear fearmongering of hospitals approaching capacity today but this is actually normal for hospitals to be full in a flu season too.</p>
<p>You can compare covid vs flu seasons. Covid hospitalizations or peak hospitalizations is nowhere exceeding those of past flu seasons.</p>
<p>US covid cumulative hospitalizations: 560k </p>
<p>US flu cumulative hospitalizations in 2017-2018 flu season: 710k</p>
<p>https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_coronavirus_hospitalizations</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season-2017-2018.htm#anchor_1534865852732</p>
<p>Also, TOTAL number of hospitalizations for ANY reason, during the 2017-2018 flu season, had exceeded the number of staffed hospital beds in the United States — 902,202. </p>
<p>People are worried covid can crowd out other sick people yet this is NORMAL TO HAPPEN in past flu seasons. WHY IS THERE LOCKDOWNS AND MASK MANDATES today but not in the past?</p>

        <p>But that wasn't the plan.  Hospitals were bankrupted instead by this pandemic because governors everywhere banned "elective procedures" to make room for covid patients that never came.  Staff were laid off because hospitals had no income.  The reason for this was because they needed hospitals to play along.  They needed false positives and covid patients and patients on vents.  So governments and medicaid paid money for each one of those:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hospitals lost money if they didn't have covid patients because they had to turn away elective procedures.</p>

        <p>They banned elective procedures because the bulk of people getting those elective procedures are sorry to say not in the best of health.</p>
<p>My father really should not have gotten his coronary artery bypass done in late February and if he hadn't have gotten it done, I think he and Mom would be alive right now because he wouldn't have been in the rehab center where he caught CoVid-19, giving it to Mom when they shipped him home because he was scared of getting CoVid-19 with his pre-ex's.</p>

        <p>Not true. I work in a hospital and my roommate needed an elective procedure. She wasn't vulnerable but all her treatment for her condition stopped. Covid is not more dangerous than influenza or H1N1 or SARS or any of the other viruses we've seen in recent years. It's been recorded that a lot of people died as a result of not getting treatment. Fortunately my roommate wasn't one of them and treatment finally resumed. </p>
<p>It's not right to cause a lot of deaths just because a few might die. You don't kill people just to stop one person from dying.</p>

        <p>The difference is that most seasonal flus do not need people to be put on ventilators.</p>
<p>That is why hospitals are so freaked out about this CoVid-19: It needs measures that no seasonal flu that was widespread in the past needed too often.</p>

        <p>Wrong wrong wrong</p>
<p>Need for invasive mechanical ventilation was similar (59% in COVID-19 vs. 55% in influenza). </p>
<p>https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1513/AnnalsATS.202007-805OC</p>
<p>Keep in mind that </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Covid has 10 times more undiagnosed cases vs diagnosed so the rate of ventilator use per covid case is EVEN lower than flu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This study was on covid patients in the spring. Back then everyone was ventilated asap. As of TODAY doctors are no longer putting covid patients onto ventilators as much because they realize early use now kills them faster</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So when newer studies come out it WILL confirm further that covid ventilator use is actually LESS than flu.</p>

        <p>CDC estimates that the burden of illness during the 2017–2018 season was also high with an estimated 48.8 million people getting sick with influenza, 22.7 million people going to a health care provider, 959,000 hospitalizations, and 79,400 deaths from influenza (Table 1).</p>
<p>US covid deaths, WITH LOCKDOWNS and attempts at social distancing and mask wearing, 266,000 to date. </p>
<p>And yes, hospitals were overwhelmed and many are overwhelmed now. I have family who work in the hospital, its absolutely brutal. </p>

        <p>&rt;    US covid cumulative hospitalizations: 560k
&rt;
&rt;    US flu cumulative hospitalizations in 2017-2018 flu season: 710k</p>
<p>That’s quite striking considering Covid has only been in the US for 10 months, but hasn’t been widespread throughout the country since around May. This is with restrictions in place. If we had no restrictions and Covid had a full 12 months to count, you can believe hospitalizations would be much higher.  </p>
<p>A fully open economy and a full year of time would mean Covid blows the 2017-2018 flu epidemic out of the water.</p>

        <p>You’re not getting it. Don’t be a simpleton closed minded fool, unable to think outside the box.</p>
<p>Why is it that IL, MN, etc the blue states with heavy restrictions all have surging cases higher than the states that remained much more open (TX, Fl, GA etc)?</p>
<p>Lockdowns did jack SHIT to stop eventual spread anywhere. All it did was force unemployment and restrict people’s rights.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that despite covid deaths the projected excess deaths for the year will only be 10% higher than usual. And that MANY of these excess covid deaths are due to OLD PEOPLE already destined to die soon of other causes, and that many deaths ARE DUE TO LOCKDOWNS themselves. Many people with symptoms of stroke or heart attack, drug overdoses etc do not come to the ER anymore for fear of covid. Many people don’t see their doc for symtoms of disease that turn out to be deadly.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>Analysis by the Oxford experts at the CEBM was compiled from data provided by the Office for Nation Statistics (ONS).</p>
<p>It shows that the average age of people dying in England and Wales from Covid-19 is 82.4.</p>
<p>This is slightly higher than deaths caused by other illnesses, which has a median age of 81.5.</p>

        <p>Please don't cite tabloids, they aren't a reliable source.<br>
COVID is now the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-is-now-the-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-the-u-s1/">third leading cause of death in the US</a> behind only cancer and heart disease. It is also the <a href="https://time.com/5815367/coronavirus-deaths-comparison">4th deadliest event in US history</a> behind only World War II, the Civil War, and the Spanish Flu Pandemic.   </p>
<p>Are you claiming that keeping people apart will not slow down an infectious disease? Or are you saying the benefit isn't worth the negative impacts?<br>
You are right though. We knew we wouldn't be able to stop the eventual spread everywhere. All we can do is try to keep it as minimal as possible without completely locking everyone inside. A balance act of keeping the virus in check while disrupting lives as little as possible. I find it humorous that you are trying to act like democrat areas are hardest hit when it is clearly rural America that is suffering right now, not exactly the DNC stronghold.   </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex">CDC Data</a><br>
Do some simple math here. About 20% of all US deaths are people under 65. Like most health issues, it is more grim for the elderly, but it's not a free pass for middle aged Americans.</p>

        <p>Obviously it would be worse if young people were dying, but old people are still people. Why is it okay for them to die of COVID? 48,000 people under age 65 have died of COVID so far. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm">That's more deaths than all flu deaths for all age groups from last year.</a> Why is this acceptable for you? Your argument seems to be 'they're old so it doesn't matter', is that a fair assumption?  </p>

<p>I think this is a point of disagreement. People are responsible for themselves and people around them.   </p>
<p>You’re playing extremes and putting words in my mouth. I never advocated for full lockdowns. This is a common tactic of a losing position especially used by people that cannot think critically. Last I checked a mask mandate didn’t destroy an economy. But the fools on this sub have made it clear that even wearing a mask is too much to ask of them.  </p>
<p>You still haven’t dealt with the high death toll of people under 65, let alone the staggering death toll of people over 65. Those death tolls are with restrictions and mask mandates. How much higher would it be in a completely open economy and no masks? That seems to be the aim of this sub.</p>
