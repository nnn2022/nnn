    <strong>The theory of covid pocalypse</strong>
    <p><p>Pro lockdown thinking is based on the idea that every social cost of lockdown is worth it because, if we lived in an alternative world of no restrictions or restrictions that were limited and did not hamper normal life, there would be some apocalyptic disaster. Restrictions prevented some super slaughter, so, they are worth it.</p>
<p>Of course this theory does not make sense and, if you are here, you know that. If lockdowns were that effective, Texas, South Dakotan and Sweden should have been really worse off than everywhere else.</p>
<p>Go and see any pro lockdown thinker: it is always based on some journalist or youtuber who says that normal life would be some sort of super genocide. The most famous one is Neil Ferguson, but there are plenty of them.</p>
<p>In Brazil, we have Atila Iamarino, who got famous for his apocalyptical youtubes where he predicted that, by 1st October 2020, we would have 1 million dead in Brazil. If we did not do anything, 3 million.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Atila Iamarino published another video with the title: how normal life would be a slaughter.</p>
<p>How is the covidpocalipyse theory in your country?</p></p>
