    <strong>Undercover Agents.</strong>
    <p><p>The usefulness of lockdowns is controversial, and I would say softly. No one with common sense can deny that the measures are worse than the disease. Anyone who lists all the pros and cons and still is able to support the measures is still in fear, unjustified fear. After all, one must be able to stretch all logic to Olympic proportions in order to still be behind curfew. I therefore fully endorse the intentions of the protesters and believe that they have the right to draw attention to this and to reclaim their freedom.</p>
<p>Everyone knows by now that the demonstrations from the police are incited by undercover agents, Romeo's in the vernacular. The films are now widely circulating on social media and a beautiful collage can be found. Because of these Romeoâ€™s, the situation escalates even more and innocent people become victims. Some people right now, is now sitting at home incapacitated for work with bruises from rubber sticks.</p>
<p>My request is to address the Romeo's among the police about their behavior. If you dare to be undercover with a drug gang, that's pretty cool. However, when Romeo rioting between a group of calm protesters is cowardly, in fact a form of treason. Do you think this will win the love of the people? Do you think that you will be treated with respect at the next demonstration? The likelihood of anger and escalation only increases.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that that is exactly what the government wants, escalation, so that even more measures and even tougher action are justified.</p>
<p>As a police you want to be hated by the criminals but loved by the people? Do you also want to be pelted by snowballs when you walk down the street? , Would you like to be looked at with the neck at birthdays or your children's sports club? My request is therefore to consider such actions or to enter into discussions with colleagues.</p>
<p>If there are police chiefs who want to hear a critical sound ; feel free to get in touch. I will be delighted to walk into a police station and, while enjoying a cup of coffee, will reveal to you a critical view of lockdowns and curfews. Then you may also understand the protesters a little more and it becomes clear that this people is not your enemy.</p></p>
