<title>If 2+2 = 4, but you got a Harvard degree because you studied for 5 years that 2+2=5. Then what's 2+2? Oh wait sorry I mean no new normal is just a bunch of clowns who are insane.</title>

        <p>We are fanatics, but they are the ones who injected themselves with unknown substances, wear a cloth over their faces day after day, avoid other people, ready ti inject their kids with unknown substances, want to be lockdown, yell at people who don't act like them. And all of that because one man told them to. Oh yes, we can definitely understand who the fanatics are.</p>

        <p>Now they want you to be fired from your job and banned from voting if you don't take an experimental shot from the same companies they've been complaining about for the last decade.</p>
<p>But right, I'm a fanatic.</p>

        <p>I’d love to know what their medical degree taught them about mRNA injections or what actually is in the shots they’re handing out. I’d love to know how they <em>know</em> anything they are told or believe about this is true and how their medical degree has any bearing. </p>
<p>Because you know what? In medical school it’s mostly “be fed a huge amount of information, automatically believe whatever you’re told, regurgitate.” Hence the widely-varying opinions in new shit like this from other MDs.</p>
<p>They largely aren’t researchers, they’re body technicians. They’re largely not performing any science themselves. They aren’t deriving chemical formulas from first principles and running tests with large data sets to confirm the designs. No. They’re parroting information fed to them and showing their MD as if it has any meaning regarding something they aren’t actually knowledgeable about. </p>
<p>I’m an electrical engineer (RF). In engineering school we are taught how to derive expressions from very basic provable principles. I know how to prove what the electromagnetic coupling ratio between two microstrip conductors near each other is all  the way back from F=ma. It takes a long time and I don’t ever need to do it but I can show that truth and that’s how I <em>know.</em> In grad school I did some such research myself. </p>
<p>yet I can’t say “trust me, I’m an engineer” to a layman regarding how different semiconductor technologies affect the types of control algorithms one can use when designing a feedback control system, just because some controls engineer (with the same EE degree as me) told me the end result. I’m not educated on that. I don’t <em>know</em> it and my degree (which is the same as his) is meaningless in that regard.</p>
<p>Argument from authority is a fallacy.</p>
