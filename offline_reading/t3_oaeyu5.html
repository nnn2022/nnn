    <strong>Had my first job interview in over a year...</strong>
    <p><p>Hey folks! I've been participating in this sub for a while under my older username u/joeyedward which was banned for a response to a brigadier in this sub, who I felt was mentally ill. Anyway...    </p>
<p>Today I had my first job interview since before the pandemic began. I walked in without a mask and was pleasantly surprised to see no one else inside wearing one. I had debated giving in and putting it on because frankly, my family is in a tough spot. I have two kids and a house and it's been really hard because of the effects the pandemic had on my previous job. They relocated to the other side of the country (Oregon to Oklahoma) shortly after the pandemic started to get restrictive to their cash flow. I really needed work and I'll put myself through anything I have to at this point to make our lives better.    </p>
<p>In the I end however, I decided not to wear the rag and like I said, not a mask in sight once I entered the building. I was nervous they would ask about my "vaccination status" or have aggressive policy in regard to the VID but there wasn't a single mention of it. Nothing. The interview went really well and I was offered and accepted the position on sight!     </p>
<p>I had a totally normal day today. Straight up real life regular American guy shit and it felt amazing. I was assuming I'm in the minority in my feelings about this or that people are seeking to make life harder for people like me. Maybe some people are but today gave me a beautiful ray of hope. It was the first time in a long time that this pandemic bullshit truly had no impact on my life in the slightest. Thanks for reading.</p></p>

        <p>Good fuckin job bro!!! Also, I feel safe estimating that most people who would brigade here might have a touch of mental illness.</p>

        <p>Nice, this makes me happy to hear. I've been enjoying that feeling every day since they lifted the mask mandate in my state. Except at work, where they still make us wear "face coverings" (it's a college), and just recently mandated that we all get vaccinated, which I did last weekend. The thing is, I had COVID-19 back in October, so I felt no need to take experimental drugs whose sole purpose is to provide immunity that I've already acquired through natural means. I live alone, and had only been around my parents, my best friend, and my sister's immediate family. All of them got tested, all negative. So I didn't get it from them. Everywhere else I went, I wore an N95 mask, not a "face covering", so naturally I don't think wearing face coverings is doing anything beyond making easily scared people feel safer (which is counterintuitive because then they take more risks since they're "protected").</p>
<p>But hey, at least my time not at work is back to normal. So I'm glad you found a job at a place where people aren't fear-mongering.</p>
