    <strong>Just destroyed my family by trying to get doomer girlfriend to go meet our new neighbors</strong>
    <p><p>I never post but here goes. Last week our new neighbors kindly invited us over to chat and get to know each other. We have rambunctious dogs who can be loud, my girlfriend had apologized to them and was embarrassed by the commotion... I told her, don't worry, they don't hate you, they are friendly! See they invited us over..</p>
<p>"Absolutely not"</p>
<p>"You can go but then you have to find a new place to live for 2 weeks"</p>
<p>"It's not safe"</p>
<p>I'm like "listen... how long are we going to live in fear? It's been almost a year of this shit"</p>
<p>She's not having it. So she starts writing a note.
 "Please don't invite people over during a pandemic" and she's off the go deliver the note. I tried to stop her by grabbing the note. She stuffed it into her pocket and is headed to the door. So I grabbed her arm/jacket to try to get her to stop for a moment..</p>
<p>She gets very anxious about what people think of her.. I'm thinking she will feel embarrassed later for leaving a rude note for no reason... anyways, I grab her arm and she immediately overreacts and starts BITING MY FINGERS. I just reacted with reflex and I yanked my hand away and administered the bear hug maneuver. SO SHE GRABS A FUCKING MACHETE OFF THE TABLE NEXT TO US. So I panic and I'm like wtf and now we are fighting over the machete. So I tighten up the bear hug and dropped my weight and we both went to the ground (not hard) and she's going absolutely fuckong ballistic, I mean screaming and cursing like never before, hyperventilating, kicking, she grabbed my glasses and threw them and started going for my eyes. I'm too fuckinf terrified to release her because she's trying to get me with a fucking machete, and she's NOT CALMING DOWN.</p>
<p>She finally relaxes a little and she says let me go I won't hurt you so I let her go. She comes back 5 minutes later and we talk some more, she keeps accusing me of being violent and I'm trying to tell her that if she tries to bite my fingers off or stab me then I have no choice but defend myself.</p>
<p>Obviously if I could go back and not grab her arm, I wouldn't grab her arm. But it's too late for that. </p>
<p>Then she literally grabbed by the throat, but not like all around the throat. Like her nails were digging into each side of my esophagus. I fucking slapped her so hard, which I have NEVER EVER done before EVER despite her hitting me multiple times in the past. As soon as the slap connected she let go of my throat and looked very surprised. </p>
<p>I am too self aware of how much of a fucking retarded loser I am by even being in this situation to tell anyone in real life what is happening. Except 1 person who is actually my girlfriends friend, but she's the only person I can ask to be a 3rd party.</p>
<p>It usually goes really poorly for me, they gang up on me. Like the conversation starts with "how the fuck do you think it's OK to grab a fucking machete go use against me?" And 5 seconds later they're both sitting there like "well, yknow you just need like a better attitude, yknow it's your job to make sure she's happy, so... basically don't step out of line again and u won't problems"</p>
<p>Thanks neutral 3rd party, I'm glad that I could be lectured by you and my girlfriend about how I use too many dishes when I cook dinner and I am not a good listener right after I have to defend my life from a machete. </p>
<p>I'm too much of a pussy to call the cops because I know that she DESERVES to be arrested, but she will absolutely say ANYTHING to take me down with her. I'll more than likely be the one in jail, since I'm a man. Even if not for that, I'm just in denial that it happened and if she actually gets arrested then shit gets real, real fast. We also have a 8 month old daughter.</p>
<p>We are really struggling and I have told her that I want to hire a house cleaner and babysitter to help us with everything going on.</p>
<p>Absolutely not, too dangerous. </p>
<p>I work full time, I'm a college student and I own my own business. Despite that, I may never be as rich as her family.</p>
<p>So we are arguing for quite some time, I'm trying to say "look at your fucking behavior right now. This alone is evidence that these lockdowns are hurting us. We need help. We are not ok"</p>
<p>And we go back and forth for a while, like over an hour with our 3rd party. I stayed strong for a long time, and then I broke down at the end when my girlfriend started making fun of me and laughing at me for "being raped my my uncle as a child" and telling me to "pull my uncles dick out of my ass"</p>
<p>That's not really how the story went, no surprise she flubbed the details, but just the fact of someone someone is supposed to love me bringing up my childhood sexual abuse to hurt my feelings.</p>
<p>Well it worked and I just started crying and then magically both of them just left within moments. Hours of argument ended immediately the moment I broke down and wept. I guess that's the closure they wanted.</p>
<p>The worst part is I can't even kill myself, despite her suggesting it numerous times, because I know it would break my mother's heart. If not for her I'd just end it all, I have nothing besides this sham of a family with a girlfriend who abuses me and a daughter that will probably grow up to hate me.</p>
<p>Idk what to guys I don't have anyone to speak to about this.</p>
<p>Tldr please show me some kindness I really need it</p></p>

        <p>Saw my dad almost driven to the brink by custody courts.   Child support and stress probably took 20 years off his life. Not to mention the whole ordeal traumatized me and my sisters.  What do you think would be a good agreement?</p>

        <p>If she has been violent are abusive towards your child, you have a duty to try to get full custody.  If not, I’d say joint.  But, if you stay and engage in physical altercations, you could end up in jail, even if she is at fault or started it.   If she isn’t abusing your child, I’d  recommend leaving but trying to remain civil.  And only a lawyer can tell you your options.</p>

        <p>She's never hurt our daughter intentionally. But emotionally or developmentally idk what the yelling and screaming does to a 9month old. And when she's in a state of rage, she's not thinking clearly about safety. It can't be good. When she leaves angrily with our daughter I just pray she doesn't get into an accident from road rage or something. Thanks for replying to me.</p>

        <p>Whoa. So, obviously I don’t know your girlfriends side of this story, but from what I am reading here, I mean, Holy shit... Get out of that relationship before she pulls some extra crazy stuff and gets YOU arrested and labeled an abuser for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Stay strong. Don’t let people make you feel like this!! Be the best Dad you can to your daughter but that doesn’t have to involve staying with her mother. I’m sorry for all the pain this is causing you!</p>

        <p>She called the police on me 3 weeks ago over nothing.  I think it's a miracle I wasn't arrested. This shit is going downhill fast. We have been together for 4 years. Daughter is almost 9months. I feel sick. I'm just finally becoming economically stable. Everything is so fragile right now. Her dad is also the owner of the company I work for... no doubt she will try to get me fired if I leave. And in that event I sure as fuck can't afford to stay here in NY. Thank you for the kind words. I hope you're doing better than me right now. Happy new year, friend.</p>

        <p>Man that sucks!! I’m so sorry! Try to map out a plan, make smart moves like saving little bits here and there, maybe keep an eye out for some other job opportunities and definitely try to avoid issues with her for now.</p>
<p>I was in a long term, horribly abusive relationship in the past so I know how delicate and scary it can be! Most importantly keep your head up and protect yourself.</p>
<p>Happy New Year to you as well!! Here’s hoping this year has something better in store for you!! 🍻</p>

        <p>Feels like I deserve it at this point for letting it get here. We weren't perfect people before this pandemic but this state of fear is hell and it's left us worse off. </p>
<p>The other day, I tried to show my gf a video from this sub... fauci saying people shouldn't wear masks. She literally threw my Bluetooth headphone at the wall at 15 seconds in. It's so bizarre.. who does that? We aren't mentally healthy if we violently repel or are too scared to hear information that you might disagree with. Stockholm syndrome?</p>
<p>Edit: Grew up without a certain kind of love and zero self worth and now I'm a loser willing to put up with anything to feel cared about sometimes and maybe not think about dying alone for 5 minutes. Which pill do I take to make this all go away?</p>

        <p>It will be okay bud, get away from her. Especially now we need people in our lives that are positive and healthy. Don't ever give up, we love you, we need you. Take this as motivation. Buckle down, do better in school, be a better dad (not that you aren't but something that important you always can strive for better), eat better, exercise more, be more charitable, make your reality the one you want. The more positive you can be the more positive things will come.</p>

        <p>I was in a bad relationship for 2 years longer than it should have been. When I finally got away, I realized I needed to make a change and never let that happen again. I focused on work, family and my health. Lost 65lbs. I threw myself into work and by doing that my business blossomed. I spend every Sunday with my niece now, it's one of the things that makes me the most happy. By being positive so many good things started happening. I was able to get rid of all my debit and have a very healthy savings. This was a 180 degree difference in just about 5 years. Never give up, if you keep your head up, focus, you can achieve anything you desire. You got this! If you ever need to talk, reach out</p>

        <p>Hey man I don’t know your life but this sounds terrible, she doesn’t sound like a good person. I get it, sometimes a chick might freak out like that and if this story is true you did the right thing. But honestly if she said that about what happened when you were younger that is crossing the line. You sound like a normal person and deserve a better woman. You need some one that makes you feel good about yourself not makes you feel like shit. I broke up with an ex of 5 years once which was really hard but eventually my life was so much better. </p>
<p>Either way, don’t kill yourself. We’ve all been there but life will get better one day I promise you just gotta get through the hard times one day at a time when they come. Stay strong bro and think about what you want in life.</p>
