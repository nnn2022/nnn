    <strong>For Canadians: Are the "measures" lawful? Let's see.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://nonewabnormal.com/are-the-measures-lawful/">Here is my post</a> on the law angle. Yes, am aware of the concerns with the Application section (doesn't mention anything about any of it applying to "we the people"). I think it's still important - what else do we have?</p>
<p>Provided are links to the official documentation from the government and their page where you can order a free copy or download the PDF versions. My takeaway is obviously that what's happened is completely unlawful and I don't buy their excuses that it's an emergency, I don't think they are operating within the law even with that.</p>
<p>Take a look and let me know what you think, and if I've missed anything important that should be added.</p></p>

        <p>It would be interesting to see a list of covid fines and charges that were thrown out or not. I have only read about courts throwing out the charges and if they are all tossed out of court then I would think they could be used in a much larger class action suit against the government for infringing on our rights.</p>

        <p>That's a good idea. I'll add that in if I can find anything substantive.</p>
