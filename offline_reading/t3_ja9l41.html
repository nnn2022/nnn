<p>This was my Conspiracy Theory.<br>
Q. How often was Trump being tested for the CCP virus?<br>
A. Daily. He was being extremely careful.<br>
Q. How easy would it be to ensure that the swab used for testing Trump had the virus on it BEFORE testing so that THE SWAB would give him the virus?<br>
A. Very easy for anyone who could gain access to the testing swabs.<br>
Q. What’s the likelihood that after 7 months Trump catches the virus *naturally or accidentally* less than 5 weeks before Election Day?<br>
A. Close to zero.<br>
Q. Does Trump have enemies who might bribe someone to contaminate or ensure that Trump’s test swab was contaminated with the virus prior to testing?<br>
A. Duh</p>

        <p>This is idiotic, it would be far easier to just fake a positive result. In fact, given he had no symptoms, it could of just been a false positive anyway, especially if you are getting tested every single day, the chances of a false positive are incredibly high.  </p>
<p>If you are going to go through the trouble of infecting someone with a virus, it better be one that is actually harmful, not one that at worst will give you a mild sniffle.  I don't see any advantage to deliberately infecting him so that he is then able to show how harmless the virus is.</p>

<p>Trump is a loose cannon, unpredictable. </p>
<p>Perhaps they hoped to moderate some aspect of his personality (<strong>his apperance at and insistence on holding large rallies is a stark difference from his opponents lackluster appeal</strong>)</p>
