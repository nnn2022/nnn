    <strong>A small complaint: New normal shopping experience</strong>
    <p><p>Just some thoughts after going to my local mall this afternoon..</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>First, only one entrance is open, so depending on where you are coming from, you have to walk around half the exterior of the mall just to get inside. Not sure how this isn't a fire hazard, but okay.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>About a dozen of the stores have already closed for good after being prohibited from opening for nearly six months. This is the more "upscale" mall in the area, so it could be pretty bad for the local economy if becomes an abandoned mall. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Then, I went in three stores. Each one had an employee at the door to check my temperature and give me a squirt of hand sanitizer. By the last store, my hands were dried out from all the hand sanitizer. I asked the lady manning the door if I could skip the sanitizer since I just got some 2 minutes ago. I must've been the first person to pushback, since she sounded caught off guard. "Well, no... because you're not allowed... uhh.." I just thought it was odd that would require this, on top of masks and social distancing.</p></p>

        <p>So many stores and restaurants are not going to survive these restrictions. Ultimately, the blame can be on the governor's, but a lot of people have stopped even pretending to provide good customer service.</p>

        <p>This is the thing- why bother even shopping at these places? I do not, and I don’t find it difficult at all. I order groceries curbside pickup, and buy most other stuff on amazon or online. A lot of stuff I just skip- covid has been kind to my budget at least. I actually enter a store maybe twice a month (if that) and that is only if for something that just can’t wait. I feel bad for these businesses, but seriously, no thanks! I’m not going to pay good $ to be treated that way. I am not hiding at home either- we socialize a ton, have people over, the kids have friends over, we are outside a lot, spend a lot of time at our kids’ sporting events etc. We are not home that much actually. But anywhere that requires masks/security theater? Nope- not happening if I can help it. Vote with your feet.</p>

        <p>Carry a small bottle with you and tell them you're allergic to most brands of hand sanitizers and that you used your own. I won't put an unknown substance on my hands. At the very least, there's a good chance it has a fragrance. I can't stand to have my hands smell like anything.</p>

        <p>I really do enjoy preparing some popcorn and laughing at how needy and selfish all of you people are.</p>
<p>Its fascinating; you call everyone else "sheep" and try to concoct more and more...diverse opinions (that's all you people have), but are just making it harder on yourselves by not just doing it.</p>
<p>What is the big deal about putting on sanitizer and a mask?</p>
<p>your hands are dry? awww muffin</p>
<p>You can't breathe properly?
Yes you can. Of course you can. You're just upset about a tiny inconvenience. </p>
<p>It's not a big deal. Never was. How petty do you have to be to go through all these ridiculous mental gymnastics just to try to get out of wearing a mask for a little bit.</p>
<p>What's actually sickening and embarrassing is your delusional "stand" against something so miniscule. Grow up all of you</p>
