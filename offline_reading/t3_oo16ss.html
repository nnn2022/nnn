        <p>Which is impossible to know because we have only had vaccines available for like 8-9 months. </p>
<p>There have been documented cases of dangerous short-term side effects already though, which doesn’t bode well. </p>
<p>Anyone else curious should check out the vaccine adverse effect reporting system, VAERS. You can filter by side effects experienced for the COVID vaccine only, and the results are pretty shocking to read through.</p>

        <p>Not completely impossible. I'd say death would definitely be appropriate for the "long term side effect" catagory. You don't get more long term than that. And the amount of people who have died already is not insignificant.</p>

        <p>You’re using a different definition of long-term and short-term than I am I guess. What I mean to say is that we don’t know what effects may manifest themselves years from now due to these vaccines. Dying from the vaccine after a few months I would still consider a short-term effect because with happened so soon after vaccination.</p>

        <p>Years?! What do you think the vaccine does in your body? You literally piss out the components of the vaccine within a few days of getting it. Vaccines dont stay in you for your whole life thats not how any of this works. How in the world will something 10 years down the line have anything to do with the covid vaccine? Or do you actually think it alters DNA (literally impossible since its an mRNA vaccine). </p>
<p>If it helps you at all the fact that losing your sense of smell is a major symptom of covid19 infection (which also persists longer after the infection clears) tells us that covid19 can infect our nervous system and might be breaking through the blood brain barrier. This legit could feasibly cause health issues down the line that could be terrible like early onset Alzheimer’s or some other degenerative disease.</p>

        <p>You’d have done well as a lawyer defending the tobacco industry. “What do you think cigarette smoke is doing in your lungs? You literally exhale it within a few seconds.”</p>
<p>Also the example you gave of covid potentially breaking through the blood brain barrier is also speculated as to what’s happening with vaccine injured people experiencing the same long covid symptoms. Spike protein not doing as originally intended and leaving cells at the injection site, breaking away and flowing through blood to places it shouldn’t be.</p>

        <p>2 things, cigarettes smoke going into your lungs is not a comparison. Your lungs are essentially absorbing the nicotine + whatever other chemicals the tobacco is treated with, which is why you can visibly see blackened lungs in the people who have smoked their entire lives. The vaccine components are not maintained in the injection site, and you dont get 2-3 injections every day in the same spot for 50 years. </p>
<p>The other thing, yes, the spike protein is being produced by the cells that take up the mRNA and is leaving those cells. Thats a good thing, thats why the vaccine works. If the mRNA just gets into the cell, and no spike protein leaves that cell, then your immune cells will never recognize it as an antigen and will never bring samples of it to your lymph nodes to give you immune memory. Your concern in this particular instance is literally the vaccine doing what its supposed to do</p>

        <p>Even if there are long term side effects (likely) it is dubious if they will ever be properly attributed the vaccine. People are already trying to keep the vaccine from any culpability in the case of injury or death, and this is in people who are harmed within close proximity to when they got the jab- imagine how bad it will be years down the road!</p>

        <p>So then there are zero reliable sources for reporting side effects of vaccines. Does that not make you MORE of a vaccine skeptic if there’s no reliable way to report negative side effects?

        <p>&rt; How would the public ever know if a vaccine caused widespread illness or death if we can’t trust any reported data?</p>
<p>Would be anecdotal.</p>
<p>I know a 3 people who've died of covid and several more who were hospitalized (I work with lots of people 50+)</p>
<p>I know tons of people who are vaccinated, and nobody any worse side effects than flu like symptoms for a few hours after the second shot</p>
<p>There would also be a spike in excess deaths. If young, otherwise healthy people start dropping dead at the rate this sub seems to think will happen, there will be no way to cover it up</p>

        <p>I took dozens of vaccines in the military, I have no problem with approved, safe vaccines. Save the antivaxxer rhetoric for someone else. I do have a problem with ‘vaccines’ that only have emergency authorization and are sounding the alarm bells on our early warning system. What person in their right mind would look at the VAERS data and conclude this ‘vaccine’ is safe?</p>

        <p>My experience has been that every woman I know who was vaccinated (who I am close to) explained their next period as the most unbearable pain they could have imagined. And then they went on to have intermittent periods in between their cycles as well. I also know a woman who started her period even though she had already gone through menopause. </p>
<p>Do you think the women in your office are openly talking about their periods or other health concerns with their coworkers? Probably not.</p>

        <p>The question remains. How do we know that vaccines are safe?</p>
<p>If we go by your anecdotal method, I must be vaccine hesitant.</p>
<p>In my circle of circles there are 4 credible reports of very bad vaccine injury and 0 reports of death or long covid.</p>

        <p>There is a vaccine 'fund' that is used to pay out to people hurt by vaccines.  It's more akin to workman's comp than traditional product liability, but it is incorrect to say that 'you are on your own' if you are harmed by the vaccine.  There are still plenty of reasons to be skeptical.</p>

        <p>I like that attitude. If the news wasnt talking about the virus non stop, and if now they werent makingg massive efforts to push it ob people, if several civil liberties werent theatened wblfre the vaccine was even ANNOUNCED, celebrites and the fucking muppets werent in vaccine PSAs, Id be less suspicious. Id still be suspicious, but less so. </p>
<p>The whole everyone needs to take the vaccine narrative is what really scares me. Based on stats from AMJA Iw as able to determine the likeliness you will die from corona if you get vaccinated, regsrdless of what anyone else does.</p>
<p>1 in 7200, around the same that you’ll die in a car accident. But we dont demand everyone not drive.</p>

        <p>Even if it gets FDA approval, the companies still will not be held liable for any adverse effects.  Plus, the vast majority of us really don't need it.  Unless you're a vitamin D deficient diabetic with a heart condition, you will most likely be fine.  And some of us are just old-fashioned... we trust our immune systems (which were developed over thousands and thousands of years) over a vaccine that was developed in record time.</p>

        <p>Were all the Texas Democrats on that plane vaccinated.  They were not wearing masks, so I am assuming they were.  Either that or the biggest hypocrites ever.  The point is 6 of the 10 now have covid and they spread it to more people in DC.  Fauci said if you have the vaccine you don’t have to wear a mask.  So there you have it.  The vaccine is not the magic pill they make it out to be.</p>

        <p>We get back to normal when enough people realize this "pandemic" is a scam and demand their freedoms back.  Never before have we been forced to take experimental vaccines for a virus with a 99.8% survival rate.  "Long COVID" seems to only exist in the media or "I know a guy" stories.</p>
<p>You seem to have fallen for the "just take the vaccine and we can get back to normal" lie.  Yeah, sure, it may be experimental and potentially harmful to me but I just have to take it once and the government will let me be normal again.  Oh wait, I need a booster.  Oh wait, now I need a second booster.  Oh no, another variant better rush to get the experimental shot for that.  Ah, time for my third booster for original COVID.</p>
<p>You are signing yourself up to become a cocktail of experimental drugs for a glorified flu.</p>

        <p>Covid won’t end because there are countries outside of the US that have virtually zero vaccination rates. The US isn’t the only country in the world. The Delta Variant came from India. Covid will continue to mutate and will likely become the new Flu. Sorry to burst your bubble. Also 2 weeks to slow the spread was about making sure the health care system wouldn’t colapse, we’re long past that, hospitalization rates are way down. The pandemic is over.</p>

        <p>Because they havent had the chance to get the vaccine yet. The only reason this pandemic wont ever end is due to those who wont take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Hospitalizations may be down but once we get to the flu season theyll shoot back up among the unvaccinated</p>

        <p>So you’re saying that unvaccinated people in the US are a greater threat to extending a world wide virus than countries with virtually 0% vaccination rates? Whether it’s due to them having access to vaccines or not, you’ve lost all credibility with that take. Biden and the EU don’t even want to lift patent protections for the vaccine so that they can be mass produced for impoverished countries. If they really gave a damn about getting people vaccinated, that’s what they’d do. Even Fauci said it would take years to get the entire world vaccinated to a point of herd immunity. You and them only care about people in western civilized countries.</p>

        <p>Covid is not gonna end until we can get enough people vaccinated for herd immunity, and if thats because the US is gonna be greedy with vaccines then thats gonna be the reason for this pandemic lasting so long. When did I say I only care about people in western countries? Itd be nice if more people in the US got the shot but in the meantime the patent protections should be lifted.</p>

        <p>Because mRNA vaccines have never been used on a large scale, were rushed through human trials, have side effects that are being covered up or unreported by media, because the virus is not as deadly as it has been made out to be if you’re a healthy individual (which I am), because my number one priority is keeping myself and my family healthy and safe, because I don’t trust big government, because the US armed forces aren’t even requiring their own troops to be vaccinated for Covid, because my kids want to have kids of their own one day and I do not trust this vaccine, and about 100 other reasons. My parents got vaccinated. They are older and the risk / reward made more sense for them at the time- now they’re starting to question whether or  or they should have gone through with it</p>

        <p>I find it odd that the apparent excuse not to get the vaccine is 'health' risks. But when it comes to wearing a mask with literally 0% health risks you won't even do that. Bizzaro world.</p>

        <p>How do you know if I wear a mask or not?</p>
<p>The point is, we’ve been just fine for thousands of years without wearing a gross mask over our faces. Suggesting we do this indefinitely going forward is ludicrous.</p>
<p>And actually, there are health risks associated with wearing a mask - bacterial pneumonia, for one. When we had a massive heat wave here a few weeks back and people still insisted on covering their faces? Yeah, also a health risk.</p>

<p>I’m glad it’s your little bubba security blanket to ward off the scary things, but us adults living in the real world know they don’t do a goddamn thing. So you’re damn right I’m not wearing one if it’s not mandated.</p>

        <p>Because you're wrong, it does do something. It helps you from spreading the virus when you inevitably get it. I dont care if you get covid if you're not wearing one, I care if you spread it to someone who has a compromised immune system.</p>
<p>Actually us 'real' adults man up and do whats needed to be done to protect others and our families. You are a child who throws a big temper tantrum because you have to wear a tiny piece of cloth over your face because fox News told you not to.</p>

        <p>Sure buddy, that’s it. I’ve had covid. It was a cold. This “pandemic” is not what it has been made out to be. If you’re a healthy individual it’s highly unlikely that it will affect you as anything more than a cold. My mental health and the mental health of my family is important, and masking up for a virus that is not dangerous to me or my family is not good for our mental health. And I live in Texas, so I have the freedom to not vaccinate, not mask up, and show no proof that I am vaxxed. So stay wherever you are and do your thing, and I’ll do mine</p>

<li>I've already had covid and managed to survive it with a day of taking it easy and drinking lots of water.</li>
<li>I don't consider myself at a serious risk from covid, if reinfection is even possible.</li>
<li>The vaccine has not been shown to protect me from covid.</li>
<li>The vaccine has not been shown to stop me transmitting covid.</li>
<li>The vaccine has been shown to produce many, potentially lethal, side effects.</li>
<li>Getting the vaccine does not guarantee the government will start respecting my rights again.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's pretty much my line of reasoning; no risk from covid, no benefits from the vaccine.</p>

        <p>So does covid infection, and the risk is greater with covid than vaccination for each one of those. </p>
<p>This shouldn't be a surprise. Covid's negative effects are due to the body's immune response to it. The vaccine also produces a similar but much less harmful immune response. Any adverse effects from the vaccine are basically a much tamer preview of what actual covid infection would look like. </p>

        <p>Yes, for me it's a political question.  I think that if you're old and/or unhealthy and haven't had covid already, getting the vaccine makes a lot of sense.  If you're prone to worry (and are over 30), then it makes sense.</p>
<p>However, I am not going to bow to the tyranny of the incompetent and corrupt.  I am so thankful I live in the United States and there is enough resistance to make mandatory vaccination unthinkable here (so far).  If things get too bad in California, I am in a position to be able to move to a free state.  My heart goes out to those abroad who resist.  How can we help them?</p>

        <p>Because I've always had a level of intellectual curiosity that pushes me to deeply investigate everything the establishment tells me.</p>
<p>I WANT to know what whistleblowers are saying, so I can have an informed opinion.</p>
<p>If the establishment tells me "don't listen to that person," my immediate response is to listen to that person simply to HEAR what they're saying...not to neccesarily AGREE, but to listen.</p>
<p>And I can guarantee that I've spent FAR more time and energy reviewing and trying to understand everything I can about the rona and the vaxxes than 99% of the people who are accusing me of being "misinformed."</p>
<p>After hours and hours of research, and carefully considering the various viewpoints of countless researchers, health officials, epidemiologists, virologists, and other experts, I have concluded that I do not need the vaccine.</p>

        <p>The messaging is to prevent serious illness… but the overwhelming majority never get serious illness. The people who were most vulnerable are already vaccinated, so what’s the need to push it SO hard onto the populations that have substantially less risk? </p>
<p>On that note, have you noticed how discourse has shifted almost exclusively to cases and nothing else? The common pattern in many countries is a potentially sharp rise in cases, but deaths are at all-time lows so what gives?</p>

<p>If yes, I feel you are irresponsible with your pet.</p>
<p>If no, then why would you inject an experimental chemical cocktail into your bloodstream with the same statistic?</p>
<p>These are brand new, less than a year old experimental chemical cocktails that have not been through the full spectrum of health and safety tests. Other vaccines, like for influenza or chicken pox or measles or yellow fever have been out for decades and we know the pros and cons and potential side effects of them. With the Covid vaccines, there is <em>active measures suppressing true information about hazardous effects</em>. That last line would be all I would need to hear to convince that these experimental chemical cocktails are not safe yet.</p>
<p>If Covid is such a public health hazard and the vaccines are being funded via tax $$$, then why is there no government run program funded by taxes to stop diabetes? Why is there no door to door campaign to get parents to put their kids on diets?</p>

<p>You're right it actually causes cardiovascular adverse effects. Weird how you're afraid of the covid vaccine that has reports for a very minuscule result of cardiovascular effects compared to this. Interesting...</p>

        <p>It was 60% of hospitalizations were from fully vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Then the person who said that had to take it back and apparently they told him to reverse it and say that it was 60% were from unvaccinated. But at first he said 60% were from fully vaccinated, and he gave full justification for why it was fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>In other words, 60% really were fully vaccinated; they just told him to cover that up and lie, and either bribed with money, or threatened him; or did a combination of the two.</p>

        <p>Regarding 1) 
The wording is misleading. 
Out of 126 admissions, 
60% of admissions were completely unvaccinated (83)
And then of the remaining 40%, 23 people only had one jab. That leaves only 3 people who are fully vaccinated being admitted into the hospital from the super contagious delta variant.</p>
<p>Make of that information what you will. Downvote or whatever, but I can’t let y’all die from data illiteracy! </p>

        <p>I stopped being afraid of covid end of march 2020 and instead started to become afraid of our government, our media and our medical establishment.</p>
<p>That switch happened, when I first heard about critical voices being censored. I was curious what they said. Turned out what they said and what I wasn't supposed to hear was a lot more consistent and in line with my own observations.</p>

        <p>My brother would argue that I get all my info from "youtube" which I actually rarely even use.  This is such a great tool to support our claims.  It is nice to have a source with studies.  Many of the pro-vaxxers (God we need a new term than that) think we are not looking at peer reviewed studies or listening to experts in the field.  There is this trope that we are all dumb and conservative.  Many are conservative I believe (nothing wrong with that, to each their own), but I'm not and I know SOOOO many progressives that are saying no to the jab.</p>

        <p>Probably not what you are after, but I like calling them VACCINAZIS.  There have been lots of vaccine atrocities since WWII by the likes of the Gates foundation, etc, however what nobody can forget is that the WWII nazis medically experimented on people without their consent.  That's exactly what is being pushed for now.  Propaganda news idiots proclaiming life should be hard for unvaccinated people, that they should be mandatory, etc.  Vaccinazis all of them..</p>

        <p>All the propaganda. Stinks. Something is not right. The government has never cared so much about me or my family and they showed us quite clearly that they don't care about any non-covid related issues in the past few months - homelessness, mental health, addictions, leaving people to die without medical care, unaffordable medicine, DNR orders on the disabled, field hospitals built and then dismantled a month later and so on and so on. But now they want to save us? Yeah, and that creepy guy in a dark alleyway touching his crotch and stinking of alcohol just wants a loving relationship.</p>

        <p>exactly I'm so skeptical that billions have never been given to sex trafficking, homelessness, the rampant child abuse in this country (highest in industrialized nations I believe), universal Healthcare, lowering medical costs, and the so many other pressing human health and well-being issues </p>
<p>I'm supposed to believe the government suddenly has kindness and compassion in their hearts? 
and billionaire companies want my best interest? </p>
<p>yeah, no. </p>
<p>it's the lack of transparency for me. </p>
<p>if vaccination is about getting people back to work so the tax base and economy doesn't crumble, just say that. stop lying and acting like it's some sort of act of kindness and act or selflessness on the vaccinated people's part.</p>

        <p>I'm not against it. I happy for people to have it or not. I simply believe it should be their choice but unfortunately it is now being forced upon people with threats. </p>
<p>My current standing is I don't want it. I am fine with having to have it if you travel to other countries (like we have now for some viruses) </p>
<p>But to have it forced on you to partake in your own comunity is just wrong and illegal.</p>

        <p>Many people are no longer hesitant. Seeing the deception, censorship and growing body of data suggesting it is way less safe than advertised abd less efficient too and pretty much established data that CoVid is not dangerous, many are convinced not to take it, no matter the efforts taken to make them do it.</p>

        <p>And they died mainly because they were already unhealthy. They were already sick.</p>
<p>Dude people have died from auto accidents, and then their deaths were counted as covid deaths. COVID is not responsible for all these deaths.</p>
<p>People who went in for the flu or bronchitis who went to get medical treatment were labeled as “covid patients” and when they died, their deaths were counted as “covid deaths”.</p>

        <p>Candy is deadly, to a very small percentage of people.</p>
<p>That does not mean that candy is deadly.</p>
<p>When you say something is deadly, it is implied that it is deadly to pretty much the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>The covid shot is deadly.</p>
<p>The a vast majority of people. The reason we know this is because it causes clots throughout your entire body. Small clots. Microscopic. But guess what happens over time?</p>
<p>These small clots aggregate and form bigger clots. People who get these shots are screwed, unfortunately.</p>

        <p>but over 4.1 million people died from covid itself?</p>
<p>also, that's a 0.0001% mortality rate (yes, i calculated) for the vaccine which is much less than covid's 2% mortality rate.</p>

        <p>the survivability of the virus is over 99%.</p>
<p>why is that the ones who are at risk don;t self isolate?</p>
<p>and leave all of us live normal lives, without vaccines being shoved down our throats?</p>
<p>without mandatory lockdowns and mandatory masks?</p>
<p>also the fact that only 11k people died in US from a vaccine is absolutely crazy, only somebody without a brain would dismiss this as safe.</p>
<p>the side effects include literally death, if you wanna give it a try then go ahead but dont drag everybody into this.</p>

        <p>For me, it started as simply "this is rushed, I'll wait a year or two and see how others are doing". I didn't wanna be a beta tester for big pharma. Especially on brand new tech (mrna). But now with how hard and... <em>sinisterly</em> they are pushing it, I just flat out don't trust it. They (the government, not the ambiguous 'they') have been lying from day one. I have absolutely no reason to think they are taking the truth now.</p>

        <p>The countless victims I’ve seen get terrible long lasting side effects. I’m not sure about what the number of deaths from it is now but last time I checked it was 1000s. Even if you ignore all that as <em>rare</em> (it’s also rare that you even get side effects from covid itself never mind die) ask yourself why the vaccines are being pushed so hard. You’re being urged. BY THE GOVERNMENT. Ads everywhere. Why are they so desperate for us to get a new experimental vaccine(s) for a respiratory flu with a 99%+ survival rate? It’s really sketchy… Plus knowing your history about new vaccines, will make you more hesitant. Like the first polio vaccine, yikes. I’m not comparing the two, polio was way worse and actually needed a vaccine. Also, why are private companies making their own? Soon there’s gonna be a Mars vaccine and a Coca cola vaccine. These companies have no liability for whatever their vaccine might do to you. That itself is super sketchy, if it’s so safe and important, why remove all liability? At the end of the day, it’s your choice and you live with those consequences. Because the governments or companies sure don’t give a shit.</p>

        <p>I don't trust the pharmaceutical industry. A review of their checkered past should leave any reasonable person with the same skepticism. I also don't trust the government. A review of their checkered past should leave any reasonable person with the same skepticism.</p>
<p>So when two massive, powerful institutions of dubious character come together and start demanding things of me, I'm at maximum skepticism.  And ultimately, I've considered the risk of covid to me and my family. We're young and healthy. It's just not a danger to us.  Why would I subject myself to the whims of entities I don't trust to protect me from a contagion that I wouldn't even terribly mind contracting.  </p>
<p>For me covid is about as dangerous as the flu. For my young children, the flu is actually more dangerous.  Why risk long-term side effects (we <strong>literally cannot know</strong> what they may be at this point in the experiment) over something that presents no danger to me and mine.</p>
<p>Also, if the "vaccine" were some dead covid material that I could blow up my nose like an old-timey inoculation, I would take it. It's not that.</p>

        <p>Over 40% of covid hospitalizations in the UK are double vaccinated people. Side effects of vaccines. I want to avoid getting covid as much as possible but feel the drugs on the market to cure it have been around forever and have less adverse effects than the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I am healthy, young, and in good shape. I have zero risk factors that would lead to severe viral outcomes. I prefer my T Cells and potential subsequent antibodies to destroy corona viruses naturally (like they have done for my 40+ years on earth), thus making my immune system stronger. “Asymptomatic spread” is a fallacy and if in a year and a half I have not gotten sick other than a 2 day flu in Feb ‘20 and seasonal allergies. In the extremely unlikely event that I do end up getting the symptoms of Covid-19, I will stay home for 2 weeks (as to not spread it to loved ones or work mates) while taking zinc and Vitamin D, and will call my doctor and have him prescribe either ivermectin or HCQ which are both benign yet extremely effective in destroying corona viruses.</p>

        <p>If your old and/or infirm then the risk/reward is in your favour to take it, possibly. </p>
<p>I am a healthy person who makes the sacrifice of taking care of themselves. I do this by eating right, exercising and even developing a meditation routine. I don’t drink or do drugs (although I think all drugs should be legal but that’s another issue). I have a low chance of having COVID complications should I contract it. In addition, I have contemplated and accepted that I will die someday, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, maybe in the distant future, who knows?</p>
<p>The most important thing to me is that I live a life that’s authentic and I am true to myself. I do not want to live my life in FEAR and be a lier. </p>
<p>If I take the vaccine and I have adverse reactions to it, the company who made the vaccine 💉 does not take responsibility, the government does not take responsibility and internet warrior Redditor’s do not take responsibility. Who then takes the responsibility? Me. Then I shall make the decision. There will be nobody to wipe my arse if I get bedridden and I’m shitting myself constantly. I don’t care how remote the possibility. </p>
<p>Pay me $2,000,000 if I get the vaccine and get seriously ill and I’ll take it. WHY NOT? If it’s THAT safe. </p>
<p>I now (it used to frustrate me) find it amusing that ‘normal’ people who push the vaccine have a rudimentary knowledge of science (at best) tell me to get the vaccine (I’m no virologist but I do have a degree in microbiology). Their only argument is an appeal to authority. That’s not good enough. I don’t trust the types of people that governments and states attract and there is CLEARLY an attempt to purge any scientist who doesn’t follow the narrative ( Robert Malone but there are many others). So this doesn’t fill me with confidence, in relation to those politicians that ummm … ‘want the best for me.’ I’m sure it has nothing to do with gaining and consolidating more power 🤯 (don’t let a good crisis go to waste)</p>
<p>Trials have been skipped, it’s a relatively new technology and we don’t know what the long term effects will be because…… they’re long term. </p>
<p>P.S. the HATE that comes from the pro COVID camp is reprehensible and only makes me sure that deep down they don’t believe what they are doing the right thing and attack us because we remind them they are not doing the right thing. They don’t have the courage to face the truth.</p>

<p>Man, this is powerful and motivational! I feel pumped reading this! Thanks for sharing this, I really needed to read this right now as I’m trying my best to keep this mindset. Especially in light of the UK announcing the advent of vaccine passports, and our neighbour, France, doing the same. </p>

        <p>Main reasons why you should never take a covid vaccine (not hesitancy, but refusal):</p>
<p>1) The virus has a 99.9X% survival rate. X depending on your age. For example, if you are young and healthy X is 9 (and many nines following).</p>
<p>2) The companies that are producing mRNA vaccines are veryyy sketchy. They have paid billions of dollars paid in court fines for bribing doctors and  conducting unlawful experiments.</p>
<p>3) mRNA technology is untested. It's been tested on some simple animals like ferrets or whatever, which are nothing like humans genetic material wise. </p>
<p>4) Lots and lots of money involved. By lots I mean trillions of dollars. Those trillions are enough to buy every single powerful government on Earth. Those that are not powerful are threatened so they must follow the agenda. </p>
<p>5) Big pharma has been conducting experiments on general population ever since the first Rockefeller twisted the definition of medicine, by bankrupting every school that taught traditional medicine with carefully planned propaganda, and after that funding drug companies. By traditional medicine I don't mean shamanism and weeds, I mean medicine not dependant on vaccines, heavy drugs, pills for everything etc.
One good example of global experimentation is Bayer inventing heroin and selling it as cough syrup. Yep, the most powerful pharmaceutical company invented the most dangerous drug.</p>
<p>6) Heavy censorship of alternatives. </p>
<p>7) This is not the first time a global movement is funded by various sources all over the globe. Fascism, nazism, communism. They were all funded by somebody with money and power. Germany was dead broke a couple years before WW2.</p>

        <p>All good reasons here. Personally it’s like everyone else says but I would like to add that I am already suspicious of a government that likes to power grab, but the fact that they are actively engaged with private corporations to censor or suppress various doctors, experts, or just the average citizen from engaging in discourse about these shots should send up massive red flags. Plus the fact they are pushing and bribing and incentivizing so hard is another. This two things by themselves should tell you all you need to know.</p>

        <p>Anything that requires this much propaganda is very suspicious. Take that with the censoring of anybody who says ANYTHING remotely negative about them. Even the /r/covidvaccinated sub is like 90% censored, by people who are pro (covid) vaxx.</p>
<p>Also, I'm previous service, and am generally pro vaccine. Just not this. Not with this much pressure and coercion. I feel it is my duty as a man to take a stand.</p>

much that doesn’t add up. 
Starting with the actual chance of anyone globally getting corona and dying from it is 0.04% which every single person in the world could calculate right now with all the “official” numbers available, well thats where i think everyone should start questioning what really is going on.</p>

        <p>I grew up being taught by everyone that these large pharma companies were bad news. They were some of the most exploitative businesses on earth and made massive profits by prolonging sickness and hiking prices. Now, all of a sudden, if you don't bow down you're an enemy of the state, fuck that. Also, there are genuine concerns about the vaccine and it's ramifications. People have died, had very bad reactions. The process was rushed. When trump was president, no one wanted "trumps vaccine", now it's Biden and you're killing your family if you don't get it. The whole thing is just fucking bullshit and I'm tired of playing</p>

        <p>Right now the risk outweighs the reward. No long term data. No liability. It won't keep you from getting or spreading covid. 
Combine all that with the fact that if I do get covid, there's almost a one hundred percent chance that I'll be ok. I'm not going to get a vaccine for something I'm not worried about catching in the first place.</p>

<p>Pfizer animal testing document that was obtained by Dr. Byram Bridle through a FOI request to the Japanese government which shows the biodistribution of the lipid-nano particles throughout the bodies and organs of the test subjects. This is evidence that the lipid nanoparticles do not stay in the injecton site, but instead travel all throughout the body (go to pg 16/23 for the charts showing biodistribution over the course of 48hrs):
https://files.catbox.moe/0vwcmj.pdf</p>
<p>Addendum to the above link. This blog post provides easy to understand information (with pictures) on the make-up of the lipid nanoparticles used in the Covid19 vaccines. It shows that the pharmaceutical companies could have designed them to have targeting ligands on the outside, so that the nanoparticles would only transfect the muscle cells. But instead the vax was designed with PEG polymers on the outside, so that the immune system will not be able to pick them up and put them in the trash. The PEG is what Byram Bridle says is the reason the vaccine travels throughout the body and since it does not have targeting ligands, it can transfect any type of cell:

        <p>1) COVID is no more dangerous than the flu for a person like me (early 30's; excellent physical health; no pre-existing conditions). I don't take the flu shot and I've never had issues, so why do I have to take the COVID shot?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>2) There are a number of unknowns with the COVID vaccine...</p>
<p>-It hasn't been approved by the FDA for non-emergency use yet, so it's still essentially in an "experimental" phase</p>
<p>-No long-term clinical trials have been completed on the vaccine yet, so we have no clue what the long-term effects are (Google "Gardasil long-term effects" and you'll realize how another supposedly "safe" drug was discovered to have horrible long-term effects)</p>
<p>-There have been a lot of stories getting out about short-term side effects. Most of them are mild, but some of them are crippling. If COVID is 99% safe, and the vaccine is "probably" 99% safe, why should I trust the vaccine more than my own immune system to beat COVID?</p>
<p>-mRNA vaccines are still a new and experimental treatment, and there are too many unknowns. One of the men mainly responsible for the creation of mRNA vaccines is not completely confident in their safety and ability to work, especially for young and healthy people</p>
<p>-The "spike protein" issue with the vaccine and all the potential unknowns/risks from that</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>3) When you combine #1 and #2...using risk management and critical thinking, I've come to the conclusion that it seems more risky to me to get the vaccine than it is for me to trust my immune system to fight off COVID and make a complete recovery</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>4) There is WAY too much shady stuff going on behind the scenes with this vaccine.</p>
<p>-There is blatant censorship being done by media and Big Tech over anything that's even innocently questioning of how dangerous the vaccine is or isn't, as well as how dangerous COVID is or isn't. Only one narrative is allowed...COVID will kill us all and you MUST get vaccinated! If I'm not allowed to even question the narrative, that really makes me think there's an ulterior motive to this narrative.</p>
<p>-I find it very odd that our governments are suddenly willing to shill out trillions of dollars so that its citizens can get injected with a free vaccine for a virus that has a 99% survival rate, but it's not willing to do the same for things like insulin or cancer treatment...why are they pushing this particular drug/vaccine so hard? When has government actually cared about the well-being and safety of its citizens?</p>
<p>-It's extremely draconian/authoritarian to be suggesting that citizens can't be allowed to participate in society if they aren't vaccinated. Vaccine passports, mandatory vaccinations, and health cards are no different than the "papers please" system that exist in fascist/authoritarian societies like what we saw in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. I will die fighting before I allow myself to be a part of an evil society like that.</p>
<p>-The governments of the world have waived all liability exposure for the manufacturers of the drugs. That's a HUGE red flag to me.</p>
<p>Based on all of these shady things (and more), I feel morally obligated to not get vaccinated because I can't go along with the actions of power-crazed authoritarians who obviously don't care about safety...they just want power.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>5) The marketing roll-out of the vaccine has been the most inept, most ridiculous, and most insidious roll out I've ever seen. Threats, then bribes (million-dollar lotteries, free doughnuts, free burgers and beer, etc.), then blackmail (more lockdowns and restrictions)...NONE of that should even be on the table if the virus was actually that dangerous and the vaccine was actually that effective. By following this method, they've actually deterred me from getting vaccinated. Think of it this way...</p>
<p>If I was in a bar, and someone suddenly offered to give me a brand new type of drink because of something in the bar that has a 0.1% chance of hurting me, I would probably thank them for the consideration, have them put the drink next to me, and then I would think about it before deciding whether or not the drink was a good idea for me. If some people in the bar suddenly started harassing and insulting me for not IMMEDIATELY taking the drink, I would start to get suspicious. If other people in the bar started to get nervous and think I wasn't going to take the drink, I would get even more suspicious. Finally, if people started offering me bribes or started blackmailing me if I didn't take the drink, then I would have become thoroughly convinced there was something wrong with the drink and I would throw it away.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

        <p>I don’t trust big pharmacy and I don’t trust the government. They don’t have our best interests at heart. With that said, I’m not a complete “no” on the vaccine yet. My wife and I are going to wait for a bit to decide if we’re going to take it or not.  We live in a country with a relatively low rate of serious covid illness or death. I’m originally from America and thus read American news to see what’s going on in that part of the world. </p>
<p>With that said I’m extremely against any type of vaccine passport. I think if people would like to get the vaccine, that’s great, and they should get it. But we should not vilify people who are hesitant, who won’t get it for any reason whatsoever. If the vaccine truly works as it’s supposed to (which we’re finding out it doesn’t really), vaccinated people would protect the unvaccinated. </p>
<p>It’s my opinion that the US government and media have completely botched the marketing of this vaccine. It shouldn’t have ever been political, but it is now. You want more people to get the vaccine?  Then stop threatening them and telling them they’re bad people who are on the wrong side of history. It’s sickening.</p>

        <p>If they are healthy they may think it is an unnecessary medical procedure. Many also feel it was rushed, skipped animal trials and therefor may have long-term, or short-term, negative effects. Also, the manufacturer has legal immunity which makes many people uncomfortable in the event something bad happens. But mostly it's about force: if it works and is needed then why are they pushing this on everyone so hard?</p>

        <p>Here's my Top 10:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm still alive. My family members are still alive. My friends are still alive. I personally don't know anyone who had it and died from it. At most, my wife's sister's co-worker's relative supposedly died from it.</li>
<li>My wife's sister had it while she was pregnant. Meaning her husband and two kids and unborn child most likely had it as well. None of them died from it.</li>
<li>In my county alone, the official stats (a .gov site) states that 57 people died from COVID-19 (when I last checked two months ago).</li>
<li>I don't trust government, and I don't trust people who "run" governments, In fact, I despise them. The majority are liars and hypocrites, and in my country (the U.S.A.), they break the articles of the U.S. Constitution in one form or another.</li>
<li>I don't trust anyone in a position of wealth and power who has influence over government, when they've outwardly stated harmful intentions. These are the Bill Gates, George Soros, and Klaus Schwab's of the world (and many others).</li>
<li>When there's censorship occurring, I look at who's doing the censoring, and their reasons why. If there's no opposing argument except for sophist remarks supporting totalitarian, authoritarian, or fascist dictates, then I know I am opposed to it.</li>
<li>I can easily see the propaganda. I call it a plandemic.</li>
<li>Here's a list of COVID-19 "vaccine" adverse events back in October 22, 2020 by the FDA: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download</a> and they skipped over it in a livestream: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XTiL9rUpkg&amp;t=9220s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XTiL9rUpkg&amp;t=9220s</a>. I have a greater risk in receiving an adverse event than dying from COVID-19.</li>
<li>I worked in the IT industry as a Quality Assurance Engineer. I reached the peak of my career a decade ago. I worked at big name corporations like Microsoft, Raytheon-BBN Technologies, and AIG. Every product has bugs, and every product with known medium to high severity bugs still get released. This is because most of the time is in development, the least amount of time in testing, and the decision to release is in interest of the stake holders - not the people working on the product. These are products that have been in development for years, not months. Have you ever noticed every new game you pay $60 or more for new, is loaded with bugs? Why would you pay for a game where you pay to test the game, so that in 6 months to a year, they release a patch to fix most of the bugs from their initial release, and the cost gets lowered to $25?</li>
<li>The mask mandates, lockdowns, and vaccine passports are a form of authoritarian control, and it's in nearly every country. Aside from the Antarctic Treaty, when has nearly every country agreed upon the same thing?</li>

        <p>I deeply mistrust a drug that's being forced on me for a virus I have a 99+% chance of surviving. </p>
<p>Look around you, look at the level of coercion, the propaganda and the outright threats all coming from government. That's never happened, not even for smoking or drugs or drunk driving. And COVID is less dangerous for the majority than smoking.</p>
<p>And lots of places already have the 70%+ they say they need, but has that changed anything? No, now they're introducing vaccine checks to go shopping!</p>
<p>And countries like Canada are contracted to buy boosters through 2024. Why? How do they know that's necessary?</p>
<p>There's something really wrong with this picture, so I want to wait and see how it progresses. I'm not taking the irreversible step of a shot when they're so desperate to push it on me. </p>

        <p>I don't have any rational, health based reason to take it. I have recovered from Covid and it was really not that bad. A couple of the flus I've had before have been MUCH worse, but this was the only one from which I lost my sense of smell for 4 days. I don't go out a lot to "endanger" other people's health and have no problem staying in until recovery. There have been 100+ cases recorded in my building since March 2020 and all have recovered. And that is probably underreported by far.</p>
<p>The more I listen to the media, the more it makes me feel that the jab ain't that bad, but I keep always questioning what are the reasons to get it. I can really feel and acknowledge that media indeed does have an influence on me despite not providing non-manipulative reasons. There is lots of hidden and not-so-hidden blame and shame going on, and that is what turns on my critical thinking. Yet they fail to provide a convincing MEDICAL reason as to why I should get it.</p>
<p>I am not a psychologist, but I am curious in observing the psychological effects on the messaging on media and social media alike. I have seen many vaccine hesitant people get exhausted and give up. Many of my friends are afraid they will not be able to travel without the shot. Some are really scared they will not be able to get a job without it. Family members turning against each other for refusing the jab. Are those reasons medical? Nope. Yet they give into peer pressure and for their own comfort. Most of those people are non-thinkers and tend to seek for social approval and rely on guidance from others. After all, that is in the culture here.</p>
<p>Then there is the statistical data. The more I dig into statistics, the less reasons there are to get it. Statistics and real world research data is the only thing that will give us what is closest to the truth. They don't have any emotion or opinion attached to them. Yes, they can be skewed, so that is why it is important to dig into many different sources. But in most cases the data is in almost in direct contradiction with the popular opinion. When in doubt, wait for more data before making a decision.</p>
<p>Lastly, I am pro choice. If our right to choose is taken away from us now, what will prevent it from being taken away again in the future? Pretty sure it's not the same people who gave away their rights in the first place.</p>

        <p>I have a family member that died after taking it. I have a friend that got a PE after taking it. I have another friend who has been bedridden since early June and is currently in the hospital as she couldn’t take the nerve pain last night and went to the ER. </p>
<p>I am healthy and young. If I get Covid I’ll most likely survive (99% likely).</p>
<p>I’d rather my naturally immunity take care of me rather than pump myself with experimental, non-FDA approved chemicals.</p>

        <p>I commend your effort to look at the other side, it’s uncommon in this day and imo shouldn’t have to be praised, but positive reinforcement usually leads to better outcomes</p>
<p>As others have said, the lack of liability if harmed is suspicious (putting it lightly), it’d be like not being able to sue a meat packing plant or company for food that made you seriously ill. </p>
<p>The other big one is the companies producing these shots have a history of dangerous products that they hide, off the top of my head J&amp;J’s Baby Powder and more recent Sunscreen, and Pfizer having to pay out $2.3 Billion for bribing doctors to not come forward with the side-effects and complications their medicine posed.</p>
<p>And that’s not to forget these vaccines are under Emergency Use Authorization only, not approved by any government body and legally can’t until 2023-2030. Anyone forcing these onto others is at odds with most scientific proceedings.</p>

        <p>Here's a few reasons:
1. It doesn't protect you against covid, just lowers your symptoms and entitles you to a vaccine passport, which is pretty much slavery of the highest form imaginable.
2. It's not backed up by tests/trials.
3. People are literally dying from it.
4. It's forced on people.
5. By now it's no secret that the virus was lab made and released on purpose in order to vaccinate humanity. Question is - why in the fuck? 
6. The covid virus mutates every 10 hours or so (correct me if I'm wrong) so the vaccine won't help.
7. If you get injected, you loose your natural immunity, which means that you'll have to get vaccinated for EVERYTHING. And that will come with a whole bunch of side effects and you'll need medicine to fight those side effects, and the medicine will give you more side effects and you'll need more-.. you get the idea.
8. Covid is fake (not the virus itself but the situation).  Virologists have been talking about it since 2008, and Moderna had patents for covid vaccine since 2015, which proves that this whole situation was staged.
9. The creator of mrna vaccines speaks against them himself and is constantly being silenced by the media.</p>

        <p>I read somewhere that the vaccine companies get something like $32-$37 for each vaccine. There are 7.6 billion people on earth and apparently each one needs 2 vaccines. Let's say the average is $35 each. So $70 for every human. I'm not very good at math so I may be wrong but in my head I figure that's something like $53 trillion dollars. </p>
<p>I don't trust very much when big money is involved whether it be war, politics, big tech, or even vaccines. If big money is to be made, I don't trust those behind it and pushing it. </p>
<p>I have also read articles from 2018 and earlier. It doesn't make sense to me how mRNA vaccine technology went from having people fired on the spot for failed tests to saving the world in a few short years. I don't trust the media right now so I like to go back and read articles from the past. </p>
<p>People used to know that regulatory capture was a thing. People used to know that the FDA was crooked and that pharmaceuticals could be dangerous. </p>
<p>These vaccines are not FDA approved and are still doing trials and will for years to come. So no one knows the long term effects. </p>
<p>I don't trust that adverse events are being reported properly. I don't trust that vaccine deaths are being reported in the mainstream news properly. </p>
<p>Basically, it all comes down to trust. I don't trust any of it. Media, politicians, big pharma, big tech, the elites. I trust none of them because I know they do not have my family's best interest in mind.</p>

        <p>The trial was rushed. No long term safety data. Vaccines can spark autoimmune disease. People under 85 and with no major comorbidites have very low risk. No liability taken by the companies. AND biggest of all for me is that there is a a coordinated effort by Pharma companies and big tech so censor alternatives like HCQ,  Ivermectin, high dose Vitamin D which then granted them the ability to use Emergency Use Authorization which they shouldn't have been able to do.</p>

        <p>the fact you call it 'the vaccine' when it isnt even a vaccine at all is one problem. its like playing russian roulette with your dna that you can never undo. also having had covid made it very easy to decide against it for me. super mild</p>

        <p><strong>First and most important point: our governments have a history of destructive lies.</strong></p>
<p>If your government was a person, they would easily qualify as a violent sociopath. You'd have no reason to trust them and every reason not to.</p>
<p>In that context, here are general reasons why we don't want the vaccine:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system maliciously allowed covid into your country, while initially downplaying the risks</li>
<li>Then they switched gears and used a bunch of tricks to inflate the death count of covid,</li>
<li>While destroying your economy with lockdowns that aren't even shown to work.</li>
<li>They made no mention of the collective loss of prosperity, health, and sanity from lockdowns.</li>
<li>They constantly jerked you around with nonsensical rule changes to keep you off-balanced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, as we all predicted, they:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rushed a vaccine to market,</li>
<li>Skipping the normal FDA multi-year trials,</li>
<li>Using a treatment that had consistently terrible effects in animal trials,</li>
<li>That doesn't even work. It's not technically a "vaccine;" it's a treatment.</li>
<li>They did all of this while suppressing existing, potentially potent treatments</li>
<li>and ruthlessly censoring information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the vaccines are widely available,</p>
<ul>
<li>They are downplaying the side effects or gaslighting you and telling you they don't exist,</li>
<li>While pushing the vaccine on young people who have no business taking it,</li>
<li>While propagandizing normal people into hating people who don't take the vaccine,</li>
<li>And planning to implement disgustingly authoritarian measures for dissenters.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think it's hyperbole to say that your government is engaged in physical and psychological abuse against you and your fellow citizens, of which the vaccine push is a horrifying escalation.</p>

        <p>Because you still can get it, spread it to others. If you can do that, what’s the point? </p>
<p>People who are vaccinated should still be treated like the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Low risk groups recover, with the same long term issues as unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Viruses mutate. They always do. They tend to become less dangerous, unless resisted, and are forced to mutate stronger to survive.</p>
<p>The scientific method was not fully applied to development. Criticism of scientists should be weighed, that is how new and better discoveries happen.</p>
<p>Any and all information regarding side effects are downplayed or outright censored. If the vaccine was a truly effective means of prevention, why silence people? Wouldn’t neighbors, friends and family be enough to convince? </p>
<p>Beyond government overreach, the fact that all of the science is owned by special interest groups, that does not make medical decisions easy.</p>
<p>The heart inflammation caused should give greater concern, yet people are silenced about it.</p>
<p>Allergies. Some people are very allergic to the vaccine. It’s a weird Russian roulette for those who have allergic responses to many things. And no, giving a allergy shot doesn’t always work.</p>
<p>Is there a ongoing controlled study that is open and transparent on the vaccine that isn’t owned by the very developers of vaccines? Where are the long term studies on humans? </p>
<p>Failures of transparency to the public and political involvement, along with pharmaceutical companies who are notorious for hurting or killing people are in charge. To many people, that is a frightening aspect.</p>
<p>Many people who don’t want THIS vaccine, are fully inoculated, and are pro vaccine. It isn’t a matter of which vaccine or choice of type, it is the lack of long term studies to see what new technology actually does. </p>
<p>Politics. These are government entities. They are NOT doctors. And for a world wide pandemic, it is unbelievably ignorant, not to have a unbiased and balanced group of scientists to debate and independently share and record their findings without threat of death, of censorship, so they can actually do their job.</p>
<p>The press. They are nothing more than a hotspot of inconsistency and fear porn.</p>
<p>Lawsuits. Some people have died by over the counter products that no one knew could kill, until years later and fighting an uphill battle to get heard. Pharmaceutical lawsuits have to be class action or nothing is done. My mother was a victim of pharmaceutical companies not doing their jobs regarding a product with severe risks.</p>
<p>They aren’t doing control studies. Unbiased. And the political powers that be, see this as a partnership with a never ending cash cow.</p>
<p>I trust science. Science has helped billions and killed billions. I trust them to actually do scientific research to and report failures. That is part of science. Failures lead to success. But when it is rushed it is the same as dusting DDT on everyone and saying “The science is settled.” </p>
<p>When science is “Settled”, we are set back to the dark ages, with the town crier shouting the proclamation, “All is well”. </p>

        <p>The answer is the same as with any other medicine: use the least amount of drug load to get the desired effect.</p>
<p>If someone is sad should they immediately go on SSRIs?</p>
<p>If someone has a cough do they need to start an inhaler?</p>
<p>If someone bruises their knee do they need opiates?</p>
<p>If you aren't at high risk for covid, getting a vaccine that has not passed phase 3 clinical trials (and won't for years) seems like a terrible misjudgment of risk analysis.</p>
<p>I won't tell anyone to NOT get the vaccine, but it's asinine to imply everyone needs it and/or those who don't get it are being bad people.</p>
<p>This isn't even mentioning the weird propaganda and censorship around it</p>

        <p>I can only speak from my own experience, but the way the government in my current country of residence was pushing their two "acceptable" vaccines, and wildly and dishonestly presenting the "danger" of everything else, completely contrary to the data being shown by pretty much every other EU country, including my own. I decided to get vaccinated with the "bad" one that is being recommended by my own country.</p>
<p>This will probably mean i wont be able to get the vaccine passport when i return to work after vacation. But to be honest, i dont want anything to do with that fascist garbage anyway.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it has to do with the rabid mentality its being forced on people. Vaccines needs to be spread by education, not at gunpoint. Threatening peoples livelihood and human rights, and sending armed government agents to terrorize them is not the right way.</p>
<p>If the worlds governments has been open and honest with every risk, not tried censoring dissent and not tried to force it on people, a lot more people would take it.</p>

I am not hesitating. I won't get it. simple as.<br>
perfectly healthy 33yo. severe illness from COVID is as likely for me as it is from the flu. not getting flu vaccination either.  </p>
<p>I'd rather catch COVID and recover naturally then take my chances with a vaccine that causes random death or other sideffects.<br>
its a numbers game for me.  </p>
<p>now with new research from germany that suggest up to 80% of people never even notice they had a SARS-CoV-2 infection and that mild cases still give immunity there is even less reason to get the "vaccine".  </p>
<p>the only thing I may consider getting is Sinovacs CoronaVac.<br>

        <p>In addition to everything I read so far, I think health science has become myopic with vaccines. There are other things that boost immunity and prevent/treat illness, yet there is little to no research on these things. There is simply no money in them. There is, however, untold billions to be made in vaccines. It's a cash cow with zero liability. Why SHOULD I trust it? This isn't about health. This is about control and money.</p>

        <p>The better question is why are people so eager to take a vaccine for something that is similar to the flu. Flu vaccines exist. Most people don't take them every year because they only cover the most common variants, and wear off fairly quickly. The same is true of the covid vaccine.</p>
<p>Really, everything about the covid vaccine is pure social forcing and peer pressure. There's nothing else to it, if you're logical and rational about it you can make a personal decision as to whether it makes sense for you, but most people aren't doing that, they are just going along to not bother their peer groups and family--and if they don't, the government is trying to intimidate them (sometimes in rather extreme ways) into taking it.</p>

        <p>My Doctor said he does not recommend it.</p>
<p>It is not a Real Vaccine.  Real Vaccines contain dead inactive parts of the pathogen so the body and react to it and naturally develop the antibodies.  This is an mRNA Treatment, we have No idea the long term effects of this treatment.  </p>
<p>Since I have already had a stroke and and prone to them I do not want to risk increasing my chances by taking any experimental treatment that does not have any significant benefit to me.  Blood Clots kill.  </p>
<p>And lastly and most importantly <strong>I HAVE ALREADY HAD COVID19!!</strong> I am already immune.</p>
<p>I already have the same protection if not better from natural immunity than I will from any vaccine.  Anyway the "Vaccines" are proving not to be effective against the variants, so no one can claim that the mRNA treatment is better than natural immunity.  </p>
<p>I am immunocompromised and have enough Neurological disorders because of it.<br>
My immune system if triggered by some pathogens will attack the blood vessels in my brain causing Seizure, Stroke or possibly Coma or Death.  </p>
<p>Already experienced the first 2 back in 2018 from the FLU  </p>
<p>It was after the Brain Surgery(Brian Biopsy), and several rounds of Chemotherapy to kill off my immune system and being on a large dose of Immune Suppressants I was told when asked if I should be wearing a Mask in public.  I was told in no uncertain terms with the studies to back up his words  -<strong>NO.</strong>  They do not help stop the spread of disease, there is no point wearing a mask and just to live my life normally.  </p>
<p>I am just listening to my Doctors who know me personally.</p>
<p>The TV doctors and politicians don't know or care about me at all, why should I listen to what they have to say when it goes against the advice of my own doctors?</p>

        <p>I think I can offer an interesting perspective as I took the vaccine and believe in its effectiveness for my particular age group. It’s simple - are you familiar with the story of the boy who cried wolf?  The government - Democratic Party - media conglomerate in the US has CLEARLY and OBVIOUSLY lied so many times and so blatantly it’s only natural that EVERYTHING of importance is a lie.  So my opinion is that this complicated medical decision is getting oversimplified by lying Media and people aren’t buying it.</p>

        <p>I do not trust pharmaceutical companies. They have enormous profit motive and zero liability. Ever single one has had, at some point in their recent history, a huge fine involving coverup, false marketing, suppressing drugs, etc.</p>
<p>These fines are in the multiple millions and rarely billions of dollars, but they’re are a mere cost of doing business because they are making money hand over fist.</p>
<p>As someone ‘in the thick of it’ (though not front line any more) I believe the pharmaceutical industry is too cozy with medicine’s business side, and not patient outcomes and best practice. Make a pill from problem X and sell it, sell a pill to fix the side effects.</p>
<p>IMO everyone should view anything written by and published by a pharmaceutical company as hostile and biased information.</p>
<p>This does NOT dismiss the work of the individual scientist and researchers and doctors at these conglomerates. I am certain there are indeed quiet heroic geniuses at work at these places. Their work I’m sure is sound and honest, including full risk vs benefit analysis, side effects, etc.</p>
<p>The problem arises when that raw factual information is filtered through multiple layers of bullshit from legal to marketing to the CEO’s personal preferences,</p>

        <p>It was a non-issue for me from the start. The more I learned about it, the more I went from don't-care to wtf-no-way. I don't watch TV; I've watched hours and hours of video interviews with courageous doctors and read reams of public documents and seen too many <a href="https://www.medscape.com/sites/public/covid-19/vaccine-insights/how-concerned-are-you-about-vaccine-related-adverse-events">stories of ruined lives</a>. There is basically no aspect of it that passes the smell test. And beside all that, the vaccine was developed for a specific strain that is all but extinct now.</p>
<p>Frankly, I don't understand how anyone could have been induced to take it, like lambs to slaughter.</p>

        <p>I want to start off by saying that even if this was some legit miracle drug that actually worked and genuinely made me healthier, and it was still be pushed on us the way this vax has been, I would still refuse it. Because it’s about manipulation, coercion, and deceit. </p>
<p>It’s not just with the vaccine, either. “Scientific” exploitation has affected food recommendations, it’s affected the environment, and oh yea it’s been affecting the very same drug companies since the beginning of their existence (source: biochemical engineer who literally learned about all of the scum behavior of the pharmacy industry in a bioethics course). </p>
<p>Now, about the actual vaccine. First off, lipid nanoparticles. Unstable lipids are absolutely terrible for our cells internal energy production systems. </p>
<p>Second, spike proteins. First off, spike proteins are inflammatory in nature. Dr Malone and others have shown evidence/proof/source of the very fact that the lipid nanoparticles, which contain the genetic information that encode for the production of spike proteins, are not just staying in the shoulder injection site. They’re circulating through the body, concentrating in scary places like the ovaries and marrow for example. That is so fucking terrifying. In essence, this transient occurrence means that inflammation is being brought to these vital sectors of the body.</p>
<p>Now I want to touch on the dogma of biology. DNA-&rt;RNA-&rt;protein. That was how it was thought to be for a long time until we learned that certain things (viruses for example) can reverse the transcription process and go from rna to dna. Let’s just entertain that this could happen inside of our bodies, beyond the scope of what “experts” say. </p>
<p>Then not only are spike proteins being produced all over the body, but the genetic instructions for producing these inflammatory proteins might possibly be incorporated into our genetic code, leading to more production of inflammatory proteins, leading to more inflammation, repeat the process. </p>
<p>If we take a loot at a lot of the negative reactions being reported, we see heart problems, neurodegenerative issues (twitching), skin rashes, and even death. The thing is, these are all short term reactions. This isn’t just accidental, it’s my fear that these people are responding more readily to the heightened inflammatory reactions happening in their bodies. So then, what might happen in 5 years, 10 years, 15 years? </p>
<p>It’s not vaccine hesitancy for me, it’s about rejection against putting something in my body that actually scares me. It’s about standing up against blatantly obvious manipulation of the masses carried out through the media. It’s about being a part of a positive change for our society so that one day, when we have kids, they can grow up in a world full of love and not fear. </p>
<p>If we can start to open up people’s eyes to the manipulation, then suddenly that very manipulation will lose all of its power. And that’s when we can start to shape the world we want to live in. </p>
<p>TLDR; censorship, coercion, manipulation, and push for vaccine is enough to make me say hell no. But add to it the fact that I genuinely think the thing is dangerous then, need I say more?</p>

        <p>I am a nurse and have seen everything from myocarditis, heart failure, arrhythmia, seizure, and death from the vaccine. Just saying that will get me censored/banned on social media. People who are victims are also begging to be heard. But the vaccine lotteries, and vaccine passport news and fear porn of the deaths drown out their voices. And that is a huge red flag. It doesn’t matter if it was trump or Biden I wouldn’t have taken it. It was rushed, it’s a novel vaccine etc. we were told to fear the novel cv (99.97 survival rate or most people) yet we should jump at a novel vaccine? 
The vax manufacturers are not liable for any damages, and there are cheap medications already on the market that stop viral replication, but these medications and drs who discuss this are censored to oblivion as well. So I guess that sums it up for me. I can’t share links of ppl with actual issues bc I’m sure I’d get banned but it is not hard to find.</p>

        <p>Because I have natural antibodies which slightly diminish but never go away entirely and quickly ramp up if I get virus again. The government lies constantly since forever. Pfizer made over $15B from this experimental gene therapy (it’s not a vaccine look up the definition) it only has an “EUA” which is not FDA approval again look it up. It was produced from a military research lab through gain of function research (confirmed) Dr Steven Quay gave a congressional sworn testimony confirming it was a lab created virus and dude if that isn’t enough to arouse your suspicion then may the lord help you friend because I cannot.</p>

        <p>It’s not FDA approved and it doesn’t even affect the larger portion the population. Unless you have serious medical issues or up in age, it’s not something to be concerned about. Keep this in the back of your mind, the companies supplying the vaccines cannot be held responsible if something happens resulting in a medical condition and/or death. </p>
<p>No harm in asking a question if you’re genuinely curious.</p>

        <p>For me it's simple: I'd rather get Covid (99.8% survival rate, etc.) than use experimental drugs.</p>
<p>My choice. The mixed messages of "unvaccinated transmission rates" cut no ice with me. They've proven that they'll lie unabashedly about any of the statistics. If we've managed to pry a 99.8% survival rate from them, the actual rate is probably closer to 99.99999999999999999%.</p>
<p>If you feel that your best shot at health is the vaccine, more power to you.</p>

When you look at her, it seems to correspond to blood clots going in the brain, but not those that kill you instantly, those that kill you slowly. Wouldn't surprise if there are really a lot of micro blood clots like I ve seen some doctors explain. Invisible on scanners, but detectable to by certain blood tests.</p>

        <p>1) It is NOT a "vaccine". 
Vaccines are made by killing or weakening (attenuation) the organism, and introducing the organism into the body.
The body recognizes a pathogen, develops antibodies, and a "memory" of the pathogen, so the next time it encounters it, it can build antibodies quicker, because it has "blueprints".
This shot is NOT that.</p>
<p>2) It has not been tested.
There are numerous fact checks on that statement that simply use a generic statement from WHO that "vaccines are made under careful conditions and thoroughly tested and monitored". 
THIS shot, however, is not... it has not been tested... it is BEING TESTED. Right Now.
YOU are the test subject, if you get vaccinated.
The trial ends in Dec 2022. (One of the shots is Jan '23). 
After that, they will analyze the data.</p>
<p>3) Censorship, Misinformation and Disinformation.
Too many people have been silenced. Too many provable outright lies have been told to us about this thing. 
The number of dead has been determined to be vastly over reported. People that died from CLEAR other causes. The hospitals were getting paid extra for Covid Patients. If anyone died, regardless of cause, like a traffic Fatality... they stuck a swab up the corpe's nose, ran it through PCR for 40 cycles, and said "SEE, POSITIVE. It's a Covid death". We KNOW this to be fact, not once or twice, but tens of thousands.
Health departments admitting that when questionable cases are removed, the Infection Fatality Rate is around 0.15%... where the FLU is 0.1%.
The Study that said HCQ was dangerous, and lead to suspension of HCQ testing... was retracted from publication.
The study that recommended PCR testing was written by authors that worked for PCR test manufacturers, and sat on the editorial board of the Journal it was published in.
The main stream news outlets have been caught, repeatedly, using misleading or outright fabricated stories. 2 quick examples. 
When Italy was being hard hit, a news report about it was displaying a picture of coffins lined up in an aircraft hanger. A sharp eyed viewer recognized the shot and posted the SCENE FROM A MOVIE that it was taken from.
They said it was an "error". Bullshit. I worked at CBC in the 80s. Edit Suites are NOT CONNECTED to the internet. The only way footage gets in there is to be physically brought in. 
When India was being hard hit, we were shown images of people in the street, with oxygen masks on.  Then we find out from PEOPLE IN INDIA that it's not happening. Turn out, those pictures are from 3 years ago when there was a major GAS LEAK. 
Like "The Boy That Cried Wolf", they have lied to us far to often to ever be believed again.</p>
<p>4) "Don't Question The Science".
If you are not allowed to question the science, IT ISN'T SCIENCE. 
Science, by definition, is open to question. That's what the scientific method IS. 
Science is NEVER "Settled". Real science WELCOMES questions.</p>
<p>5) Othering. 
The MOMENT that any suggestion of a "vaccine passport" or restriction against unvaccinated persons began to be floated, I recognized FASCISM. ...and you can clearly see it in the comments, and posts, right here on Reddit.
People clamoring for this, demanding the unvaccinated be denied social gatherings, denied FOOD, locked away in CAMPS.
Always the most WOKE, too.
First they came for the Communists.
I did not speak up, because I was not a Communist.
Then, they came for the Trade Unionists... and I did not speak out, because I was not a Trade Unionis.
Then they came for the... </p>
<p>6) There is much much more. I can't summarize 10 years of research in a single post.
Look at a video of Alex Jones from 2018. If you just watch it, without considering context... IE, pretend that it still IS 2018, and you never heard of Covid, or any of this.
Watch him talking about plans of the elite to deliberately release a virus and use that to usher in a One World Government.
Out of context, he appears to be a raving lunatic.
But now... everything he said has COME TRUE.</p>
<p>Those who do not study History are doomed to repeat it.
Unfortunately, those that DO study History are doomed to stand helplessly by and WATCH while EVERYONE ELSE repeats it.</p>

<p>All the other vaccines?.. I'm all for them.</p>

        <p>Since the pandemic started, I've not caught the virus and had to travel abroad a few times and have certianly not being isolating/social distancing during this whole thing. The few peope I know who've had it said it was like a cold or flu and the IFR for my age is under 1%. Relative low risk.</p>
<p>The fact the PCR test was being used for diagnostic purposes - even though it isn't suitable for this and there's a high number of false positives.</p>
<p>The huge amount of fear mongering by the media and our own Government. </p>
<p>Additionally, I don't trust the pharmaceutical companies and this distrust has only been increased by the amount of censorship that started during this pandemic. The collusion of Big Tech and Big Pharma is worrying. The supression of information regarding the effectiveness of ivermectin is also a big red flag.</p>
<p>The fact that vaccine passports seemed like part of an agenda right at the beginning - and all these 'crazy conpiracy' theories started to become reality. And now the complete turn around from 'we won't introduce vaccine passports' to that suddenly becoming a reality.</p>
<p>The limiting of personal choice and freedom over what I put in my body. It feels like Governments are using this pandemic in order to have further control over humanity.</p>
<p>But most importantly and this is the hill I'm willing to die on: THERE ARE POTENTIAL RISKS FROM TAKING THE VACCINE, INCLUDING DEATH. Covid isn't dangerous enough for me to take even the smallest risk with a vaccine that I don't need.</p>

        <p>If the risk of the vaccine is X</p>
<p>And the risk of the disease is Y</p>
<p>If X&rt;Y I will not take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Now, X and Y risks don’t have to be catastrophic outcomes or death only.  For me, I assumed a 100% chance of being exposed to covid, and a negative outcome was the chances of a vaccine adverse event or covid serious enough to be hospitalized.  So a healthy 30 year old prob shouldn’t take it, but an overweight 45 year old prob should… while a 75 year old should absolutely take it, while a 12 year old absolutely should not.</p>
<p>However, in the end, my choice is my choice.</p>

        <p>1) I already had covid. I have natural immunity. As much as people want to tell you it “doesn’t last” or “isn’t as good as the vaccine” it is. Here’s some proof:</p>
<p>https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/good-news-mild-covid-19-induces-lasting-antibody-protection/</p>
<p>https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lasting-immunity-found-after-recovery-covid-19</p>
<p>https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2.full.pdf</p>
<p>https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/309762</p>
<p>2) If the virus was as dangerous as they say, everyone not vaccinated would be suffering badly, probably dying. Instead, they have to push people to get vaccinated because people don’t see the virus as a threat (because it isn’t). The virus itself should be the punishment. </p>
<p>3) Trials for the vaccine aren’t even over until 2023 in some cases. How can you tell me you know for a fact that this is 100% safe with no long term effects when we haven’t even had this vaccine out for a year?</p>
<p>4) The push for mRNA makes me extremely uncomfortable. A vaccine of this type has never been this widely distributed or rushed into production. I understand researchers have been working on mRNA vaccines before last year, but that doesn’t negate the fact that certain handling protocols need to be in place (temperature controlled environment for example), and they simply aren’t being tested for quality at the source. Additionally, the only other option (J&amp;J) has been ostracized for cardiovascular issues when Pfizer and Moderna produce similar, if not more serious, side effects. I find the pushback against the only non-mRNA vaccine on the market to be oddly convenient. </p>
<p>All in all, I will not take it. I honestly do not care how difficult that makes my life. I strongly suggest everyone start looking for your local farmers/general stores (maybe family run) and getting to know them now. Create relationships with people on the same side of the fence now. Start practicing your gardening, stock up on seeds and canned goods. And for gods sake, get yourself some protection, the pew pew kind (please learn how to use it). Hopefully this is unnecessary, but we’ve not been wrong yet about the path of government overreach. </p>
<p>Please understand this: if you do your trick like a good little dog and get the vaccine, your owner (the government) will reward you with a treat. Do not bow down because it makes your life more convenient in the long term. Expect the worst out of this situation. Find a way to become self-reliant (money, food, protection, etc.). Then you won’t need to listen to another damn soul on this planet. Freedom comes at a cost. That cost is likely right now to be in the form of speaking out against this madness and losing friends/family/jobs etc. that disagree with you. Find your tribe now. Don’t wait until we have no way of communicating. I fully expect this sub to be banned in the future. You do not want to be left feeling isolated, willing to do anything for some help.</p>

        <p>Covid death rate is insanely low. Vaccines don't stop the spread of disease.  There is no long-term safety data.  These don't make me an anti-vaxxer, just a person trying to use reason.</p>
<p>I would also like to point out that the media is biased in assuming that getting vaccinated is the default, so anyone not vaxxed is abnormal. In reality, no one is born with the vaccine, so the real question should be: <em>why are so many people not hesitant to get the jab?</em></p>

        <p>I have trust issues or common sense depending on how you look at it- the people pushing this are all known liars and if you don't think so, then you haven't been paying attention. 
My gut tells me that they wouldn't be pushing this so hard if it was about health, because they've never given a fuck about my health. </p>
<p>I'm a doomer in my own way because I feel that this is the mark of the beast. I dont want to be on a tracking and control system because that is what this boils down to and the end point ain't pretty.
 I feel like I've known this my entire life and just been in denial about it/partying my consciousness away because I didn't want to look at where this ends, which is all of us in pods attached to a machine. </p>

        <p>I'm a tree surgeon, I ride a scrambler, I shoot, kayak, I'm training to join fire and rescue, and I camp at least once a week if I can. If you were to tally up each one of the risks associated with my lifestyle and add them all up I'm probably one of the most at-risk from death and injury in my entire country. The only way I could potentially be more of a statistical hazard to myself is if I become a deep sea fisherman or join the infantry. Each and every single risk I accept because I am wholly responsible. If I'm injured or die in any single one of my lifestyle choices it's because I fucked up--I wasn't paying attention, I didn't do my checks properly, I forgot to unload and clear, I was going to fast, I accidentally started a fire, I dropped 200lbs of iron on my head, etc., but I fully accept the risks of my chosen lifestyle. </p>
<p>But the risks from the jab are not in my control. I can't decide if I'm going to have a heart attack at 25, I can't decide if it's going to give me a long term condition that prevents me from living my chosen lifestyle, I can't decide if it is going to kill or cripple me. As unlikely as those chances are, they're still not risks I will accept. The median covid death in my country had two pre-existing conditions: I am not prepared to risk getting one of those conditions from a jab I don't even need. </p>
<p>Also the state is being highly aggressive and coercive with endorsing it, and I don't respond to threats. If they want me to get it, they will have to make it worth my while; and being able to go to some shitty Spanish resort or spend a night dancing in a room filled with loud music and drunk people simply aren't enticing enough to accommodate the risks.</p>

        <p>My wife is a dispatcher and her department has had a lot of calls about deaths, strokes, and heart attacks from the vaccine. My neighbor’s aunt was early 40s and in good health and her husband found her dead upstairs a day after receiving her second dose. Two guys that I work with have had all kinds of issues since getting both of their shots. They seem to be sick every other week and are constantly leaving early to go to the doctors office. Lastly, r/CovidVaccinated. A lot of shit is being swept up under the rug.</p>
<p>Is it just me or do some people have an odd look in their eyes after getting vaxxed? Another one of my neighbors looks different in the eyes after getting it.</p>

        <p>Communication on the vaccine has been bunked. We started with media saying not to rush the vaccine or get the Trump vaccine. Now that it’s available and out, the vaccines aren’t as effective as they put them out to be (check out the study figures and look at the ARR) but everyone is jumping on it like it’s the next penicillin. Still operation warp speed. </p>
<p>Also. We’ve been hilariously negligent with covid lockdowns here and still haven’t gotten covid. Went to a pack expo in Florida this weekend. No masks. Full hotel. Still got my sense of smell. And it’s been this way since April.</p>

        <p>I took the vaccine in March and have become slowly more skeptical and regretful of it over time.</p>
<p>I don't think that anyone's trying to do deliberate harm by creating, releasing, and peddling this vaccine. I do think that it is highly likely for a lot of corner-cutting, negligence, and lack of oversight to have happened.</p>
<p>It seems to me that in the span of literally half a year, everyone forgot what shitty, immoral companies these vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer and AstraZeneca are. These companies used to be the most hated companies in the world, largely for their culpability in the opioid crisis, their unethical business practices ranging from coercing homeowners out of their house so they could dump toxic waste to their cahoots with all sorts of decision-making medical boards, associations, and unions. These companies have immense power--power over people's lives--and will do anything in their power to keep the money flowing in. There is no single breath taken under their oversight that isn't making money.</p>
<p>Cue the pandemic. The government is super desperate for a vaccine as companies and organizations around the world start their first round trials. Before the bulk of the development process even begins, world governments have given out billions and billions in contracts to Pfizer et al. for batches of their still experimental vaccines, and they have been given a tight timetable to do it. Not to mention, public opinion is well on the side of these companies already, and people and governments are so desperate for a vaccine that there's hardly any oversight to begin with. Nobody's willing to take the time to double and triple check what's going on, because time is of the essence. So, we have these companies sitting on billions in contracts, with months to make a product, and nobody serious is going to give it scrutiny. This creates the PERFECT environment for corner-cutting and negligence. This is where I think liberals were right last year: this vaccine should have taken much longer to produce. If due diligence was being done here, a coronavirus vaccine should have taken 18-24 months. But it took about 6-8 months instead. Nobody really gave a second look at these vaccines; the press, government, and people took Pfizer et al.'s numbers and ran with them. </p>
<p>Then issues started popping up. At first it was super hard to tell because of the media blackout on the issue, but you could start seeing evidence of people having heart problems, seizures, and even people dying after they took the vaccine. When I got the vaccine, they have you sit in a chair for 15 minutes to see if you develop any symptoms, and they also have you do routine check-ins afterwards with this app that asks you if you're sick or anything. That's a bit concerning, no? I thought we all had confidence in this vaccine and anyone who's saying it can be dangerous was a lunatic! Then I noticed in recent months that my resting heart rate was way higher than it used to be, and should be. I thought at first this was because I haven't been any healthier in the last few months but I'm starting to suspect differently. On the day after the second dose, I got a 103 fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. Luckily it only lasted a day, but I feel like I'm less healthy after having had the vaccine. Then they paused distribution of the AstraZeneca vaccine because of people developing heart issues, and that should have been a red flag at the time for me, but then it got crowded out with "only 6 people died!" and I forgot about it.</p>
<p>This vaccine was not produced to the standards a vaccine should be held to. Everyone was so in need of a vaccine that they forgot to wonder what vaccine they'd end up with. The entire political and social situation created the perfect situation for pharmaceutical companies, who already have a reputation for maximizing profit over well-being, to rush a vaccine using experimental technologies without much oversight. There should have been government, media, and internal scrutiny over every single step of the process, but any calls for such scrutiny got drowned out with mindless rhetoric. These companies knew that they would get FDA emergency approval anyways, so why even bother adhering to such high standards? They can use experimental technology of their own to expedite the process while undermining potential dangers and faults with their product, because they knew that they'd get the money anyways and nobody would care.</p>
<p>Looking at many of the new revelations coming out of this vaccine, including its side effects and the draconian measures that governments are taking to benefit their lobbying buddies Pfizer et al, it's making me sick to my stomach how little people care about what's going into their bodies, how easy people forgot about the companies they're devoting their life and breath to, and how desperately our governments want to undermine and suppress us to benefit their lobbyists. It's pretty sickening, especially considering I was in that camp just a few months ago.</p>

        <p>I did get the shots. My wife and kids did not. My wife and I fought about it a lot. Mid-May they got COVID. It wasn't shit. One day of fevers. </p>
<p>One of the things you're not even allowed to talk about in polite conversations these days are the trade-offs we've made over the past year and a half in the name of safety, but I've come to the conclusion it wasn't worth it. Not even close. My kids mental health is of great concern to me now, I wouldn't even think about it before the pandemic. They basically hate each other from being trapped together all the time.  We might not be the best parents ever, but we're not abusive or neglectful, I can't even imagine what kids with those kind of parents have gone through.</p>
<p>If you remember the Fukishima disaster, when a group of retired elderly engineers banded together to clean up radiation so the young people wouldn't have to sacrifice their future, I feel like we've made the opposite decision. We are giving up our kid's social and educational development as a sacrifice to keep people safe from a virus that kills 1% of the people who catch it.</p>
<p>So since I got the shot, a few things have happened. 1. My family got COVID and I saw how minor it is in kids. 2. It has become clear they've have covered up a lab leak that caused the pandemic. 3. Kids are having heart complications from the vaccine. Every propaganda will have the word "minor" in front of heart inflammation. I've known people who have had heart inflammation, I don't think there's a such thing as a "minor" case. I mean it's only your heart.</p>
<p>I'm proud of my wife for keeping our kids from getting the shot, she was right and after 17 years of being married I should've learned a long time ago to trust her intuition. And to be clear, she is not against any other vaccines and my kids have gotten all their other shots. I have made many apologies since.</p>

        <p>For me it was just basic math. https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/</p>
<p>If you take the worldwide covid cases and deaths then compare them with age,obesity,pre-existing conditions etc. What I end up with is a 0.0023% chance to die from covid.</p>
<p>Unfortunately covid attacks the elderly really badly. Right away from the beginning of covid I found it very odd the news headlines would always report deaths but never tell you the age?? To this day look at thread on the front page about covid.....They wont tell you who is dying from it. They dont want you to know. Their agenda is to whip you into a frenzy.</p>
<p>90% of the deaths are from the elderly 80+ Most of those deaths came from nursing homes as we literally turned them all into covid wards.</p>
<p>I beg you to ask yourself important questions when you receive information.</p>
<p>Who is dying from covid?</p>
<p>Do they have pre-existing conditions? Are they elderly? Obese? diabetes?</p>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/ most normal logical people when looking at this graph would probably feel pretty silly about going crazy over covid.</p>
<p>Furthermore when you take the number of flu deaths from the elderly every year the covid death numbers are even lower.</p>

        <p>I'm not an anti-vaxxer. I went out of my way to voluntarily get vaccinated for MMR, Typhoid, and Meningitis. The risk trade-off was obvious, and the information was clear and honestly published.</p>
<p>Here in the UK, the Government has lied and u-turned on about every centimetre of their policy, and made colossal mistakes. To name just a few examples, they lied about Iraq, and still haven't redressed victims of Gulf War Syndrome. Why would the lying ever stop now?</p>
<p>This is the most rushed vaccine there is in human history, with the AZ vaccine being reliant on an experimental technology. The government pushed for people to take it- only to then halt the rollout for my age category because of adverse reactions *afterwards*. Other countries straight-up banned it. Who's to say that this is the first time? They're looking at doing that to Pfizer now. If you use the same logic that was used to market how dangerous covid was, then from a source *supported by the CDC*, the adverse reaction statistics are dire, especially weighed against age and health categories for whom covid is not dangerous. <a href="https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data">https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data</a></p>
<p>Finally, the UK government has resorted to plain coercion which is indicative of something far more sinister. While I'm not saying it will go as far as the analogy, I am saying that things will become drastically worse if not obstructed permanently and immediately:</p>

I haven't caught a cold or flu (other type of coronavirus) in over a decade due to my heavy intake of vitamin D, and my constant diet of raw garlic and fresh broccoli (allicin in garlic and vitamin C in broccoli work extremely well together in fighting off viruses) so I'm just going with it because I've had no reason to do otherwise. I'll never take another vaccine for any reason.</p>

1) Huge financial incentives for all major players.  <br>
2) Given emergency approval since no existing drug is available - but Ivermectin is a cheap, safe and proven effective alternative (see 1) <br>
3) Recovery rate is &rt; 99% for my age group.  <br>

        <p>If you watch with attention, there's not even need for a pandemic state. The total victims ammount to a fraction of the population (0,03%), the tests are highly unreliable (going positive on anything and the creators of the test already rose up to say they're unreliable, plus many stances of censored specialists saying the same), the numbers are being unequivocally inflated (people don't count each death as a covid death caused by viral pneumonia (what the CDC says is 6% of total deaths), but everyone testing positive in the last 30 days of being alive is counted as a covid death), 90% of the victims are people that were pretty much about to die of something else, all the money being syphoned to cronies under the pretext of "relief funds" that would be way better invested on healthcare service expansions (but that obviously too much work), and the ammount of people wounded and dead because they took a rushed vaccine (even famous people, like Marvin Haggler and Larry King).</p>
<p>I'm not participating in this in any way, shape of form. I will avoid being vaccinated to a disease I don't need vaccination and people that do can treat it with off-the-shelf medicine used to kill lice with more effectiveness than the vaccine itself. For me covid is a doomsday cult and everyone still shilling for it have vested interests in its corrupt exploitation or are sheep, thus deserving to be disregaded.</p>

        <p><strong>I'm healthy.</strong> Initially, I would have considered reading the vaccine data and weighing my comfort levels, but the 100% mindless blitz of "get the jab" "we're in this together" "do it for your community" since the gene therapy (because it's NOT a vaccine, it's gene therapy) came out has put me entirely off it. We've been hit with intense propaganda and people are losing their jobs over not feeling safe taking the gene therapy <strong>over a virus with 99.8% recovery.</strong> </p>
<p>I mean, if you're spidey sense hasn't perked up over the relentless, every single commercial, <br>

        <p>Well first things first here, "vaccine hesitant" is linguistic propaganda. It implies fence sitting in the absence of persuasive information. I'm not "hesitant" about any vaccine. I am refusing this one based on the information I have about it. There is no persuading me to take it, and attempts to do so in light of what I know to be true only make me distrust you further. </p>
<p>With that out of the way, I'm refusing because previous attempts at SARS vaccines led to liver cancer, autoimmunity, and anti body dependent enhancement. There is no evidence that this is different from any other previous attempts at a coronavirus vaccine - in fact, quite the opposite. Further to this, I am distrustful of mRNA tech in general because in 30 years they haven't been able to make one that didn't lead to devastating side effects in both human and animal models, but I'm expected to believe that one they rushed out the door in six months is different? Come on now. </p>
<p>In addition to this, the manufacturers of these "vaccines" have storied criminal histories and zero liability if anything goes wrong with their product. That seems like an enormous risk to absorb to protect me from a virus which, need I remind you, has a 0.02% IFR. </p>
<p>In short, don't want it, don't need it, go fuck yourself.</p>

        <p>The government and big pharma are two of the most corrupt and dishonest institutions in human history. </p>
<p>The fact that they're working together in a multi-trillion dollar deal to push an untested drug with no legal liability just stinks of an agenda. Even if it all works out fine, this is a dangerous precedent to set. Large corporations and their products should not be written into our laws as mandatory obligations that a citizen is forced into. </p>
<p>The media jumping on board to start an aggressive witch hunt against any "anti-vaxxer" only reinforces this bullshit.  The media would never lie to us right? </p>
<p>Frankly, if the media, big pharma, and the government kept telling that I had to take an aspirin, I'd go out of my way not to take it.</p>

        <p>When you read the vaccine industry is a 30 billion dollar a year industry that strives to be a 100 billion dollar industry is somewhat concerning. They want to inject 70 billion dollars more worth of vaccines into you/us. See all the 'booster shots' coming? Someone's paying for that. More money for 'them'.</p>
<p>Also the genetic sequence the vaccines are based off are from China. We trust China now?</p>
<p>I don't need it. I haven't got a flu vaccine either and I've always been pretty healthy.</p>
<p>The government shouldn't be in the 'giving medical advice' field. Also lockdowns...ridiculous. It's more divide and conquer.    </p>
<p>The media is just pure propaganda and not to be trusted. They've been out of the 'news' business for a while.</p>

        <p>Multi-Billion dollar companies do not like bad press which means when there’s bad side effects they are buried and paid off. That alone is reason to mistrust the vaccine even it’s only 2 out of 10,000 the lies and cover ups breed distrust. If they were upfront less people would get the vaccine because the adverse side effects and deaths are more than I think the public would be comfortable with..</p>

<p>Anecdotal experience. I know more people who have got sick from the vax than from covid. I know 1 person my age who got pretty sick for 5 days from covid, most others said it was like a cold. Over half the people I know who got the shot were sick for a day or two. Chills, fever, skin rashes, irregular periods. Some refused the second shot because of how bad they felt. </p>

        <p>Not 'hesitant'. I made up my mind a year ago.
- I had COVID in early 2020 because I had to live in a hotel with lots of international travelers. I've readva lot about viruses and I think having generated antibodies for every part of the virus vs just the single fragment the vaccine instructs your body to create is more akin to 'full spectrum' immunity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's insane to sit there worrying about every single person around you contracting a virus they're 99.9++% likely to survive. We care less about driving our half ton death machines around every day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the government gave a shit about our well being, they'd ban all the additives in our food and mandate living wages or something. Why THIS. The more they push this, the more sussy it looks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't like needles. It better be airborne ebola or rabies before I'm cozying up to a needle. Two needles. Maybe more. Especially one containing an experimental drug.
I'm not willfully going to sit there with an immune response, no matter how 'minor', caused by an injection.</p>

        <p>Everyone in my immediate family (wife and both kids) have had it. Everyone we know who has gotten the vaccine has had a much worse reaction to the vaccine than we did to the disease they're supposed to be vaccinating us against. And some of those people have gotten COVID after being vaccinated. So what's the point?</p>

        <p>There is no convincing evidence (like double blind, controlled clinical trials) that vaccine efficacy is distinguishable from placebo for people who already recovered from covid.</p>
<p>Since I have tested positive for covid antibodies, I am one of those people, so I prefer placebo to vaccine, since vaccine has unpleasant side effects.</p>

        <p>Is it possible COVID in the form it’s been sold to the public from every angle was never something to be concerned about to begin with?  Why must we go back and for about why an untested experimental gene therapy is a good or bad idea when the entire narrative from day one has been entirely fraudulent?  Seems to me that having a debate about whether or not to have someone shoot you up with god knows what is entirely pointless when the entire foundation supporting that debate is rife with fraud and censorship.  Why people are willing to believe any of this is what’s bugging me.  Just because some authority tells you yup it was Covid you’re just supposed to believe them when there’s loads of evidence to the contrary?  It’s not my fault people believe the TV people care about you, or that the govt that robs them at gun point cares about you.  When everything your eyes see contradicts that made up reality such as hospitals that are complete ghost towns for an extended period of time to the point we have nurses doing dance videos in these empty hospitals, while the TV people tell you they’re overrun as if there were an Ebola outbreak in a war zone, should you not be skeptical of the entire narrative which is the basis for this “vaccine” narrative?  Obviously common sense isn’t all that common among Americans or pretty much anyone else.</p>

<p>That and I do not need it. I had Covid back in August of last year, I got over it and honestly if it wasn't for the fact I lost my sense of taste I wouldn't have even known I was sick, but that alone made me get tested. </p>

        <p>I didn't trust vaccines before this. I don't trust the medical establishment, or the government. And if the government and medical establishment had a baby, it would be the Covid vaccine.  The government is acting extra weird about this particular issue. A propaganda campaign like I've never seen in my life, threatening anyone who talks about deaths from it. When a dog food has mold in it and kills a few dogs, the company immediately recalls it (as they should). But every normal way of doing things has completely gone out the window with this. Everything involving Covid has been a lie. It shouldn't have even been considered a pandemic. The PCR tests were designed to deliver as many positives as possible. New hospital procedures were designed to deliver as many deaths as possible.  They are telling people their natural immunity isn't good enough. That's a completely new thing (and a lie). People who are injured and die from the vax are having their social media censored and taken down. Doctors and scientists are being threatened for talking about any possible treatment for Covid that's not the vaccine. Dr Mercola even got threatened for telling people they need vitamin D, which is a well known fact. 
Oh and by the way, someone recently discovered that there are more vaccine effects reporting websites than just VAERS, and they found out that 45,000 people were actually killed in just a few days in the US alone. There are lawsuits being filed over this as I write this. The number of deaths could even be much higher than that since doctors are afraid to report anything bad about the vaccine, or sometimes a connection isn't made if the person doesn't die instantly. If someone dies a few months later, they probably don't even suspect the vax. A doctor tested all his patients with a D Dimer test (to test for blood clots). Results are still pending, but some far, 62% of his vaccinated patients have blood clots, which are likely to grow and cause problems down the road in the near future. Let's see, we also have people having heart attacks, strokes, blood clots (as I already mentioned), neurological damage, hearing and eyesight loss, brain and heart swelling, miscarriages, lumps &amp; tumors on various parts of the body, particularly reproductive organs, kidney failure, leukemia, Guillain-Barre, dementia (new cases or worsening of existing cases), various autoimmune disorders, etc, etc, etc.   </p>
<p>Those are just the physical reasons. The risk benefit analysis should be a no brainer. </p>
<p>I personally also have my own philosophical and spiritual reasons in addition to all this.</p>

        <p>Firstly I don’t need it. Already got Covid and it was nothing. If I get it again, or a new strain, I’m not worried. I’m 30 and healthy. On top of that, there’s not enough data on side effects or long term side effects to put something like that in my body. </p>
<p>The media and gov are pushing this SO hard, pushing how safe it is and everything, yet we’re still seeing negative side effects slip through the crack, which leads me to believe there’s a LOT more negatives being squashed before the public ever gets to hear about it.</p>

        <p>Risk/reward not at all worth it. Reward lowers my chance of hospitalization from 1/10000 (according to university calculators based on my risk factors) to somewhere between 0 and that depending on how effective you think the vaccine is. At best my chance of being hospitalized improves by 0.01%. Even lower for death. Unknown long term effects, legit scientists being censored for questioning, long history of abuse and malpractice from these pharma companies makes me believe risk is much higher than media states. </p>
<p>Near 0 reward, unknown and censored risks. Clearly not worth it</p>

        <p>I did the get the vaccine. I was lucky, other than being tired I had zero side effects, plus I’m tired most of the time so I can’t be certain the vaccine caused or contributed.</p>
<p>However, I know people who aren’t getting the vaccine because they truly cannot do it due to their current and/or past medical conditions. I don’t think this very real scenario is being discussed nearly enough. Everyone who doesn’t get it is considered to be some Trump loving heathen who should have their lives ruined. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t support that period but I REALLY get angry when I hear that my best friend who could seriously die from the vaccine should have her life be made more difficult or whatever that awful Leana Wen recently said. </p>
<p>The way that this has been politicized on all sides is awful. When Trump (who I am no fan of) was in office, the talking point was that we had to be United as a country and how dare he divide. Now, he’s six months gone and the talking point is, ruin lives of those who don’t listen, regardless of the reason. It’s all vile. Every last bit of it.</p>

        <p>Can only speak for myself.  I’m not generally against vaccinations.  Under other circumstances, I may have gotten this one, too.</p>
<p>But I have several comorbid autoimmune conditions, and I react very badly to flu vaccines, which have left me in a near-permanent worsened state.  While this vaccine is not the same type, I simply don’t feel like I can roll the dice with how my body will react to it in the short or long term.  Icing on the cake is how little is understood about it, and how it’s being treated politically.</p>
<p>So, no vaccines for me.  My family members, however, are all vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I did take J&amp;J, because it was based on the Ebola platform. No known COVID, but I've had a couple other unusual illnesses since that I do not normally get.</p>
<p><em>No way in hell</em> will I ever take the super experimental mRNA ones. Who the hell knows what it'll do long term.  </p>
<p>Also the fact that the government said "Just take whatever is available" was deeply offensive to me. I have EVERY right to decide what to put in my body, or whether or not I do so.

        <p>I did some maths for my situation from what I could find from UK gov websites, to see what the benefit vs risk is of me getting the vaccine. This only covers deaths but here it is: </p>
<p>People aged 0-24 make up 30% population UK. 
5.5 million covid cases UK x 30% is 1.65 million cases.
Less than 200 deaths in UK for people aged 0-24, but I’ll round it up to 200 deaths. That is  200 deaths/1.65mil cases. That’s 12.1 deaths per 100,000 cases. 
There have been 1489 reports of suspected adverse side effects where the patient has died shortly after. 46 mil people have had at least one dose in the UK. 
1489/46 mil is 3.2 deaths per 100,000 vaccinations. 
Data for deaths from vaccines according age isn’t available unfortunately.
So as a person under 24 in the UK, I have a 12.1/100,000 chance of dying from covid. For the general population in the UK, you have a 3.2/100,000 chance of dying from vaccine. 
Death rates are inflated and I haven’t spoke about side effects of both covid and vaccines.
But overall, I dont see the benefit of the vaccine significantly out weighing the side effects of the vaccine in my personal case.</p>

        <p>Without getting too much into the weeds, it is a new kind of vaccine, that has been rushed, and has only been approved for emergency use. It has not gone through the proper trials to actually be approved as of yet.   </p>
<p>The fact that the government is all but demanding everyone get this vaccine is extremely strange, considering that some people should certainly not get it based on various health reason. Everyone should consult with their doctor about it first, and not take some politician's or celebrity's word on it.</p>

        <p>I can only speak for myself, but it's simply risk assessment. There's a huge risk with injecting something into your body. You don't know what your reaction might be. If there's a bad reaction, there is no hope of stopping it. You can't take back an injection.</p>

        <p>I'm not hesitant to take it... I'm just not taking it. I'm not at risk, I am very healthy, and I very rarely get sick anyway (haven't been sick in 6 or 7 years). I'm not worried about spreading it because anybody who is at risk has had the opportunity to get the vaccine for months now, so it's their responsibility to protect themselves if they are worried - not mine.</p>
<p>Also, no matter what anybody says, mRNA vaccines are still experimental and not even FDA approved yet. Doesn't mean that an FDA approval would make a difference for me, but the fact that even the FDA hasn't actually fully approved it yet should speak VOLUMES if you know anything about the shit the FDA has approved in the past.</p>

        <p>Alrighty, time to get my ass banned from several dozen subs that discourage sitewide discussion (seriously, I wish reddit would step in about it, but we all know they won't because our "opinion" (discussion) is wrong.</p>
<p>Aside from the censorship of other opinions and reasonable skepticism, the guilt narrative, the emergency push through, the fact that it doesn't actually stop you getting sick, did I mention the "you're a murderer if you don't participate in this highly uncontrolled vaccine trial"...</p>
<p>It's the fact that especially in my country it's being made a prerequisite to getting your basic rights/constitutional rights back is an absolute no go for me. I took the vax, I took the risk, but no one should be punished for not doing so. They shouldn't be ostracized from public life, especially considering that if the vaccines work as intended, the only people they're endangering is themselves.</p>

        <p>I am concerned about the typical vaccines. The media and medical industry are covering it up, but there's just too many anecdotes of children being just fine, getting vaxxed, and then having issues (generally autism/Aspergers). When you look at the ingredients of these vaccines, there are really toxic things in there I don't think should be put in the human body. These include mercury and aluminum among other things. Two of these new rona vaccines mess with your mRNA, an experimental thing that's never been tried on humans before. All four of them give you a nice blank insert so you don't even know what's in them. </p>
<p>My resolve to avoid these things was strengthened by how hard the government and media are pushing them. I consider them to be highly dishonest, immoral scum, so if they're pushing something this hard, it must be something bad. It's also strengthened by having had the rona once, probably twice now, and it barely did anything to me. Another resolve strengthener is hearing a report that the Pfizer vaccine is full of graphene oxide and another report that vaccines damage red blood cells (could lead to internal clots).</p>

        <p>2 reasons. i dont want to. its experimental and i just dont see a need to take it. and with some of the rare reactions that should never happen (people losing control of their body) i dont see a benefit. but more importantly the misinformation pushed to force vaccines and the insistance that i MUST take them raises a read flag. vaccines are required to attend school. BUT you can make up any BS reason and get your kid out of it. and POOF nobody cares. but now they want to have raffles to win prizes and want to treat you like a black gay jew in germany if you dont? something aint right. if the situation was "hey guys. got a vaccine. take it if you like. its a bit experimental but you know perfect is the enemy of good enough. make your own decisions and wash your hands" i most likely would get it within the next year or two. i think we all would right? or wait for a non experimental one.</p>

        <p>Covid doesn’t mutate. Coronavirus does. And every time it mutates it creates less covid-19. Less disease. It is less harmful to the host. That is what happens when viruses mutate. That is why they mutate. They WANT the host to be fine and dandy, because then they can spread more, which is literally their only goal. Not that they care, because they aren’t actually conscious or alive at all really (although that depends which scientist you talk to). </p>
<p>If the virus for some strange reason IS mutating to be more dangerous to the host, then that is likely to be because the hosts in this case got a bit obsessed with trying to play god with genetics. </p>
<p>So, you can’t really say the vaccine hasn’t harmed people. Are you aware of how the virus is mutating in response to the fact that the hosts already have antibodies for their surface proteins upon contraction? No. Neither is anyone. </p>
<p>Genetics is a young field. Anyone who doesn’t want to take this vaccine is aware of that, you obviously are not. If you have about 8 years to spare, you may be able to get a grasp on what all of these geneticists are talking about, what mRNA actually is, how this vaccine actually works and the potential implications of that, and above all, how much we actually really do not know yet. If you stretched out your DNA, all of it, molecule to molecule, it would stretch to the moon and back multiple times. That big thin space line somehow contains information to construct a fully functional human body out of stardust. Do you really think we have studied that in enough detail to start tampering with it? I certainly do not. And that is not a ‘conspiracy’.</p>

        <p>There is no evidence that it stops spread. If this is the case, and the vaccine only protects the person who takes it, there is no reason to force anyone to take it.</p>

        <p>Here are my reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Private health insurance doesn't cover side effects, </li>
<li>Pharma companies have sought and been given protection from legal action for side effects.</li>
<li>Healthy people have died as a result of taking them.</li>
<li>mainstream media is censored, protests are not covered, questions are not answered there is no scrutiny. </li>
<li>I am not at risk from covid therefore why take the risk</li>

        <p>I had covid very early in the pandemic. I felt shit for a day or two and lost my sense of smell for a little longer. In any other year I'd have thought no more of it as it was pretty mild.</p>
<p>I am young and healthy, and hardly ever get ill at all (I have had 1 genuine sick day in 10 years from work). </p>
<p>So I have never been offered a flu vaccine, because I don't need one and flu is statistically more deadly than covid..which I've already had and am fine l, like the vast majority of people. I have had covid so I have some degree of immunity which is exactly what the vaccine seeks to achieve. </p>
<p>Why would I have the vaccine?</p>

        <p>I don’t need to take it. I’m not afraid of the vaccine. I don’t think it’s a plot to sterilize or kill people and I don’t think it’s “dangerous.” </p>
<p>But I’m also not afraid of Covid. I’m a healthy 37 year old man. Covid poses almost no threat to me. I live in a rural area… on a weekly basis, I do things orders of magnitude more dangerous than catching covid. I’m many more times likely to be seriously injured or killed cutting wood than from Covid. It’s not even on my radar as something I am worried about. </p>
<p>I’ve never had a flu shot, either. I’ve had the flu. The flu sucks… but I’m not afraid of catching the flu and I don’t get a flu shot to prevent it. If I get the flu, oh well. The flu is more likely to be more unpleasant for me than Covid. So if I have no fear of catching the flu, I have even less fear of catching covid. </p>
<p>I simply don’t get vaccines for things that don’t pose a threat to my health. And up until now, that was never an issue. I’ve never had any criticism or disdain for not getting a flu shot. The fact that this is such a hot button issue makes me more resolved to not get it. I’m not going to participate in this theater because it makes other people feel better. Your (generally, not you in particular) anxiety or fear or whatever doesn’t entitle you to demand I follow along with what you think I should do. It’s my life and I’ve made a decision… and quite frankly, it’s not even a “big” decision. It means so little to me that picking which pair of socks to wear is more of a conscious decision than deciding not to get the vaccine. Not getting the vaccine is simple inaction. I’ve not done infinitely more things today than I have done… not getting a vaccine is just one of them. </p>
<p>It’s baffling to me to see people my age and younger acting like their hair is on fire over this particular virus. It’s embarrassing and if I comported myself in that way, I’d be ashamed of my behavior in retrospect. If other people want to alter their lives and take precaution upon precaution, they are 100% free to do that. I am not going to indulge your fear, though.</p>

        <p>Why should I get the vaccine?</p>
<p>I am not a high risk if I get the virus.</p>
<p>If the vaccine works, I am zero risk to those who are vaccinated.</p>
<p>I get vaccinated if I believe that the risk of not getting a vaccine is greater than the risk of getting a vaccine.</p>
<p>I do not voluntarily undergo experimental medical procedures or take experimental drugs for things I don't consider high risk. </p>
<p>I am actually very pro-vaccine. You get them to prevent you from getting the disease or virus. But you don't get a malaria vaccine if you are not at risk of malaria. And you do not generally get a flu vaccine if you are healthy and not at risk of you get the flu.</p>
<p>You let your body naturally develop antibodies to make your immune system stronger.</p>
<p>Now, if you ARE at high risk, you get the flu vaccine.</p>

        <p>Three reasons. One, it's an mRNA treatment and not a traditional "dead virus" vaccine. This is the first large scale mRNA treatment ever used in humans and have very little in the way of long-term safety data. Two, I am young (26), active, and healthy. My blood pressure is ever so slightly high and I have a bad shoulder from an old sports injury, but that's it for health problems. Three, I have already had an recovered from covid. In my case, it was nothing more than a very mild cold that I wouldn't have thought anything about if I hadn't completely lost my sense of taste for a week.</p>
<p>Taking all that into account, I've decided that for now it's not worth it for me to take the chance with a treatment that is still in it's trial stages. Maybe I'll reconsider when there is more long-term data available, but for now I will not be getting an injection.</p>

        <p>You want to know the truth? I could write pages and pages of ethical justifications, but I don't have to. I don't owe you that. I don't owe you anything, and none of us do.</p>
<p>Your side's desire to force injections on others is an infringement on basic human freedom. Especially these experimental vaccines which have already had so many side effects and deaths that any other would have been pulled from the market.</p>
<p>A person can say no, and that is enough.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, your side is colluding with business in order to bypass law in to get passports. You think it's great because you want this shot. Do you want the next one? And the one after that? And then the two planned for you in the following year like the Canadian PM has planned?</p>
<p>When you give up your right to say no with this one, you give it up forever.</p>
<p>This has all been politicized. You were tricked. They told you: "Trump supporters don't want the vaccine!" And you guys said, "HAHA! MAKE THEM TAKE IT!" and in doing so you cut off your nose to spite your face.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're giving up our freedom but you're giving up your own, two.</p>
<p>The irony? I said "our" except -- I'm not a Trump supporter, never was. But I'll damn sure never vote Democratic again and the last couple of years have been so embarrassing that I'm ashamed to admit that I ever did.</p>
<p>But unlike your side, I can admit when I'm wrong... And when I voted for Obama &amp; Biden that first time around, boy was I wrong.</p>
<p>The bigger point though is -- this issue shouldn't be politicized, and it is through politicization that you guys were tricked into this entire agenda.</p>

<p>Second my grandpa died from blood clots and guess what the vaccine can do? It can thicken your blood and create blood clots. That shit is even on the cdc website. So no thanks.</p>

        <p>The media is a huge reason why there’s a lack of trust. For many people, the risks outweigh the benefits. Some people think that there’s a conspiracy going on. Some people don’t see the point of getting a vaccine when they’ve spent years suffering from something else that they’ve never healed from. Everyone has their reasons. To some people, the media has lost so much integrity that people won’t take it seriously unless they absolutely have to.</p>

        <p>My doctor, who has earned my trust over the years, has told me to avoid the vaccine. Not because she thinks it's some evil plot to take over the world, but because she doesn't think that I need anymore unpronounceable chemicals in my body. </p>
<p>This"vaccine" is unapproved, unnecessary and undesired. I will not consent to it's administration.  Too many people have died. Too many people are suffering. This "vaccine" is nothing more than a device of torture and control.</p>

        <p>For one i already had covid and the antibodies in my body are far superior to anything a vaccine can do for me. Secondly, the people in the highest office of the land who are currupt and dont care about you are pushing it way too hard making me wonder about the contents of the vaccine. They dont care about your well-being so why would they be pushing this? They could be putting dangerous stuff in the vaccine that labotimizes people, makes them angry and depressed for no reason. What better way to control populations than to euthanize them with "vaccines".  Natural selection is here for a reason. Its the cold harsh truth. The only reason we have such a complex immune system is because of natual selection. Diseases killed people before they could reproduce and pass on their weak genes. The people who survived diseases reproduced and passed on their strong genes which created more and more disease resistant people gradually. We weaken our bloodlines when people with disorders and weak immune systems reproduce. Vaccines are for weak people.</p>

        <p>Love this thread. Seriously can’t believe it hasn’t been taken down. Most of my reasons for refusing the vaccine is the same as all of yours. However, I have one more. When I was 22, I was self conscious and stupid and got breast implants. For years I started feeling worse and worse. After my second child at age 29, my cycles never returned and they said I had autoimmune ovarian failure, basically menopause. After much research, I found out that hundreds of thousands of women had the same exact symptoms. The FDA and doctors refused to acknowledge a correlation. Just in the past year, breast implant illness has been recognized as a medical diagnosis and it’s also been publicized that implants cause lymphoma. So, because of a foreign substance in my body that doctors and the FDA said were safe, I now have multiple autoimmune disorders and am infertile. So, yeah, definitely don’t trust them.               </p>
<p>To add: I’m a nurse. Life is pretty rough right now because we are censored and silenced, called selfish murderers, science deniers, and I’ll probably lose my job soon for refusing if not my license too. It is what it is, I won’t lie to my patients, and I’m not risking worsening my autoimmune issues to take it. No way in hell will my kids get it either.</p>

        <p>Im glad you came on here friend,
- Rraw data released overseas is not looking great for the vaxxed.. the ones USA doesnt like to cover.. like Israel, whom is mostly vaccinated same with England.. most recent data shows its the VACCINATED that is getting infected/spreading, hospitalized and dying from this more so than unvaccinated.. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>standford university released data the actual survival rate of this Covid for majority of people is 99.9% survival rate, basically for anyone below 65yrs old , the percentage of that only goes down if you are older than that + have comorbidities/compromised immune system. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They arent not telling you is what is actually in these vaccines </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>NO scientist can say anything on their efficacy, safety or long term effects..because the data on that is yet to be determined. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-The experiment is literally happening NOW with anyone willing to sacrifice their bodies and families to see what happens. MRna is not a new technology, its been around for a while and worthwhile note is that it has killed any animal its been tested on previously. They happen to skip the animal trials in these particular vaccines because of the “emergency” allowance, which to date is still in effect and yet to be officially approved on any health board, not FDA or eng medical inst etc..</p>
<p>-The average timeframe for a vaccine to be produced is around 10years.. the fastest one ever made prior to this was the mumps which took 4yrs..  now Covid from conception to jabs in your arm was LESS than a year! With trump your current admin was saying ‘dont trust a vaccine that comes out with him, its rushed and unsafe’, literally 3 months later under Biden its now Safe and everyone should take it.</p>
<p>-Heck even the creator of Mrna himself says do not take it its not safe to use. 
The ex vice president of Pfizer who was also their Head scientist of allergy, respiratory inflammation of 40yrs (pro vax) with says it is not safe  do not take. Look it up yourself. Thousands of Nobel Peace winning/ world renown scientists echo the same sentiment. </p>
<ul>
<li>the most peer reviewed scientist in the world says it is treatable but the Govt shuts down any talk of such meds</li>
</ul>
<p>-The Govt want you to hear nothing else apart from their one narrative, by their “scientist” the same people that said  ‘masks are useless, but then masks must be worn.’ And ‘the vaccine will stop the spread but now the vaccinated spread it’ etc.. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Beyond vaccines They are actually infringing on freedom and rights.. with these vax passports they will own you. They dictate your life /freedom “one more booster” or else it expires and you cant buy anything or go anywhere etc. If freedom  comes with a caveat its not freedom at all. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Govt is generally full of it, you see end of day its just about control. When does it end.. just 2 weeks shutdown to “flatten the curve” thats 14months later in CA,still not normal. We just need you to wear masks until theres a vaccines.. a vaccine all we need to bring normalcy and stop infections.. but wait now that vaccines are here it doesnt stop infections and you still need to wear mask annnd keep distance .. your “normalcy” is chasing a carrot.. by how and where they choose to dangle it.. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You might not see it now but this is a pivotal point in history.. you may look back one day and wish things were different but by then its too late. You can however do something now.  If ya interested..

        <p>For me because its not necessary, and it hasn't had long term testing. From the large amount of side effects we are seeing I question is it worth it. </p>
<p>In a few years I may reassess, but at present I don't see it as worth the risk. Its zero benefit to me vs and unknown risk.</p>
<p>I'm not saying there will be a long term risk, I hope there isn't, but we don't know that yet so I'm just going to take my time and see how it all goes.</p>

        <p>In college I ran a Healthcare-focused investment club, and through that became very familiar with the pharmaceutical industry and the FDA approval process. Simply put, the approval process is 3 years minimum and it’s for a reason. Almost every time the FDA has given an exception to the traditional process it resulted in complications and the drug being bumped back to phase 2 or 3 of trials. Add that mRNA vaccines have never been used before, and we truly don’t know what can happen. The majority of side effects can take up to 3 years to take effect, and as a young healthy male genetically predisposed to heart problems so I’d prefer to take my chances with a virus less deadly than the flu rather than an experimental treatment known to cause heart complications in my demographic. </p>
<p>IF I was going to get vaxxed it would absolutely be the JnJ (more traditional) shot from a company with a track record of pharmaceutical success. Moderna was not really a major player until now, and Pfizer is known for very experimental treatments in fields like oncology (cancer) where almost any side effects are worth it.</p>

        <p>For my demo, the risk of covid is so low, specially since my at risk family members are vaxxed by now, that id prefer to risk covid at my 23 years of age  than get a vax that is quite untested and all its bad effects are getting buried by governments and media</p>
<p>Also, i never trust when the media is at the governments bidding and covering a whole section of the governments ass</p>
<p>With all of that, if i really need a job and im getting strongarmed into doing it, id be okay-ish with getting vaxxed, but no mRNA vaccine tho, those ill do anything to avoid for the time being, ill be okay with taking a more old school vaccine... Im not sure which otger ones are like weakened viruses, but the astra zeneca is like that and its the one my parents got</p>

        <p>For me it would be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mRNA vaccine technology is new and unproven, it has never been used on a wide scale before</li>
<li>No long-term trials on this vaccine or even technology before, therefore we don't know its' true effectiveness and safety</li>
<li>There have been serious short-term side effects recorded from the various vaccines, including death</li>
<li>People can still catch the coronavirus and spread it despite being double jabbed</li>
<li>The coronavirus has a higher than 99% survival rate for my age group and likely doesn't pose a serious threat for my long-term health</li>

        <p>I'm at work, and don't have time to read through all 120+ comments already on this thread, so I may be restating what's already been said.</p>
<p>I am not taking the vaccine as it stands because while I find it amazing that one was able to be produced so quickly(credit given where credit is due), it has neither time sufficient for proper testing nor liability for those producing/providing it to the general public. That doesn't inspire confidence in it for me. Add to that the numerous vaccine injuries, and I simply don't trust it.</p>

        <p>There's no way I'm putting something in my body that my liver won't clear out while also not having the ability to sue if there's major repercussions.</p>
<p>Also, the suing aside, I'm a healthy not-overweight 37 year old male. My "group" has a mortality rate so low it could be considered a rounding error. I see the vaccine as an unnecessary risk.</p>

        <p>I’ve assessed my health and decided the risks of getting it out weight the possible benefits. I had Covid when it first started and had no real symptoms outside of a normal cold. I don’t need to introduce my body to an unapproved mRNA injection that I don’t know my bodies reaction to when I already know COVID doesn’t do shit to me.</p>

        <p>-It's only authorized under emergency use, which is revoked if an alternative treatment or therapeutic is available. There is robust evidence that existing drugs are highly effective at preventing covid and moderately effective at treating it, and those drugs were  slandered by the media in order to keep the Emergency Use Authorization for new patent protected vaccines. </p>
<p>-https://www.openvaers.com/ Side effects including death are widespread. </p>
<p>-Covid's risks are extremely low for most of the population, particularly the age groups being targeted for high-pressure sales tactics to get the vaccine. </p>
<p>-The vaccines have a special congressional exemption from liability. You cannot sue them if it cripples you. </p>
<p>-There is no longitudinal safety data on the vaccines. Those trials were not performed. </p>
<p>-The hyper-aggressive censorship and character assassination deployed against anyone who questions vaccines in any way, shape, or form is sufficient evidence all by itself that this is not in your best interest. People who are genuinely offering something helpful do not employ tactics like this.</p>
<p>-It seems pointless when vaccinated people are still wearing masks and still screaming about how they're going to be murdered by variants because other people didn't get the vaccine. What happened to "safe and effective"?</p>

        <p>I was pretty skeptical to begin with...but my Dad, who was already previously exposed to Covid got the Moderna jab. 2 days later he was in the ER for Deep Vein Thrombosis (Blood clot). He almost died, and will now be on blood pressure/heart meds for the rest of his life. On his official records is says its due to 'cold weather'. I've lost all confidence in our healthcare system/government because they sweep this all under the rug.</p>
<p>With Big Pharmas track record, why would I take an experimental drug, for a flu with a 99.8% survival rate?</p>

        <p>I'm hesitant to take any medicine I don't need. I'm not really in a risk group for covid. Heck, based on those blood type studies and the fact that I live in an area with lower population density, I'm not even especially likely to catch it. Also they're made by some of the most evil companies on earth with histories of suppressing negative health-related  issues in their products.</p>

        <p>The death numbers are inflated all around the world. People aren't dying from covid, they are dying of other reasons and if they tested positive in the past 30 days they are counted as a covid death. You have to be tested to be in a hospital. The tests being used, the PCR, have a variable cycle threshold test rate, the higher the cycle rate the less reliable the results and higher likely hood it's a false positive, and the PCR tests can't differentiate between active or inert viral material. The CDC, back in May 2021, changed the testing guidelines for vaxxed or unvaxxed, and as you might guess, the cycle threshold recommended is considerably higher now for the unvaxxed.</p>
<p>The main reason the vaccines were allowed legally to be given the EUA, emergency use authorization from the FDA is that "no known available treatment" existed or currently exists. Ivermectin, among others, is proven effective, and was never once researched officially and all evidence of it working is dismissed and won't be heard by the government or FDA. If they admitted there is an effective treatment the vaccine could not legally have it's EUA.</p>
<p>It's all theatre to drum up fear. People living in fear react and think differently, in a manner to best preserve themselves, not to think critically.</p>
<p>Masks, social distancing, and selective closing of essential and non essential businesses are fear based policy, not based in any actual science. </p>
<p>It's all a game. There is no virus or variants to worry about any more than there is any other year you've been alive.</p>
<p>Look at the massive propaganda campaign to get you to comply</p>

        <p>No legal liability, there are people injured from the vaccine starting to beg for medical help. Whether they are legit or not IDK. <a href="www.vaxlonghaulers.com">vaccine injured </a></p>
<p>Nobody can give you any accurate info as to what’s really in this thing? The cdc and such websites give you a list of ingredients then a few weeks later that list changes. SM 102 was found to be one of the first noted toxic elements (that DOES cause infertility). Now I keep seeing report of graphite oxide an industrial chemical that serves no great purpose other than toxicity. I’m most certainly not keen to injecting anything called “Luciferase” into my body...</p>
<p>In older medical encyclopedias coronaviruses are categorized as common colds. You know the ones they could never find a vaccine for because they are ever changing? Yet now they’ve done it in record time above all other vaccines? </p>
<p>Coercion, bribery, one sided biased media reporting, fishy VAERS activity and so on. The veil has been lifted and people just need to accept that. The 1% only care about us when they can control what we do with our bodies? Not when the world is poor with dying infrastructure and starving with massive amounts of debt? It’s not rocket science.</p>

        <p>Look at news stories from June-September 2020. You will see TONS of articles stating the dangers of rushing a vaccine, with factual references to previous examples in medicine. </p>
<p>Also, I got vaccinated. As I was walking out they gave me a FAQ sheet. What it contained was insane. Pfizer has ZERO liability if I am injured by vaccine. Clinical trials were short term and only 20,000 people who “were given at least one or two shots”. This is nowhere near what a company would need for true FDA approval. </p>
<p>Also, if the vaccines work, the most vulnerable are safe. Why is the narrative to force EVERYONE to get it? There is more at play and you just need to follow the money. Big pharma is laughing all the way to the bank (again).</p>

        <p>My wife and are trying to have more kids. We're in our late 20s/early 30s and until we see data comparing double vaxxed parents (mother and father) getting pregnant and having babies vs historical pre-covid vaccine pregnancy and birth statistics, we're going to wait. I've actually tried to find such comparisons on the CDC website and by googling it and have found nothing. All I get anywhere is "there's no evidence the vaccines cause infertility or miscarriages" but there is no data like I mentioned presented.</p>
<p>I'd say I'm a little different than a lot here and actually recommended the vaccine to my parents who are in their mid 60s. I'm open to it myself and am not scared of dying from it. I feel like I've seen enough evidence that it's safe for me but I'd like to take a more cautious, scientific approach regarding getting pregnant since we only have one shot at it and there's an extremely low risk that we'll severe disease from covid.</p>

        <p>Exactly, so that’s why we wait. We don’t want to be a part of that drug experiment. If I were to be a bit more critical of the situation, I’d even say it’s irresponsible to pressure young people into getting the vaccine without that data analyzed.</p>

        <p>I don’t believe you can inject health. I don’t think you can fight a virus in this way, bacteria is a different thing, I would take the tetanus shot if need, just as example. Vaccine development started in 1800s with Louis Pasteur coining the Germ Theory, I believe he was seriously wrong with how thesis. Hai buddy Bechamp was right in my opinion and he coined the Terrain Theory. Basically, do you vaccinate the fish or you clean the tank. This would be quickest comparison of theories. I’m a strong believer in Terrain Theory. We have exponential cases of neurological issues and more and more vaccines and drugs. I think these two are related. I think it’s obnoxious to think that the development made in the last 100+ years is better for us as species than thousands of years of evolution. Everything today is a quick fix: obesity pill just approved by FDA, instead of tuning into your body and understanding what you need to eat for longevity and yearly. Doctors can’t describe what is a healthy person or do any meaningful mitochondrial tests but we claim we can have a cancer vaccine. Cancer is a modern disease, look up the book called China Study. 40 years of global research by a group of doctors correlating cancer to type of foods on same group of people with the same DNA. Fascinating results. So instead of being g thought how to take care of ourselves, we give birth to babies, vaccinated them, send them to schools at 3 months of age so that we can go back to work and payoff the mortgage. Someone else takes care of our babies, we take obesity pills, vaccinate, thinking this is all the right way to go. The system is broken. I know someone who was injured by DTaP and the process they took to detox the person and give them life back. Had nothing to do with pills and drugs. Lastly, I tend to not follow mainstream especially if I see a strong momentum in one direction like now. The effects of COVID vaccines will be visible in 5-10 years. As in the pay I expect cancer to proliferate and CDC to say it has nothing to do with vaccine. How the fuck did we survive all these millennia without Pfizer I have no idea. This is not a plague today.</p>

        <p>For me personally. These "vaccines" have NOT been properly tested and deemed safe.</p>
<p>But even still.. I don't get the flu one either b/c I just don't feel like there's a reason to get it.</p>
<p>With that being said. I'm not anti-vaxx. Other than the flu shots, and these jabs, my family is up to date on all required vaccinations. I'm anti-being experimented on. Anti-being forced, coerced, shamed, bullied in to doing something with my body that I don't want to do.</p>

        <p>I had COVID asymptotically (I was tested for antibodies as part of a research study in June 2020). Thus, my body likely has an immunological memory to not only the spike protein (which is indirectly delivered to people vaccinated with mRNA technology) but also other antigens from the virus. </p>
<p>Since I had COVID asymptomatically, likely have immunological memory to the virus, and would like to wait to see the long term side effects of this experimental vaccine, I decided to wait until there is more data available on these vaccines. </p>
<p>Plus it is so odd that the “wait and see” people are basically considered conspiracy theorists by the government and media.</p>

        <p>Nobody seems to want to take responsibility for the possible side effects . Short or long term, Moderna has Never made a vaccine. The measures taken for people to get jabbed is highly disproportionate the the danger of covid. There seems to be no open discourse between professionals about the Risk benefit..  Kinda scary so I'll pass thanks</p>

        <p>Well as you already know it is an experimental vaccine. In the USA It has not and will not be approved by the FDA. The only reason we can get it is because it was approved under an emergency, because we had no other “proven” method to fight COVID-19. This is ofc blatantly ignoring the research that other countries had done on ivermectin and other medication like it which has only recently been admitted to being an effective method of fighting Covid that is also cheap and doesn’t have side effects except in super rare cases where someone has a genetic condition.</p>
<p>If someone gets the flu. They have no reason to get the flu shot that year. The same logic applies to the COVID vax and yet, people are still being pushed to get it, even though it has been publicly stated that they will need to get this shot on a regular basis for it to continue to be effective. </p>
<p>My main concern though is why the media is lying about the vaccine? Why did they claim that the vaccine would prevent you from getting and spreading the vaccine when it is now clear, that that was a lie. </p>
<p>The vaccine has a 95% efficacy rating. They advertise this pretty heavily. Most people assume that this means that if you get the vax you have a 95% chance of not getting the virus. This is 100% false. If that was true then that is what they would say, instead of using ambiguous phrases like they have been.</p>
<p>What the phrase actually means is that you have a 95% chance of having less severe Covid symtoms. This is ofc great, if you are at risk of dying if you get Covid or if you just don’t like the feeling of getting sick. However it does not in any way stop you from getting the virus. However there is a high chance that if you do get it, you won’t even know because the vaccine will cover it up. Which unfortunately also means now you can spread it without even knowing you have it. </p>
<p>This is why many people are coming up positive for COVID who have had the vax but yet they feel fine. This ofc also means that the whole “get the vax to protect others” is a flat out lie, and that herd immunity was always impossible with this vaccine.</p>

        <p>Here is are my reasons for not taking the vaccine:</p>
<ol>
<li>The inventor of mRNA as a vaccine (Robert Malone) has spoken out against it</li>
<li>The government is pushing it too hard</li>
<li>YoY deaths have not spiked, even in non mask-mandating countries such as Sweden</li>
<li>Most people dying from this are either elderly, feeble, or in a high-risk group (avg age of covid victim is at or above age expectancy)</li>
<li>Masks don't work (it's right there on the box! Are people blind?), yet they are being pushed - this shows it is not about science</li>
<li>New technology and little testing - which means it is prone to error</li>
<li>Politicians are not following their own lockdown  rules... signs of political theatre are everywhere</li>
<li>Censorship on any dissidence whatsoever</li>
<li>Manufacturers are not liable for any health damages</li>
<li>Serious adverse health effects are happenings and are being dismissed as psychological and non-related.</li>
<li>Promising alternative treatments (ex: MATH+ cocktail) are being dismissed, despite success.</li>
<li>HCQ plants have blown up</li>
<li>This virus came from a lab. It was obvious.  We knew this in April 2020. Yet, our government refuses to acknowledge this.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of our leaders are dumb, others are deceived, and others are evil.  Either way, I don't trust them.</p>
<p>The global elite have been talking about a epidemic for a long time (see Gen. Chi Haotian's 2005 speech, Bill Gates' ted talk ... etc.).</p>

        <p>There has not been ANY studies on long-term effects of the vaccine. Not to mention there has been so many adverse side-effects, especially in very young children. I'm a decently healthy 27 year old woman. I want to have a family soon, and I do not want anything to effect my fertility, nor my fiancé's fertility. And, it just feels like there's too much of a reward system to get it - get a free donut if you get the vaccine, free beers if you've gotten your second shot, here's a lottery ticket for getting the vaccine, oh and here's a free joint too! There are NO other vaccines that have as much incentives for getting it.</p>

<li>Because not a single functional vaccine will make you non immune to the very pathogenic agent that is trying to suspend. </li>
<li>They say that the vaccine will surely protect you, but they're lying about it. The official fact sheets from Moderna say that the vaccine MAY prevent you from COVID. But the handout they give you says it PREVENT COVID. Lie. </li>
<li>The vaccines are in experimental phase that ends in 2023. It says on the label. Why should someone be allowed to experiment on humans before prior animal laboratory tests? That's against human rights. Who knows what changes in your RNA </li>
<li>Even after vaccination you still can't go without mask and you're not 100% immune and can still transmit the virus. But if they introduce biometric COVID passports than you're no longer a threat? Is that a convenient logic?</li>
<li>They do not explicitly mention all the side effects on the handout as you can't see the fact sheet. Even if you see it, most of it is empty. https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/one6u0/informed_consent/</li>
<li>It has numerous side effects and it doesn't outweigh the survivability rate of 99.8%. Yes. My country was one of the three "most critical" ones by percentage per citizen. We had 4000 deaths in 2020 out of 2 million citizens. That's 0.2%. But the numbers they show on the news are: infected/tested and how many from them died. Which of course creates a higher percentage and doesn't represent the death rate accurately. </li>
<li>Makes no sense to have the shot if you're a perfectly healthy person. I myself do frequent health checks and take care of my body the best way I can. Why would I need someone to inject COVID into my system? I am going years without any flu or major health issue. And I am not alone on that. </li>
<li>Nobody is responsible for any side effects caused by it since you comply/agree that everything's on your own risk. Not convenient for me. </li>
<li>They want to forcefully inject us by limiting our basic human freedom and rights.  </li>
</ul>
<p>And I can go on and on with this. There's more on this link if you don't mind spending time to facts from the opposite side. https://factcheckedorg.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/covid-vaccines.r5.1.pdf</p>

        <p>My concern is that this vaccine uses a novel mechanism not used in other vaccines before, and the testing involved is orders of magnitude less than other vaccines.  </p>
<p>Your DTAP, Polio, vaccines have been around for decades, with hundreds of millions, if not billions of doses given out. Their mechanism of action is well understood, and the number of doses guarantees that any 'long tail' side effects will have been noted and addressed.  I have also never known anyone personally who has had a negative reaction to a 'normal' vaccine (this is obviously anecdotal).  With the COVID shot, there has been less than a year of testing, on a vaccine with a new mechanism, and I have personally known 3 people who had to have their teenage children hospitalized after getting the vaccine.  Again, while anecdotal, that fact seems to indicate that the number of negative reactions is probably substantial.  When my wife got the vaccine, she got significantly sicker than when she actually had COVID. </p>
<p>The other thing, I had covid already last fall.  I get my antibody levels tested regularly when I give blood, and they are still at levels that should make me immune. To claim that natural immunity is somehow inferior to the immunity granted by the vaccine is anti-scientific. The argument is 'we just don't know how long natural immunity will last', but somehow we do know that a vaccine will work better with less than a year of testing?  Bullshit.</p>
<p>The final thing is the level of propaganda and censorship going on.  If I want to read about side effects of the tetanus vaccine, I can google it, and probably get good balanced information.  With COVID, I can't do that. All I will be able to see is carefully curated information that Google, Facebook, and White House have decided I'm allowed to see. It is wholly unreasonable to expect an adult to just accept the 'word' of a tech company when deciding how to balance the risks and benefits of a medical procedure.</p>

        <p>I have a few reasons.</p>
<p>1.) I have a history of having bad reactions to vaccines and getting sick after getting them. Not sure if allergic or what.
2.) I feel that these injections were rushed with no data on long term adverse effects.
3.) I feel that the way anyone who says anything negative about it gets discredited and in the cases of scientists/doctors, their reputation got tarnished, and I feel like they are putting in too much effort to tarnish them. If it was really wrong, they’ed damage their own reputation</p>

        <p>Because treatments like HCQ &amp; ivermectin, that cost pennies where lied about and hidden from the public.  The only reason the FDA issued the temporary authorization for the experimental vax is because there is no other treatments available - which is false.</p>
<p>What is so important about this vax, why are they pushing it so hard?  Why the marketing campaigns on tv and censorship on social media.  Is it just money?  Is it something more?  We don't know the short term or long term affects of a gene therapy that has never been tested on humans.  If they truly were concerned about the wellbeing of society, then why did they suppress the existing (cheap!) medications that have been widely used and widely harmless?</p>
<p>For me personally, I am not worried about CV.  I live in a rural / blue collar area, no one follows mask guidelines or social distancing and I have not caught it.  The people that have, said it was mild.  I think the entire thing is completely overblown.  So I have no desire or intention of taking an experimental treatment for a virus I am not afraid of.  I don't trust the media, I don't trust big pharma, and I certainly don't trust the people pushing the jab the hardest.  I will take my chances with a virus I have a 99.95% chance of surviving, and if I do catch it, I will use HCQ &amp; zinc (yes, I have a prescription).</p>

        <p>I'm not scared of the vaccine per se, if I have to take it I will, but I believe covid is just any other respiratory illness with a new scary name to create dramatic change, and not for the better. So at this moment in time I won't take the vaccine on principle. Luckily I have no incentive to do so in terms of priveleges.</p>

        <p>I think the pertinent question is, why do people <em>want</em> to take the vaccine? </p>
<p>Because they're afraid of covid and think the risk/benefit analysis favors obtaining vaccine-induced immunity to covid, right?</p>
<p>Well, I'm not afraid of covid and I'm aware that the vaccine carries risks which frankly concern me more than covid does. I could elaborate and I could throw in some philosophical reasons as well, but that's enough. </p>
<p>The bottom line is that I don't have a reason for wanting to take the vaccine. If I'm going to subject myself to a non-risk-free medical treatment it needs to be worth it. This vaccine isn't worth it.</p>

Because there is a proven track record of all the underhanded and corrupt actions big pharma has participated in over the years. Because I react terribly to anything stronger than Advil. My entire medical file since I was a teenager is me saying I don't want any meds. Not birth control, not anti depressants, not opiates. I had emergency back surgery and only took OTC meds for recovery, and the 800mg Tylenol. And because. I don't want it. Full stop. This is my body. I decide what goes in and what I do with it.</p>

        <p>Lots of reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dr Malone, the INENTOR of the mRNA vaccine is being silenced right now. He is also raising some concern regarding the vaccines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the purpose of the vaccine is to end the pandemic, then we should throw everything at it, including HCQ and Ivermectin. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many doctors who are speaking out against the vaccine, lock downs, and why is it that only doctors who tow the Fauci lines are promoted as true? Remember, everyone once KNEW the earth was in the CENTER until one guy contradicts it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VAERS website is reporting about 10,000 death so far. How many people didn't report? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't touch anything! Wipe down everything! BUT when we test if you have it or not, we are going to shove this thing right up your nose to touch your brain. It is the only way to test it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The absolute brand new way they invent infectious decease. If you are vaccinated, you can still get it from unvaccinated plebs because they are dirty, dirty unwashed swine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is alarming how hard some country is pushing lockdowns and vaccination because of something that has a 99.something % survivability rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And this last one, we did that Nuremberg thing a while back, and we are repeating it all over again. So no, fuck 'em.</p>
</li>

        <p>The danger of COVID has been hysterically inflated from the start. Nobody seems to mention that the majority of deaths occur in the elderly. Hate to say it but that’s what old people do: they die. They can simply fall the wrong way and die. So in recognizing these facts, it becomes strange that a vaccine appears out of the blue, completely free also. The government doesn’t give a shit that the same amount of people if not more die from heart disease or cancer every year. But all of a sudden we’re being offered a free experimental vaccine? I’ll pass.</p>

        <p>If nobody has said it already, JnJ, Pfizer, and the other big pharma companies have paid out ‘billions’ in fines for manipulating research and lying to/bribing doctors to claim their drugs are safer than they are. Given that they stand to make untold billions of dollars selling this vaccine, combined with their being COMPLETELY IMMUNE from any liability for injuries caused by said vaccine, why would ANYONE actually believe them. They have all repeatedly proven that they place their profit margin above the health and lives of people, and they are now immune to any repercussions. What reason does anyone have to trust anything they say?</p>

        <p>A few things. I'm at a very low risk of complications from covid. The vaccine is new and may be dangerous, bad reactions are being censored and not reported on. I don't trust the government because they have been wrong about everything so far (either on purpose or incompetence, you decide). Its a disease so bad it needs its own marketing department.</p>
<p>Im not anti vax and have all my other vaccines. I don't care if other people get the vaccine. I just want to be left alone. If I die, I die, and it'll be on me. I'm not responsible for anyone's health but my own and my son's.</p>
<p>And for the record, covid is a nasty virus that you don't want to get. It can be very dangerous but isn't always.</p>

        <p>The media only shows one side because:  <br>
In Canada, the media accepts money from the government.  They lost their objectivity when they started doing that.  The media only publishes whatever the government tells them to publish (things that fit the narrative)  <br>
In the USA, 90% of the media is owned or controlled by a small number of people who hate America.  They publish only things that benefit their side.  </p>
<p>Those of us who look objectively at al sides of an argument and make up our own minds see how the mainstream media is pushing something and they have shouted down or suppressed counter voices.  It makes me nervous so I chose to wait and see if the vaccine is dangerous or not based on observable evidence (high or low death rate from the vaccine over time)</p>

<li>I'm at risk for blood clots due to my medication.</li>
<li>There aren't any longitudinal studies done on the safety of the vaccine. I have seen what they called "longitudinal" studies but at most it was three months.</li>
<li>If I have any reaction to the vaccine, I can't sue anyone or get any kind of compensation.</li>
<li>Me and my family already caught Covid and have antibodies which DOES protect us. Just like the vaccine, we just don't know for how long. </li>
<li>I know a lot of people that had worrying side effects that were dismissed by their doctors. People shit on anecdotal evidence but anecdotal evidence can lead to the formation of hypotheses which can then lead to new discoveries. This isn't being allowed since not all side effects are being officially documented.</li>
<li>The vaccine is more of a risk than the virus in my case.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, I do believe the vaccine works. I just don't think it's safe.</p>

        <p>With the emerging mutations we are already seeing the virus getting around the vaccine. By the time it’s fda approved it will be rendered useless. Also while the use of MRNA technology in vaccines will be potentially revolutionary for the field of immunology there’s still a lot of research that needs to be done to prove it’s safe long term.</p>

        <p>Well I already have it although I didn’t want it (parents), but I will answer on my thoughts if I had control over getting it. I am healthy and a teen so I am low risk to COVID. I would also want to wait a couple/few years to see the long term FDA studies on it. Plus the small chance of deadly side effects doesn’t help.</p>

        <p>I’ll start by saying I’m not an anti vaxxer. I’m not even really anti covid vaccine. If it makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside go ahead and get it. I think I already had covid (never got tested because I refuse to be part of their statistics) and it just wasn’t that bad. I have numerous friends that have tested positive for it. They all say they have had worse hangovers. 
I really just don’t think it’s that big of a deal unless you have underlying health issues. Just like the flu isn’t that big of a deal unless you have underlying health issues. In general, I don’t visit the doctor unless I’m bleeding and I can’t stop it, or there are bones sticking out. 
I don’t take the time to get the flu shot, I’m not going to seek out the covid shot either. </p>
<p>Now on to the political part. Political party affiliation aside, any time a government agency tries this hard for this long to get me to do something that is supposed to be voluntary I’m immediately suspicious of ulterior motives and my answer is going to be “fuck you, no!”
If they make it mandatory, or try saying you can’t travel or do anything without a vaxx passport my answer is still going to be “fuck you, no!” Except at that point I’ll be planning my strategy for the revolution. 
Creepy uncle Joe is a dementia ridden bumbling old fool with no clue what he’s doing and luckily our governor and state attorney general both realize that Biden is an old fool and have made it clear that none of his bullshit, from gun control all the way to covid mandates, will not be welcome in our state.</p>

        <p>I have the Covid antibodies. I was tested twice for antibodies and both times they were present. I never had a single symptom of Covid. My body took care of it naturally therefore I don’t want the vaccine. I also don’t trust it because of how hard they are pushing it. In terms of herd immunity— we should be there by now. I think the vax should be for the most vulnerable people… Definitely not kids who barely even have symptoms and are not dying of Covid.</p>

        <p>The mantra “safe and effective” is a major red flag. The use of subjective words in the so called scientific community is absurd. The truth is we don’t know much about the short or long term effects of the vaccine 💉</p>

        <p>I just don’t need it.  I’ve gone this entire pandemic working, eating out, exercising, and living life normally.  I’m under 30 years old.  Never smoked in my life and am considered very fit/healthy.  I don’t get any flu vaccines ever, and haven’t had more than a stuffy nose since I was a child.  It’s just unnecessary.  I think if this was something that was incurable and had a strong chance of fatality FOR ME, I probably would.  I don’t feel threatened and see no need to get it.  Everyone else who feels differently can get it. Makes no difference to me.  I only care that people don’t ask about this anymore</p>

        <p>I already have heart issues that are possible side effects from the vaccine. I will not do anything to potentially make it worse. Granted some people will argue that the virus itself can cause those same issues but my immediate relatives have had covid and recovered with no issues so I’ll take my chances .</p>

        <p>I fear for the extreme side effects. 
I’ve got diabetes and have had a heart attack. 
I fear for my loss to my family of me from taking a very experimental drug that was the same time as the virus. There is no long term studies of the side effects. Your grandparents the MSM so cherished for the argument wont be around for the long term stuff. </p>
<p>This is all similar to resident evil the movie. There is a virus and vaccine created at the same time. </p>
<p>Release the virus. Thin the herd. Release the vaccine too soon it’s shady. Release it too late you have a very thin society to control. </p>

<p>I put it also to the last scene with the trinity of avengers vs thanos. His speech falls into this. </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/XpeOIww_l4A</p>
<p>Yes. These are fictional, human written scenarios. 
But we also ground ourselves in fiction and non fiction writing to put ourselves on a path. </p>
<p>But it is odd there are similarities taken from these that are once conspiracies but become truth after too many people dig around. One person digs they die from suicide of two bullets to the back of the head.</p>

        <p>I’m not concerned about the health effects. I went on a vaccine blitz a few years ago and got a couple just because. I hardly ever get flu shots.</p>
<p>Countries went into lockdown for a vaccine. Fauci pushed for a vaccine after what happened in New York. Australia still is forcing the vaccinated to do hotel quarantine and in the future may permit them to self quarantine at home. Those who are vaccinated have the same restrictions as the rest. We went into lockdown until a vaccine and it’s not a silver bullet that will end restrictions.</p>

        <p>Hesitant? Lol </p>
<p>It’s not about hesitation, it’s about true medical research. It’s about learning that there are drugs such as HCQ or ivermectin that destroy covid. It’s about it not being approved by FDA, it’s being allowed under the emergency authorization act which is only allowed to be used when there are no other treatments or cures. </p>

        <p>Because I don’t trust the government and I’m highly suspicious of the authoritarian turns  happening across the world. My worst fear is finding out 10 years later that I have a condition which can’t be explained and the media telling us it was an oopsie and it was done with the best intentions because we were experiencing a deadly pandemic. Honestly if I took the vaccine that would be in the back of my mind everyday and I don’t want to feel terrified because of a decision I was coerced into taking.</p>

        <p>At this point, most people know at least one person who has had a severe adverse reaction to the vaccine and when you weigh the risk of that versus covid (which many have already had and it was no big deal) the risk-to-benefit ratio just doesn’t pan out.  </p>
<p>I personally know people who have had miscarriages, myocarditis, pericarditis, heart attack, can’t seem to get pregnant, severe brain fog, anxiety attacks, and 1 even died. I have even seen the magnet trick done on some of their arms. </p>
<p>I think the better question is, why WOULD I get the vaccine? </p>
<p>I am healthy, have natural immunity, and am at very little risk. (I don’t even eat GMO food, I’m certainly not going to inject it into my body!) Most people would say to protect others, but the vaccine doesn’t stop transmission so that’s a pointless argument.</p>

        <p>Because I’m a firm believer that you don’t need to fix what isn’t broken. </p>
<p>I was travelling in India when the pandemic started and since then I have been to multiple developing countries, in slums and markets, crowded buses and trains. I even boarded a plane full of hospital patients being repatriated. The pandemic didn’t exist amongst the poor of the world, but instead the lockdowns were what caused them immense suffering. </p>
<p>All the measures they face are a direct result of the incompetent rules made in the west. And now they tell us to get the shots in order for things to return to normal? </p>
<p>There is no going back to normal for countless people. And it certainly won’t happen because of these shots.</p>

        <p>me personally along with all the obvious reasons of untested, side effects, long term effects, etc. is because I dont need it and Im not going to put something especially untested into my body that i dont need. Im 38 years old, never had a flu shot, never had a flu, havent been to the doctor in over 20 years and that was because of a sports related injury. I very nearly never get sick and when i do I simply stay home for a day or so and let it pass. I worked nearly every day during the "pandemic" in a retail environment and never got sick and if I did catch covid it passed through unnoticed because Ive never been tested, so I ask why should I risk it .01% chance Ill catch it unknown percent chance I'll have an adverse affect of an unknown and unneeded vaccine so why take the chance?</p>

        <p>This question was a success, with lots of great answers. We should pin this thread!</p>
<p>I see a lot of people highlight the medical details about the vaccines, risk/reward trade-offs and safety. To me, these are mostly irrelevant, since I will not take it. My reasons are mostly political.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ul>
<li>Me and my closest family are healthy and don't need it. Furthermore, I'm almost certain we already were infected and recovered.</li>
<li>Our parents already got vaccinated or recovered from covid.</li>
<li>I owe those who instigated, enforced or cheered on the lockdowns nothing.</li>
<li>Nobody considered my health requirements or well being over the last year. Why should I care about other's now?</li>
<li>The vaccine passport and other attempts at coercion is good enough reason to resist it outright. The medical apartheid is unacceptable.</li>
<li>The censorship, lockdowns, travel restrictions, mask-mandates, and vaccines breach basic human rights, constitutional rights and the Nuremberg code. I do not under any circumstance consent, encourage and support them.</li>
<li>The masks and the vaccines are no longer about health. Instead it's a symbol of support for the tyranny.</li>
<li>I've had no say in the matter as the free world, Europe in particular, has turned into totalitarian dictatorships. I'm taking this chance to vote NO, by not taking the vaccine.</li>

        <p>Because I’m not at risk enough to take it right now. Don’t need it now and likely won’t need it anytime soon.</p>
<p>Also, far too many red flags surrounding COVID and the vaccine in general. Why is the government acting like a business?</p>
<p>I’m still restricted to the same confinement’s with and without the vaccine. Why would I not be skeptical of its efficiency?</p>

        <p>Look what's happening with the fully-vaccinated in Israel and U.K.   The vaccines aren't as effective as we've been led to believe.  The virus mutates to get past the immune system as after vaccine one you don't have enough antibodies to kill it. Don't be their human guinea pig. and Listen to Geert Vanden Bosche on YouTube and shut off MSM.</p>

        <p>For me. I was an essential employee, working at a place with zero social distancing and cheap Chinese made masks, I would say the chance of me gotten covid at least 2 times is very high.  I am still fine and extremely healthy, if you actually read the data out there. You would see that if you have gotten covid and are young, then there is zero need for a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I'm 28 and decently healthy. I see no reason to take something that is guaranteed bad for me to avoid something that MIGHT BE BAD FOR ME. </p>
<p>It started with the idea that I didn't want ANY side effects. I wasn't sick then, and if I took it, my only guarantee was that I was gonna get sick instead of not due to the body adapting to the vaccine. </p>
<p>Then I read about the RNA and I was pulled over. Not doing it. Not risking:</p>
<p>Possibly:</p>
<ul>
<li>month long tremors</li>
<li>paralysis</li>
<li>ALS</li>
<li>possible lifelong dificiencies</li>
<li>early death (within 5 years of taking it)</li>
<li>infertility, IF I DECIDE TO HAVE KIDS</li>
<li>god knows what else considering I've heard scientists say RNA has never been used this way and they have NO IDEA how it will affect your body. </li>
</ul>
<p>It's my own risk, and I accept that.</p>

        <p>so many reasons why i’m refusing (not hesitant) to take the vaccine. mainly, i’m young, healthy, and not scared of catching covid. i didn’t lock myself in my house for 6 months having my groceries delivered. i’ve worked with the public and have been living my life just the same during the pandemic as before. no masks unless required by a store, domestic airplane travel, going to bars, parties, etc. (including passing a liquor bottle around and drinking off it). never had covid that i know of, i guess i trust that my immune system is strong and able to fight off a cold/flu. worst case, i get sick. it happens. 🤷‍♀️</p>
<p>the vaccines only “benefit” is that if you catch covid, supposedly it isn’t going to hit you as hard. it doesn’t prevent you from getting covid, spreading covid, etc. covid wasn’t going to kill me to begin with, so why take the vaccine? if this was a virus that was taking people out left and right, had a high chance of death if you contract it, then yes, i would take an experimental vaccine. in like feb when i saw those videos of people collapsing in the streets in china, i was legitimately concerned, ready to quit my job,and seriously quarantine in my house. i was the first person at my job to wear N95 masks. simply because, i had no idea what we were dealing with. well as time went on i realized that this whole thing was being blown out of proportion and while everyone was starting to get hysterical about covid, i didn’t give af anymore. </p>
<p>i’m genuinely more scared of the vaccine than i am of getting covid. no, i don’t think bill gates is implanting 5G microchips through the vaccine. maybe a small fringe group of crazies actually believes this, but the media/left/covid cult run with it to make anyone who is hesitant of the vaccine look like conspiracy theorist fools, while ignoring the majority of our actual, reasonable concerns. </p>
<p>experimental mrna vaccine, no long term studies of side effects (obviously bc it’s brand new), there is data of more immediate side effects (effecting young people’s hearts, women’s periods, etc). i think the most sus thing to me is how the government is pushing it SO HARD. it’s creepy. biden wanting to go door to door, paying celebrities to pander to people of different races/groups to “just get the jab” (also hate that term), having vaccine lotteries/giveaways (a good way to get desperate poor people vaccinated), etc. when in history has the government/big pharma had the people’s best interest in their hearts out of genuine concern? lol, never. remember when the left used to be distrustful of the government and big pharma? same. trust and believe pfizer and co is making money hand over fist for this vaccine, and they have every $motive to make vaccines mandatory in every setting, and to keep putting out booster shots. </p>
<p>the fact that the covid cult constantly says “trust the science! listen to the doctors/scientists who have studied this for years not just a fb meme your aunt shared!” but the second a physician or scientist expresses even the slightest concern about the vaccine, or anything that goes against the narrative, they are silenced, called quacks, called conspiracy theorists, are accused of spreading misinformation, fired from their jobs, etc. sorry, but that doesn’t sit right with me at all, that there can be no differing opinions voiced in the science community. when has that ever been the case? you either support the vac 100% or you’re a stupid trump loving conspiracy theorist lol. </p>
<p>i don’t care to convince anyone to not get the vaccine. i don’t care what other people do. these are my personal reasons, and i wish people would respect my choice to not take the vaccination like i respect their choice to get it. my body, my choice.</p>

        <p>Most importantly why is one being persecuted when they do not want it? People have different levels of discernment but once you do you can I see it.  The lack of trust in a system that does not have the best interest for humans is enough for me.. I researched the document from a meeting the FDA supposedly had about Covid, on one page a list of the adverse reactions how come they don't speak on it on main stream media?  Complete disclosure is the problem with those in positions of power, along with corruption and greed .</p>

        <p>Frankly the government, media, pharmaceutical companies have eroded my trust so much so that I could never feel okay adhering to their propaganda.</p>
<p>This whole virus narrative is fishy and very much follows the patters of other fear campaigns desinged to erode civil liberties a la the red scare, the drug wars, and the response to 9/11.</p>
<p>And to boot Ive done enough research in the vaccine from the websites of the companies thst made them, that this science has the potential for chemical warfare</p>

        <p>When I heard the companies developing them had been absolved of liability for any potential damages, that was enough for me. I mean, nobody in their right mind would buy a car under those circumstances, or anything else for that matter! </p>
<p>Then you start to look into it a little further and you find out how short the development process was compared to anything that would be regarded as normal (go-go Trump LIGHTSPEED!), how the inventor of the MRNA vaccine methodology was expressing his grave concerns about the longterm effects (and how this was subsequently largely ignored), how incredibly low the death rate is (and how it seems to be higher after taking the treatment), how dramatically the ill effects recorded in the US VAERS system rose... It just goes on and on.</p>
<p>Aside from that, it just didn't make any sense that something closer to gene therapy than an actual traditional vaccine would be needed to protect other people from viral particles that I might be shedding, even if they'd already had it themselves. What good is it doing at that point? With all the myriad ways that something so new could go wrong vs the typical symptoms associated with the virus, the cost benefit analysis just doesn't add up.</p>
<p>My partner has already had two doses, and as we've seen from the story in Germany (changing the law to revoke your human right to bodily autonomy in this specific medical context), not taking the shot isn't even safe anymore. We're going to get infected by either the virus, or spike protein emissions from those who have opted to take the shot regardless. It's a scary time to be alive and I just hope we can all make it out the other side with something like human civility intact, and that we can find a way to remove the people who believe in sacrificing liberty for "security" from power without any bloodshed.</p>

Moreover, why do you think your safety is more important than my safety if I believe the vaccine could be dangerous? I’m vaccinated, and i full support everyone else’s decision to not get vaccinated.

        <p>I am vaxxed and I am not liking the ways things are unfolding in this “emergency”. I am still inclined to believe very soon we will hear about the official inefficiency of the current vaccines with the delta or a derived subvariant, and we will all be back to the crap and BS we had in March 2020. This is smelling like the real start of a new world order where our freedoms we knew will be only a memory and we will be living in a communist-style way, where we will be enjoying intermittent periods of the old normal but with masks and then face other periods of forced lockdowns. The governments, companies and entities in general are advocating for an at-home lifestyle. There seems to be an inclination to make us want to stay as much at home as possible, and it is working- and even more scary that it is a worldwide phenomenon.</p>

        <p>I’ve had a health condition (had some cancer removed and still being monitored) for the past 2 years that is being dealt with and I do not trust these shots to not screw it up for me. I also feel very sketched out about the fact that we have no long term studies on the effects, that people are being coerced and enticed to take them, and that they set a terrible precedent in terms of bodily autonomy and what the state is allowed to dictate or enforce if they link it to a pass system. It just seems like a shit idea all around. You can still get and transmit the illness, too. It is mind boggling.</p>

        <p>For any action, the neutral position is "no." I need to have a reason to do something in order to do it. E.g. I'm not just going to get up and walk to the kitchen out of the blue, I have to have a reason, like wanting to get a glass of water.</p>
<p>That reason must also be significant enough to overcome the cost of doing it (in this case, just time).</p>
<p>At this point, most people in the world, myself included, are filtered out. Setting aside the issue of social pressure, there's just no reason to get it. If you already had it, you gain no benefit. If you're not at risk, you gain no significant benefit. Accordingly, the default "no" wins.</p>
<p>This is all without digging into the negative reasons. Once you've looked at whether you have enough of a positive reason to take an action, you then look at the negative reasons to not take the action. This is where you find risk of getting sick, risk of side effects, risk of long term effects, etc. We don't know those and they are often personal, so that's a hard call.</p>
<p>There is one extremely strong negative reason that is worth mentioning. The combination of strong pressure and extreme dishonesty coming from the proponents are massive red flags. Even if I had a reason to take it (e.g. vulnerable/elderly), these red flags would cause me to stop and wait. Heck, my State just rolled out a $50,000 lottery to take it. While we may not yet know the <em>what</em>, the<em>why</em>m or the motives behind it, it's obvious that there's something fishy going on.</p>

        <p>I don’t see a need too. I’m young, healthy, have never had Covid even though by now according to cdc standards I should have had it!! And bc I don’t really trust it. I don’t trust it bc the media is pushing it so hard, even offering incentives to those who get it and it’s a little weird. Why isn’t the CDC telling ppl to get healthy and better their immune systems? Why don’t they care that they feed us poison and our healthcare systems suck?? But all the sudden there worries about us getting Covid, a virus with a 99.7% survival rate. Seems fishy so for now I’m going to opt out</p>

        <p>The whole thing is stupid.</p>
<p>It isn't a vaccine, per the FDA it is an experimental gene therapy. </p>
<p>No widespread mRNA treatment has ever before been successfully approved, and no coronavirus vaccine has ever worked before.  All for good reasons that tend to show up in long term testing, which wasnt done.  So why all of a sudden does this doubly risky one totally work? </p>
<p>Even if it doesnt have unknown long term side effects, the shot provides limited benefit at what appears.very high rate of side effects in healthy people not at risk from corona virus.  Multiple meta studies have shown upwards of 200x more risk from the shot than from the virus depending on age.  So we would be better off with a giant corona party and just make sure everyone gets it.  </p>
<p>The whole coronavirus crisis could have been managed by protecting at-risk populations and letting everyone else get on with their life.  The fact that politicians chose the worst, least effective and most injurious approach leads me to believe that this is a crisis that couldn't be left to waste. </p>
<p>And finally no one is capable of talking rationally about it.  Just using the term anti-vaxxer for people who are unwilling to participate in an experiment and who arent at risk shows the lack of reasonable dialogue currently.  All of the people who got the dengue fever vaccine should be a lesson.  If the worst amoral and abhorrent people  - celebrities, sports people, politicians, and shadowy billionaires are so desparate for me to get it, but cant explain why without lying about the severity of covid and the risks associated, then I want no part.  I cant image the cabal of want-to-be overlords investing so much into a propaganda war to force me to get an experimental injection really have my best interests at heart.</p>

        <p>Because health doesn’t come from a needle. Because it’s still in trials and I’m not a lab rat. Because trials of other mRNA vaccines didn’t end well for the lab “rats”. Because I have an immune system. Because I’m not afraid of a virus with a 99% recovery rate. Because the only “pandemic” is media propaganda.</p>

<li>I am completely healthy and trust my immune system to fight off any virus.</li>
<li>Given the % chance of survival is so high for my age and health, if I were to ever get Covid so bad that there were serious ailments/even death, then I would believe it was something I was meant to go through.</li>
<li>The vaccine has not been tested thoroughly enough and I am concerned with the lack of available information on pros vs. cons of the vaccine, leading me to lose all trust and credibility in the gov't and leading health officials</li>
<li>The hysteria to Covid is not normal nor healthy and I don't want to give it "attention" by getting tested or the vaccine.</li>
<li>I am concerned with human rights being rolled back and an overreach of gov't control, and I truly believe that vaccines are a precursor to annual boosters and being totally tracked/traced via a vaccine passport</li>
<li>To sum up, the more pressure I feel to get it, the more I am convinced it is part of a larger Agenda and NOT in my body's best interest</li>

        <p>General rule of thumb, I  don't take medication or do medical procedures before it's throughout tested and released for a minimum of 5 years, but I'm super suspicious of why we're being bribed the way we are, I don't take bribes, and I don't take things for "free" and "for my health" when it's someone who actually wants my money.</p>

        <p>The virus, by the numbers, is not THAT dangerous.</p>
<p>The vaccine is of a new type, and hasn't gone through long term testing and results like more traditional vaccines ala polio or MMR.</p>
<p>The fact that so many people want to force me to take it while it is still experimental concerns me.</p>
<p>It doesn't keep me from getting the virus, or its variants, so just seems pointless given the risks.</p>
<p>There are risks, and nobody in the mainstream is talking about them, and people are actively removed for doing so.</p>
<p>I dont believe in compulsion by govt.</p>
<p>Dr Fauci has been shown to be lying a multitude of times, changing his story often, even going against what he later would declare was "established procedure", and lying about not funding the lab that the virus allegedly came from.</p>
<p>Many of the people pushing and funding the vaccine have also, in the past, pushed depopulation narratives.</p>
<p>there you go. a multitude of fact, numbers, and science based reasons many of us do not want to get the shot.</p>

<li>Because I believe that there is more than enough evidence to suggest that the virus is just an in for many other issues, regardless of whether the virus is real or not or the stats are cooked or not.</li>
<li>The vaccine itself is still only signed off for "Emergency Use" and despite what they say, it has still been rushed through the approval proceedure.</li>
<li>Because the Government is basically trying to force me to have it and demand I get tracked everywhere I go with a vaccine passport - which  considering reason #1 in this list, gets the old noggin going. </li>

        <p>My body my choice. In my view young people do not require this jab. It has A cost benefit profile and the adverse reactions it can cause I deem far worse for younger people. It’s also still in its trial phase with no long term data. </p>
<p>I’m sorry but if there was a deadly pandemic do you think the world leaders would meet all together and touch, hug etc? Would you need them to wheel out so called celebrity’s to promote the jab? Would it need a multi million pound GOV advertising campaign? And they have no liability over it should you die. </p>
<p>There’s been no logic in any of the decisions surrounding vaccines. You can still spread and catch COVID yet my country is about to mandate vaccine passports come Sept, where negative test will no longer be good enough. So you can be infected with COVID and double jabbed and move freely but you can’t be negative and do the same. Now it’s coercion I’m even strongly against them.</p>

        <p>It's all too political for me. Doctors playing politicians and politicians playing doctors. &amp; for that reason I'm not vaccinated. I'm watching from the side lines as this unfolds. I think the biggest problem is not the vaccine itself, but the propaganda machine behind it. Why can’t anyone talk about any other possible treatments? Like to the point that they are banned from platforms? Why is that? I have a problem with it. What happened to freedom of speech and thought? Opinions that are  alternative to the mainstream narrative, which is being jammed down our throats, are not permitted. Sounds like North Fucken Korea to me. This whole situation is unprecedented and should cause additional thought and reexamination of every step.</p>

        <p>When you see there flip side of the media you choose to listen to, then you'll understand why. Not everything, especially injections of this type, are good for healthy people, and not really meant for healthy people. Anytime the government says it's good, run!! And remember how long it took for the government to admit what they did to the black people of Tuskegee in that experiment and how many people died or were permanent damaged. Plus, you never ever vaccinate for diseases that have treatments. Your immune system is there to help, injections are meant for illnesses that don't have treatment to lessened the severity.</p>

        <p>I'm concerned by spike protein. Some studies suggest it's not inert but it has an active role in covid symptoms related to vascular system. Nobody knows in which organs the mRNA strands can end up, how long the spike proteins surface from the cell walls, if all the proteins are cleared up, what happens if they're instead released and go deposit in organs and so on..
A single shot injects you with tens of trillions of mRNA strands. I don't know how many proteins a single strand will produce before it breaks up so let's say tens of trillions at least.</p>
<p>Then I read this article. 
https://principia-scientific.com/doctor-heart-failure-from-mrna-jabs-will-kill-most-people/</p>
<p>TLDR: the spike proteins that lean from cell walls promote the formation of micro-clots that can go everywhere in the body, also in organs that can't regenerate, like heart and brain. MR scans can't show them because they're too small but eventually they'll kill the person.</p>
<p>The idea of toxic spike protein also would explain why some people get myocarditis and thrombosis with the vaccine and without even the virus.</p>
<p>Here another study:

        <p>I have autoimmune and have NEVER been sick with any coronaviral infection (there are literally thousands of mutations of coronavirus), i have seen zero evidence of perfect pcr testing (at best we are talking 30% accuracy), i have seen zero independent research validating and PROVING this gene therapy (not a vaccine) is effective at reducing symptoms or transmission, i have zero ability to handle over 300 known chemicals synthesized by big pharma, yet ive never caught the flu or pneumonia, even though I have severely weak lungs and heart. I haven't stepped foot in a drs office in 20 years since going 100% nongmo organic and use herbs, supplements and homeopathics, to keep my symptoms virtually nonexistent.
 I fast regularly, detox using juice cleanses 3x a year. 25 years ago I was given 6 months to live by a huge team of "experts".  Yeah, fuck pseudoscience and the religion that is big pharma. No way will I succumb to an invasive medical procedure as an experimental animal. Fuck no.</p>

        <p>My initial reason was the cost did not outweigh the benefit. As a younger person, my risk is astronomically low so why take my chance with a potential vaccine side effect.</p>
<p>Then came the injuries, censorship, coercion, bribing, shaming and the threats. So many red flags within a few months that it solidified my stance to never get one.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say I'm particularly hesitant. Or at least hesitant in every circumstance. </p>
<p>I think it was a good decision for my grandparents and even to a certain extent my parents to get the jab, because the possible repercussions were outweighed by the benefits. I would say the same thing for other people in similar circumstances. </p>
<p>The reason I don't want to take it is because I don't want to play the game where my ability to live my life is locked behind a medical treatment that I simply do not need.

        <p>Like many others have said, it's a risk vs. reward thing. The risks of the vaccine vs the risks of COVID. The danger of COVID vs the "benefits" of the vaccine.</p>
<p>And what, exactly are the rewards of the vaccine? It doesn't stop you from getting COVID (see TX democrats). It doesn't stop you from transmitting COVID (ibid). It doesn't allow you to reclaim your forfeited rights (see LA county mask mandate regardless of vaccine status). It *supposedly* makes the symptoms less severe (but it's already 99.97% survivable and the vast majority don't even know they have COVID; they have to be tested to find out).</p>
<p>What are the downsides of the vaccine? Death (I know 2 people who died from the vaccine and zero who died from/with COVID). Blood clots. Stroke. Heart problems. Menstrual changes / issues. No long term side effect data is available. mRNA vaccines have NEVER been tried before. Drug companies have no liability for injury or death caused by the vaccine (there won't be any ambulance chaser commercials in 5 to 10 years "if you've been injured by the COVID vaccine call us"; so I guess maybe that goes in the rewards column too?).</p>
<p>I'm just not seeing the upside to taking a novel, untested vaccine with severe / fatal side effects for a disease that most likely wont cause me any more harm than a normal case of the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>So let me turn the question around ... why would you want to take the vaccine?</p>

        <p>It hasn’t been around long enough to study. The virus itself or the vaccine. I couldn’t live with myself if day 5,10,15 years down the road I develop some sort of cancer or something. It can’t be proven that it WASNT caused by the vaccine. Sure it could be fate and it would have happened anyway but “WHAT IF” would always be in the back of my mind. Also, I’m in my late 20’s and of child bearing age (currently undergoing IVF) and again I could not live with myself if god forbid something happened to my child. Could I have done that to them? Could I have prevented their potential suffering if I didn’t get the vaccine? To me there are too many unknowns and I can’t bring myself to take that on mentally. To each their own. If you want to get it and feel safer being vaccinated then be my guest. But don’t force me to put some unknown chemical into my body that is not even FDA approved.</p>

        <p>I don’t feel at risk at all. I’ve been exposed to lots of people, I may have even had it in 6/20 but the (unreliable) tests didn’t confirm that. Getting an experimental and basically untested vaccine seemed like a guaranteed bad time.</p>

        <p>The fact that it hasn’t been throughly tested for long term side effects. I’ve had pelvic inflammatory disease and have a history of infertility because of birth control within my immediate family. So I’m very concerned about putting anything in my body that could even potentially cause infertility. I’m only 22 and I want to have a child in the next 10 years.</p>

        <p>Here is are my reasons for not taking the vaccine:</p>
<ol>
<li>The inventor of mRNA as a vaccine (Robert Malone) has spoken out against it</li>
<li>The government is pushing it too hard</li>
<li>YoY deaths have not spiked, even in non mask-mandating countries such as Sweden</li>
<li>Most people dying from this are either elderly, feeble, or in a <br>
high-risk group (avg age of covid victim is at or above age expectancy)</li>
<li>Masks don't work (it's right there on the box! Are people blind?), yet <br>
they are being pushed - this shows it is not about science</li>
<li>New technology and little testing - which means it is prone to error</li>
<li>Politicians are not following their own lockdown  rules... signs of political theatre are everywhere</li>
<li>Censorship on any dissidence whatsoever</li>
<li>Manufacturers are not liable for any health damages</li>
<li>Serious adverse health effects are happenings and are being dismissed as psychological and non-related.</li>
<li>Promising alternative treatments (ex: MATH+ cocktail) are being dismissed, despite success.</li>
<li>HCQ plants have blown up</li>
<li>This virus came from a lab. It was obvious.  We knew this in April 2020. Yet, our government refuses to acknowledge this.</li>
<li>Some of our leaders are dumb, others are deceived, and others are evil.  Either way, I don't trust them.</li>

        <p>Because it's a trial drug that is unproven and the people taking are technically the trial.</p>
<p>Also there are proven drug's that are used for other treatment's that have zero side effects that are proven to prevent you from getting Covid-19 but kill the virus if you have it.
Ivermectin is the one I'm talking about and that is also showing sign's of not only treating people who suffer from long covid but is also helping to treat the people who have suffered the adverse effects of these experimental vaccines.</p>

        <p>I have an autoimmune disorder and on the CDC website it states: 
“People with autoimmune conditions may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware that no data are currently available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people with autoimmune conditions.”

        <p>I have the vaccine but I understand why others don't want it though. It has killed people and that one drug from India seems to get rid of the virus. I know pro vaccine stuff on NNN is shunned apon, but there is a ton of evidence that the vaccine is effective and is safer than having the virus. So it has become this polarized issue where everyone takes a side and doesn't put themselves in the shoes of the others, just like democrats and republicans lol.</p>
<p>I just got the vaccine because I wanted to face my fear of getting the vaccine. I was afraid that I was going to fucking die or something after taking it, but nothing happened. My arm got sore and that's it.</p>

        <p>It’s not up to me. I’m not a mod. The mods can only clean up so much bullshit at a time. Let alone, where are all the rejects gonna flee after some of those extremists subs when down? The next closest thing would be us. I can’t help that.</p>
<p>Also not gonna go on a full on rant but in short I’m not getting the vaccine because it lacks FDA approval which means they hold no liability under EUA.</p>

        <p>Interestingly there's always "vaccine hesitancy" when a new one is introduced, this just happens to be unique in that the opinions seems to be divided along political lines: Conservative people are far more likely to distrust the Covid-19 vaccine than liberals. This isn't true for, say, the annual flu shot, tetanus, hep B, whatever.</p>
<p>That indicates that hesitancy is coming from a desire to show allegiance to a certain group: Look at all the people saying that the reason they're not getting the vaccine is as an act of resistance against an institution.</p>
<p>Actual vaccine hesitancy is far lower than it appears to be on this sub.</p>

        <p>No.  Most of the people here have had many vaccines in their life, but this shot is untested and not approved yet and they're concerned that there could be unknown side effects that could affect them for the rest of their life for a virus that has close to a 0% chance of killing most people.</p>

        <p>As I said. The virus has about a 0% chance of killing me and is therefore useless to me, just like the flu shot.  My parents are older and I supported them getting it.</p>
<p>This shot is untested and unapproved and there are certain conditions that have spiked since people started taking it.  Things like myocarditis and pericarditis.  I'll wait until it's fully approved and tested before I would consider it.</p>
