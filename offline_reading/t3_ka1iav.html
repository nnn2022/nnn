    <strong>A Couple Thought Experiments re "If the pandemic magically disappears right now, what would you do right away?"</strong>
    <p><p>So at the present moment there's <a href="http://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k9m592/if_the_pandemic_magically_disappears_right_now/">a very popular post</a> on /r/askreddit asking what you'd do if "the pandemic magically disappear[ed] right now." And it reminded me of a couple thought experiments I thought up a while back:</p>
<ol>
<li>Imagine if the virus just disappeared tomorrow. However, the restrictions have gone nowhere. The media still reports on COVID-19 like it exists, and they still claim that hospitals are right on the brink of being overwhelmed and that we need a vaccine. You can still get tested, and the test may come back positive, but no one is actually sick with it in the sense that they have symptoms or need treatment. There are deaths announced, but they're completely fabricated. What do you think would happen? Would anyone even notice the virus was gone?</li>
<li>Imagine if every mayor, governor, president and prime minister quietly lifted all restrictions. Plus, the media stops talking about COVID-19. There's no more "numbers" being published. You can't get tested, even if you want to be. Even the vaccine is a thing of the past. Yet, the virus is still circulating. What do you think will happen? Would life go back to normal?</li>
</ol>
<p>Obvious it would be better to ask the doomers, but I'm interested what everyone here thinks.</p></p>

<p>Not for a lot of people. I genuinely believe that a fair part of the population has been permanently psychologically damaged by this extended campaign of trauma based mind control/propaganda to the point where they're incapable of going "back to normal."</p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking that could be the case for some people, too albeit a minority. However, there are a lot of doomers who don’t view pre-pandemic movies and TV shows the same way, noticing no masks or social distancing and may “have to be reprogrammed”. I’ve also seen some saying they will never look at people (Americans at least) the same way ever again. Along with the trauma resulting from the propaganda and brainwashing, I think some people (I’m thinking a minority) may have become dependent on the “new normal” lifestyle that if the pandemic ended, they might genuinely struggle to return to the old normal.</p>

        <p>There needs to be a day when we declare this officially over and put it all behind us. Otherwise this will permanently alter the world for the foreseeable future. Masks and social distancing will become the norm. Which is what I think they wanted all along with a "new normal." </p>
<p>I really believe this is only the beginning. Its like a kidnapper puts cuffs on you and throws you in a basement and you say, when can I leave? And the kidnapper says, when your good enough. </p>
<p>Anyone who can exercise logic knows your never getting out and hes only making you believe youll be set free if you behave so you wont slip the cuffs and murder him. </p>
<p>Doomers are like the Jews who believed if they werr good enough citizens the Nazis would be nice to them. They keep believing this even as they step on the train to Auschwitz.</p>

        <p>I’d go visit my grandma in the rehab hospital. She fell and broke her hip a couple of weeks ago and I’ve only been able to call her. Thankfully she’s alright but not being able to actually visit has been shitty.</p>

        <p>These are great thought experiments. My perspective:</p>
<p>1) Yes doctors would figure out very quickly if coronavirus suddenly disappeared. It might take a few days for this to work itself out. My guess is 2 weeks and we are totally back to normal after people stop freaking out. </p>
<p>2) If the politicians stopped pumping the fear machine 24/7 my guess is that a few people are so brainwashed at this point they would continue to socially distance and wear masks. I think maybe after a month we are back to normal. </p>
<p>The average person just wouldn’t even know we were in a “pandemic.” This virus just isn’t that deadly.</p>

<p>Would they? How many doctors look at COVID-19 directly? And if a doctor claimed the virus disappeared, I find it hard to believe he'd be thought of as anything but a conspiracy theorist.</p>

        <p>Radiologists- covid has a very characteristic appearance on chest CT. Very few things can look like it- it looks nothing like typical bacterial pneumonia and very different from influenza. A big hospital would go from seeing 10-20 of these CTs a day to 0 and everyone would wonder what the F happened. </p>
<p>Without a PCR test, CT is the biggest differentiator. There’s some clinical differences as well but those are more subtle.</p>

        <p>I think even if the virus were still around, if masks as a “visual reminder” went away, and all the media hubbub and Governor edicts went away, I think that there would be significantly lower cases and deaths, almost as a placebo effect.</p>
