Dr. Scoglio: here are my doubts about Coronavirus</p>
<p>I made this post to explain really happening in Italy with the Coronavirus
Given that SARS-CoV 2 has been accused of causing very serious and unique respiratory symptoms (Covid-19), can anyone provide me with the study that proves it?</p>
<p>I am sure you are familiar with Koch's 4 postulates , which are the foundation of any microbiological research. So where is the study where they isolated the virus; they put it in a culture; they injected it as a purified virus into an animal; they recorded both the symptoms that the virus is expected to cause and its significant proliferation in the host. This is the only type of study that can prove causality in relation to a disease by any organism (the virus obviously cannot even be defined as an organism, but the rules also apply to viruses). I have searched for such a study a lot, but I have not been able to find it. It's certainly due to my limitations, so I'll be happy to be enlightened by anyone who can do it (I doubt anyone will do it, though).</p>
<p>There is the further problem of identifying and detecting the virus. At GISAID, the international genomic institute, there are different and different genome sequences from SARS-Cov-2, which suggests that we are talking about different viruses; or who don't really know what they're talking about.</p>
<p>As for the detection of the virus , various studies show that the RT-PCR testused for SARS-CoV2 (or should I say the different PCR methods used in different countries), provides about 80% of false positives, that is they are totally unreliable. I myself have analyzed the basic study that sets the standards for SARS-Cov-2 detection (Corman VM, Drosten C. et al. 2020. Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR. Euro Surveill 25. doi: 10.2807 / 1560 7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045), and I have discovered that the same authors implicitly admit that their test has about 70% probability of success; while a more in-depth analysis, which I cannot develop here, shows that in fact the degree of probability of real detection is much lower. It does not seem to be a very solid ground for closing the world economy!</p>
<p>Then there is the problem of infectivity or contagiousness : how is it possible that a virus from China , which is said to be the most contagious in history, leaps from China, bypassing entire continents, and ends up in two small Italian cities, Bergamo and Brescia?And then, how is it possible that from Bergamo and Brescia the super contagious virus did not massively infect Milan? In Bergamo and Brescia there were 800 deaths attributed to Covid-19 before Italy proceeded to the lockdown; in the 3 weeks from the start of the alleged blockade infection, how is it possible that Milan, a city of 5 million people, which is practically united to Bergamo by a series of cities that connect the two neighboring cities, after a month from the infection instead of the tens of thousands of infected and the thousands of deaths that could be expected, did it have only 1,000 infected and not 100 deaths? Hence, this virus is intelligent enough to be contagious when it wants and non-contagious when it doesn't want to (which by the way raises the most fundamental questions: how can a piece of RNA covered by a protein, that is, a molecule, want something? We continue to treat viruses as if they were alive, but they are not, they are only molecular compounds) .</p>
<p>And let's take a look at epidemiology. Do some people claim that there has been a huge wave of deaths around the world? Where is it? The only place where there apparently died above the average are still the two provinces of Bergamo and Brescia, where about 2/3 of all Italian deaths occurred; which again raises the question of why such a dangerous and super-contagious virus affects only those two provinces (some critics argue that it is because those two provinces were actually subject to a massive vaccination campaign, which administered 185,000 flu vaccines and more than 35,000 meningococcal vaccines at the same time during December 2019 - but let's not open this discussion now). However, the total deaths attributed to the virus crown in Italy, after two months, were just over 7,500. Now,were they definitely due to the corona virus? Well, given the unreliability of the test, it's hard to say, isn't it? However, the Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, the official scientific body of the Italian government, examined the medical records of 2003 people declared dead of coronavirus and concluded that only 24 could be considered with certainty killed by the corona virus, all the others being an average age of 81 years and with 2 or 3 or more lethal diseases (such as cancer, advanced diabetes and cardiovascular diseases). If we apply the same standard to the 9,000 people who are said to have died so far from the virus crown in Italy, this would give a total of 108 people who died from the virus crown, an almost insignificant figure compared to the 1800 people who die in Italy every day. But I'm sure now the ISS,considered one of the main scientific bodies in the world, it is and will be ignored as the last of the charlatans ...</p>
<p>In any case, even if we decide to attribute to SARS-Cov-2 all 9,000 people with an average age of 79.5 years and with at least 1 (24%), 2 (25%) or 3 (49.8% ) lethal diseases, 9,000 deaths in two months make about 4,500 deaths per month; although it would not be fair to multiply that number by 12, since in winter there are obviously more people who die from respiratory problems, if however we multiply it by 12, we get 54,000 people who died from respiratory problems caused by the corona virus. In recent years in Italy the number of people who have died from respiratory diseases has always been 53-55,000, exactly the same. These are the numbers available on the ISTAT website, the national statistical body.Are we simply calling the same respiratory problems that people die of this year under another name? Are we obsessively paying attention to an absolutely normal number of deaths like an unprecedented catastrophe just because respiratory deaths are put on the front page of all media 24/7? The real numbers seem to say it.</p>
<p>I know I've been for a long time, and I apologize, but my doubts are many and I ask to be enlightened , but I still suspect that the mainstream will adopt the usual tactic against uncomfortable questions: ignore them!</p>
