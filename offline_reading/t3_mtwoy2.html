        <p>This. I've been saying this for almost a year now. The scientists working on the virus in microscopical basis wear special respirators to keep themselves immune. What makes you think your bandana is going to keep you safe</p>

<p>Uhh the news told me. And the news told me I can trust them. And the news says it isn't propaganda because only Fox News does propaganda. If the news was playing up my fear to sell a narrative, they would give me a warning. Fascists always warn you before they take over, everyone knows this.</p>

        <p>Okay, I lurk this place and I'll admit that I'm much more of a believer in COVID than most people here, and though I think precautions are necessary I genuinely believe governments have botched the response at every step</p>
<p>I just need a genuine response much like I felt about the massive protests last year being okay while most of us weren't allowed to work and so forth</p>
<p>In what world does a fascist government encourage people to cover their faces up?   That seems contradictory.</p>

        <p>Baby steps, they aren't just going to come out and say "hey we want fascism/totalitarianism, is that okay?". They will say, "guys there is a super duper serious emergency and you must give us emergency powers that we promise to give back. You don't hate your community or our most vulnerable and marginalized people do you?" </p>
<p>Then they pass laws that test the water, if the public doesn't resist then they make it permanent. If the public does resist, "woah its not tyranny guys, its just a little mandate, selfish." If the public still doesn't give in, "hey we were always going to give up our emergency powers."</p>
<p>The loss of identity and demoralization and mobbing when one fights for their identity is a big part of the mask mandates too.</p>
<p>But there is so much more at play than just forced masks and vaccines. There's politicians knowingly crashing the economy so they can go out in public all alone and accusing the peasants of being selfish for calling them out, for one.</p>
<p>Think of any government that turned tyrannical and it almost always leads to emergency powers. (Guess where the word dictator comes from?) Even the Empire from Star Wars did it, and that's a movie.</p>

        <p>Okay, but I live in LA, and honestly nothing really ever closed.  Our mayor at one point came out and said they flat out didn't have the resources to enforce bans, and as soon as the CDC said they dropped the ball with surface transmission our grocery stores stopped giving out hand sanitizer. </p>
<p>I just don't see a grand conspiracy here, because I don't believe that most government employees are capable of wiping their asses without assistance, let alone putting some grand conspiracy into place.  </p>
<p>I should know - I used to be a staffer for Congressman Darrell Issa.  Incompetence at every level?  Yes.  </p>
<p>The right for politicizing the mask issue that mostly hurts their voting block, and the left for politicizing a fucking pandemic of all things to make government more bloated and putting the collective governance of a nation into the hands of a epidemiologist who of course doesn't consider the economic or social impacts of his policy because it's not his fucking job.  </p>
<p>Imo the federal government failed as an institution and proved it could never actually be authoritarian because if you can't even set up contact tracing, how the fuck are you going to lord over a population?</p>

        <p>I have to reject that the "right did politicize masks". Some crazy people flipped out in a store, yes, but so did pro mask people. Both committed assaults too. The right "politicized masks" when they simply said they didn't like illegal mandates and government fines, especially after hearing ACAB for two weeks straight then hearing the ACAB crowd demand fines/jail for noncompliance.</p>

        <p>Mandates were mostly enforced by private businesses which at least in my city (I can't speak to anyone else's experience) took the initiative because they didn't like the prospect of shutting down and massively testing everyone because of one positive test.  </p>
<p>I don't recall any government fines, but again, I can only speak to my experience.  </p>
<p>If you have an issue with rioters, I'm with you, but take it up with them.  I know I was pissed at the government response in my city and state, Especially when they burnt down my friends shop on our local news.  I also got pissed because as the age old adage goes "If you burn down a government building with no politicians in it, all you've done is raise your own taxes"</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Still, I didn't see the need to complain about mask wearing since it mostly served as an advisory and it's a public health issue.  Not exactly the Army requesting quarter. </p>
<p>It just slightly annoys me that people care so much about what other people do?  If someone wants to wear a mask a year from now, let them.  Perhaps they're from a culture like Japan or South Korea, where mask wearing is routine and normal if you feel under the weather</p>

        <p>You can check medical journals they do talk and examine the efficiency of common surgical masks or the other one. For example the german government only approves of the surgical mask and ffp mask cloth masks are not approved. You can of course use more effective masks but they are costly and not very accessible. Common surgical mask will be less effective but it will still block some of the air you breathe out. Its more about protecting others than protecting yourself. Thats why people have been wearing surgical masks in east asia when they got sick.</p>

        <p>guess it‘s still more effective than no mask 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p>like when you can‘t afford a jacket in winter you still would put on a sweater even though it can‘t keep you warm enough</p>

        <p>Not a good comparison. I wear warm clothes on the winter because I can actually see it's efficiency, where as when it comes to the efficiency of masks against covid, no matter how you look at it, they don't provide any enough amount of efficiency</p>

        <p>Cloth masks are better than nothing at preventing spread away from the wearer.</p>
<p>Many places do explicitly call out thin single layer masks like gaiters which actually do not produce measurable reductions in transmission.</p>
<p>The CDC screwed up messaging at the beginning by jumping the gun on saying masks were unnecessary before data came in, and now they're just trying to get whatever level of compliance they can get.</p>

<p>Wearing a scuba gear in dry land will save you from drowning </p>

<p>Feeding poison to an already dead person will kill him</p>

<p>No. The data was there long before the outbreak. Problem is, after a certain point, some people decided that covid 19 is a good disaster to be wasted</p>

        <p>The whole case with seatbelts is different. We are told that if we wear seatbelts and drive 60 km/h we will end up mostly fine after an accident. If we were told that we have to wear a seatbelt and drive 60 km/h but we will still die if we have an accident then not a single soul would've  used a seatbelt</p>

<p>if you are scared that you're going to get sick you can buy an n95 respirator- which have been proven to protect you</p>
<p>but the idea with cloth masks is that if everyone wears one they protect one another so if you were fucking considerate enough to wear a piece of cloth over your mouth and nose then it would go away so much faster</p>

        <p>alright then</p>
<p>i'm not saying humans are to blame for the virus itself, but i am saying the stupidity of many hundreds of thousands of people are to blame for the high death rate and how long this virus has been going on for. </p>
<p>paraphrasing from the article about infections on the cdc's website, infections come from germs. these germs can be carried by someone who was exposed to them and can be transmitted when a healthy person is touched by or inhales water droplets given off by that infected person. a direct quote from the section on transmission is "Germs don’t move themselves. Germs depend on people, the environment, and/or medical equipment to move in healthcare settings." </p>
<p>in what way am i the evil one here for stating proven facts</p>

<p>In my native language we have a saying that's made for situations just like this:</p>

<p>CDC and WHO pretty much repeat whatever bullshit Fauci comes up with and vice versa. </p>

<p>Oh really? Me not wearing mask causes people like you to do die? Good to know. I'll double down on my effort on not wearing a mask then. </p>

<p>No thank you. I'm not scared at all. Even if I do get the rona I have a 99.97% chance of surviving it.</p>

        <p>You mask isn’t to stop the transmission of the virus if it is in a particle, but most of the time it’s could be in dust, saliva, and anything that can come out of your mouth or nose. Anytime you break bacteria comes out on spit and many things it’s to stop thing like that.</p>

        <p>Let's say for the sake of the argument what you say is completely true. If masks actually did work as properly as you claim they do, we all would've grabbed a face mask and go back to living the way we used to. Wouldn't we?</p>

        <p>No because you still have two hands, clothes and the rest of your body to pick up germs. A mask isn't a guarantee you're not going to pick up germs and bacteria, it's a precaution like a condom 😉 it isn't 100% accurate its 97% accurate. Instead of overwhelming hospitals all at once..mask 😁😁😁😁</p>

<p>A variety of studies show the effectiveness of a facial covering in containing the “respiratory jet” that emerges from your mouth when you cough. It is not 100% effective, as the linked study suggests, but it does a pretty darn good job of keeping your germs from reaching somebody else through the air.</p>
<p>It is true that special respirators would do a better job. But public health decisions are a balance between effectiveness and practicality. We cannot hope to get hundreds of millions of respirator devices for all Americans, and we certainly cannot hope to get most of them to wear such uncomfortable devices at all times. So instead, we opt for a measure that helps quite a bit while not being too inconvenient. </p>
<p>Regardless, there’s quite a bit of information out there showing just how much the “bandana” helps. You’ll find that in general, it’s not perfect but it helps. Trust the scientific community with their studies of this - they know a lot more than the average person. There are people who specialize in studying the movement of small particles (like viruses) in airflows, from medical researchers to aerospace engineers. </p>
<p>If such a small step can be taken to significantly lower transmission, why not take it?</p>

        <p>Where does it conclude that? I’m in a rush so only skimmed - very possible I missed it. But what I did see was a statement that mask-wearing, among other things, should be adhered to. I also saw a table comparing positive and negative COVID test results with mask usage - but the p value for the mask usage portion of this was 0.86. If I remember my statistics, that is an absolute world away from the recommended p value of 0.05 for drawing conclusions. 0.86 indicates extreme randomness. That would be why, unless I missed something, the study did not go so far as to literally conclude that masks make no difference. </p>
<p>If I am in error due to only skimming, please let me know. </p>
<p>If I am not, well then I encourage you to be careful when drawing your own conclusions from study data if you are not experienced in such things (I don’t claim to be either, but as I’m a researcher in a different field I have some idea). Read what the study itself concludes, don’t just try to pick out data that seems to agree with your point.</p>

        <p>Remember consensus is about the data not the scientists, don't confuse the two. How many examples you need from past to realize consensus of scientists can be wrong. Even if all the scientists agree man was made in god's image it can't deny the validity of Darwin's work and thus remember as you said the replicability factor in the researches count not the opinion of brightest minds of the day. As someone in cancer research i know replicability in this field is very low sure there are many reasons for it biggest one being negative results are not published also unless someone performs the experiment mentioned it is impossible to detect data manipulation particularly when there is incentive for it, no amount of peer review is going to be able to catch this manipulation.</p>

        <p>Also- be extremely careful about what information/memes you see from social media platforms like FB that try to erode confidence in our institutions. Other countries are waging war on Americans. While this hasn't been proven specially for mask claims, it could be a real easy way for our enemies to kill Americans without shooting a gun.</p>

        <p>Yes, I obviously read it. How else would I know it was titled, <em>Facemasks in the COVID-19 era: A health hypothesis</em>?</p>
<p>What I said stands. It is presented as a hypothesis, nothing more.</p>
<p>Before you continue to make shit up, you should get a grasp on the scientific method. Find out what the difference is between a hypothesis, a study  a theory, and a scientific law is. The doctor who wrote it obviously does, because <strong>he presented it as a fucking hypothesis!</strong></p>

        <p>No one in the scientific community would cite a hypothesis in an attempt to make a believable argument for a theory. </p>
<p>Hypotheses are tested over and over again until a clear pattern is established and a theory may be formed. My sister graduated with PhD in Chemistry while I persued computer science and psychology. I'm fairly well acquainted with how this works. </p>
<p>You should look up something called confirmation bias.</p>

        <p>In case you actually are arguing in good faith, here is why you’re wrong</p>
<p>The paper examines the fucking hypothesis in the title and makes a conclusion about it. This should be a good lesson on why you should not sprout bullshit with zero knowledge.</p>
<p>Nobody will publish a paper if all you have is a hypothesis. Anyone can have a hypothesis. It’s testing the hypothesis and providing evidence that gets you published.</p>

        <p>While I agree with you in principle, I disagree with the specifics on this paper. I think that you are overlooking that this arthor has several articles with this publication. I suspect those with a history of publishing have a somewhat easier time getting published again than those who are looking to be published the first time.</p>
<p>Also, this paper brings in information from a wide variety of previously completed studies only to support the hypothesis. In this way, it can only be said to show a correlation.</p>
<p>It is much easier to support your hypothesis if you only have to grab bits and pieces from other studies. The flat earth crowd do nothing but that approach. It is much easier than designing a study to prove cause and effect.</p>

        <p>I agree with some of your points, disagree with some other. </p>
<p>Let's say for the sake of the argument, that the article you shared is 100% correct (I'd actually argue with you on why I believe it's not but let's move on for now). </p>
<p>Here's a question for you and people who published the article: If cloth masks are actually as effective as you claim they are, why can't we all just grab a mask and go back to living the way we used to before the outbreak? </p>
<p>Now I know the efficiency isn't supposed to be either 0 or 100, but it's either enough efficiency or simply not enough efficiency. In case of covid we're told that even if we get vaccinated, we should still wear masks and socially and physically distance ourselves from others, which, brings us to my point about the efficiency of the whole process and how it falls on the "not effective enough" side. </p>
<p>&rt;Trust the scientific community</p>
<p>The only reason that science is accepted as "science" and is receiving credit for it is because throughout the time it was questioned so much by so many people and in return, it managed to provide proper answers to literally all and every single one of those questions. So no, I can't trust the mainstream wannabe "doctors" who you refer to as "scientific community", because they're doing the exact opposite of what an actual expert would do. </p>
<p>Btw, let me give you a friendly advice as a computer science student. My field requires me to spend a lot of time on the internet (from 8 to 12 hours a day when I'm actually working). As someone who has spent that much time on the internet for almost half a decade now, I assure you that 99% of EVERYTHING you see on the internet is completely false. Everything. Movie reviews, app reviews, social media comments, news, different articles on different fields and even medical researches. For instance, up until couple of years ago, you could hardly find any article on the internet that had something negative to say about veganism. Meanwhile every "real life expert" I knew was strongly advising against it. </p>
<p>Me and people like me didn't develop our beliefs over night, we didn't develop our beliefs because we don't like masks, we do this because we realized data A provided by the experts doesn't add up by data B provided by the same experts</p>

<p>What field in computer science requires constant attention to the Internet? That sounds like a gross exaggeration to me.  My systems are constantly connected to Internet as well, but I'd hardly claim I'm "on the net" the entire time I'm at work. </p>
<p>I have a lot more to do than browse "movie reviews, app reviews, social media comments, news, different articles on different fields and even medical researches."

<p>It does. I mean when you're a newbie in this field you spend way too much time on the internet. I know it's not something to "boast about" and that wasn't my intention either. It's just what it is. </p>
<p>When you're a newbie and you don't have enough skills and knowledge, when you run into a problem, you have to spend time on different internet platforms looking for ways to solve the problem. Sometimes I go weeks looking for a solution to a single problem. Now that our uni courses are online, I have to spend even more time on the internet (not that I was learning too many useful things there). Now combine all of that with living in a third world country that doesn't have access to a lot of hardwares and even softwares, and living in a city that doesn't have any proper community for stuff like this and you'll see why I spend that much time on the net. </p>
<p>It's also one of the reasons I came back to reddit, despite my profound hatred for this site.</p>

        <p>There are companies overseas that are hired to give false reviews of products to inflate numbers.</p>
<p>Also critics and companies that do reviews often have a conflict of interest in giving a good review. There are cases where I think the reputation of the "third party" is important enough that they do an impartial job. But movie reviews which are simply for marketing are just not one of them.</p>

        <p>Okayyy, I’m gonna have to hit back on some of this stuff, particularly towards the end.</p>
<p>Your dismissal of the scientific community and scientific consensus is baseless. There is no reason to refer to actual medical researchers as “wannabe”. They get their doctorate degrees, going through rigorous years of training and experience and mentorship to learn the art of research. And even then, their findings are heavily scrutinized by their peers and superiors in peer-reviewing before publication is allowed. I frankly don’t even understand where your entire paragraph on discrediting doctors is coming from. What do you mean they’re doing the exact opposite of what an actual expert would do? Are you aware of what actual experts would do?</p>
<p>Your advice as a computer science student is welcome. It’s definitely true that a lot of the Internet is fake. Let me also give you some advice, as an Aerospace Engineering PhD candidate. Peer-reviewed scientific journals, and studies by actual government and research institutions, are not “fake”, especially in STEM fields. You seem to be blindly grouping these sorts of things with the nonsense that the Internet produces, like random comment sections. They are nothing alike. The idea of scientific consensus and community existed well before the Internet - would you have said it was “fake” then? </p>
<p>“Fakeness” isn’t some title to affix to whatever seems fishy. Read the actual study and understand. I am admittedly experienced with reading and interpreting publications, as a PhD candidate, so take this further advice from me: the article I linked makes sense. It’s a good study that provides some solid conclusions. I’ve also spoken with some aerodynamics researchers who used interesting laser-based methods to measure the spread of respiratory particles with and without masks. Their study was conducted well and confirmed similar results. </p>
<p>If you’re going to discredit a study, you need to be able to read through it and point out what doesn’t add up within it. Frankly, many of the people who try to discredit studies like you don’t even have the ability to understand what they are reading. I don’t want to make any assumptions about you, but it is a general frustration of mine. Far too many people think that some Googling and a BS degree (if that) makes them qualified to put down research that’s often in a field they know literally nothing about. </p>
<p>Our entire society is built upon trusting people to know what they’re doing. If you can’t do that, then don’t drive over bridges or take elevators or antibiotics, don’t ever start up a car, and don’t put on deodorant. Oh sure, there are plenty of studies explaining how they work and why they’re safe, but why listen to “fake doctors”? Why listen to “experts”? Surely you know better. </p>
<p>As for your other points about the masks themselves, I wish the world were that simple dude. The fact of the matter is that this isn’t as simple as “grab a mask and go back to daily life”. Masks help reduce spread, but the chance of spreading increases alarmingly with proximity and <em>duration</em> of contact. Passing someone in the store while both of you are wearing a mask - one of you coughs, well that’s fine! The mask and the brief period of passing by almost certainly prevented the spread of COVID. Just statistically speaking, some high % of particles didn’t even make it past your mask, and the few that did most likely did not land in such a way to affect someone walking by a few feet away for a very brief period in time.</p>
<p>Now picture wearing a mask and sitting in a car together for hours. This is a different story. Most particles coming out of your mouth will be blocked, but over the course of hours the amount of escaped particles will increase and increase. Soon, there’s a pretty decent chance that enough would make their way into another person’s system, especially someone sitting just 3 feet away. </p>
<p>Does that make sense? It’s understandable if you really sit down and think about it. The world isn’t just this or that, it’s usually some sort of complicated mix. And this is an example: masks are great, but to really reduce spread adding distancing and duration limits helps <em>even more</em>.</p>

        <p>Scientific consensus can be incredibly powerful but scientific consensus is not what people think it is. It is not consensus of scientists in the field rather is the consensus nature of the data across multiple unrelated and independent experiments. Keep in mind paradigm shifts in science is common and when it happens it breaks the consensus of scientists to bring about the new model, same was true for Darwin, same for Gallileo and if there is legit data then its true now as well. Also before you defend peer review, trust me its not fool proof at all</p>

        <p>Scientific consensus is brought to us through scientists. They achieve and interpret their data. The vast majority of people are not qualified or experienced enough to do so, which is why we listen to scientists.</p>
<p>Also, scientists having been wrong before is not cause to ignore scientists right now. That’s a flawed argument. Scientific <em>consensus</em> has helped us achieve remarkable things for decades now and there’s no reason to expect that stopped for just COVID.</p>

        <p>I am simply saying trust the science not the scientists, sure vast majority of people are not but those who are should evaluate the data themselves and try to educate the people. When people talk about logical fallacies one of the most common is appeal to authority and trusting just the scientist is same as that. Again i am not with any side, i laughed at the plandemic documentary and that's another point where trusting the scientist would have been wrong. Now let me give you an example in india for frontline doctors hcq was heavily used and ICMR published reports suggesting that hcq is effective and safe but USA cdc was strictly against it, now which consensus u wanna go with. Its probably better to just study the actual papers and evaluate whether it was effective or not can everyone do it probably not but if I can i will always choose to do so.</p>

        <p>Ok let's see. </p>
<p>&rt;Your dismissal of the scientific community and scientific consensus is baseless</p>
<p>No no no. Don't get me wrong, I'm not dismissing the entire scientific community. My problem is with the "Fauci gang". Because one, like I said before, the data provided by them doesn't add up and two, the "real life experts" I know, the ones I truly trust (I trust them because I've seen the results of their work), are advising against pretty much everything the mainstream "experts" are saying. From masks and how useless they are in case of covid to covid vaccines and how questionable they are. </p>
<p>&rt;Peer-reviewed scientific journals, and studies by actual government and research institutions, are not “fake”, especially in STEM fields.</p>
<p>That's because the data provided in STEM fields is much different from the data provided in medical field. Generally speaking, in STEM fields, the data provided is much more solid than the data provided in medical field. </p>
<p>&rt;Far too many people think that some Googling and a BS degree (if that) makes them qualified to put down research that’s often in a field they know literally nothing about. </p>
<p>I completely agree with you on that one. I pretty much don't trust anything or anyone on the internet. Which is why whenever I'm having any trouble, I don't use internet to find a solution for it, I look for real experts in real life and ask them to offer me a solution. </p>
<p>As for the other part of your statement, hate to admit, but you're right: even if I do read the article you shared, I probably won't understand it. Who am I kidding? My field is completely irrelevant to the medical field and truth be told I always sucked at biology. Which is another reason why when I'm facing issues like this I go straight to doctors and health experts that I truly trust. They usually offer useful information with simple explanations.</p>
<p>&rt;Our entire society is built upon trusting people to know what they’re doing. If you can’t do that, then don’t drive over bridges or take elevators</p>
<p>Not a good comparison. If architect X built 10 bridges out of which, 8 have collapsed then I would NEVER under no circumstances cross the remaining 2 bridges built by him that are still intact. </p>
<p>I could come up with more examples but I guess you get the point. </p>
<p>As for last section of your statement, the part about masks, I've gotta say around me 4 people had the covid. I know for a fact that 3 of them were as pro mask as you can possibly get. Btw, one of them is a front line worker and one of the "real life experts" I was referring to. He was also one of the people who strongly adviced me to not to wear a mask. </p>
<p>The question is, if the masks (contrary to your argument)  are supposed to protect the person wearing them, then why it didn't protect them? </p>
<p>If masks are supposed to protect people around me and prevent ME from stopping the spread (because if we go with your logic, people who are infected, got the virus from people like me who don't wear masks) then why didn't I, or people like me didn't have it worse than the ones wearing a mask? </p>
<p>The experts you refer to, don't provide a proper explanation for these questions, however the experts that I trust, do:</p>
<p>Masks are useful only in certain situations. However if they aren't used correctly they will actually increase YOUR chances of getting sick. Inside the mask has a humid and warm environment, making it the perfect place for the bacteria and maybe even germs to grow and reproduce. Unless you change your mask in every 10 minutes or so and wash your face every time you change the mask. </p>
<p>One more thing. We might disagree with one another on this issue but I'm actually happy I had this discussion with you. It's good to see someone from the opposing point of view who is not a 15 y/o kid desperate to gain some attention. </p>
<p>Know that your comment and the time and effort you put in writing it is truly appreciated. Be well</p>

        <p>&rt;but it's either enough efficiency or simply not enough efficiency.</p>
<p>That's a false dichotomy. Generally, you want to decrease risk as much as possible. Imagine you're in a war, in the middle of the enemy fire line. How do you try not to die? You can put on some bulletproof vests, this won't make you immortal and you can still get shot in the face, but will make it harder for an enemy to kill you. Is it enough to save you 100% of the time from anyone ever shooting at you? Of course not. Would you wear it if given choice in a combat situation? Probably. It does increase your chances of survival. </p>
<p>If you want a 100% effective solution because everything else is useless in your opinion, we'd have to get every single person on earth to stay home for 2 weeks and not interact with anyone else. That's not feasible though, since there are jobs that need people to be there physically, and you need people to eat to survive. So, grocery stores which require people to stock, other people to deliver to, someone to actually make food, etc. </p>
<p>You're right that masks are not effective enough by themselves. People in the military, even if wearing bulletproof vests, won't just stand in front of a gun getting shot at. They will dig up trenches and generally avoid getting shot as much as possible, not because bulletproof vests are useless, but because you want to minimize the risk as much as possible. Masks are similar, they will decrease your chances of getting sick or getting others sick, but also, best way to stay safe is to stay away from anyone that may be a carrier, or if you're a carrier, to stay away from healthy people. </p>
<p>&rt;If cloth masks are actually as effective as you claim they are, why can't we all just grab a mask and go back to living the way we used to before the outbreak?</p>
<p>If you lived in a war zone with constant gun fire, but had a bulletproof vest, would you take casual walks in the park or throwaway the vest? Personally, I'd avoid leaving any safe zones as much as possible, and when having to go out to get food or whatever, I'd wear the vest. This is also how I currently treat a mask.</p>
<p>&rt;The only reason that science is accepted as "science" and is receiving credit for it is because throughout the time it was questioned so much by so many people and in return, it managed to provide proper answers to literally all and every single one of those questions.</p>
<p>That's not exactly how science works. The scientific method includes </p>
<ol>
<li>Asking a question</li>
<li>Doing background research</li>
<li>Constructing a hypothesis</li>
<li>Test with an experiment</li>
<li>Examine your experiment for flawed data/procedure</li>
<li>Analyze data and draw conclusions</li>
<li>Communicate results</li>
</ol>
<p>Nowhere near all and every single scientific question has been answered.  However, a scientist generally can write down a procedure for an experiment and other scientists should be able to duplicate results. For example, if I tell you to put a jar of salt water in your bedroom and wait until it evaporates, after it evaporates you will be able to find salt crystals in your jar. This is an example of a repeatable experiment which gives credibility to science. </p>
<p>&rt;So no, I can't trust the mainstream wannabe "doctors" who you refer to as "scientific community", because they're doing the exact opposite of what an actual expert would do.</p>
<p>You trust facebook aunts more than people that spent years reading actual scientific papers and doing independent reproducible research that scientists agree on? What makes you say they're doing the opposite of what an actual expert would do?</p>
<p>&rt;Btw, let me give you a friendly advice as a computer science student. My field requires me to spend a lot of time on the internet (from 8 to 12 hours a day when I'm actually working). As someone who has spent that much time on the internet for almost half a decade now, I assure you that 99% of EVERYTHING you see on the internet is completely false. Everything. Movie reviews, app reviews, social media comments, news, different articles on different fields and even medical researches. For instance, up until couple of years ago, you could hardly find any article on the internet that had something negative to say about veganism. Meanwhile every "real life expert" I knew was strongly advising against it.</p>
<p>Btw, let me give you some friendly advice as a software engineer that spends most of the day on the internet and actually makes a living from it. Not everything is part of a conspiracy theory or fake, just because it exists on the internet. Science has not answered all of the questions of the universe yet, and it is always evolving and new data is constantly emerging. Some sources are more reliable than others, and facebook memes are not the best place to get your information from. Critical thinking and media literacy are skills that will do you a lot of good if you manage to develop them. </p>
<p>&rt;Me and people like me didn't develop our beliefs over night, we didn't develop our beliefs because we don't like masks, we do this because we realized data A provided by the experts doesn't add up by data B provided by the same experts</p>
<p>Please try to review how the scientific process works and it will help you immensely with understanding it.</p>

<p>Yes, I would wear it because I can actually see it's efficiency where as when it comes to efficiency of masks against covid, there really isn't enough efficiency, no matter how you look at it. </p>
<p>They're as effective as carrying an umbrella in the desert in the middle of the summer to avoid getting wet under the rain. </p>
<p>Or as effective as using a fishnet as a condom </p>
<p>Or as effective as using barricade as a rat trap </p>
<p>You get the point. </p>

<p>I trust real life experts who I'm 100% sure have a decent degree in the medical field and have been in this field for years including doctors who I have attended to throughout the recent years for various of health related problems and a group of my friends who I've known since high schools and right now they're frontline workers and work as nurses in hospitals. Wanna know something funny? Literally all and every single one of them, WITHOUT A SINGLE EXCEPTION, strongly advised me against masks and coronavirus vaccine. </p>
<p>Nice try at trying to make us all look like bunch of anti science boomers who's only redeemable quality is browsing facebook tho, but it's not gonna work. </p>
<p>&rt;Btw, let me give you some friendly advice as a software engineer that spends most of the day on the internet and actually makes a living from it. Not everything is part of a conspiracy theory</p>
<p>Call me a conspiracy theorist all you want, it will do absolutely nothing to change my views and at the end of the day I'll take being a conspiracy theorist over being some individual who blindly accepts everything on the news or on some supposedly medical website.</p>

<p>Which data would that be? The data saying vaccines are more effective than masks? Not being in a war zone is more effective at avoiding bullets than bulletproof vests, but you still said you'd wear one.</p>
<p>&rt;Genuine question: how did you come so close to getting the point and still missed it? </p>

<p>Sorry that your friends are all idiots. May want to get a second opinion on your health related problems if they're the ones treating you. </p>
<p>With your.last paragraph you basically say it doesn't matter what data you will see, you're closing your eyes and trusting your bumfuck Alabama friends more. I just hope your very smart friends can operate a ventilator and wont just continue to cause you many health problems. Good thing you're on the internet, which means you aren't real though (according to your earlier comment), or it'd be pretty depressing.</p>

<p>Reusing the same mask over and over is actually worse than no mask at all. Which is what 99% of people do. 
But in general, no, masks really dont do a thing against viral respiratory infections. The particles are too small, its like throwing sand against a chain link fence. The only time wearing a mask makes sense is if you are genuinely sick and coughing/sneezing. Then it may help a bit. But theres literally no reason healthy people need to wear one.</p>
<p>Its genuinely retarded when you think about it - you wear your mask into a restaurant - sit at a table and take off your mask placing it on the table - when leaving you put your mask back on.</p>

        <p>It's really just basic stuff. Inside the mask has a humid and somewhat warm environment, making it the perfect place for the bacteria (and probably even germs) to grow (unless you change your mask every 10 minutes or so). </p>
<p>When that shit happens, your immune system slowly starts getting weaker, making it easier for you to get the rona. </p>
<p>I know 4 people around me who got it, and I'm sure 3 of them were as pro mask as they could possibly get.</p>

        <p>&rt;You mean, those of them who go against widely accepted science and confirm your biases with no evidence? Those ones?</p>
<p>LMAO. Funny you say that because those people have actually provided much more solid info and better explanations than the Fauci gang </p>
<p>&rt;And saying that mask-conscious people can get infected when the ignorant assholes they have to spend time with because they're family is somehow proving your point?</p>
<p>You see, here's the thing with you fucking morons. If you worthless idiots are getting the virus from those of us who don't wear masks, then why don't we have it worse than you whinny fags even when we get the virus? </p>
<p>The vast majority of pro maskers around me got the virus. On the other hand anti maskers like me have been doing just fine. Did I pass it to them? If yes then why I don't even have any of the symptoms? Then why am I not getting sick? </p>
<p>Stop bitching about us ffs. The root of the problem is something else </p>
<p>&rt;It's a shame you're so afraid of a piece of cloth.</p>
<p>Nobody's afraid of masks pal. Pointing out their lack of efficiency is not the same as being afraid of them. Not everyone is massive pussy like you</p>

<p>It's precisely because of shit like this that I believe the covidians and pro maskers have no idea how masks even work. </p>
<p>Newsflash buddy: upon wearing a mask, within only 20 minutes, bacterias and germs start reproducing in an incredibly high speed, which WILL result in your immune system getting weaker. Now if you want to prevent that you should either stop wearing masks altogether, or change your mask every 10 minutes and wash your face every time you do it. </p>
<p>&rt;Because there are no other ways of getting covid, right boss.</p>
<p>Yea well the way you people are putting 99% of your energy on defending masks and how effective they are, one would thought that there's no other way to get the virus</p>

        <p>What? No no no buddy, you absolutely don't get to play that card. You know nothing about science or how the scientific process even works. If you did, you would've know that the science is based on skepticism, not trust. And if you knew you wouldn't play that "y'all immature" card, simply because we're questioning the data. Leave the "I love science" game for people who the game actually suits them because it definitely doesn't suit you.</p>

        <p>Scientific skepticism is still based on science. Scientists don't just come up to other scientists saying "You're wrong!" with no proof, no data, just a dumb meme that makes no sense, and insults. When scientists question the data, they review the data itself, how it was compiled, and if they find issues, they attempt to collect data in an improved way while documenting the process.</p>
<p>Scientific skepticism is not sitting on the toilet and saying "you're wrong, lol" with no evidence or research done.</p>

The vast majority of pro masker people around me ended up having the covid but the ones who didn't wear masks ended up being just fine, including myself. You smooth brain fuckheaded excuse of a talking walking monkey aren't anywhere close to being as smart as you think you are and I don't give two shits about whether you will get the covid or not. I'd say I wish you get the covid but unfortunately since you have 99.97% chance of surviving it, I won't.

<p>Until then, why not have a look at places where the virus (by no means even close to being the deadliest by the way, idiots) isn’t killing hundreds of thousands of people. </p>
<p>Nobody has said, recently, that wearing a mask stops you from getting COVID. What they’ve said, over and over and over because selfish fucking wankers like you lot don’t fucking listen, is that wearing a mask reduces your chance of <em>spreading</em> the damn thing. And what makes it better still is that the people you meet also wear a mask… and to make it even less likely you also  keep socially distant. </p>
<p>It shouldn’t be too hard - but because your personal freedom is more important, you can’t be bothered. Well fuck you. Read about any of the number of dipshit deniers who have caught COVID and Darwinned themselves.</p>

        <p>Yes, you will spread it because masks aren't 100% effective. I've already had covid, asymptomatic, and I'm thus immunized. But don't worry, responsible, unselfish people like you will be wearing their masks even after the fifth shot, so you needn't worry!</p>
<p>I don't think you're a sheep for wearing the mask. (the people of my country have been wearing them for more than a year! We were among the top 10 with the most cases!). You're a sheep only if you don't see how this is slowly turning into a neverending crisis/opportunity for totalitarianism</p>

<p>If we lived in a world with more people like you, you'd be forced to "trust" whoever the government tells you. Fortunately, there are enough people like me who respect your right to follow your own conscience and trust whoever you deem worthy. You don't want us around and chances are we won't like you either, so because we live in mostly-free societies, we can choose.</p>

        <p>&rt;What they’ve said, over and over and over because selfish fucking wankers like you lot don’t fucking listen, is that wearing a mask reduces your chance of spreading the damn thing.</p>
<p>And that's a lie. Either the virus is spread by large respiratory droplets - when you cough and sneeze - or it's an aerosol you let out when you breathe. If it's the former, then people who aren't coughing and sneezing don't need to wear masks. If it's the latter, then your cotton mask is useless and there's no point to it.</p>
<p>Masks are 100% hygiene theater.</p>

<p>&rt;Why do you think people are lying?!</p>
<p>Plenty of reasons. Most recently, a CNN technical director was caught on video talking about why they push COVID coverage so much and how they want the death toll to be higher to prove their point. The CEO of CNN's parent company said several weeks ago that the pandemic was "really good for ratings." The World Economic Forum is promoting "<a href="https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-great-reset">the Great Reset</a>" where they want to use the pandemic to further their economic agenda. In May of 2020, in a press conference, Nancy Pelosi called the pandemic "an opportunity" and said "every crisis is" one. There's not some unified conspiracy causing people to lie and perpetuate the lockdown measures, but everyone who is pushing it has an agenda.</p>

<p>No I will not receive the damn vaccine because I won't inject myself with an experimental vaccine for a disease that I have a 99.97% rate of survival. If you're so scared of it, you're more than welcome to turn yourself into a bloody rat lab and eventually face the consequences, however I will not be succumbing to your level. </p>
<p>No I will not wear a mask either because no matter how the hell you look at it, they don't offer any amount of enough protection against covid you fucking idiot. Hell, the argument you covid fans use for vaccine and it's 95% efficiency proves how fucking useless the masks were but you morons are too fucking self unaware to see that</p>

        <p>It’s pretty easy to prove it works with a little bit of critical thinking. Take a mask, put it on, and blow at your hand. Now, pull the mask down and blow again. Notice the difference? Air is mostly Nitrogen and Oxygen, which both are two atom molecules. Despite this, the mask makes a noticeable difference. Now think about the coronavirus. It is larger than 2 atoms. It contains millions of atoms. But yes. Tell me how the mask which makes a difference with two atoms does fuck all to millions.</p>

        <p>A loose fitting mask has a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20069567v2.full.pdf">30-60%</a> particle removal efficacy, compared to 95% for N95 rated ones. (The "95" of "N95" stands for 95%)</p>

        <p>it doesn't matter whether masks work IN THEORY.  we now have a year's worth of data across the country with Florida essentially being the control group, as they have had one of the lowest rates of mask compliance. The results are in: Masks have done very little to curb the spread of covid19. I bet you couldn't pick Florida's daily case graph from the other 49 states.  If mask mandates worked than the states like CA and NY would not have seen that fall wave.  people were masking up around here for the entire time, even outdoors.</p>

        <p>The US isn't the only place on earth. The numbers are very clear, in countries where preventive measured were followed, they have had fewer infections, fewer deaths.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the environment you're in is also important. Masks aren't the <em>only</em> thing to look at. The average age of the population is a big factor, older people not only die in greater proportions, but they also catch it more, places with warmer climates tend to have fewer infections because people are outside more, and open the windows more, which induces a greater airflow when indoors and reduces the risks, the general health of a population has a big impact, the presence of universal healthcare in a society has behavioural impacts on a number of variables, the proximity of people, in larger states where population density is smaller, people tend to be farther apart on average (definitely not the case in CA or NY), the average income is a big factor too, richer people/country have a better access to healthcare, and it's usually better quality healthcare, etc.</p>
<p>The idea was never to bring the numbers down to zero, it was to lower them as much as possible. From a public health perspective, saving one person is a gain, but politicians have to weigh the prejudices on the rest of the population.</p>
<p>What you're preaching is basically like saying "let's slay 1% of our population to improve the chances for the rest of us". Reducing the population by X% can improve a lot of things, more clean water per capita, less trafic, more food, etc., and if you choose that 1% by a number of factors, like who has a greater chance of making the rest of the population's life harder, then you may actually be able to make significant improvements. But that kind of rhetoric is fucked up, as you were probably just thinking lol This is why, although killing 1% of the population could be very useful, it's <em>never</em> considered.</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>
<p>Because although this isn't how it's formulated, saying that people with preexisting conditions "would've died anyway" is making a choice that these people matter <em>less</em> than you. Someone with diabetes could live up to 100yo, but you choose to say that their life doesn't matter enough to you, so you may cause their death at 30, 40, 50 yo, and rob them of the remainder of their lives because you don't like to be burdened.</p>

        <p>That's from the same author, Baruch Vainshelboim.</p>
<p>He's also the only one to say this.</p>
<p>Now, of course, you should avoid impeding your breathing with a mask in normal circumstances. Nobody says you can breathe <em>the same</em> with a mask and without a mask, that would be fucking stupid.</p>
<p>But I'm sure you realize that many circumstances can warrant wearing a mask, just like this post so aptly underlines.</p>
<p>And given the difference in nature between the many potential threats to your health, it only makes sense that different masks would be needed to address the different threats.</p>
<p>You could always wear the mask that is the bulkiest and most difficult to breathe with to improve your chances of never inhaling anything dangerous, but most people would rather strike a more comfortable balance between safety and efficacy. </p>
<p>If a given mask is less of a burden, but good enough to prevent most problems, then people tend to go with that. A lot of people have been using N95s, because they're the easiest to procure and the least burdensome for the most protection.</p>

<p>You also seemed to have cherry pick some of the stuff he said and skipped the actual conclusion at the end:</p>
<p>&rt;The data suggest that both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of facemasks.</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>&rt;Long-term consequences of wearing facemask can cause health deterioration, developing and progression of chronic diseases and premature death. Governments, policy makers and health organizations should utilize prosper and scientific evidence-based approach with respect to wearing facemasks, when the latter is considered as preventive intervention for public health.</p>
<p>So basicly if you below 70 and have only, being generious here, 1% chance of dying it is not worth the other variety of health risks and damage. Just like it is with taking experimental vaccines. Car accidents are more likely to kill me than this virus.</p>

<p>The whole heart of the scientific method is that you try to <em>disprove</em> your hypothesis and this researcher even failed to do that which really calls into questions this researchers credibility. This article doesn't prove shit - at best it poses questions for further research which would be fine if that's what the researcher were to conclude; however, if this researchers wants to prove that his hypothesis is correct, he needs to conduct an experiment.

<p><em>If</em> that were true, then yes, you're right, but of course, it's not lol The main issue is behavioural; ie not wearing the mask properly, not wearing it all the time, touching your eyes, not washing your hands, etc. The mask itself works, but poor hygiene and adherence to other safety measures is what brings its efficacy down. When not wearing a mask, the most common infection vector is respiratory, and when wearing it, it becomes another factor.</p>
<p>&rt;The data suggest that both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of facemasks.</p>
<p>It's a very flawed study, from a lone researcher who hasn't been peer reviewed, published in a bullshit "scientific" journal. It has no credibility. Whatever it says isn't relevant lol</p>
<p>&rt;So basicly if you below 70 and have only, being generious here, 1% chance of dying it is not worth the other variety of health risks and damage. Just like it is with taking experimental vaccines. Car accidents are more likely to kill me than this virus.</p>
<p>That could've been partially true without variants, but the death rate you're reporting here is based on the current number of deaths/infections (and it's false, because it's around 97%), which is wrong for a number of reasons I listed in another comment you can look up in my history.</p>
<p>As for the vaccines, they're not "experimental", not any more than any other treatment on the market. They went through the full approval process, despite Trump's efforts.</p>
<p>&rt;So your welcome to do what you want but don't sit there and think anyone has the right to force me I have to wear one without hard proof it would actually work. My body my choice!</p>
<p>I provided you with hard proof it works, you just chose to disregard it, and to use a single study that was thoroughly discredited to comfort your opinion. As for being "forced", you're wrong about that lol Try to cross the border without a mask mate, the rest of the world doesn't live in fantasy land like you do. </p>
<p>As for "your body your choice", this would be a great idea <em>if</em> you had zero chances of infecting other people by being reckless. Given that your poor choice has a very real impact on a lot of people around you, this goes beyond "your" body.</p>

        <p>&rt;<em>If</em> that were true, then yes, you're right, but of course, it's not lol The main issue is behavioural; ie not wearing the mask properly, not wearing it all the time, touching your eyes, not washing your hands, etc. The mask itself works, but poor hygiene and adherence to other safety measures is what brings its efficacy down. When not wearing a mask, the most common infection vector is respiratory, and when wearing it, it becomes another factor.</p>
<p>So the good old communist argument eh. "They just didn't do it right! But in thoery it works!" Sorry buddy this is the real world. You need to make policies that work for the people not theories you think should work. Also did you read the medical studies attached to the article? This has been tried in hospitals and same effect shown. Try again.</p>
<p>&rt;It's a very flawed study, from a lone researcher who hasn't been peer reviewed, published in a bullshit "scientific" journal. It has no credibility. Whatever it says isn't relevant lol</p>
<p>Lol what you linked wasn't peer reviewed either so I guess your argument is completely defeated by your own words here. I love how you people sit there and scream "No my version of science is right!!"</p>
<p>&rt;That could've been partially true without variants, but the death rate you're reporting here is based on the current number of deaths/infections (and it's false, because it's around 97%), which is wrong for a number of reasons I listed in another comment you can look up in my history.</p>
<p>Well the deaths themselves are lower then stated around the world since a lot of countries changed how they report what killed them to inflate covid numbers. Something that wasn't done before this virus so my 1% was generous and your 3% is laughable.</p>
<p>&rt;As for the vaccines, they're not "experimental", not any more than any other treatment on the market. They went through the full approval process, despite Trump's efforts.</p>
<p>Lol what?? Sigh the propaganda has got a hold on you. Please show me where they have been tested long term and approved? Hint, you can't.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;So your welcome to do what you want but don't sit there and think anyone has the right to force me I have to wear one without hard proof it would actually work. My body my choice!
&rt;
&rt;I provided you with hard proof it works, you just chose to disregard it, and to use a single study that was thoroughly discredited to comfort your opinion. As for being "forced", you're wrong about that lol Try to cross the border without a mask mate, the rest of the world doesn't live in fantasy land like you do. </p>
<p>Once again by your words your "proof" isn't peer reviewed thus worthless. Also most studies done during this are heavily biased so I prefer to use ones from pre political covid. Also what you link showed that unless its n95 masks the others that were tested allowed more than enough particles through to all infection rendering them useless.</p>
<p>&rt;As for "your body your choice", this would be a great idea <em>if</em> you had zero chances of infecting other people by being reckless. Given that your poor choice has a very real impact on a lot of people around you, this goes beyond "your" body.</p>
<p>This argument is useless as well. It is just an emotional response from fabricated fear. </p>
<p>A person could kill me by driving, so can we just ban all cars? Some one cutting wood in their yard and producing saw dust can dift to my yard, I inhale it and could(very small chance mind you like covid ;) ) get cancer and die due to my cells damaged in my lungs from foreign objects.</p>
<p>So many things in life that people do go beyond our bodies but if you and the other doomers what to go down this road then OK. I want a ban on everything that might chase me harm from other people as well as barcodes on everyone with all of their life history to date to be able to evaluate them as a threat. Since all of this has a greater than zero chance to affect me. We would have to return to just living natural. Nothing produce by our hands, naked and running around a forest eating berries to live you way with shorter life spans!!</p>
<p>See how ridiculous your position is yet? Everything we do as human carries a risk, the question is this worth it?? Most the research , numbers, and critical thinking say no, but politicians say yes to get votes. </p>
<p>Risk vs reward is a good concept to learn.</p>
<p>Also here more mask studies for you to ignore and say aren't real since its against your beliefs.</p>

        <p>The fabric circle in front of the mic stops the sound of plosive consonants like "b" and "p" from producing a pop in the recording. The pop filter evenly disperses the breath from those sounds across the surface of the mic, eliminating the pop. It doesn't stop the breath, otherwise the sound would be muted.</p>

        <p>What you lose: the ability to read someone's facial expressions.  The inability to see someone's smile.  You may not realize it but that does have a negative impact on your brain subconsciously.  seeing everyone with covered faces dehumanizes us.  Think about it for a second:  when you see someone smile at you, how does it make you feel?  happy? well now cover that person's face with a piece of cloth. t's probably why people have been so snappy at each other lately.</p>
<p>two weeks of this would have been fine but this is over a year now.</p>
<p>Small Children are affected much more negatively because they need to see faces in order to learn to speak and form words, they need to see faces to develop emotionally.</p>
<p>also, 30-60 minutes a day? in New York you have to wear them inside all public spaces.  When you are working in said public spaces, thats 8+ hours.</p>

        <p>Back in 2019, this kind of response to mental health was considered insensitive or ignorant. Just because YOU feel the mask is not negatively impacting your mental or physical health beyond being "a bit uncomfortable" does not mean everyone is having the same experience.</p>
<p>Also, this is an assumption, I admit, but that you would say it is only 30-60 minutes a day leads me to believe that you have the privilege of working from home or something. Personally, I have to wear the thing 9 hours a day just for work which would not include anything I need to do after work like getting groceries.</p>

        <p>Except methane gas is odorless, the smelly components in farts are mainly hydrogen sulfide, methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide.<br>
Oh, and only one third of people have methane-generating flora.  </p>
<p>The argument still holds, though. Those molecules are less than 4 Angström in size. Coronavirus is about 125 nm in size so Coronavirus is roughly 312 times larger than the  smelly components of a fart.   </p>

        <p>While this is correct, the water droplets in condensed breath should be smaller in size than mucus droplets. <br>
However, if a mask successfully redirect the flow of this condensed breath, like for example, right on my f*cking glasses (this winter was annoying), then it's a strong evidence that masks are effective at redirecting airflow.   </p>
<p>It could be a great way to differentiate between proper facemasks meant to do exactly this, and cheap pieces of face cloth some put on just because they have to.</p>

        <p>January 2021 Stanford Mask Study - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720333028</p>
<p>“Although, scientific evidence supporting facemasks’ efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established. Is has been hypothesized that facemasks have compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use. The current article comprehensively summarizes scientific evidences with respect to wearing facemasks in the COVID-19 era, providing proper information for public health and decisions making.”</p>
<p>“Although several countries mandated wearing facemask in health care settings and public areas, scientific evidences are lacking supporting their efficacy for reducing morbidity or mortality associated with infectious or viral diseases [2], [14], [19]. Therefore, it has been hypothesized: 1) the practice of wearing facemasks has compromised safety and efficacy profile, 2) Both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to reduce human-to-human transmission and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, 3) Wearing facemasks has adverse physiological and psychological effects, 4) Long-term consequences of wearing facemasks on health are detrimental.”</p>

        <p>This isn't a study, it is a hypothesis, which by definition is a proposition "made on the basis of limited evidence, without any assumption of its truth."  Not only is it not a study, you will not find Stanford University referenced anywhere in this hypothesis.   ScienceDirect as well as Elsevier which supports Science Direct, also has a vast number of studies, papers, etc., that contradict the summary of this one hypothesis.  So it appears you yourself "cherry picked" the conclusions of this writing, attached a false title to suggest a misleading body of work by a credible source.  Just my opinion but if one has to lie and misrepresent to make a point, perhaps that point is invalid.</p>

        <p>The problem is that this isn't a study, it's a review by a single person, who isn't an infectious disease expert, cherry picking studies and not looking at the whole picture.</p>
<p>Also its full of inaccuracies</p>
<p>&rt;Due to the difference in sizes between SARS-CoV-2 diameter and facemasks thread diameter (the virus is 1000 times smaller), SARS-CoV-2 can easily pass through any facemask</p>
<p>This isn't how viruses spread, they are contained in liquid dropets, which can be stopped by a surgical face mask</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23505369/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23505369/</a></p>
<p>&rt;We collected samples of exhaled particles (one with and one without a facemask) in two size fractions ("coarse"&rt;5 µm, "fine"≤5 µm) from 37 volunteers within 5 days of seasonal influenza onset, measured viral copy number using quantitative RT-PCR, and tested the fine-particle fraction for culturable virus. Fine particles contained 8.8 (95% CI 4.1 to 19) fold more viral copies than did coarse particles. <strong>Surgical masks reduced viral copy numbers in the fine fraction by 2.8 fold (95% CI 1.5 to 5.2) and in the coarse fraction by 25 fold (95% CI 3.5 to 180). Overall, masks produced a 3.4 fold (95% CI 1.8 to 6.3) reduction in viral aerosol shedding.</strong></p>
<p>Also the author says 99% of covid cases are asymptomatic, without a source.</p>
<p>Then they use a single meta-analysis to argue that masks don't work and attack it's methods, but there have been many papers and meta analyses of the efficacy of face masks. For example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(20)31043-9/fulltext">https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(20)31043-9/fulltext</a></p>
<p>&rt;In general, wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection</p>
<p><a href="https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40001-020-00475-6">https://eurjmedres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40001-020-00475-6</a></p>
<p>&rt;The result of this meta-analysis has shown significant reduction in infection with face mask use</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7253999/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7253999/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect</p>
<p>This is a pretty low effort review without much substance, only looking at a small subsection of the research, which doesn't even agree with the author, they're just disputing it.</p>

        <p>The problem with this is that you are infectious before symptom onset, and high viral shedding is present very early on in disease progression, before you may even suspect that your symptoms are signs of illness.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30172-5/fulltext">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30172-5/fulltext</a></p>
<p>&rt;Several studies report viral load peaks during the prodromal phase of illness or at the time of symptom onset. Providing a rationale for the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2. This finding is supported by the observation in contact-tracing studies that the highest risk of transmission occurs very early in the disease course (<strong>a few days before and within the first 5 days after symptom onset</strong>)</p>
<p>This meta-analysis also comments on the dymanics of asymptomatic spread</p>
<p>&rt;Several studies reported <strong>similar viral loads at the start of infection among asymptomatic and symptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2</strong>; however, most studies demonstrated faster viral clearance in asymptomatic individuals, as also seen in MERS-CoV, suggesting a shorter infectious period but with <strong>similar potential transmissibility at the onset of infection.</strong></p>
<p>With the caveat that the rate of asymptomatic carriers is much lower than initial estimates, which is also seen in this meta-analysis.</p>
<p>People cough and sneeze all the time without suspecting an underlying infection. You may not even realise you are developing symptoms of covid because they will progress from mild to more severe over the course of a few days.</p>
<p>This analysis makes the point that because the peak of viral shedding is very early in the disease progression, rapid identification of the infection is crucial. Which means it doesn't make sense to wait until you're sure you have the disease, because then it's probably too late. Probably a better idea just to wear a mask when you go inside somewhere, distance, and wash your hands.</p>

        <p>The author also claims that:</p>
<p>&rt; It fact, the current standard of care practice for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is breathing 100% oxygen <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720333028#b0080">[16]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720333028#b0085">[17]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720333028#b0090">[18]</a>. </p>
<p>This claim is wrong. If you fouled breath 100% oxygen you would get oxygen poisoning.</p>
<p><a href="https://myhealth.ucsd.edu/RelatedItems/3,90904#:~:text=Oxygen%20toxicity%20is%20lung%20damage,it%20can%20even%20cause%20death">https://myhealth.ucsd.edu/RelatedItems/3,90904#:\~:text=Oxygen%20toxicity%20is%20lung%20damage,it%20can%20even%20cause%20death</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;Oxygen toxicity is lung damage that happens from breathing in too much extra (supplemental) oxygen. It’s also called oxygen poisoning. It can cause coughing and trouble breathing. In severe cases it can even cause death. </p>

        <p>It's also typical national big box stores' policies to not enforce mask mandates. It's all about appearing safe for the gullible portion of the public (and placating legislators), not actually stopping the spread within ~~15~~ 500 days.</p>

        <p>The whole “droplets” thing was some of the worst BS ever. We’re talking about aerosols. They can travel miles on the wind. Masks were a crowd control measure from day 1. Give the idiots something to do to think they’re safe, and laugh at them from afar. The social contract is fucking kindling.</p>

        <p>Doc here. Never had my entire ICU die 3 times over in a month from the flu. The scale of this is way bigger than even a moderate/bad pandemic flu season. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The average number of patients I would lose in the ICU during the month of January has been 4 for the last several years. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This past January it was 55. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's not comparable to the flu except in the respect that both are respiratory viruses. This virus has stretched US hospital systems to their breaking points. India is having a similar situation to our last winter right now.</p>

        <p>The three other masks are to stop you from breathing things in such as coal, asbestos, or paint) that is why they are more complex, they must be completely airtight and have a filter and valve system to only let clean air in; The idea behind these masks is completely filtering the air that comes in. Covid masks on the other hand are simpler in design because there is no valve system, and they do not have to be airtight. In a covid mask the entire mask is one big filter, water droplets containing the virus get trapped in the fibers of the mask. This does let some particles escape though (some particles escape out the sides for example). The idea behind a covid mask is to reduce the amount of covid containing water droplets / particulate in the air, not negate them entirely. This is also why masks that doctors working with people who are sick with covid are more complex. These masks must filter out more covid containing particles to better keep the doctors safe. The reason not everyone has these more complicated masks is because they are harder to manufacture. The masks are being given to doctors and medical professionals who need them the most instead of being given to the general public. I just did some basic research for this comment, feel free to reply with anything you thing that I am incorrect about.</p>

        <p>The masks aren't supposed to make you immune, they just limit the spread, if everyone wanted to be immune they would use a gas mask with filters but #1 thats expensive #2 the companies making them couldn't get enough #3 shipping alone would cost millions</p>

        <p>Covid virus particles, and most other viruses, are bigger compared to molecules, which is a proven fact. The smaller a particle is, the harder it is to stop it in a portable way. Face masks do have holes big enough for oxygen, but small enough to prevent these viruses. Imagine it like your nose, air can flow through, but its very hard for objects bigger than a inch to fit through. Also, face masks are easy to manufacture and implement, so having everyone wear one is a good way to prevent spread. Yes, face masks are not perfect, but nothing, not even the gods are perfect. Also, COVID-19 is not the most dangerous virus, that goes to bacteriophages which almost perfectly kill a specific type of bacteria, and are harmless to humans, like caffeine.</p>

        <p>Stop fucking saying this is the deadliest virus in history thats absolute falsehood, you’re making it seem like a mask won’t work when it will. Deadliest virus in history is probably something like smallpox or influenza. Also when working with spray paint or mining or working with asbestos those things can absolutely saturate the air when a virus normally can’t. This comparison just shows a lack of understanding on your part.</p>

        <p>For the first. I would goes that you mean covid-19 beacus of this sub. But the deadliest virus in history would go to the spansih flu. And the other mask is to stop you from breathing in the   bad chemicals/dust and the mask down to the right is to stop you from spreding the virus.</p>

        <p>A. It isnt the deadliest.
B. Its stupid making this comparison because... The goverment wont or doesnt want to spend more millions/billions on distributing more complex masks.
C. That mask is outdated in a lot of countriea FFP2 here.
D. The masks work if you use the correctly so no need to distribute those expensive ones because people dont cover their nose or just... Wear it wrong or not at all.</p>

        <p>Ok so if you actually think for half a second about this.</p>
<p>Literally no one has called this the most deadly virus ever so you're already off to a bad start. </p>
<p>\&rt;TWEET OF SOMEONE SAYING ITS SUPER DEADDYY!</p>
<p>Alright, they're dumb. Moving on. </p>
<p>The amount of paint in the air, the amount of smoke in the air, and the amount of coal dust in the air is going to be way fucking higher than water droplets...if you take a second to use your big boi galaxy brains you would realize that the human body doesn't fill a room up with visible, dense pockets of spit after 1 minute of breathing. </p>
<p>There are exponentially more particles from those things in the air and they're made up of heavy chemicals, carcinogens, and metals. Are you not aware that those things are...bad?</p>
<p>If a single bit of asbestos gets into your lungs, that's it. Its there forever. Your body cant clean that out, your immune system can't remove it so you have to be absolutely, 100% sure that literally zero asbestos particles are getting in. Because the issue with asbestos is that its literally a micro-splinter that never goes away. That's gonna be a bad time when you have a few thousand of them and no way to prevent them from cutting you up. </p>
<p>\&rt;"ThEn WhY WoUlDnT YoU wAnT THat fRO tEH DEaDLEE ViRus?!? Why LET ONE VIRUS IN IF YOU COULD PREVEEENT IT?!?!"</p>
<p>Masks are designed to absorb water particulate. Which is how a this virus travels. You don't need, nor is it economically viable, to go out and get a $220 set of masks when you could just...wash your hands. And wear an absorbent, cost effective mask while maintaining a distance.</p>
<p>A viral load has to be reach for a disease to actually take root. If a few Covid viruses get in...you prob wont get infected anyway. It takes a large 'dose' of it to actually let the disease live long enough to not get killed off by the immune system. </p>
<p>\&rt;"STUDIES SHOW THAT MASK DON-"</p>
<p>Those studies show that mask don't work when morons don't wear them right, don't wash their hands and don't change their masks more than a few times a week. And you know this. You've been told this a dozen times. But they agree with you when used out of context and you get to act like the smartest man in the room. </p>
<p>\&rt;WOW STRAW MAN. DOWN VOTE! DOWN VOTE.</p>
<p>If you can point out something that I got wrong, Ill address and and accept your downvote. Otherwise you're proving you don't want to understand things, you want to be right and will actively ignore facts to...be right. </p>
<p>Which would make you an NPC sheep. </p>
<p>You absolute doomers.</p>

        <p>I’ll probably get down voted for using logic but a mask is meant to protect others and the others for yourself and the virus travels in spit droplets so if you cough the mask would get the spit droplets not the air.</p>

        <p>Beeeeecause those first 3 masks filter out toxic particles already in the air, so you don't breathe them <strong><em>in</em></strong></p>
<p>The last mask filters potentially infected water droplets from your lungs as you breathe <strong><em>out</em></strong></p>
<p>It's not that hard to understand</p>

        <p>Hmmm. It seems most of those masks are for specific jobs that are specialists. The covid one is like that because it's affordable the the every day person.  You could buy one of those other masks if you found one and could afford one</p>

        <p>Wow, so you are comparing situations where people are in constant, direct contact with large amounts of harmful particals, particularly people that work in those professions for a living, with situations where people only come across -possible- spreaders who themselves should have enough braincells to take similar precautions? One is unavoidable and necessary (painters, miners, asbestos removers) and the other is very much avoidable. Doctors in hospitals also use better masks if the risk of contamination is higher. But keep this ignorance up and people will surely start to need full body contamination protection suits just to avoid getting affected from all the dumbasses that won’t just wear a mask now.</p>

        <p>Fair, but unless you are currently rocking over 100 years of age, then those principles that we were taught as kids don't apply to full-blown pandemics. If we could take care of ourselves as a nation, we wouldn't need to be reminded why masks are important during a pandemic. If we gave a s*** about the person sitting next to us and their life, then again, we wouldn't need this reminder.  </p>
<p>Do I believe that a good portion of certain individuals in this country could take care of themselves and others, sure! However, since so many people show disdain and an apathetic view for those around them, then, yeah, no... You need look no further than the GOP morons swearing up and down how "cOvId IsN't DaNgErOuS..." They are either dead or singing a different tune these days. Trump doesn't count. As when you pump an individual full of over a hundred thousand dollars of free socialized (EEEEK, play dead!) medicine and drugs, not to mention experimental treatments that a normal individual wouldn't receive, you cannot compare the outcomes.</p>

Florida hasn't had a mask mandate in almost a year and they're the 2nd oldest state. Why aren't they 2nd or 1st in most deaths or infections? Even if you look at the statistics per capita <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/new-mexico-covid-cases.html">New Mexico</a> which is also a masked state is being hurt more than Florida?

        <p>First of all, mask mandates are merely that, mandates. No one is going to force you to wear one unless you are in a business or public place that requires the use of a face mask and even then it is (please put a mask on or shop from home, online, etc.)  </p>
<p>Of the reported cases, how many morons caught covid-19 because they flaunted their apathetic views of others and just said "f*** you, I am not wearing that." Next thing you know they end up like that little weasel from NJ who almost died from Covid-19.  </p>
<p>Second, I don't believe the nation's crotch rot of a state, that sent cops to arrest scientists who were trying to release the real death and infection rates in the state is a good baseline to use... With GOP leadership in charge, you are more apt. to have misleading data that "shows promising results" so that mask mandates and such can be lifted early. The next thing you see is what happened in Texas or Florida; death, rates, surge! It is happening all over this country, mask mandate or otherwise, as people; just, don't, care...</p>
<p>I understand where you are coming from and see how this can be annoying. I don't like being told "what is best for me" or "what I should be doing" either; nobody does, as it is annoying and makes you feel like you are being treated like a child. However, that never, ever, ever warranted death threats to scientists, appointed members of government, plans to kidnap or execute State governors.</p>
<p>Personally, I plan on keeping my mask on for as long as I can, because seriously why not. It hides your face, you can use it like a freaking feedbag for food, I can mouth "f*** you" at anyone, and generally just love it! I don't see why others don't, but hey, we are all slightly different.</p>

        <p>Spray paint is far heavier, and can get in your eyes and what not, mining involves many dangerous tools, if dirt hits you it can potentially do a TON of damage. Idk what asbestos is but I’m pretty sure it has to do with chemicals and what not that can irritate your skin and eyes and what not. corona virus isn’t gonna blind you, and bcuz it’s he deadliest virus they’re not gonna make big expensive harder to breathe in masks mandatory. And before you say “the rich aren’t wearing big masks” it’s cuz they don’t have to.</p>

        <p>Because it's more comfortable than a big mask and it's still pretty effective. Also, the paper mask is against spreading the virus and all other masks are against getting the virus, so they need more isolation ._.</p>

        <p>"really effective"</p>
<p>January 2021 Stanford Mask Study - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720333028</p>
<p>“Although, scientific evidence supporting facemasks’ efficacy is lacking, adverse physiological, psychological and health effects are established. Is has been hypothesized that facemasks have compromised safety and efficacy profile and should be avoided from use. The current article comprehensively summarizes scientific evidences with respect to wearing facemasks in the COVID-19 era, providing proper information for public health and decisions making.”</p>
<p>“Although several countries mandated wearing facemask in health care settings and public areas, scientific evidences are lacking supporting their efficacy for reducing morbidity or mortality associated with infectious or viral diseases [2], [14], [19]. Therefore, it has been hypothesized: 1) the practice of wearing facemasks has compromised safety and efficacy profile, 2) Both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to reduce human-to-human transmission and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, 3) Wearing facemasks has adverse physiological and psychological effects, 4) Long-term consequences of wearing facemasks on health are detrimental.”</p>

        <p>The mask isn't for preventing you from getting sick dipshit. It to stop you from spreading it. Like y'all post shit like this without even thinking and it's actually kinda depressing seeing so many brain dead people.</p>
<p>Obviously y'all make up less than 1% of the population and no one gives a fuck about you, but just realize that the majority of the people in the planet are happy to put a fucking cloth over their face if it has the slightest chance of not getting someone else sick.</p>

        <p>What kinda sucks as well is that it almost has 60k subs. Now I really don't give af about their weird ass conspiracy theories since I find them entertaining, but I draw the line when they actively support decisions and suggest things that can get others sick or hurt. My grandma died from complications with covid, and that shit wasn't fun to go through. This sickness has literally killed people and it's frustrating the amount of people who aren't taking it even SLIGHTLY seriously.</p>
<p>Also I love the theory on here when people say covid isn't real since this subs main goal is that they don't like how covid took over the media and how it's portrayed in such a big way. So even the people on this sub don't know what they are posting too.</p>
