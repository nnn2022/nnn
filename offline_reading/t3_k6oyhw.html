    <strong>Videos from Corona hotels shows many have mild symptoms</strong>
    <p><p>Often young people goes to Corona hotels, in my country Norway, because of they don't want to infect elderly and chronically ill. They gets free rooms, food etc. there provided by the government. Some young people documents their lives inside the hotels and makes TikTok videos there. It just shows that many of them have very mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. They live "normally" in an area. There's one hotel room and bathroom for each person, and a big room where everyone can meet and socialize. Since everyone are infected, they don't worry about getting infected. They hugs, parties etc. Coronavirus isn't dangerous for young and healthy people.</p>

        <p>This is the kind of common sense thing that we probably should have been doing from the start. This is the definition of quarantine- separating sick people from susceptible people for a limited amount of time. We had a whole lot of unused hotel rooms for many months. You could keep hotel employees employed at the same time. :)</p>
<p>Problem is in America, I think all these hotels would be completely destroyed in a matter of a few weeks. Thoughts?</p>

        <p>Interesting stuff thank you for posting. My understanding is that all non-norweigians travelling to Norway are obligated to stay in the Corona hotel for 10 days and pay for that. Is that correct?</p>
<p>Also if a Norwegian travels back and they rent, rather than own property, they too must stay on the Corona hotel. Is that also true?</p>

        <p>&rt; Interesting stuff thank you for posting. My understanding is that all non-norweigians travelling to Norway are obligated to stay in the Corona hotel for 10 days and pay for that. Is that correct?</p>
<p>Yes, that's true. They've to stay on a quarantine hotel. A quarantine hotel and a corona hotel aren't the same. A quarantine hotel is mandatory for travelling people to stay in and you've to pay for it yourself, but a corona hotel are voluntarily for Norwegian citizens and is free. If citizens don't want to stay at home because of the fear of infecting elderly and vulnerable family members they lives with, they goes to the hotel.</p>
<p>&rt; Also if a Norwegian travels back and they rent, rather than own property, they too must stay on the Corona hotel. Is that also true?
Regardless what you're doing when travelling, you always have to stay in a quarantine hotel. People travelling to Norway has to stay 10 weeks on the hotel regardless of what they're planning to do on the trip. Even if you're going to be alone in a cabin in the mountain and skiing, you still have to quarantine.</p>
<p>The voluntarily hotels aren't a problem in my opinion. If people choose to be there instead of at home, it's their life and their choice. Mandatory hotels aren't sustainable long term though. Especially not for a virus with high survival chance economically speaking. We're dependent on workers from around the world. I think it's  important to share these videos to show everyone that the vast majority don't get severely ill or die. Many have very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, therefor they can live almost "normally" - but just locked inside because of isolation laws.</p>

        <p>Thank you again. I guess in the second instance I wanted to ask if Norwegians must stay in the quarantine hotel too. I did hear that they must if they rent property but if they own property then they can stay there should they choose.</p>
