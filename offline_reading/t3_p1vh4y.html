    <strong>I have to explain a few things.</strong>
    <p><p>Without the vaccine or masks, PRIVATE BUSINESSES can make you not go there. Places like Walmart and stuff have store policies. No one is forcing you. But also COVID is really painful and you can't do anything. It is worse than the flu pretty much. Even vaccinated people that get it is not fun. Vaccines build up your immune system naturally, and it can still transmit to other people and such. Like in some places you don't have to wearca mask if you get a vaccine, and you will probably forget the vaccine a year from now. But yeah, people aren't scared, but smart. In the 50s (or 60s or whatever) during the polio breakout the shutdown places and wore masks and got the vaccine when it came out. Now, is the disease forcing us home? No.</p></p>

        <p>I have to explain a few things:  With bans on certain individuals participating in commerce, PRIVATE BUSINESSES are going to quickly discover that their revenue will have dropped below a level tolerable to their major shareholders and board members.</p>
<p>They will then use the previously-conditioned platforms of looming inflation and possible shortages to increase prices substantially for their remaining customers to attempt to bridge their growing revenue gap created via their discriminatory practices.</p>
<p>The sheeple will continue to parrot whatever the television tells them to, and the media and government will continue to scapegoat people willing and capable of thinking for themselves.</p>
<p>But know full well: We see through your lies, and your gaslighting doesn't work on us.</p>
<p>Prevent us from going to your shops?  Congratulations, you just lost a significant portion of your customer base.</p>
<p>We do not forget.</p>
<p>We do not forgive.</p>

        <p>Vaccines build your immune system naturally? Where did you get your medical license? I got my first dose yesterday so not an anti vaxer here. I had covid with no symptoms. I have a few family members in poor health so if me adding to my immunity helps I will take it. Arm hurts. Hand was tingling. I felt better with real COVID. Iâ€™m no doctor. I donâ€™t give medical advice. But someone like TangyDrinks clearly should not be posting anything about vaccines. Ever.</p>
