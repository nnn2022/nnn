        <p>That's why it's so important to resist it in America, where it's still a guideline and not a law yet. </p>
<p>It'll be much harder after they make it a law and sentence you to jail for not wearing the muzzle.</p>

        <p>Like if I even saw a shred of decent evidence supporting their use in public settings, I would probably change my mind.</p>
<p>Until then, I consider masks virtue signaling nothing more. </p>
<p>Iâ€™m sticking to my conspiracy theory that they were just a ploy to get the scared Doomers out of their homes, so the economy didnâ€™t completely collapse. Also gave the governors a scapegoat. Win win for them. All they had to do was say they worked.</p>

        <p>The evidence for masks is so incredibly weak it blows my mind how obsessed people are with them. I have yet to see 1 convincing argument to justify their widespread usage. All the studies that people use to support mandates basically boil down to "they are better than nothing" and "they could be helpful". Its not weird that some people choose to wear them, it's insane that governments are mandating them, using "science" as their justification. </p>
<p>Your conspiracy theory is spot on. It is painfully obvious that all the lockdowns were disaster, and even the doomers deep down know it. But they went all in on covid being extremely dangerous, so they had to maintain that stance. They couldn't just do a 180. Lives were destroyed. Jobs were lost. Vacations, weddings, parties, events were canceled. Sports, movies, music, theater, were eliminated. Schools were shut down. Trillions of dollars were printed. The damage caused was so massive, they could never admit they overreacted. Masks are a simple act that anyone can do, that show that you are still "taking it seriously". And after all the big protests in May and June, masks became the "reason" why they were ok. So now they can still participate in society, but not have to admit that lockdowns were a mistake and they screwed up. And then politicians latched on to them. They are perfect. They can be seen to be taking it seriously and doing something, without really doing anything. And then they can shift the blame from themselves and onto the rule breaking others. Masks actually helping is completely illogical, but their use to make people who were wrong still feel like they are right, is genius.</p>
