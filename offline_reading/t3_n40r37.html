        <p>In my opinion, a trial towards ‘immunity passports’. Anyone who signed up to this little experiment, did not sign up to getting their freedoms back, they signed up to the introduction of these draconian measures which I believe come June 21st, will be required.</p>

        <p>Is this actually good news?  The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-56943652">story</a> is that they forced them to all be tested or they couldn't attend.</p>
<p>&rt; Prof Buchan says a key question the trial event needs to answer is: "With all of those measures in place, do people still enjoy themselves?"</p>
<p>Seems like they are asking if they've broken "young people" to mandatory testing for recreation.  Answer: yes.</p>
<p>As usual, this obviously isn't about the actual results or "safety" <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/15/what-is-lateral-flow-covid-test-how-accurate">because</a>:</p>
<p>&rt; In a leaked email seen by the Guardian, a senior government official warns that – at the current Covid levels – someone who tests positive with a lateral flow device in London has “at best a 25% chance” of it being a true positive. If the test is taken at home, that falls to as low as 10% or even 2%.</p>

        <p>This is just so they can blame events like this when their vaxx fails. They'll say it was all these people who partied or the ones who went on holiday,</p>
<p>It's obvious what's going on in  the UK rn. There's so much mixed messaging on purpose. Foreign travel to open up, countries to be added to the green list, Brits to be allowed in Europe if UK will take holiday makers from the continent etc.  OTOH, they're saying that MPs and scientists are warning that people should be discouraged from going on holiday abroad this year.  So which is it? The world is opening up, so book your Easy Jet, or cool your heels, your foreign holiday's going to start the next wave?</p>
<p>The media is doing  exactly the same double messaging. They run celebratory  stories about "not long now" and "countdown to freedom" and "what are you most looking forward to when we get out of jail?" and oooh,get a load of our post-lockdown fashion must-haves... Then they run articles right next door on their main page on what if there's a third wave, and about that new variant that's worrying the scientists.</p>
<p>You know by end of summer, they'l be saying "look at these irresponsible party-goers, holiday-makers, post-lockdown fashion shoppers, jail-breakers and freedom guzzlers who didn't care enough to keep it safe  for the sake of all the rest of us who have sacrificed so much".</p>
<p>It will be just like how they pushed the govt's "eat out to help out scheme" and said "where will you be eating, pizza, curry, chips?!" . but just a few months later they ran with "Did eat out to help out cause the deaths of thousands in the UK?"</p>
<p><strong>Why do people fall for the boom-bust cycle every fucking time?</strong></p>
<p>The powerful are not stupid enough to lead us to tyranny in a straight line. No, they'll dance us there instead. They'll waltz us and spin us, and open the world to us and close it again. They'll do this Boom-Bust, Open-Shut routine a few times, and each time round they'll use the "folly" of the last grand opening as an excuse to make the next shutdown that bit  harder, longer and more totalitarian.</p>
<p>As long as you know this, think about this, don't let them fool you. Fascism only marches in straight lines when it's already firmly established. You won't see it coming in straight lines until it's already here.</p>
