    <strong>Taking off the mask?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone! </p>
<p>I’m sure those of you south of border (CAN/US) haven’t had to worry about this for a while, I understand life is mostly back to normal for you folks (?)</p>
<p>In Canada, it is as bad as it’s ever been in terms of lockdowns and non-sensical restrictions on everyday life.</p>
<p>I’ve been complying with most of our orders thus far (masks required in public, non-essential shopping prohibited, my gym has been closed for a month+ and I lost my job, so I’ve found it pretty easy to comply since I don’t have any thing left I’m allowed to do)</p>
<p>Anyways, I’ll end my pity-party at that. My question for you fine folks is does anyone routinely just <em>lie</em> about a mask exemption or vaccine status in order to not have to wearing a mask or any other benefit? This is something I’m considering doing, because I’m sick of this sick. Do you guys think it is immoral to lie about that stuff?</p>
<p>Thanks all, looking forward to seeing your opinions</p></p>

        <p>Most big businesses here in the US don't require masks, but a lot of small businesses do.</p>
<p>And, don't kid yourself, tons of people are continuing to wear masks even in businesses where they aren't required. I think this will continue at the very least through the end of the summer.</p>

        <p>I doubt masks will permanently become a fixture in the West. I think the people who talk about masking permanently are FOS.</p>
<p>However, I think that masking in indoor settings will continue being the norm in the US through the end of the summer, and the last people might not stop doing so until about 12 months from now.</p>

        <p>I have  a legitimate medical exemption and I think literally zero people have every believed me. Ive been treated like I should die coz i have a disability and the human rights tribunal isnt doing anything </p>
<p>Anti-maskers were the only people who gave a shit about me and thank god coz they woke me up to alot of stuff. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>No one honours medical exemptions. Either they don't enforce the mandate or they are willing to deny you essential services/goods (like food and medication) on the basis that there's a 50%* greater risk that you could give them a flu. The shittiest thing is my disability makes it hard for me to have a life so when this started I had literally 0 social contacts, but people who partied with a thousand different people were supposedly less contagious than me</p>

        <p>thanks (: it legit is a comfort that sane and compassionate people DO exist, though rare </p>
<p>also IDGAF if anyone fakes a medical exemption, I wish more people would in solidarity. It may not be worth the risk though, doomers are rabid and violent zombies. The truth is coming out now about alot of stuff</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry! In the US, this is exactly how the doomers treat people with a legitimate medical exemption. They are the biggest bunch of virtue signaling assholes. They went from calling on stores to have a special shopping hour for people like you &amp; the elderly to be able to shop safely. And they used you &amp; the elderly as an excuse to demand everyone sTaY tHe fUcK HoMe but then when it came to the masks, they did a complete 180 and said those people should be staying home anyway! They went from “we need to protect the high risk and the elderly” to “the high risk and the elderly should be staying home” real quick. I will never forgive them for that. My mom has 72 &amp; is on oxygen 24/7. Masks make her oxygen levels drop. Fuck every dr who says that doesn’t happen. It does. My mom is proof. And she does not live a normal life anymore. She has to use a mobility scooter outside the house now because her breathing is so bad. She can get by with a walker if she doesn’t have to walk much. And people seriously said she should just stay home if she won’t wear the mask!</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear about your mom. Are you close enough to be able to support her in person?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I can't forgive people either. This year radically changed my beliefs about human nature and I'm still in shock about it. I wish I was surprised hearing about how your mom has been treated, but that's exactly the approach I've seen here. I've always been into stuff like volunteering, giving to the food bank, random acts of kindness, but this year has changed that for me. I feel sick at the generosity I extended to people who are willing to starve me to death as a virtue signal. Hopefully we can find a way to move on and find some sort of meaning and peace? I'm slowly becoming more at peace with all of this, but only knowing I'll never trust people again. </p>

        <p>Thanks. Unfortunately I’m 6hrs away from my parents so I can’t do very much for them. The only silver lining to my kids schools being closed for over a year is that it allowed us to visit my parents quite few times! My parents both received cancer diagnoses toward the end of 2020 also so I was able to go up and take care of them which I am thankful for. My dad is cancer free. My mom is in the middle of chemo but they said got all the cancer out of her (double mastectomy). All of this has shown me how many self-centered narcissists there are in the world. Everything from sheltering-in-place to masks to vaccines, it all centers on the doomers &amp; their fear of the virus. At the end the day it always came down to them needing to be safe. They really didn’t give a damn about anyone else. </p>
<p>My username is stupid LOL. I have been selling (and buying) on eBay for over 20 years now and spent years as a regular poster on their community message boards helping other members. Basically provided free customer service (and now apparently eBay pays members to do what I and many others did for free). Anyway I got permanently banned after some major drama and it pissed me off how it all went down. I discovered the r/eBay subbreddit right after and decided I could use my knowledge here to help other ebayers.  that’s when I made this account and chose my stupid name. I wish Reddit allowed us to change our user names!</p>

        <p>Do I think it is immoral to lie about having been vaccinated for a false pandemic perpetrated to all mankind in order to have them volunteer to take an experimental drug which is deadlier than the virus itself?  Fock No!  Do whatever you need to do to outwit, outplay and outlast these sadistic homosapiens.</p>

        <p>Except when I go to the doctor's office (where masking is still required, and where I have to go almost weekly), I don't wear a mask, and haven't for several months. Most people won't question it, as I'm about 8 months pregnant now and it's getting into the 90s in both temperature and humidity, so breathing isn't easy without a mask, much less with one. They probably also assume I took the vaccine, or that I forgot and they don't want to risk upsetting a pregnant woman over a mask. For the most part, a lot of businesses still have the signs encouraging people to mask up where I'm at, and it's about 50/50 on those who do and those who won't. I'm not lying about any exemptions - according to the CDC I should be masking or vaccinated; however, I've found that eating healthy and getting exercise helps with my immune system (and is great for baby), and that does better with keeping me from getting COVID more than a mask ever would.</p>
