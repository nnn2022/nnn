    <strong>Listening to a book today and this quote caught my attention</strong>
    <p><p>‘Most people tend to believe that the scientific theories of their time are the right ones, and that what remains for scientists to develop wondrous new technologies from their absolute understanding of nature’s laws, structures, and mechanisms.  Even many scientists succumb to the illusion that they live in the age of ultimate enlightenment.  They become so committed to a theory that they spend entire careers ever more desperately defending it as new discoveries ever more rapidly undermine it
Aristotle’s theory that the universe was not created in a singular event, that it had eternally existed, was the unanimous scientific view for twenty three hundred years.  Then in the early 1950s we discovered the universe is expanding, driven ever outward by the force of the big bang that created it.  What was known for twenty three hundred years was wrong.  Even in the latter part of the nineteenth century, it was believed that living organisms could spontaneously generate from inert matter.  Insects fromn rotting vegetables or dung for example.  How ludicrous that sounds now.  And much of what we believe we know now will appear equally ludicrous in a hundred or two hundred years. ‘</p>
<p>Granted it's a sci fi book but Dean Koontz is usually pretty solid with his research and that quote made me think 'hey I wonder what we will all know about trusting the science in a few years'</p></p>
