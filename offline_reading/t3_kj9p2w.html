    <strong>I hate what CNN has done to my father</strong>
    <p><p>I'm visiting my family for the first time in months.  It has been a very difficult year, for all of us.  We're all hurting, and it has been very nice all being together.  At times, I've almost forgotten about the Scamdemic.</p>
<p>Today we had a lovely day.  We talked, and laughed, and even held hands at the dinner table to pray.  I used to hate that.  Today, it felt great physically being with my family for the first time in months.</p>
<p>But then this evening, my father turned on the TV.  He put it right on CNN.</p>
<p>He starts looking over and saying, "can you believe Trump did that!?".  I tell him I can, and I support Trump for these reasons.  Then he starts getting upset.  </p>
<p>Then my mom starts getting angry at me.  I ask her why; I've only merely stated my disagreement, and I think it's great we're able to see things differently.  She starts getting sarcastic, and starts saying normally that would be okay, but not about Trump.  </p>
<p>Now my dad is raising his voice and getting real upset.  My brother starts lecturing me.  They start making these grandiose absurd claims like, "he's a dictator!" and "he's dangerous for our democracy!!", spoken in hushed tones, in exactly the same manner as a CNN pundit.</p>
<p>I try to defend my point, but my dad turns up the TV.  Now the CNN panel is on, and their talking about Trump and how bad he is.  Big surprise.  They say, "look!  Can you hear this?".  And I tell them I can, and here are the counter points.  But this gets drowned out in the chaos, the tv at max volume, CNN continuing their relentless attack.</p>
<p>It eventually reaches a climax where I say fuck it, I'm going to bed.  Evening over.  Everyone's upset.  They mock me on my way to bed.  If they weren't my family, I would have told them all to immediately go and fuck themselves.  But I hold my tongue. No one sleeps well.  We all go to bed angry.</p>
<p>My father used to be a reasonable person.  He used to be knowledgeable and well-rounded.</p>
<p>Now, he's an absolute Trump maniac.  Anything short of complete hatred, and it drives him wild.  He can't even think straight.  When I suggest terrible things the Democrats have done he is completely oblivious.  He's completely unaware of Hunter Biden, even though he's just spent the last 20 minutes complaining about government corruption.</p>
<p>My friends, we're not even American.  This whole thing barely affects us.  At the end of the day even if Trump is the devil himself it wouldn't matter, he isn't our President, literally.</p>
<p>I want to punch my fist right through a wall.  This whole fucking goddamn year has been an absolute shitshow.  I feel like we've stepped into the loony bin.  It's one thing reading random comments from some dipshits on the Internet; it's another when your own father starts attacking you using CNN talking points.</p>
<p>My father is getting old.  He isn't healthy anymore.  His blood pressure is high, and he's put on weight.  I don't want to be aggressive with him.  I don't want challenge him.  I just want to be with him.  Spend the last of his years in harmony.  I just want to be a family again.</p>
<p>One might say I should just lie and pretend I agree with him.  But I cannot lie.  And besides, he would know and take even more egregious positions.  I know it would never end.  The man is completely blinded with rage.  I have never, ever seen him hate someone so completely.  He's a peaceful man.</p>
<p>CNN has done this to him.</p>
<p>He doesn't watch other American news, or do research on his own.  He doesn't use the internet much.  He just watches CNN.</p>
<p>They have turned him into a crazed maniac spewing hatred.  </p>
<p>Setting my parents and my brother watching CNN was like being in 1984 and witnessing the Two Minutes Of Hate.</p>
<p>Fuck CNN.</p>
<p>Fuck this pandemic.</p>
<p>Fuck the people who did this to us.</p>
<p>But especially, fuck CNN.</p></p>

        <p>I love people who say Trump is a dictator.  What has he done to make him a dictator?  Close schools, restaurants, keep you from your family?  Trump didn't do that.</p>

        <p>This is reasonably easy to break.</p>
<p>“Ok, explain to me what a dictator does. What are the characteristics?”</p>
<p>They’ll list something. Usually more or less correct. If not, well that has to be dealt with. Dictionaries are useful.</p>
<p>“Perfect, ok that makes sense. Now, can you show me what ABC has done that checks off those boxes?”</p>
<p>This is where things get dicey. You get sputtering, hem and hawing, maybe a couple specific instances that aren’t from the dictator list.</p>
<p>This requires a gentle touch.</p>
<p>“Right, ok so I see this part is harder. That’s ok. There’s no shame in considering that maybe the language we’ve used is imprecise. If dictator isn’t a good word, what might be?”</p>
<p>This usually rights the conversation. You’ve opened a door to let them keep foaming but without the word dictator. Some people of course will see where you’re going and just go even more nuts. Nothing you can do for them. Focus on the ones who seem receptive.</p>
<p>It requires about 25-30 such conversations to restore humanity to people and their communication.</p>
<p>And that’s why we’re all basically fucked.</p>
<p>It requires more work to undo via repetition, what was sown via repetition. No way a single human can make headway here even in their own sphere. We’d never get any work done. Only the media can - and they never will. The only solution really is a popular uprising (not saying a violent one, just a groundswell of support for a new way of thinking). Get that and the media would follow (or be replaced). Also never gonna happen.</p>
<p>And then that’s where I conclude that the best possible thing that can happen is some version of war.</p>

        <p>We never get that far into the conversation.  He usually walks away or turns up the TV.  </p>
<p>When I've tried this with other people, they just get angry at me, and start yelling or attacking me personally.</p>
<p>To this day I haven't been able to get one of these people to listen to reason about Trump.  It's like when it comes to Trump, all logic, reason, and grace go right out the window.</p>

        <p>Yep exactly. My overall point really was more that even if you can get through once, fixing the problem requires a Herculean effort far beyond what a reasonable person would put in and that we’re basically screwed.</p>
<p>I don’t have an answer... that’s why I said war. When people’s ACTUAL well being is threatened they tend to pay greater care and attention to the world around them instead of the one they built in their heads.</p>

        <p>Yeah man.  You know it's crazy, because I'm Canadian, which almost automatically qualifies me as a leftist.</p>
<p>But starting in about October 2019, I started wanting to leave my country.  Those SJW mother fuckers tarred and feathered one of our great Canadian icons (Don Cherry).  If you don't know who that is, he's a hockey commentator, and he is a great Canadian Legend.  He is also one of me personal heroes.  I have an enormous love and respect for Don Cherry.</p>
<p>When they threw him under the bus, those sanctimonious mother fuckers, just a few months after defending Prime Minister Blackface, I swear I've never been so outraged in all my life.  I've never been so disappointed in all my life.  I've never felt such shame and hatred for my own country in which I grew up and have given so very much.</p>
<p>In short, it made me want to leave Canada.</p>
<p>And this whole year, has definitely made me want to leave Canada.</p>
<p>I had dreams of going and joining like minded people in the States.  But now that Biden has stolen the election, I don't think that's a great place to go either.</p>
<p>I still can't believe those mother fuckers threw Don Cherry under the bus.  I cried every night for a month.  I can't even express in writing how important, and how deeply this cut me personally.  </p>
<p>I will never forgive them for this.  Never.  </p>
<p>If our country keeps going in this direction, and if my parents keep going in this direction, I may have no other choice but to leave.  </p>
<p>Fuck the dishonest fuckfaces who have done this to our country.  Fuck them.</p>

Now, mister EU himself, Guy Shitstadt, is making fun of the Brits "haha, borders are back" on his Twitter, when the borders are closed, a decision lauded by all the globalists, for "halting" the Coronavirus.<br>
(Supposedly a new mutant strain from UK, but it was already months in Europe continent btw.)</p>

        <p>When I look around at the friends and family who made it through the year relatively sane they all have one thing in common - no TV. </p>
<p>I mean we have two TVs in the apartment we're renting but I have no idea if either of them work, we've never turned them on. Most of my closest friends are the same, we don't have any issues with TV... we just don't watch it. </p>
<p>TV is propaganda on steroids and I don't even know when it transitioned from "having a perspective" to "YOU MUST HAVE THIS PERSPECTIVE". All I know is that it makes people mentally ill.</p>

        <p>I agree.  No news is key.  </p>
<p>My family will watch some streaming stuff, and we like Football and other sports, but that's it. We never put on any news. Not network or local.  Both are just as bad.  </p>
<p>We are also smart enough to know it's nothing but propaganda and isn't to be trusted.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry about your mom. When the op said "<em>My friends, we're not even American.</em>" I was taken aback.</p>
<p>But the same thing has happened to my parents. They watch CNN and start mindlessly parroting everything they hear.</p>
<p>When I pointed out that the $600 stimulus check was measly and insulting, my stepdad immediately chirps "that's what your precious trump-tards want!" When I point out that Trump was unhappy with the stimulus bill and wanted to increase the amount he called me a liar.</p>
<p>I should add that my stepdad is a business owner and has been shafted by the lockdown, and yet he still supports it. "Because it's better than being dead" he insists he knows "seven people who have died of covid" which sounds dubious to me.
It's worrisome.</p>

<p>OP calls out CNN for good reason.  But the arguments against MSM in general, or really all media including social, apply equally to FOX. If you call Fox ~~News~~ Opinion Fair and Unbiased, you owe an apology to the English Language. </p>

        <p>Maybe. He does get paid by the network, but they allow him a reasonable amount of freedom due to how popular his show is. </p>
<p>Tucker Carlson is wealthy, he is an heir to the Swanson TV dinner company, but his wealth is still less than many leftist pundits. I don't know if that makes him "elite" though.</p>
<p>I watch Tucker Carlson because he is one of the very few dissident voices left in media.</p>

        <p>I know people that bitched and complained in 2016 that their rights were going to be taken away because Trump won, and also when Biden “won” people that were overjoyed that they were going to be able to keep their rights because he won. The irony that democrats have been the party of authoritarianism this year is completely lost on them. It’s truly shocking.

        <p>Exactly. CNN, MSNBC especially, the New York Times, etc. spent most of 2016 thru 2019 warning us that our rights are in danger from this authoritarian wannabe dictator. Books were written. “This is how democracy dies”, they said. Then, as Spring approached... freedoms suddenly became “freedumbs”. Individual rights are selfish desires. A true 1984-style reversal. And the most of the world swallowed it whole. If you’d predicted ANY of this a year ago I would never have believed it. But here we are.</p>

        <p>Trump, yes. On and on about how we’re going to lose our freedoms to the authoritarian right (e.g. MSNBC). Then we actually do start losing them. But that’s OK... it’s from their side, the left. For the public good. Nothing bad here, shut up, mask up 😷 and lock down🔒.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry to hear that. It's super sad and infuriating. I had a similar situation, only it was 'just' a best and very close friend. Between him going extreme left and getting sadistic with people who were on the "alt" right, then shaming me for COVID related things, it ended with a big blow out. I really hope this won't happen between you and your father. Hopefully you can agree to...not watch the news together.</p>
<p>You know, I never even liked Trump until this whole recount started happening. I've always thought the two parties were theater, elite pulled all of the strings, Trump was a puppet just like the rest, and I never voted. But, I back this because if I am wrong then I would want to know elections aren't rigged.</p>
<p>And for me it's not just "fuck CNN", it's fuck the 'Big Five', Facebook, Twitter. and in many cases Youtube. If there is a civil war, it will absofuckinglutely be because of them. It makes me so angry.</p>

        <p>Whether family members or friends I think most of us can relate.  It is so sad what they have done to people.</p>
<p>One thing I realized is if they have no idea where to find real information, theyre not only completely unaware but theyre never going to be exposed to anything different.  </p>
<p>Offering a solid alternative at least opens up that option.   Eg "hey you know I came across this show I think youd really like".  Ive done this with Ron Paul's liberty report and had success.  I think that given exposure, most people can snap out of it/regain perspective on the insanity of tv news.  Theyre just not getting that exposure/often aware of where to find it.</p>

        <p><em>"Today we had a lovely day. We talked, and laughed, and even held hands at the dinner table to pray. I used to hate that. Today, it felt great physically being with my family for the first time in months."</em></p>
<p>This is the only thing Americans should be focused on. You and your father should drop politics if you want civility in each others presence. The reason I am apolitical personally is because I've witnessed healthy and mutually beneficial relationships destroyed over personal opinions on abstract subjects. It's ridiculous, and for what? CNN isn't the only culprit. Your father has been trained to trust an approved MSM news outlet like every other fearful person.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>"But then this evening, my father turned on the TV. He put it right on CNN. He starts looking over and saying, "can you believe Trump did that!?". I tell him I can, and I support Trump for these reasons. Then he starts getting upset."</em></p>
<p>Who cares? My dad also has it on CNN all the time but for me it's no different than Fox, NBC, ABC, hell EFG, LMNOP, lol! When I'm with my dad I focus on the fact that I'm <em>with</em> my dad and the fact that he's still alive we had some semblance of normalcy. Fuck politics. Fuck Trump Fuck Biden. Do you think Trump gives a fuck about whether you and your dad get along because of him? This is ALL BULLSHIT. It's designed to do that. There is no political savior, there is only YOU and your decisions. I've decide to live and let live and love like there's no tomorrow because there isn't....because once you awaken, it's always today....</p>

        <p>I understand your frustration. I've been through it too. Lost friends. No major blow outs exactly, but I've just kinda slowly stepped away because it's apparent their thinking is dogmatic in a way that makes a rational person feel completely impotent in trying to reach them. 
I'm very fortunate to have a father who knows what's up and speaking with him has been cathartic. My mother and I have agreed not to discuss politics or covid. 
Anyway, I don't have to tell you you're not alone. Hopefully the topic can be thoroughly dropped tomorrow and you all can enjoy Christmas together.
And yeah, fuck cnn and all the rest of em.</p>

        <p>I punish myself sometimes and watch CNN for the fuck of it and see what the latest programming is for the day. That station is pure evil and head of the propaganda machine.</p>
<p>If i was planning a resistance or a war against TPTB that run this station, CNN would be the first target i would knock out. A bit like how the army knock out the communication capabilities of their enemy before they go in.</p>

        <p>TV is a drug. It is used to pacify the common people.<br>
TV is poison. Those "crazy" people, religious or political, who forego the use of TV, were actually totally right.<br>
I never watch it.<br>
Now with the pandemic, and the Trump Derangement Syndrome, do I get aware that TV's influence on people is far worse than I thought.<br>
It's not a neutral evil. It is actively evil.  </p>
<p>People are shitting their pants if someone walks "too close" by them in open air. This is what TV caused them to do.<br>
Social media is not much better.<br>
Facebook and Twitter work in an addictive way, and they are geared to make people react emotional rather than rational.<br>
It's no coincidence that 2010-2020 is not only the age of Social Media like FB and Twitter, but also the age of BLM, ISIL, ..  </p>
<p>Both TV and Social Media seem to have destroyed the way people can do causative thinking.<br>
When you for example counterargue their TDS, or when you point out how "science" and our leaders change their tune almost daily on how to counteract the CCP-flu, they will not accept your explanation. Most people simply say "well the authorative sources say this".  </p>

Instead they title their YouTube captions as "Trump throws covid relief under the bus" when he is asking for more covid relief. Fucking disgusting levels of obvious bias lately.

        <p>Same. My father is 74 and lives on the other side of the country. He hasn't seen me or his grandkids in 12 months because cnn convinced him he will die from covid if he ever breaks any rule. He originally planned to come visit us after getting  the vaccine next month, but that has now been cancelled because CNN told him he has to continue to mask and follow all social distancing rules even after getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>Hes trump deranged, and every time I talk to him he wants to shame some group of people he saw on CNN who dared to live a normal life.</p>

        <p>My mother is exactly like this and I don't know how she ended up hating Trump so bad. She doesn't get tv so probably social media. I think part of the reason she hates him is because he has money. But whenever she or I mentions covid, she goes off on a tangent, even when we were talking about covid in Canada as if he's the one who caused it to spread around the world.</p>

And if I ever tell them I’m a trump supporter especially for covid reasons they get all mad at me and call me “racist” and a bunch of other things that i’m not. Sigh.

        <p>I can't stand CNN or the local news anymore.</p>
<p>My dad is a big Republican so more or less sees it from my perspective.  My mom on the other hand is a big CNN watcher.  She doesn't really seem like a doomer herself but her new husband had a heart attack a couple years ago and that is his excuse to be full doomer and cancel family events.</p>
<p>I told her to stop watching it that stuff but she kinda just goes along with it understandably.</p>
<p>At least we are getting together for Christmas...  In a park.  I kinda wanted to not even go because it's over an hour drive but I'll try to be grateful and not make a stink about it.</p>

        <p>"The news" in general is just fear porn. My parents are addicted to it. It's rotting their minds. I can see it so clearly and yet they have a TV in almost every room with the news on in the AM, PM, and usually around lunchtime. It's fear based programming (mind control) and it's affecting their ability to sustain loving relationships with their family and well, ok they don't have any friends. It's sad. I feel like my parents have been stolen from me with only a shell of two bodies left to talk about the weather and assume the worst about anything else that comes up in conversation. Trying to steer their thoughts away from fear is a full time job. The only thing they know how to do is consume and accquire more wealth. No regards for culture, sustainability, social health, mental health. They lack the ability to formulate coherent thoughts and there is simply no ability being demonstrated to think critically in any way. It's disturbing. Meanwhile the attitude they have towards millennials is blatant bigotry, making claims that we are worthless and that their generation has done everything better. I just want my parents back, and I want to remember a loving relationship with my family while they are still around. Instead I get drone #1 and drone #2.</p>

        <p>I have a very similar experience with my parents, lifelong Democrats, and CNN (CNBC, MSNBC, pretty much all mainstream news, etc.). Its a very interesting phenomenon isn't it? They are brainwashed I think. I was just going to say, its not worth it to argue with them. They're not doing it to hurt you. Are they being assholes? Yes. But you said it yourself, besides the brainwashing thing, they're still your much loved family. I've learned to just ask uncomfortable questions. Its actually kind of fun. I don't know if they suspect I didn't vote for their guy... Anyways 🤷🏼‍♂️ I don't want to look back later and realize I was an asshole too. I feel bad for them</p>

        <p>If you want to get your family away from mainstream media, get him a roku or other smart tv player and you guys can break out of the mainstream blob, here are some suggested live channels to get away from the liberal MSM corporate garbage. </p>
<ul>
<li>TYT via PlutoTV  </li>
<li>Free Speech TV  </li>
<li>Democracy now, not technically live but has a daily program at least  </li>
<li>RT (yes, that RT) actually has a pretty decent stable of content - Chris Hedges' show, Redacted Tonight, World According to Jesse Ventura....   </li>
<li>Means TV is a paid subscription, but it's an entirely worker-made, non-mainstream media service with no advertising or elitist corporate democrat content</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully you and your family can find some of this content enlightening :)</p>

        <p>And I thought my relative was bad. Long story short she lives in America but isn't an American and her only source of info regarding whatever happens in America are 2 or 3 news channels, all of them leftist cesspools.</p>
<p>She defended th rapist that got shot in the back as he was going to reach for a weapon (the one who was about to kidnap the kids he wasn't allowed to see) because some of those "news" channels said he was picking the kids up at the daycare, she is adamant on Trump being racist because of some leftist talking points (can't remember right now but I think it was about him wanting to end sanctuary cities and not wanting to speak with someone because "he was latino") to then say I am misinformed and that the news don't tell everything (of course she assumes everyone else's  only source of info is/should be her leftist echo chamber).</p>

        <p>It's really wild how both sides can get so crazy and worked up. My experience has been that Trump supporters act like your Dad and their favorite tv is FOX News. I've lost long time friends over their bizarre Trump worshipping behavior. They would get aggressive and talk over me. Put me down. They weren't willing to listen to anything I said. My friends are at odds with their parents over this same behavior. </p>
<p>BUT. Big BUT here. NOW I am starting to relate more to those who back Trump. It's the craziest thing that I never would've seen coming. I've never been a President worshipper, but I did not like Trump based on the rare video I saw of him or his tweets. But I wasn't crazed over it. I just tuned it out. I used to sort of live life with no worries or thought about the government, but 2020 has opened my eyes to so much. I stopped buying the propaganda in early April. I listen to my one brother who used to annoy me with red pill talk. I listen to my tin foil hat friend without mentally dismissing her. 2020 has changed me. I hope more people wake up.</p>

        <p>I lost an important friend group for the same reason. It was pretty much my only one due to autism on my part. I stated calmly that I wanted Trump to win and why. Next thing I know my "friends" are spewing the most ridiculous bullshit imaginable at me about how Trump wants to kill all minorities and Jews, how I'm a nazi, how Trump is responsible for suicides, etc. It would have been an astonishing look into how completely mainstream media can warp people's minds if it wasn't directed at me personally. I've been pretty depressed since.</p>

        <p>Like you, I think of myself as reasonable in terms of Trump.   More on the I like his actions but not him for the most part.</p>
<p>But, my parents are the most conservative Trump and Republican fans, ever, and what Fox News has done to my mom sucks.</p>
<p>I hate CNN and the main media outlets for their lies.  I hate Fox for their lies.  And, living in GA, I hate all of the commercials, from both sides.</p>

<p>I remember back like even just ten years ago, we could have political discussions, and maybe we would disagree.  But we'd just shrug it off and laugh.  It wasn't this intense, burning hatred.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  Like somehow if it's not coming the NYT, WaPo or one of the big TV networks then it's automatically inaccurate or somehow fake.  </p>
<p>As long as a news story is sourced well and can back up their story it shouldn't matter where it comes from.</p>

        <p>Yes, yes, 1000x over. I could have written your post myself. Same experience basically.</p>
<p>CNN is sort of like what FOX used to be to people in the 2001 "fear terrorism era."</p>
<p>Ironically, the people who succumbed to the propaganda are typically the same people who criticized Fox viewers when things were flipped.</p>
<p>The biggest nonsense of all is that NONE of these big politicians represent the people. Not Biden. Not Trump. No congressman and no senator.</p>
<p>So it's completely absurd to be excited about one over another. They aren't here for us, they are salesmen peddling the agenda of whatever transglobal corporations paid for their campaigns.</p>
<p>But the media really has divided us. Over race. Over gender. Over economics. Over masks. Over lockdowns. Over politicians. Over everything.</p>
<p>Working people only have power when united, so they fan the flames of division to make sure that never happens.</p>

        <p>I just put on CNN for two minutes and they are still pushing constant doom and gloom. They were saying we will have 570,000 dead by April but we could save 36,000 more lives through more mask wearing. How did they come up with that 36,000 number? They are also really trying hard to make people feel guilty for seeing family over Christmas as well. </p>
<p>My parents are “conservative” but they have big time TDS (definitely Never Trumpers). Anything Trump does or says triggers them. They do watch a lot of CNN and that keeps the anger towards Trump alive and well. I try to keep quiet about my politics anytime I visit but it does get frustrating at times when they have CNN constantly on the TV set and shout “Orange Man Bad” at every little thing Trump does or says.</p>

        <p>Today I had to spend a few agonizing minutes in front of a TV with CNN on at the gym. The headline:</p>
<p><em>"COVID RELIEF BILL IN LIMBO WHILE AMERICANS SUFFER AS TRUMP GOLFS, CREATES CHAOS AND PARDONS CRONIES"</em></p>
<p>I furiously wondered how many people would read that and blindly assume the bill is stalled <em>because</em> Trump wants to golf and do evil things <em>instead of</em> "helping those in need," when in reality he's trying to get everybody an extra $1,400 (which the left should love, but nooo—there's just no winning).</p>
<p>Why do they have to spin it that way? If they think Trump's attempt is unrealistic, too late or whatever, can't they just say that instead? Let people make up their own goddamn minds as to whether they support waiting a bit longer for a chance to get more money, or whether they'd rather give up and get $600 now. 🤬</p>

        <p>It's unreal.</p>
<p>Did you see how quickly the Media pivoted from "Trump wants to hold up the Bill because of a measly $600!?" to "Trump wants to hold up an amended Bill while he plays golf!!".  (No mention he personally had a great deal to extend the payout).</p>
<p>No matter what he says, they will say the opposite.   </p>
<p>It's totally insane.  It's exactly like 1984.</p>

        <p>MSNBC is the same (prob worse) while we’re at it. My mother in law was a conservative her first 66yrs. Now full on TDS. Brought up every time we see her.</p>

        <p>I genuinely find it hard to believe that people still watch the lamestream, corporate media. I haven't watched the mainstream news since 2007, and I haven't owned a TV in over a decade. Have these people never seen a Joe Rogan, Alex Jones, or Ron Paul video? It's like eating stale bread when you could have a fat, juicy steak.</p>

        <p>I assume you support Trump because of conservative values he pushes. You should tell your family the conservative values and ideas you hold and how Trump fights for them. Then say that you two might disagree on them but that you won't take being name called. Engage with them if they seem like they are actually listening or just talk about something else, you just have to show them that you still see them as your family no matter what they think about Trump. If they watch CNN and turn it up then you can either go to your room or go out for fresh air. It is sad that some people don't want to hear conflicting ideas but it shouldn't break up your relationship with your family.</p>

        <p>OMG. My dad survived my mom dying without requiring meds, but 2 years later -- 24/7 CNN has him going on antidepressants.</p>
<p>And with the lockdown he went from being fit and healthy for his age to gaining 60 pounds. Technically obese now.</p>
<p>They are quite literally killing people and breaking our families apart.</p>
<p>This isn't unintentional, either. People with great wealth don't 'accident' their way into more control, power, and wealth.</p>

        <p>Well, I obviously disagree.</p>
<p>Is it possible for people to just simply disagree these days?</p>

        <p>I'm sorry your family was unkind and that they think Democrats do no wrong. But Trump is objectively awful, and I'm truly stunned at these kinds of posts glorifying him. He's not done much right except being against lockdowns. He's taken away rights from large groups of people, and attempted to do more in that vein. It's not OK to try to take away rights from groups of people just because you personally dislike them. We've never in history had a president who would flail about on stage imitating a mentally challenged person or who can barely utter a sentence without lying and self-aggrandizing. And those are just a couple things out of thousands of problems. That's why few anywhere on the liberal end of the spectrum are going to listen to your talking points. It's just too horrible.</p>

<p>He's done that gesture multiple times while criticizing multiple people. It wasn't specifically directed at the disabled journalist, but the fact that you believe that shows how successful the MSM has been at pitching fictional narratives.</p>

        <p>I never liked trump, but his position on the 'rona is much more balanced. Odd, really. So I don't support him but is he worse than Biden? Not that I have to care anyway, I'm not American.</p>

        <p>Trump didn't mock that handicapped reporter.  He didn't even know that reporter was handicapped.</p>
<p>But sure, personality wise, Trump is an asshole.</p>
<p>But for most of us who support Trump, it isn't a question of the personal morality of the individual.  It's about policy. </p>
<p>Besides, he needs to be an asshole, in order to deal with the dishonest attacks from the establishment.  </p>
<p>It's like hiring a lawyer.  You don't hire a lawyer because you think he's a "good person".  You hire a lawyer because he gets the job done.</p>

        <p>I have a story about my parents divorcing after 43 years of marriage in 2017 because of how insane and intolerant he (Trump) made my mother.  Obviously a lot of other underlying issues with her but he snapped her so beyond reality.  Sounds made up too.  Believe it or not, there is a world of absurd shit outside your bubble and TDS is so very real.</p>
