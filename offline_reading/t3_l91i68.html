    <strong>How come not doing everything you can to “StOp ThE sPrEaD” is seen as a moral failing?</strong>
    <p><p>Two years ago if a person who’s mother was dying of a flu infection started ranting at everyone for spreading the flu, they would be seen as a troubled, grieving person who needed help, but who wouldn’t be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Before all this, the assumption was that unless you knowingly and <strong>intentionally</strong> infected someone with a disease that you carried, you weren’t responsible for them getting sick, even if the disease jumped directly from you to them. What reason is there (besides the government and media shoving it down people’s throats) for this moral responsibility suddenly changing?</p>
<p>If you’re a lurker who genuinely believes that people going about their lives normally are personally responsible for COVID-19 deaths, please dm me because I’m genuinely interested in discussing it with you</p></p>

        <p>Did no one else notice a couple years ago Reddit was pushing flu vaccines as a social obligation while most doctors and public health to my experience only recommend it for personal benefit (and I believe a lot of European countries it was only ever for high risk and maybe some occupations)?</p>

        <p>Yeah in Europe nobody vaccinates yearly against the flu. Only old people and probably people with serious health issues.</p>
