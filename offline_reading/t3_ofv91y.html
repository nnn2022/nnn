    <strong>How can one change the mind of a Covidian / Covidiot?</strong>
    <p><p>I think there is a real danger to this 'pro covid injection' mindset because enough of them are okay with using authoritarian and draconian measures to get their way. There is no shortage of 'smart' people acting a fool. Similarly there is no shortage of people here with the 'fuck em, no need to convince them' mindset. It is my opinion that the precedent of forced medical procedures is more dangerous than the jab. </p>
<p>The change I am looking for is disarming the authoritarianism surrounding the vaccine rather than changing their mind from 'vaxx good' to 'vaxx bad'. </p>
<p>I think most covidians are experiencing the Einstellung Effect, in short meaning that their existing fact/knowledge bank blinds them from other perspectives. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-adHRNYHbm0">Here is a video explaining the basics.</a> The problem I see with a logical approach is that too many facts in their knowledge banks are at odds with "anti covid vax" arguments. Multiple paradigm shifts would be required to convince someone on this topic, most commonly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trust --&rt; distrust of corporate media (often called redpilling)</li>
<li>Trust --&rt; distrust of government and government agencies</li>
<li>Trust --&rt; skepticism of scientists in general</li>
<li>Trust --&rt; distrust/skepticism of these instant consensuses. Plate tectonics and washing hands between handling dead people and childbirth were both highly controversial when introduced. 
The list goes on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Has anyone found a convincing shortcut or workaround that can avoid changing someone's mind on the above? Perhaps an emotional argument? Fortunately I am not yet in a position where I am being pressured to get vaccinated, but I have some friends who are and would like to help where I can. IMO this should be much like other vaccines where people are indifferent if someone else has it or not because those vaccines work.</p></p>

        <p>Typically I am also fine with people thinking as they wish. However, specifically with covid I don't think they will give us the same courtesy, hence the post. Without changing minds what are you going to do in the case of forced vaccinations?</p>

<p>I see your point, but the people I generally talk to are about as involved in policymaking as I am - which is not at all. It wouldn’t change the world if I <em>could</em> change their minds, and since I’d rather they kept <em>their</em> opinions to themselves, I do the same for them.</p>

        <p>The covidiot mind cannot be changed.  They can't think for themselves and rely on the MSM and politicians to do their thinking for them.  They are mindless drones and there is nothing you can say to change their Church of Covid cult mindset.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking about this lately too. I think continuing to ask questions to the person who you're trying to reach is important. Asking them open, relatively concise "why is it that (blank)" and "well what about (blank)" questions requires them to <em>really</em> think about what they are defending. </p>
<p>Most people's opinions about a subject are developed and refined passively and they may rarely have to articulate their thoughts about it out loud or even critically think about it. It could result in them verbally digging themselves in a hole and rethinking their entire life.</p>

        <p>Have you noticed how most (not all) of them are deeply unhappy and constantly afraid of everything, while at the same time being in a mode of constant anger?
There's underlying issues there. Our society is unwell. </p>
<p>There was a Western Zen master who had a female student who became estranged from her father. He drank a lot (probably pre-alcoholic) and smoked as well. She hated that. And she constantly nagged him to quit and urged him to change his ways and try Zen. He'd respond that she became a real killjoy. One day, she asked her Zen master how to reach him because she couldn't even have a normal relationship with him anymore.
He told her to buy a bottle of very good bourbon and to share it with him.
So she did.
She approached him and said 'I have here this bottle, would you care to join me?' And so he did. They drank and laughed and joked and he smoked and smiled. Then, the following week, she did the same. And the week after that.
Eventually, he said "what's gotten into you? You seem so joyous and full of life lately." She said "I tried this thing called meditation." He then agreed to try it with her.</p>
<p>You see, they aren't prepared to form their own perceptions any longer. You can present all the facts in the world, it simply won't compute.
If you meet them where they are, engage with them in ways that aren't related to the pre-made perceptions that inform them, you have the real chance to make their lives better. They will gain self-confidence. And people with confidence, eventually begin to form their own perceptions again.
I don't think you will change any single individuals' world view anymore. But by bringing the love and higher frequency, you will slowly change the world.</p>
<p>Sorry for being a little esoteric, but I honestly don't think reason is the route to take any longer. That battle is lost.</p>

        <p>I did that. It worked in so far as they don't try to embarrass me in front of other cultists anymore. But it came at a huge emotional cost. Both to the common relationship, and to my mental state. It's not the person I'd want to be. I am unfortunately very apt reading people's insecurities and if ticked off, I'll go ballistic in such a subtle way, I destroyed that person's self worth. I feel horrible about it and there's no way to make amends.
They taunted me for months on, day after day, but truth be told, I was pissed, it didn't affect my self perception in any way though. Eventually I snapped because it was just so absurdly dumb. Total regret. I should just have distanced myself.</p>
