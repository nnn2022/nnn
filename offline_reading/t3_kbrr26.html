    <strong>The Psychology of Masks</strong>
    <p><p>During the Korean war, those American POWs who ended up in Chinese prison camps were far more likely to inform on their fellow prisoners than were their counterparts imprisoned in North Korea. Successful escape attempts were, comparatively, extremely rare because usually a fellow inmate would divulge the escape plan to the prison guards before the plan could be executed. While the North Korean’s favored the use of harsh violence to keep their prisoners in line, the Chinese employed a subtle yet extremely powerful brainwashing technique. The Chinese method started with a simple request: admit that America is imperfect. Give an example of a small flaw with the capitalist system, and also a way that communism might have some advantage. These small requests came frequently, and then gradually the Chinese began asking for bigger and bigger concessions: expand upon why you think America could be improved, make a list of things wrong with America, give us your permission to read your list out over the camp radio and tell all the inmates that you wrote it. Over time they came to view themselves as being collaborators with the enemy, if only reluctant collaborators. When later asked why they had betrayed their fellow soldiers, they would say that they felt guilty but gave a rationalization for why they wanted to (or had to) do it anyway. Simple, yet incredibly effective, the Chinese had stumbled upon the psychological principles of commitment, and consistency, although they didn’t fully understand it at the time (source: Robert B. Cialdini PhD, Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion). </p>
<p>Humans have a strong urge to stick to and to defend decisions that they feel responsible for making, this is the principle of commitment. Humans have a strong urge to show an appearance of consistency with their past actions, to rationalize, and to modify their own beliefs to be consistent with the actions they have made, this is the principle of consistency. To exploit a person by using these principles, first pressure them to make a decision. The lighter and more subtle the pressure the better, because it helps a person to take responsibility for making the choice, but you must still apply enough pressure that the choice is actually made. As well, the more uncomfortable or the more ridiculous it feels to make this decision the better because it forces a person to create bigger rationalizations and more drastic changes to their beliefs in order to feel consistent with having made that decision. If the discomfort inflicted is too great, however, then the person may not do what you want and so it helps to start with smaller, less uncomfortable decisions first and work your way up by leveraging the principle of consistency to narrow the gap toward the next bigger decision until you finally reach your end goal.</p>
<p>So what about masks?</p>
<p>At first they asked you to stay home for your own safety. Just for two weeks, and it was easy enough to do, just sit at home and watch Netflix. Besides, it was all for your own safety so you wanted to do it anyway. Next the two weeks turned into months. It was no longer so much fun, but still it wasn’t so hard and you got to work from home or collect a government paycheck if you couldn’t, and sometimes you could go outside as long as you social distanced. Besides, you were saving people’s lives, so you wanted to do it anyway. Next they asked you to wear masks when you couldn’t social distance. Masks are uncomfortable, they make it hard to breathe and to see people’s faces and they are just a bit humiliating, but still, how hard is it to wear a piece of cloth over your face for a few hours when doctors and nurses wear them all day. Besides, you were slowing down the spread, so you wanted to do it anyway. Next they asked you to always wear a mask when in-doors and you could be fined if you didn’t, but the fine is just for the bad people who aren’t as smart as you, everybody else is wearing a mask. It’s not at all pleasant to wear masks all day, and now you might get mask breath and it all seems a little ridiculous to wear a mask from the door to your table in a restaurant only to take it off when seated but this is just something that you have to do. Besides, you were reducing the viral load of the vulnerable people around you and showing solidarity with your community so you wanted to do it anyway. Or maybe you aren’t so sure that you’re doing any good but you decided to just go along with everybody else and you want to fit in, or because everybody else is a brain-washed sheep and you could never convince them anyway, or because it’s just too hard to go against the government so there’s no use trying, or because you have to or you might lose your job, or because you just don’t really care about all this anyway.</p>
<p>But one way or another, it was your choice to do nothing, it was your choice to just go along with the rest of the crowd. You just wanted to do it, anyway.</p></p>

        <p>I find it  extremely creepy how many people genuinely love wearing the masks. It's just a way for them to hide away in public, when eight months ago they would have been looked at strangely if they had gone out in public wearing a mask. Now they screech about you being the one who wants granny to die when you don't want to hide your face, it's like the perfect excuse for people who were already asocial to try to force it on everyone else by trying to guilt them. I'm an introvert and don't always enjoy being around people, but I want to see people's faces. The idea of an entire generation growing up not being able to see faces and interpret facial expressions is equally depressing and horrifying.</p>

        <p>I honestly know people who used to be horrified at the burqa and notes how uncomfortable it must be for those women to have fabric (probably less tight and think than a mask...) covering their mouth and nose all day... now say they don’t mind the mask much. </p>

        <p>Wow.  Thank you for saying it.  Reminds me of the movie <em>THX 1138</em>.  Make them comply, and make them believe they are always being watched.  2021 could be a lot more ugly if enough people will rise up and fight this.</p>

        <p>That sums up our government's assault on people's minds nicely. </p>
<p>Start with seemingly minor rules (like the stupid lines and dots on the floor). Allow the rule to become a ritual - you will not have to enforce it very much as the sheep start to self-police each other.</p>
<p>Move on to more restrictive and annoying rules (masks). The acceptance of the previous ones will make most people "go along to get along". Enforce these more strongly, and demonize those who won't comply. The self-policing will become much more "in  your face" as the fear ramps up.</p>
<p>Now you can drop the hammer (lockdowns, rules on gatherings, crushing of dissent), as at this point the sheep will simply go along - their habit of obedience now linked to (in their minds) their very survival. They will now actively attack, confront, and shame those who dissent.</p>
<p>The road to tyranny, 101.</p>
<p>There is one aspect of breaking down the psyche OP doesn't mention in his post, that deserves a line or two - we are seeing it all around us now:</p>
<p>- The imposition of ever more petty, illogical, and irrational rules which are constantly changing (like wearing masks outside, or while going through a drive-through window). This is a classic technique of control and abuse, designed to break down the will by convincing someone that the only way to stop the abuse is to blindly follow every new imposition. Once degraded to this level, the next step is to force one to proclaim, defend, and cheer on the obvious lies and stupidity publicly.</p>
<p>You now have created a herd of automatons - who will burn books, destroy, attack whatever "other" you tell them to, and finally, frog-march the "bad people" onto boxcars.</p>

        <p>&rt;  In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, not to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. </p>

        <p>Well I was one of the first wearing a mask in my area. I was scoffed at in public, even at the doctor's office. As I got more info about what I was dealing with, I dropped that shit fast. </p>
<p>Note: When I DID wear a mask, I washed my hands before putting it on and after taking it off. I only used disposable ones, and changed it frequently. I didn't drop it on the floor and put it back on my face, or ball it up in my car cup holder. I'm not insulting anyone for this. Them mandating masks has created an environment where we have to have it available at all times, so we sometimes sacrifice cleanliness for convenience. I've even had people ask to borrow my mask because they needed to run in a store and needed a mask. This is why I don't agree with mandates. I dropped mine on the bathroom floor (a really bad one) once. I threw it away but how many would have put it back on in despiration?</p>

        <p>This is nonewnormal, what most people here want is a return to actual normalcy. This is not some dry science-sub. So there is an interest here in discussing how to persuade regular people that they should return to normalcy. I think I've presented a strong argument for why masks act as a barrier against persuading people that we should go back to normal. Do you disagree?</p>

        <p>I would say this is the simple answer that Occam’s Razor would call for, not the hundred “Great Reset” posts we have a week.</p>

        <p>The Occam's razor answer is simply that people are scared. Better to be safe than sorry. I know personally I didn't really care about it but then I heard a couple stories about young kids dying of Covid. Then I said fuck this and worked from home for 6 months.</p>

        <p>I would say that’s also a valid reason for the insanity, but that despite how drawn out this post is it also provides an equally concise answer: people are committed to the idea of the vid being an existential threat (perhaps because of months of fear), and are unwilling to renege on that.</p>
<p>While OP spells it out in a much more detailed manner, that doesn’t disqualify it from being a prudent answer to the question. Instead of this being an overly complicated explanation, I would say its simply an equally valid point that can exist as a reasonable counter to your argument. Even then, it may not be a counter but an argument that could complement yours.</p>
