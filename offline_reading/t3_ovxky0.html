    <strong>I'm hoping that many of us are wrong about the vaccine, but it's not looking that way.</strong>
    <p><p>So far, a number of major issues have been identified regarding this vaccine which I believe are outlined well below in the petition written by Dr Wolfgang Wodarg and Dr Michael Yeadon (of course there has been attempts to smear their reputation)</p>
<p>http://imgur.com/a/VdXReL9</p>
<p>Things that alarm me most about the vaccines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blood clotting and micro clotting caused from spike proteins and the irreparable damage to heart and brain tissue. This doctor explains it very well:</li>
</ol>
<p>http://frontlinefiles.com/2021/07/25/canadian-doctor-defies-gag-order/</p>
<p>*note that he says this phenomenon can only occur from the vaccine, not the wild virus, as the wild virus will have a "wall" around the spike protein.</p>
<ol>
<li>Antibody-dependent enhancement. I think this screenshot of a censored post from r/ covidvaccinated (which contains a link to a study) from reveddit summarizes better than I could, but is also outlined in the petition above in section C:8</li>
</ol>
<p>http://imgur.com/a/Uo7wmYa</p>
<p>Now ive heard of these things from many reputable sources, I'm just sharing the links above as a summary but if you go down the rabbit hole you'll find A LOT of censored science. Go to reveddit (where removed posts are stored) if you havent already to get an idea, its terrifying. </p>
<p>Now I'm bringing up these issues as many of my loved ones, and I'm sure yours too, have had the thing. If this information is correct, that means they may not have long to live, and that's a horrifying thought. Is there any verifiable counter evidence to put our minds at ease? (I'm yet to find any and it's quite revealing the fact that info about this is being so heavily censored and that scientists have been shown to be corrupt - see https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis. How do we cope with this thought?</p>
<p>Edit: third link was incorrect, now corrected</p></p>

        <p>All of these concerns about the vaccines also apply to a SARS-CoV-2 infection (even more so; an infection lasts a lot longer than the immune response from the vaccines).  If you use these concerns to avoid getting vaccinated, then you better mask up, social distance, and avoid <em>all</em> exposure to the spike protein, or you'll end up in the same situation you are trying to avoid.</p>

        <p>The virus is actually more risky because the spike protein is actually attached to a virus. Cells aren't destroyed after vaccination because the spike protein is not attached to a virus. Many vaccines also use a prefusion stabilized spike; it is modified before hand so it can't cause the cascading type effects seen with wild type spike protein. Even the vaccines that use wild type spike are very, but not completely safe.</p>

        <p>If this was true, why have there not been blood clots reported as a key symptom of covid? It seems most people just have a cold and are fine. Whereas with vaccines, the spike protein is being injected straight into the blood, and our bodies might not know as well how to cope with it this way, its unnatural after all. And data shows so far that clotting both large and micro has been a serious and worryingly common side effect of the vaccine which would indicate that this so called stabilized spike is not really functioning very well. It's why people are suffering heart damage too. Go to r/covidvaccinated, a lot of those people appear to be experiencing symptoms of clots. I do not remember this in covid forums</p>

        <p>What. Blood clotting <em>is</em> a very well known symptom of Covid. A simple duck duck go search (Google scholar is better) would show you that. Deep vein thrombosis and "Covid toes" are all fairly common effects of the viral infection.</p>

        <p>If young people were getting them from covid at the rate they are from the vaccine, it would of been plastered all over the media. It would apparent that due to the nature of the virus, some clots can occur, but due the the nature of introduction of the vaccine to the body, the vaccines potential for this side effect is much worse. The doctor above said 62% saw clotting following vaccine, I doubt it's that figure for covid infections or it would be obvious by now.</p>

        <p>Having covid once does not make you susceptible to further infections through the function of ADE and taking the vaccine does. Having covid does not increase the risk of a cytokine storm, if this was the case, it would of been mentioned in the petition above. Most people have recovered from covid with zero after effects. It would be interesting to compare the figures with those who've had the vaccine...</p>

        <p>No, both prior Covid infection and vaccination are shown to cause a robust immune response that lessens the likelihood of severe outcomes.. ADE has not been observed with the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the real world. There were some monkey studies but monkeys are not the same as people.  If ADE was actually a feature of the virus, we would see mortality increasing as vaccination increases. We are seeing the opposite.</p>

        <p>No man monkeys are pretty similar to us (isn't it 98.8% DNA we share) and the fact this occurred in them and then this was not demonstrated as safe in humans (try and find a study, you wont) is quite concerning. And I disagree, countries with the highest vaccination rates are seeing the highest rates of infection amd variants. The vaccine could literally be making this worse. The man who discovered HIV agrees:<br>

Remember the Haitain president refused vaccines and had some of the lowest covid deaths in the world. It was business as usual there, no excess deaths. Something is fishy about all this you gotta admit</p>

        <p>Dude the first thing I read on that paper is that it's not peer reviewed so it does not even count, it could be baloney, dont you know most science funded by vested interests is completely false? See replication crisis above. Yes its YouTube but the man speaking is a doctor so youtube can an invaluable source. You can trust words from a man's mouth whos got no stake more than a paper that anyone can tamper with or make up.</p>

        <p>Peer review takes time. Is your YouTube video peer reviewed? No, and it never will be. Do you have a valid critique of the paper I linked other than that it's recent?  No, because it's pretty well done and in all likelihood will be published after peer review. You linked a YouTube video of some doctor, and I linked an actual manifestation of the scientific process at work. I don't even necessarily think you should get vaccinated; my only point is that the SARS-CoV-2 virus exposes the body to spike protein over a much longer period of time. I just want to see people walk the walk. If someone is afraid of spike protein, it only makes sense to avoid the virus, too.</p>

        <p>Yeah for sure. I'm just surprised to see people on this subreddit hate on vaccines so much. I was never a lockdown fan and got vaccinated back in April; I'll admit I was pretty terrified to get vaccinated. To me it seemed like the best way to resume living a normal life was to get vaccinated. This sub used to remind me of the lockdown skepticism one but now it is pretty much just another conspiracy subreddit.</p>

        <p>Yeah I was aware of the risks. I know a person who works on vaccine trials at Fred Hutch in Seattle and they talked to me about all of my concerns (prion, ADE, clotting, GBS) and largely put them to bed. I am not ok with government mandating vaccinations except for other government employees, but I am ok with businesses making a personal choice to deny entry to the unvaccinated. If I had a business I wouldn't do that, but I support the right of other businesses to do what they want.</p>

        <p>Well if they say the prior infected can get this (I think this actually only occurs from the vaccine), than certainly the vaccinated will get it worse as the proteins are injected directly. Also, they say ADE has not happened from the covid vaccine as it would been evident by now, but could it be why so many vaccinated individuals are dying, and this info is being hidden from us and it would be pretty easy as it would certainly look like a covid death. Basically we are screwed lol</p>

        <p>Getting infected exposes you to spike protein much longer than vaccination. I'm serious; it's true. When you get infected the spike protein floods all over your body for weeks and weeks at a time; more spike proteins pop up when the virus replicates.  An extremely small amount of spike from the vaccines circulates in the body.</p>

        <p>If that's the case, why are people having such severe side effects of the vaccines and why are so many vaccinated still being hospitalized and dying? I think it may be the opposite because of how the vaccine is administered and the science is still inconclusive as the vaccines are technically still in trials. I'm interested too, doesn't a virus usually get weaker as it mutates (a truly optimal virus does not want to kill its host)? All of my work came down with the delta variant and they all just had the sniffles and are completely fine. It's a matter of weighing up risks and from what I've seen, I'd rather take my chance with covid as we've had longer to see the effects. I'm just gonna wait out the winter and see what happens first.</p>

As stated, if for one month all sequences are the same lineage (no diversity), then the measure is zeroâ€¦ on the other hand if the sequences are evenly distributed amongst all 1296 lineages, the value is about 7. When a VOC appears, it is labelled a VOC precisely because a large number of cases are seen of that lineage! So, of course, when VOCs begin to dominate the linear entropy decreases.
Figure 1 shows that starting in January 2021, just as alpha becomes dominant, linear entropy begins to decline as expected. January 2021 happens to be the time that mass vaccination gets underway - so it is not clear how much (or if any) of the reduced diversity is due to vaccination.
The second claim in the title (regarding breakthrough infections) is questionable. The sample size is small and no statistical test is presented that supports the claim of greater diversity in the unvaccinated compared to vaccinated.</em></p>
<p>If this is the best you can come up with well then its no better than a YouTube video and at least my guy was experienced and highly accomplished </p>
<p>Anyway thank you for debating with me, very interesting stuff, let's wait and see but theres hope we are wrong I guess but I just want to be sure you know as I do not like to believe a misconception. Remember my opinion comes from many factors regarding this whole covid thing and I do believe there is a possibility the side effects were unintentional and simply unknown. It has been an experiment after all.</p>

        <p>Valid criticism is completely ok; you just seem to completely rely on others' opinions to form your own. I wanted to know what <em>you</em> thought of it, my free thinking debate buddy. Let's hope everything turns out all right. I didn't even mean to come to this subreddit lol; I was on conspiracy and must've accidentally clicked into it on a post there.</p>

        <p>I dont really rely on other peoples opinions as much as the usual type, why would I be on conspiracy of I did! (and trust me you havent met me in person lol). I'm substantiating my opinions with those who agree, this is literally a cornerstone of academic writing and debate. Cant win lol. Anyway welcome to conspiracy good too see you!</p>

        <p>Remember, unlike the "vaxxes", the pathogen is not detached from its spike glycoproteins. The idea that free spikes are the same as those attached to a whole pathogen, is ludicrous.</p>

        <p>Yes, free spikes are nowhere near as harmful as the virus. The vast majority of the "harmful" spike protein effects have to do with enabling the entire viral particle to cause cascading damage.</p>
