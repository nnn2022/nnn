    <strong>No one's listening: some of us live in areas, the oppression has begun and where no one agrees.</strong>
    <p><p>I am realizing speaking out even the few times I have to warn closer friends and a few others, it has not gone well. I've had a couple online friends stop speaking to me. Outside of a few online conspiracy minded friends [2] at this moment everyone buys into the narrative. [husband is supportive]</p>
<p>Even talking to the few people who had bad side effects from the Covid Vaccine was a mistake. I think it may be best to lay low now, though I will continue speaking out online and on my anonymous blog but in person I am wasting my time.</p>
<p>I was even gentle and dealt with only mild details or told people "do your own research" and showed some links. A few times people flat out refused to look. I even had someone who had side effects from the Covid vaccines tell me all the websites showing personal side effects were all fake and they weren't going to look. </p>
<p>Most people think I am crazy even the very little I have shared and I have noticed even if I approach things from the "I have severe autoimmune disease, these experimental vaccines, worry me" that doesn't work either.  </p>
<p>I think at this time in life, it may be best to shut up. I have to think of my safety. It is scary I feel unsafe like this but I do. I don't feel the same about people anymore after Covid. I don't trust others. I found myself having a conversation with husband about "if we have to flee" and what will happen if there is "full blown totalitarianism". That should tell you how messed up things are getting.  </p>
<p>I probably should just go enjoy as much of life as I can while I still have some, even though there's really one person in my life, my husband but I don't think things are going to get any better. </p>
<p>If you have people around you who see through this garbage you are very fortunate. If you live in a state where the majority have refused the vaccine you are very fortunate.  I can't explain the feelings to you all how it feels to be almost deaf with severe autoimmune diseases having people want to shove a kill shot down your throat. I just don't feel the same about people. As an autistic, sadly I wanted connection with others, I think Aspies who don't desire that are better off. </p>
<p>I am done trying to warn anyone now. I have to think of myself and own survival and husband's. I will warn on line and on blog. I figure the system knows I've posted here and other places already.  I know I am already going to be banned now from two groups, for not being vaccinated. People scare me. Some may believe in spiritual darkness or other things to describe all this.</p></p>

        <p>Agree. Don't make my mistake here, folks. If you think they won't listen even to the most gentle non-confrontational way, they probably won't. I hate this society beyond words.</p>

<p>the propaganda is THICK.</p>
<p>I remember a personal conversation I had with Afghani activist Malali Joya. I apologized about how we are so controlled by media in America. Her answer: "That's why I love you guys."</p>

        <p>I think most are brainwashed. seeing people defend all this even after covid vaccines made them sick, has scared the hell out of me. I need to adjust expectations. I don't know why I was born into such a horrible world. People are totally controlled by the propaganda, both right and left, lies for every demographic.</p>

        <p>I understand what you’re feeling.  At this point I’m just keeping my opinions to myself and my close friends as I don’t see it as beneficial to let the stasi know where I stand.  Keep the ones you love close to you and listen to your intuition.  Stay strong!</p>

        <p>Yeah keep opinions to yourself. I think I talked too much even though it was very few people. It's a scary place to be knowing your real opinions could have you lose most friends and associates. The less the stasi knows the better off we all are. People can't be trusted now.</p>
