    <strong>Went for a walk in a park today...95% of people are wearing masks</strong>
    <p><p>I .... don’t get it?? Every adult is eligible to get a vaccine by now and the at risk people have certainly gotten theirs already. It’s a beautiful day and warm outside. So why is everyone (28 out of 30 people I see) masked up? It’s not the law to wear masks outside, so they’re doing it by choice. Which leads to the question — Are they really that scared, even with the vaccine? Do they simply enjoy not feeling the sun on their face? Is it virtue signaling or peer pressure? I’m confused. I used to love going to the park but now I have anxiety that someone is going to confront me. (I already have social anxiety that I’m walking weird so add this to the list)</p>
<p>Bonus - as I’ve walked past people I’ve overheard quite a few conversations about the vaccine. (All about the wisdom of getting it or appointment eligibility) So far it’s at 4 out of 5 total convos are about the vaccine. :/</p></p>

        <p>Here's my theory: I think that people have been put through a massive amount of trauma, stress and psychological manipulation over the last year. They want it to be over just as much as you and I. But as the contradictions in the narrative keep appearing, and what's actually happening in the world doesn't make sense with what they've been told, they are actually subconsciously doubling down on their beliefs (wearing 2 masks, masks outdoors, getting angry at people who don't comply) because that is now how they feel safe. The alternative is to face that they have been lied to, and that's too scary/painful to face, so they push harder and their actions show that they are more scared now.</p>
<p>I see more people masked up here outside, just as most of the vulnerable are now getting vaccinated.</p>

        <p>That's exactly it. What's expected of them keeps changing. They'd rather just keep it on because they aren't confident that they are allowed to take it off. Because there is still a divide. I've found that it also depends on people's personality type. Some people do not wanna be viewed as breaking the rules at all. Others do the opposite nomatter what just to piss people off. Then there's the catagory I fall into. I question the government and don't wish to comply with what I know are lies are being told, but I care about the average citizen and don't want to take it out on them. I have a problem with the system, not the individual.</p>

        <p>Don’t be afraid. I am in a liberal city and never wear a mask outside. I get confronted maybe once every month. It sucks but it’s almost always a woman who, from afar, looks like they love NPR and hate trump. They’re easy to spot. And they’re miserable usually so you have to forgive them for being nasty. Don’t be afraid!!! Not wearing masks is how we get out of this mess</p>

        <p>I could care less if I have to look at them, personally. I just don’t want to wear one.</p>
<p>I’m way more worried about all the shit going on with the vaccines than masks at this point honestly. They’re just dumb and annoying. I can still take it off whenever I want, the vaccine I could never get out of my body if I were forced to take it.</p>

        <p>I get it. You better believe if I have to choose either to keep wearing the mask or get the vaccine, I'll just keep wearing the mask. But I try to reject both.</p>

        <p>Same here. I only wear the mask when I have to, but if it comes down to a choice of mask vs. vaccine it’s a no brainer if you ask me.</p>

        <p>Sad. Our oligarchs just banned all indoor dining (to nerf Easter brunch), and every place I’ve driven by with outdoor seating every chair is occupied and no one is masked. The tables are legally social distanced but the chairs at each table are not. Now we just have to get the businesses catering to their customers instead of the government. </p>
<p>Also maybe 5% of people walking around the city have their mask pulled up. Either it’s on their chin or off completely. But as soon as they step into a store it’s on because big brother said they have to. The estrogen in our food has really done a number on people’s spines.</p>
