    <strong>Does the covid jab a soul trap?</strong>
    <p><p>Saw a post on another sub about a dude who got so high that he saw “the wheel of life” in a higher dimension with machine elves. and he saw how malevolent beings in control of things want to restrict souls and keep recycling them. Some theorize that the jab is a new way of them permanently taking your soul. Instead of recycling your soul every roughly 80 years in between lives, they now have it forever. Thought?</p></p>

        <p>I truly believe this jab was designed in an attempt to suppress humanity's link to their spiritual/astral body, or higher self/soul group. I believe this has been done in their silly pathetic attempts to fight against the mass awakenings that have been ongoing in our current evolutions. </p>
<p>I don't believe that this jab will enable them to permanently take our souls, but rather to attempt to inhibit our physical bodies connection to our souls. They are trying to sever the cord. </p>
<p>Humanity is at its greatest threat to these malevolent controllers when we are able to easily connect with our etheric bodies, soul group, spiritual guardians/guides, and Source of All Creation. I do continue to believe that despite all their pathetic attempts, they will not be able to permanently take our souls. Even in those who have been severely brainwashed who so willingly get these jabs and promote the propaganda, this bioweapon and jab won't succeed their fucked up mission.</p>
<p>I choose to keep anchoring these truths because it is what my soul continues to speak to me - that even with these biochemical weapons and nefarious experimental gene therapies forced upon the masses from the controllers - it will never fully suppress Humanity from connecting with, and embodying their Spiritual selves. Nor will they be able to permanently take our souls. </p>

<p>...facking hell...sorry for rambling so much. lol. I hope you get the gist of what I'm saying.</p>

        <p>I'm watching an interview with a very intellectual, old and well-read man. He's very knowledgable on a lot of things. He was an anthropologist, he knows a lot about philosophy, worked in the field, has read a lot of old manuscripts, books, documents, texts. In the interview, he's talking about many things, about how humans are supposed to be wise, spiritual beings for example, but more importantly, he mentioned the zodiac. The belt that keeps mankind trapped, enslaved here. It being kept in place by dark forces or creatures. I couldn't properly summarise it even if I wanted to, let alone translate everything perfectly, but it resonates well with what you mention in this post. </p>
<p>I don't know what's true or false, but I think it's interesting that you mentioned something incredibly similar.</p>

        <p>I think you need to read less mumbo jumbo and more real theology. Nothing good comes of getting high—and certainly not the truth. If that guy did see anything beyond hallucinations, it was certainly demonic in nature and shouldn’t be believed (not that you should believe hallucinations, either). </p>
<p>Either that, or you’re a really strange sort of troll. If so, congratulations, you’ve certainly managed to confuse me, at least.</p>

<p>No, the science isn’t perfect, but most people working on it are doing the best they can to get us out of this mess. </p>
<p>There are no fairies, there are no soul elves, and there are no vaccine microchips. The world we made allows it to travel so quickly and be so dangerous. Now we have to change our world until it’s dealt with, simple as.</p>

        <p>I do get your point but we can only see a tiny % of what is really there. It is actually more likely that there is a shit load of stuff going on around us that we can't even comprehend. So to brush it all off as junkies etc isn't really fair. </p>
<p>There are litterally millions and millions of accounts across the world which suggest there is far more than meets the eye. </p>
<p>Being a tiny bit more open to it could be helpful.

        <p>I agree that we should be open to different ideas, and there definitely is a lot that science can’t explain yet, or may not ever be able to explain. </p>
<p>My issue is that we shouldn’t hold anecdotal evidence as highly, or as some people here seem to do, MORE highly than evidence from peer reviewed scientific studies. We certainly shouldn’t use these guesses (because that’s what they are) to direct us in the face of a virus that is taking lives daily.</p>
