        <p>CNN's really scaling back on the fear mongering already, which I find a little surprising even given the new administration. Are they really going to hold back on saying people "died with Covid-19" or "died of suspected Covid-19" before Biden has his 100 days to save everyone from the virus? 🤔</p>

        <p>First they have to present the narrative that orange Hitler caused the crisis.  The current leftwing strategy of actual facism (lockdowns and mandates) solved Covid-19. This will cement the lie in the publics mind.  Another summer of relative freedom as a reward for accepting the lie.</p>

<p>Why though. Why would the elites do this "for control"? They already have all the power they can need. Why make the public so discontent? What do they even <em>gain</em> from having people indoors 24/7? You'll just get another debacle over stimulus checks and everyone will hate the government even more. It's absolutely pointless, whereas this pandemic was clearly orchestrated for the Great Reset</p>

        <p>Why don't you read the book? Total societal control is needed to fully implement the Great Reset, many of the concepts can't go forward with pesky things like human rights, privacy laws and freedoms.  This round was a priming and removing of some obstacles.  You can't go too quickly or the population will rebel. A huge amount of progress was made and society largely accepted and encouraged the actions. We are well on our way but they need to regroup or risk too much opposition.</p>

        <p>My take is this: that certain class of people who control Hollywood have purposely given us a perception of "dystopia" i.e. what you just described. That's a diversion. That kind of cyberpunk-totalitarian world is seeded into our minds as the symbol of "no freedom", so we then look to our own world and feel like we're free. But we aren't.  </p>
<p>They already control the flow of money through banks so they already control literally everything. It's just a matter of taking away your property and/or bank account if you oppose them (which, as we speak, they are working on making more socially acceptable). You don't need military personnel in the streets or any of that. It's unnecessary with our level of technology.  </p>
<p>The Great Reset as they describe it is over-promising and will under-deliver. Things will get worse, but it won't be the bizarre cashless society they envision. They don't <em>need</em> all of that to complete their agenda, and they're not gonna brute-force it through just for the hell of it. The intent is to prime our minds for new "innovation" but only to make enough wiggle room for the bare necessities.</p>

        <p>The elites at the top, many of whom operate out of the spotlight, are secretly practicing Luciferian pedophile cultists. They want massive depopulation with the surviving population made into helpless slaves whom they can exploit to fulfill all their needs, from practical to horrifically sadistic, without fear of repercussion. In their view, "The Hunger Games" wasn't a cautionary tale, but a goal. Sounds crazy until you look into it and see the mountains of evidence hidden in plain sight. Luciferian symbolism is everywhere, from the Pope's Audience Hall to the disturbing Gotthard Tunnel opening ceremony, attended by world leaders, to popular culture to corporate logos. A good intro for those new to this is "Out of Shadows Official" on YouTube, which, while very disturbing, only scratches the surface.</p>

        <p>I think frankly it's just ruled by J3wz who wanna sit at the top with their huge stacks of money while everyone else sees their life get progressively worse. A lot of these crazy conspiracies about satanism are seeded by either the CIA or Mossad and their purpose is to make anyone who questions J3wish power look no different from a tinfoil hat conspiracy nut. QAnon is an example of this. None of the Q predictions are real and their purpose is to divert skeptics from the people who are actually pulling the strings.  </p>
<p>The elites know about the Streisand Effect and all that reverse psychology stuff. That's why they made Q. By expressing all this "concern" about QAnon "radicalization" and what have you, logical and well-meaning individuals come to the conclusion that Q is indeed legitimate, so they go down the rabbithole.  </p>
<p>That being said there definitely is pedophilia shit going on, but it's exaggerated for the purpose of making us look crazy. It's more likely that they're hosting the elites at parties and secretly recording their interactions with teenaged prostitutes. These recordings are then used for blackmail.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I always liked Larry King. Grew up watching his interviews. I'm sad he died and had so many health problems. I mean, there are people in their 90s who survive covid just fine, I dont think that was the main reason he died and I think his failing health just finally got him.</p>

        <p>I thought I remembered reading that he recovered and returned home and was no longer battling covid? I might be wrong but in our local news, they reported the death as unknown pending investigation. It could be anything and I’m sure we will find out. I don’t think they would purposely hide that information, but it’s an added info to note.</p>

        <p>So, you are saying that CNN would have a headline "Larry King dies of Covid" when they don't have any medical report to source that claims that?  Anyway he was in ICU but he recovered and was transferred out of ICU on Jan 4th.  Meaning he did actually survive the initial Covid attack.  </p>
<p>Anyway I find it funny that first it was that 87 year baseball player that got the Covid vaccine, and thus of course it's implied here that he died of the vaccine.  Now it's CNN hiding the fact that Larry King died of Covid because Biden is President, according to this sub.  </p>
<p>The United States still has about 3,500 deaths a day from Covid.  Thanks to your lord and traitor Trump.</p>

        <p>Two bullshit loaded questions based on bullshit talking points.</p>
<p>Trump’s policy lead to escalation of conflicts worldwide, he escalated our use of the drone strike program, and sold as much military hardware to other countries like Saudi Arabia to outsource conflicts as he could possibly get away with.</p>
<p>Second the lockdowns haven’t led to mass unemployment, lots of countries locked down much harder and have much less unemployment. US has hardly had lockdowns and is doing much worse economically than countries with stronger lockdowns. This is because the virus is destroying our economy, not lockdowns. The former president’s failure to develop an effective national strategy to combat the virus, like other countries who are effectively combatting the virus AND mitigating the economic damage is why we are in this position.</p>

        <p>Trump almost got us into a few different wars.  There's <em>two</em> warrants for his arrest and a few different bounties as well. </p>
<p>Speaking of bounties, he lied about knowing that Russia had bounties on our own military.</p>
<p>Not to mention one of his executive orders was that officials no longer have to <em>report</em> drone strikes publicly so accountability is pretty low.</p>

        <p>Oh <em>almost</em>, yeah that's totally the same. Here's the thing, I have alway been against these wars. I voted against Bush because he got us into them and for Obama because he <em>said</em> he would get us out. Only Trump made solid motions to get us out and he was met with resistance and lies at every turn. Will you still be against the war when it's your guy in the Whitehouse? I know I was.</p>
