        <p>The death toll from this vaccine is higher than the death toll from ALL vaccines during a 15 year period!  That should scare the hell out of people!  Plus the fact that none of these manufacturers will be held accountable!  Why would anyone get this vaccine that has zero track record?</p>

        <p>I'm assuming this "fact" is coming from VAERS data.  VAERS data SHOULD NOT be used to assume a vaccine caused the death.</p>
<p>VAERS: https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html</p>
<p>From their disclaimer (see site for full; emphasis mine):
&rt; VAERS accepts reports of adverse events and reactions that occur following vaccination. Healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to the system. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, <strong>VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. In large part, reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind.</strong></p>
<p>Anyway... I'm assuming VAERS data was used to backup your "fact" because when I pull info from the site, for deaths filtered by covid vaccinations it returns 3,252 deaths reported.  When I select all deaths for vaccines other than covid, from 2005 to 2021, I get 3,164.</p>
<p>But again: there are severe limitations to how one can use VAERS data and it does NOT imply the vaccine has caused that many deaths.</p>
<p>Tucker Carlson tried to use VAERS data to make similar claims about a high death rate, and that claim has been analyzed here: https://factcheck.afp.com/tucker-carlson-misrepresents-government-data-covid-19-vaccines</p>
<p>I especially would like to note that relevant to this claim of "more deaths than all other vaccines over 15 years" is this important detail (lifted from the factcheck page):</p>
<p>&rt; Carlson also compared the number of deaths reported to VAERS that followed Covid-19 vaccinations with those that came after flu shots, which are far lower.
&rt;
&rt; But the CDC previously said that deaths following Covid-19 vaccinations must be reported, while those that come after other immunizations do not.
&rt;
&rt;There is a “requirement that health care providers report all deaths that occur after Covid-19 vaccination (required by the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)), regardless of whether the health care provider believes the vaccine was the cause,” the CDC said, referring to the authorizations allowing the shots to be administered.
&rt;
&rt;“This reporting requirement does not apply to other vaccines.”</p>

        <p>&rt;And thus, the reported deaths from all other vaccines are higher than the reported deaths from the covid vaccine.</p>
<p>Wait what?  That's the opposite of your initial post and not what VAERS "claims."</p>
<p>None of this is to support your original claim:
&rt; The death toll from this vaccine is higher than the death toll from ALL vaccines during a 15 year period!</p>
<p>Because that original claim is based off VAERS, but <strong>VAERS data does not indicate death rate actually caused by a vaccine and should not be used to draw such conclusions</strong>.</p>
<p>The CDC is currently requiring healthcare professionals to report ANY death after a vaccine to VAERS, even if it doesn't seem to the healthcare provider to be caused by the vaccine.  It does not levy this requirement on other vaccines.</p>
<p>Some people are naturally going to die (due to other reasons) after getting the vaccine - that's life. Any such reported deaths to VAERS are followed up on to try and determine if the deaths are linked to the vaccinations.</p>
<p>https://factcheck.afp.com/covid-19-shots-not-found-have-caused-deaths-followed-vaccinations</p>
<p>&rt;A CDC webpage says that, from December 14, 2020 through April 12, 2021, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) “received 3,005 reports of death... among people who received a Covid-19 vaccine.”
&rt;
&rt;But it adds: “A review of available clinical information including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths.”
&rt;
&rt; ...
&rt; 
&rt;The CDC, which runs the VAERS program with the Food and Drug Administration, previously told AFP that the system “accepts all reports of adverse events after vaccination, without regard to whether or not the vaccine caused the event.”
&rt;
&rt;“Because of this and other limitations, data in VAERS generally can’t be used to determine if a vaccine caused the adverse event (including deaths),” it said.</p>

<p>The reasons I have seen seem to vary from person to person (as expected) Stubbornness. Concerns about the science. Distrust of the messaging or authority, believing that your doing this or not doing this has no impact on others - that it is a personal choice. Believing that the Covid thing is blown out of proportion. That it is being leveraged by powerful bad actors to exert more control on a nation’s people. </p>
<p>Most of the things that I find are helpful in convincing folks I can’t offer. I don’t have many great stories about the personal impact of the virus. And I’m not your doctor that you know and trust. </p>
<p>There are things I’ll come in to these subreddits and debate. Partially because I believe strongly, but more because I feel like I will learn something in the process. </p>
<p>This vaccine stuff is not that. I don’t think you have any information which would sway me, and I doubt I have any information that would sway you.</p>

        <p>When people share their personal (anecdotal) sob stories, it just makes me laugh. The idea that they think I'd be swayed by how their 90-year-old gam gam who had terminal cancer and was already on death's door died "cuz covid" is such a funny punchline. In a thousand years, when I've faked my own death for the dozenth time, I'll have to put "ded of coof" on my tombstone on Gygax 7.</p>

        <p>Don’t know what to tell you, it’s certainly less deadly to those that are younger, but it’s not like it only kills grandma’s who were flirting with the reaper regardless. </p>
<p>And I know you know that. But I know you know that many folks have died who would be here today if it were not for the virus.</p>

        <p>No, I actually don't "know" that they would be here. Nor do I care.  But here, tell yea what: I do know that I wish my grandpa had caught it and ended up with a fatal complication already, though. He's got extreme dementia, has no fucking idea who he is or who any of his children are, and would 100% be better off dead. But no, he's still there, alone, unable to visit anyone (even though he has no idea who they are anyway), an empty shell, draining resources, knowing only misery in the void of what remains of his own mind.  </p>
<p>The coof simply burned through the fuel supply (old and already ill). Now it's got nothing left. It's not killing people who are already healthy. Sounds to me like my theory that the Chinese produced it specifically to kill of their own elderly and sick people actually makes a lot of sense!</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear about you  grandpa. That sucks, regardless. It hurts to see a family member water away like that. </p>
<p>I think there were probably easier ways for such a goal to be accomplished in China if that was their plan.  I mean, they are close to a dictatorship. </p>
<p>That said, they have great respect for their elderly, if I understand Confucianism correctly.</p>

        <p>Tucker Carlson is a dumb dickbag.</p>
<p>The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) was created in 1990 with the goal of detecting possible safety issues with vaccines licensed in the U.S. It is co-managed by the CDC and FDA.</p>
<p>Health care professionals must report certain adverse effects, such as death, hospitalization or a congenital anomaly, and vaccine manufacturers must report all known adverse events. Any individual can report an adverse health effect to VAERS. Reports made by people may be unverifiable and may not be accurate.</p>
<p>“The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable,” according to the VAERS website. “In large part, reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically.”</p>
<p>The limitations of the reporting system means VAERS doesn’t determine if a vaccine caused a health problem. That’s where the CDC comes in.</p>
<p>The CDC said the FDA requires vaccine providers to report anyone who died after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine to VAERS. Just because a death is reported doesn’t mean the vaccine caused the death, the CDC notes. The CDC said it then investigates the report “to determine whether the death was a result of the vaccine or unrelated.”</p>
<p>From Dec. 14, 2020, through April 12, 2021, there were 3,005 reports of people who had died after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the CDC. The CDC says it has found no evidence the COVID-19 vaccines contributed to those deaths.</p>

<p>Ohhh Ok, that makes sense. So like at the beginning, whenever someone was 81 years old, obese, and had a gun shot wound but tested positive for Covid, it's a Covid death. </p>
<p>But now it's like that for the vaccine, but the opposite! Thanks for setting that straight.</p>

        <p>Exactly. It should be consistent. If you weren't showing major symptoms of what you died from, then die of that within 2 weeks of testing positive for COVID or taking the vaccine then it should be marked as a COVID or vaccine death respectively. Or neither should apply.</p>

        <p>Yep. And people are saying I intended to support killing them, which I don’t. They need to be stopped somehow and without violence. Ironic though, those people- like on r/politics- openly talk about exterminating us and those groups have done exactly that before, but we are unable to say anything even appearing to support violence?

        <p>Fuck the high road. These dumbasses will track you down online and try to get you fired from your job and for the most part are the same people rioting in the streets, killing people, and destroying property. I won’t be nice to them, and they won’t have my mercy when it comes to the real world. They will answer for their sins.</p>

        <p>Lol you state direct evidence that the vaccines are very dangerous and haven’t refuted anyone here, but then you say you only think they’re safe because the CDC says so, after they lied about everything for over a year. Do you realize the error in your logic?</p>

        <p>"The CDC says it has found no evidence the COVID-19 vaccines contributed to those deaths." </p>
<p>What would that evidence look like? Does "science" have a test to determine whether or not a death was caused by the vaccine? This is what I don't understand about them "finding no evidence" what evidence are they looking for? Of course they don't have evidence. We didn't have evidence that the earth revolved around the sun until we did. The truth is that people who were otherwise healthy have been injured and have died immediately following these injections.</p>

<p>LMFAO. You have no idea what it's like to get seriously sick from a vaccine. 90 to 99 percent of vaccine reactions go unreported.</p>
<p>As for VAERS, it's total shit, but that is the scrap we have been thrown from the corporate lap dogs to shield drug makers. If a system like VAERS was used for anything else it would be treated like the joke it is.</p>

        <p>There is good science being done, it's just a minority of the total scientific literature. The scientific method is quite rigorous and people should take it upon themselves to check the rigor of a scientific claim. There are countless headlines in the media based on nothing but speculation or surveys (like the weekly claims of eggs being unhealthy funded by processed food corporations). A large chunk of modern "science" is really closer to the field of marketing.</p>

        <p>Trusting science means trusting the scientific method. Run an experiment and use the results as evidence. If you disagree with that claim you need to beat it with equal or greater evidence. Your "gut" doesn't beat 3 phase double blinded randomized control trials...</p>

        <p>The fuck are you talking about, you can research exactly what the scientists say, get a degree, and learn the facts, but instead you sit on your ass and complain because you don’t understand. You guys are the people that don’t want education to cost less right? So you guys feed into this notion that science is something where people hoard their knowledge.</p>

        <p>I absolutely believe in proper science. "Science" and "The Science" cult are not the same thing. I do my research, I look into things on my own, and it's actually relatively easy to do so, degree or no degree. Simply having a degree doesn't automatically make someone infallible. People with degrees can lie and cheat just as well as anyone else, and incentives to do so exist throughout every industry.</p>
<p>Not sure why you brought education costs in to it. Sounds like an axe you have to grind. Find some other sap to listen to that sob story. I don't care.</p>
<p>People who go around spouting nonsense like "THE SCIENCE IS SETTLED!" fundamentally do not understand how science works, conceptually. First, there is no monolith called "THE SCIENCE" to begin with. If you were to try to assign some kind of physical embodiment to the "idea" of science, I'd go with something like the World Tree, Yggdrasil, from Norse Mythology. But as interesting an idea as that might be, it's really getting off the rails.</p>
<p>You can't just run around twittering about how "the science" is "settled" and expect everyone to nod and agree. That's literally the fucking opposite of what you're whining about here (hee haw durr get yuh degree then go out n do learnding"). That's supremely childish. What "science", exactly? And what is "settled" about it? Evidently, since discussions are still ongoing within the actual scientific community, constantly, it seems obvious that nothing is ever "settled". Just because one side makes unilateral declarations that something is "settled", absolutely does not mean than anything is actually settled. That's akin to a child taking his basketball, declaring the game over, and going home, then telling his family (echo chamber) that he won the game.</p>
<p>This is why I liken it to clergymen hoarding books in the Dark Ages. Because people like you, unwittingly colluding with the media and corrupt/compromised members of the scientific community, are gaslighting people into believing your cultish dogma without doing their own due diligence. And whenever someone actually does go out and find the information on their own, and disagrees with you, you become enraged and start furiously hurling out accusations of things like "science deniers!" and "conspiracy theorists!", which sound to me like equivalents to things like "blasphemers!" and "heretics!"</p>
<p>Anyone who truly believes in science, knows full well that it is never "settled". It is always evolving. We use science as a tool to learn and grow, not to force people to kneel and grovel.</p>

        <p>Trusting science <em>as a process</em> is valid, when you do it and get results. People aren't running PCR tests in their basements, so what the statement really means is "Trust Other People." People can lie, or have ulterior motives.</p>

        <p>It's really rare to see anyone understand that science is a process and not an ideology. Even among "doctors". I had to explain to a stupid teacher acquaintance recently that there is no "settled science" and that science can only draw inferences about reality into models and theories and then attempt to disprove them. The average person actually thinks science is some sort of rigid cult where you have to adopt certain beliefs or you are "unscientific".</p>

        <p>Exactly. We can't even prove that the "laws of physics" are self-consistent or will behave the same in other parts of the universe or at other times (problem of induction + can't prove a negative). Science as a process is the best that we have <em>primarily</em> because it's an antagonistic process which recognizes that people have an easier time defending their ideas than disproving them. Trying to disprove rather than prove ideas is the critical part.</p>

        <p>You're the idiot because you cannot grasp what science actually is. You believe it to be a cult of consensus rather than a process. We know the earth is 4.6mill years old not because a consensus of scientists say it is, but because of various geological dating methods independently verified by experimentation that has so far not falsified the theory. If further experimentation did find flaws in dating methods, then the age of the earth would likely change, and it has changed several times, each time discrediting the contemporary consensus.</p>
<p>Science has nothing to do with consensus, or appeals to authority, or what mainstream media thinks. In fact the scientific cutting edge is often at odds with popular science. Midwits like you think science is about believing wholesale in whatever package of views are most popular at any given time. That is unscientific at best, and at worst it makes you suscpetible to propaganda as we are seeing now with your religious dedication to vaccine pseudo-science.</p>

        <p>Science as a process admits of two states for any (self-consistent) assertion: disproven and not-yet-disproven, there is no proven. What people call proven is just "we have tried our best and have run out of ideas on how to disprove this." While we can treat that as functionally true, it's not the same thing as being 100% correspondent to reality in all times and places.</p>
<p>Science as a process is built on top of philosophy. If that seems squishy, it is. It is subject to all the questions about epistemology and solipsism, and whether the universe is self-consistent.</p>

        <p>That stresses the importance of peer reviewed data. Multiple unaffiliated centers doing their own data collection on vaccines and comparing results. If you're gonna question a 3 phase double blinded randomized control trial, it takes more than a gut feeling to be taken seriously.</p>

        <p>Trust the science is gaslighting. They are trying to paint you as unreasonable and crazy because you are actually thinking. This is a tactic to keep you questioning your own opinion until you doubt yourself enough to convert to their opinion.</p>

        <p>Pretty much this. I had a doomer tell me (early on in the GlObAl PaNdEmIc) that he was disappointed at how unreasonable I was being for refusing to get the "vaccine". Then he went on a bs spiel about how she have to "trust the science" or "believe in the science" because it's not our place to question it. It questions itself (he literally said that) but he kept denying this had anything to do with religion when I pointed out how a lot of people (he included) were treating science as their new religion. Then he kept either asking whether I believe in science (or what do I believe in if I don't) or repeating how we should believe in science because he does.</p>
<p>I think it morphed into a cult at this point.</p>

        <p>the instant i saw a sign about 8 months ago that said "we believe in science, we believe love is love...we believe water is life" it was a gutpunch because its literally saying there is one science and if you dont believe it, your a complete moron and not in our club.  i asked my daughter why everyone in her neighborhood had those signs. she said someone just brought a pallet of them in and told people to take them. </p>
<p>i wanted to come back to that area and pull out every single one of those brainwashing propaganda signs out.  it was the beginning of the hivemind and i knew right then that things were getting very wierd.</p>

        <p>I have a question as you seem legit.  Have we ever had a rmna vaccine before this for human besides trials?   And from my understanding,  most animals in previous studies perishes by 15 month although I have not verified that.</p>
<p>Also, what do you think about the lie of the 95% effective vs the real absolute of 19% for pfizer? Basically control group was 162 out of 22000 and the vaccine group was 8 out of 22000 . The real risk decrease would then be 19%.  Is this normal for how they report this?</p>

        <p>Hey thanks for the question. This is the first time humans have used mRNA vaccines which is why I was extremely hesitant of that platform until all clinical trials were complete. My boss was on the FDA panel to green light the vax and he and I both were quite skeptical. </p>
<p>Regarding the data you ask, if you could provide me a source for the 19% so I can address your question. The 95% is efficacy, often misreported as efficiency. Where efficacy is compared to controls in a tight environment. Efficacy and efficiency are not always tightly related; you can judge efficiency by the question you’re asking (reduction in disease, death, hospitalization, transmission, etc.) so it can be a loaded term.</p>

        <p>Glad to hear you are also hesitant with the rush.  That is my main concern that not having long term results before rolling it out to an entire population, especially a brand new type that has never been used before.  I have also been reading about the risk of leaky vaccines and that scares the hell out of me.  Do you think that could be aiding the new variants that they keep talking about?</p>
<p>As for the 19%, it was the calculation in the article I posted.  I hope to continue this conversation with your reply as it is rare to have a objective conversation anywhere these days. 
 Here is the snippet:</p>
<p>"Absolute risk, simply explained, is “the likelihood that an outcome will occur.” Relative risk “compares the risk of a health event … among one group with the risk among another group.”</p>
<p>Pfizer told the FDA that eight (of approximately 22,000) volunteers in its vaccine group developed a PCR-confirmed case of COVID-19, versus 162 of 22,000 volunteers in the placebo group. Moderna reported a similar spread — five out of 15,000 in the vaccine group versus 90 out of 15,000 in the placebo group.</p>
<p>When one does the math, the Pfizer clinical trial numbers showed: “The risk reduction in absolute terms [was] only 0.7%, from an already very low risk of 0.74% [in the placebo group] to a minimal risk of 0.04% [in the vaccine group].” (Dividing 0.7 — the difference between the two groups — by 0.74 is the mathematical calculation that produced the touted “95% effective” number).</p>
<p>Although the eight versus 162 PCR-confirmed COVID cases in the Pfizer trial may sound like a big difference to the casual reader, Peter Doshi subsequently alerted the public to the fact that Pfizer skewed its analysis by excluding more than 3,400 individuals with non-PCR-confirmed symptoms of COVID — individuals split almost evenly across the vaccine and placebo groups.</p>
<p>As Doshi wrote in The BMJ: “With 20 times more suspected than confirmed cases, this category of disease cannot be ignored simply because there was no positive PCR test result. Indeed this makes it all the more urgent to understand.”</p>
<p>Factoring in both the suspected and confirmed cases, Doshi noted, would drop the 95% relative risk figure down to 19%.</p>
<p>In 2019, the author of a pre-COVID paper, “How to Communicate Evidence to Patients” (quoted in a post-COVID blog), explained that relative risks “can exaggerate the perception of difference” between groups — especially, as in the case of COVID vaccines and many other medical interventions, “when the absolute risks are very small.”</p>
<p>Other researchers agree the concealment of “underlying absolute risks” (and the tendency to “overestimate” effects presented in relative terms) are a “major weakness” of relative risk data. For these reasons, many researchers insist that one risk measure “cannot be interpreted without the other.”"</p>

<p>He makes a great statement here. I should qualify my expertise before I give anymore opinion. I am a bench scientist, not a policy guy, quite frankly that shit is so boring and not for me. We do all this science and then people still stuff their face with cigs booze and McDonald’s all the while mad at big pharma or whatever for hiding the cure for cancer. So I’m a science bitch through and through. People make their own choices and I’d rather know about nerd shit like how certain cytokines modulate other cells than figure out what percentage of fat people will consider jogging, ya know? </p>
<p>Working in antivirals for a similar virus, RSV, I was at a conference where we discussed the relative v absolute risk. Long story short, relative risk came out to be the best way to present data in the context of how well a certain intervention works. From a science communication standpoint, this is confusing to translate to laypeople, but I still think it’s the most appropriate way to discuss countermeasures however as you note, context is important. I think good arguments can be made for presenting either relative and absolute risk. </p>
<p>It would seem based on Doshi’s claim that Pfizer trials were not as robust, as certain data weren’t available in the larger studies (smaller ones looked at antibodies, T cells, and other subsets to address certain questions). I would imagine their endpoints required some sort of confirmatory assay and not just symptoms, as myriad of other things cause mild CoVID disease. PCR, with all its flaws, is the best to work with what we got at this moment in time. So it was probably less about fudging data and more about working within the confines of the environment. </p>
<p>With regard to safety, most vaccine SAEs occur within days of vaccination, if not hours (ie anaphylaxis, seizure, etc). Long term side effects in vaccines are really not relevant except the only example I can think is a bad batch of polio vaccines gave people cancer back in the 60s(?). So with respect to safety, I don’t think there’s an issue. I’m also not familiar with vaccine leakage, if you could explain that I’d be happy to give you my thoughts. I don’t think vaccines are putting pressure on CoVID to mutate. The virus can mutate in each new infected person, in each cell within that person. For example, the B117 variant was found using deep sequencing in the original Washington state patient, however we report viral genomes (and other genomes) as a “consensus”, so minor populations of mutated viruses get ignored during that process unless you use super computing and a whole lot of money to analyze each infected cell collected. Long story short, doubt the vax is causing mutations any more or less than wild type virus is.</p>

        <p>The way you calculate how effective the vaccine is with comparing the people who were infected in the control group. You don't use the 22000 figure because they didn't catch covid with or without the vaccine. </p>
<p>If you had 162 people infected in the control group and 162 people infected in the vaccine group the vaccine isn't 1% effective, it's 0% effective, because there's no difference. </p>
<p>If you have 8 people infected in the vaccine group that is a 95% reduction of the people who were infected in that population.</p>

        <p>They're suspected not confirmed so they were excluded, there's no solid data about these people having covid so how can you use them in your analysis? the rate of false negatives for covid PCR tests is very low so it's unlikely these people were infected.</p>

        <p>Well then how can you say they should be part of the analysis? Use the ones that were tested and we know about. Which show the vaccine is 95% effective.</p>

        <p>It’s mRNA on a carrier lipid particle. mRNA is translated into viral protein (spike protein, specifically). The cell then uses that spike protein within the cell to present it to certain immune cells so they can produce antibodies directed against that protein, through a complex system of antibody production. </p>
<p>DNA isn’t in the vaccine. It doesn’t attach to host DNA (not sure what that would even look like or how that would work). And there are a handful of vaccine technologies- Live attenuated is one indeed, as is mRNA/nucleic acid vaccines, and others.</p>

        <p>Hence my terminology "broken DNA". It's fragmented. It actually penetrates the cells and forces it to respond in a specific way. (tho were finding out it doesn't do what it's intended to do) Mrna vaccines are basically a software update for the immune system with as of yet unknown long term effects. You're explanation is not only lacking but dangerous as it implies the process is simpler than it really is.</p>

        <p>Broken DNA is completely wrong. It’s a complete messenger RNA transcript of the spike protein. Ribosomes inside your cell translate it into the protein form of the spike protein. This protein is then presented to your immune system to mount a response. This is the basic central dogma of molecular biology at work here. It’s a very simple but very powerful concept.</p>

        <p>It's busted DNA, that's how they make it lol jeebus the fact you claim to be working in a scientific field is enough for me to be wary of this. They literally break down DNA (your body wouldn't accept it otherwise) then attach the rna messenger to that. I'm done with you shills. It's easy to spot you cause no-one else swarms comments like you.</p>

        <p>K the reason they use fetal tissue to develop the mrna is because they need compatible dna to trick the human immune system into accepting it. It's not just the spike protein as your dancing around with but won't commit to what the product actually is. Its frankensteinein combinations of rna and partial DNA strands created from fetal tissue bypassing the normal functions of 2 billion years of evolution.</p>
<p>Btw yours is just gibberish that's more widespread. You literally understand nothing of what your spouting. Scripted almost.</p>

        <p>I don’t know what else to say.. you honestly have no idea what you’re talking about. The vaccines were tested on fetal cell lines early on in development to prove that the vaccine can be taken up by a human cell and does what it’s supposed to do. No fetal cells are used in the vaccines themselves. You spouting shit like this makes us all look like fucking idiots.</p>

<p>If you had covid and survived it, that means you’re immune to it. You fought it off through sleep &amp; being fed nutrition. So why did you take the vaccine? Was it to protect yourself from catching it again?</p>

        <p>At this point I recommend trusting frequently recurring anecdotes more than "science." Even with something as old as aspartame, I trust the frequently recurring reports of headaches that go away after they stop consuming it more than the industry funded "scientific study" that said it doesn't cause headaches.</p>

        <p>The more state-run propaganda tells me to “trust the science”, the less I actually trust it.  “Science” and “government” have become synonyms; therefore the overuse of this phrase is actually undermining <em>real</em> science. I do trust science, but I do not trust the government telling me to trust <em>their</em> ~~narrative~~ “science”.</p>

        <p>Skepticism about public institutions is not the same as skepticism of what those institutions are supposed to be doing. Not trusting the CDC is no more distrust of science than distrust of police is distrust of law and order. People care about police corruption because they don't believe that the police are properly representing law and order. Likewise people who distrust the CDC don't think it's doing a good job of representing the science. Popular trust in public institutions is dangerously low and those institutions would do better to think about why that may be, instead of sniffing their own farts.</p>

<p>* Not actually a medical doctor. And, actually, a quack. So sure, go ahead and trust a quack to tell you to ignore the science. But know this: "Trust yourself" is actually a mantra for "trust me, the quack, the con-man, not the mainstream".</p>

        <p>I agree "trust the science" is a non-sensical term at this point (the science says masks are generally ineffective) and basically means trust the narrative the media is pumping out. "dr" brad is a chiropractor which means he has about as much evidence based medical training as turkey.</p>

        <p>Doubt it. I have zero medical training which is much better than fake medical training. I am aware I know very little about medicine which puts me way a head of this guy. Similar to the way you would be better off having a seizure in my presence than a shamans. I'd be calling an ambulance and seeking a medical professional while the shaman would be dancing around trying to free you of the evil spirits he thinks are causing your seizure.</p>

        <p>You dont need to convince that guy. Chiros for the most part are real healers. I have worked with many and I have seen alot of people who had to be helped into the chiros office in so much pain to be helped and walk out pain free in just a few min. Doctors treat pain with pills because they are not talented enough to figure out what is causing the pain nor do they care.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the kind response. But to be honest, there’s a handful of chiros that are quacks. But that goes for many healthcare professions. I work in a primary care office and I get pulled in to rooms via MDs or NPRs daily to get my insight on Injuries. I’m the first response for our university athletes when Injured but again, for people that have their mind made, it’ll never be changed.</p>

        <p>Holistic medicine is not pseudoscience. It’s generally eastern medicine which works well in the west but here in America, because it’s profitable to sell drugs instead, we use a “western” approach. Supposed to be so much more advanced, but it’s not.</p>

        <p>I agree 100%. The term doctor is so lazy a term for what chiropractors do. They are far from a lazy title. They should be called Healers instead of doctors. Doctors have never healed one person in over 70 years. chiropractors have stopped many pains that a medical doctor throws pills at. The majority of medical Doctors are mind controlled and dont have a clue about how the human body works as a unit. Doctors work on symptoms only and never figure out what is causing the issues. Chiropractors and people who do body work are helping people live a much happier and pain free life. that is why Chiropractors offices and other types of body work are full each day. Medical mistakes kill over 300000 per year. How many deaths are caused by Chiropractors and other types of natural healing?</p>

        <p>Just thought this sub should know, “Dr.” Brad Campbell is a chiropractic doctor not a medical doctor. His degree is from an institution teaching Naturopathy, a pseudoscience. He is not a credible source on modern, evidence based, medicine or vaccines. But sure, trust this guy on Twitter over actual medical experts and the CDC.</p>

        <p>I’m not citing Bill Gates as a credible source on vaccines. I’m pointing out this mans lack of credibility because he is literally telling people to not trust the experts. He’s challenging the position of people who specialize in vaccines and immunology but has no expertise or experience in these fields himself.</p>

        <p>Dude of course there are adverse effects to the vaccine, they’re called side effects and they’re expected. I had a high fever for about a day after both vaccine doses. 24 hours of side effects from a vaccine that could help save your life or someone else’s isn’t that big of a deal... I’ve personally had Covid and also lost a family member to the disease.</p>

<p>Try again, the death rate from the flu is significantly lower (~30x). A large reason for that is because we have a flu vaccine that people get annually to protect themselves and others.</p>

        <p>Hum, there is around 65 million people vaccinated in the US, so 240 000 would actually be the number predicted by scientists for the side effects... Maybe if you were listening to what they actually said instead of strawmanning them you would have a more accurate vision of what's happening.</p>

        <p>It's not killing 240 000 people, 240 000 people have some reactions.</p>
<p>Covid as killed more than 580 000 people in the US alone. So there is two times more covid deaths than people claiming to have side effect.</p>
<p>Edit: and there is 32 million case of covid. So 580 000 death for 32 million case.</p>
<p>There is 65 million of people vaccinated, so 240 000 <strong>sick</strong> for 65 million vaccinated. The cure is not as bad as the virus.</p>

        <p>No, I do trust other people, but my skepticism correlates positively with:</p>
<ol>
<li>How big of an ask they are making of me</li>
<li>How many conflicts of interest or ulterior motives I can think of.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then there's some "rules of thumb"</p>
<ol>
<li>If the federal government is pushing for it, especially all of a sudden - it's probably not great</li>
<li>If the MSM is pushing for it, it's almost certainly suspect</li>
<li>If it advances the interests of elites generally then it's suspect, or of "globohomo" specifically then it's bad.</li>

<p>"Wear a mask" - small ask, whatever.</p>

        <p>Either/or fallacy. Trusting humans in general is risky. Science as a process doesn’t have an agenda and you can trust that process, but humans have biases and humans are the ones using science. Doing an experiment yourself will still be subject to your own biases, but at least you can see with your own eyes. Trusting others because of a label or because they claimed to be or do something is riskier.</p>

<p>No food has the capacity of modifying your dna. Pfizer and moderna does exactly that with mRNA technolgy. No major deaths yet? Good, we will see in a few months when most of people have received the vaccine.</p>

<p>It is obvious that I could be terribly wrong, or maybe not. </p>
<p>It only depends if your daily new feed is provided from msn, who, cdc and other mainstream sites. </p>
