    <strong>/r/Coronavirus AWESOME comments PART 2</strong>
    <p><p>Continuation of the first part, the social end of the hysteria is definitely here, even if the corrupt governments want to extend it forever. More from the same thread (Discussion thread of July 29th)</p>
<p>More interesting comments that have surprisingly not been downvoted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I’m sorry folks, but I just can’t do it anymore. I did everything right last year and nearly tanked my mental well being in the process. I’ve been fully vaccinated for seven months, my parents the same. I became a shut in and cancelled all my plans for the benefit of everyone else. Now I’m just tired and want to live my life again, delta be damned. Cases are exploding in my county and there’s just no way to avoid it anymore. I think the sooner everyone accepts that we’re going to catch this, the quicker we’ll be able to move on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting married in October and really starting to get worried about the return of masks\capacity limit on events. My family and I are all vaccinated, I did my part. I stayed home for a year without seeing loved ones. COVID is over for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CDC Director said 1-2 out of 20 have breakthrough cases. So 90-95% of the vaccinated will never get infected. This new guideline is still about protecting the unvaccinated. This is still a pandemic of the unvaccinated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m sorry but I just don’t accept that idea. The mask was a stop gap until we had vaccines and to reduce hospitalization. If hospitalization isn’t too bad in an area masking shouldn’t be recommended or enforced. Otherwise we will just never get rid of mask mandates by that logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I know the word "endgame" is thrown around a lot here, but IMO it's almost criminal that these incoming mask mandates don't come attached with a specific metric threshold a jurisdiction needs to hit (more vaccinations, lower hospitalizations) before they're rescinded. Just a vague "until things get better" isn't enough. I think what's going to happen is people are going to decide for themselves when they've had enough of a mandate. Hell, that's happening already.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This round of mask mandates will be rescinded slowly as less people enforce them or listen to them. There will be no huge CDC announcement stopping them this time. But in the end this is only going to hurt the CDC. They will still have the current guidelines out as counties/cities rescind their mandates slowly but surely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no endgame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uh huh. People tend to go “full drama mode!” when there is no end in sight to the fluctuating mandates that make life abnormal. Events cancelled, masks on vaccinated people, is abnormal. I’m telling you right now: every single person I know is reaching their final mental breaking point over all of this. But two more weeks to stop the spread right?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep em coming!</p></p>
