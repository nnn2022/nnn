        <p>I truly believe that if this comes to the US, there will be rebel areas in the US that come together. I will move there. If I didn't think this was a possibility, I would probably be losing my mind. I've been poor, practically homeless, and lived with the bare minimum before. I can do it again.</p>

        <p>That's where we'll all be. they've been slowly working on it but we, as a society, are too heavily armed at the moment to truly attack their own nation without major loss of life... Hence why they've spent years now pushing harder and harder to bring the gun ownership down/try to halt it altogether.</p>
<p>We're a nation armed specifically to stand up to government tyranny and fortunately it's actually working in our favor without a single shot fired so far. This is also why they're pushing to teach the younger folks how scary, dangerous and awful guns are - they need them to <em>not</em> own them in a few generations time even if they can't manage to make them illegal.</p>
<p>They're playing a losing game though. One way or another those of us refusing to comply ... Still won't comply ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è there's literally no way possible to coerce or force some of us into it because we've been raised with roots of fighting tooth and nail against government control. Again, why they're wanting to erase history/quit valuing individuality/quit teaching to not trust in the government. It's why we are told to put politicians at celebrity status rather than seeing them as people who work <em>for us</em> as public servants.</p>
<p>When you really look back through the past decade or maybe even more it's very obvious the shift they've created to raise people that will allow them to dictate.</p>

        <p>Love everything you've said here, I am one of those people it is impossible to coerce. My will is too strong. I am middle-aged and I don't know if it has anything to do with the time I was raised or how I was raised but everything going on right now goes against every fiber of my being. It is actually creating a weird sickness in me of low-to-moderate level anxiety constantly because the energy out there in the world is directly conflicting with the energy inside me. We are definitely not in sync and my body and mind knows something is seriously wrong.</p>

        <p>Same here! I‚Äôve been homeless (not actually sleeping in the street homeless but couch surfing/sleeping in my car sort of thing), poor and worked shitty minimum wage jobs. I had a really hard life growing up and if I have to do it again, at least I‚Äôm way more prepared. In the meantime, I‚Äôm going to save as much money as possible. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm going to invest in a new car and some guns this summer, but other than that all my extra income is going into savings. I already have good credit but I might open another credit card too, just to have it.</p>
<p>Maybe I‚Äôll see you there üòÅ</p>

        <p>I was just saying the same thing the other day. I agree with you on this and I also feel like the United States is one of the most litigious countries on Earth. We are already starting to see lawsuits over this. I cannot imagine that when it all boils down to this people are not going to start fighting back. I think this vaccine passport thing is a wake-up call for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>Yeah I want to get one so I can apply for work.... because dying for minimum wage ain‚Äôt worth it </p>
<p>I see the point. 1% people can afford private jets, and they have the money to go and do whatever they want. It‚Äôs the 99% who have to follow rules... look at how many celebrities are noted to be at Epstein‚Äôs island of rape and devil worship. The funny building on the island is a small temple to Moloch, a demon associated with child sacrifice. I believe the Greek story of the Minotaur was actually about the cult of Moloch because like Moloch the beast ate humans. It makes sense too because how close Crete is to the East where Moloch comes from. Minoan civilization also had snake worship. Snakes, are reptiles and that possibly mean Annunaki, Reptilian aliens from the Dracon Prime star system, etc.... just a few connections you can make.</p>
