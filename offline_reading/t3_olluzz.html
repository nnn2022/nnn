    <strong>If masks weren't so heavily forced I don't know if I would have been able to wake up</strong>
    <p><p>Yes I know it's ironic that I woke up but toke the vaccine. However, it's rough when you live in state that was so pro masking and pro vaccinations. Makes me wish I lived more in the south with more freedom. Anyway back to my point. I don't know if I would have been able to wake up if I didn't see for myself that the media and businesses were pushing people to wear masks.   </p>
<p>It really made me question everything when it was becoming an every day mention of Covid this and Covid that. Like just put the science out there and have people decide what to do. It's only because I kept hearing "YOU MUST WEAR IT" did I finally have enough of it. I didn't even fully decide to get vaccinated on my own. I ended up getting it from folks I live with that were so scared of it and wanted everyone to get vaccinated. Would use my heart condition to tell me I needed it. Sure I am overweight, but even then when I got sick before I would be able to rest up for not even a couple of days before getting better. Just like a normal person who would get sick would do.   </p>
<p>Trust me if I could go back I would really question hard on the vaccine and really talk to the folks who were so scared if they trusted it. At least now I can say I am aware and awake to all the bull crap going on now. Especially with people that claim how deadly anti-vaxxers are. Or they claim anti-vaxxers are so vulnerable yet my gf didn't get her shot and she's fine. She even works at a gas station and deals with customers without masks on a daily basis! If Covid or the Delta variant is so deadly explain how my gf is unvaccinated and fine Mr. Fraudci?</p></p>

        <p>Possibly my first step on my route to outright scepticism. </p>
<p>“Hang on, I was told mere days ago that they didn’t do anything and it was advisable not to wear one and now all the people I’ve been listening to seem to have not only unilaterally changed their mind, but have started judging others for not doing the same. Perhaps there are other things that don’t add up and require further investigation”. </p>
<p>Ah, u/umally1993 of June 2020, I hardly knew thee.</p>
