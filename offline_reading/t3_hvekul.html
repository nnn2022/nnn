    <strong>Sick of everyone calling this the new normal</strong>
    <p><p>While I do understand the importance of wearing a mask so as not to harm those at risk (despite not having had to use one myself and not being required to in a certain nordic country), I am just so sick of people thinking that things will never go back to the way things were Pre-Covid.</p>
<p>As a healthcare worker myself, I believe that masks should be reserved for those on the frontlines and in direct contact with suspected or infected patients, while the rest of us should just stick to social distancing and regular handwashing and hand sanitation.</p>
<p>It just feels like everyone is jumping on the mask bandwagon (incl. businesses and corporations).</p>
<p>I cringe everytime some fashion company designs masks for “the new normal”.</p>
<p>You want to know my unsolicited opinion on what “the new normal” could be? Covid-19 will weaken and become synonymous to the flu. We get vaccinated for it like the flu, and we go about our daily lives. No masks, no more social distancing. There are a lot more deadly diseases we could catch.</p>
<p>TL;DR: The new normal is actually just the old normal in my opinion.</p></p>

        <p>That being said though, I’m not against wearing a mask if it helps limit transmission, but to say that we are never going back to a time where we used to not have to wear masks is just bonkers.</p>

        <p>Yep! And we're told we should spend the next few YEARS pretending we're sick 24/7. Defo not a recipe for mental illness.</p>
<p>If people really want to protect others, then forego the mask and just stay home until vaccine. Masks are a cop-out for hypocrites.</p>

        <p>Wearing masks all the time is bad for your health unless you throw it away after no longer than 8 hours and don't wear cloth masks.  Wearing masks without gloves is absolutely pointless.  Wearing masks at restaurants is completely stupid.  </p>
<p>Hell with the new normal.  Masks aren't helping anything because no one is wearing them correctly.</p>

        <p>Masks and gloves. I can’t count the number of times I’ve wanted to smack people in the head for wearing gloves yet still go on texting on their smartphones or touching their faces and hair with gloves on. It’s as if gloves have a magic antiviral coating on them. Surprise! They don’t.</p>
<p>And what’s worse is the mask hoarding. My father in law is a doctor of internal medicine, and there was a point where he had to reuse his disposable masks, or had to resort to cloth masks because the hospital he works at couldn’t get enough supply because of those hoarding idiots. While we all agreed it wasn’t ideal, we thought it was better than not having any barrier at all. Good thing supplies started picking up and he could go back to using proper masks the proper way.</p>

<p>Sure, but the country has to not collapse before the vaccine comes out. That's the current issue.</p>

        <p>Hate to rain on your theory but a vaccine has never been possible for any corona virus let alone one that has yet been proven to exist(they’ve tried for twenty years). The real question is what will the vaccine really be for if their isn’t a novel virus floating around.</p>

        <p>Where I used to work (I used to be a nurse for the NHS in England, but now live in Norway), it was a regular thing that was encouraged but optional, though if you call in sick with flu like symptoms (or the actual flu) and HR finds out that you skipped the flu shot that year, that fact can be held against you.</p>
<p>In my home country it wasn’t required by government, but was encouraged by the health department before flu season (if you could afford it or wanted to).</p>

        <p>My figure skating club is even selling masks now. They started requiring them on the ice a few weeks ago. They’ve jumped the shark. </p>
<p>I was feeling pessimistic the other day and reminded myself that people stopped wearing masks when the Spanish Flu was no longer a threat. We don’t see photos from the 30s of the public in masks because the Spanish Flu was in 1918. I feel like it’s a trend that will just disappear one day especially with all the fashion masks. </p>
<p>A lot of people and companies have moved big events to 2021, like weddings and concert tours and festivals. I don’t think we can go another year without even some of these “non essentials” or more people will be out of work and the effects will be devastating.</p>
<p>I’m starting to wonder how Black Friday will look (big shopping day here in the States after Thanksgiving). November weather is so iffy in some places and I wonder if you’ll have to stand in long socially distanced lines to shop. But I’m at least crossing my fingers that stores relax their capacity limits by then even if they’re still requiring masks.</p>

        <p>I heard today that they canceled Black Friday. Anything that has to be planned in advance is getting canceled because they don’t know what the situation will be. You can spend tons of money and effort getting ready, only to have the government shut it all down at the last second.</p>
<p>My rink is still ignoring the mask mandates. My ballet studio is enforcing it, but they’re one of the few places that does. Most are turning a blind eye to any non maskers. The majority in the ice rink aren’t masked to this day and that used to be what the rest of the city looked like. Now, most are masked and you stand out if you aren’t. But so far no one has acted any differently towards me. I think that’s a combination of fear from some and others who know it’s a hoax but are playing along for now because they don’t want to stand out.</p>
