    <strong>Everything wrong with the vaccination process and why people are right to refuse the vaccines</strong>
    <p><p>Before all, again, I am vaccinated. So obviously I am not an anti vaxxer. Still, there is so much that is wrong from the health authorities handling this that it has caused a valid and legitimate distrust.</p>
<p>First, still requiring masks (in any given circumstance- indoor or outdoor, public places or private places, etc.). If vaccines work, masks are completely unnecessary. Requiring them in any circumstance for a vaccinated person is saying that they don’t trust the vaccine.</p>
<p>Second, variant fear mongering. Studies have shown efficacy at different levels for ALL known variants. When flu existed, the 45%-55% effective shot allowed people to live life normally. But apparently the 95% effective covid vaccine doesn’t. For some variants it is reduced but still not to low enough levels to conclude they are useless against such variants.</p>
<p>And third, if I am vaccinated and I want to visit another country, why do I have to take the PCR test back? The vaccines should work fine no matter where I go. Again, asking for a PCR test to a vaccinated person shows distrust in the vaccine.</p>
<p>Naturally anti vaxxers have good reasons to distrust the vaccine.</p></p>

<p>&rt;They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests.</p>
<p>&rt;Thats right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table and think about how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that!</p>

        <p>Heres the thing with masks; if they would have just from the start been like, "Ya know here in the hospital; at the pharmacy; the old-folks home, you may want to wear a mask, its not fool proof and wont help 100% but not everyone covers their mouth when the sneeze and cough and you are likely to encounter these types of things in high frequency here; please wear a mask." </p>
<p>Then even I wouldn't have a problem with wearing on in those settings but they've pushed things to the point where I will shove a mask up your ass if you try to make me wear one.</p>

        <p>To the first point, it is impossible to decipher who is and isn’t vaccinated without some sort of “vaccine passport” or identifier. People don’t want this, so the solution is just to make everyone mask to avoid the mess. Because of course, once vaccinated people can unmask, everyone else just unmasks too since who is going to check and they already didn’t want to wear them. If anything making people continue to mask is avoiding something even more harmful to people’s  rights (the passport). So yes it would be a a nice incentive to allow people to unmask, but it would also be impossible to monitor since people aren’t good at self governing on issues like that. </p>
<p>As far as the flu goes, I tend to see that issue different than a lot of people. The flu has been around so long that flu deaths are able to be included in the average deaths count of the US. It sucks that that is the case, but it’s the reality. So we already have that illness killing people. So why would we not want to hit covid hard in its first few years to prevent another “flu” from becoming a regular killer that adds to the average heart death toll. If we accepted all viruses that had low numbers, it would add up really quickly and eventually we would have flu season, covid season, virus #3 season, virus #4 season.... and so on, because those viruses had low death tolls individually. But together they add up to a lot of deaths. </p>
<p>As far as traveling goes, that’s dumb, I agree. But there have been a bunch of dumb rules during this whole thing. I don’t think those dumb rules take away from the vaccines importance though. They are just from politicians trying not to be in hot water because they didn’t do something and a massive outbreak occurred on their watch. They are like parents wrapping their kid in bubble wrap. Yeah it’s safe, but it’s not practical.</p>
