        <p>Where is your point? The article says that masks might protect uninfected from infected and might be used in a pandemic Situation.
It's more of a pro mask argument here.</p>

        <p>Yes, they’re saying if you’re presenting symptoms, it can stop you spreading it while going about your normal life.</p>
<p>Literally the other end of the spectrum to ‘wear masks at all times in all settings regardless of whether you’re infected or not - oh, and also don’t leave the house’.</p>

        <p>Kinds with this commentor here. There is fuel for both sides of the argument in this piece. They mention possibly changing their tune if it were to become a pandemic. </p>
<p>Although I feel that the pandemic piece of the current virus is mainly manufactured, doomers will flock to that line.</p>

        <p>There is nothing here about healthy or supposedly asymptomatic people wearing masks.  They say for symptomatic people, the best thing is for them to stay at home, but that if they need to leave the house, wearing a face mask might help.  This is something I can somewhat agree with, as it is a very far cry from 'mandatory face masks for everyone in all public places'.</p>

        <p>Generally I'm totally on your side I'm not criticising your opinion, just the used article.
While yes , they talk about people having symptoms, they also assume that the department of health might come up with other guidelines for the use of masks once it gets to pandemic status.
That's what they wrote and that's what happened, Corona got declared a pandemic and the mask mandates changed.
..in a stupid way yes, but that's not the point in the article.</p>

        <p>Swine flu was also declared a pandemic though and that's what this article is about?  I mean, it doesn't matter really, it's a Wikipedia article, we all know there isn't any science showing their effectiveness, I'm just not sure there's a huge caveat or anything here to make it pro mask. The majority of meta analysis also usually say things like 'masks are unlikely to cause any harmful effects' and things like that, but that doesn't change that they are pretty much useless for preventing spread.</p>

        <p>Sure I know. But back then there was no real reason to milk this pandemic politiclly and economically. Swine flu was more of a test run.</p>
