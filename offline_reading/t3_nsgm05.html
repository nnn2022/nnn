    <strong>New Normal in Germany, Part 8/x: Fun not allowed, mask mandate in place outdoors, at night, during weekends, in the city of Göttingen. Alternatively the square where people gather and socialize will be blocked completely.</strong>
    <p><p>The City of Göttingen has an incidence of 17,6 now. Last weekend, while there was good weather, many young people were found outside. Shocking news! They sat near together! They did not wear masks, outdoors! Shocking! What can we do? Well, easy, said the officials of the City. But read for yourself:</p>
<p>"As a first consequence, the mask requirement will be expanded in certain places in the city. The joint controls by the police and the city security service will continue," said a city spokesman for the NDR in Lower Saxony.</p>
<p>Mask on from Friday to Monday</p>
<p>The mask requirement applies to Wilhelmsplatz and Albaniplatz as well as adjacent side streets. The general decree required for this came into force on Friday. A mouth and nose covering must be worn in the area mentioned on the nights from Friday to Saturday, Saturday to Sunday and Sunday to Monday from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. If the new concept does not work, the city reserves the right to block the square completely.</p>

<p>THIS is the new normal we are rightfully afraid of. </p>
