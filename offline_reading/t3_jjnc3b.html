    <strong>Have you noticed that trolls exclusively come out to sling mud on mask posts?</strong>
    <p><p>For the most part, doomers will ignore posts about government overreach, increased unemployment, povery and other negative effects of lockdowns. </p>
<p>But if you say anything about masks they'll immediately start screeching about how stupid you are. Masks are the only thing that doomers have left. There's not really a big downside to wearing them, so it's the only thing they want to argue about. </p>
<p>In a lot of cases, doomers will turn a conversation about lockdowns into a conversation about masks. They don't want to face the reality that stay home stay safe bullshit harms working class people. They don't want to think about people needing food banks because they haven't been able to open their business for 8 months. They don't want to talk about the implications of allowing your local government to just make mandates unchecked whenever theres any kind of threat.</p>
<p>They only want to talk about masks because they can share their link about how they don't cause CO2 poisoning and then feel well-researched. They'll ignore the fact that cases climb rapidly even after mask mandates go into effect and respond with their circular reasoning: "I know masks work, so if there's evidence that they don't work, it must be propaganda, because I know masks work"</p>
<p>Just like us, they don't want to be stuck in this situation. But admitting that lockdowns have only increased human suffering would feel like admitting they were wrong, so they'd rather blame and bicker with the 1% of people who don't wear masks everywhere.</p></p>

<p>Oh I think a lot do.</p>
<p>They're losers with no lives, who for years have been celebrating how the internet, multiplayer games and streaming have benefitted their existences.  The only problem was they had to endure all their normie friends going out, having fun, living life, meeting people, etc.</p>
<p>Covid (or rather the mandates and restrictions that have accompanied it) has been the best thing to ever happen to them.  Rather than feel like the basement dwellers they are, they now get to carry on exactly as they have been, and their way of life becoming mandated for all. </p>
<p>On top of this, they get to virtue-signal how much they 'care' about grandma^(TM)  while whoring for karma and likes on here, FB and Twitter.  They'll probably post a pic of their dog wearing a mask, just to get front page through r/ aww, despite the dog probably howling in pain for the hour it took to get a photo before it ripped the damned thing off.</p>
<p>And with their lifestyle now validated by society, they'll continue to tell you how 'selfish' you are for wanting to live your life instead of accepting these restrictions - "iTz oNlY a PiEcE oF cLoTh, pUsSy".</p>
<p><strong>When</strong> this all ends, and it <em>will</em>, just remember the cretins who have perpetuated this.  Remember them, and see to it that others do too.  There will be drumheads when the smoke settles.</p>

<p>They're already planning their "lockdown denial" narratives and if confronted they will do everything to deny the lockdowns happened or any socio-economic injury caused.</p>

        <p>Excuse me sweaty, we never even had a TRUE lockdown. Just because everything was closed and you weren't allowed to go too far away from your home and you couldn't get your cancer screening and now you're terminal doesn't make it a lockdown.

        <p>So fucking true. Here's an example from a few hours ago:</p>
<p>https://np.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/jjlg99/diamond_justin_turner_went_into_isolation_after/gaegcpi/</p>
<p>&rt;Nobody was quarantining for a few months in the US. You're not quarantining when you can pop out to the store for a snack.</p>
<p>Apparently being able to get <em>food</em> means there wasn't a true lockdown</p>

        <p>Anything short of literally being welded into your home and having government food boxes delivered through your window isn't a true lockdown. Maybe throw in some "shoot on sight" laws for anyone who manages to escape.</p>

        <p>I posted this elsewhere, but it bears repeating:</p>
<p>&rt;"No True Lockdown"</p>
<p>We can <strong>never</strong> have a true lockdown. It's freakin' impossible.</p>
<p>We would need to have people prepare by buying at least 4 weeks' worth of food (to put you 2 weeks beyond the incubation period of the virus). Remember what happened when people thought we'd run out of toilet paper? How much worse would it be if we were talking about food?!?</p>
<p>We would need to shut down <strong>all</strong> business. No going out for a couple of batteries... no mail delivery... no ambulance in case of injury... no police in case someone breaks quarantine...</p>
<p>Someone will inevitably break quarantine.</p>
<p>Nothing could be built, repaired, etc. Your power or internet goes out, it <strong>stays</strong> out.</p>
<p>No food could be harvested. No milk could be... er... milked.</p>
<p>Etc. Etc. Etc.</p>
<p>Everything... and I mean <strong><em>EVERYTHING</em></strong>!!!.... would have to be shut down, and everyone would need to stay perfectly isolated.</p>
<p>It's an impossible standard, and therefore, no lockdown can be a "true" lockdown.</p>
<p>And yet... I've actually seen people argue for all of that.</p>

<p>Exactly what I thought once it became obvious even to the dullest not-completely-brainwashed soul that lockdowns did fuck all to stop the spread of the 'rona.</p>
<p>Only question now is how many tens of millions of us plebs will have to die this time before we get a "real lockdown."</p>

        <p>I'm still waiting till I'm a lot older to do this same thing with Brexit and No-Deal. Unpopular opinion? Maybe, but I'm sure the losers/remainers will deny their toxic and poisonous rebellion against our democratic vote.</p>

        <p>Nah, the leavers will just claim everything good that happened since 1 Jan 2022 is due to Britannia rule the waves Brexit including any positive social movement and anything remotely bad is due to the EU "fucking us"</p>
<p>Then the remainers will sit there scratching their head at this retorical nonsense and eventually have to join in because that's what countries do. If a leaver neighbours say that Thier new electric scooter shop really took off because of Brexit,  a remainer will have to go along with it, Brexit has divided us too much for remainers to pissed at people's happiness no matter how deluded. If you want to call that hypothetical fine, but I think it's healthy.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the laugh man "scratching their heads at this rhetorical nonsense and eventually have to join in". Yeah I think you're still about a year behind, people have moved on now. </p>
<p>I don't think you grasped what leavers really were thinking. We all knew that we would damage the economy through Brexit in the short term, we all knew that we'd pay the price with more expensive commodities. The difference is, we did this with hope of a bigger, brighter economy and country in the future. Can you say the same about remainers? Don't think so.</p>

        <p>I don't think its healthy to consider this as two separate camps with homogenous outlooks. The reality is that there are millions of people with unique outlooks that you <em>can</em> classify into two groups based on lockdown adherence but in practice all the people in each group are very different from one another. Consider how this sub draws a relatively diverse number of people from those that believe COVID-19 is a hoax to people that believe it is true but that the lockdown achieves little. </p>
<p>This idea that you can state how these people are thinking is dangerous territory because its <em>millions</em> of people and putting words in the mouths of millions of people isn't a process that is ever accurate. Its propaganda or hate-planking at its worst so we should be concerned about where these attitudes might take us. There's nothing wrong with hating <em>someone</em> but to hate a whole group of undefined people is a worrying transition.</p>
<p>I assume in reality what we're talking about is a very vocal subset of these classifications which in practice is <em>way</em> less people.<br>
Its fine to be pissed at the Karens of lockdown obedience but to also include the people behind them that might be <em>as</em> irked by the Karen in question is harmful to everyone.</p>

        <p>I agree. I am surrounded by people who support the lock-down, but none of them are video-game obsessed, basement dwellers. Some of the most sanctimonious supporters that I know are also the people who were and in many instances continue to be very active and social offline.</p>

        <p>I remember meeting this guy at a Black lives matter protest who saw me protesting without a mask on and carrying a sign that included "contact tracing" on a list of police power grabs we should all fight. He got to talking to me, also without a mask on, we continued the conversation at a local pub, and we exchanged social media. Basically, he'd gotten a crush on me and wanted us to hang out a lot more. All well and good...except his Facebook had a bunch of posts of the "#stayhome, anti maskers are stupid trumpers haha" variety. I couldn't square his actual behavior in person with what he posted on social media...which was the real him? It kind of freaked me out. I tried to probe him a bit on the contradiction, saying things like "the reason why you became attracted to me is because you saw my face" and talking about how it was hard for me to trust people because of how people acted one way in person and another online, but I don't think he ever quite got the hint.</p>

        <p>Hello I'm a professional psychologist and it's refreshing to see a few people on reddit that understands how this actually works. Thank you, a bit of sanity has been restored this morning.</p>
<p>They have a contradictory metaphysic: they've been inherently fooled into believing humans are a disease and killing the Earth. Most do not understand how that unconscious belief infects your ethical, moral, and political beliefs and behavior towards others.</p>

You know why? Because I'm being mature about it.  I'm going to bet I'm younger than you, since you have 1983 in ur username (LMAO). That's a nice way to get doxxed. Call me all the names and shit u want, downvote this for all I care. It IS a big difference.</p>

        <p>You know what’s crazy, if you just wore the mask and dealt with the health mandates for like another 4 to 5 months, you could get back to your normal life. The mandates would die off once people start to get vaccinated. You say yourself, “when this ends” , you know it will end so why not do everything to make it go faster. Then the cretins living in their basements aren’t validated anymore. It’s so easy to just wear a mask when you are in public. If you really wanted life to go back to normal you would just wear the mask and push through a few more months until the vaccines come out.</p>

        <p>Just as Luke Skywalker said, “everything you just said was wrong”</p>
<p>This is utter bullshit. I love all the things you mentioned like social media and videogames, but I still go out, hang with friends, and I did this before and now during lockdown. For the first month I enjoyed lockdown, but I fucking hate this shit now, even if I get to play videogames all the time. The fun really fizzles out, but I’m still taking my precautions to keep my self and the people I care about safe. When you social distance and wear a mask (I know you guys hate masks don’t ya) you are protecting people if you want to or not. It’s exactly like getting vaccinated, you protect yourself, and protect the people who have weak immune systems by not getting the virus. The COVID cases are still going up, and we are in lockdown! If we went out of lockdown and suddenly abandoned social distancing then numbers would be in the roof! You people need to think before you speak</p>

        <p>are you under the impression that the bulk of the population was going to NEVER get it or that the precautions were simply to slow it down so systems could cope ? </p>
<p>it really seems like the narrative now is you're never supposed to get it. which is absurd. never getting it was never a thing. until it became political.</p>

<p>do you remember that before covid every single study on cloth masks said they were essentially useless ?</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/</p>
<p>In Nov of 2019 the WHO said this "Reusable cloth face masks are not recommended."</p>

<p>The masks that most people are wearing like the home made t-shirt  and neck gaiter styles are effectively useless. </p>

<p>I live in NZ and found it to be useful. We can go out and about right now and not have to worry about it much. Because if that, my perception is that lockdowns are fine as long as there is compliance.</p>

<p>There’s no evidence of this. Let me know if you find any, though.</p>

        <p>Masks protect no one because they actually increase transmission. It’s been proven that people touch their faces much more often when wearing a mask. We got rid of hankies a long time ago in favor of disposable tissues because it’s more sanitary, but in 2020 we’ve decided to actually strap used hankies right onto our faces 😂😂😂</p>

        <p>Lockdown was never ever used as a way to handle a pandemic because it doesn’t work and causes more problems. We did it because of China. We keep doing it because clearly doing the same thing over and over again unsuccessfully means it will work one day!</p>
<p>This thing is endemic and we must live with it but we will never be permitted again to truly live our lives. It is about power and never was about a virus which is essentially judging by the IFR, like the flu.</p>

        <p>I'm the opposite. When this all started I was very concerned. It was a new virus that we knew absolutely nothing about other than seeing videos of people all over china collapsing in the streets, buildings full of dead bodies, and spraying the city with disinfectant cannons. After its been around a little while we've learned that the virus isn't very deadly at all, it's easily treatable, and the Chinese videos were pure propaganda bullshit.</p>

        <p>Except that masks spread infection and disease, cause bacterial pneumonia, make you touch your face more, the masks harbor bacteria and also aerosol the bacteria and viruses when you talk, cough or sneeze. Masks also lead to increased fungal infections on the face. </p>

        <p>I ask them, so wear does the virus GO once it’s sneezed into the mask? The mask isn’t a black hole that destroys the virus, so where does it go? </p>
<p>“The mask stops droplets and spray from your mouth.”</p>
<p>Sure, that’s it’s function, and it does do that, but the saliva spray eventually evaporates, but where does the virus go?</p>
<p>“It clings to the mask.” </p>
<p>Oh so there’s a special fabric in your homemade mask made out of bedsheets that binds virus? </p>
<p>“No it just stops it.”</p>
<p>What’s the micron width of the fabric? Coronavirus is about 100 microns, don’t you think it would still get through, if not with the initial sneeze, then with you breathing through the virus coated fabric all day? Like imagine sneezing virus into a tissue then hanging that tissue on your face and breathing through it all day. Or putting the tissue in front of a fan. Masks are virus collection vehicles that we breathe through and that dispense virus around all day long. It’s far more hygienic to sneeze into something that is then immediately disposed of or that at the least is not hanging in our face the rest of the day.</p>

        <p>Right, and any suggestion that sneezing into a tissue and then disposing of the contaminated tissue actually slows spread better than wearing the tissue on your face is met again with “just wear a mask you pussy.” </p>
<p>Hell even sneezing into your sleeve you at least don’t have tons of airflow going through the sleeve. </p>
<p>There are some instances I think masks would be better than nothing, like you go visit grandma or someone at risk. You shouldn’t be around them anyway but you should never ever bring in the contaminated mask you’ve been wearing all about town and dug from your pocket. You should put on a fresh surgical mask and then remove it and dispose of it outside the building upon leaving. </p>
<p>It’s amusing to me that barely anyone screaming about masks actually seems to know anything about proper PPE protocol or that their mask is actually a source of contamination.</p>

        <p>I refuse to sneeze into my mask at work. So I'm supposed to walk around with a piece of cloth soaked in spit and snot all day? Oh, I'm supposed to change it after sneezing hard? Wow almost sounds like I have a tissue strapped to my face for no reason. As a grown human being, I am capable of knowing when I'm about to sneeze, and can grab a tissue to do so and then throw it away. Ffs.</p>
<p>Everyone takes their masks off with their hands, not by the straps, as soon as they enter the break room. They leave the mask on the table while they eat, then strap it back on and start working again. No hand washing. No sanitizer in sight. Such health</p>

        <p>My work makes us wear a mask any time we aren't seated at our desks.  So people are touching their face and mask twenty times a day taking it on and off.  Then leaving it sit on the table while eating or shoving it in their pocket.  </p>

        <p>Mask rules are in place for exactly one reason: to appease both maskers and anti-maskers and please absolutely neither.</p>
<p>If you're pro-mask, you really <em>have</em> to know that based on the rules for mask-wearing they do virtually nothing.  You can't be so dense as to think that you can micromanage behavior to the point of perfect mask protocol.</p>

        <p>The issue of filthy masks and no one knowing proper PPE protocol bothers me to no end. Most of these whiny mask Karens wear the same mask everywhere, talk, cough, and sneeze into it, store it in their car glove box, their purse, or their pocket, and no doubt are walking around with a bloody Petri dish on their faces. This isn’t safe for them OR for grandma. </p>
<p>These are also the same people who’ll make weak arguments about masks, like, “well, if surgeons can wear them all day so can we”.... First off, surgeons DONT wear them ALL DAY...they wear them during a procedure and switch them out several times if the procedure is long enough. They also don’t reuse PPE, and dispose of it properly once they’re done with it. There’s practically no comparison here. When Karen says, “so, would you be ok with your surgeon refusing to wear a mask?”, the only reply I can think of is, “if he wore it the way you do, I’d take my chances”.</p>

        <p>They also recycle the viruses into your system. So the viruses that you release with a sneeze, get inhaled deeper into your body.</p>
<p>CO2 poisoning is also common, and you need special training to prevent it. I wonder what fake study they are promoting this time, to make it seem harmless.<br>
There are well tested OSHO standards on masks, and these safety standards go far against the narrative that is promoted by the shills.</p>

        <p>How many people do you know whom regularly and I mean regularly (every 4 hours) safely contain Thier masks and replace them with a new one.</p>
<p>This is my two cents, this is a ludicrous idea that a goal can be achieved through mandated compliance by the government. People are generally too uninformed, untrained and incompliant to do it right. Thinking otherwise is just fantasy.
Not to mention that the compliance doesn't ultimately resolve the problem either, but that is a diffrent story.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, cuz those speed limits, traffic lights, seat belts those are all completely worthless, how could anything government mandated possibly have any chance of being successful. </p>
<p>And, I don’t know many people that wear a mask for 4+ hours, most people get a break and can let their masks air out before returning to their at most 4 hour shift. As I said if you’re concerned with those things yourself, replace it at those breaks, if someone isn’t concerned with them, they’ll continue as normal and be perfectly fine</p>

        <p>It's the easiest scapegoat.  It creates the illusion of safety and it's a very minor inconvenience for most people.</p>
<p>Most of our objections to masks are pretty abstract.  They really don't cause me any harm.  I'm not getting sicker because I'm wearing a dirty mask.  I don't find it hard to breathe.  The most inconvenient thing about them is when I forget my mask at home when I'm going grocery shopping.  Truly, in these terms it's <em>not</em> a big deal to wear one.</p>
<p>My issues with masks go far beyond the mask itself.  It's the government telling me that I <em>have</em> to do something without solid evidence.  It's that a large number of people around me are blindly following the rules without evidence.  It's that people are making incredibly stupid analogies like <a href="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/11/66/67/19361245/3/1200x0.jpg">this</a> to justify wearing masks.  It's the fact that, even though I wear my mask when and where I am legally required, I'm looked down upon for questioning their efficacy.  It's that even <em>experts</em> in the field who suggest that the science on masks is certainly not settled are having their credibility called into question for expressing doubt.  It's that everyone seems to have forgotten that the WHO and the CDC and Fauci all recommended <em>against</em> masks in the earlier part of the pandemic, and now are acting like "it's just common sense!" when they tell you why you should wear a mask.  It's the fact that whenever I attempt to bring up my well thought out reasons for not wearing a mask (which granted does not necessarily make my reasons <em>correct</em>, I'm just pointing out that I <em>have</em> given the subject a lot of thought and done some research) most people's response is little more than "just fucking wear it".</p>
<p>It's the fact that I can't smile at strangers anymore.  People are hiding half their face from one another and it makes us all feel less human.</p>
<p>The mask makes this world a less beautiful place to live in.  This is not a loss you can quantify in any way, but it doesn't make it any less significant.</p>

        <p>You nailed it on the head though. Masks are a political scapegoat. Nothing more. </p>
<p>No one really knows if they are working- since no one will publish any randomized trials. </p>
<p>What masks ARE doing though, is allowing everyone to blame subsequent deaths on people not following the rules (even though we know that the vast majority of people contracting the disease are using masks in public). It’s a clever trick, really.</p>

        <p>Masks provide the perfect "out" for politicians and leaders.  They have to appear as if they are "doing something" and masks are a simple thing they can push and get people to rally behind.</p>
<p>If cases go down, they can say their mask mandates worked and that government knows best.  If they don't go down, it can easily be blamed on the boogeyman "anti-maskers" who are to blame for everything wrong.</p>

        <p>Yes. It is also an easy way to use them to blame for cases rising (when we know cases are mostly PCR bullshit). You don't wear your masks! It's your fault the virus is around! It would go magically poof if you wore masks! (Everyone wears masks.) Don't blame me, I'm your governor here to protect you!</p>

        <p>Not to mention people I see <em>are</em> following the rules.  I haven't seen a person inside a store without a mask since probably July.  In public on busy streets I'd say it's about 50/50, and probably 60/40 or 70/30 in favor of no mask when walking through my local park.</p>
<p>I'd say it's pretty darn unlikely that someone will be passing COVID to another person just by walking past them in the outdoors, so it seems to me people are following the rules just fine; the rules just aren't accomplishing anything.</p>

<p>I don't see how people don't equate mask mandates to rules of a lockdown. If your option is "sit inside your house" or "go for a jog, while wearing a mask" that's not a fucking choice. And you can replace "jog" with almost any other normal activity.</p>

<p>So it seems you are still more on the "it's a conspiracy" side of things, but care to offer an argument as to why instead of mindless downvoting?</p>

        <p>I don't believe most people have actually done the research by looking at medical journals. They simply parrot what others tell them. The quantity of opinion does not mean quality analysis. In other words, I'm not swayed in a discussion ruled by popularity.</p>
<p>The name of that logical fallacy is: argumentum ad populum.</p>

        <p>True. Example autism like I've.</p>
<p>I would've got a medical exempt if society was different than what it's now, but it's not. The only reasons I've not done that are because of aggressive behavior from society. People around me getting super anxious, treats me unfairly and think I'm selfish or a potential threat. It's lot of emotional arguments everywhere. Masks aren't there to protect you against the virus. They're there to protect you from pro lockdown people's anger issues and placebo for COVID-hypochondrias.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, these are the majority of every day people you see on your commute, in stores and at work.</p>
<p>Their intentions are good. They see masks as the final solution to covid. In their mind, if everyone would wear one, there wouldn't be covid in a month.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you bring up the fact they are receiving their information from peers and the msm, they deny any other credible information exists. It is cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>One theory is they can't possibly imagine government corruption to this extend, never mind worldwide, so believing in the mask makes them feel like things are normal.</p>

<p>I find myself especially interested in a set of quotes from the CDC and one of the above sources.</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0714-americans-to-wear-masks.html</p>
<p>“We are not defenseless against COVID-19,” said CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield. “Cloth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus – particularly when used universally within a community setting. All Americans have a responsibility to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.”</p>
<p>If you search for the word "cloth" on that page, it will come up 13 times. The CDC insists upon cloth masks in particular. However...</p>

<p>"We have provided the first clinical efficacy data of cloth masks, which suggest HCWs should not use cloth masks as protection against respiratory infection. Cloth masks resulted in significantly higher rates of infection than medical masks, and also performed worse than the control arm. The controls were HCWs who observed standard practice, which involved mask use in the majority, albeit with lower compliance than in the intervention arms. The control HCWs also used medical masks more often than cloth masks. When we analysed all mask-wearers including controls, the higher risk of cloth masks was seen for laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infection."</p>
<p>Furthermore, where does "Flatten the curve end"? The curve is going up because of testing, but deaths are largely flat in many countries. So we flattened the curve (well we didn't, it is just the natural cycle of a virus), now we are "slowing the spread" - when does it end is my question. WHEN DOES IT END?</p>
<p>"When a vaccine comes out"</p>
<p>Do you really think the whole masking and lockdowns will stop when a vaccine comes out? We wouldn't even know this virus existed if China didn't release those initial staged videos. </p>
<p>Nope. Masking and lockdowns will continue and they will tell us: mandatory vaccines. Even if it is rushed and potentially dangerous. And it won't end there. We will need 4 a year.</p>
<p>And then we will need another type of vaccine.</p>
<p>The point of this is to sell trillions in mandatory vaccines and for it to NEVER END. If you can't see that now, maybe it will be more apparent with time.</p>
<p>The mask reminds you there is a problem. That is why it is so important, not because it helps.</p>

        <p>Then why do reddit doomers always say "this pandemic would be over if everyone just wore a mask?"</p>
<p>Like come on, even Fauci isn't saying that. The general consensus seems to be that the pandemic won't end until enough people have immunity, either through a vaccine or actually contracting COVID.</p>

        <p>My theories:</p>
<p>Any 'inequity' not explicitly sanctioned by the lefty/pomo-neo-marx worldview is sacrilegious. (eg. income, privilege, gender, etc.)</p>
<p>Masking everyone is a powerfully 'equalizing' symbol of allegiance. Wearing them is like performing a religious sacrament. Like Islam, everyone is brought into submission, and the very act of submission to this 'law' can purify you.</p>
<p>It also says humans can control their fate, and we are building the invisible tower of babel to prove it!</p>
<p>In these regards, the mask is even more powerful than critical race theory / BLM because every skin color can hide behind the mask. 
 Every single person can contribute.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this also makes no-mask the new red hat.  The no-mask revels in their privilege, <em>clearly</em> doesn't care about others, and is very firmly, <em>not my tribe</em>.  One misplaced 'brick' can ultimately bring the tower to heaven down!</p>

        <p>It's not really equalizing, though, right? Because, in my experience, the people who are the most virtue signaling about masks are not wearing the regular ugly blue masks they give you for free at certain places when you show up without one, or the regular boring black masks street vendors sell for cheap outside the supermarket, or something they already owned like a scarf or bandana. Nope. They're wearing cute fucking fashion statement masks with political slogans or cool colorful prints on them, bought for way more money off some other virtue signaler's Etsy.

        <p>99% of the brigaders are probably under 18, children who stay home in their basement all the time anyway, but now they get praised for doing it. They're now the most virtuous members of society, and they get to revel in the misery of others.  They even get to cover their faces, which they always wanted to do due to low self-esteem and chronic acne.</p>
<p>The "New Normal" is a wet dream for them, and anyone trying to end it must be stopped. Kind of like how snow days used to be the best thing ever when you were a kid, and you got angry at the snowplow driver for trying to clear all the snow away. Now as an adult, you hate snow days because it means shoveling out all of the snow from your driveway.</p>

        <p>I have a hard time breathing in masks after about 20-30 minutes. I usually have to pull it down for awhile after that. I had Asthma growing up, not serious, but had an inhaler for it. I have used it more in the past 7 months than my entire adult life. I keep one around just in case, but only really used it on airplanes in the past. Now I am using it a few times a week.</p>

        <p>Same, they aggravate my asthma as well. After wearing them for more than 30-ish minutes I get headaches and sometimes start to hyperventilate. </p>
<p>I’ve also had acne flare-ups which I haven’t had to deal with in years. And with my OCD — I have a lot of anxiety specifically in regards to not being able to breathe properly. Case in point: As a teenager, I couldn’t mow the lawn because I was so afraid of accidentally inhaling too much gasoline that I would keep stopping the lawn mower and walking away to go breathe fresh air. (Of course, I recognized logically that this was silly, but you often can’t stop a disorder from doing its thing.) </p>
<p>Plus, masks perpetuate an atmosphere of fear. My primary beef is with lockdowns and forced closures, but masks cause more people to panic, which leads to continuing restrictions. If we could just open up <em>fully</em> with no threat of re-locking down <em>ever again</em>, maybe the masks would not seem so bad.</p>

        <p>One of my recent posts is being brigaded pretty heavily, pretty much entirely about masks even though my post wasn't specifically about masks. I browsed some of their comment history and realized they're all teenagers (or younger?) And spend all day on the meme boards and pewdiepiesubmissions.</p>
<p>I don't mean to hate on people that age, but i think I'm general they haven't developed any sort of advanced critical thinking skills. At that age it's more about just fitting in and doing what's popular.</p>

        <p>&rt;For the most part, doomers will ignore posts about government overreach, increased unemployment, povery and other negative effects of lockdowns. </p>
<p>These are the same people that nag and beg you to vote in state and local elections because they're soooooo important. But as soon as you hold them accountable for screwing up, they will engage in political tribalism to prevent, shame, and blame you for speaking up.</p>

<p>Cases are rising despite mask usage? Well, they aren't wearing them correctly. That must be it.</p>

        <p>I think the mask mandates are backfiring but the doomers just don't know it yet. I actually think that masks worn properly could help a bit under limited circumstances. But now the narrative is that masks are some guaranteed virus stopper, literally nothing is more important than wearing the mask at all times. So many of them completely forgo the "social distancing" part. They stand 3 feet apart with masks talking in each other's faces, yet get angry if someone rides by maskless on a bike. I've seen a lot of posts lately lurking on some of the other subs where people say they are worried that they were in contact with someone who had the virus. And others will say "well if you wore your mask you will be fine!" Or the people that said the BLM protests were not virus spreaders because "everyone wore masks." There is a reason that contact tracers ask about who you might have had close contact with REGARDLESS of mask use.</p>

        <p>It’s partly because of all the government overreach, the mask thing really is the least harmful. Kids not being in school, businesses being forced to close, and people not being allowed to congregate in public is a way bigger deal. Masks are certainly not good for society, but society would certainly carry on if masks were the only thing we had to worry about. </p>
<p>Can you really blame them though when they have been told that masks work better than a vaccine?</p>
<p>They literally think they are saving lives every time they come on here and yell at us. Every time they wear a mask alone outside. That’s what the propaganda says. “Masks save lives.”</p>

        <p>We will absolutely find out in a year or two that masks contributed to the spread because no one wore them correctly, touched them all day long, and were reused many many times.</p>
<p>Actually, we probably wont find out. That info will be deleted to save face for the politicians who did this.</p>

        <p>I was just in an argument (not on Reddit) about the negative effects of cancelling cancer screenings and other procedures, for the patients and the staff, and how hospitals are not doing well, and it’s because of our knee jerk reactions, not covid. </p>
<p>The only response was “wear a mask you stupid bitch.” </p>
<p>When I responded that I DO wear a mask, up to 10 hours a day on the medical campus I work at, I was told “well I FOLLOW SCIENCE, something you clearly don’t understand.” I literally work in academic epigenetic research. When I told them that and asked where THEIR degree is, I was told again to wear a mask.</p>
<p>They have an arsenal of phrases they pull from even if they are nonsensical and irrelevant to what is actually being discussed: wear a mask you pussy, I follow the science, Trump bad. They don’t actually have their own responses to anything because they don’t understand what they’re even discussing.</p>

        <p>Sorry ur comment was removed by automod, was it someone random online or someone you knew in real life? This sounds like such a bot response. After you told them you wear a mask everyday they totally disregard and give you some random covid catch phrase insult that doesn't even make sense as a response.</p>
<p>I'm convince 90% of the users that post on R/coronavirus are bots and the rest useful idiots that feel good talking and getting up voted by bots without realizing it.</p>

        <p>Yes I have.</p>
<p>It's an arguing tactic.  Focus on one thing, highlight that, ignore everything else and act as if that one thing is the only issue.  Not only that they continually over state the effectiveness of masks and even the fact that some doctors have realized they aren't effective and have stopped wearing them in surgery.</p>
<p>What I find really disturbing about this whole covid crap is that there's seems to be this concerted effort to silence actual doctors who are not only treating patients but doing so with great success.</p>
<p>It seems like this time has caused people to become completely intolerant of any narrative that isn't from the "approved authorities".  But THAT ISN'T THE WAY SCIENCE WORKS!!</p>

        <p>Yeah i find it very weird too that people come and criticize OUR posts about masks when we have actual reasons and they only use “its scientifically proven” and provide a link to a paper. Why are they trying so hard to get us to wear them. It must be a hoax, because why would safety or this ‘herd immunity’ thing actually matter or help in any kind of way.</p>

<p>They have been working on this for many decades, progressively taking away our identities, our community, our family, our belief systems, and our purpose basically deconstructing us and now they are remolding us to suit their purpose. They have become our new God and we do not question nor oppose the Gospel of the new religion there have endowed upon us.. This is why the isolation and division was essential to achieve their goals in conjunction with feeding  and exploiting our strongest weakness, hate. When people group, they tend to reach more logical conclusions, but when they are divided and isolated they can only turn to the source they have access to, which is the source they are using to spread their new religion..
Honestly, it's a work of art...Years and years of psychological studies and experiments performed on us, they know precisely how we will react under any circumstance. </p>
<p>The question is can we and how do we reverse the effects of this psychosis that people have spiraled into?</p>

        <p>We could and it would be hard for many people to accept, rationalize, and understand. It'd require politicians, journals, scientists, and the media to publicly admit overreaction and societal ideals got in the way of truthful thinking. It sucks because imagine the news not fear mongering and admitted our overreaction was uncalled for.</p>

        <p>These are the exact behavioral patterns exhibited by people who suffer psychosis and / or delusions. Their beliefs become their reality and no amount of evidence, reason or logic can change their minds. Even if the people who sold them the lies, fully admitted it's fiction, these people would continue to cling to their beliefs becasue the contrast would shatter their new reality and the mind could not cope.  Just proves how effective their brainwashing program has been!</p>

        <p>My problem with masks is when people act like it's no big deal to wear them for 20 minutes while shopping (which is whatever, i wear my mask when shopping too), completely ignoring the people like me who work at those stores that have to wear them for hours on end. Seriously, its something I never see brought up in these conversations and it sucks to feel so forgotten about. So much for essential workers 🙄</p>

        <p>I love when they post a study about masks not causing CO2 build-up, because every single study I've seen posted thus far has used a pulse oximeter to show that oxygen saturation doesn't decrease. Which would be fine except that pulse oximeters can't detect hypercapnia (excess CO2) and can actually mistakenly represent it as O2 because they only use red light to approximate blood oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>None of that is even getting into the disgusting microbiome that masks become and how none of the general public is properly trained on how to use them, rendering any miniscule potential benefits null.</p>

        <p>People don’t want to talk about the issues with lockdowns since they know the issues with them already, and they understand that we could help fix them by cutting taxes, mortgages, loan payments, bailing out floundering businesses at the end of lockdowns, but people don’t want to since it’ll result in a tax increase at the end of covid (whoopdeedoo, big deal to save people from the virus and the economic impacts). Lockdowns have increased suffering simply due to governments not wanting to do those things since they’ll be yelled at and replaced by the people that don’t want taxes raised (which also typically tends to be the same group that’s so anti-lockdown due to its economical harm. Big surprise there)</p>

        <p>I mean in this case, mask mandates are put into place to reduce covid cases. That didn't happen. So why would the assumption be "well they do work, we just can't see any evidence of that".</p>

        <p>Masks are one of dozens of factors put in place to try and reduce case numbers. And then there are countless other factors unrelated to safety measures that could increase the number of cases in a given region. If an outbreak coincides with a mask policy that does not mean the masks caused it or did nothing.</p>
<p>The only way this graph would be proof that masks don't work is if every other factor was eliminated, 100% of people followed mask orders (which they don't), and all other safety protocols were followed completely.</p>
<p>Why do you think academic studies have control groups?</p>
<p>Also if masks didn't work why do you think they've been used in countless outbreaks in the past and health/healthcare organizations around the world spend billions of dollars a year on them? Do businesses love to loose money for no reason?</p>

        <p>&rt;Masks are the only thing that doomers have left. There's not really a  big downside to wearing them, so it's the only thing they want to argue  about.</p>
<p>If that is all, I can let them have it. I'll wear a mask if my government tells me to do so (but I live in Sweden and they never will). I think we're past the point when masks can compromise the reaching of a herd immunity within a few months.</p>
<p>I will however not comply with stay at home orders and curfews unless I have covid-19 symptoms.</p>

        <p>I don't think anyone's contesting that lockdowns suck. Most people don't like having reduced social options. Most people aren't crazy about wearing the masks all day. Most people just want to party again.</p>
<p>The difference is that many people are willing to get through the lockdown in order to keep this virus at bay.</p>
<p>You may disagree that the virus is as much of a problem as the rest of the world does. But that's the answer to your question. They aren't going to argue with you about lockdowns because they agree that lockdowns suck and they want them to be over. They also aren't crazy about the amount of government control needed to make this happen. They also aren't crazy about the economic effects this is having or seeing people lose their businesses or struggle with mental health problems from isolation.</p>
<p>So really, you're not disagreeing that this situation sucks. You just disagree on whether it's worse to open now and bear the brunt of this virus in favor of a "normal" life, or whether this temporary hardship is worth having a SAFE normal life once the vaccine is deployed later on.</p>
<p>Nobody is going to argue with you about something you agree on. Literally everyone agrees that this sucks and we all want it to be over as soon as possible. It's just that most people don't agree with you that we should consider it over now.</p>

        <p>Part of the deal was we would lock down for <em>two or three weeks</em> to allow time for hospitals to expand how many patients they could take, and buy a little extra time for research. Extending it to the Diet Lockdown of heavy business restrictions for 8 months, and moving the goalposts so many times from "flatten the curve" to "eradication" or "no having a life until there's a vaccine!" feels like a bait and switch. We don't trust the authorities anymore because they either were intentionally lying from the start or changed their mind and went back on their word multiple times with little to no honest scientific data to back it up. The data points to the disease being <em>less</em> lethal than we first thought (by a large margin), heavily age-stratified, and not preventable by any measures that are reasonable for the general public. You can add meaningful restrictions in limited places - hospitals, with extra precautions in certain wards, nursing homes, and such. The costs when imposed on the healthier public are much too high and offer less benefit.</p>
<p>So no, I am not willing to go through another lockdown. I followed the rules in March and part of April. I didn't go anywhere except work, the grocery store, and the gas station. I let them take away almost everything that made life meaningful for a month - I did my part, and while I'm realizing now that was a terrible idea, I didn't know it then. If they didn't expand capacity properly when they had the chance and didn't even keep up a list of who they can rehire quickly in the winter if needed, that's on hospital administrators and health agencies, not people who don't work there and don't really have a say in how medical facilities are run.</p>
<p>Basically I don't trust that they'll give us our lives back even if we do what we're told. They can't entice people with a carrot and stick when they have a history of denying us the carrot and hitting us with a stick even when we follow the rules. And it's not their job to guarantee us a <em>safe</em> normal life - that's something each person needs to handle for themselves. The amount we need to be comfortable isn't the same, so we need to be left to make our own personal determination.</p>

        <p>Yes, this exactly. I’ve said this a few times, but this is what I wrote on my white board in April:</p>
<p>“Coronavirus Game Plan -</p>
<p>Step 1: Lockdowns and social distancing</p>
<p>Step 2: ???</p>
<p>Step 3: Vaccine! (12-18 months)”</p>
<p>For those of you familiar with South Park, it’s literally the Underpants Gnomes theory of public health. I’ve been sitting around waiting for Step 2 for 8 months. Fucking figure it out. No pity for you SLC and El Paso for your hospitals being close to capacity. You knew this was coming, you just didn’t care to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Back in March/April, I was pretty mad at the federal government for wasting 2-3 months of prep time, but that is no longer relevant. I’m mad now that the state governors put us into these lockdowns without any plan to get us out.</p>
<p>I remember saying to a friend of mine back at the end of April, “Ummmm... what happened to flattening the curve? It’s for sure getting flatter here in NY, what’s next?” It is completely a bait and switch, and that’s the part that makes my head explode.</p>

        <p>Again, you can trust or distrust at your discretion. But it's not going to affect how this vaccine progresses, nor will it in any way affect the virus. The virus doesn't care whether you're sick of it, or whether you put in the effort. It does not give participation trophies.</p>
<p>And like with drunk driving, saying that YOU can decide whether you want to take the risk isn't really the discussion the rest of us are having. Sure, drunk driving poses a risk to you, but maybe you're right, and you really can handle it, and you really can drive better drunk, and your car is made of steel and can take a crash, and you are willing to take the risk so as to avoid the tyranny of taxi cabs.</p>
<p>But the problem with drunk driving isn't the risk you pose to yourself when you take on that risk. It's the risk you pose to everyone in your path. Which is why drunk driving is illegal. It has nothing to do with government control. It just requires government control because some people couldn't care less about the lives they threaten while drunk driving. We have to work with the lowest common denominator of social empathy.</p>
<p>Here's another way to put it. Can you think of a way to prevent people from driving drunk that doesn't infringe on their desire to have the government out of their lives?</p>

        <p>Drunk driving isn't a basic human need. Socializing is. The equivalent would really be saying that nobody is allowed to drive at all unless they carpool with someone they already live with.</p>

        <p>But you aren't being asked to stop socializing. You're being asked to temporarily socialize differently in a reduced capacity than before, and only because there is a deadly virus out there spreading through social events.</p>
<p>You aren't being asked to stop driving. You're being asked to not drive drunk. You're still allowed to drive, but your freedom to drive in exactly the way you want to drive is restricted, because complete freedom in being allowed to drive however you want at whatever speed you want inebriated by whatever substances you want is going to get people killed.</p>
<p>This is a new restriction, and it's temporary, and it's because of a life-or-death situation. If the mandate was to put everyone in individual locked cells forever, that would be a deprivation of socialization.</p>
<p>I have worked with a kid who spent the first ten years of his life locked in a room and receiving absolutely no socialization outside of his intellectually-disabled mother. I know what lack of socialization actually looks like.</p>
<p>Look, I understand that some people are going to react badly to the restrictions in place, but while I know you guys aren't crazy about consideration of comorbid conditions when determining what "counts" in life-or-death situations, someone who kills themselves as a result of having to wear a mask or not go to parties is almost certainly suffering from a comorbid psychological condition that was exacerbated by the lockdown, not as a result of the lockdown itself.</p>
<p>If I'm not allowed to consider a problematic heart failing due to COVID as a COVID death, why should I be expected to consider a suicide due to depression exacerbated by lockdown restrictions a "lockdown" death? It's all tragic, but it does seem like a double standard by this community.</p>

        <p>Can't quite articulate this, but my "feeling" is that talking about stopping the virus vs ignoring the virus is like getting stuck on the surface level of the situation... lots of things have happened or have  been revealed by the Virus. The effectiveness of measures is pretty questionable (what is not questionable is that media and "science" are 100% sure the measures aren't questionable at all) and the "side-effects" might be worse than what is being prevented. What I'm seeing is a "better safe than sorry"... well life is made up of many issues, if you give all of your attention to just one then others start slipping out of control. To get that last 1% of safety you'd need to destroy 90% of economy. Yes I think economy breaking is worse than a person directly dying... countless more will suffer (and die too) over time in the former case.</p>

        <p>I mean, from my perspective, stopping the virus and ignoring the virus are completely antithetical positions. People who are ignoring the virus are preventing the virus from being "stopped", or controlled. So that's not a conversation that can be avoided between the two sides. Unfortunately for everyone involved, the potential consequences for the personal choice to ignore the virus are not limited to the individual making that choice.</p>

        <p>Well, this is obviously about how you frame it. It's pretty obvious that stopping virus = good and ignoring virus thereby killing people = bad. But there's a lot more behind those two labels... trying to stop the virus with lockdowns might be like trying to heal smallpox with a bloodletting. Yes I realize that saving lives always good, but in your righteous fervor you might be killing others without realizing. Example: you argue for lockdowns, kid is locked at home and can't go to party and kills themselves. Aren't you responsible for the kid's death? Ethical question: is it better to kill an old person or a young person when you can't save both? Why?</p>

        <p>The thing is, I don't think we're framing it differently at all. We both recognize that the lockdowns aren't an ideal way, or even a sustainable way, to live. We all understand how this is affecting people.</p>
<p>Hell, I work in a public school with violent and aggressive kids, and we're in a partial lockdown situation where my students are only in the building for half the usual time. I FULLY understand how lockdowns are affecting the mental health of these students. I FULLY understand how this lockdown is affecting many of these students who are poor. I FULLY understand how these lockdowns are affecting my students' educations. I understand this all extremely well, probably better than most people here.</p>
<p>We are on the same page here.</p>
<p>Just remember that this community has a double-standard when it comes to attributing death to COVID. On the one hand, this community claims that COVID death numbers are inflated because people with health complications who die during or after COVID are counted as COVID deaths. On the other hand, people in this community count deaths related to lockdown, even if they never contracted COVID, as "weighty" deaths meaningful in evaluating our COVID response. They count more to this sub than comorbidity problems.</p>
<p>Governments will generally approach problems like this from a utilitarian philosophy, especially since right now, we have resources to help people manage the problems associated with lockdowns and isolations. My job is literally providing some of these resources. We have almost no resources to help people who are permanently affected by or die from COVID, so the response is going to focus on the things we can actually help.</p>
<p>Once we have a vaccine, COVID will be something we can address directly, and the ethical calculus you're proposing will become immensely simpler.</p>

        <p>Well, it's the extreme utilitarianism of the government that is pretty much triggering antimaskers... what we get is literal lies in the news, with the apparent justification that it is for a good cause (scare people into staying isolated, which maybe might help against virus... very pragmatic, but pretty demeaning to separate people... doesn't feel nice to be saved from yourself). My workplace has actually banned working, so now it's a sin... while the highest virtue is buying and consuming things. The virus will blow over sooner or later in any case but the cattle herding will remain.</p>
<p>We should ask what exactly this utilitarianism is motivated by... is it extreme dedication to saving lives? It's probably something closer to keeping face and being reelected. Or maybe it's taking away other's wealth and power for yourself. Pretty tempting isn't it?</p>

<p>Yes because when someone kills themselves and says "I did this because of the lockdowns" it is definitive what killed them. When someone dies of a heart attack in the ER and tests positive for COVID after the fact, they are added to the death statistics for COVID and probably used to push the "long term side effects" narrative even though they likely wouldve died from a heart attack anyway due to poor diet and lifestyle, or simply age. If you dont see the obvious difference, I dont know what to tell you.</p>

        <p>The key difference, however, is whether they would have died THAT DAY from these issues if they had never gotten COVID. If not, then COVID was responsible for them dying that day, even if death would have eventually come for them down the line anyway.</p>
<p>Let's say you're suffering from an infected wound. I then give you an immunosuppressive drug for some reason. Your immune system tanks, and the infection kills you. It's still the immunosuppressive drug that is actually responsible, because if that hadn't been introduced, you may not have died from the infection, and even if you were on your way to death, it wouldn't have happened THAT DAY without my immunosuppressive intervention. The infection killed you, but I am still liable, absolutely.</p>
<p>Doctors aren't just assigning causes of death to these people for fun. They're taking into consideration whether this person would have died without COVID or not. Plenty of people live with heart conditions (like a mild arrhythmia) for long and normal lives, but with COVID, those heart conditions can become life-threatening.</p>
<p>People don't always die or are even affected by an arrhythmia, so you're suggesting that if they DO die from an arrhythmia after COVID affected their heart, it shouldn't count as a COVID death, despite the fact that they almost certainly wouldn't have died THAT DAY from the condition if they hadn't contracted the virus?</p>

        <p>I don't think most pro-lockdown people care to understand anything about the negative effects of lockdowns. The rhetoric of "sAvE liVeS" pre-supposes that the only lives that matter are those lost to covid19; deaths of hunger, suicide, drug overdose etc. due to lockdowns don't count. I think it's because blaming the poor for their poverty and the unhappy for their unhappiness is a huge part of our culture. So if this sub counts non-covid lockdown-caused deaths as more "weighty", it's because we're screaming in the face of a covid-obsessed media that want to pretend those deaths don't exist, or don't matter, or were inevitable anyway. Even right here in this thread you have an example of the mindset, with Zeebidy saying "If a kid kills himself over a party then that's more of a problem for a therapist"...because who needs friends when you can get teletherapy and drugs, right?</p>
<p>I remember wanting to kill myself every day for about 2 months this spring due to extreme social isolation, and seeing nothing in the popular media about the mental health effects of lockdowns besides stuff like "how to cope when the loved ones you're stuck at home with are getting on your last nerve" and "it's ok if you're not using your quarantine time to do Instagram-worthy baking projects". I also remember thinkpieces from technocrat types ("Great Reset" et al) saying that there was no going back to the "old normal" of doing things in person, and see even more of those today. They say things like "we should wear masks and social distance forever because it'll saves lives from flu/the next pandemic",  or "we should make restrictions on travel and business permanent because of climate change". Yeah.</p>
<p>TLDR: no, we are not all "on the same page". There are a lot of people who don't count lockdown-caused deaths in their calculations, and a powerful few who want the cost of lockdowns to <em>never</em> be addressed because they want this "new normal" hell to go on forever.</p>

        <p>Well, as I've said elsewhere, I work in the mental health field with violent and aggressive students who suffer from a myriad of problems, including suicide attempts, anxiety, psychotic problems, abuse, and so forth. I am in a better position than many to understand exactly the sorts of things that you're talking about, and yet, I'm still making the arguments that I'm making.</p>
<p>Because again, I have ways to try to mitigate the damage of isolation. I'm reaching out to my students virtually, taking care of their mental health as best as I am able, providing the education and support that they need, etc.</p>
<p>There is literally nothing I (or most people) can do if they get COVID.</p>
<p>So if I have to choose between helping my students face a problem that we have the resources to help with (isolation) and the problems that I have absolutely no resources to help with (COVID), then I'm not sure I even really have an ethical choice to make here. Neither option is great, but society has a way to help one group of people RIGHT NOW, even if there are people slipping through the cracks.</p>
<p>If you know somebody who is struggling with the effects of isolation, I would highly recommend that you have them reach out to one of the many therapists and psychology workers who are operating virtually right now. There are a lot of resources to help manage this side of things in relative short term. I'm doing my part, and most of the rest of my field is as well.</p>
<p>And I'm curious who you think is benefiting from this "new normal" going on forever.</p>

<p>I 100% believe that being with people is probably the best cure for social isolation. I also recognize that we aren't always able to choose the absolute best solution for every problem, especially in times of crisis. Therapy is not going to be a "substitute" for human interaction, but it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to help you get through a tough time in your life, and that's what we're all experiencing right now. A tough time in our lives. Some people are going to react to it more strongly than others, and some will react to it REALLY badly, but that doesn't change the fact that sometimes the BEST solution isn't always the one that's possible. This is what I'm having to teach my students, even prior to COVID.</p>

<p>Yeah, I mean, I'm not a huge fan of big data, but I feel like that when I'm in a sub that is bellowing how COVID is just an alarmist conspiracy theory, and then get told I should worry about YOUR alarmist conspiracy theory instead, my thought is that you're more comfortable worrying about a POSSIBLE problem than the one we are very obviously facing right now. </p>
<p>I have no doubts that they're capitalizing on this as much as they can (as Amazon has with their delivery and such), but I honestly am skeptical that they have the power to perpetuate an international epidemic by manipulating the entire world's medical research community into spreading false information. The second a vaccine is ready, it'll be distributed, and I don't think Facebook is going to be able to stop that from happening. Big Data was doing just fine prior to COVID, and I'm sure they'll be up to those same shenanigans after COVID.</p>
<p>I feel like people WAY overestimate how easy it is to manipulate the medical research community or how badly each and every scientist on the planet wants to be the one that proves every other scientist incompetent. Big data is powerful, but not enough to overcome the ambition of the person who could end a worldwide plague scare by proving the medical community wrong.</p>

        <p>From what I've seen in the field of psychiatry, it's not that hard to manipulate medical "science" given a strong profit motive, and even easier to manipulate the popular media that spins said "science" into something the average person can understand. As far as what I've seen around covid19, it's the latter that has driven government lockdown decisions. Not the raw numbers, but the spin.</p>
<p>What I've seen from the "we will have to continue this stuff forever" crowd is the assumption that the vaccine won't be 100% effective, as flu shots are not 100% effective against the flu now. What then?</p>
<p>Aside from worries about the future: there is ample evidence already to show that lockdowns are causing serious harm to people right now. You want to treat those harms as inevitable and the deaths from covid19 as worth preventing whatever the cost, leaving debate about lockdown costs to some point in the indefinite future when we get a vaccine that totally fixes the covid19 problem. At bottom, this isn't an argument against present vs future costs, but an argument against which deaths and health problems should be seen as something worth prioritizing the fight against, and which should be seen as unfortunately necessary casualties of how we organize our society. Because covid19 has been prioritized, deaths from poverty and loneliness have been dismissed as necessary casualties.</p>

        <p>I disagree that deaths from poverty and loneliness (the latter of which I would honestly have to classify as "death by psychological disorder exacerbated by loneliness") are being disregarded.</p>
<p>If we were disregarding these people, then I literally wouldn't have a job right now. Disregarding this people would be refusing to continue providing education to students who are isolating at home. It would mean that therapists stop holding sessions completely instead of learning how to do it virtually. It means that the COVID vaccine would be a for-profit endeavor, which will almost certainly not be the case.</p>
<p>I am working as one of the people who is reaching out and trying to ensure life continues for people who are isolated. If I didn't give a shit, I'd go work doing something more lucrative at a stay-at-home job rather than sitting in a building that's already had three confirmed COVID cases this year around children who are taking no deliberate effort to protect me from the virus. We absolutely are not dismissing problems as "necessary casualties." We're trying to mitigate the situation as best as we can.</p>
<p>I apologize if you either aren't exposed to these services or don't think they're good enough. But there are resources out there for dealing with the isolation. There are still no resources for COVID. Until that changes, I'm just doing the best I can to help people who are suffering.</p>
<p>And of the many students I work with, most of them with significant anti-authority attitudes and violent aggression at being told what to do, I have had exactly zero problems with mask compliance from any of them, including the one that told me to fuck off yesterday trying to help him finish his math. He did it through a mask.</p>
<p>I've spent a lot of time talking about this today, and appreciate the mostly civil responses, but I might be about tapped out for the moment. Take care.</p>

        <p>It's a matter of priorities. Of course you are doing what you can to mitigate the lockdowns' effects on your students, I am not saying you are indifferent to them; just that you don't want their wellbeing to be what primarily determines public policy, you want reducing covid19 spread to take first priority when it comes to determining public policy.</p>
<p>Because after all, they were already "psychologically disordered"; they are an underclass. It's true that covid19 patients typically have something else already wrong with them physically beforehand (diabetes, immune system diseases, or just the normal frailties of old age), but those underlying problems are not used to make them into a social scapegoat class the way "psychological disorder" is.</p>
<p>Again, not that you don't care about your students; you just don't think their possible deaths are as important to determining government lockdown mandates as possible covid19 deaths.</p>
<p>As for bringing up masks, that is just proving OP's point.</p>

        <p>I mean there's a key difference in bloodletting and a lockdown. Bloodletting never helped in the history of disease while lockdowns have been a proven strategy to slow down the spread. Lockdowns have far less ill effects. If a kid kills himself over a party then that's more of a problem for a therapist</p>

        <p>Oh... so there was no historical precedent and the measures were pretty random, but it turned out that they are great and help a lot?</p>
<p>Honestly my impression is that there are very active attempts at convicing us that lockdown means less death and we should be welcoming them, but this veers into conspiracy theory territory.</p>

        <p>I wonder if you see the irony in your statement. If we are talking about people dealing with the exact same thing as we are, and they beat it through quarantine like many other countries, then it seems pretty relevant. Also if we look at germ theory of disease we know that pathogens are, most of the time, spread through physical contact. So, we prevent that contact and the people who had the disease overcome the disease, we have less deaths. While it won’t completely wipe out the virus it will slow its spread until a vaccine can get out to the public. We could cut back on quarantine if people wore proper masks as we know the virus is spread through particles in your breath</p>

        <p>Yeah, I know there's reasoning behind it... such as mask stop air current. But that's not enough to say that it will work... reality is complicated. In fact it's pretty surprising just how well it seems to be working, according to the reporting. If even they're truthful, there's 0 reason to "woulda", such as "woulda been better if everyone just masked up". Oh I mean sure there's a reason, because it mighta, but it's pretty exaggerated just how confident people are when saying this.</p>
<p>If you live in the US I wouldn't trust any piece of news because it's probably trying to convince you to vote one way or the other... reporting truth being secondary and optional. Unless you want to be convinced of course.</p>

        <p>I don't know what my words sound like to you nor do I care about reaching you, and I admitted probably being delusional in the post just above. That's the difference between us, you're just so sure you are a hero for calling people pathetic and stupid. Well, enjoy the fad while it lasts.</p>

        <p>&rt; Most people don't like having reduced social options[...] Most people just want to party again.</p>
<p>You really think that's all this is about?</p>
<p>People are watching the businesses they built with their life's work and savings, go under because of lockdowns</p>
<p>People are losing their jobs (and by extension, their health insurance) left and right</p>
<p>People are losing their homes because they can't pay their rent or mortgage</p>
<p>People are watching their entire <em>industries</em> collapse on themselves because they're not allowed to open.  (see: anyone who works on Broadway)</p>
<p>Children are receiving inadequate schooling because they're forced to do everything on Zoom.  They are also being deprived of social development and physical play, at a time in their lives when those things are absolutely crucial to their long-term mental health.</p>
<p>Parents who are lucky enough to still be employed are struggling to do their jobs because they have their hands full supervising said Zoom schooling during their own working hours</p>
<p>Adults and children alike are succumbing to addiction, if not suicide, as the hopelessness of their situation becomes overwhelming.</p>
<p>If it were just a matter of "hey, maybe don't have parties for a little while", more people would be willing to comply.  It would not be <em>as</em> big a deal.</p>
<p>Even if it were a matter of "wear a mask, and then you can get on with your life and do everything you would have done otherwise, just with a mask on", I think people would have more patience for them.  Even people on this subreddit (which is not an inherently anti-mask subreddit, btw)</p>
<p>Totalitarian shutdowns of entire massive industries is cruel, counterproductive, and leads to mental and financial devastation for tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>"Aww man, this really sucks".  You speak from a place of privilege.  It doesn't "suck", it's destroying lives.  People need to be allowed to go back to work, <em>now</em>.  Lockdowns don't save lives, they cost lives.</p>
