    <strong>Didn't even knew these vile ones existed...</strong>
    <p><p>After reading some pro-covid-vaxxer's posts, I checked-out where he mostly hangs out at, and found the following subs that I never knew existed:</p>
<ul>
<li>r/Moronavirus, 36,427 members are <em>social distancing</em> </li>
<li>r/vaxxhappened, 325,365 members are <em>sane people</em></li>
<li>r/antivax, 30,354 members are <em>reading</em></li>
</ul>
<p>After perusing all three subs, all they do is mock and belittle others who have major concerns about "the new normal". </p>
<p>More cesspools of evil to avoid.</p></p>

<p>&rt;My sister and her boyfriend don't really follow Qanon or any of that crap, yet somehow believe Qanon crap. The latest that they believe from Qanon people without actually following Qanon, is that even though I'm fully vaccinated, I will still carry the virus, and spread it. What?</p>
<p>Haha. Should we tell him?</p>

        <p>I've seen a lot of people talking about wanting to put us in what is essentially concentration camps. I wish I was joking. This was more on twitter than here but still highly unsettling. Very disturbing to look at that view of the human psyche.</p>

        <p>They are unable to see that genocide is about in-groups and out-groups, and this time around they are the in-group that is dehumanizing others and calling for their removal to ensure the "purity" of society.</p>
<p>They will decry any and all warning about this, as they cannot associate genocide with anything except Jews, Nazis, cattle cars, and gas chambers. </p>
<p>They cannot understand that genocide has 8 to 10 stages and starts out small with measures such as dehumanization and segregation, both of which are currently happening.</p>
<p>They cannot understand that genocide can happen anywhere, and that it does not necessarily require ethnic/religious/racial animosity. It is solely about the power dynamics between in-groups and out-groups.</p>
<p>Our education system has failed us. These individuals would not recognize a genocide unless there were an exact replica of the Holocaust involving the Germans mass murdering Jews once again.</p>
<p>I've said it before, but I feel it's best to say it again. </p>
<p>The people that demonize the pro-autonomy out-group the most are often the same ones that love to virtue signal and claim that they would have risked their lives to hide Anne Frank in the Holocaust. </p>
<p>In reality, they would have been the first to call up the SS when they heard that someone was harboring the "unclean."</p>
<p>How do we know this? They actively are participating in multiple stages of genocide and see nothing wrong with it. </p>
<p>http://genocidewatch.net/genocide-2/8-stages-of-genocide/</p>
<p>By encouraging dehumanization and segregation, they are creating a two-tiered society where the "impure" and "unclean" out-group has fewer rights and often is denied their humanity. They see nothing wrong with this, however, as "it's different this time, you guys."</p>
<p>They are not joking about what they say, however. If they ever get the chance, they will have no qualms about removing the out-group from society. They will fully support any and all actions to do so, as they will be done under the guise of the "greater good."</p>
