    <strong>Anyone thoughts on taking a Covid Vaccine, if it is a traditional one?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm with you all that we should never take the experimental viral vector or mRNA vaccines that are currently available (at least here in the US).  I'm with you all that Vaccine Passports are a terrible idea, and I will boycott any business that tries to require them, and will never use such a passport.</p>
<p>BUT, I may be willing to take one if it is a traditional vaccine, one that uses tried and true method, of taking a weakened or deactivated form of the virus to trigger protective immunity.  I recently found out some exist, named Sinopharm and Sinovac and are widely used in many countries.  I may consider this but first I'd have to see some legit studies on side effects, injuries, etc caused by it.  And also ensure the companies that make them are trustworthy.  Just thought I'd put it out there, wondering anyone else's thoughts on this.</p>
<p>Update: There is another traditional vax from India called Covaxin.</p></p>

        <p>If and when those things get regular approval for distribution and if by then covid will actually be more deadly than driving a car, I'll consider it. Until then though, there's no discussion</p>

        <p>I'm with others here.  Once it goes through a proper trial and approval process, it might be worth considering, but it's a cold, my family is healthy, and the immune response is superior from actually encountering the disease.</p>
<p>In all likelihood I have been exposed multiple times already, given 2 kids in different daycares and plenty of friends with their own jobs and kids' exposures, so a vaccine is redundant anyway.</p>

        <p>Look I understand people who have low risk of dying from it or having a bad case not wanting the vaccine, but as someone who’s had Covid, and had a relatively mild case, and now is experiencing lasting symptoms—it’s really “not just a cold”. </p>
<p>I am 29 years old, used to run 15-20 miles a week, former college athlete, lift weights 3-4x a week along with other active sports like surfing and hiking. Now I can’t do any of that. I have headaches like never before, I’m constantly winded if I do anything that slightly gets my heart going. </p>
<p>While I’m hesitant myself of the vaccines, labeling it “just a cold” is lying to yourself. Do with that info as you will, but i wouldn’t brush it off so quick. This shit has stolen my life.</p>

        <p>This can happen from any cold, any flu, really any infection at all.  Some of these problems are MORE likely for athletes.  I'm sorry this happened to you, but with hundreds of millions of cases worldwide, complications like this are empirically rare.  We also have lots of deaths from the vaccine and even a guy who is losing the skin on his legs.  Sucks, but anecdotes aren't data no matter how emotional they are.  This really is "just a cold" in the same way that we dismiss flus, which are much higher risk than covid for the young.</p>
<p>Additionally, you were most likely diagnosed with covid through a PCR test.  Do you understand what PCR does, how it works, and how little it means?  It means you were exposed to sars-cov-2 (assuming the protocol is correct, which the Drosten paper leaves in question).  It doesn't mean you had covid.  It doesn't mean you got sick from it, it doesn't mean it caused your "mild case", it doesn't mean it caused "lasting symptoms."  It may have done, but PCR can't tell us that, and we don't typically perform any other tests to confirm even live virus, much less some causative link.  Most serious cold and flu complications in healthy populations are from people who don't bother to rest up and heal before re-exerting themselves and developing secondary infections or inflammations and opportunistic diseases.</p>

        <p>All right, less than a year old account, I'm gonna need more than your personal anecdote as an argument. I'm sure more than a handful of people have died from food poisoning at Taco Bell, but no one would consider the same draconian measures to achieve <strong><em>100% safety.</em></strong> Your story is awful for you, but even if true, it is not persuasive.</p>

        <p>You are correct that two Chinese vaccines are more traditional vaccines in the sense that they inject you with dead/weakened cells of the virus. However, neither vaccine’s manufacturer had been forthcoming/transparent in the vaccine’s results/efficacy. Therefore, it’s difficult to assess how useful they are. Many poor/developing countries are willing to take a chance of the Chinese vaccines because the Pfizer/Moderna vaccines that are apparently more effective are being purchased en masse by rich countries. </p>
<p>Even if the Chinese vaccine was effective, there would be some hesitancy to use it in the US due to growing anti-PRC sentiments in the US</p>

<p>Yeah, it's just not possible to make vaccines for coronaviruses and this worldwide experiment is going to be a catastrophe. Fortunately for them, they have already conditioned the masses to think about dangerous variants and strains, which they'll blame on the unvaxxed.</p>

        <p>I personally don't need a vaccine but people around me took either Sinopharm or Sputnik V, no side effects reported where I am. Of course you'll hear Sinopharm is not as effective but to me it is obvious that Pfizer and Moderna are working hard on bashing all the others so at this point I can't really believe anything coming from the US, UK or Germany 100%.</p>
<p>All in all, if I needed the vax, I'd take Sputnik V, simply because those who made it will neither pressure people to take it, nor make it mandatory. Sounds fair to me.</p>

        <p>I would be okay with a traditional vaccine, but I don't see the necessity. </p>
<p>But it's not that easy to just say that, there has been an unusual lack of informed consent with these rollouts. "You get what we have!" I'm not joking when I say you will need to inspect the label on the vial yourself and keep your eyes on it as they prepare it.</p>

        <p>A lot of the problems stem from the fact that its a coronavirus and that creates different reaction for some reason so the 'traditional' one will still have those issues. I think its a vector vaccine too isnt it? So not really traditional</p>

        <p>I'd probably take a traditional one. I'm against passports too, and I'm not too concerned about the virus itself (may have already had it in 2019), but I don't think a traditional vaccine would hurt me. It's mostly this new-style vaccine I'm suspicious of, no matter how much they claim it's safe.</p>
