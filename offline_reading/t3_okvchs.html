<p>Dr. Charles Hoffe:</p>
<p><strong>“The concern is now that these vessels are permanently damaged in a person’s lungs.</strong> When the heart tries to pump blood through all those damaged vessels, <strong>there’s increased resistance trying to pump the blood through those lungs. So those people are going to develop something called pulmonary artery hypertension, high blood pressure in their lungs, and the concern with that is that those people will probably all develop right-sided heart failure within three years and die.</strong> Because they now have increased vascular resistance through their lungs and lung tissue and heart tissue and brain and spinal tissue, and all of that does not regenerate. In other tissues it can regenerate, liver and kidneys and muscle, but there’s some tissues that cannot, and so <strong>this absolutely explains what I’ve seen in my patients</strong> and that’s what I’m doing to prove it in my studies ongoing.”

        <p>I definitely can easily accept that medical marketing pseudoscience has no products to cause the vascular endothelium to regenerate.</p>
<p>Given that medical marketing agenda ignores science in whatever ways are most profitable to do so, I think it is not proven that vascular endothelium <em>cannot ever</em> regenerate.</p>
<p>While I'm certain that everything else he said is correct, with him being a doctor, it's likely his knowledge is confined to medical marketing pseudoscience, and severely biased against knowledge of ordinary health measures.</p>

        <p>So in 3 years 60% of all vaccinated will be dead.</p>
<p>If we think 60% accumulates, then people who take two shots have only 16% change to survive, and people who take three shots 6 % change. Now then, lets think they get 90% of the population of the earth vaccinated three times. That would mean that from that 90%, 84% would die, which then means that 6% of the vaccinated survives.</p>
<p>Now then, the total population of the earth is 7,674,000,000 from which 10% is 767,400,000. Then 6% from 90% is 414,396,000 which leaves us with a total population of 1.2 billion. Well, if they would only half that they would get pretty close to the number in the Georgia Guidestones.</p>
<p>I can't wait those 3 years to complete.</p>

        <p>No I don't believe he is trying to say that 62% of Vaccine recipients will suffer adverse reactions. I don't even wish that to be so.  62% showed increased d-dimer markers but not necessarily enough to harm all of them. I personally don't wish harm on those taking the vaccines.A lot of them are just mislead.</p>

        <p>I agree with that. So far his studies only show that 62% have this increased d-dimer, which might do some tissue damages but not necessarily enough to lead to death. </p>
<p>This video complements quite good to the latest video from Dr. Bhakdi (see: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oj06m5/dont_take_any_shot_especially_dont_take_the_2nd/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oj06m5/dont_take_any_shot_especially_dont_take_the_2nd/</a> ), who is illustrating what Dr. Hoffe is also mentioning. </p>
<p>I could imagine that the amount of clotting will increase over time as long as the cells will continue to produce the spike protein, not sure if they stop at some point - not an expert in this field.</p>
<p>I fear the worst is yet to come and I hope I am wrong about it. Maybe we will end up with a scenario like u/T12J7M6 is picturing, but I don't wanna imagine how the new world would like in such an event.</p>

        <p>But what if they get 90% of the total population vaccinated 3 times? That was on which I based my hypothetical calculations. Like your own video link too (which I downloaded to my PC, thank you very much for it) proved that even the second shot might be enough to do it, and then there is even the third and who known how many more. Like I think Canada is even planning to give the vaccine every year for ever to everyone. If so then I might not be far from the reality with my math.</p>
<p>I think people forgot that these people running the world don't just day they want to reduce the population of the earth, but they really want it and are working hard to achieve it. Like saying what I say shouldn't be anything new to people in my opinion. They want you fucking death, period.</p>
