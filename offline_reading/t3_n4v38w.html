    <strong>The "cure" might be more like the disease than you'd think</strong>
    <p><p>So, this is kind of nuts. <a href="https://www.n-tv.de/wissen/Forscher-Covid-19-ist-eine-Gefaesserkrankung-article22529342.html">Yesterday, there was an article about some brand new research in the German MSM.</a>.</p>
<p>I'll give a full DeepL translation in the comments, but here is the gist of it:</p>
<p>Covid can be seen more as a vascular disease than a lung disease, because the spike protein in itself is actually already a very dangerous thing that can cause strokes, blood clots and damage to your lungs.</p>
<p>Now, that's what the article says. But what else than Covid causes your body to produce a lot of the spike protein? The vaccines. This research might be the explanation of the blood clots, myocarditis and such that we've observed in vaccines so far. </p>
<p>This also means, that you are literally injecting your body not only with something that is a hint to your immune system, but also definitely actively harming it - basically poisoning yourself to a certain degree - which vaccines aren't supposed to do (of course we know that about these vaccines already, but now there is a reasonable explanation for it...).</p>
<p>This is pretty scary stuff and might confirm some suspicions about the vaccines.</p></p>

        <p>So, it's higher than the death rate of Covid itself? When the death rate of the "cure" is higher than the virus itself, something is clearly wrong.</p>

        <p>DeepL Translation:</p>
<p>It has been known for some time that the spike protein of the coronavirus is something special. Apparently, however, it is already extremely pernicious in its own right. This has been demonstrated by researchers using a "pseudovirus".</p>
<p>Until now, the spike protein of the coronavirus has been associated primarily with the special contagiousness of Sars-Cov-2. A study now shows that the proteins also play a key role in the covid-19 disease triggered by the virus.</p>
<p>In the paper published in the journal Circulation Research, researchers from the U.S. and China show that Sars-CoV-2 damages and attacks the vascular system at the cellular level. In their view, therefore, Covid-19 is a vascular disease. In their opinion, this is the only way to explain the large number of apparently unrelated complications following corona infections.</p>
<p>"A lot of people think it's a respiratory disease, but it's really a vascular disease," Uri Manor, one of the study's authors, is quoted as saying in a news release from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. "That could explain why some people have strokes, and why some people have problems in other parts of the body. The commonality between them is that they all have vascular underpinnings." The researchers followed up on this lead in the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Spike protein alone is enough
For their study, they created a "pseudovirus" surrounded by the classic Sars-CoV-2 crown of spike proteins, but containing no actual virus. The pseudovirus already caused damage to the lungs and arteries in animal models - evidence that the spike protein alone was sufficient to cause disease. Tissue samples also showed inflammation in the endothelial cells that line the walls of the pulmonary artery.</p>
<p>The team repeated this process in the lab, exposing healthy endothelial cells to the spike protein. This showed that the spike protein damaged the cells by binding ACE2. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is produced mainly by cells in the lung, where it can serve as a portal of entry for the virus at the cell surface. However, ACE2 is also produced in soluble form and is distributed in human serum. Its physiological function is to degrade the blood pressure-raising hormone angiotensin I. Damaged binding interfered with the molecular signaling of ACE2 to mitochondria, the organelles that generate energy for cells. This damaged and fragmented the mitochondria. If the damage becomes too great, the cell dies.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed a similar effect when cells were exposed to Sars-CoV-2. However, this is the first study to show that the damage occurs when cells are exposed only to the spike protein. Even without replication capabilities of the virus, "it still has a major damaging effect on vascular cells," Manor said. The reason, he said, is its ability to bind to this ACE2 receptor, the spike protein receptor.</p>
<p>The scientists now hope to gain new insights into the infectivity and severity of mutant coronaviruses with further studies on mutant spike proteins. They also hope next to be able to study in more detail the mechanism by which the destroyed ACE2 protein damages mitochondria and causes them to change shape.</p>
