        <p>They've been sci-fi stories to this effect.  A virus is too unpredictable as to who gets it.  It's tough to contain, but the vaccine is another thing altogether.  You know exactly who gets it, and you can largely contain its effects.</p>
<p>Release a largely harmless virus.  Then, convince people to take the vaccine, the real bioweapon, through propaganda</p>

        <p>Wow, you pretty much summed up every false thing the media has spread about Covid.  Look, we all know it's not nearly as deadly as people like you would have us believe.  Most of the Covid deaths aren't caused by Covid.  They simply had a positive test, and something else killed them.</p>
<p>&rt;Oh, I get it that you will say, “99% are ok!!?!”</p>
<p>Mor like 99.95% of people are okay.  Even the WHO says the ifr for those under 70 is 0.05%.  Amd for people over 70, their comorbidities are the caise of most of those deaths.  If you say otherwise, then you have to admit tue vaccine is killing just as many instead of saying they were going to die anyway.  The vaccine is just incidental.</p>
<p>Let me educate you on some real science.  Not sure it will help because you obviously don't understand virology.</p>
<p>&rt;It is what is called a fast mutator</p>
<p>Amd like other respiratory viruses, each strain makes it more transmissible and less deadly, unless you're vaccinated that is.</p>
<p>&rt;In this case, the virus will continue spreading throughout the world’s population until eventually it will mutate into a form where it is highly infectious, extremely lethal, and won’t stop killing people</p>
<p>Except the variants are less deadly, and natural immunity works against them.  How convenient you forget about the immune system.</p>
<p>You want to read sci-fi.  Read your own post.  It's poorly written, but pure fiction.</p>

        <p>True, I used facts.  You rely on opinion.  You come across someone who isn't flustered by your baseless rhetoric, and you leave in search of easier prey.  Yet more proof Covidians are opportunistic predators only interested in feeding on others despair and anger.</p>

        <p>You first.  Prove that all these people died FROM Covid, they didn't have any other conditions which could have resulted in their desths.  Prove the variants are more deadly instead of only more transmissible.  Again, show how these deaths couldn't have possibly been from another cause.</p>
<p>Also, stop trying to blame every animal on Earth of being a source of infection.  Just because a high cycle PCR test is positive, doesn't mean they can transmit it.  It's just as inaccurate in them as it is in people.  Next you'll claim a watermelon had Covid and infected someone.</p>
<p>But since I'm interested in providing actual evidence.  I'll give you this one for free:</p>
<p>For people &lt; 70 years old, the infection fatality rate of COVId-19 across 40 locations with 
available data ranged from 0.00% to 0.31% (median 0.05%); the corrected values were similar.</p>

<p>Let me guess, you're going to say this is opinion too? Maybe cherry pick an out of context statment to say my source doesn't support my argument?  Perhaps, accuse me of not caring about the elderly or childre ?  Going to say it's heresy?  </p>
<p>I'm done here.  Your original reply was 100% opinion.  I replied with facts.  Go find someone else to convert to your faith. ✌</p>
