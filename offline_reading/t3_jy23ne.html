    <strong>Why the mRNA vaccines terrify me, and why I’m NEVER getting one</strong>
    <p><p>First and foremost, sorry for the extremely long post. If you read until the end, I thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, we’ve all seen the mainstream media outlets being selective about the information they present regarding these mRNA vaccines. The companies spearheading this effort (namely Biontech, Pfeizer and Moderna) continue to boast their over 90% success rates, further giving the public reason to inject a rushed vaccine, using never-before-seen technology, available for human use in just under one year. Indeed, the mRNA technology has been in development for 30 years now with plenty of unsuccessful animal trials, and no human trials until this year!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Powers That Be have effectively been able to take away the livelihoods, liberties and rights of billions of people with no accountability. Millions, if not billions of people have been overcome with desperation, depression, anxiety, hopelessness, poverty, and cynicism. It’s come to the point where many people acquiesce to these tyrannical restrictions, exclaiming to those around them, “Ugh, I can’t wait to just get that <strong>vaccine</strong> to go back to my normal life!” </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sentiment alarms me, because it accepts a false dichotomy of either unending, sporadic lockdowns or a vaccine imposed upon you by authoritarian governments that don’t really care about your health. It disgusts me that people are being forced into accepting one or the other. This alarm led me down a rabbit hole to studying the pathology of protein diseases, and to try figuring out why TPTB want to primarily use an mRNA vaccine so badly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Are Prion Proteins?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proteins that <strong>prions</strong> are made of PrPc, or prion protein, which are normal proteins which occur mainly in the nervous system but are found throughout other tissues in the body. The infectious kind is called PrPsc. When misfolding of proteins occur, it becomes a malignant agent known as a prion, with the ability to transmit their misfolded shape onto normal variants of the same protein. Other proteins can exhibit prion-like behavior, but I’ll touch on that later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What Are Prion Diseases?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the CDC, prions are considered “abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are able to induce <strong>abnormal folding</strong> of specific normal cellular proteins called <strong>prion proteins</strong> that are found most abundantly in the brain.” Even the CDC admits, “the functions of normal prion proteins are still not completely understood.” Mad cow disease is probably the most well-known of the prion diseases, but neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and certain forms of dementia have been revealed to be forms of prion disease as well. What’s terrifying about prion diseases is it’s highly infectious nature within the body. Just a singular prion can collapse nearby proteins into the same misfolded shape. This linear progression of protein collapse leads to disease. Oh, and guess what? Although prion disease is rare, it is <strong>fatal 100% of the time.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What’s important to note is that prion diseases have an <strong>exceptionally long incubation period.</strong> You can have prion disease and go five to up to twenty years without noticing signs of disease. However, once the proteins multiply and aggregate into <strong>amyloids,</strong> collections of these misfolded proteins, they collect in overabundance between nerve tissue, lead to a rapid deterioration in health, and <strong>unavoidable</strong> death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, little is known about PrP, why proteins misfold into prions and why amyloids lead to disease. It’s been discovered that other proteins, such as amyloid beta (implicated in Alzheimer’s disease) can misfold and lead to prion disease. And, surprise surprise, little is known about why this happens as well. Does this mean other proteins, not just protease-resistant proteins, are capable of exhibiting prion-like behavior and causing disease?</p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The role of Phosphatidylethanolamine and mRNA</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This word is way too long, so from now on I’ll be referring to phosphatidylethanolamine as <strong>PDT.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PDT is a lipid found in all living beings. When PDT in food undergoes the Maillard reaction (what happens when food is browned and makes it taste so good, like cookies, breads, steak, etc) it rearranges into a more toxic form called an amadori product. Amadori-PDT’s cause oxidative stress and are higher in foods high in sugar, fat, and cooked to high temperatures. It’s also present in processed foods. You know, all that bad shit you shouldn’t be eating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a personal note—I’m not a believer in completely ridding yourself of these foods. I believe in balance, and as long as one strives to eat foods rich in nutrients and antioxidants to combat foods causing oxidative stress, you can lead a healthy, balanced life. Your body was designed to do just that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, where am I going with this? How does it relate to prion disease? Well, guess what…PDT’s have been discovered to be a significant endogenous co-factor in propagation of infectious prions. This also makes me think about the standard diet in the majority of developed countries, and how these diets are rife with Amadori-PDTs. Why, instead of educating the public about the importance of nutrients and antioxidants, do they aggressively push the need for a vaccine? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only are PDTs a cofactor, but polyanions (single strand <strong>RNA molecules</strong>) are a crucial factor in the production of infectious prions. Without that single strand RNA, prions won’t have that high level of infectivity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How this all relates to the vaccine</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the vaccines appear to be shrouded in mystery, the companies do give us this bit of information: the vaccine uses messenger RNA to essentially “hijack” cells and encode it with the information to produce spike proteins. Cool, right? Except this coding is coming from the outside in, to create a protein from the inside out. A protein your body <strong>doesn’t naturally produce</strong> (I may be wrong on this). It’s bad enough that scientists admit the presence of foreign RNA could lead to an inflammatory response, thereby leading to autoimmune conditions that may permanently disable you. Either way, they’re taking advantage of the public’s ignorance and claiming that this is all just a natural process of your body (making proteins), there’s nothing to worry about, and that the vaccines are over 90% effective. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Side note—what are they considering effectiveness? The presence of antibodies? Because sure, they very well could be present, but what about how the incredibly complex ribosomes of your cells get altered by this RNA? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my questions are this. Why are we artificially introducing mRNA to change the way our cells express proteins? How do we know these proteins <strong>don’t have the potential to be malformed?</strong> We are aware the Standard Western Diet already has major health implications in neurodegenerative diseases, among other diseases (including COVID!!!), why aren’t we advocating for healthy, balanced living? How many of these shots do people need to take throughout their lifetime? Why is the vaccine so rushed when a potential disease to come of this new technology has an incubation period of at least five years? How do we know this vaccine can’t cause that? Why use this technology for COVID-19, a disease with an over 99% survival rate for the majority of the population? Why aren’t we opting for focused protection of the vulnerable? Why is it so hard to get a definitive answer if these vaccines will be mandatory? Why are our livelihoods being, essentially, held hostage?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why now?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The risk to reward ratio doesn’t make sense. All this for a disease with a <strong>99% survival rate?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts/Conspiracy Time</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m drawing too many conclusions in linking this RNA vaccine to potential prion disease. Still, you’re interfering with the natural mechanism of protein production in the body. Why would you want to tamper with such complex and delicate biological machinery? Machinery responsible for producing hundreds of the most complex compounds found in the human body, proteins? Remember, it only takes a small amount of malformed proteins to progress into fatal disease. Imagine giving these vaccines to a child and this happens. A child that’s 5 years old and needs this mRNA vaccine to go to school. What if prions develop and now their life expectancy is 25 years old? Could the world be seeing a mass extinction within the next 5 to 20 years from these vaccines?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m also aware that Gates and his family are known eugenicists, and there are theories floating around that TPTB want to cull the population by over 90%. It makes sense for them to permanently take away any sense of normalcy for the global population and giving them a promise to return to normal by getting one (or many) little harmless shots. It sounds so appealing. It’s <strong>mass psychological warfare,</strong> and they know it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And no, I don’t believe the vaccine will take away your humanity, turn you away from God, or keep you from getting into heaven. I know TPTB have finessed the public into thinking the only people that are against vaccines are religious nuts, selfish idiot “Trumptards”, and woo-woo essential oil people that are “against science” and under the unfortunate influence of vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. Well, guess what. I was enlisted in the U.S. Air Force for four years stationed at a combat control squadron. I got injected with every vaccine known to man (with the exception of smallpox, since, ironically, the military knows it could give me a fatal reaction due to my eczema). I’m <strong>never</strong> getting this mRNA vaccine. It’s not the concept of vaccines that scare me, <strong>it’s the technology.</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would rather wear a mask for the rest of my life than be subject to this vaccine for this reason. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are all capable of living happy, healthy, abundant lives through diets rich in nutrients, exercise, mindfulness and stress management. My body is biologically fine-tuned to thrive on these pillars of healthy living, and I refuse to let TPTB fool me into thinking my body is incapable of protecting itself, especially against a virus like this. I can’t be one of those people that just goes “Just let the doomers terrified of COVID take the vaccine so we can all move on with our lives.”  Everyone needs to be aware of the potential dangers of this vaccine. The dangers that the mainstream media refuse to acknowledge, because TPTB won’t allow it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, do your own research to decide for yourself if this is worth it. We have had too many instances of “trusting the science” too quickly that lead to biological and environmental disasters. I can’t let this be another one of those instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p>TL;DR mRNA vaccine instructs your cells to make protein it doesn’t normally make. Could be malformed. Malformed proteins can lead to prion disease. I don’t trust it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>ETA;</strong> Thank you for the responses and rewards, you guys. I’m no doctor or high-level scientist; I’m just a regular person trying to connect some dots, and most importantly, pose questions that may be overlooked. Am I saying that these vaccines will <strong>definitely</strong> cause prion disease, and that’s that? No! Truthfully, although I made it the big talking point of this post, this is just one potential effect I’ve thought of out of the myriad of things that could go wrong, and perhaps I should have expanded on that more. It makes me uncomfortable knowing how rushed this is, and not knowing if this will be made mandatory or not. The unknowns and risks are simply too much for <strong>me</strong> to personally accept.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t have the authority to say what the side effects are. The most important thing to me is to pose more questions to decide for ourselves if this is really worth the risk.</p></p>

        <p>I recall a doctor invited to speak on the news to give support to the lockdowns and vaccine. He said the RNA vaccine is "theoretically safe". "Theoretically safe". Amazing. No one would drive a car that is only "theoretically safe". It wouldn't even be released to the market if it is only "theoretically safe". And yet people are expected to put this novel thing into their bodies based on "theoretical safety", and have no legal recourse to its manufacturers because these companies will have legal immunity from any suits against them.

        <p>It's only theoretical <em>before</em> it is actually tested. I would not recommend anybody to use it before it has been tested. <em>After</em> that, it won't be just <em>theoretically</em>, it will be <em>practically</em> safe -- or not.</p>

        <p>Haha.  I've been called a deluded conspiracy theorist from the beginning of this by people who were formerly lifelong mates just because I basically said lockdown wasn't the answer and quoted age stratified mortality rates from Italy back in March.  They just slap the label 'conspiracy theorist' on anyone who doesn't agree with everything that is going on.  So yes, if he said this in public, probably the majority would think he was a deluded 'conspiracy theorist'.  Well, I agree with him - this vaccine is way too risky, there are way too many unknowns and to top it off, I'm not at any risk at all from the thing it's meant to protect me from, so I will never be taking this vaccine either.</p>

        <p>Really. Well I hear that vacc will start in December with high priority citizens. Up to April where the gen. population will start.

        <p>I was a enumerator and I didn't know anything about that. I mean how aggressive others are usually when they say leave I leave. Sorry if this was something sinister and for my part in it. Didn't trump shut down the count sometime in the Summer?</p>

        <p>Yes, I totally agree. </p>
<p>I also had a friend that I tried to convince and we managed to stay friends despite being so different. Sk far I haven't even talked to any of my other friends about this topic because I honestly don't want to know.</p>
<p>The one person I trust and still doesn't believe me. Believing that I fell down some weird right wing conspiracy hole instead. A lot of them just never had the chance to access information channels that have been blocked from them. </p>
<p>The friend I talked to and tried to convince also hates corporations but those manufacturing these vaccines are companies. It's like the contradiction is real and they need to really ignore a lot of the things to wrap their head around this. </p>
<p>It's like they're just waiting for it to drop and not exacting any thought or even scrutinizing something that is injected into them and can kill them.</p>
<p>And thinking that the creators are some angels that would never lie and would ensure that it would 100% safe.</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to research and share this information. </p>
<p>I know that the goal of the covid response is not preventing deaths, otherwise we would be banning opiates/alcohol/tobacco, feeding the 9 million people that die a year of hunger, or would have at least had a lockdown/mandatory masks for the TB outbreak that killed 1.5 million people a couple years ago. So if this isn't about a saving people from a virus that you have a 99.9% chance of surviving, what is it about?</p>
<p>Money and power (aka greed and arrogance) are the obvious answers but reducing the population definitely plays into the globalist agenda. A rushed experimental vaccine, forced upon the entirety of the population, in the name of "the worst pandemic the world has ever seen", which goes on to kill its victims in 5-20 years would be an excellent cover for a mass extermination. The companies can say they had no idea and they were forced to rush the vaccine. The governments were just trying to save lives so they let them slide on long term studies.</p>

        <p>From what I have read, the vaccines are more likely to cause disabling diseases than a quick death. Why would the globalists want millions to be disabled with autoimmune or neurological diseases that kill very slowly?</p>

        <p>because holocaust healthcare is here.  we are already seeing the start of it.  </p>
<p>hospitals turning away patients due to mathematical formulas where covid patients are weighted more heavily and that weight increases on a per patient basis(1 covid patient = 1, 2 covid patients = 2.1[very crude example])..  basically, they have the beds, but since covid is around, they have to subtract the amount of available beds from some magic number.  </p>

<p>I will never take this vaccine. I already have enough to contend with neurologically, and with my health in general.</p>
<p>I suffered through a bout of inflammatory disease that lasted a solid three years, only to recover from all of that and summarily be diagnosed with a benign brain tumor. All I want now is to be healthy again and to avoid this sinister vaccine nightmare completely.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the links. The more info we have, the better. I learned about prions during the "mad cow" thing in England some years ago. It is a death sentence. A very unpleasant slow lingering death! I wonder what will happen when their poisonous "vaccine" mutates and what damage it will do. I would also wonder if the vaccined idiots will now be contagious with a DNA altering superbug that even infects those who have not "bent over" for the god of big pharma. I personally have little sympathy for those that develop Myelitis (or whatever) because they were too STUPID and LAZY to do their own research. Long ago, "medicine" proved that it is evil (thalidomide, Cutter Labs polio vaccine, Swine Flue vaccine, DDT etc). Let the politicians be the first guinea pigs! (as they are pigs already)</p>

        <p>Well, we're talking about the possibility that one of its main proteins is a prion which sticks around for years and kills you years later. Even if your immune system fights off the virus, you'd still be exposed to the prion.</p>

<p>I've always suspected that the vaccine will be what actually makes people sick in some way... Everyone will be rushed and forced to get it and everyone will end up sick and dying at one time, whether it's a week after or decades down the road.</p>

        <p>Before addressing some details in the post, I want to make one thing clear: I do not advocate for ubiquitous application of the vaccine, I believe that it will benefit mostly people at risk from a serious disease, and that the general public should vaccinate at will.</p>
<p>However, I particularly dislike the pseudoscientific and conspiratorial tone of the whole post. </p>
<p>The thing about prions is that they are very specific, one misfolded protein may (on rare occasion) induce misfolding, but <em>only</em> to proteins of the same sequence. Lipids don't induce mad cow disease, nor does RNA. </p>
<p>Yes, the cell is tricked into producing a limited amount of a foreign protein, but that's what is required for vaccination. In fact, doing so by mRNA seems safer than introducing the protein made in a foreign agent.</p>
<p>I am not in a hurry to get vaccinated against covid and probably neither should most of us. Don't let this turn into an antivax movement in general though, that's stupid and makes us look like idiots. Just let those who are scared of the covid take their shots first.</p>

        <p>My primary concern is the legal immunity. If the manufacturer <em>knowingly</em> produces even one bad batch, and you are disabled as a result, you have no recourse --add in no healthcare. </p>

        <p>I don't advocate for this vaccine. If anything, it feels rushed. I also don't believe it could possibly give better immunity than the virus itself, especially considering that they have not had the time to test it for long enough.</p>
<p>I only object to making up pseudoscientific stories about it as an excuse. </p>
<p>The swine flu vaccine caused many cases of narcolepsy, and swine flu is actually more dangerous for younger people. Covid-19 is mostly harmless, and if you need an excuse not to get vaccinated, you could probably give an example of the side effects from a recent mass vaccination, instead of telling fairy tales about prions and phosphatidylethanolamine.</p>

        <p>You're exactly right, OP. I hadn't heard about the prion disease part, but definitely saw a huge spike in cancers coming from its mass (mandatory?) distribution. That's a big reason (apart from the fact that's so ridiculously rushed) that I don't trust this vaccine as far as I can throw it.</p>
<p>If the doomers want to be guinea pigs for this shit, that's on them. They'll have to kill me before they test this shit on me.</p>

        <p>I mostly agree with you and am also not going to get a vaccine but here is something that doesn't add up and I wish we can discuss. </p>
<p>It doesn't make sense for tptb to eliminate "their faithful servants" does it? Why would they poison their brainwashed children that were conditioned for such a long time? Now here is my meta conspiracy fear: the vaccine is actually a cure for a disease yet to come, designed to eradicate us the unfaithful naysayers. Does this make sense to any of you?

        <p>With the technology available I don't think TPTB need this many people around anymore. They essentially want China's social credit system but on a global scale. I would imagine once the foundations are set for such a system on a global scale it would require a lot less people for it to be a reality and less chance for any type of uprising from the population.</p>

        <p>It actually makes perfect sense. Ted Kaczynski actually wrote about this possibility in "Industrial Society". </p>
<p>The Oligarchs really have no use for us anymore. They control everything behind the scenes, so even the conflicts between countries is sort of a facade. </p>
<p>There's far too many humans on this planet to efficiently sustain us for a long period of time, and there's even more humans who are inherently suspicious of tptb and have a lot of firearms. This is problematic. </p>
<p>Why keep 6 billion+ humans around when automation has made us largely irrelevant? Especially when you have millions of Europeans around who are "woke" on the Oligarch question. </p>
<p>Their goal is to eradicate us and make it look like an organic phenomenon (plague, war, economic collapse, etc..) so those that they bribe can keep pushing the narrative. </p>

        <p>I went down the rabbit hole of researching acrylamides, and advanced glycation end products and the effect on health.  There are tons of studies now trying to link the consumption of foods containing these compounds or by products ranging from diabetes to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and even autism.  </p>
<p>Also factoring in certain Individuals who have gene mutations that cannot rid the body of these exogenous and endogenous by products , which build over time within the cells and lead to disease.  I suspect that this is where the dangers come from and why so many people have no adverse reactions but a few can have catastrophic adverse effects.  Certain individuals having gene mutations which inhibit their cells ability at ridding waste products would surely suffer with an influx of foreign toxic waste, whether generated from poor food intake or chemicals.  </p>
<p>My research is still new into the subject but there are tons of legitimate studies out there on this very issue.  Most of them are not so exoteric in their interpretations.</p>

        <p>The mRNA is for the  spike protein. If the spike protein is a prion, doesn't that mean getting coronavirus would <em>also</em> give you a prion disease, since the virus has the spike protein in it?</p>
<p>The virus replicates by... hijacking your cells to make more virus. The spike protein in the real virus is <em>also</em> made by your own cells.</p>

        <p>You just really talked everything that told me no. And I just had a friend say that you should go and get it. And he had the ability to tell me that the sources I gave were pro trump and anti vax. That's because they already got rid of it everywhere else. You can't publish it in any mainstream news and he treats it as gospel. </p>
<p>And thinking that I went to some right wing conspiracy. And I look at him, and say just what do you think it is. And again, if it works, why are you so worried that I am not taking this vaccine</p>
<p>And I was just rebutting him all the way that nope, it terrified me, no way in hell I would take the vaccine. It's so safe that the British Government is creating a new AI system to monitor them. And he's like no, it's safe. You mean the billions of dollars they may earn and maybe more if you develop any autoimmune disease. </p>
<p>And I agree too, the only time that it happened was if I'm dead. You just outlined the points they're saying that this works, but it's so experimental that no one knows what it would be like in a couple of years.</p>

        <p>WHO estimated 750m cases by around Oct 1st, at which point there were around 1m recorded deaths.</p>
<p>Many of these deaths were falsely attributed to covid. In fact, despite recording over 3000 cases since May 17th, China has had 0 reported deaths since then.</p>
<p>Even if we take that artificially augmented number of deaths, 1m and divide by the number of cases, 750m, we get a survival rate of:</p>
<p>99.87% and this includes the early deaths where treatment was unknown.</p>
<p>So, by stating a survival rate of "99%", you are increasing the death rate by at least 7.5 times.</p>

        <p>&rt;Perhaps I’m drawing too many conclusions in linking this RNA vaccine to potential prion disease.</p>
<p>This is where I am not seeing the connection you are making.  I agree with everything you say about prions (only thing that scares me more is rabies) and also about the dangers of mRNA vaccines being rushed to market.</p>
<p>But why do you fear a prion disease spawning from these mRNA vaccines specifically?  I am concerned about general adverse vaccine reactions in some significant and unforseen segment of the population, but why is your worry <em>specifically</em> a prion disease?</p>

<p><strong>Moderna:</strong></p>
<p>Moderna started in 2010 by Stéphane Bancel, a first-time biotech CEO. The company is compared to Theranos, and Stéphane Bancel to Elizabeth Holmes. Bancel's experience is in sales and operations, not science. The company is very secretive, had a $5 billion valuation in 2016, and back then, at least a dozen highly placed executives quit, including the heads of finance, technology, manufacturing, and science. In 2015, respected leader's of Moderna's cancer and rare disease programs both resigned. It is even explicitly stated that "The mRNA treatments it's trying to develop are potentially very dangerous".</p>

<p><strong>Pfizer:</strong></p>
<p>Pfizer set a record for the largest health care fraud settlement and the largest criminal fine of any kind with $2.3 billion in 2009. Note: A settlement means that none of the wrongdoing gets released to the public. So, what exactly didn't they want the public to know that cost them $2.3 billion?  Pfizer has had to <a href="https://www.drugwatch.com/fda/recalls/">recall</a> some of its popular products due to quality issues and poor packaging. Effexor XR and Prempro are two products affected by recalls. More recently, the company recalled two lots each of Relpax in 2019 and Duavive in 2020.  Over the years, Pfizer has faced <a href="https://www.drugwatch.com/lawsuits/">lawsuits</a> involving some of its most popular drugs. Courts have dismissed thousands of lawsuits against Pfizer. The company has also agreed to settle cases involving claims of illegal marketing and health care fraud. </p>
<p>Dr. Michael Yeadon is an Allergy &amp; Respiratory Therapeutic Area expert with 23 years in the pharmaceutical industry. He trained as a biochemist and pharmacologist, obtaining his PhD from the University of Surrey (UK) in 1988. He was a former VP of Pfizer, and was the Director of Science. He went forward with evidence that Pfizer committed widespread science fraud in the race for a coronavirus vaccine.</p>

        <p>Interesting. I believe I've been on the same line of thought as you. What do you think of this?: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6403780_Tartaglia_G_G_Pechmann_S_Dobson_C_M_Vendruscolo_M_Life_on_the_edge_a_link_between_gene_expression_levels_and_aggregation_rates_of_human_proteins_Trends_Biochem_Sci_32_204-206</p>
<p>I am reluctant to conclude that it's a danger, because I think the protein has to be misfolded in a specific way at a specific region to be contagious. I also don't know if the extra protein will stick around in the cell long enough to cause a problem. However, this paper does say they suspect there may not be a margin of safety for changes in protein concentration in the cell. That's right in line with what you said here. There's a follow-up paper that may also be relevant.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm glad someone else is looking at this, because it's at least a possibility to consider. It's especially important to think about because of the long incubation time of prison diseases and the fact that they're not going to do long-term testing before using this on everyone. If we can rule it out, great.</p>

        <p>From a conspiracy perspective, inducing mass panic and economic collapse in order to push forth a new type of vaccine is such a perfect plan. </p>
<p>Fear causes people to do irrational things. Theres posters here who say they won't take it because its too soon, that small percentage of fear they have over the rona keeps them from using their common sense. </p>
<p>Not only is this a rushed vaccine for a new strain of coronavirus, but they are using this time to implement brand new vaccine technology that interferes with the most basic of human building blocks, our genetic code. </p>
<p>How that doesn't make people realize this is villain technology doesn't make sense to me. </p>
<p>Our scope and body of knowledge regarding the extremely complex human organism is miniscule compared to how much we dont understand about our own lifeforms. </p>
<p>We still don't have a full grasp of the effects of the vaccines we do use. We have studies that suggest vaccine triggered immune responses are dangerous. We know they contain toxic materials. Yet the general public is not made aware of these risks in the name of "public health" and the father state. </p>
<p>Yet I am expected to be a guinea pig for something that is intruding upon the core of my being? </p>
<p>Add to that I know that if these vaccines cause harmful effects down the line that nobody will touch the research with a 10 foot pole for fear of being ousted from the scientific community? Add to that the fact that any minor effects will be dismissed or downplayed, again in the name of "public health".</p>

        <p>Molecular biologist here. Your core thesis on the vaccine leading to prion formation is misguided I think. You’ve drawn on lots of correct information but not produced a coherent conclusion. You’re correct, an mRNA vaccine uses an RNA molecule that encodes a protein made by the virus that causes COVID-19. You may also be correct about polyanions promoting prion formation. But your cells are jam packed with RNA. They’re making it constantly, it’s critical to keeping you alive, so don’t worry too much about that giving you prion disease otherwise you’ll be up all night worrying! The ribosomes you mentioned that might be harmed by the mRNA vaccine too are also sophisticated nanomachines made of RNA, that’s where the “ribo-“ part of the name comes from. Ribosomes “read” mRNA too, it’s the function they’ve evolved to fulfill, they use the information in the mRNA to build a protein. Interaction between the mRNA in the vaccine is what is intended to occur and is essential for it to work. If the vaccine was detrimental to ribosome function, it wouldn’t work. Hope that clears some stuff up!</p>

        <p>Aren't they worried that as the vaccine is rushed with no human trials, that some longterm effects/ effeciency of the vaccine could be put into question? Especially with legal protection around any potentional side effects/problems that could occur from getting the vaccine. So,what is the likihood that the vaccine could be detrimental to ribosome function, and therefore wouldn't work?</p>

        <p>It should be noted that every single time the author has been infected by a virus, from the flu, to a cold.  He has had his cellular machinery hijacked by said viruses to reproduce themselves in the same exact fashion a mRNA vaccine will be utilized.

        <p>The most probable reason they want to force this vaccin out quickly is that the first one who creates it and makes contracts to sell it will be gaining billions.
I'm not into conspiracies, but if there is foul play then it would probably be more like:
- Reducing non-working population that cost money (retired people)
- Mass production of vaccines, selling a lot for a lot of money
- Getting this mRNA technology approved and tested on humans for later military use (enhancing soldiers, making populations unable to bear children, ect..)</p>
<p>But at this point it feels more like:
- Virus is real and was not intended
- Rushing vaccine because it costs a lot of money to have people not working (lots of people not dying but still not working for weeks or being i  lockdown prevented from work). And also first to sell vaccine gets richest.
- A lot of fear incitement so we can blame all or problems on Covid and forget we were already going towards a major financial crisis.</p>
<p>In any case, I find it humoring when a professor in Biology says it will probably be safe but still says she will not be taking the vaccine herself the first year.</p>

        <p>There's nothing in the above post or the references conclusively linking the vaccines to prion diseases - it looks like guilt by association.  Not all red colored vehicles are firetrucks and the presence of firetrucks and/or red vehicles does not mean there is a fire.  Avoiding red vehicles won't improve fire safety.</p>
<p>My only concern with the vaccine is how fast it was produced and the overall lack of a track record for mRNA vaccines, therapies, and associated treatments in the broader sense.</p>

        <p>Yeah I would never rush to get a brand new vaccine. I want to personally wait a while and side what happens with this. If it is all good sure but if it turns out to be bad I will be thankful for waiting. Plus it is always better to have your own immune system build up natural defenses.</p>
