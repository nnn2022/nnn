    <strong>Convalescent plasma known to cause vaccine evading mutations, still being widely used anyway</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;Writing in Nature, a team led by Cambridge researchers report how <strong>they were able to observe SARS-CoV-2 mutating in the case of an immunocompromised patient treated with convalescent plasma.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Professor Ravi Gupta from the Cambridge Institute of Therapeutic Immunology &amp; Infectious Disease, who led the research, said: <strong>“What we were seeing was essentially a competition between different variants of the virus, and we think it was driven by the convalescent plasma therapy.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;“The virus that eventually won out – which had the D796H mutation and ΔH69/ΔV70 deletions – initially gained the upper hand during convalescent plasma therapy before being overtaken by other strains, but re-emerged when the therapy was resumed. <strong>One of the mutations is in the new UK variant,</strong> though there is no suggestion that our patient was where they first arose.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Given that both vaccines and therapeutics are aimed at the spike protein, which we saw mutate in our patient, our study raises the worrying possibility that the virus could mutate to outwit our vaccines</strong></p>

<p>&rt;<strong>COVID-19 convalescent plasma</strong>, also known as “survivor’s plasma,” contains antibodies, or special proteins, generated by the body’s immune system to the novel coronavirus. <strong>More than 100,000 people in the United States and many more worldwide have already been treated with it since the pandemic began.</strong></p>

<p>&rt;<strong>we will continue to distribute this potentially lifesaving product to hospitals as needed.</strong></p>

        <p>Convalescent plasma being used with remdesivir. That new drug probably attacks the immune system , too. I mean why would big pharma stop their money making machine by giving us something that is actually healthful/helpful.</p>

        <p>Incorrect.  Read the article.  They said there was no change with remdesivir.  The mutations only happened with convalescent plasma.</p>
<p>Or even just read the areas I bolded if you don't want to read the article.</p>

        <p>I read the article. I know the drug is dangerous. In my mind it could be a further attack on the compromised immune system by a toxic drug or the plasma containing what should be antibodies. If it's the recovered plasma causing further sickness than that's proof for me this cd19 was made in lab, it is bioweapon. And I say this knowing cd19 has never been purified and isolated</p>

        <p>I appreciate it but I understand you being cynical when critical thinkers are attacked from all sides, it's hard to know who's being real. And my reply definitely could go in r/conspiracy, but it ended up here. It aligns for me the toxic HIV drugs decades back pushed for massive gains. Have you seen this gem?

        <p>Thanks.  I appreciate your kind response.  When I started thinking about it after, I thought you probably do have a point about remdesivir. And your comment did make sense.  I just read it too fast and from the standpoint of already having made up my mind about something and so I was just talking nonsense.</p>
<p>I'm interested in to hear what the document is about?  Can you give a summary?  I'm a little bit hesitant to download something.</p>

        <p>It's an amazing read. Goes all the way in to the history and protocol for viruses, effects of profound stress , placebo and nocebo, I was especially fascinated not knowing much about the h1v and how that came about as a virus, needing toxic drugs to sustain life,  yet it was aid5 that killed and we, I believed that wholeheartedly, to me a positive diagnosis would have been a death sentence on its own, so was the story told and fear mongered on us. The effect on the mind profound <em>before</em> the toxic AZT drug even administered. The parallels are there, to here, now and that same fu#k fãuci behind that sham, too. It's also written in a way that's not overwhelming, easily understood despite its absolute wealth of data and unfortunate need to be written and shared and actioned.</p>
<p>I have compassion for those that don't see it, I try to help them on vaxinjűry subs but I'm constantly banned. Most I reach out to in dms are grateful and receptive and it's true they probably happily lined up to 'help the greater good' as is the mantra. They were lied to and deceived and my heart breaks for all of them as they discover they're shunned and denied , unheard by the same doctors that pushed the neědle on them</p>
