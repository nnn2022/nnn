    <strong>Enlightened Connections</strong>
    <p><p>We need to reach out to spiritual figures to get an oomph behind what we are saying. People in these realms have a higher consciousness and can begin to decipher what is true and what is not true along with what is said and what is not said unbiased and clear for the masses to understand. They have a beauty of speaking what most people can't express. They have a beauty of having people listen while not getting attached to selective hearing because of the smoothness and clarity of their words. Please reach out to a spiritual figure if you know one that touches you with their words or that makes it clear to you that they are genuine and want the best for the world. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Gandhi had such an impact on the world because of his words. If people with clarity are made to speak on this issue after seeing the ideas that we have presented it could do great good and could save so many people in the future.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you are scared, realize there are people that have been working their whole lives to become genuine enlightened people that could help us in this grave time of danger. Please reach out to them over social media if they are on social media leaving multiple comments telling them to do research on the anti-vax side or calling their locations or areas where they provide expertise.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These are some of the most unbiased people in the world that can spread wisdom. We can't live in fear and fear is deciphered by clarity and understanding. If someone with clarity and understanding speaks out, they can speak to the soul</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you are to tell them about this anti-vax side in detail or to possibly make them aware of what the U.S is going through that would be better than them not knowing about the inner workings of media manipulation through corruption until they research. This could be just enough for the saving of the lives of so many people. If what we are going through right now is a time crunch we need to control our fate and recognize our time. Spread the news</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>SHARE THIS POST EVERYWHERE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND PRESERVATION OF THE SOUL</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>IT IS BETTER THAN US LIVING IN FEAR IN A CORNER OF THE INTERNET ON REDDIT. THIS SHOULD KNOWN BY ENLIGHTENED FRIENDS OF THE WORLD</p></p>

        <p>YES!!! I believe Barbara Hand Clow is one of these people. I really resonate with her. She is giving interviews now! She is an astrologer (among other things) and was trained in the ancient wisdom of the Cherokee oral tradition by her grandmother. I LOVED THIS INTERVIEW SHE DID IN MAY: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piBA8TgIHYE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piBA8TgIHYE</a></p>
<p>Even if you aren't into astrology, hopefully you can understand what she is trying to convey!</p>
