    <strong>I sent this to Alberta's premier (Kenney) and my local MPP two weeks ago. No response. Not surprised. Looks like the Tree of Liberty is gonna need watering soon...</strong>
    <p><p>Mr. Kenney, </p>
<p>I  note from reading Dan Braid's article in the National Post this morning  that you are facing a revolt from your cabinet over the latest round of  draconian lockdown measures.  </p>
<p>It's bloody well about time.  </p>
<p>You  will soon face one at the ballot box from those of us who voted for you  last election to end the government overreach, arrogance, and  wastefulness of the Notley regime. It's time to stop listening to social  media hysterics, corporations and businesses making bank off of this  overblown "pandemic", and those who would sell their liberties out for a  monthly government cheque. </p>
<p>I  don't recall electing Deena Hinshaw to any office in this province. I  don't recall anywhere in our Bill of Rights, Constitution, or Charter  that gives medical bureaucrats carte blanche to dictate public policy  over the heads of our elected representatives - and those of us who  elected them. </p>
<p>If  someone had told me even ten years ago that unelected officials such as  Ms. Hinshaw would be dictating where I can go, when and where I may  shop, that I may worship God only at the Government's pleasure, and how  many people I may have in my own home, I would have not believed it. Now  it is daily life in the dystopia this province (and the world as a  whole) has become. How has it come to this? </p>
<p>You  were elected to stand up for ordinary Albertans. Start doing it. Stop  being a cats-paw of Justin Trudeau, the WEF, and those who are using  this overblown flu bug to destroy the middle class, usher in  technocracy, and gut our hard-won liberties. </p>
<p>The  clock is ticking. People everywhere are finally beginning to question  the rigged PCR tests, the cooked death statistics, the lockstep hysteria  of the news media. Even those who meekly complied with masks, "social"  distancing, and lockdowns are balking at the  drive towards a rushed, needless (for most) vaccine that will be coerced  upon us by "private businesses deciding" that we all must have a  "vaccine passport" to live as normal human beings. </p>
<p>Note  that the countries and US states that have forgone turning their  citizens into muzzled prisoners have done at least as well (or better in  most cases) than those, like Canada, who have relished ruling their  locked-down minions by decree. Surely you and your ministers can see  this - if you wish to. </p>
<p>Stop  listening to bureaucrats who are only parroting the lines given them by  WHO and other NGOs. Stop listening to those who, in their irrational  fear, would destroy our society "to save one life".  </p>
<p>Time is running out. We are watching. And waiting. </p></p>

        <p>That's less of a concern in Canada than usa, because arms have already been heavily restricted there. It's in the works in the United states, obviously. But the trees need for water is being felt everywhere, cause even where we have weapons, there is but little to feed them in the stores...</p>
