    <strong>The growing spiritual darkness of the vaccines: "You will have to submit you know"</strong>
    <p><p>I am very disabled, with multiple autoimmune problems that include CFS and I am near deaf as a result, that is just two problems. I believe the vaccines would kill me, either short term or long term. Spiritually I believe they are evil [transhumanism, past Christian fundamentalist beliefs] Sadly I do have a pro-vacc doctor who signed up for Moderna. </p>
<p>Two things happened to me....some people I know who had bad side effects, tingling and nerve pain on first dose, I did try to talk to, they still believe in the vaccines, their choice but that threw me off, I did provide links, most scientific ones I could, they refused to look at boards and lists of side effects calling it "ancedotal". I said to one if all reports of side effects are rejected, and they didn't even trust VAERS saying anyone could post on there, I said whose collecting this data and where will we be without it? I don't think they will respond, and I am going to drop the topic. It scares me that people can get serious side effects and still support the vaccines, psychologically I don't understand that. </p>
<p>The second friend who is online friend, I thought was more conservative, she was even a Trump supporter, went to go get the vaccination, and she needed to call 9-11, extreme fever, weakness etc, for days on the first dose, I talked to her but she went to go get the second dose. I think she has some problems still, but has accepted it, she's disabled too. She just wrote me and told me basically I will have to submit, they aren't going to let you in stores, you have to take the vaccines to have a life.</p>
<p>She wrote me, "you are talking about "vaccines" like you can just not take them. I don't think you don't realize you can't just do what
you want anymore that freedom is over, freedom in general is over.</p>
<p>She added to this that my doctors are probably going to start refusing to treat me and that I may be stuck alone in my apartment the rest of my life. </p>
<p>You know they can make me afraid all they want, I still refuse. I already decided I would have whatever happen then have people make me into a medical experiment and to "own me".</p>
<p>The spiritual darkness with all this I am seeing [whatever your religion] is to the extreme. The hatred for the disabled is there too. I have kept my mouth shut with most people outside of online anonymous forums outside a few online conspiracy minded friends everyone is brainwashed.</p></p>

        <p>I'm sorry that you don't have more support for your decision not to vaccinate. I don't know you, but I applaud your bravery and hope you continue to do what is right for you. </p>
<p>I have turns more toward religion now. It makes more and more sense each day. I feel sorry for those that are being manipulated, but we have free will. They chose to allow these institutions to manipulate them. </p>
<p>Keep doing what you're doing. And you are most certainly not alone! We are all with you. United against this tyranny!</p>

        <p>Religiously I am in a strange place. I deconverted, but then what does it mean that spiritually I have been told TOO not to take this poison like spirit inside saying DO NOT DO IT. I agree with turns towards spirituality or religion, my beliefs may be different then before, but there is evil and good and well this is evil.  I do think people make a choice too to be manipulated or to turn away from the light. I am glad to have people here to talk to, there is no one in real life, outside of husband.</p>

        <p>Maybe you need to do some soul searching.  I don't mean that in a mean way. I grew up believing in God and then after I lost so much when my home and car were destroyed in a flood I tried going to church but I couldn't feel God. I started thinking maybe there was no God. I had to pull myself together so I gave up on church and God but I wasnt ready to become atheist.  I didnt know what I believed and just hoped one day I would have the clarity to figure it out.  Fast forward 3 years later and this virus hit. I was watching "out of shadows" documentary someone sent me. The hurricane,  the virus, etc everything started falling into place.  I do believe God is very real now. I believe Satan has been taking over and that's why I couldn't feel God anymore. But the day is coming we all choose one. And I'm sure as hell not gonna get stuck in eternity with Satan.  I prayed for guidance and I am so glad I didnt take that vaccine.</p>

        <p>I probably won't return to Christian fundamentalism, but I do believe there is a God, and there is good and evil in the world. Someone can call it a Source etc. I am noticing a divide even in other religions like some New Agers are warning the vaccine is evil, so that's interesting. I do think Jesus taught many good things, and I do think the Bible warns of some truths though religion and empire became adulterated.</p>
<p>I will look up the out of shadows documentary. I think the world is growing far more evil too. I got beaten down by life, and my prayers were never answered, so that impacted me religiously. I also encountered extreme spiritual abuse. I do believe "evil" has taken over a lot of religious circles and preached most churches were fallen away when I was still fundamentalist. maybe some of you would call that the "antichrist".</p>
<p>Sorry you felt like God didn't care anymore either. I'm not sure what to think now. I'm in a strange place, I am being told by whatever divine force or God there is not to take the vaccine. Even my former Christian fundamentalist studies of transhumanism told me how wrong the vaccines are, and how it gives "OUTSIDE CONTROL". </p>
<p>I have deep concerns my liberal religious circles lined up for the vacc so unyieldingly, even people who were young and in little danger from Covid, I am not sure what to think now. I was disowned by all Christian fundamentalist friends and circles. I can't go back to abuse and other spiritual oppressions. I hope whatever God there is helps us all.</p>

        <p>I admire your strength. I too have decided I will not get that poison in me. I will submit myself to death 1000 times over rather then get that poison and to live in that system.</p>
<p>Now I train myself, not to some how miraculously survive whatever hell the future has in store but to make sure I don't fold on my own principles and break. </p>

        <p>My advice is to not listen to fearmongering from this person. We have enough fear around. And also, do not try and understand these people. It is a painful, fruitless, waste of time. I wish I could do this myself. I spend so much energy and emotion trying to understand and it hurts. Never give up or stop being true to yourself! You are a very strong person, and you will find there are many others with similar beliefs that will support you!</p>

        <p>I hope I can find someone of my beliefs locally, I am very isolated. This pandemic outside of my husband has destroyed any social life I once had off line and that was limited to begin with. I am tired of the fear too, I think you are right. I am closing down conversation with more of them faster and quicker, useless to argue with people with full blinders on. Thanks for saying I am strong.</p>

        <p>That is great you have your husband. I do not have a mate and I have parted ways with many friends over this. I feel extremely isolated as well. I think there are lots of people in this boat! Even if you go to <a href="https://Meetups.com">Meetups.com</a> everything is on ZOOM now. Church is mostly on ZOOM (where I am).

        <p>The disdain among these types is usually a projection, which is weird. There are people who project on those they have ill will toward, and there are people who don't have ill will. If you think people should be able to make their own decisions, you are already a completely different disposition than these brainwashed hylics. I consider it worse than Nazism on their part. Removing all freedoms and bodily autonomy for the entirety of humanity is the worst possible atrocity short of nuking the planet.</p>

One person simply refused to look at any side effects boards, that's showing a major problem. We have lost so many freedoms and bodily autonomy as well.

        <p>Forced submission has been coming a loooooooong time. </p>
<p>&rt;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you. <em>Hebrews 13:17.</em></p>
<p>&rt;Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. <em>Romans 13:1</em></p>
<p><strong>"Spiritually I believe they are evil"</strong> </p>
<p>It's never too late to join the fight against tyranny. </p>
<p>&rt;“You will not certainly die,” the Serpent said to the woman. “For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it. <em>Genesis 3:4-6</em></p>
<p>&rt;Souls who dare use their immortality–– Souls who dare look the Omnipotent tyrant in His everlasting face, and tell him that His evil is not good! If he has made, As he saith––which I know not, nor believe–– But, if he made us––he cannot unmake: We are immortal!––nay, he'd have us so, That he may torture:––let him! He is great–– But, in his greatness, is no happier than We in our conflict! Goodness would not make Evil; and what else hath he made? But let him Sit on his vast and solitary throne–– Creating worlds, to make eternity Less burthensome to his immense existence And unparticipated solitude; Let him crowd orb on orb: he is alone Indefinite, Indissoluble Tyrant; Could he but crush himself, 'twere the best boon He ever granted: but let him reign on! And multiply himself in misery! Spirits and Men, at least we sympathise–– And, suffering in concert, make our pangs Innumerable, more endurable, By the unbounded sympathy of all With all! But He! so wretched in his height, So restless in his wretchedness, must still Create, and re–create–<em>Lord Byron</em></p>

        <p>I think Romans 13 is misused. I used to be a fundamentalist Christian, deconverted, know the bible through and throught. The greek seems to point more to heavenly bodies for "leaders" in that scripture then leaders in the earthly sense. LOL I used to go look up Greek and Hebrew a lot, on bible verses. It does look like your beliefs matched mine then, where you saw authorities as God [or heavenly bodies] I did do a writings on the old religious blog on that matter more than once. Thanks for the Bryon quote.</p>

        <p>I was born without kidneys and am on peritoneal dialysis. </p>
<p>I received a pneumonia vaccine about two years ago and had a grand mal seizure right there on the floor in front of the nurse. It was so bad I soiled myself and thought I was dead. Nurse said she thought I was going to die as well. Never had a seizure before that. </p>
<p>My doctor is telling me to get the vaccine. I am on the kidney transplant list but there’s no way I can be on immuno suppressant drugs with what’s going on. Then there’s the vaccine shedding that may or may not be happening. It’s suicide. </p>
<p>So here I am facing my own demise. It’s only a matter of time. I’ve come to terms with it and my main mission is to help others while I’m still here. I’ll do what I can for others by stocking supplies. It’s all for them now. </p>
<p>God bless.</p>

        <p>Wow sorry you are facing that and needing dialysis you are dependent on the system too to survive, I am too but that is more intense. Yeah other vaccines one can have side effects though one thing they are noticing these vaccines are causing far more and the death rate has skyrocketed. Yeah the vaccine/spike protein shedding is freaking me out. I decided not to visit some people because of this. I am supposed to be on immuno suppressants but due to other health problems they are delayed but if the condition advances that I get blood tests for every 6 months I will be forced on them. I think about what this could do my immune system. [one my condition is a connective tissue disorder related to lupus that can progress into ful lupus] Something is going wrong with my kidneys, failure to sarcoidosis, more parathyroid problems? They don't know yet. The ableism out there has been horrifying, as much medical pain and suffering as people like us have dealt with they want us to sign up for more. I am glad you came out of the seizure. Oh I am seeing seizures as side of effects of these covid vaccines. No one is going to care or pay your medical bills too once someone gets sick from these vaccines.</p>

        <p>The friendship has been on edge for some time. We fought over politics but she was the more conservative but now it seems like she's a statist. The people with side effects are more acquaintances from a group, casual folks, so there's lower expectations. Telling me I have to line up, has freaked me out.</p>

        <p>This will certainly be a very lonely road for us who will keep strong and go against the current. And they are also hard times (spiritually), what was called a " dark night of the soul". But in the end, submitting to this absolute madness will be much, much worse.</p>
<p>I really believe that God will be with us in the end. It will be hard, but we'll make it one way or another. It is clear by now that what's going on is unprecedented and that many will be lost ( by their own will). Many will hate us and as Jesus said,  sometimes they may even kill us and believe they do it for God ( replace God with safety,  health, the greater good, etc).</p>
<p>But while we are so far away from each other ( physically), I think the fact that we are united in spirit is what truly matters. We are literally living a spiritual war, but we'll make it. And you are not alone. Take care, pray and hang in there!</p>

        <p>I am in the same boat as a long covid patient (that has a lot of things in common with CFS). 
I already had Covid and I am really scared of this vaccine after all the reports I read.</p>
<p>It's weird because some long covid patients improved after the vaccine (!) but some got worse. Really worse. Guess what's reporting the media? Obviously, the success cases. </p>
<p>Honestly, as medicine has little to nothing to offer to our conditions, I wouldn't miss my useless appointments at all. They just don't know neither care about CFS and long covid. 
Vaccines for traveling or buying crap that I don't need? The world is going to be a really dark place anyway.</p>

        <p>You probably have antibiodies too. I find myself thinking this covid crap was lab created because the usual norm of long lasting antibiodies seems to have been uprooted well unless they are lying about that too. I think they are lying about the long covid patients doing better, that's my take on it.  Yeah no one cares about CFS even getting diagnosed is difficult.</p>
