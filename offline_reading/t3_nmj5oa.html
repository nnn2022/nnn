    <strong>The Issue of Normalization, Justification, and Labels</strong>
    <p><p>"Hey guys, I got my first dose of Pfizer^TM 4 months ago and wanted to share my truth.  Approximately 2 minutes after doing my part for society, my face and all four limbs went numb and I briefly passed out for 45 minutes, waking up in a puddle of vomit and soiled pants.  Walking to my vehicle was a real task with the world spinning around me, but luckily I made it before passing out for another 25 minutes.  I ended up taking a cab home because who wants to drive with blurry vission and dizziness. I didn't sleep for a single minute throughout the next 72 hours as i tossed and turned in a literal hell of a 105 F fever, stinging pains, and a sheering migraine.  I now also have permanent heart issues and haven't had my period in over 4 months since my jab.</p>
<p>To clarify, I am NOT antivaxx and do NOT regret taking this shot because I care about other people. I won't be getting the second shot because fuck that shit, but I really don't want to discourage anyone from getting vaccinated."</p>
<p>Ok that was slighlty exagerated, but is a basic summary of posts on /covidvaccinated that haven't gotten censored.  As the title says, there is a major issue with people nowadays and their need to justify their actions and avoid being labled.  Not taking an experimental shot does NOT make you an antivaxxer. What the fuck is wrong with people? There is very little actual human thought going on, so much so that I literally notice every time I hear anyone voice a legitimate opinion that hasn't been straight up regurgitated from the MSM.</p>
<p>I don't know how to wake people up anymore, I feel like many are too far gone to the point where they literally can't wake up, because that would mean accepting that their reality is not legit and that they, being a super smart self thinking individual, have been duped.  Sorry for the rant peeps, I'm a little peeved.</p></p>

        <p>My personality actually changed after five minutes of having the Pfizer in me. Had to declare myself spiritually sovereign and free to get my soul back. I mean it disrupts you from feeling your higher self</p>
