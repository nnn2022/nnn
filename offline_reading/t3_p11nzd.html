    <strong>Is there anywhere reliable left that we can have open Covid debate and discussion we're people are allowed to think entirely for themselves?</strong>
    <p><p>Personally Ive had my vaccine but some of the figures and data out there are actually quite concerning and have me really trying to get information that isnt necessarily from mainstream western media... all i want is clear cold undeniable facts, referenced data sources with reliable info that allows me to really lockdown where the truth lies.  </p>
<p>I know how that sounds, and I get that misinformation is dangerous indeed, but is there anywhere where we're allowed to be completely in control of what we read and be enabled to seek out the information ourselves to conclude things ourselves? Im kind of just sick of being so 'Nannied' for a better word by people that have decided that Vaccines and lockdown are good/responsible. (Im in Australia on like month 3 of lockdown #2).  </p>
<p>I feel like everywhere now is censoring in every angle that isnt government approved... from reddit to facebook to media outlets to everywhere in between... moderators are shutting it all down as soon anyone like an anti vaxxer tries to post an opinion...   </p>
<p>Im actually worried that shutting everything that isnt socially approved down is leading to people feeling scared to discuss their views and actually leads to greater division rather than helps to build trust between both sides of the argument...   </p>
<p>Its really weird to me, because some very smart Doctors in my wider friends circle are chatting on Facebook private group atm that has me increasingly worried about the vaccine safety... and these are people with some solid credentials... and theyre getting skinned alive for questioning the way the lockdown is being handled and the suggesting the vaccines are higher risk than the public are being told.... their credentials are pretty solid as far as I can tell... and they conflict with what our marketing guy / President of Australia is saying (Scotty from marketing).</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine is potentially harmful, the spike protein specifically is linked to inflammation of the pulmonary endothelial cells. This is because the spike protein binds to the bodies ace2 receptors and activates them. This leads to pulmonary hypertension which as a high mortality rate and is known as the silent killer. 50-60% of patients die within 3 years of diagnosis. Here is my supporting evidence. </p>

        <p>What is the point you are making that these studies support? It would be helpful to all if you stated your argument, summarized it, and then provided the sources as evidence. I'm sure I'd agree with you, but the majority of people will not click on the links without a short blurb about the central point.</p>

        <p>Thank you! It's so bizarre that people can't publicly have this discussion when scientists are doing the research. The truth is most medical treatments and pharmaceuticals have side effects. This should be brought to the light so people can make informed decisions.</p>

        <p>Cant say I blame you.</p>
<p>Vaccines are so full of information and disinformation right now (I think its on purpose really)</p>
<p>That is almost impossible for us to research them. First of the companies that produced them wont say anything and the governments are under strict contracts and mainstream media are nothing more then a public relation department for big pharma</p>
<p>The only fact I can give you 100% is we got no longterm safety data on the vaccines. </p>
<p>ThatÂ´s it.</p>
