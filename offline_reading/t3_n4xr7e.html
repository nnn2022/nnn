        <p>You can understand the bullshit behind media reporting, though. People hang off the sides of overfilled trams over there and shit in the streets, collecting straws for recycling from garbage rivers. If COVID was a real deal India would be ground zero for a very high per capita infection/death rate like 12 months ago. However this is emergent reporting.</p>
<p>Now the US has a surplus of vaccines because we're reaching the limit of willing receivers. There is an expiration date on the vaccines so I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing reports that we're being "humanitarian" by selling our excess to India soon.</p>

        <p>India isn't some shithole where everybody wallows in squalor. They have plumbing, regular jobs, etc. The reason you can't compare a city to a whole country is that the country has a lot of less densely populated areas where COVID just won't spread well. Look at Idaho for an example, they have very few restrictions but only have really had bad outbreaks in Boise, but it's not because COVID isn't bad, it's because people are so spread out.</p>

        <p>Over 20% of the population lives well below the poverty line. People do have to live in filthy, unhealthy conditions. It only takes one person with a mutation to start a pandemic, truly. Combine that with an extremely high population density and poor infrastructure, and India is one of the biggest breeding grounds for new strains of anything. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Look at the cases of influenza and rona. The CDC, which the media stopped listening to after they said no masks, has reported "less than one tenth of the cases reported during the low-severity season" for the entire duration. Seriously.</p>

        <p>No I understood and I think I agree with you, except Quebec is a province and not a city. I was augmenting my thoughts towards your response but I don't think the OP was in the complete wrong here. Quebec has a lot of low density areas as well, but the idea that we should all freak out because India has a "surprise" upsurge in cases is ignorant. </p>
<p>If really the issue is one city in Quebec than the problem is even worse! As countless square miles of non-affected people are getting a cookie-cutter approach to lockdown restrictions that may not have ever, or will ever, make any difference for them.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns, social distancing, masks, all that stuff absolutely works. The proof is in the numbers.</p>
<p>Obviously this place loves misrepresenting the numbers so you have to look at them correctly.</p>
<p>You can't compare two places, such as New York and Texas, because, they are two different places. The virus hit first and harder in New York. Tourism and the movement of people, and the population density all played a massive part.</p>
<p>So comparing places to each other doesn't work.</p>
<p>Every single place that had no restrictions or eased them too quickly, such as Sweden and India, have much much higher numbers now than they would have otherwise. Texas and Florida will find this out soon. It takes time for the numbers to increase, there is a lag but it'll happen.</p>
<p>Every place that had restrictions has seen numbers reduce. Again, it's important to compare numbers properly. You can't compare January to April, because of course that will show a decrease. The winter is worse. But by comparing January to January, or, in this case, April to April, you'll see the huge downward trend.</p>
<p>Every respected medical institute in the world recommends masks, distancing and vaccines. All of them recommended some form of lockdown, either full or targeted. There is obviously debate about how long a lockdown should last to minimise economic harm and that's a fair debate, but some form of lockdown for a period of time has been shown to stop a huge increase from getting worse.</p>
<p>Even the places that Texas and Florida, who frankly haven't got the best reputations for being clever, will absolutely lockdown if their numbers reach a certain level. It is the only thing that works at that stage. And you can remember this, I think they are only about a month away from being in that position, unless vaccine take up increases. If it does, you might just avoid it.</p>

        <p>You'd better have a great collection of sources to make such a bold claim that flies in the face of the findings of <a href="https://thefatemperor.com/published-papers-and-data-on-lockdown-weak-efficacy-and-lockdown-huge-harms/">several dozen studies</a> all showing no correlation - let alone causation - between lockdown stringency and COVID mortality worldwide.</p>
<p>There's a reason why not a single official pandemic guidelines/playbook prior to 2020 advised for lockdowns, widespread masking, border closures, etc. WHO's 2019 pandemic guidelines (ie: the culmination of decades of epidemiological knowledge, also linked above) didn't even advise for the isolation of exposed individuals, LET ALONE the entire healthy population, <em>just in case.</em></p>
<p>Lockdowns were a novel social experiment and all the data shows they didn't work.</p>

        <p>Sure, but its going to be very limited explanation with links to learn more. Ct = cycle threshold</p>
<p>The PCR tests work by multiplying RNA until it can be detected by chemicals that glow when molecules are present.</p>
<p>Each cycle doubles the amount of genetic material previously present: 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. but - much larger numbers of molecules - trillions</p>
<p>A common PCR Ct might be 20-23 or even 25 or 26 for some tests (depends on many factors). </p>
<p>PCR Ct above 35ish becomes very unreliable noise. Remember, 35 is TWICE 34 and 1000x 25! (it is exponential). </p>
<p>Anyway, now that is probably enough, you can see that we can know that a 'positive' that did not go positive until CT 36+ is complete noise and can be simply thrown out. And also a 'case' that is based on Ct from say 28 to 36 is fairly unreliable.</p>
<p>CDC\WHO refuse to tell us the Ct for the positives. They claim it is useless or misleading or confusing or a million other excuses. This is absurd to most.</p>
<p>Here is a link about PCR: <a href="https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-how-pcr-works">https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/explainer-how-pcr-works</a></p>
<p>And below are a few more links about the topic of Ct in the covid testing:</p>

<p><strong>Infectious Diseases Society of America:</strong> ‚ÄòCycle threshold above 35 drops PCR test accuracy to &lt;3%‚Äô</p>

<p><strong>European Journal of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases:</strong> PCR test only 12% accurate at Ct values of 33</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is of paramount importance to define when a treated patient can be considered as no longer contagious. Correlation between successful isolation of virus in cell culture and Ct value of quantitative RT-PCR targeting E gene suggests that patients with Ct above 33‚Äì34 using our RT-PCR system are not contagious and thus can be discharged from hospital care or strict confinement for non-hospitalized patients.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSamples with Ct values of 13‚Äì17 all led to positive culture. Culture positivity rate then decreased progressively according to Ct values to reach 12% at 33 Ct. No culture was obtained from samples with Ct &rt;‚Äâ34.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, Oxford University:</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúData are sparse on how the PCR results relate to viral culture results. There is some evidence of a relationship between the time from collection of a specimen to test, symptom severity and the chances that someone is infectious.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúPCR detection of viruses is helpful so long as its limitations are understood; while it detects RNA in minute quantities, caution needs to be applied to the results as it often does not detect infectious virus.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>The Lancet:</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúOur findings suggest that, although patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection might have prolonged RNA shedding of up to 83 days in upper respiratory tract infection, no live virus was isolated from culture beyond day 9 of symptoms despite persistently high viral RNA loads.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur study shows that despite evidence of prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in respiratory and stool samples, viable virus appears to be short-lived. Therefore, RNA detection cannot be used to infer infectiousness.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Cornell University Preprint:</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúUnlike previous epidemics, in addressing COVID-19 nearly all international health organizations and national health ministries have treated a single positive result from a PCR-based test as confirmation of infection, even in asymptomatic persons without any history of exposure. This is based on a widespread belief that positive results in these tests are highly reliable. However, data on PCR-based tests for similar viruses show that PCR-based testing produces enough false positive results to make positive results highly unreliable over a broad range of real-world scenarios. <em>This has clinical and case management implications, and affects an array of epidemiological statistics, including the asymptomatic ratio, prevalence, and hospitalization and death rates.</em> Steps should be taken to raise awareness of false positives, reduce their frequency, and mitigate their effects. In the interim, positive results in asymptomatic individuals that haven't been confirmed by a second test should be considered suspect.‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Oxford University Study:</strong></p>
<p>‚ÄúProspective routine testing of reference and culture specimens are necessary for each country involved in the pandemic to establish the usefulness and reliability of PCR for Covid-19 and its relation to patient factors. Infectivity is related to the date of onset of symptoms and cycle threshold level. <em>A binary Yes / No approach to the interpretation RT-PCR unvalidated against viral culture will result in false positives with possible segregation of large numbers of people who are no longer infectious and hence not a threat to public health</em>.‚Äù</p>
