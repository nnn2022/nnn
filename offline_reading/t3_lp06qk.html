    <strong>How are the users of this sub regarding these things?</strong>
    <p><p>There are a lot of people who have been anti-maskers and the likes, who got sick and then switched their tune up. How do you guys feel about these people, and their change of heart? </p>
<p>Some are even pretty noteworthy people. I just really want to understand what it is you guys all think you have figured out here. I'd like to engage in good faith, some of comments here are full of vitriol and I can't lie and say it doesn't bother me on some emotional level what this sub is dedicated to.</p>
<p>I see a lot of arguments against covid measures that are using the working class as their reason. I don't believe many of those proponents of those kinds of arguments are actually supporters of the working class though.</p></p>

        <p>Been sick survived. Masks are a token gesture to reassure the fearful, there’s no evidence on their efficacy. I’m mostly pissed at the unprecedented quarantine and dismantling of people’s livelihoods over what for most is a non event. </p>
<p>When all the media who have done nothing but lie to you for your entire life all start singing from the same book, something untrustworthy is afoot. </p>
<p>Iraq war anyone? WMD?
There’s too much reasonable counter debate being silenced for anything to be trustworthy.
Too many grand global plans being put into action immediately off the back of this; I know the virus is real, but it’s being false flagged and any idiot should be able to see that.</p>
<p>Lack of rational debate, just censoring, I know doctors who are on my side of this but keep their public mouth shut. The only people I know in real life who are down with all this work in Walmart/Asda and never had any aspirations anyway, or a decent IQ.</p>

        <p>There is plenty of evidence, dating back to far before the pandemic began on masks efficacy for reducing spread of similar disease. I mean they are a key part of PPE for a reason, they work. Compliance with masks is low, but masks do work, that's simply not up for debate. I hear a lot of "No evidence it works on Covid Though!", which at the beginning ofc there was no peer reviewed analysis of that. Now though you can easily find info about efficacy regarding covid as well. Glad you recovered, here's hoping you have no lasting damage. </p>
<p>The media has completely lied to me my whole life, I'm not going to assume they don't, I'm not going to assume that covid hasn't been politicized, or that there aren't opportunists in powerful positions. When it comes down to it the media alone shouldn't be where you base all your information from, make sure it is reliable, info is coming from specialists in related medical fields, even ones with less ties to interest groups or bureaucracy. Iraq/WMD was in my youth, so I can't recall the climate at the time, only by looking back at history can I better understand it. I don't see the similarities in the way you do, I think it's probably convenient though in order to give credence to your ideas.</p>
<p>Why should there be, and if there should what should this "rational debate" be about? I mean, if by rational debate you mean debating the efficacy of masks, or the danger of this disease, or lockdown measures whatever none of that seems a rational response to what has happened. What I would find to be rational would be beginning from a point of wanting to stop the virus' spread and debating how exactly to support those who will be hurt by the measures to slow spread. My guess is a lot of anti-covid sentiment is actually from disgruntled workers who have always felt taken advantage, but are now being treated as one hundred percent expendable by both their employers and political leaders. The kind of folks who probably pride themselves on their ability to "make it on their own", which in the developed world is kind of a joke anyways. So, that ability being gone, the disdain for "laziness", "fear", "handouts", and those things along with the conspiratorial thinking, and previous instances of being straight fucked as part of the working class leads us here. In reality I think this is very very misguided and workers who are upset should direct their anger where it belongs, which is definitely not covid measures.</p>

        <p>The preponderance of mask data clearly show that community mask wearing does not slow respiratory viral spread. These data have been accumulating in standard and respected medical journals for decades. Unfortunately your mask opinion has been canonized despite no evidence supporting the position.</p>

        <p>Rational debate- lock up the vulnerable? Allow herd immunity to prevail in the healthy lowering total morbidity ( as evidenced in non lockdown nations)</p>
<p>Why would you believe someone who consistently lies to you for their own agenda? The media is owned by the CIA etc that’s not even up for debate.</p>
<p>There is literally zero correlation on mask efficacy in an airborn virus. The armed forces are not taking this seriously, if there was a real biohazard they would be locked down in full hazmat suits, which are a bit more effective than your nans  stockings.</p>
<p>Damn right I recovered along with everyone else I knew or came into contact with, 100% transmission rate, but here’s the kicker-100% survival rate among the people who I gave it to and who gave it to me and mine. Zero long term impact.</p>
<p>I know a young father who suicided at the loss of his job due to restrictions.</p>
<p>I know a mother age 36 who couldn’t be diagnosed with breast cancer who now has a death sentence and 2 young children.</p>
<p>So that’s 3 infants without parents due to government reactions. And zero to the virus.</p>
<p>You know those specialists you talk off? You know the guy who modelled 
It in the U.K. fucked up on an epic scale several times before? Foot and mouth? 2010flu? </p>
<p>You know the WHO tried this same model in 2010, and ended up in court over it?</p>
<p>You know the WHO wanted Fucking MUGABE as a goodwill ambassador? Fuck those specialists.</p>
<p>Mortality across Europe is in line with every year on date except 2015 where 2020 was way lower.</p>
<p>FYI I worked the whole pandemic, didn’t social distance and didn’t wear a mask, I’ve still got a great job. We should all be dead by your logic.</p>

        <p>&rt; but masks do work, that's simply not up for debate.  </p>
<p>They way they're used they work as hazards to detriment physical performance. And it has nothing to do with a purpose of a mask to perform a task. In fact they are worse than smoking cigarettes.</p>

        <p>Everything concerning this virus is such a massive break from all protocol and sanity. What has happened after March 2020 has <em>never</em> been the rational, scientific consensus in how to deal with a respiratory virus. Why do you think there's never been a pandemic response like this one before? Why do you think that back at beginning of the year they weren't going insane? Why do you think they act like numerous studies (like the ones on masks not being significantly effective at reducing transmission of respiratory viruses, for example) published prior to 2020, don't exist anymore? Why do you think they act like they don't know the difference between CFR and IFR, and other obvious things about virology and epidemiology? Ever wonder why you woke up one day in March and nothing made sense anymore?</p>

        <p>Those people probably believed covid doesn't exist or if it does it isn't much a  threat to themselves and "society as a whole". They probably didn't hold any individualistic/libertarian political beliefs  as many scepticists do. The point is, even if there comes a virus with 100% death rate neither the state nor anybody else except from the business owner has the right to close someone's business, force businesses to enforce mask wearing and vaccine passes, control the way businesses operate in any way , or force people to take a mandatory vaccine or wear a mask in order to be able to walk in an public space/building. Every person is responsible for their own health and only that. If someone wants to wear a mask, that's ok. If someone wants to keep everyone at a distance that's ok too. I find both obnoxious but I I don't care in case that makes someone feel safe. I don't. I don't want to protect anyone and I don't want anyone to protect me. We hear the term "public health" all over the media, there is no such a thing. Health cannot be public. A person has their health, two people; each person has their own health and so on. There is nothing magical in between. Each individual is the only one responsible for their health and they can take whatever measures they may deem appropriate in order to protect it without requiring anyone else do anything.  What you won't find in the media, are the numerous people many of whom are here who either got covid or were scared at first and when the two weeks to flatten the curve became a year and measures kept getting stricter and more stupid, realised what a circus this whole issue is.</p>

        <p>Your analysis here is extremely flawed. Public spaces that are owned by govt can enforce whatever restrictions they want in that case, the way you describe rights. Mandatory immunization isn't happening here, the most you are having is employers saying to employees they must be vaccinated. Which even then is rare.</p>
<p>There is such a thing as public health, and public health emergencies etc. Humanity at no point in it's history has operated as "individuals" we have <em>always</em> maintained groups and helped one and other, including the more needy. A nation has a bunch of individuals who all could face health problems, those problems compounded in a society become a public health crisis, what would you have called the black plague if not a problem with public health, instead would it just be a bunch of individuals all being irresponsible by not maintaining their health? Extreme and inaccurate example, but really. You seem to think society doesn't exist, people are not at all responsible for anyone but themselves, and public anything shouldn't or doesn't exist. This is impossible. </p>
<p>I don't care about the political leanings of those people, I'm asking how their stories factor into your opinion. Or are they disregarding because you assumed that their politcal learning was as you described?</p>

        <p>There is no public health. Simple as that. There is no magical substance between the health of two individuals. Only an organism can have a health, not an abstract concept. I guess you are technically correct about public spaces, that's why there shouldn't have been any in the first place.</p>

        <p>It’s the doublespeak and doublethink that really bothers me. The “experts” flip flop so quick it’s ridiculous. When they’re called out on it, they deny it.</p>
<p>Also things like Fauci getting the vaccine in one arm and then going on TV for an interview an hour later and rubbing the opposite arm claiming it’s sore from the vaccine really makes you lose credibility in these “experts”.</p>
<p>A new one yesterday was that they kept saying the vaccine doesn’t affect transmission which means that if you get the vaccine you protect yourself but still have to mask up and distance because you can still carry it. That meant if I didn’t want to get the vaccine I wouldn’t be potentially affecting others. Now that many people have resisted to taking it, they’ve changed their tune and now say it does affect transmission (enough that everybody must take it or their an evil git, but not enough that we can stop wearing masks). </p>
<p>What about the hospitals? There are videos upon videos of empty hospitals, empty parking lots, etc. and then some nurses who claim they are overwhelmed and in a war zone have the audacity to choreograph dance routines for the internet. When I went to the ER during one of the “spikes” it was empty and when I asked the nurse she said it’s been this way for quite some time. I supposedly live in one of the hottest zones where the hospitals are supposedly full 24/7.</p>
<p>Also apparently (according to an interview I saw on BBC) if people who test positive for covid die within 60 days, the cause of death is marked as covid, so that right there overinflatates the numbers, not to mention the sharp drop in deaths from other diseases and ailments last year.</p>
<p>Why did Pfizer’s ceo say on an interview that he wouldn’t take the vaccine right away? </p>
<p>Why does bill gates get giddy every time he says the lockdowns and masking has to continue?</p>
<p>If the virus was so scary why is it that Gavin Newsom dines indoors, mask-less, with 10 other people who he doesn’t live with (except his wife)? I would expect someone who has access to better information than we have would be even more afraid of it. </p>
<p>What about Nancy Pelosi at the hair salon indoors, while everybody else had to be outdoors?</p>
<p>What about Diane Feinstein going mask-less at the airport (TWICE!) after telling you to wear one at the airport.</p>
<p>What about the BLM protests in the summer where many people were maskless or if they had a mask, much closer than 6 feet (including politicians who told you to wear a mask)</p>
<p>What about Cuomo walking his dog in NY without a mask?</p>
<p>What about when fauci was hanging with his buddies and got caught with his mask under his chin? He claimed it was because he was drinking water but there were multiple photos taken minutes apart where we wasn’t drinking water.</p>
<p>How come the mayor of Denver can say that you shouldn’t be traveling to see your family for thanksgiving 30 minutes before boarding a flight to see his family for thanksgiving. I mean come on, rules for thee not for me much?</p>
<p>Why is it safe for me to go to the stripclub but not church? </p>
<p>Why can we all go to Walmart and touch every surface together (before touching our masks) but the local mom and pop grocer has to stay closed? </p>
<p>And the list goes on and on and on and on. Eventually you start to question why these people with better access to information aren’t taking it as seriously as they’re telling us to. Then you do some digging and the whole narrative falls apart and here we are.</p>
<p>There’s no consistency to any of this and science is all about questioning and debating, yet both the New York Times and Columbia University tells me that I can’t question or debate their science. I have news for you, that’s a religion hiding behind science to give it legitimacy, not actual science.</p>
<p>Also if the government really cared about saving lives they would ban driving and force you to carpool with a “qualified expert in driving”</p>

        <p>So mostly it comes down to distrust in the govt. Which is one hundred percent valid. The government has done some dishonest and awful things, and constantly does what it can to improve things for the few at the detriment of the many. I mean, eventually no one would be compliant if it required wearing a mask forever, though we will probably see a bit of a shift in our culture now. Like flu season we will likely see more masks, more caution, especially with future novel disease we will most definitely see immediate caution. Unfortunately this narrative that has surrounded covid regarding the legitimacy of measures to curb it has created a good bunch of people who will do the exact opposite. It seems to be yet another wedge driven between members of the same class, who want generally the same things, and are oppressed all the same.</p>

        <p>Sorry I just added a bunch of stuff. But yes it’s 100% about distrust in government. If somebody tells me to follow something without question, it tends to make me want to question it, especially with all the mental gymnastics they’re having people do.</p>
<p>Also look how hard they are pushing he vaccine, it’s disgusting. Have you seen this video?</p>
<p>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wB9RSffVys4 </p>
<p>I agree, and believe covid is real, but not to the extent that they say. Again, if covid was as bad as they say, then why make up all this extra nonsense? All I see them doing is chipping away more and more freedoms, assuming more and more control, and telling us this is the new normal and to obey.</p>
<p>I disagree about your point that people would ditch the masks if this lasted forever. I think since they’ve slowly been ramping up the mandates people are getting used to it. It started with 2 weeks, then until the summer, then it was probably 2 years, then it was probably 10 years, now it’s potentially forever. 
Look how people use masks as a fashion statement these days. The majority of people have adjusted and I think the masks are here to stay.</p>
<p>BTW, thank you for the civil debate, it’s very refreshing.</p>

        <p>What's with the "anti-masker" term? Personally, I am not anti-mask, anti-vaccine or anti-anything else. I don't have a problem with masks. I have worn one for Halloween many times. I have worn one while doing light sanding work. I don't have a problem with anyone wearing masks, whenever they want to. I just don't fucking feel like wearing one. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I am respectful of peoples space. I don't sneeze and cough all over anyone. I don't yell at people who wear masks. I leave people alone. People wearing masks are making a choice and people who aren't wearing masks are making a choice. We all make choices every single day. Same thing goes with the vaccine. I got vaccinated when I was a kid. My kids are vaccinated. But, I am not fucking injecting myself with an experimental medication that was rushed to market in a matter of months. Every other vaccine in history took, at minimum, 7 years to bring to market. I have no faith that the covid vaccine is safe, long term. So, I will revisit it a few years from now, once I know what its long term effects are. I make choices that I feel are best for my family and me, based on my gut feeling and through analysis of available information. I do not make choices just because a bunch of unreasonably terrified people think I should make them. </p>
<p>You may think me not wearing a mask is selfish. That is perfectly fine with me. You are welcome to think what you want about me and anyone else not wearing a mask. I think people who wear masks, constantly, are being ridiculous. Given all the data, I feel they are unnecessary. It is my choice to think this and there is nothing anyone can do about it. I am not going to berate anyone wearing masks. I just laugh on the inside a little bit every time I see people with them on. I don't think they realize how ridiculous it looks, knowing that there is no need to be wearing them. </p>
<p>Just as I feel that people shouldn't bother people about not wearing masks, I feel those of us, who choose not to wear masks, should stop being so fucking sensitive. Who gives a shit if a small group of lonely control freaks thinks we are selfish or whatever else? We are not doing anything wrong. We are making a choice, just like choosing what clothes we put on this morning, which shoes we're wearing, whatever. And, that is okay. We are free to make choices and decisions. This is how life has always worked. Let these people say and feel whatever they want to. Who gives a shit? Engaging with this kind of bullshit is what gives these jackoffs meaning. Treat them the same as we used to treat people who gave us shit about a t-shirt or a pair of shoes we decided to wear one day. They are probably unhappy. They probably feel out of control in their personal lives and controlling others makes them feel better. Or, they are just annoying people. There are plenty of those. We need to let them feel how they want to and we will continue to make choices that make sense to us. Pretty simple.</p>

        <p>I'm sure for each vocal anti masker there are plenty more behind the scenes. I'm sure the same is true for people who have switched how they feel about covid in one direction or the other.</p>
<p>I get that the restrictions are tiring everyone out, and they seem to be almost pointless at times because "when will it end!?" And "no one can stop it", but instead of placing all of this blame for the pain from the clear problems our political/economic system that have been exacerbated by covid on restrictions, they should be placed where they belong.</p>

        <p>How long would you be willing to wear a mask? I think the debate mostly comes down to everyone having a threshold as to when they think the downside of wearing one outweighs the upside</p>
<p>On one end, people who won’t wear one at all (those who either don’t believe it does anything or hate wearing it or a combo of both) and those who might wear it for years to come. One thing I like to know from “pro-maskers” is where do they fall in the spectrum. Personally, I’ve worn one in close contact situations &amp; around older family members, but never outside, and I’m ready to ditch it entirely within a few months</p>

        <p>Yes, currently people are wearing it to prevent the spread of Covid, not knowing whether they are infectious at the moment or not.  That's a no brainer.</p>
<p>What I said is that in the future, we should normalize mask wearing in a manner similar to the Japanese, where it's standard to wear a mask in public if you're feeling under the weather to prevent the spread of colds and flus.  Again, a no brainer.</p>

        <p>Come back in a year and we’ll see who’s right. I have a feeling people are still gonna be wearing them well after Covid is gone, maybe for the flu, or if they were around someone who had the flu, or maybe they just like wearing them. This pandemic has brought on a level of neurosis and fear that we’ve never seen &amp; it goes way beyond what any science would recommend</p>

        <p>I got sick with covid, really sick, like in the hospital sick.  I’m still against lockdowns and mask mandates.  You know why?  Because I didn’t get sick because a failure of government or because my friends and community acted irresponsibly.  I got sick because covid is a seasonal respiratory virus that naturally spreads from host to host.  I am unwilling to lock myself away and accepted the risk of getting sick so I could continue to do the things I wanted to do.  I had a tough go of it, but I got better.  Life goes on as it does with the 99.8% of people under age 80 that get it.</p>

        <p>Why should I care that some "noteworthy" person changed their opinion in regards to this novel virus?</p>
<p>I don't wear masks because the virus is not deadly enough for me personally to warrant wearing one.</p>

        <p>I feel like if you were truly antimask (which I don't think is bad at all and think it's something any sane person would be) just getting the virus wouldn't change your opinion.</p>

        <p>I remember being really upset and changing my tune when I didn't get a flu shot in 2017 and came down with the worst flu of my life. I literally cried at the joint pain. And I had post viral fatigue for weeks. Even my boss asked me if my cough and fatigue was from the same illness I had weeks prior. I was so upset at myself for not getting the vaccine and I was on a rampage about WHO had gone out sick WITHOUT EVEN A MASK and had given me this awful disease. </p>
<p>I'm being EXTREMELY sarcastic, but that flu really did happen to me. I never saw a doctor because I only see doctors when it's an emergency or my work forces me to get a note. I still don't get the flu shot🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

        <p>I’m 22 years old, covid isn’t going to kill me. I’ve been going out massless even in lockdown and nothing has come from it. I know dozens of people who have been going out consistently to hang out with people and they are also fine. I’m not going to inconvenience my life because old people can’t just stay home.</p>

        <p>my mom is like this. she was effectively the embodiment of the views of the sub, then she got covid and still hasn’t fully recovered. now she’s getting on my ass about wearing n-95 masks and washing my hands after coming back from anywhere. i don’t get it. but i still believe what i believe.</p>
