    <strong>How do you guys feel about parties and events right now?</strong>
    <p><p>I guess weddings aren't technically illegal in my area, since my sister was able to book her October wedding at one of the most popular venues in town without any trouble–the place isn't even mandating masks. Part of me is a little worried about gathering all those people (roughly 60-70 for the ceremony itself and luncheon, and probably many more coming in and out for the reception), but another part of me feels like guests should be able to assess their own risk and make the decision of whether or not to attend for themselves. I also don't think it's fair that sis and her fiancé should have to indefinitely postpone their special day over a relatively benign virus that isn't likely to disappear anytime soon, even with a vaccine. </p>
<p>Idk, I'm just really conflicted about the whole thing. Ultimately it's their choice, and seeing as they're clearly moving forward with the wedding, I say good for them. But I do worry about what's going to happen if someone who's infected happens to attend and infects everybody at the wedding, like these stories you see in the news all the time where all it takes is one or two people to get the whole party sick. I'm kind of skeptical of those stories, actually, not because I don't believe they actually happen, but because I feel like there could be something more we aren't being told, such as people at the party behaving in such nasty and unsanitary ways that they brought upon themselves a huge infection rate.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm wondering how you guys feel about this. Would <em>you</em> be willing to attend a wedding right now? Sister isn't expecting that everyone she invites will show up, and they're encouraging vulnerable groups to stay home if they feel it's the right thing for them, but overall, she doesn't seem that concerned.</p></p>

        <p>I've been going to malls, arcades, restaurants, a museum, and several other "crowded" places. Booked tickets to go see a movie soon.</p>
<p>I'd go to a wedding, and enjoy myself. Life is too short to live in fear. I know this because I've been through a lot of horrific crap in my life, so I understand how precious life  and time are.</p>

        <p>A local theatre of ours that handles big, touring productions sent me a survey recently.</p>
<p>Survey:  What can we do to get you to come back to our theatre?</p>
<p>Me: Put on a show.  (and I also may have said masks would prevent me from attending)</p>
<p>I'd do anything open in society in a big group.  I'm done with fear.</p>

        <p>People are responsible for themselves. We can try to eliminate reasonable risks, and we do this frequently. Soap is available in restrooms to encourage people to remove contamination from body fluids from their hands, for example. But, by attending an event with others, you are agreeing to accept certain risks. Getting sick--with anything--is one of those risks. </p>
<p>We have all been sick before. We've all picked something up at an office or a school program or an airplane. We never whirled around to find and blame the person who unintentionally infected us. Any of these viruses we've had could have killed us, if the circumstances aligned in the most dangerous way. It is without malice that illness spreads. We can try to encourage survival, but we shouldn't let that goal destroy our ability to live.</p>
<p>People die of complications from illness all the time. My father-in-law died of pneumonia that was brought on by a mild virus. He had lung cancer, dementia and liver failure as well. We didn't wonder for even a second who infected him. We told people he died of his serious afflictions.</p>
<p>I don't know how many days I have left to live. None of us know what time we have. If I got covid and died tomorrow, that's my bad luck. I wouldn't insist that this means that people shouldn't have weddings or go to work. And I'd rather die having gotten to enjoy my time on this earth with the people I love, even if that time is just one day. That far outweighs any potential risks I've seen.</p>

        <p>Movie theaters, museums, etc are all closed in my area, but the moment they open up, I'm going to go. I go to various grocery stores every day to kill the time. I would welcome the opportunity to go to a wedding, as long as I wouldn't be required to wear a mask. I'm so tired of being under this soft house arrest.</p>

        <p>I would have no problem going to a wedding unless they had so many isolation rules that it wasn't any fun. If it was normal or the changes didn't really interfere with the event - spaced seating for the ceremony itself and extra cleaning of surfaces is a good idea - then great, I'm in.</p>

        <p>I would attend anything right now. People can decide their own risk and nothing is 0% since other viruses and bacteria still exist. Invitations don’t mean mandatory attendance, so people can stay home if uncomfortable. People who clearly have symptoms should also not attend.</p>

        <p>i would absolutely go to a wedding right now if i didn't have to fly (up to an eight hour drive would be fine).</p>
<p>(for the record, i hated flying before covid-19 because it's an expensive pain in the ass. and i think weddings are actually kind of a scam and we literally eloped without telling a soul. anyway, those are other rants.)</p>
<p>i think older guests and family members should use their best judgment and make the best decisions for them, but they should have a choice. i am uncomfortable making elderly and vulnerable people stay in isolation without their consent.  who wants to live out the rest of their lives like that?</p>
<p>if an infected person attends the wedding and other people get sick, it happens. it's like a cold or the flu, except yes, i know, this is covid-19 and we have no natural existing immunity, so it's quite dangerous for select groups of individuals. we don't stop wedding parties in the winter because someone might give Uncle Eddie a cough. now, maybe Uncle Eddie choses to not go to big parties in the winter because he doesn't want to get sick. maybe Uncle Eddie doesn't care if he gets sick. guests can make their own choices.</p>
<p>a lot of people over the age of 65 might not come and that might be a good decision for them until we have a vaccine or an effective treatment. i don't think a lot of people over the age of 65 want to see everyone else stop having a good time for an indefinite period of time just for their sake. they're just old, not complete assholes. perhaps people with immune system issues, or the morbidly obese or diabetic will stay away too and that does suck, but we can't help that. at some point, we have to ask people to protect themselves, but that doesn't mean punishing everyone else.</p>
<p>if young, healthy people (under the age of say 49) get infected by this virus, they are 99.74% likely to recover. even for people age 50+, it's not super serious until the age of 70; 70 seems to be the deadly threshold. most guests would experience mild cold/influenza-like symptoms, recover, and get on with it. many would be asymptomatic. most probably wouldn't even bother go getting tested at this point, they'd probably hear another guest got sick and they'd likely self-isolate for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>okay so all of the boring stuff is out of the way - of course i'd go to a wedding! i love to see people celebrate! i love to share that joy and happiness with everyone! we can't just stop living for 12-18 months because of this thing. it's an ABSURD proposition. people need to get married, people will have babies, there will still be birthdays, and unfortunately, yes, there will be funerals. life is about celebration, it's about delighting in the company of others. frankly, after five months of no joy whatsoever, i'm ready to let loose on the dance floor, drink too much at the open bar, eat too much at the buffet, flirt with the groomsmen, harass the DJ, shake my fat ass, dress up, look pretty, make a bad toast,  cry when i see the bride and groom for the first time, and barf on my husband. </p>
<p>I WANT TO PARTY!</p>

        <p>This is not an entirely new virus. Just a new strain of something we have all encountered before. Every one of us has had a coronavirus as a cold. Our immune systems know that germs mutate. They have developed defenses for that. We all have some immunity against it. The problem is people who aren’t healthy enough to mount a defense. Certain cascade of events create a cytokine storm.</p>

<p>We are five months into it. If someone can’t accept that there is a risk to everything in life and they need to make decisions to lower THEIR risk level, then that is their problem.

        <p>Yes. I would attend, and dance, laugh, and feel alive, and celebrate love and hope and my sister’s new journey in life. Remember when we used to celebrate being alive? And hell yes - every guest can assess their own risk. It’s called adulthood.</p>
