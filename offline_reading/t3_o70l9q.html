    <strong>Every day I miss how normal the world was before the pandemic</strong>
    <p><p>Every day I miss how normal the world was before the pandemic and I regret taking it all for granted.
In the lockdown I was reflecting on all the things I would have differently if I could turn back time before the pandemic happened . </p>
<p>If I could time  travel i would go back to 2019 and my future self would tell my past self: </p>
<p>". Enjoy this year and just have fun because the normal life you knew will soon be gone in a moment just like that. Under the rules of time travel I can't tell you what happens in the future. All I can say is enjoy all  the family outings to restaurants organised by your stepfather don't complain or be  angry at your mother for making you attend instead open up about being scared of having a new father figure in the family.Stop watching trashy reality TV and being jealous other celebrities lifestyles. Please stop worrying you failed to create the perfect life before 30. Don't envy the woman at church who has a husband and career at 23 or people in the forbes under 30 powerlist or people on Love Island or family members that are married and brag about their achievements. Stop being jealous of other peoples lives and love who you are. 
Please wear that red lipstick and have fun in the city don't spend time at home watching Netflix all day. Go to Winterwonderland this Christmas please don't cancel whatever happens. Visit that feminist bookstore you have always wanted to see.
Chrish single every moment with those love. Life can change like within a blink of an eye don't waste it ... </p>
<p>The pandemic and lockdown has changed everyone I know and I no longer recognise the people I care about. It feels like death except nobody has died. </p>
<p>Everyday I miss the times when my family and friends were boring people but at least they were normal. I could have a normal conservation with them about plans for the weekend and the holidays, the latest craziness in British politics and just normal things. My family and friends now are worried always covid19 all the time I can't have normal conservation   or do fun things with them without covid19 being mentioned. My next neighbour who is my friend is so scared of covid19. When the delivery man comes to deliver parcels to his house he wears a mask when answering the door. A couple of weeks ago he was doing this again i told him " this has got to stop" . He explained  to me it is about " safety" because germs get spread in the air  through people communicating up close. My mum continues say throughout the year" I don't want to hear anyone complain about lockdown or restrictions people have died."  </p>
<p>I have days in which I feel like none of this is real and it's just a dream . When I go outside and see all the physical changes around me in the town I live in it's a reminder this is real and  this new world now. </p>
<p>The final stage of grief is acceptance and just
like grief I have to accept the normal life I knew and relationships I had with the people I cared about is not  coming back. </p>
<p>If you could turn back time before the pandemic happened what would have done differently?</p></p>

        <p>I really wish I could go back and tell myself not to worry about the money so much and just travel. I always wanted to visit Italy because that’s where my parents are from. Now I feel like I will be landlocked in the US forever because I will not get the vaccine. Life isn’t so bad here, thankfully it’s getting more normal, but definitely not the same. We are not as free.</p>

        <p>Stormborn28 Italy is a very beautiful country I went a year before the pandemic( 2019). I visited Rome during the Easter holidays with my family. I went to St Peter basilica and St Peters Square, the colosium, and  the village of Assi. I really loved my time there. The people are very lovely there was this one Italian man who had a family restaurant my family went in to. He was really lovely and made a joke " you can come and stay here with my family in Italy and I can come to stay with your family in England " we all just laughing. I have so many wonderful stories from my time in Italy.</p>
<p>I really hope you get to vist one day :)</p>

        <p>I would have lived my life completely unbothered and I would've Kurt Cobain-ed or Jim Morrison-ed myself around November-December 2019 before I even get to hear the word 'coronavirus' on the news for the first time.</p>
<p>Dunno if I wish I would have done something differently. It feels like my life was cut short. I would've traveled a bit more I guess but that's it. No point in aiming towards a successful career, starting a family and all that when you're young and you know that it's all gonna be taken away from you very soon.</p>
<p>I wish I was born a couple of decades earlier. All I wish is to have lived for a bit longer. I'd swap places with a dying octogenarian, that's how much I hate the current situation. These people got to experience a completely different world, which, too, had some petty rules and was bad in its own way but still much more hopeful and colorful than the world I'm doomed to live in. It's so unfair :(</p>

        <p>Manger-Alarming big Virtual hug for you </p>
<p>I turned 24 last month and being in lockdown I feel like my life  and potential as human is being wasted. I feel like my life is over and never even got to live it. I can't even share my feelings with my family because  there have  been a series of covid19 deaths and currently sick relatives in the family from covid19. My family believe people who complain about lockdown are selfish and being ridiculous because "people  have died" </p>
<p>&rt;I wish I was born a couple of decades earlier.
Same here I feel like I was born in the wrong time line. I wish in the grew up  in the hippie era. </p>
<p>The things I love about the hippe era is the free love culture,  the vw campervan hippies used to travel, believing in peace, ,  liberal use of drugs and non conformist culture of the hippies. I loved how in the 1960s people were protesting against social injustices because it was the right thing to do today people are only protesting because its cool to do ie the amount of instragram photos people take of themselves at protests it's so nauseating, the virtual signalling on social media,  the celebrities jumping from one protest to another. </p>
<p>The worst thing about being lockdown for me is NOT having a real meaningful purpose during lockdown.  Every one lockdown was longing for human contact and socialisation but throughout the national lockdowns I was longing for a meaningful purpose , it upset me everyday I was not doing anything meaningful with my life . The absence of a purpose was killing me and is still killing me .</p>

        <p>Even though I'm a bit older I feel the same. I shouldn't have to spend these years locked, depressed, worried, isolated and in constant fear for the future. The people we're sacrificing ourselves for didn't have their youth ruined. They had 3 babies and a home when they were my age. And what do we get? Nothing. We only get things taken away from us. Our ability to travel, make a living, connect with people, have purchasing power large enough to not have to live in small dingy flats for the rest of our lives. Gone. It's all gone. Soon probably money will be gone too, or only given in exchange for our compliance....</p>
<p>I'm lucky because my family is on the same page but I still feel very lonely in my views. If it wasn't for a few subreddits, I would have felt even more isolated. There isn't much left to live for, really. I never thought life could feel so empty and I could be so powerless to change it. Because I literally have no control over it.</p>
<p>The 60s and the 70s are my favourite decades too. Sometimes for a moment I like to try forget that I live in a world with cameras on every corner, QR codes for access to pubs, mandatory face coverings and hotel quarantines. I really think we've reached the lowest point as humans, yet it feels like this tyranny is just the beginning. How I wish there was an alternate reality or at least a way to go back and appreciate life more, seeing it with different eyes...</p>
<p>A virtual hug for you too and remember that if you're against this madness, you're my friend even though we've never met.</p>

        <p>Rumdiddleydumdum The public are behaving like the population in Black Mirror when it comes to the vaccine passport debate. I have noticed in  Black Mirror in every episode the  majority of the population  embrace the new technology in the dystopian world they are living without serious opposition. </p>
<p>My family and people around me think vaccine passports are OK and see no problem. My mum and grandmother told me when they moved to the UK they had to prove they were vaccinated agaisnt yellow fever to be allowed entry in to the country. My family think vaccine passports are just similar to the yellow fever certificates they had to carry. Yellow fever certificates were international travel only whereas the vaccine passport will be used for aspects of domestic life </p>
<p>The problem with  vaccine passports is that is opens the door for the state to expand  interference in people's lives and private busines . If the state can introduce vaccine passports then what next are is the state  going to introduce?
A licence to have a certain number of children to stop climate change?
A meat licence of how much meat we can eat ?</p>
<p>Black Mirror was not for our  entertainment but a warning of what our world potentially can become  if certain  technology inventions  get created and allowed in to society without any serious opposition.</p>
<p>This is such a slippery slope it is very worrying people can't see this at all.</p>

        <p>In the UK Hancock openly said only a few days ago that all Health Data is being digitised with paperwork being scrapped which nobody noticed. So there is no doubt that this is heading in that direction. If Covid had not existed it would have been dealt with in a sensible and democratic way but now it’s just going to be a way to control everyone because the British people have just sat back and done nothing every time they move the goalposts. It’s a free for all now for them to do as they please and they will push every agenda they can. </p>
<p>Black Mirror was more accurate than some might think, things like social scoring etc will eventually happen.</p>

        <p>The world before the pandemic had it problems but it was sooooo much better than the present we are all living in. </p>
<p>I didn't have to worry about leaving the house without a mask all I had to worry about was whether I had my keys and oyster card in my bag. I could have a normal conservation with my family and friends but now everyone is worried about covid19 all the time I can't have normal conservation about anything anymore . I could go in to whatever shop or venue I wanted without worrying that I had a mask on or scan in using the NHS track and trace app or be worried about the paranoid people in public. </p>

        <p>Normal is pretty subjective. I could argue that we haven't seen “normal” since 2015.  It's like I woke up one day and I'm now living in a parallel universe (Bizzaro world) and everything has been ass-backward ever since.</p>

        <p>I asked a similar question last year. I too wish I didn’t worry about the small shit.  Would’ve worried less about money and put it to more life experiences. </p>
<p>When the scamdemic started, I was 24. Today I’m turning 26 and I feel like I’m wasting my life through no fault of my own. I don’t cry about it anymore. I just feel nothing. The people I thought were cool became soft, hysterical, and boring when I needed them most. I hate when doomers gaslight me considering that they were able to live their younger years unscathed. </p>
<p>I’m never getting the vaccine so I feel heartbroken about possibly not being able to travel again. I’m going to all the festivals I can this year that don’t require the bullshit theatrics because I know this is far from over. </p>
<p>“Pretty much normal” is not good enough.</p>
