        <p>My opinion: I’m not anti vax, I’ve had all required vaccines so far (flu and others when I was young) I just decline this one as it hasn’t had the long term testing which I think 1 out of 4? Is only FDA approved like the ones I have had, had, I’m against lockdowns because I feel it’s against human rights, nobody can tell me where I can and can’t go, at any time (excl restriction zones and no trespassing areas) and I’m not for masks because I have a video of Fauci, and other epidemiologists (I assume) saying that masks are ineffective, I would use n95 if the situation needed me to, as before the pandemic, surgical masks were just that.. surgical masks, to stop anything from the person being operated on potentially being consumed.</p>

        <p>Not be tinfoil hat, but remember 2 weeks to flatten the curve?</p>
<p>Vaccine passports were definitely not a thing; do you remember that?</p>
<p>Covid testing was ramped past any reasonable threshold, and went from a death pandemic to a case pandemic?</p>
<p>Mass censorship, this rings alarm bells big time, you know “the ministry of truth”.</p>
<p>All governments singing from the same script? What the fuck?</p>

        <p>So to answer that bit by bit, I agree there is and would always be controversy around vaccines, however history does support that vaccines would mostly be safe (however I understand that point more than others). Next lockdowns being against human rights, I see this argument to be flawed as by that logic human rights are violated everyday. The very basis of capitalism in many ways violates human rights as by restricting and exploiting others for the gain of the richer. Freedom and human rights require for everyone to have a consensus of better human life, and by those means, everyone abiding by proven tactics to reduce the spread of a virus. The joint effort of all parties to reduce it is for the continuance of a persons human rights (at least in a country where you aren’t oppressed by other countries) thirdly, masks not being effective. This is a topic that can be debated back and fourth, however from many in-depth research and studies, it shows that it is better to wear a mask compared to not wearing one. I myself have seen the effects of masks as I’ve had people very close to me wearing one when they’ve had covid and not spreading it to me. If the problem isn’t masks being effective or not, but the human right violations that you said earlier, than I say the same argument of how the collective action to combat a virus that has negative consequences for everyone can protect your human rights and not cripple the world by immense death. Saying this, I agree the UK has done a piss poor job dealing the virus but that doesn’t disregard or absent the idea of collective action</p>

        <p>&rt;starts to talk about capitalism</p>
<p>Ok, so why exactly do you trust Big Pharma. Especially Pfizer, who did previously kill children in Nigeria with an experimental vaccine (just google "nigeria pfizer")?</p>
<p>You are totally fine with taking an experimental vaccine from those capitalist Big Pharma corporations? And you are aware that those corporations are not liable and you can not sue them if they harm you?</p>
<p>And yes, it is experimental, if it wouldn't be experimental, it wouldn't need an emergency admission, it would get a regular one.</p>

        <p>First of all, 60% of people follow the dominant narrative. That's in any country, no matter the dominant narrative. 60% will follow anyone from Ghandi to Hitler, as long as they are considered 'good citizens' for doing it. 60% of people always drift in the mainstream.</p>
<p>All the ideological fights happen among the remaning 40%. The dominant narrative is set by a very small group, less than 10%. There are also dissidents, who are &lt;10%, and who are very diverse. As you said, they can be anything from antimaskers to antivaxers to flatearthers. However, the next dominant narrative will be born in the dissident circles. Think about: there was a time when supporting Hitler was considered very fringe, there was a time when supporting Hitler was considered mainstream, and nowadays supporting Hitler is plain illegal. The same generation of germans has seen all three phases in their lifetime. Dominant narratives change, so at some point somebody has to come up with a new one, and that's rarely done by people who are in power. Why would people in power ever change the dominant narrative. </p>
<p>So i'd say there is 10% of alphas, who set the dominant narrative, there are 10% of dissidents who are always against everything (and who are nursing the next dominiant narrative), and there are about 20% of people who can 'change their mind'.</p>
<p>If you don't set the mainstream narrative, if you are not in 10% of alpha elite, there's literally no reason to support the mainstream narrative. There will always be 60% of sheeple who will. You gotta be searching for the next big thing.</p>
