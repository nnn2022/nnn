    <strong>Anyone get banned from a sub for spreading "misinformation" that is now true?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been banned for multiple subs for saying stuff like "the vaccines don't prevent transmission". We now know that this is 100% true.</p>
<p>Are you going to try to get unbanned from a sub you previously enjoyed? </p>
<p>For me, I'm basically done with Reddit. This sub is the only reason I'm still here. When/if this is gone, I'm out.</p></p>

        <p>Playing devils advocate here, but CNN is the one claiming the vaccines don't prevent transmission. I've never taken anything they say seriously, so I'd be a hypocrite if I started trusting them now.</p>
<p>On a side note, it's probably just a bunch of propaganda to justify a new round of lockdowns and revised mask mandates.</p>

        <p>Yes, I got banned for that particular piece of “misinformation” a couple days ago. I won’t bother trying to get unbanned bc I know when mods are apt to powertrip (almost always) and they’ll refuse to acknowledge they were wrong. It’s also a subreddit that attracts trashy women (it keeps popping up on my feed because it’s makeup related though). </p>
<p>Also people have all but lost their damn minds! If you say anything questioning the vaccine mandates, people will immediately be extremely rude and hostile towards you, no matter how civilly you speak. This is the mentality they’ve been primed with though with all the “unvaxxed = scum” propaganda. </p>
<p>Of course, if you meet their tone and tell them off, they cry and report you lol. These people are literal weak-minded bullies who talk smack but ultimately back down as soon as someone stands up to their entitled nonsense. Like all fascists, they need to be nipped at the bud by ordinary citizens so they’re not allowed to grow into a another Holocaust.</p>

        <p>Breakthrough cases are equally infectious </p>
<p>This does not mean the vaccine does not prevent spread </p>
<p>It means someone with an active infection is equally as likely to spread the virus </p>
<p>But the vaccine does decrease of chances you contracting the virus, by most metrics an unvaccinated person is 8x more likely to become infected compared to someone who is vaccinated.  </p>
<p>What we do not know is asymptomatic spread, it might not even be something to worry about for unvaccinated people, it also might be an issue for those who are vaccinated </p>
<p>Unfortunately we do not have mass data on titers, this is a very vital piece of information we are missing and for anyone to make large scale claims on the vaccines ability to slow transmission without this data is making a claim that is not know </p>
<p>We have plenty of nations with very high vaccine rates at this point, I suspect come winter when another wave is here we will see stark differences in case load between highly vaccinated areas and areas with low vaccination rates </p>
<p>What you said is not misinformation, but It is a misinterpretation of the data</p>

        <p>Any mask that’s not an N95 is not gonna be efficacious enough for aerosolized spread </p>
<p>I think if everyone wore 95 or a very large portion this would drastically snuff out the virus </p>
<p>As for cloth or surgical masks these only halt droplet spread if you aren’t coughing or sneezing these will have a minimal effect at best </p>
<p>This is not new Information, I understand the media may be saying otherwise, but this is common knowledge when it comes preventing contagions and proper PPE </p>
<p>What is still up for debate is asymptomatic spread </p>
<p>If you are colonized but not actively sneezing or coughing what is the risk of aerosolization? I do not have the answer for this </p>
<p>Likely this answer will have to be stratified based on viral but that’s just my hunch and not based in data at the moment </p>
<p>It saddens me this pandemic has left the realm of science and is now political </p>
<p>We are more tribal then ever and most people on either side of this debate are blind in their opinion</p>
<p>Most people’s decisions on whether to get vaccinated or not get vaccinated are not based on science but based on political ideaolgy and dogma</p>

        <p>Everyone or even a very large majority wearing N95 is an impossible utopia. You need training to wear it and even more training to take care of it properly. </p>
<p>Now we are going to have more unanswered questions. For example, can vaccinated be colonized and maintain a stable viral load for a long time?</p>

        <p>You don’t need training on how to wear or it maintain it </p>
<p>Sizing matters, facial hair matters, but the idea that either out 100% proper usage by everyone it won’t be effective is a fallacy </p>
<p>And I also don’t think it’s a utopia to think we as a people could come together for the greater good </p>
<p>Unfortunately when we have a common enemy the virus and we still cannot come together it does make me wonder if we are capable for the greater good, if we continually choose to make each other the enemy even when their is a clear problem we all could help solve to benefit all of us </p>
<p>As for vaccinated people being able to harbor a large enough viral load to make them able to spread </p>
<p>We do not know, and no one within the scientific community is making these claims </p>
<p>I understand media figures may be saying this but this is not what the science says </p>
<p>But the science also doesn’t shows it doesn’t stop spread either </p>
<p>If vaccines only decrease symptoms and deaths but not spread then by all means this vaccine is one that should be used in the high risk populations </p>
<p>But at the moment the data does lean heavy toward it decreasing spread </p>
<p>Scatter plot the nations based on cases and vaccine rates and you will see a trend,  not exact science but a trend </p>
<p>Ultimately this delta variant will likely infect anyone left who’s not vaccinated or hasn’t already had the virus </p>
<p>What I fear is some of these enclaves of unvaccinated people will allow the virus to simmer around and more variants will come</p>
<p>I live in one of these areas and work in inpatient medicine and treat these people</p>
<p>By no means is my anecdotal evidence something you should take as fact, but for me it is fact and for me in several counties across several hospitals this is very much a virus primarily effecting the unvaccinated at this point</p>
