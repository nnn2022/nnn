    <strong>ITALY: the answer of the police of Rome, in regards to lockdown protests</strong>
    <p><p>Protests in front of Montecitorio (the parliament), Police: 'Their desperation is understandable and impossible to hold, and we are paying the consequences. We have to give the citizens a different kind of answers'.</p>
<p>We give our solidariety and well wishes of healing to our colleagues hurt during the protests in front of Montecitorio (the parliament), and all the other forces in a service much more heavy and oppressive than we can ever think. What has happened does not have to surprise us, neither can we press the citizens under the weight of unsustainable sacrifices.  It is inevitable that the series of protests and manifestations of every kind, from the sides of every possible social categories, now arrived at an exhaustive state. It is indispensable censoring without questions every kind of violence that, long from affirming the legitimate demands of those who are protesting in the streets, hides and diminishes, also makes them look like they are on the wrong side, everyone who has something to say about it. With further intellectual honesty we have to highlight that this generalised exhaustion is understandable and we have to give our citizens a different kind of answers. Right now, like always, the police forces have to pick up the pieces and deal with this level of exhaustion of the citizens, which  cannot and must not be be undermined and undervalued. We have to think in the guise of handling this not-anymore-emergency situation, going on since more than a year, from the perspective of the reality of whom, cannot keep their existence afloat, existence which has been built after many years of work and dedication. Undermining this means undermining serious and real dangers for the internal security of this country.</p>
<p>- Valter Mazzetti, General Secretary of the Federation State Police, commenting the news of hurt policemen during the lockdown protests in front of Montecitorio (Italian Parliament)</p>

        <p>They are saying that it's completely understandable that people are fed up with this. It's more than the police in Belgium would say, I guess...</p>

        <p>yes it is saying that these protests are completely understandable and not listening to the protesters demands and needs is wrong. and also criticizing the media that wants to make these protesters look like they're on the wrong side of history.</p>
<p>These words coming from a super cop, i think this is a really great thing to witness. Sorry i've done by best to translate it properly.</p>
