        <p>My thoughts exactly. Apparently I need some fucking health nazi’s “permission” to go outside or see my own parents. At this point I don’t care if they give me a ticket or not. I do as I please and if they have a problem they can suck it.</p>

        <p>Many friends/family members I talk to in Ontario tell me they are frustrated and say “but <em>people</em> won’t do anything about it”.  They don’t understand that <em>they</em> are people.  I feel that being passive and polite is so deeply woven into the ethos that it’s the only way the know how to do things.</p>

        <p>Lmao. I went to a liquor store to get some wine last week, an Indian guy owns the place and had his diaper on his chin. When I went inside he put it over his face. I told him you don't need to put it on for me I work at a hospital it's all overblown bs and we got into a conversation where I told him a lot of facts i knew and he mentioned his family are naturopaths and we chatted for a couple minutes.</p>
<p>As he was ringing me up i noticed some girl walked in with two mouth diapers on and just to be a dick I said yeah most Americans are absolute retards and think this whole thing is still real. I looked right at her and she looked away. I was hoping for a reaction of some sort but I didn't get one lol. I'm hoping to move to Florida sometime this year. Can't take living in a blue state anymore.</p>

        <p>Lol, I got a free lunch and my annual review was role model employee for working the covid floors. I'm IT so not patient facing but I was on the units a lot and I work with the providers constantly. </p>
<p>I enjoy my job but they're starting to give more rights to the vaccine recipients and I know my time there is limited. I will not wear a mask forever nor take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Problem is I'll need to retrain for a different field entirely to make the money I was making if I leave. I have a lot to think about and not much time to think about it!</p>
<p>Hey at least Canada has Chris Sky explaining your rights to everyone, the US doesn't have a Chris Sky doing that so it's hard to know what's law and what's a guideline.</p>
<p>I visited family in Florida back in December, no masks was amazing. I still can't believe this is all happening even after a year. I'd prefer not to uproot my life, but it's looking like I'll have to more and more.</p>

        <p>I’m with you there, I’m not getting the vaccine and I already am over wearing a mask. I work in direct patient care and it is exhausting trying to do what I do with that stupid thing on my face 24/7. </p>
<p>It’s unfortunate that you may be forced to make those types of decisions because of all this hysteria. I enjoyed my place of work for the most part before all of this but now I’ve had to question my career choice entirely as well because I just can’t go on the way things are headed. It’s all really, really disappointing. </p>
<p>Thank god for him but as you can imagine, majority of Canadians think he is a crazy conspiracy theorist. I really hate how the people making the most sense are always branded as insane. Even though I agree with him, if I were to think of posting something of his on my social media I would get that twinge in my mind like “oh well you know everyone’s gonna think you’re nuts!” It’s even programmed into me when I don’t even agree with it! </p>
<p>I think there’s probably more people in the states discussing how unconstitutional everything is than you may realize. It sounds stupid but tiktok has a lot of good content once your feed is tailored to exclude the NPCs</p>

Last time I went grocery shopping my mask slipped under my nose for a few seconds while I was at the check out and the hostility that ensued was so over the top that even the people on this sub might think I exaggerated.</p>

        <p>If I were somewhere where the lockdowns were super drastic, I'd setup a protest weekend a month in advance and start posting it everywhere. The only way to beat this is strength in numbers.</p>
<p>The thing that makes all the other Protests fail is that they are only 1 day and then everyone goes back to masks. If you make it a weekend and the crowds are large enough, there's not much they can do and it gets people used to the idea.</p>

        <p>Nobody in my town seems very interested in protesting. The thing is, in this small town, the police and the council have been pretty easy on rule-breakers, in most cases. We just go about our business like usual if we're not scared. For instance, even though hockey was banned on the outdoor rinks during the last stay-at-home order, people were playing hockey. Even a guy who I think was supposed to be a rink monitor was playing hockey.</p>
