    <strong>CoViD-19 Propaganda</strong>
    <p><p>Looking back on old propaganda can be hilarious. Imagine when they said that CoViD-19 was so deadly that people in Wuhan were dropping dead on the street thanks to it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/infected-people-seen-dead-streets-21347952">https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/infected-people-seen-dead-streets-21347952</a></p>
<p>Later on they had to dial down the deadliness as CoViD-19 had spread across the world yet hardly anyone died to it; although they could still get away with highly overblowing the deadliness of CoViD-19 by using research methods such as paying hospitals to report higher CoViD-19 cases. Still, the damage was already done. The initial propaganda had put great fear in every ignorant couch potato (i.e. most of modern humanity) and had allowed the corrupt governments of the world to start the CoViD-19 Orwellian measures. When people finally realised that the deadliness of CoViD-19 was way overblown, we were already months in the lockdown and getting used to it.</p>
<p>Maybe this life as slave is not that bad, though. And besides that, the same news sources that misleadingly implied that we would all drop dead like flies when CoViD-19 comes and that helped the governments start this deadly and harmful regime under false pretenses, says that we still need lockdowns and keeps repeating supposed cases of people getting terribly ill due to CoViD-19, so surely we must still need the measures. The mainstream media which lied to us about the deadliness of CoViD-19 in order to further their corrupt agenda would never lie to us about the deadliness of CoViD-19 in order to further their corrupt agenda.</p>
<p>I wish you all a happy 2 weeks to flatten the curve and that we all may hold on just until the injections come.</p></p>
