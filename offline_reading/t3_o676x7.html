    <strong>Are you still going on about Covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Massachusetts, the most left-wing state in Tony Fauci's communist hell nation, and I haven't worn a mask in like a month. I eat out at restaurants regularly, and a week ago I went to a birthday party with 20 other people at a Dave and Busters where me and all my liberal friends crammed around the table and shared food and then played DDR in the arcade for like five minutes before remembering we're old. I don't even have a mask in my possession anymore unless I'm taking an Uber somewhere (the one place that still has masks). If someone asked me to mask up I wouldn't be able to, and I'm a non-confrontational sheeple lib.</p>
<p>And, yes, most people up here are vaccinated, myself included, but I have never been asked to show a card. Most people don't even have their cards anymore, I suspect, so we couldn't set up vaccine passports if we wanted to. And we're a liberal state!</p>
<p>If us libs are back to the old normal because enough people are vaccinated up here that we have herd immunity and no longer care that much if other people are vaxxed, and conservative states are back to the old normal because Covid only kills old people and they don't count, then what's the "new normal" you're fighting so stringently against? I read this sub and it's like I'm talking to the last Japanese Soldier in the Philippines except in this metaphor the Japanese won. The pandemic's over. It's been over for <em>weeks</em>. Go out and live your lives!</p></p>

        <p>When your vaccine-induced antibodies start to wane, you HAVE to return to top-off with another dose. If you don't, what little antibodies you have actually promote cellular uptake of Covid. It's called ADE. I wasn't kidding, you're on the ride and there is no getting off now.</p>

        <p>I wouldn’t want to be you, your vaccine antibodies slowly decreasing over time, but always in need of another booster to keep concentrations high like a dope fiend. You can’t let these vaccine induced antibodies get too low in concentration or they become non neutralizing and they backfire on you. Too bad you don’t have a broad based innate immune response to covid, you sold your immune system down the river for a temporary fix.</p>

        <p>If you want a conspiracy theory: The lockdown was a way to separate Americans into those who trust the system and those who reject it. The vaccine was also a vaccine against Covid-21, which will be dramatically more contagious and dangerous, and cleanse a lot of Trump types from America while generating a lot of "<a href="https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1398433834006368257">This guy refused to get his vaccine. Now he's dead</a>!" type headlines. That serves the Powers The Be a lot more than separating Americans into those that trust them and those don't don't and killing off the <em>former</em> group.</p>

        <p>Rebuild society? You're thinking too Hollywood.</p>
<p>From March 1 2020 to March 1 2021, there were 500,000 and change Covid deaths. Now we have a more virulent Delta strain but also large chunks of the country are vaccinated. Lets assume these two changes cancel out. 500,000 deaths a year. 0.15% of the United States population. Tragic, but that's hardly going to collapse society. It's going to be one of those background horrors the media eventually gets bored of (especially since the media is based in big liberal cities where everyone is vaccinated).  300,000 people got murdered in 2020, and you might have heard about it but it's not collapsing society, even in the cities where the murder spike is concentrated.  </p>
<p>But if those 500,000 skew heavily towards somewhat old right-wingers....0.15% of the US population a year. Times three years is 0.45% of the population by 2024. That's more than the margin Biden won Georgia and Arizona by. A long-running covid background noise small enough to be ignored and forgotten can still be large enough to turn North Carolina blue.</p>

        <p>We may be doing better in the states, but restrictions are far from over in Canada, Australia and other countries. </p>
<p>Besides, though, I wouldn’t exactly call what we have going on “back to the old normal”. Employers are starting to ask for the vaccination statuses of their employees (my company included) and in some cases, mandating vaccination as a condition of employment. </p>

<p>You said it. Nobody here did. Liberal states had some of the harshest policies and also the worst results, but our contention that it didn't matter. All they did was create more problems, while not saving anybody.</p>

        <p>Good. NC has been normal for 2 months; FL has been for over a year.</p>
<p>However, eternal vigilance in defending freedom is necessary. Now that governments know that they can just declare 'emergency' like Michael Scott declaring bankruptcy and a critical mass will just blindly believe them, they are always a threat. </p>
<p>Also, calling Mass a 'liberal' state fundamentally misunderstands liberalism. Liberalism champions individual liberty, which is why those two words have the same root word. Locking people in their homes indefinitely with no due process is diametrically opposed to that idea.</p>
