        <p>She had pain in the injection site Tuesday night and then during Tuesday  she got worse with nausea and some fever.  By Wednesday she was  complaining that she could not pee even though she was drinking a lot of  fluids.  She continued to complain it was the worst she ever felt and  then at 0600 Thursday morning she woke us up and said she needed to go  to the hospital.  We arrived at the hospital just before 0700 and she  immediately threw up in the trash can.  We went into a treatment room  and they took blood and started fluids as she became incoherent.  She  said she had taken Tylenol so they started a drug to counter that but  her liver function was all wrong and they started to look for a hospital  that could transplant a liver.  She was air evade about 0930 to Medical  center and just over 30 hours latter she was dead.  There is a pending  autopsy.  She was a healthy 39 year old mother who got the shots because  she worked as a surgical tech and she was the single mother of a 9 year  old little girl.</p>

        <p>After being observed for approximately 20 minutes and patient walked to  her car without assistance I was called to assess the patient in the  parking lot for troubles breathing.  EMS was called as I made my way  outside.  Upon my arrival patient was leaning out of the car and stating  that she could not breath.  She was able to tell me that she was  allergic to penicillin.  Oxygen was immediately placed on the patient  with minimal relief.  Lung sounds were coarse throughout.  She then   began to vomit about every 20-30 seconds.  Epipen was administered in  the right leg with no relief.  Patient continued to complain of troubles  breathing and vomiting.  A second epipen was administered in the  patients right arm again with no relief.  A few minutes later patient  was given racemic epinephrine through the oxygen mask.  There appeared  to be mild improvement in her breathing as she appeared more  comfortable, but still complaining of shortness of breath and vomiting.   When EMS arrived patient was unable to transport herself to the  stretcher.  When EMS and clinical staff transferred patient to the  stretcher she became unresponsive.  She appeared to still be breathing.   She did not respond to verbal stimuli.  Per ED report large amount of  fluid was suctioned from the patients lungs following intubation in the  ambulance.  When patient arrived to the ED she was extubated and  re-intubated without difficulty and further fluid was suctioned.  At  that time patient was found to be in PEA, shock was delivered.  Shortly  thereafter no cardiac activity was found and patient pronounced dead.</p>

Received second shot and of Feb.  1 week later,  at 12 weeks pregnancy ,   fetus had no heart beat!  It measured normal size (as expected) and  limited normal first trimester anatomy by ultrasound. But NO heart beat.  Something insulted this placenta to lead to fetal demise.</p>

        <p>On December 17, 2020, my husband, received his first BioNTech BNT162b2  COVID-19 vaccination. On Thursday January 7, 2021, he received this  second COVID-19 vaccination. The following three days after his second  vaccination, he felt fine. The fourth day, on Sunday January 10, my  husband felt extremely fatigued. On Monday the 11th and Tuesday the  12th, he worked a full shift but complained of extreme fatigue and  extreme chills to the point that his teeth were chattering while on the  phone with me. He decided to work through it. When he got home on Monday  night, he started vomiting. On Wednesday January 13, he woke up and had  swollen eyes. Once again, he felt extremely fatigued, even after a full  nights rest. He had the day off but had an early meeting. After his  meeting, he was still tired so he went back to sleep. I left to get  lunch, and drop off our kids, and upon my return, I found him on the  walk in closet floor, face up, having passed away. He felt as cold as  ice. The rapid test done after they called the paramedics resulted in a  negative COVID-19 test for him.</p>
