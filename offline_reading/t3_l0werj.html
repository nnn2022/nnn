    <strong>These whole lockdowns were based on the idea that you could asymptomatically transmit the virus. Now that it‚Äôs known the vaccine will only stop you from getting symptoms they‚Äôre acting like Asymptomatic spread isn‚Äôt a thing</strong>
    <p><p>So the whole argument I‚Äôve gotten in favor of the authoritarian idea of forcing a vaccine on everyone is that it will limit your symptoms to the point of being asymptomatic which means it will be hard to spread. And for this to work everyone has to take it </p>
<p>But for the past 10 months we‚Äôve destroyed the whole economy along with our children‚Äôs futures because everything had to shut down due to the idea that you could potentially asymptomatically spread it. We have been told to be on indefinite house arrest because we have to assume we might have a virus. Going to see your family is the equivalent of murder right? But now all a sudden asymptomatic spread is acceptable?</p></p>

        <p>Hardly anything about this whole thing makes even an iota of sense. I think there's some other point of this vaccine, maybe sterilization, but I don't know what it is yet. :/</p>

No I don't believe q shit (didn't this start with Epstein?)
And no, Trump (rhetoric) did not make me hate the CCP.

        <p>I didn't know about that... that's awful. Most of what I know about the CCP, to be honest, comes from novels like Do Not Say We Have Nothing by Madeline Thien, but that includes the Tiananman Square incident.</p>

<p>This is a tiny blip on the radar.</p>
<p>I apologize for my political content but Clinton in the 90s convinced us that by opening trade with the CCP, that it would bring democracy and freedom to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>It's very clear that it only helped bring communism to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It's a sad day but never forget to award these users with a beautiful and shiny r/goldensheeple award, it's loads of fun imo.</p>

        <p>And the beauty of the whole plan is, they'll reduce it just enough so that it's not noticeable enough to panic. The news obviously wont cover it, or blame declining fertility on things like our diet, or the pollution in the air. Meanwhile billions of people down the line will have their dreams of having a child crushed without ever having a choice in the matter. They took the jab, to get back to normal.</p>

        <p>We already know Bill Gates aims at population control. We also already know both men and women have been warned to freeze their eggs and sperm prior to receiving the vaccine if they think they may want kids. We also know that he was involved in planning a pandemic simulation. If you don‚Äôt know, all of this is easy to find on the internet.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I've heard all of this. :/ I'm glad that Canada didn't get any more doses of the Moderna vaccine. The other ones probably will have issues, too, but I'm most suspicious of anything that Gates has his hands in.</p>

        <p>The freezing of eggs seems to be more of a speculation thing than the sperm freezing is. But before the sperm freezing came to surface I read a few articles on fertility worries. And it might be smart to freeze some eggs ‚Äújust in case‚Äù none of vaccines have been tested on the basis of will it make women infertile, and I wouldn‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs been tested for men either. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if more than half of the people that get the vaccine are suddenly unable to have children and they try and say it has nothing to do with it.</p>

        <p>Virologists have confirmed that asymptomatic spread was never the main factor in w growing pandemic. They used the term asymptomatic to scare people and justify the lockdowns. Anyone can be asymptomatic  a truly healthy person, a person with false positive test, a person with true positive test... what a load of crap. Show me a respiratory virus that spreads without symptoms - the whole point is to make you caugh and sneeze so you spread it.</p>
<p>Number two, please see the bigger picture here: this pandemic is being used as an excuse to implement new rules, control; it's a power grab and they are eradicating middle class. A year ago you wouldn't think we would be discussing vaccine digital passports allowing you to shop, work or travel, wearing social distance dog collars. In a year there will be no more jobs unless you work for Tesco or Amazon, we will be on UBI of ¬£7k a year so most of us will be homeless because that doesn't even cover mortgage.</p>

        <p>It's absolutely bullshit.  I'm going sum up and not provide links here yet; there's just a basic flawed premise in all of this with asymptomatic spread.  The way the PCR test is being used is so sensitive that it cannot distinguish between dead genetic fragments (from some prior contact with the virus or just due to the inaccuracy in the PCR configuration to begin with) in your nasal cavity versus live virus.  Someone can test positive who is TRULY non-infectious and be told they're asymptomatic.</p>
<p>So what I've heard is that the vaccine COULD suppress asymptomatic transmission.  lol.  Just digest that.  You bring up a good point about it being able to 'reduce symptoms to the point you're asymptomatic' but at the same time there is no conclusive evidence the vaccine prevents transmission at all, symptomatic or 'asymptomatic'</p>
<p>It's just several layers of bullshit.</p>
