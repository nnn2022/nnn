    <strong>An argument in opposition</strong>
    <p><p>I hope this post doesn’t get removed and maybe just maybe help change your minds. </p>
<p>Read til the end before commenting.</p>
<p>I’ve seen some arguments made on this subreddit and I’m not here to debunk them, but to give a new perspective on these issues. </p>
<p>Let’s begin</p>
<p>99.8% Survival rate:</p>
<p>I’ve seen this statistic thrown around in post and in comments sections, and I believe wether it’s true or not doesn’t take away from the argument you are trying to make. So yes, we know that the survival rate is very high, 99.8% is very good in comparison to more effective killers (more on that later), that is still a 0.2% death rate. For those of you who like big numbers 
529 thousand deaths. Millions of families have been affected just by death alone from this pandemic. Families losing Mothers, Fathers, children, grandparents. Since when did it become ok to not care about deaths. You all claim to care about these bigger killers, yet you won’t even join in to stop completely preventable deaths. </p>
<p>The greater killers: </p>
<p>“B-but they’re are things that kill more people than covid”. Ok and? Like seriously listen to what your saying actually listen. No death is ok. “Well we shouldn’t be putting all these resources to Covid when there are just more important things to worry about”, how the hell do you expect society to be able to tackle things like suicide, obesity, overdose, when we can’t even come together on a small issue. You all expect society to join with in fight of all these other issues, when you won’t even join us in the fight against Covid.</p>
<p>The media:</p>
<p>Yes the media should care about these bigger issues, but acting like the pandemic doesn’t matter isn’t a way to help get people on your side. You are excluding people who would probably be on your side if you weren’t trying to act like all of this doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>At the end of the day you can’t blame the media for not covering these bigger issues because that doesn’t get “clicks”. It’s on us to spread these issues in a PRODUCTIVE way because this is not productive.</p>
<p>In conclusion:</p>
<p>We all should be on the same side here. I can see you all actually care about people’s lives, but you have got to stop being ok with any preventable death, no matter what it is.</p>
<p>I hope you all have a great 2021, and sincerely hope that Covid doesn’t take someone in your life like it has many.</p></p>

        <p>The median age of people dying from COVID in the UK is 82, the average life expectancy in the UK is 81.6</p>
<p>None of these deaths should be considered 'preventable'.</p>
<p>People get old and die.</p>
<p>You need to accept this and live your life.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a 'preventable death' in a free society that is worth living in.</p>
<p>We could prevent car deaths by banning private use of cars, or drowning deaths by shutting all swimming pools.</p>
<p>But we don't.</p>

        <p>OP, I don’t need anybody on my side. The root of your delusion is that you think this is a football match where there is team A and team B. And it’s a battle to convince others to join your side. </p>
<p>There is many perspectives but one truth. You derive your truth from what you deem as credible sources. We argue the credibility to these sources. Since they are extremely bias and funded by the same institutions running the scam. Until you let go of your beliefs and faith in this bought institution you live in, you’ll continue to be trapped in delusion. </p>
<p>Here’s a small example and the smoking gun for just how things work in your religion of “science” </p>

        <p>It’s honestly pretty disappointing, and I really feel it should have been in testing for longer, and given more time to be made safer. However if people had properly social distanced and worn their mask, more time could have been sent making a vaccine, and it wouldn’t have been nearly as much of a pandemic if we people stayed home</p>

        <p>Okay, but I think you're undoing your own argument here.  You claimed something like, (I can't see it now and it's been deleted): "I can't agree with you, if you keep downplaying death."</p>
<p>But here you are, downplaying death by vaccination.</p>
<p>We could add in deaths because of the lockdowns.</p>
<p>Have you considered those deaths?  Do you believe those deaths are justified in order to save other lives?  Or how do you reconcile this in your mind given your previous claim to not downplay death?</p>

        <p>Your mind is very simple and believes things at their face value.
To even have a discussion worth while i have a question for you.
Do you believe or do you think there is a “shadow government”, “deep state” that has agenda to push on us?</p>

        <p>&rt;99.8% is very good</p>
<p>This also includes the incredibly old, and those who are very unhealthy with underlying conditions. The point is the the Average Joe has almost nothing to worry about, pending them even catching it in the first place. The thing that upsets me the most is how it's being treated as some kind of horrible, terrible thing that people of all ages are getting killed left and right by. Protect the vulnerable and take any and all personal precautions necessary to make yourself feel safe. Open up, and let people live their lives. No solution will ever be perfect, but it's as close to it as we can get.</p>
<p>&rt;Millions of families have been affected just by death alone from this pandemic.</p>
<p>And countless more have been harmed and killed by all of the mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns imposed by governments. Not to mention the obvious violation of basic liberties, rights, and freedoms. As someone young and healthy, I have a wayyyy higher chance of being harmed by the "cure" than by the virus itself. This "cure" has harmed essentially everyone - the tanked economy along with massive spikes in unemployment, poverty, home loss, obesity, missed health checks, starvation, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, domestic abuse, anxiety, depression, and suicide, amongst a plethora of other terrible things.</p>
<p>&rt;you won’t even join in to stop completely preventable deaths. </p>
<p>I hope you never drive a car and always wore a mask before last year, amongst numerous other things.</p>
<p>&rt;No death is ok.</p>
<p>The point is that people are flipping shit about this virus and encouraging we shut down the entire world until it can be eradicated, meanwhile giving zero shits about any other issue and/or preventable death category. We weigh risk vs. reward at every moment of every day.</p>
<p>&rt;when we can’t even come together on a small issue.</p>
<p>Translation: "You all need to agree with me."</p>
<p>&rt;The media:</p>
<p>My issue with the media is moreso how they're blatantly fear-mongering at every opportunity, whilst having a vested interest in keeping the public frightened. Apart from all of their massive biases, as well.</p>
<p>&rt;It’s on us to spread these issues in a PRODUCTIVE way</p>
<p>Rather, it's on us to take all of the information we can get access to, and make a rational and informed decision on how seriously we should personally be taking the virus, and the precautions we should personally take. Not the government, and not the mob. There's no reason that a young and healthy kid should be as afraid of this virus, and be taking the same precautions, as an obese 90 year old with numberous underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>&rt;We all should be on the same side here.</p>
<p>This is like the whole "This virus should not be politicized." mentality. I get the point, but something that impacts everyone in the world will always have a myriad of opinions and thoughts associated with it, particularly since there's so much conflicting information on the subject. I think it's important to realize the opinions of others and how there will always be dissenting ones, respect them, and move on. Live your life, I'll live mine. Win-win.</p>
<p>&rt;sincerely hope that Covid doesn’t take someone in your life like it has many.</p>
<p>Highly unlikely, but likewise to you regarding the massive amount of terrible things that happen to people as a direct result of governmental mandates, restrictions, and lockdowns.</p>
