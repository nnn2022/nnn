    <strong>What evidence convinced you herd immunity is real?</strong>
    <p><p>Your favorite skeptic scientist coming at you with another edition of why do you believe what you believe. This time, herd immunity. The basic concept is that there is some magic threshold of people who are resistant to some disease that makes the susceptible people not get it. This is the entire basis for the psyop of guilt tripping people into getting vaccines. Without that idea, you have no business even asking anyone if they are vaccinated because yours should work for you (assuming they work, which of course they don't). </p>
<p>So, give me your best evidence. I'm a reasonable guy, I'm more than happy to be convinced. What do you have beyond some doctor claiming it is real, or a cartoon showing it because that's all I've ever seen and its frankly insulting if that is as good as it gets. Can anyone give me some peer reviewed papers or other data that show this theory in practice, or otherwise demonstrate it being real? Thanks in advance!</p></p>

<p>Honestly, you shouldn't have to ask anyone that anyway. If you're worried about it, get the vaccine. Whether herd immunity is real or not.</p>

        <p>Sure. 
Herd immunity exists. It's a thing. The fact that we know about herd immunity and its existence is all I need to know. 
Re-reading your post...my comment does not provide you with the paper work you would like and I apologize for overlooking that. I will say though it isn't necessarily about individuals just magically having immunity to a virus. Its when an individual (person or animal) fights off the virus, and has the antibodies that will prevent them from getting the virus again by fighting it off. Its essentially the survivors and their offspring. If we are talking about a natural virus or illness it kind of comes down to survival of the fittest in a way as harsh as that may sound. Sometimes  we forget that we are part of the animal kingdom. We think we are above it because we call ourselves civilized, but we must still abide by the rules of nature.</p>

        <p>Alright. Let's see if you're as open to evidence as you claim to be.</p>
<p>First, the theory: Herd immunity is not magic, it's math. When modeling the spread of diseases, what matters is what's called the Reproduction Number (R0). This number is, essentially, how many people each infected person is likely to infect over the course of their illness. If that number is 1, the disease will remain steady (we call this "endemic"). If it's less than 1, the disease will die out because it's not spreading fast enough. If it's larger than 1, the disease will spread because each infected person will spread it to more than one other person before they are cured (or die, depending on the disease) and thus the total number of people infected increases over time. All public health measures are designed to reduce R0. Social distancing, wearing protective clothing, etc. all reduce R0 by lowering the likelihood that a person who is infected will transmit the disease to someone who is not. Quarantines, where people who are known to be infected are isolated from the rest of the population, work under the same principle. These attempts to reduce R0 all work by artificially lowering the likelihood that the disease will be passed on during contact with an uninfected person, but there is another way to reduce R0: reduce the percentage of the population which is vulnerable to the disease. That's herd immunity. Herd immunity is when R0 drops due to the fact that there are not enough people susceptible to catching the disease in the population to maintain an R0 greater than 1.</p>
<p>Think of it this way. Let's say a disease starts with a single person and nobody is immune to it. That one carrier has the ability to pass the disease on to everyone else with whom they come into contact. If the disease is particularly infectious, it will spread rapidly because there is an abundance of new hosts to infect, who will then infect even more hosts. Now, imagine half the population is naturally immune to this same disease. The chances that the disease will spread get cut in half because only one out of every two people are vulnerable to it. The math is inevitable: the larger the percentage of the population which has immunity to any disease, the lower the R0 for that disease because any infected person is less likely to find someone they can infect while they are still contagious. There exists for every disease a threshold of immunity within a population, dependent on how infectious the disease is, beyond which the R0 of that disease drops below 1 and it cannot continue to propagate. If that threshold is reached, the disease will eventually die out, protecting everyone who has yet to be infected.</p>
<p>This is, historically, why plagues ended. The way plagues work is either they kill you or you develop permanent immunity. So as a plague spreads through a population it reduces the percentage of the population which is vulnerable to it. This slows down it's spread until eventually herd immunity is reached and the disease dies out. Herd immunity isn't a new thing, and it doesn't need to be achieved through artificial vaccination; that's just a more humane and less destructive way of accomplishing it than just letting a disease run rampant in a population until herd immunity is reached naturally.</p>
<p>So that's the theory, and it relies entirely on the mathematical modeling of how diseases spread through a population. So now for the evidence: how do we know these models work in the real world?</p>
<p>The short answer is that we've seen it in action with a number of diseases. Measles is a very common example. We nearly eradicated it before the anti-vax movement started bringing it back. If you're looking for a complete success of herd immunity, then I would suggest reading up on smallpox and polio, both of which have been successfully eradicated thanks to vaccines and herd immunity.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Herd immunity is a mathematical inevitability of how diseases spread through populations. It's not new, it's not magic, it doesn't require artificial vaccines, we have seen it work worker with numerous diseases in the past, and it's not controversial epidemiology.</p>

Honestly just do a Google Scholar search for "herd immunity" and read everything not gated behind a paywall. There has been continuous research and publications about this since the 1950's.</p>

        <p>First of all, as I suspected there is no actual evidence, just a theory and some mathematical model. That doesn't cut it in science, except when it comes to The Science TM (ie vaccinology). It also has to assume unproven ideas about how disease is acquired. </p>
<p>How do you know that your theory is why plagues ended? You're making these huge leaps in logic and acting as those your explanation is the only valid one. I appreciate the effort to discuss it though.</p>

        <p>I have provided you with numerous examples of diseases which have been eradicated or nearly eradicated via herd immunity and papers from several peer reviewed journals dating back 40 years. So let me ask you this, "skeptic" what evidence would be sufficient to convince you? Because you clearly know absolutely nothing about epidemiology.</p>

        <p>The assumption is less infected = less transmission. It's bullshit, this isn't going away. Problem with all these so called experts is they put their thoughts and theories out there as scientific fact with nothing but a degree title to back it up.</p>

        <p>You're talking to a parent who didn't vaccinate their kid🤣 Healthiest kid that I or anyone knows. Caught rona and barely even knew he had it. The child has ZERO health problems. I get sick WAY more and I got a few vaccines in the 80s, boosters in the military, boosters for college, and a few flu vaccines. </p>

        <p>Vaccinated children are far less healthy, that is the dirty little secret. Crazy how the people who all have autoimmune disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, depression, take 12 medications want to lecture anyone about health. They use this lie that 99% of kids died of the measles to cope with the fact that no vaccine has ever been proven to work, and it is absolutely outrageous that 1/50 people have autism, 1/2 will get cancer, 1/5 have autoimmune disease and these are very new trends</p>

        <p>First of all, herd immunity as it is being pushed currently (achievable through vaccine only) is bullshit.  Herd immunity has historically been obtained through enough people in a population getting infected and developing antibodies so that a virus had a harder time jumping from person to person.  The classic example of this is cowpox.  Back in the day, Europeans lived among livestock and developed immunity to cowpox, which also offered a degree of protection from smallpox.  They brought smallpox with them to America and devastated a lot of native American communities who did not have any previous immunity to similar viruses (because they didn't live among livestock the way the Europeans did).</p>
<p>Vaccines can produce a similar effect, or at least that's how more traditional vaccines are designed - instead of everyone getting infected with the virus, vaccines with a weakened form of the virus can be introduced to the body, which in theory helps the body developing antibodies without experiencing the full effect of the virus itself.  This is very good for viruses with high mortality rates or horrific symptoms (think polio), where it wouldn't really be in anyone's best interest to risk obtaining herd immunity naturally.  Still, vaccines like any medicine, have risks that need to be weighed.</p>
<p>That said, mRNA vaccines seem to work exactly nothing like this, and it is perplexing as fuck to me that we are being told that a vaccine that doesn't necessarily stop transmission is required for herd immunity.  It's also extremely frustrating that the WHO changed the definition of herd immunity about a month before the vaccines rolled out.  There is a huge propaganda and coercion campaign behind a virus with a high survivability rate - I believe that the government would not have to force people's hands if this was like polio 2.0 (scary enough for people to be self-motivated), but it's just not.</p>
