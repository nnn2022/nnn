        <p>That data showed that most people who died of COVID had risk factors (OBESITY is one of the comorbidities mentioned - do you think these people just conveniently died from being fat after testing positive for covid?) or complications (it has been known since the beginning that COVID can cause pneumonia and cardiac arrest, for example).</p>

        <p>Perhaps 1.5-1.7% of those actually registered to have died of coronavirus. I remember someone posting a reply here from a hospital in Plymouth, UK where they had 200-300 registered covid deaths at that point (December 2020), however the hospital admitted that they had only five deaths due to actual covid in that year, the rest were just written down as covid as people tested positive in the preceding weeks.</p>

        <p>I don't think your source understands how PCR works</p>
<p>&rt;Everyone's favourite Doctor, Mr Anthony Fauci said in an interview back in November that a cycle threshold of over 35 is going to be detecting “dead nucleotides”, not a living virus.</p>
<p>&rt;And yet, what has most of the World been using as their threshold limit for positive infection?</p>
<p>&rt;You guessed, typically 35</p>
<p>Why is that a bad thing? A positive result with a threshold of 35 cycles would be any sample that crosses the threshold in <em>under</em> 35 cycles, not over 35. </p>
<p>Tests that use 40 cycles as the threshold include positives that took more than 35 cycles but it's hard to know how many without knowing the distribution. And even then, some of the results that took more then 35 samples could be actually covid positive.</p>
<p>Saying "so the tests are inaccurate" is jumping to conclusions and isn't actually justified by the sources you've posted. </p>
<p>Also, if the tests really are inaccurate and there are more false positives than we think, it means that the coronavirus is more dangerous, not less. </p>
<p>&rt;Even if you died of a clear alternative cause, but you had COVID at the same time, it's still listed as a COVID death.</p>
<p>It's not that simple - they're not listed as a covid death if they can prove that it wasn't Covid related.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why is that a bad thing? A positive result with a threshold of 35 cycles would be any sample that crosses the threshold in under 35 cycles, not over 35.</p>
<p>Hmm, you cut off the end of that quote from my source:</p>
<p>&rt;You guessed, typically 35, <strong>but sometimes as high as 40</strong>.</p>
<p>They didn't provide a source for the "typically 35" cycle threshold claim (perhaps countries besides the US and UK?), but I provided two that say a cycle threshold of 40 is used, one from the FDA, the other from Public Health England. Straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak.</p>
<p>Now bear with me while I throw some mud at the wall. If there is an insignificant number of positive results greater than 35Ct, surely the:</p>
<ul>
<li>threshold would be lowered to 35Ct.</li>
<li>number of cases wouldn't have plummeted after the WHO asked for more "careful interpretation of weak positive results."</li>
</ul>
<p>With the exception of <a href="https://www.flhealthsource.gov/files/Laboratory-Reporting-CT-Values-12032020.pdf">Florida</a>, it looks like most labs aren't reporting cycle values after testing. I don't think Florida has made their cycle values publicly available and I couldn't find any other data sets to work with. However, this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">NY Times article</a> brings some more things to light:</p>
<p>&rt;The C.D.C.’s own calculations suggest that it is <strong>extremely difficult</strong> to detect any live virus in a sample <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html"><strong>above a threshold of 33 cycles</strong></a>. Officials at some state labs said the <strong>C.D.C. had not asked them to note threshold values</strong> or to share them with contact-tracing organizations.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;[...]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“It’s just kind of mind-blowing to me that people are <strong>not recording the C.T. values</strong> from all these tests — that they’re just returning a <strong>positive or a negative</strong>,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;[...]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Officials at the Wadsworth Center, New York’s state lab, have access to C.T. values from tests they have processed, and analyzed their numbers at The Times’s request. In July, the lab identified 872 positive tests, based on a threshold of <strong>40 cycles</strong>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;With a cutoff of <strong>35</strong>, about <strong>43 percent</strong> of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About <strong>63 percent</strong> would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to <strong>30</strong>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In Massachusetts, from <strong>85 to 90 percent</strong> of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of <strong>40</strong> would have been deemed <strong>negative</strong> if the threshold were <strong>30</strong> <strong>cycles</strong>, Dr. Mina said. “I would say that none of those people should be contact-traced, not one,” he said.</p>
<p>Definitely something fishy going on here...</p>
<p>I only included sources to back up the high-PCR-cycle-threshold point I was making. I have more to say about the PCR test, but I couldn't fit it all in a single meme lol. Here's something I wrote a while ago:</p>
<p>&rt;Let's talk about a man names Kary Mullis. He invented the PCR test back in 1983 and has claimed that "<strong>it doesn't tell you that you're sick</strong>" and "<strong>you can find almost anything in anybody</strong>".<a href="https://lbry.tv/@UnMasked:2/Kary-Mullis-discusses-the-PCR-Test:1">[1]</a> He also explained how his test is used to create misleading statistics.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;[...]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Then there's the whole Tanzania situation where the president tested a goat and a pawpaw for the virus, both of which came back positive.<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/coronavirus-tanzania-test-kits-suspicion-goat-pawpaw-positive-a9501291.html">[5]</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;[...]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You probably hear quite often that the false positive rate of the PCR test is just a couple of percent or even less, but that is a clever misleading statistic they try to fool us with, it's actually much higher than that. They're referring to the percentage of false positives on ALL tests, not just positive results. E.g. If 5% of tests come back positive and 2.5% are false positives, that means half of the positives are false positives.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"DHSC figures show that 100,664 tests were carried out on 31 May 2020 (Pillar 1 and 2 RT-PCR tests). 1,570 of those tests were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (<strong>1.6%</strong>). The majority of people tested on that day did not have SARS-CoV-2 (98.4% of tests are negative). When only a small proportion of people being tested have the virus, the operational false positive rate becomes very important. Clearly <strong>the false positive rate cannot exceed 1.6% on that day</strong>, and is likely to be much lower. If the operational false positive rate was <strong>0.4%, 400 of the 1,570 positive tests would be false positives</strong>. That would represent 400 people being isolated when they are well, and much wasted effort in contact tracing. It is possible that a proportion of infections that we currently view as asymptomatic may in fact be due to these false positives." <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/895843/S0519_Impact_of_false_positives_and_negatives.pdf">[14]</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Even in the example they give, they use a very conservative estimate of 0.4% false positives. In the same document, it states that <strong>the median false positive rate is 2.3% and the interquartile range is 0.8-4.0%</strong>. The false positive rate being half the lower quartile would be a very rare outcome.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Once we know the test isn't as accurate as it seems, <strong>that invalidates the reliability of the death toll</strong>, and the excess deaths can be explained by the consequences of lockdowns and sterility on our immune systems.</p>
<p>I'd recommend this <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/06/27/covid19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/">Off-Guardian</a> article for further reading on the PCR test.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Also, if the tests really are inaccurate and there are more false positives than we think, it means that the coronavirus is more dangerous, not less.</p>
<p>Not necessarily - most people who died and had COVID written on their death certificate had one or more underlying conditions, which they could've died of, false positive or not. The truth is, we don't know.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;It's not that simple - they're not listed as a covid death if they can prove that it wasn't Covid related.</p>
<p>Here's two deaths that say otherwise:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/man-who-died-after-falling-from-ladder-ruled-a-coronavirus-death-by-doctors-report/ar-BB1bd6ND">Man died of COVID after falling from ladder</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/florida-health-official-admits-man-who-died-in-motorcycle-crash-listed-as-coronavirus-death">Man died of COVID after motorcycle crash</a></p>
<p>Here's a possible reason as to why it's happening:</p>
<p>&rt;Hospital administrators might well want to see COVID-19 attached to a discharge summary or a death certificate. Why? Because if it's a straightforward, garden-variety pneumonia that a person is admitted to the hospital for—if they're Medicare—typically, the diagnosis-related group lump sum payment would be <strong>$5,000</strong>,” said Jensen, whose claim was <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/04/24/fact-check-medicare-hospitals-paid-more-covid-19-patients-coronavirus/3000638001/">fact-checked</a> by USA Today. “But if it's COVID-19 pneumonia, then it's <strong>$13,000</strong>, and if that COVID-19 pneumonia patient ends up on a ventilator, it goes up to <strong>$39,000</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://fee.org/articles/physicians-say-hospitals-are-pressuring-er-docs-to-list-covid-19-on-death-certificates-here-s-why/">Physicians Say Hospitals Are Pressuring ER Docs to List COVID-19 on Death Certificates</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And I believe this is how it's happening:</p>
<p>&rt;In some situations, testing for COVID-19 may not be accessible, particularly for individuals who have a compatible but mild illness that does not warrant hospitalization and who do not have a known COVID-19 exposure or high-risk travel history.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In the United States, there is limited official guidance for this situation, and <strong>the approach may depend on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the area</strong>. If the clinician has sufficient concern for possible COVID-19 (eg, there is community transmission and there is no other apparent cause for the symptoms), it is <strong>reasonable to assume the patient had COVID-19</strong> and advise the patient to self-isolate at home (if hospitalization is not warranted) and alert the clinician about worsening symptoms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-diagnosis#!">COVID-19 Testing Not Readily Available</a></p>
<p>Suppose someone was diagnosed based on symptoms and their conditions worsened and the patient eventually died, it doesn't say whether the patient would have had to take a test.</p>
<p>And finally, here's some concrete evidence of diagnosis based on symptoms, however this is from the UK, which doesn't have the Medicare financial incentive:</p>
<p>&rt;For example, if before death the patient had symptoms typical of COVID19 infection, but the test result has not been received, it would be satisfactory to give 'COVID-19' as the cause of death.</p>

        <p>&rt;Definitely something fishy going on here...</p>
<p>Yeah, I have to admit that's actually quite disconcerting</p>
<p>&rt;Once we know the test isn't as accurate as it seems, that invalidates the reliability of the death toll,</p>
<p>Yes, but again the higher the false positive rate the more dangerous coronavirus is, all things being equal, so I hope the false positives are minimal.</p>
<p>&rt;Then there's the whole Tanzania situation where the president tested a goat and a pawpaw for the virus, both of which came back positive</p>
<p>Just going out on a limb here: I think it's more likely that a Tanzanian lab messed up or committed fraud than it is that PCR test doesn't work in general.</p>
<p>&rt; Not necessarily - most people who died and had COVID written on their death certificate had one or more underlying conditions, which they could've died of, false positive or not. The truth is, we don't know.</p>
<p>I agree, and this is why I find it alarming that people are saying that they're confident  that the coronavirus is no worse than the flu when they don't actually have sufficient evidence to justify that claim.</p>

<p>The point I was making is that even the fatalities might be due to one of the patient's other conditions. If they had a false positive and died of something else, that wouldn't affect the death rate. If they had a true positive and died of something else, that would lower the death rate. But of course as you said, false positives for non-fatal cases does increase the death rate. There's no way to know what someone died of, but COVID seems to be taking precedence, even over terminal illnesses.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I agree, and this is why I find it alarming that people are saying that they're confident that the coronavirus is no worse than the flu when they don't actually have sufficient evidence to justify that claim.</p>
<p>They probably say that by either only counting deaths with no co-morbidities or by assuming most of the population has already had the virus without knowing or being tested.</p>
<p>I believe this paper used the former argument to conclude that the CDC inflated deaths by 1600%:</p>
<p>&rt;For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19 , on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.</p>
<p><a href="https://jdfor2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/adf864_165a103206974fdbb14ada6bf8af1541.pdf">COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity &amp; Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective</a></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I took a look at the excess deaths of 2020 in the US and found that a third of them weren't even put down as COVID, deaths due to respiratory illnesses were down (misdiagnosed?) compared to 2019, and I mention some explanations for the increase in deaths:</p>
<p>&rt;CDC: "In 2019, a total of 2,854,838 resident deaths were registered in the United States."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I found two CDC spreadsheets showing stats about deaths from both 2019<a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-Counts-of-Deaths-by-State-and-Select-Causes/3yf8-kanr">[8]</a> and 2020<a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Weekly-Counts-of-Deaths-by-State-and-Select-Causes/muzy-jte6">[9]</a>. The 2020 total was 3,309,321.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That's an increase in all-cause deaths by 454,483 compared to 2019. Now, let's account for them:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The increase in natural-cause deaths was almost 5,000 less than that at 449,508.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If we add up the totals of the 11 causes of death in both years, we can see those incresed by 72,889.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That means we're left with an increase in deaths of 376,619, which can only be either COVID or something not included in the spreadsheet.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If we subtract those 11 causes from the total number of natural cause deaths, we can work out how many natural-cause deaths were due to either COVID or something else. The results:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;2019: 610,345<br>
2020: 986,964<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;This is correct because the difference between these numbers is the same as the remaining number of deaths we have to account for: 376,619.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;According to the 2020 spreadsheet, the total number of deaths where COVID was the underlying cause is 327,256.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;That means the other natural causes not included in the spreadsheet increased by 49,363.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So almost a third of the increase in deaths weren't due to COVID. Some were due to unnatural causes but most were from other reasons which increased because of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vital routine treatments like chemotherapy being delayed.</li>
<li>People being too scared to go to the hospital when they usually would.</li>
<li>People wearing masks for hours on end and reusing masks means breathing bacteria into the lungs.</li>
<li>Little exposure to germs and vitamin D from staying indoors and sanitising hands all day long reduce immune systems.</li>
<li>Fear, worry, stress and depression have all taken a toll on people's physical health.</li>
<li>Gyms closed and entertainment food means people have been gaining weight.</li>
</ul>
<p>&rt;Now lets explain the COVID deaths:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Take a look at the below screenshot comparing the numbers of the 11 causes between both years. The pink columns are causes that have flu-like symptoms or respiratory problems, the total of which is actually lower than in 2019, despite the above reasons as to why more people would be getting sick. These deaths could very easily be counted as COVID due to the fact that hospitals receive reimbursements from medicare for diagnosing patients with COVID<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/are-hospitals-using-covid-19-causes-of-death-as-financial-incentives/ar-BB14ZJGc">[10]</a> and doctors are being told to write COVID on death certificates based on symptoms alone: "For example, if before death the patient had symptoms typical of COVID19 infection, but the test result has not been received, it would be satisfactory to give 'COVID-19' as the cause of death."<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/877302/guidance-for-doctors-completing-medical-certificates-of-cause-of-death-covid-19.pdf">[11]</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/bkZZ3bc.png">https://i.imgur.com/bkZZ3bc.png</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Another source of CDC data shows only a couple dozen influenza deaths per week this flu season, when there are usually hundreds as in previous years.<a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/mortality.html">[12]</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The UK has seen a 95% drop in flu rate, which is the lowest it's been in 130 years.<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9206071/Flu-wiped-lowest-level-130-YEARS-seasonal-virus-plummets-95.html">[13]</a></p>
<p>If we assume that the non-COVID third of excess deaths were caused by lockdown measures (since several consecutive previous years had all-cause mortality fluctuations in the thousands, rather than hundreds of thousands), then out of the COVID two thirds of the remaining excess deaths, only a sixth of them would have to be due to lockdown measures for the measures to be just as deadly as COVID.</p>
<p>With almost all deaths being patients with underlying conditions, I'd argue that a sixth of the COVID deaths being wrong is a conservative estimate.</p>

        <p>I'm just going to be blunt here: I really have no reason to trust you over the epidemiologists. Like, I'm sure that covid deaths are overreported, but without also knowing the number of false positives it's not actually possible to tell if covid is actually deadlier or safer than we think.  </p>
<p>Seriously, why should I put more stock in some anonymous internet commenter over the people who are trained to do exactly this sort of work? Am I really supposed to believe that some random anonymous redditor is more qualified to sift though the evidence than trained, educated epidemiologists? Or that you're somehow more trustworthy? </p>
<p>I think you (and most of the people posting here) are employing motivated reasoning. You want "the lockdowns" to end, and to that end you'll throw crap at the wall to question the official narrative and see what sticks. So you'll insinuate that PCR tests don't work and hope that the people who read your comment don't realize that this makes the coronavirus more of a risk, not less of one. It's like you don't realize that that questioning the official narrative isn't actually a good reason to end lockdown measures, it just means we don't know.</p>
<p>But more to the point, the idea that ending the lockdowns is somehow going to make things go back to normal is ludicrous. Most people are staying home voluntarily, the lockdown mandates are meant for the edge cases and even then they're largely unenforced. Society is going to be forever changed regardless of what the government does, it's unavoidable.</p>

<p>Good, I don't want anyone to blindly believe what I say, or what anyone else says for that matter. That's why I provide sources to all my claims so you can do your own research. Most people get their information from the "news", but they seldom provide sources so it's based on blind faith, not trust. When you start looking at alternative media, you'll find nothing but sources because they can't rely on the unquestioning public like MSM does.

<p>&rt;You want "the lockdowns" to end, and to that end you'll throw crap at the wall to question the official narrative and see what sticks.</p>
<p>I do want them to end. I believe they're causing more harm than good. I also believe they're being used to push a greater agenda. But that doesn't make the evidence I've presented any less relevant. It's inherent that everyone on this sub wants lockdowns to end, otherwise we wouldn't say anything. All I can do is show you my research, it's then up to you to take a look for yourself and come to your own conclusions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So you'll insinuate that PCR tests don't work and hope that the people who read your comment don't realize that this makes the coronavirus more of a risk, not less of one.</p>

<p>People are staying home because they're either scared by the lying MSM, or they're scared of being fined. The mandates are enforced - people have been imprisoned for opening their businesses, not accepting fines for being outside, walking to work, recording hospitals, protesting, hosting mass, etc. We're living in a police state. People can do as they like, I don't have a problem with that, as long as they don't force it onto others who want to go back to their lives and not live in fear and under draconian laws.</p>

<p>I just think it's immensely arrogant of someone to think that they know how to asses the evidence better than the actual epidemiologists when they have no experience or training in the field.</p>
<p>Seriously: have you ever done research in a professional capacity at all before? I doubt you have a clue as to what you are doing.</p>
<p>&rt;People are staying home because they're either scared by the lying MSM, or they're scared of being fined. </p>
<p>People are staying home because they know people who have died from the coronavirus or because they live with someone who has comorbidities or because they themselves have comorbidities or because they they don't want to risk losing their sense of smell or face other long term effects etc.</p>
<p>So yes, they're staying home because they're scared - not necessarily for themselves - and because people like you are completely unqualified at assessing the actual risks.</p>
<p>&rt;The mandates are enforced</p>
<p>When my state governor issued shelter in place order, the local government almost immediately defined all businesses in the county as "essential businesses" in order to circumvent the order. </p>
<p>Enforcement of the mandates is spotty at best.</p>
<p>&rt;We're living in a police state. </p>
<p>Ok buddy. If that's really what you think you have no sense of proportion.</p>

<p>But you're not a doctor and you don't know how to asses their expertise, so you're just looking for sources who tell you what you want to believe.</p>
<p>&rt;A rushed vaccine is clearly not in the public’s best interest.</p>
<p>I think it very clearly is in the public interest to roll out a vaccine quickly because <em>we are in a pandemic</em>. The coronavirus vaccines are getting a ton of extra attention so I don't think expediting the process actually translates to a lack of oversight.</p>
<p>&rt; Breathing, hugging, visiting loved ones, operating your business, etc. has only been "dangerous" the last year</p>
<p>You're right, people just randomly decided these things are dangerous because they're all just fascists who hate basic human contact are looking for an excuse to throw people in jail. It's not because people are potentially infected with a deadly virus.</p>
<p>Is that it?</p>
<p>&rt;And the stats we're being shown to make us believe that we're a danger to others is at the very least questionable.</p>
<p>Yes, statistics are always "questionable", because statistics don't give you certainty and aren't meant to.</p>
<p>The moral difference between anti-maskers and the guy who goes drunk driving "because government car accident statistics are totally made up" is negligible.</p>

        <p>At first, it was my source-backed points vs you playing devil's advocate.</p>
<p>Then you said I'm not qualified like the epidemiologists, so I found you some qualified doctors who say the same things as I did.</p>
<p>Now you're saying I can't assess the expertise of those doctors, which I only brought up in the first place because you said <em>you</em> can't assess my expertise. To what end? How do you know you can trust the expertise of the mysterious epidemiologists you keep talking about? Why not do your own research, hear doctors' opinions, and decide for yourself?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I think it very clearly is in the public interest to roll out a vaccine quickly because <em>we are in a pandemic</em>.</p>
<p>And here comes the uno reverse card: The bullet point you're disagreeing with comes from the World Doctors Alliance. My response to you is: "But you're not a doctor and you don't know how to asses their expertise, so you're just looking for sources who tell you what you want to believe."</p>
<p>We're going in circles here. I've given you my reasons as to why I don't believe the case numbers and death counts. I've also given you sources to look into and do your own research, as well as groups of doctors who came to the same conclusions as I did. Once you couldn't discredit my points, you tried to discredit me, which suggests you're the one who doesn't want to change their mind. As they say, you can lead a horse to water...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;people are potentially infected with a deadly virus.</p>
<p>...based on statistics that are at the very least questionable. I don't think they're questionable, I think they've been intentionally manipulated. They are however questionable, even to those who disagree with me, since <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-uk-wide-methodology-agreed-to-record-covid-19-deaths">they've already been changed after being admitted to be inaccurate</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The moral difference between anti-maskers and the guy who goes drunk driving "because government car accident statistics are totally made up" is negligible.</p>
<p>First off, I made a rational case with sources to back up my claim that the stats are false - and I recall you even agreed that they were "disconcerting". Second, there's a big difference between coming into human contact consensually and driving under the influence of drugs. And finally, masks is a petty point, we're against the new normal, not masks. Read this comment I wrote to someone else:</p>
<p>&rt;I say this all the time, it's not about the masks. Nobody here gives a shit about the masks. We care about the increase in suicides, depression and other mental health issues, domestic violence, the wealth gap, decline in quality of life, loss of freedoms, loss of millions of jobs and small businesses, hyperinflation, missed cancer screenings and chemotherapy as well as other routine operations, the homeless - nobody walks past them anymore and when they do they keep their distance i.e. no-one gives them money, the experimental vaccines being forced onto everyone, people losing their right to practise religion, to protest, to see their loved ones - hell, children have died in hospitals alone because staff wouldn't allow their parents to see them. It makes me fucking sick. And people think we're just whining about fucking masks. This is NoNewNormal. If we don't put a stop to this, all the above will be considered normal and that's a world I don't wanna live in.</p>
<p>Please, just take a look at the research and doctors for yourself. It's your decision at the end of the day.</p>

        <p>&rt;The UK government and the devolved administrations have agreed to publish the number of deaths that occurred <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;within 28 days<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; of a positive lab-confirmed COVID test result on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The death within 28 days of positive test was intended for surveillance purposes (to be indicative, not absolute) and does not necessarily reflect what is written on the "medical certificate cause of death".</p>
<p>Further to this, not all covid deaths would be accompanied by a laboratory test, So would not be counted in the death within 28 days statistics. It can go both ways.   </p>
<p>I would add between March 20 and January 21, there been 104,000 excess deaths and 100,000 cumulative "deaths within 28 days" These two figures corresponded well and does not suggest covid deaths have been inflated.</p>

<p>I expect the media to ratchet this message up to 11 in the near future.  Some "new strain" will appear, they'll pull the same tricks to get the death counts where they want them to be, and there will be a new round of even harsher lockdown measures.  And the beleaguered public will be looking for someone to blame...</p>

        <p>Its giving doomers a lot of credit to show them reaching the right conclusion in the panels on the right. </p>
<p>I've had all of these conversations with a doomer family member and its honestly like talking to a wall. </p>
<p>Actual conversations I have had that involve pretty much all these topics</p>
<p>1) PCR tests cycling too much was right-wing propaganda that didn't undrestand the science. </p>
<p>2) Counting cases within a month is perfectly reasonable because covid caused all of the heart attacks and strokes and he even claimed the guy falling off the ladder was justified because "covid probably made him pass out he wouldn't have fallen if he didn't have covid"</p>
<p>3) Cases dropped after the WHO and CDC changed guidelines. "Well you have to understand this is Trump vs Biden. Biden will be much more careful so its ok to change the guidelines and science changes anyway so I don't see what the big deal is." </p>
<p>4) Cuomo ordering old people back into homes and killing them was "using the best available science at the time" and opposing him sets him off on a "Well do you think Trump was better!" rant every time. </p>
<p>5) Newsom dining at the French Laundry and keeping his winery open was totally fine because "All of his guests got tested and were being safe and people who go to a winery are the type of people who will be careful." </p>
<p>He also thinks schools should stay shut for an entire additional year "just to be safe". </p>
<p>Recently I sent him the Nature article about how lockdowns were shown to do more harm than good in 87 countries. Blew right past the fact that it was a GLOBAL study and he replied back with "I'm not even going to bother reading that. All stuff like that ever shows is that Trumptards didn't follow the fucking rules and ruined the world for us."  So I replied and said this is a global study in 87 countries and they all reached the same conclusion. His reply, "Yeah that people are selfish stupid covidiot pieces of shit that won't just follow the fucking rules." </p>
<p><a href="https://www.nzdoctor.co.nz/article/undoctored/study-highlights-moralisation-covid-response-and-restrictions">Funny thing is a professor in New Zealand of all places conducted a study back in July and got it published that shows exactly that mentality. It's basically a cult. You literally cannot change their mind and when presented with evidence they just believe their stance even harder. And if you click through to the actual study one of the funny findings is that the more left-wing you are the more you support viewing covid as the only problem to address.</a></p>
<p>And my family member fits the doomer stereotype to a T. Super left wing software engineer. Supports $15 minimum wage on top of a UBI. Wants rent control in all major cities and wants to see cars banned. Decided to pull his kids out of school because of "covidiot administrators" opening schools A FULL FUCKING YEAR after this started. And he hasn't been inconvenienced at all. He has been working from home for a decade doing his IT stuff and his wife doesn't work. He also lives on 5 acres so he is constantly "I don't see why this is so hard. Staying home is the easiest thing you can do."</p>

        <p>You're right with that. He is the type of guy who responds to every criticism of environmental stuff with "WE ARE IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY!" </p>
<p>Me - "I mean... shouldn't we find a way to help all the coal miners retrain and find new work before we just shut the mines and throw thousands of men into joblessness... that sort of stuff breeds Trump populism." </p>
<p>Him - WE ARE IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY WE CANT AFFORD TO WAIT AND IF YOU STILL WORK A COAL JOB YOU ARE TOO STUPID TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN COMING FOR DECADES!! </p>
<p>Me - "I mean ok I see the need for cleaner sources of power but if you just look at one statistic like oil consumption or coal burned you miss out on the fact that converting everyone to electric cars requires an increase in mining by like... 1000% and those mines are even more environmentally destabilizing than drilling for oil." </p>
<p>Him - "WE ARE IN A CLIMATE EMERGENCY! WE CAN FIGURE ALL OF THAT OUT LATER BUT SOLAR AND WIND IS THE FUTURE!!!!! WE WILL ALL DIE BY 2030 IF WE DON'T ACT NOW!" </p>
<p>Also supports a total ban on recreational air travel... supports a ban on the entire cruise industry. He literally told me "we've had video conferencing for years there is no such thing as a "necessary" face to face meeting." </p>
<p>The funny thing is he isn't dumb. He's an incredibly talented software engineer. but outside of his skillset he just cannot process how the world actually works. Everything to him is a reductionist problem to be solved in isolation of everything else.</p>

        <p>Ok. So. Why do you think anyone wants people to wear masks? You say there is a big conspiracy there, but to do what? What is the goal? And how is literally every country involved without a single person snitching and providing evidence of this conspiracy? And how do you fake dead people? How do explain that during covid 3 times more people died than during the same weeks before covid?</p>

        <p>I recommend this <a href="https://lbry.tv/@IvorCummins:f/Best-Geopolitical-Documentary-Ever---Explains-Near-Everything-720:9">mini documentary</a> to find your answers.</p>
<p>I'll answer some of your questions here though:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Why do you think anyone wants people to wear masks?</p>
<p>I say this all the time, it's not about the masks. Nobody here gives a shit about the masks. We care about the increase in suicides, depression and other mental health issues, domestic violence, the wealth gap, decline in quality of life, loss of freedoms, loss of millions of jobs and small businesses, hyperinflation, missed cancer screenings and chemotherapy as well as other routine operations, the homeless - nobody walks past them anymore and when they do they keep their distance i.e. no-one gives them money, the experimental vaccines being forced onto everyone, people losing their right to practise religion, to protest, to see their loved ones - hell, children have died in hospitals alone because staff wouldn't allow their parents to see them. It makes me fucking sick. And people think we're just whining about fucking masks. This is NoNewNormal. If we don't put a stop to this, all the above will be considered normal and that's a world I don't wanna live in.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;What is the goal?</p>
<p>Power. Money. Control.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And how is literally every country involved without a single person snitching and providing evidence of this conspiracy? </p>
<p>Not every country has sold out, see Sweden, <a href="https://www.advocate.com/world/2020/11/11/brazil-president-bolsonaro-we-have-stop-being-country-f-gs">Brazil</a>, Mexico, <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/12/19/how-belarus-exposes-the-lockdown-lie/">Belarus</a>, Nicaragua, Tanzania, etc. Thousands have spoke out (<a href="https://worlddoctorsalliance.com/">here</a> and <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/">here</a>), but you'll never hear about them on mainstream media. Why? The World Economic Forum are the ones running the show. They're a group made up of representatives from thousands of the biggest corporations, universities, media, governments, etc. in the world. The following media companies are part of that group:</p>
<ul>
<li>CNN</li>
<li>BBC</li>
<li>The Guardian</li>
<li>Daily Mail</li>
<li>ITV News</li>
<li>Sky News</li>
<li>Channel 4 News</li>
<li>CNBC</li>
<li>NBC</li>
<li>Wikimedia</li>
<li>Bloomberg</li>
<li>Fox News</li>
<li>CBS News</li>
<li>ABC News</li>
<li>Newsweek</li>
<li>Forbes</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/AM13/WEF_AM13_Participants_34ezx6jlxk.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>The WEF met in late 2019 for a coronavirus pandemic "simulation" exercise called Event 201. Coincidentally, this happened just a few months before the WHO declared a coronavirus pandemic. You can still watch the <a href="https://lbry.tv/@TRUCKENATOR:3/EVENT-201-FULL-LENGTH-PLANDEMIC-SIMULATION:5">full thing</a>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And how do you fake dead people?</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://lbry.tv/COVID-Deception:b">post</a> about how the tests are fraudulent, the deaths are inflated, many of the excess deaths aren't due to COVID, and who's orchestrating it.</p>

        <p>Ok so you are definetly wrong about people giving a shit about masks. If this where the case and everybody would wear one, we would have far less of the things you listed as realy important because infections would be limited and lockdown would be shorter.</p>
<p>And yes I agree that masks are not the problem. And yes I agree that lockdown are bad for mental health, experiencing this myself.</p>
<p>But things like decline in quality of life and freedom are kind of stupid point because we are in a extfeme situation. Its like saying war is bad because of decline in quality of life. Yeah its bad, but people fucking die and your quality of life can suffer a bit to save lives.</p>
<p>This is no new normal, you are absolutly right and no one says it is. its a necessary thing we have to do until people are vaccinated. </p>
<p>Talking about vaccination, you don’t have to take it if you don’t want to. But if you don’t you should be last in the list of people getting a hospital bed.  </p>
<p>So next the conspiracy. Funnily all the countries you listed as not beeing part of it are the ones who either changed their course after a while like Sweden ore the ones that have significantly higher death rates, like Brazil. I wonder why.
And power, money, control?
You really couldn’t be less specific right?
Money yes, some people got richer, some lost alot. Thats capitalism for you. But power? Who got any power? People lost power because the public wasn’t satisfied about how the pandemic was handled. And control? Control of what? People staying home and the economy loosing hard? Yeah right.</p>
<p>And then the deaths. Your post comes to the conclusion that around 400000 people died of covid despite the measures. I think thats pretty much in line with what everybody is saying. I don’t get how you come to the conclusion that this is insignificant. 
There are very little flu cases this season, maybe because everybody is staying home and wearing a mask? Doesn’t that prove my point? Imagine if we just stopped lockdowns and mask mandates.</p>

        <p>Your reply is filled with the assumption that government does things in the best interest of the people. High ranking government officials are in the WEF, they're in on it.</p>
<p>You contradict yourself by saying we would have limited infections if people wore masks, then you say we have no flu because people are wearing masks.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;But things like decline in quality of life and freedom are kind of stupid points because we are in an extreme situation.</p>
<p>It's only an extreme situation if you believe in the number of cases and deaths etc. When you realise that a third of the deaths aren't due to COVID, the tests are intentionally giving false positives, the COVID deaths are all-cause deaths that occur within 28 days of a positive (which is likely to be a false positive) - it's not an extreme situation. We're "protecting" old people by locking them in care homes, not allowing them to hug their loves ones, scaring them to death, etc. What's the point in extending their lifespan if their lives are miserable?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;This is no new normal, you are absolutely right and no one says it is. its a necessary thing we have to do until people are vaccinated.</p>
<p>If the WEF gets what they want, this is here to stay. It's not until people are vaccinated, the goal posts keep moving. Look at the <a href="https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/timeline-lockdown-web.pdf">UK lockdown timeline</a>. First it was 2 weeks to flatten the curve, then it got extended, then local lockdowns came in, then we had a 3 tier system, then another national lockdown, then a four tier system, then a third national lockdown, now we're waiting until everyone is vaccinated.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Talking about vaccination, you don’t have to take it if you don’t want to. But if you don’t you should be last in the list of people getting a hospital bed.</p>
<p>Now places like Israel have already rolled out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/28/green-pass-how-are-vaccine-passports-working-in-israel">vaccination passports</a>, they have <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/israel-adopts-law-allowing-names-153232886.html">lists of people refusing vaccination</a>. Kids will have to be constantly tested and <a href="https://twitter.com/BreesAnna/status/1366074238327812101">prove they're negative</a> to go to school. They've developed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thecommonsproject.android.commonpass">an app</a> for you to prove you've tested negative before you can go anywhere. They wouldn't have spent billions on these projects if it wasn't here to stay. It's the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/theres-nothing-new-about-this-new-normal-heres-why/">new normal</a>, the <a href="https://greatreset.com/">great reset</a>, <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/outcomedocuments/agenda21">agenda 21</a>, <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/">agenda 2030</a>, it's all planned, and it ain't going away easily.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Funnily all the countries you listed as not being part of it are the ones who either changed their course after a while like Sweden or the ones that have significantly higher death rates, like Brazil.</p>
<p>I didn't know Sweden went into lockdown, maybe they sold out after all, their stats still seem to be <a href="https://off-guardian.org/wp-content/medialibrary/Eu6iaFhXcAIMUNj.jpg">consistent</a> though. And Brazil has a lot of cases, not deaths. If you look at the <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries">deaths per million</a>, Brazil is even lower than Sweden at #25, the UK is #6 and the USA is #11. But again, that's if you believe in the case and death numbers. And you were quick to say "all the countries" but only mentioned two of them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And power, money, control? You really couldn’t be less specific right? Money yes, some people got richer, some lost alot. Thats capitalism for you. But power? Who got any power? People lost power because the public wasn’t satisfied about how the pandemic was handled. And control? Control of what? People staying home and the economy loosing hard? Yeah right.</p>
<p>Money:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/19/ten-billionaires-reap-400bn-boost-to-wealth-during-pandemic">Bezos made 70 billion since lockdowns started</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zShkBl5phUs">Gates is laughing at the destroyed economy</a></p>
<p><a href="https://lbry.tv/@Meginwolf:7/Gates-makes-a-big-profit:b">Gates makes 20 to 1 returns on vaccines</a></p>
<p>The rich get richer, the poor get poorer. The rich are the members of the WEF and are the ones orchestrating the whole thing.</p>
<p>Power:</p>
<p>Look at all the people begging for money now. Stimulus, furlough, etc. is a soft transition to UBI. That means if you don't comply with governments, no money for you. You won't have a choice but you comply. Debt forgiveness programs are also on the way - "you will own nothing an you will be happy". This is how they'll transition us into 2030 smart cities, just like the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/">WEF has planned</a>. You'll have no privacy, no property, no income, no self sufficiency, nothing at all. And they've told us this.</p>
<p>Control:</p>
<p>People have been arrested for: walking to work, sitting outside on their own, visiting family, walking on a beach alone, hosting mass, opening their businesses, going to a gym, protesting, organising a protest on facebook, attending a farmer's market, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>Doctors and nurses have been fired for speaking out, everyone gets silenced and  censored for speaking against the narrative, even a US president, people are told they have to get tested and isolate when it's against the constitution and <a href="https://lbry.tv/@scamdemic:7d/chrissky:9">unenforceable</a>.</p>
<p>Vaccination passports are being rolled out, tracking and tracing apps, proof of a negative test result, etc. Now tell me governments haven't gained more control over the people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And then the deaths. Your post comes to the conclusion that around 400000 people died of covid despite the measures. I think thats pretty much in line with what everybody is saying.</p>
<p>My post says 327,256, not 400,000 because it's only looking at the 2020 data. I gave reasons for why the causes of deaths may be higher. I also show that a third of the deaths didn't have COVID written on the death certificate.</p>

        <p>I don’t contradict myself at all. At least 3/4 of people wear masks and stay home. Thats why there is basically no flu this season. But covid is far more contagious and you can be asymptomatic and still spread it so in my opinion 3/4 in not enough to open things back up. But thats really an opinion and debatable I give you that.</p>
<p>But how the fuck do you think this is not an extreme situation? Even if you say “only” 320000 people died, and even you say its that in 2020 alone this is more then in ww2! How is this not extreme? And where did you get the information that test are giving false positives intentionally? </p>
<p>And then there is your list of countries. I picked two random ones but Mexico has in fact a mortality rate of 9,2% with 2000000 cases so yeah well done by them I guess.</p>
<p>And yes the rich get richer, thats why people want to tax them more. Buts its not like they didn’t get richer before covid, its just that if you are stuck at home you order more shit on amazon. Some business model profit more some less, some go bankrupt, thats capitalism. I don’t support that, I think small businesses like restaurants should recieve money from the government that can be collected by taxing the companies that profit like Amazon, but that has nothing to do with covid.</p>
<p>And yes people get arrested for stupid shit but endangering other isn’t that. Please give me some examples where someone arrested without reason. At least where I am from protest are still allowed, you just have to wear a mask. Going to the beach is still allowed, you just have to wear a mask and keep distance to other.</p>
<p>And yes there are vaccination passports and stuff, but I think that makes total sense. Until enough people are vaccinated you cannot open things back up fully. So there are two options. Keep them closed until everybody had their shot or open them for those who had. Like you said lockdown sucks so I will take option 2. And experimental technology is just not an argument againt vaccination. There are new types of vaccines using rna and stuff but there are conventional one too. And you can decide wich one you want.</p>

        <p>&rt;And where did you get the information that test are giving false positives intentionally?</p>
<p>Once the test is invalidated, so is the death toll (most deaths had underlying conditions so even COVID positives wouldn't have necessarily died of COVID). I already linked you a full comment thread talking about the PCR fraud:</p>
<p>&rt;Also check this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/m3ncmo/why_do_i_even_bother/gqrfl9p?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">comment thread</a> for a deeper dive into the PCR test fraud and death inflation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And then there is your list of countries. I picked two random ones but Mexico has in fact a mortality rate of 9,2% with 2000000 cases so yeah well done by them I guess.</p>
<p>We're comparing two different things. You're looking at IFR, I'm whereas I'm looking at deaths per million. My reason for this is that the tests have a high false positive rate, so IFR isn't accurate. Mexico is #17 for deaths per million, the UK is #6, the US is #11. If lockdowns worked, countries like the US and UK would have way less deaths than Mexico and Brazil.</p>
<p>Besides, there's no way to stop a virus completely, we were told that a year ago - lockdown was only to flatten the curve, not prevent infection. So that's why I think deaths are more important than IFR - we're all going to have the virus eventually, right?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;but that has nothing to do with covid.</p>
<p>The wealth gap increase isn't to do with the virus, but it's to do with the agenda being pushed onto us. Please watch <a href="https://lbry.tv/@IvorCummins:f/Best-Geopolitical-Documentary-Ever---Explains-Near-Everything-720:9">the documentary</a> I told you about - it's only 30 minutes but it explains perfectly why the WEF wants us broke. It's the 4th industrial revolution.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Please give me some examples where someone arrested without reason.</p>
<p>Reason is subjective. IMO, the following are without reason:</p>
<p><a href="https://lbry.tv/@The-Dollar-Vigilante:6/Man-Arrested-Standing-Up-For-His-Wife-Dollar-Vigilante-1:4">Man arrested on walk with grieving wife</a></p>
<p><a href="https://lbry.tv/@SovereignNews:2/Man-Arrested-For-Hugging-People-In-UK:0">Man arrested for hugging consenting people</a></p>

<p><a href="https://lbry.tv/@RealNewsforever:a/Canadian-Police-Raid-Citizens-Home:c">Police invade home for having visitors - Canadian edition</a></p>
<p>For more, there's a little montage at the start of that documentary I told you about.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And experimental technology is just not an argument againt vaccination. There are new types of vaccines using rna and stuff but there are conventional one too. And you can decide wich one you want.</p>
<p>Every vaccine has only been approved for emergency use and <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/03/what-vaccine-trials/">have barely been trialled</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;On the <strong>2nd of December 2020</strong>, UK regulators approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on an emergency-use basis. This date was just <strong>seven months</strong> after clinical trials started. They were able to do this at super fast speed by analysing the trial data continuously, rather than waiting until the end of all the trials.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;30 December 2020 – <strong>Approval of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.</strong> The second COVID-19 vaccine is approved for emergency use in the UK.</p>

        <p>Ok so if test aren’t valid how do all those people die? I mean they are dead thats something you cannot deny. And yes underlying condition of course play a role, but do you think these peoples lives are worth less or what is your point there? 3 times more people died in comparison to years before covid per week. Thats a fact and even if test don’t work these numbers are correct and that would only mean less actual infection and therefore a higher mortality rate. </p>
<p>And your examples literally prove my point. The man hugging people was not wearing a mask on public ground and resisted to put one on. The ones arrested in their home had guests that shouldn’t have been there. Maybe arrests are to harsh and a fine would have done the trick but still they did something illegal so yeah.  </p>
<p>And yes you can stop viruses completely, what do you thing happend to smallpox? </p>
<p>And yes vaccines had a small testing window but that is to make lockdowns shorter and get back to normal as soon as possible. You should support that. Thats why its voluntary to take it but it. You can wait another tear and then we will know more about possible side effects.</p>
<p>And if you don’t agree with capitalist agendas don’t vote for people like Trump or Biden but vote for Sanders ore AOC. Capitalism is extracting as much money out of people. Did you really think people wouldn’t use covid to make money?</p>

<p>Show me a source on this. Everything I've claimed has a source</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;they did something illegal</p>
<p>Does law define your sense of morality?  Masks aren't mandatory outside in the UK. I can't believe you think people should be punished for HUGGING each other with consent.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And yes you can stop viruses completely, what do you thing happend to smallpox?</p>
<p>Fair enough, I guess it is technically possible. Now let's be realistic: smallpox is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eradication_of_infectious_diseases">only human virus to be eradicated</a> deliberately out of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3427559/">219</a> human viruses. And look how long it took:</p>
<p>&rt;Smallpox remains the only human disease to be eradicated globally, and it took <strong>184 years</strong> between the development of the first-ever vaccine in 1796 to its eradication in 1980.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-it-took-184-years-to-eradicate-smallpox-after-vaccine-2020-5?r=US&amp;IR=T">Source</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And yes vaccines had a small testing window but that is to make lockdowns shorter and get back to normal as soon as possible. You should support that. Thats why its voluntary to take it but it. You can wait another tear and then we will know more about possible side effects.</p>
<p>As someone who isn't at risk whatsoever, it doesn't make sense for me to take a vaccine that hasn't been tested. And are you sure it's voluntary? Perhaps, if you don't want to rejoin society. Israel has already placed restrictions on those without their vaccination passport:</p>
<p>&rt;green pass holders get exclusive access to gyms, hotels, theatres, and concerts, albeit with some limits. Indoor dining in restaurants and bars is due to be included in the green pass scheme next week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/28/green-pass-how-are-vaccine-passports-working-in-israel">Green pass: how are Covid vaccine passports working for Israel?</a></p>
<p>And another year isn't long enough to see long term effects. See this other comment I made to someone about why I won't take a vaccine that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was developed in under a year instead of the usual 5-10+ years <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/vaccine-development-barriers-coronavirus/">[1]</a></li>
<li>Hasn't been properly trialled <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/03/what-vaccine-trials/">[2]</a></li>

<li>Has only been approved for emergency use <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">[7]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&rt;And if you don’t agree with capitalist agendas don’t vote for people like Trump or Biden but vote for Sanders ore AOC. Capitalism is extracting as much money out of people. Did you really think people wouldn’t use covid to make money?</p>
<p>I'm in favour of capitalism, it's governments I'm against. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Shitstatistssay/comments/m2w8cn/so_everyone_just_deserves_to_get_a_place_to_live/gqntox3/?context=3">this comment</a> about what the state does to keep people homeless. And see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/COMPLETEANARCHY/comments/m3iiw7/the_nazis_were_socialists/gqq0e0s/?context=3">this comment</a> about why the west isn't capitalist.</p>
<p>Also I'm an anarchist so I don't vote. It's an illusion of choice, you just get to decide who is the figurehead of an oppressive organisation running a legal protection racket which steals 60% of your money and lies to you for four years, every four years.</p>
<p>If governments wouldn't have shut down the economy and printed <a href="https://www.somagnews.com/9-trillion-story-22-of-us-dollars-printed-in-2020/#:~:text=Research%20shows%20that%20the%20Federal,the%20market%20since%20September%202019">22% of all dollars in circulation last year</a>, the billionaires wouldn't have made that much.</p>

        <p>Here you go: https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid
And no law doesn’t define my sense of morality, endangering people by not wearing a mask, a simple thing that doesn’t cost you anything except a little inconvenience is highly immoral in my eyes. Its not the hugging that makes me think he is not victim.</p>
<p>And yes eradicating covid is highly unlikely, but herd immunity trough vaccination is very much possible.</p>
<p>And yes you may not be at risk, neither am I really, but my grandparents are. Everyone over 60 in fact is. The point is, I don’t care if I get it, but I care about those who can’t handle such a disease and you should to. You are not the most important person on earth.</p>
<p>I understand people who want to wait with vaccination. I get it its not really tested to well. But I will guarantee you noone in any western country will be forced to take it. You may have to wait with getting back to normal a little longer but thats entirely your decision.</p>
