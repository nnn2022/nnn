        <p>My previous post was titled "Gym Bro was spot on a year ago" and it was gaining hundreds and hundreds of upvotes per hour and about 30 comments per hour, this then abruptly stopped. I thought something was fishy so I checked my profile and the video was still there, but then I thought I would check if it is actually ON the sub and it is NOT! Reddit did this without notifying me at all.</p>
<p>The original post is still up on my profile with the same title of "Gym Bro was spot on a year ago", type that into the search bar and see if my post comes up! When I did it it did not show up. It also didn't show up when I filtered by Top Posts of the Day.</p>
<p>Reddit is CENSORING this video COVERTLY thinking nobody would take notice.</p>
<p>SPREAD THIS VIDEO EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p>Here is the link to my original post which is still viewable (at least to me) on my profile: https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ou83gz/gym_bro_was_spot_on_a_year_ago/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</p>
