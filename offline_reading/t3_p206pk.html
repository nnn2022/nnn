        <p>It's like they're SO close to working this shit out but there's a block on their brain preventing them from thinking critically.</p>
<p>Also, there was one great comment in that thread:</p>
<p>The major debate over the vaccine is the lack of FDA testing it's <br>
undergone. It may deter covid now, but what is it going to cause down <br>
the line? There have been no significant studies into it's effects <br>
beyond stopping the spread of covid. Mind you, this is something that is<br>
 affecting our immune system, which is, to say the least, pretty fucking<br>
 important! The vaccine could cause AIDS by next year for all we know. <br>
(AIDS is a condition, not a disease, for those that don't know the <br>
difference.)</p>
<p>We're injecting ourselves with something untested, due to a panic that, <br>
in itself is hotly debated. We all remember the inflated death toll <br>
counter, that lacked correct data. The incentive offered by the <br>
government to hospitals that they then greedily abused by diagnosing <br>
every patient that died while having covid as a death caused BY covid. <br>
It's a political topic because every time something new comes up with <br>
covid, it OH SO CONVENIENTLY coincides with something major developing <br>
politically. If it were once or twice, I could chalk it up to <br>
coincidence. But it's happened a minimum of 8 times within the span of a<br>
 year and a half. This has superceded the realm of coincidence and I <br>
sincerely believe that covid is being used as a political ploy and tool,<br>
 and I suspect the democratic party of shady dealings with China.</p>

        <p>“My body my choice” isn’t some grand conspiracy.</p>
<p>I don’t need that shot, I don’t want it, fuck everyone who thinks I should be forced to take it.  I was almost killed by malpractice once, so now I don’t get medical procedures that I don’t need.</p>
