    <strong>The next phase of vaccinations is war by attrition.</strong>
    <p><p>It's already happening now but they will crank it up. Yes, you've heard the theories about people not being able to leave the country due to not having the shot. People being left out of stores, physical places, ect.</p>
<p>What I am speaking of is something different. It's using the vaccinated population and fostering resentment in them against people that don't want to take it.</p>
<p>Aren't people with "THE JAB" already being told that they still need to wear masks because they could be around someone who has not had it? Now apply this inconvenience to every facet of their life. Us PlAgUe RaTs will become a large scale inconvenience for them. You thought people going into stores without a mask was bad? I predict this reaction will be much, much worse.</p>
<p>Slowly boiling up inside, slowly cultivating a heinous brainwashed resentment for people like us... Why? Because "We could've been back to normal if you just would've taken the vaccine!".</p>
<p>I fear it will get bad. There is a friend I used to speak to that was vehemently against getting the shot... until, that is - not having it MINORLY inconvenienced him. He said "Yeah, they may make us get it if I want to play *Insert sport* again. If that's the case, of course I have to!".</p>
<p>No resistance, no critical thought process, no curiosity on the long term effects. Simply stated - I will resist until I really have to, and then I won't.  </p>
<p>If you feel like an outcast now, the pool of your people will become smaller and smaller. Less and less will be able to resist. </p></p>

        <p>I politely disagree. I think the next phase is the vaccinated being told they are infectious to both non-vaccinated and vaccinated alike, and with serious consequences for both if infected.</p>
<p>There's a plot twist coming here that nobody is seeing, but you can faintly hear the beginnings of it coming to the surface. People are quickly figuring out that being around vaccinated people has biological and psychological consequences that nobody can explain yet. Actually far quicker than I anticipated and this has been both mildly surprising and a flicker of hope that maybe people aren't as brain dead as we suppose.</p>
<p>It will be the VACCINATED that will become the pariahs is my guess. From there, all social hell will break loose!</p>

        <p>You might be half right - where that happens but instead of them becoming pariahs they still manage to make it our fault.</p>
<p>The divide is growing. I'm really beginning to hate these people for their ignorance (which is now affecting us directly) and willingness to push all of this on us. And they already hated us.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there's more of them than us.</p>
<p>But is that true? It could be that we are a silent majority...</p>

        <p>I would easily take your side with this, not even saying I’m disagreeing now, but I haven’t really read anything concrete to support this. Most of the posts about shedding spike proteins haven’t been substantiated.</p>

        <p>In my office of 20 people, 6 didn’t want the vaccine. The first day back in the office, and after being required to wear a n95 mask with a cloth mask, 4 of them caved and signed up for the vaccine. So now I’m 1 of 2.</p>

        <p>My Aunt received both doses of her vaccine by the beginning of January as she was a health care worker in SC. My Uncle was a Vietnam Veteran who had ischemic heart disease due to the effects of agent orange. My Auntie took him to the ER for low O2 sat the 3rd week in February where he was tested for Covid-19 which came back positive, he had no other symptoms, he was admitted to the hospital. 3 days later, my fully vaccinated Aunt tested positive for COVID-19 as well. Sadly, my Uncle was placed on a vent and passed away on March 10th. My Aunt had minimal symptoms and recovered fully but was not able to be with my Uncle as he passed due to Covid protocol. About a week later another Uncle of mine suddenly passed away 2 weeks after receiving his 2nd vaccination, he collapsed and died at work. Most people believe the vaccinations prevent you from contracting Covid, while it was only meant to minimize symptoms and hospitalizations, it is unapproved for use by the FDA, vaccination paper work states this as fact, as well it only has an emergency use authorization and may aid in the prevention of Covid-19. I stated all of this in another forum and was told it should be taken down because it was misinformation, it’s all facts, I was also rendered uneducated, I’m retired from the medical field. I’m not taking an unapproved experimental anything.</p>

        <p>I agree with this... here's what i worry about...what happens if the vaxx actually DOES have remotely activated nano-technology on top of that. Are we literally going to see mobs of remote controlled zombies after the vaxx survivor army is all setup...i imagine governments / militaries commanding and controlling legions of angry/violent vaccinated chads and karens at will, like a literal walking dead, as their soul consciousness will be back burnered and their bodies taken over like hosts, for even more bad stuff potentially. The human bodies of vaxxers will surely be part machine part human (that is the essence of this DNA alteration, to bring about this transhumanism agenda), and why many people won't survive the "upgrade"--most people aren't healthy enough to go through such mind-body-fuckery--too much sugar and processed foods. I just imagine--for those who do survive the vax, they could end up as the real-life Walking Dead to take out the rest of us who had woken up and knew what would happen. Is there something we can do? I also haven't ruled out the possibility that I'm actually insane. Thanks for posting!</p>
