    <strong>I'm a carer and no I'm not getting the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>months ago I got a letter inviting me to get a vaccine, I ignored it and then a few weeks ago I received a second letter reminding me to get a vaccine, the second letter had a slightly more urgent tone to it.</p>
<p>Things I don't like:</p>
<p>the attitude of these letters, they only discussed ways of booking an appointment, there was a small amount of the letter covering people who are ineligible, such as pregnant women, but nothing to reassure normal people who dont want the vaccine because of their own free will.</p>
<p>secondly I feel like as a carer for boomers, Im only valued as a tool to help the economy milk more high end pension money out of the boomers I provide care for.</p>
<p>I'm not anti-vax, if people want a vaccine, go ahead be my guest and go and get it.</p>
<p>"but what about people at risk?"</p>
<p>errr... shouldn't 'at risk' people already have taken the vaccine? </p>
<p>in the UK them pesky at risk types have been at the front of the vaccine queue since the start, I've taken the two family members I care for their vaccines. im not against vaccines.</p>
<p>"its not fair, I've waited x-number of weeks for my vaccine, and you have been offered it twice!"</p>
<p>yeah... heheheh. go fuck yourself.</p>
<p>but seriously, i'm humbly getting out of the way so you have one less person in front of you in the queue, isnt that a great thing?</p>
<p>"aren't you worried about the 'rona?"</p>
<p>nope. (I'm not overweight and we do a lot of exercise.) besides if I drop dead its not like i'm working on a cure for cancer or something else important.</p>
<p>"so why dont you want it?"</p>
<p>cause the government is telling me I need it with no choice.</p>
<p>and its hilarious to think i'm witnessing 'rona fucking up the global economy, capitalism is  has been destroying the biosphere unopposed for centuries, and now the biosphere is fighting back.</p>
<p>sidenote, my parents worked in the medical industry, and before the MMR vaccine scandal hysteria of the 90s, in the mid 80s they decided me and my siblings wont have vaccine which was the equivalent of the MMR at that time. so I've had mumps etc. anyway,a few years ago my old man explained that a GP he worked with explained about a child in his practice who had a severe reaction to that particular vaccine developed some sort meningitis and was left disabled. </p>
<p>however last time I took my old man to the GP surgery for his second jab, they said while making conversation with the staff/volunteers 'ohh he's my carer and he doesn't want the vaccine. he thinks he knows more than the medical professionals!' etc etc that fucking pissed me off, considering now days when I ask him why I never got vaccinated he doesn't even have the slightest memory also he doesn't even remember me having the mumps. hahah.</p></p>

        <p>I don't know which vax ruined my cousin's life, but it happened in the 80s, when she was an infant. She went into seizures and stopped breathing long enough to be permanently brain damaged. It was ruled a vaccine injury and her family received a huge sum. But she had zero quality of life and died in her 20s. I asked my other cousin if he'd vaccinate his kids and he said "oh she had a rare, one in a million reaction, so yeah I would vaccinate and you should to". I didn't until I was basically forced to for kindergarten. I was too scarred from memories of seeing my cousin at family gatherings. Thankfully waiting til kindergarten meant he only needed a fraction of the vaccines and he was totally fine, just like I was. </p>
<p>Later, one of my dogs got some form of meningitis right after a rabies booster. It cost thousands of dollars to treat and I almost put her down. Now none of my animals get any boosters.</p>
