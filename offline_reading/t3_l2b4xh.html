    <strong>How is the death toll still increasing after 5 million people have been vaccinated?</strong>
    <p><p>Something that's really really baffling me is the fact that there are only 2 million people on the NHS records that are classed as 'vulnerable'. There are also only 1.5 million NHS workers (not front line staff). The government claimed they've vaccinated 5 million peolle so far which surely means all the vulnerable people &amp; all the NHS staff &amp; all of the 80 &amp; there are only 3.2 million people 80+ which surely means that there are only around a couple more million people that need to be vaccinated before everything goes back to normal? The government claim they vaccinate at least 2 million a week so let's say 4 more weeks of lockdowns and everything should be back to normal? I just don't understand why they're not announcing anything.</p></p>

        <p>I agree, but you're not allowed to say that, because it's hateful to suggest that 95% of people shouldn't be held back for the sake of 5% - even though they can make necessary life adjustments to avoid getting sick easier than the 95%.</p>

        <p>This is the most obvious answer. Unfortunately vaccines are essentially an unquestionable religion so even the idea that they MIGHT be ineffective is simply blasphemy!</p>

        <p>The vaccine takes time to work. Typically 14 days after the second dose. The interval between the 1st and 2nd doses are 21 days. Assuming no issues with supply chain, you expect people to have immunity 35 days after first dose of the vaccine.</p>

        <p>But do we really know the vaccine works? Medicines typically take years of testing and reconfiguring the formula. This vaccine was rushed out and we don't know the long term effects. We don't even really know what's in the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I think most people think this vaccine is rushed because they don’t know that the US has been working on SARS/MERS vaccines since SARS ( Cov-1) came out.  Both SARS and MERS are far deadlier ( MERS has a 40% fatality rate and lives in the wild in camels.). </p>
<p>As a country that involves itself heavily on the Middle East, there has been lots of money spent developing a vaccine for it. MERS and COVID come from the same family of viruses so much of the baseline animal studies on this vaccine For this type of virus were already begun in 2002 when SARS-1 appeared.  When MERS came out and the military realized how significantly it could effect readiness, even more money was poured into the effort. In fact the military has a vaccine for MERS that it is already trialing. </p>

<p>So this vaccine may seem very rushed, but the basics have been researched for almost two decades.</p>
