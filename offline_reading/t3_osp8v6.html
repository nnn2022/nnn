    <strong>How can I find out if my food is vaccinated or not?? I'M STARVING!!</strong>
    <p><p>Alright so you might think I'm being a bit overly cautious here but there <em>have</em> been reports in the past of cats and dogs getting Covid, and as we know the virus originated from bat-soup (NOT a lab, don't be silly!), so I think it's fair to conclude that even though I'm fully jabbed and haven't left the house in over a year I could still catch Covid from eating meat. I couldn't find out if animals had been vaccinated against Covid-19 yet so I decided to become vegan.</p>
<p>Did I mention that I'm vegan? Well, I am. Deal with it.</p>
<p>Problem is though vegan food is expensive and my furlough money has mostly gone towards keeping myself subscribed to streaming services and OnlyFans. Also, I get all my food delivered and this was fine when we were all unvaccinated and wearing masks but now everyone's just pretending to be vaccinated and has taken their masks off! This has made me extremely nervous and paranoid around any delivery driver that comes to my house now, and even though they SAY they're vaccinated, I don't believe them.</p>
<p>It's now day... five without food? Six? I've honestly lost count. Anyway you get the picture: I'm not eating as I literally can't afford it mentally or financially. I now have the physique of Christian Bale in The Machinist. I am rotting away and the hunger is driving me slightly insane. I even thought about leaving the house the other day to forage for berries in my back garden!! I need help but my therapist says (we chat over Zoom) I am behaving perfectly normal and rationally for someone living through a deadly pandemic.</p>
<p>I'm getting desperate here. How desperate, you ask? Well, my question in the title was originally going to be "can cannibals still be considered vegan if they only eat themselves?" but I talked myself out of that one. My fingers do look tasty though...</p></p>

        <p>The only way to be sure your food is safe is for you to put it in an oven and bake it at 400 degrees until it's a solid black block of charcoal. Only then will it be safe.</p>

        <p>Brother, It saddens me to see you in such a painful position.</p>
<p>I have discussed with a well versed preacher of the church, and we concluded you need to strengthen up fast. The only solution is for you to start eating lots of meat, vaccinated meat... human meat!</p>
<p>It is the only solution, and you have to live, you are too important to the cause! (You!) Obviously it wouldn't make any sense to eat an old person, they have suffered enough after having lived a nice long life with cheap housing + 1.5 year extra time lifesupport covid extension. We cannot throw all those investments away. No, you will have to find the youngest most virginist soul around, make sure the little human creature is fully vaccinated and then feast on it! The preacher mentioned to first bring the child to him to do a proper checkup of the vaccination status.</p>
<p>Go forth and make haste! Your life, which is more important than a younger life, depends on it!</p>

        <p>It's a well known fact of The $cience that food isn't safe.</p>
<p>Simply consume all of the pharmacutical industry products that are fully FDA approved and have a long track record of being safe and then, and ONLY then, you'll be fine.</p>
