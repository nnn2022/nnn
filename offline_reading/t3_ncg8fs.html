<title>My(16M) Girlfriend(15F) is being forced to take a Pfizer covid vaccine by her parents this Tuesday. I’d like to start a discussion with them about giving her the choice to opt out, but I was wondering if I could have some input on how to do that productively?</title>

<p>I’m a little nervous, but I’m really hoping that they won’t get upset if I present it respectfully. We’re on good terms, they really like me and I don’t see how this would damage that.</p>

        <p>well that's great you've got a good relationship. Come in respectfully, and I guess my advice would be.  </p>
<p>Spend a minute or two highlighting the values / container of the conversation up "it's a contentious issue, I'm afraid of upsetting you and loosing favour with you, and I feel a really strong need to have this conversation with you, would it be possible for me to present my case?"  </p>
<p>Basically setting the conversationl frame up a bit, can help with the delivery. Good luck! You legend</p>

        <p>You need to have a list of resources for them to look through. They probably won’t appreciate spouting off and it’s easy for these kinds of people to lose focus even when they have sources to look at.. so if just compile a list of sources. You can include info from the cdc website.. here it says in plain ink that the vaccine isn’t actually fully proven to stop transmission etc. </p>

        <p>I have to respectfully submit that when a woman has reached or passed menopause,  including surgical menopause, her menstrual cycles have ended. Thus, there is no cycle for a vaccine to disrupt. Further, once menopause is complete, a woman is no longer fertile anyway. Not saying that the vaccine isn't problematic for many reasons... but I don't think that menstrual disruption and infertility in a post-menopausal or surgically "menopaused" woman should be on there.</p>

        <p>I think you have a strong list here.  Make sure you have documentation to cite so you aren't perceived to make "baseless assertions".  You have an uphill battle ahead of you because the people you are dealing with have been completely misinformed to the point they are completely uninformed while believing they are more informed than you, if that makes sense.  I would also focus on #5 and show them how miniscule of risk your GF faces if healthy and taking a multivitamin.   If they retort with "well, we want her to be vaccinated to help protect us" then you can pull out the multitude of cases of fully vaccinated people testing positive for covid - (Mill Maher, NY Yankees, etc).  Good luck and God bless you.</p>

        <p>Hi, you can find my most comprehensive write up on the vaccines here: </p>
<p>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IRhm1k1ctgd_iTBRkUFPNpfcHt3ZMFmHUaS47BzVXeQ/edit</p>
<p>Maybe the rhetoric is too alarmist or not applicable to your situation, but the sources should be useful.</p>
<p>Also, you say she will be "forced." How are they going to do this? Are they going to hold her down and shove it in her arm? Are they going to have the cops escort her there? They can't force her to do shit. What are they gonna do ground her?</p>
<p>If it comes to it, I would encourage you guys to "get away" for a few days, maybe she can stay with a sympathetic relative for a minute. But DO NOT let them coerce you. This isn't a math test where the wrong answer is -2 points, this is your life.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I appreciate it! I’ll definitely look at the sources in there:) I think that if I just show her that it’s actually risky and not just a “Karen anti vaxxer sentiment” that shell let my GF opt out.</p>
<p>As far as forcing her, they would drag her to the vaccine clinic, take away all her privileges, etc. No nurse is going to hold a 15 year old girl down.
 I’ll update this post later today and let y’all know how it went! My plan B is just having her tell the nurse no.</p>

        <p>It really depends on the personality of her parents, if it were my GF I would bring a very thick file of printouts showing that more people have died from the COVID vax than ALL OTHER VACCINES COMBINED in the past 30 years, I would bring stats from the CDC themselves saying that only 6% of deaths were actually attributed to covid, the rest were co-morbidities, and that hospitals were paid up to $30,000 PER CASE via the CARES Act to list causes of death as COVID insead of whatever they actually died from, and that the survivability rate is 99.99% unless you're over 70 years old. You could also bring stats that show the common cold has completely vanished for the first time in 100 years (down 90+%) and that the inventor of the PCR test themself says that PCR test give 90% false positives. That should be a pretty good starting point.</p>

        <p>I can't seem to find it atm, but look at the Texas senate hearings, there is one about your age group &amp; just about the best argument that can be made... There's simply no safety data, none, the clinical trials didn't include teenagers.</p>

        <p>Unless you want to lose your gf, STAY OUT of the discussion, completely.  Help your gf prepare herself (with info and exactly what her argument will be, etc.) but she will have to have the confrontation ALONE.  </p>

        <p>That’s all great stuff, but honestly I’d keep it quick and simple. They don’t need a research essay and I’d doubt they’d have the patience for it. I would mention how low of a chance she could die from covid and how the average comorbidity deaths is 4. Then I’d mention the known and unknown risks of the vaccines as you’ve pointed out. Just tell them that you’re worried the risk of getting the vaccine greatly outweighs the risk of her not getting the vaccine. Also, show common ground by saying it is cause you care about their daughter and you’re worried this particular vaccine may put her at unnecessary risk.</p>

I reuploaded your file in an anonaddy link for you:)

        <p>No problem! Thank you for your help, it means a lot to me and my gf! Unfortunately, they wouldn't hear either of us out and think we're crazy. The way I understand their explanation, they're scared of getting covid from my gf(despite them having the shots), and they're not not willing to entertain the possibility that there are some risks associated with the vaccine. They brushed it off as "she'll be fine" and claimed that we're lucky to have such an opportunity to get the vaccine.</p>
