    <strong>This crap is nuts</strong>
    <p><p>I hate the news, I hate Dr.Fauci , I hate these Politician’s, I hate the morons who believe covid is as dangerous as it seems. I would like to go into a room with someone severely infected with covid let’s bet money I don’t catch covid. “100 deaths per hour.” I mean c’mon now it seems they are counting regular deaths now. Can’t I just smash this television and NO this vaccine won’t bring us back to normal and NO this vaccine is not safe. This may seem evil but I hope someone goes into the WHO board room and kills Dr. Tedros, Dr. Redfield, Bill Gates, Dr.Fauci and all the other evil people. All our problems would be solved and prayers would be answered. Imagine how fast people would rip off their masks. I want to scream in the streets butt-ass naked I can’t take this anymore.</p></p>

        <p>Just take a media break and ignore the idiots in person if you can.  Turn off the TV, don’t go on Facebook/reddit.  Do what you want to do.  It really is that simple.   And realize only about 20% of people can actually think for themselves.</p>

        <p>Me, my family, and all my friends have had covid and most of us didn’t even know we had it but were required to get tested for work. It kills people, but generally people that already had one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel. People are losing their minds and virtue signaling and all kinds of ridiculous crap</p>

        <p>My mother would care to disagree with that if she was still alive. She was very healthy (stated by her primary care physician) and this thing killed her.</p>
<p>Yes, she was 69 years old but she was just getting into the best years of her life.</p>
<p>Dad was a different story. He had pages of pre-ex's and was a transplant patient so him getting CoVid-19 while in rehab for recovery from his CAB and the JHH doctors overdosing him on his tacrolimus 3 times was basically a death sentence.</p>
