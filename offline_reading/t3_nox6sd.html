    <strong>Anyone remember early on the Covid-19 pandemic on the Diamond Princess cruise ship?</strong>
    <p><p>I think most people agree that a cruise ship is a better than average place for a respiratory virus to spread.  Well, <em>this</em> cruise lasted from January 20th, 2020 to February 5th, 2020.  And we know the virus was on board because ~ 20% of the people on board tested positive.  Of those people, 14 died.  Of those 14 people, none were less than 60 years of age, 4 of them were in their 80s, and five of them were in their 70s.  So less than one half of one per cent of the people onboard that cruise ship died, when the virus was likely at its most virulent, and those that succumbed were mostly elderly.  I can't find information on the prior health conditions of those people; perhaps someone else can find it.  But anyway, those numbers, small and relatively nonthreatening as they are, are much larger than what we have found in the year since then.  And yet we are forcing children to wear masks while they are outside, playing, and there are people who think that's a good idea.  I disagree.</p></p>

        <p>And you have to remember medical care would have been limited compared to an actual hospital.  So, those deaths were in the absence of ICU level care.</p>

        <p>We have to also remember that nursing homes in 5 States were forced to accept C-19 patients.  And that people testing positive were put on ventilators too readily.</p>
<p>So many things were done wrong, and yet more than 99.9% of us have survived.  And numbskulls are walking around wearing two masks while they are outside.  What the hell is going on?</p>

        <p>True, the vents turned out to be a huge mistake.  I was only staring that with proper medical care even fewer people on the ship would have died.  The vast majority of people have a higher chance of getting struck by lightning than dying of Covid.</p>

        <p>The very fact that this cruise ship incident was paraded all over the msm shouts at me that the whole situation was contrived and manufactured. It was one of the early jumping man incidents (9 11 reference) as I like to call them. </p>
<p>Let's assume that the cruise company actually exists, although I have not checked it. Even then, if you knew the pandemic was coming, which let's face facts here, a great many people seemed to be predicting it and  creating various patents and exchanging large ppe contracts and the like, how difficult would it be to place a couple of dozen operatives in place.</p>
<p>When things appear to get bad, send in the 'doctor' and claim that some of the olds have died. Did you see the dead, did we background check the dead? Did anyone see their social media profiles, funnels, friends? </p>
<p>I think we need to be careful with these kind of events that the media are so intrinsically connected with. To use this incident as a basis for meaningful discussion on cerveza sickness is folly.</p>

        <p>I agree this would be easy to pull off. Especially a restricted area where no one can come in or out. It would be easy. After seeing some of the other things that were accomplished by the deep state lately, I don't doubt it for a second. Epstein and the election made me realize these people are more powerful than even I thought.</p>

        <p>I do remember this.  The other interesting piece of this is that the average age on the cruise ship was quite a bit higher than the general population.  We couldn't even get to a 3 percent mortality rate on a floating petri dish, but somehow we could have a computer shit out a model that claimed it.</p>

        <p>And they based the original London Imperial College Report on that level of infection and death rate as well.  So back and read the original paper, and see the footnotes of your original mess.  It is all based off an assumption about transmission rates which they got from the Diamond Princess Boat Cruise.</p>
