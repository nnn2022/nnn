        <p>I started thinking about this in the context of some conspiracy videos by the verbal gambit on yt. His material is quite eye opening with old and new images and video of famous historical monuments showing bits flaking off to reveal concrete and metal reinforcement beneath. Bricks where there should be marble etc. He also points out some remarkable things about prosthetic masks and celebrities, body prosthetics etc which show us that what we see is often not a true representation of reality.</p>
<p>Does anyone actually know anyone personally that has been in redist quarantine. One of my bros twitter contacts just went to Spain for a few days, which is Amber. No pcr on way out just got on plane with disability lanyard and didn't even mask up on the plane. Not sure what her return journey was like but seemed a lot less bother than media is portraying.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am just a little sceptical of this video now because it could easily represent controlled fear porn. It might not but critical thought is always better than blind acceptance.</p>
