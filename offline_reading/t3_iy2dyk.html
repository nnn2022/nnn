    <strong>What should be done to not take this out on retail workers?</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone! I guess I have a question that is a discussion. We have never worn masks at work (small independent shop), a dozen guys, two tested positive for covid months ago, never showed symptoms but quarantined anyway, nothing since. I don't wear one at work, but I do wear one when I go to a retail store that has employees wearing them. I go to a lot of auto parts places that have a "must wear mask" sign on the door and nobody, including the employees, is wearing one. Then I go to other places (mostly restaurants) and they are SUPER strict about making sure you have your mask on the second you stand up. They say it's the governor's orders and they can get shut down if they don't enforce it. What do we do about these types? I don't want to make life hard for some retail worker, whether at a restaurant or store, but I think we all know the masks are useless at this stage. I don't want to put them in an awkward spot, but this is my only objection to not wearing a mask in some of these places. Any thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>They need a sign on the door. They will get in trouble if their employees aren’t wearing them.</p>
<p>Haven’t heard of a single place getting shut down or in trouble for customers not complying. Have you?</p>
<p>You can walk in the door wearing one and take it off once in the store, or see if they care if your walk in without one. </p>
<p>People act like you’re either wearing a mask OR just destroying the soul and dignity of retail workers. Fallacy of false dilemma.</p>
<p>If they request you put one on, say you don’t wear them for medical reasons and ask them directly and kindly if they want you to leave. If they yes, then do. They won’t be crying into their pillow at night over that interaction. </p>
<p>Here’s the thing though: even that route takes guts. And it’s easier for a lot of people to just tell themselves it would be abusive to retail workers to do this. It’s not true but many people are using that absolve themselves from having to do something brave.</p>

        <p>Nice job advising someone to use medical excuse even if it's not true. Makes it even harder to believe that people with no mask on actually have a problem. </p>
<p>Why is it such a problem to wear one IF there is a slight chance if helps?</p>

        <p>Thanks! I thought it was a nice job, too!</p>
<p>If there’s a slight chance it helps, then YOU should wear one. And then you’ll definitely 100% get into heaven. No doubt about it. </p>
<p>It shouldn’t be the law. That a law is easy to follow doesn’t make it sound or fair.</p>

        <p>It’s dehumanizing. It covers your identity and anonymizes you. It makes it difficult to speak AND hear. And Jesus Christ is this where we are now? That we all need to be <em>obligated</em> to do something just because it’s not hard, and because it MAY help SLIGHTLY? You sound insane.</p>
<p>I’m sure MANY people have told women in oppressive Middle East counties, hey! Wear the burqa, is it hard? No, it’s not hard, it takes 2 seconds to put on. So what is the problem, here?</p>

        <p>It’s also “Easy” to, say, stay in your house for 2 years. You don’t have to lift a finger. It’s easy to stay in prison for 2 years - your meals are provided! It’s easy to eat canned beans for all three meals a day - no cooking! </p>
<p>What the fuck does ease have to do with whether someone should be legally required of HEALTHY, free people? That’s the metric for whether something should be criminalized.</p>

        <p>I would say that there is plenty of scientific proof that masks reduce the possibility of the virus spread and the virus is known to killing people / giving unstudied and unexplained long term damage to the body, and there is no very efficient treatment identified yet....therefore the speaking/hearing concern should be secondary and people should wear a mask to save lives, and not put medical employees under unnecessary risk. </p>
<p>But .... You most likey are either in denial of these scientific facts or not caring about anyone other than yourself.... hence to you it's just a piece of facial cover someone is forcing on you.</p>

        <p>Like I said, you’re definitely going to heaven. </p>
<p>Go out and don it, bro. Get off here and go mask up and walk around. You’re so so good, and you’re so so selfless. The science is murky at BEST, about masks, that’s why some countries don’t require them. </p>
<p>But you’re so good (I mean really: SO, so good - imagine me patting you on the head right now like a good boy or girl) that even murky data that doesn’t show causation is enough for you to mask up every time. </p>
<p>You’re going to love heaven, I bet. I heard it’s choice.</p>

        <p>And I bet when this is over you’re going to keep covering your face (it’s okay to be dehumanized and not seen, because that’s how VIRTUOUS you are) forever, because while there is a flu “season”, it circulates the whole year. And there is at least 1 day of asymptomatic contagiousness with the flu. Which means masking - well; it MAY work... it may “stop a droplet or 2” like Fauci said, so it MAY work and thus if you wear it every day for the rest of your life, you could probably “save” a dozen or so old, frail people (who will - because you masked up - now live <em>literally forever</em>. They will go from being near death already to being INVINCIBLE) who you may have otherwise spread to the flu to. And the flu does not have a cure or good treatment. So like, it’s basically a MUST at this point. Just one like; man! Just one life makes it worth it. </p>

        <p>Holy cow. Are you joking?</p>
<p>It’s no wonder you get upset when you see people practicing their right to not wear a mask - you’ve made so many harsh, severe, unnecessary sacrifices. That would mess with my head, too!</p>
<p>How long do you plan on locking yourself away from the world? Would you do it as long as five years, if the news told you to?</p>
<p>Do you realize that every day you lock yourself away and refuse to be out there living; you are absolutely, no matter what, one day closer to the grave? Every day you’re closer to dying than the day before. You cannot escape that. Time on earth is linear, you only go one direction. </p>
<p>Jeez I was just giving you a hard time before now I really hope there IS a mask-wearers heaven. Because you’re wasting your mortal life here on earth, encased in fear. Keeping you in my thoughts.</p>

        <p>I actually do not sacrifice much other than not going to a bar or flying for a vacation abroad. I still see friends socially distanced, work from home, I am ok ordering groceries online, and I enjoy time with my family and explore the outdoors. There is not much I would do differently and to me it's worth not risking my health or health of others if I end up being a virus carrier. </p>
<p>I feel like there is progress already made in vaccines and treatments so I will stay in quarantine until R0 is low enough, I doubt it will take more than another year, so that's the plan for now.</p>

        <p>Jesus, I’m so glad to hear that you’ve let friends come anywhere near you (you know they’ve confirmed aerosol spread and that 6’ isn’t nearly enough distanced right?). Have you been touched by another human since March? Besides a doctor? Have you been hugged? Kissed? Anything?</p>

        <p>You do the same thing I always did when I was out for a beer and my buddy went outside to smoke and I brought my beer with me to sip on while he smoked. Server comes around yelling about how they could lose their liquor license, I say not my problem, if she tells me pay my bill and leave I do so and leave her zero tip and tell her the reason why. I also deposit and upper decker in the toilet tank or if I don't need to make dooky I piss on the floor. I've been banned from a few places but to me it's worth it.</p>
