    <strong>It's Easy to Forget...</strong>
    <p><p>...that the Nazis, the Soviets, and the Communist Chinese all had tons of scientists, engineers, and medical doctors within their ranks.  Virtually all the enormous crimes committed by those regimes were planned, sanctioned, and executed with the help of scientists, engineers, and medical doctors.  And it's not like those regimes were scrapping the bottom of the barrel and recruiting second rate technicians.  Many of them came straight from the most prestigious universities and research centers in their respective societies.  And all of them thought they were doing the right thing, and that their actions were supported by "the science".</p></p>

        <p>They had scientists like Lysenko, with completely wrong botanical theories that caused millions of deaths and unmeasurable suffering, and set back his country for decades.     </p>
<p>And the scientists contradicting his bullshit were ostracized if they were lucky, or sent to gulags or mental asylums if unlucky.      </p>
<p>And then Mao would take again his dumb pseudoscience two decades later, for the same result.      </p>

<p>also.. why all the blind faith in science these days? just because they can produce some gadgets and abuse some mechanics of the Universe to produce something that works doesn't mean they figured it all out... especially since half of science is built on false pre assumptions about the nature of our world since everyone is just projecting what they want the world to be instead of looking at it for what it truly is.   </p>
<p>We can take a scientific dogma like "survival of the fittest". It does hold some merit, but it is essentially wrong.   </p>
<p>There are shitload of examples in nature where the "fittest" doesn't mean shit. How many apex predators died out through history? Shitloads. And yet things like Sloths remain lol. Ofc "fittest" is open to interpretation, but its just an theory that justifies eugenics ideology. Thats why it was so encouraged by the elite, its not like the Darwin was the first guy ever to think of that lol.   </p>
<p>Next, lets take the serotonin hypothesis.   </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1277931/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1277931/</a>  </p>
<p>Its been proven wrong. Since 2005 at least. And yet, we are still operating under "serotonin influences depression" paradigm. If that was the case, literally eating shitload of l-tryptamine (natural precursor to serotonin) would cure all depression. Which is not the case, as mental problems are not caused by "wrong brain chemistry". Why? Because THERE IS NO BASELINE BRAIN CHEMISTRY lol. There are no standardized ratios of brain hormones that would define a "normal mind" or brain.   </p>
<p>Also, half the usable science today about human anatomy and body came from those cruel pseudo science experiments those regimes of the past preformed. Yes, they did them with the different intention, to prove other shit, but during those they found out about many medicinal aspects of human body modern medicine today uses.   </p>
<p>From morphine to god knows what else.   </p>
<p>" with completely wrong botanical theories that caused millions of deaths and unmeasurable suffering, and set back his country for decades. "  </p>
<p>And yet we are basing our entire world on a bunch of bullshit economic made up theories that literally cause all the worlds suffering because some psychopaths running the world have a power trip and like to play god with the world economy not giving a fuck how it influences the outcome of millions of people?   </p>
<p>You guys don't get it at all... you cannot have if it wasn't taken away from someone. Only reason we have "advanced western world" is because it was built on pain and suffering of countless indigenous, native and other people of 3rd and 4th world countries who weren't able to defend themselves against imperial powers that came and took what they deemed theirs.   </p>
<p>You think you would have cheap ass electronics and your precious standard of living unless the capitalist system wasn't exploiting the people from where the materials are actually coming from?   </p>
<p>Gheez.   </p>
<p>Also get the fuck outta here with that "us vs them" moral highground bullshit... we are all humans and we are all full of shit equally. If you can't acknowledge that, you are definitely full of shit.   </p>
<p>Oh wow, mao killed his people because of locus. <br>
Dude, our system modified wheat so it could feed the world and literally ended up sickening the entire fucking world with this carbohydrates bullshit, its everywhere in everything and its literally the last thing we as a species were designed to eat since until we modified it wheat was shit and we barely ate it since it had such small yields and nutritional value. Wow we solved world hunger by creating a bunch of sickly people that have shitload of "unknown ailments" that pretty much all stem from sedetary lifestyle and eating too much carbs since our body is not designed to operate on carbs. It also fucks up your gut biome which fucks up your entire body. But yea, lets feel good about ourselves because people are not dying.  </p>
<p>Also, what is it with all this saving people moral highground bullshit?  </p>
<p>Arent you advising science?<br>
Well survival of the fittest is the benchmark idea of evolutionary science.   </p>
<p>Why are you then trying to say that killing those unfit to provide enough to eat is wrong?<br>
You are literally using science to defy a scientific principle. Oh look people are dying because the world deemed them unfit, better save all of them so they can continue to breed and life... unfit to live?   </p>
<p>What type of psychosis is that? Self or society induced? lol</p>

<p>Blind faith in science isn't good, for sure, but there is definitely a need for deferring to experts. If you need someone to come and fix your furnace, you're probably going to have faith that they know what they're doing. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;especially since half of science is built on false pre assumptions about the nature of our world since everyone is just projecting what they want the world to be instead of looking at it for what it truly is</p>
<p>A lot of faff that doesn't speak to any understanding about science at all. </p>
<p>\&rt; There are shitload of examples in nature where the "fittest" doesn't mean shit. How many apex predators died out through history? Shitloads. And yet things like Sloths remain lol. </p>
<p>Fundamentally, fitness is defined only as meeting the criteria needed to survive the individual's environmental conditions. A sloth would fare very poorly in the desert. It thrives in jungles where food is plentiful, and being high up is generally a good defense strategy. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, apex predators fail when they can't find food to catch and eat. They are unfit if they can't meet that condition, no matter how you bend the definition toward "physically fit humans." What you think fit means is simply not what fit means.</p>
<p>\&rt;  but its just an theory that justifies eugenics ideology. </p>
<p>It's a theory with massive amounts of evidential backing. Eugenics is a completely separate, massively misguided ideology that is built on the very misunderstanding of fitness that you are putting on display. </p>
<p>\&rt; half the usable science today about human anatomy and body came from those cruel pseudo science experiments those regimes of the past preformed </p>
<p>Uhhh, citation really fucking essential here. You don't see a lot of callback to Nazi/Japanese/what-have-you evidence. Much of it was useless because the scientists conducting the experiments were completely incompetent.</p>
<p>\&rt; From morphine to god knows what else.</p>
<p>This is a case in point. Morphine predates the regimes you're alluding to. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You make a few good points about the morality of people trying to take the high ground. But your understanding of the science is woefully underdeveloped.</p>

Thats why it was so encouraged by the elite, its not like the Darwin was the first guy ever to think of that lol.</p>
<p>I typed a lovely little essay for you but it got deleted when I tried to quote something else :(</p>
<p>Long story short, you are misunderstanding the idea of fitness. In population genetics and evolution theory, fitness is a measurement of reproductive success. "Survival of the fittest" is circular in that it's really saying "survival of the species depends on reproductive success" which is pretty common sense. And not nearly as catchy. But, by definition, the 'apex predators' that died out were literally unfit. Fitness is not open to interpretation except by laypeople, and it absolutely does not support eugenics. In fact, fitness dictates a necessity of a wide gene pool and variance in genetic frequencies in order to maintain a healthy population - otherwise, the accumulation of lethal genes and the inbreeding coefficients get too high for the survival of the species. This is the common problem for people trying to prevent the extinction of extremely endangered species, currently. </p>
<p>&rt;Its been proven wrong. Since 2005 at least. And yet, we are still operating under "serotonin influences depression" paradigm. If that was the case, literally eating shitload of l-tryptamine (natural precursor to serotonin) would cure all depression. Which is not the case, as mental problems are not caused by "wrong brain chemistry". Why? Because THERE IS NO BASELINE BRAIN CHEMISTRY lol. There are no standardized ratios of brain hormones that would define a "normal mind" or brain. </p>
<p>I'm not sure who the "we" is here; people are still trying to figure out the cause of depression, and if the biochemical results are causative or correlative. It is a continually growing field that includes multiple disciplines such as biochemistry, psychology, genetics, and biology. As far as I have seen and understand, there are correlative, at least, tendencies between serotonin and depression. According to this 2015 study here, that (kind of) seems to be what you're saying - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471964/#:~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cserotonin%20hypothesis%E2%80%9D%20of%20clinical,in%20the%20pathophysiology%20of%20depression">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4471964/#:\~:text=The%20%E2%80%9Cserotonin%20hypothesis%E2%80%9D%20of%20clinical,in%20the%20pathophysiology%20of%20depression</a>. - there is still significant clinical impact of SSRIs in which serotonin may play a role. </p>
<p>In summary, we don't know yet. Working theories happen all the time in science, especially in fields where we are not operating under concrete laws yet (think chemistry before the 1900s). There is almost certainly baseline brain chemistry for individuals, and there are likely trends either due to genotype or environment that impact the likelihood of mental disorders that science is currently determining with what comparatively little data we can (considering human testing is unethical). </p>
<p>&rt;Also, half the usable science today about human anatomy and body came from those cruel pseudo science experiments those regimes of the past preformed.</p>
<p>Not nearly... Yes, there is some information we learned from cruel experiments, but the majority of modern advances have definitely not been from them, unless you think that using human cells in any form is morally wrong and cruel, in which case that becomes an opinion and not really arguable. Kind of a weird take though.</p>
<p>&rt;Dude, our system modified wheat so it could feed the world and literally ended up sickening the entire fucking world with this carbohydrates bullshit, its everywhere in everything and its literally the last thing we as a species were designed to eat since until we modified it wheat was shit and we barely ate it since it had such small yields and nutritional value.

It also fucks up your gut biome which fucks up your entire body. But yea, lets feel good about ourselves because people are not dying.</p>
<p>We absolutely are supposed to operate on carbohydrates. Literally. Carbohydrates are complex sugars, which are the basis of our metabolism (energy processing). Once broken down into glucose/fructose/other sugar, our body metabolizes them to generate ATP through both glycolysis and the Krebs cycle which are the main energy source (mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell!). I do not want to mock ignorance, but please do not claim that carbohydrates in moderation cause disease. That's just not true.</p>
<p>&rt; Why are you then trying to say that killing those unfit to provide enough to eat is wrong?<br>
You are literally using science to defy a scientific principle. Oh look people are dying because the world deemed them unfit, better save all of them so they can continue to breed and life... unfit to live? </p>
<p>I have no idea where the first poster said anything about killing people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I understand there's a lot of confusion in the world right now, and a lot of misinformation. If you want help understanding some of the other terms being thrown around recklessly and/or are commonly misunderstood (such as 'fitness' and 'carbohydrates'), feel free to reach out.</p>

        <p>Nice user name. I'm tempted to go out now. </p>
<p>But your point is misinformed. I don't think anyone who is anti-lockdown is a bootlicker. Rather, the people who played ball with Trump's more insane propositions (if I need to recount them, then there's no point to this conversation) were elevated in the response team. </p>
<p>If you talked about caution on hydroxychloroquine (which doesn't work, we've since found out), you were pushed down the ladder.</p>
<p>If you talked about precautions like mask mandates and lockdowns, you were pushed down the ladder.</p>
<p>If you disagreed with the messaging on the severity of the disease, you were pushed down the ladder. </p>
<p>In essence, if you agreed with Trump (a person with no tentative grasp on almost anything disease related), you were golden. If you disagreed publicly, you got your career rocked, no matter your reputation or standing in the scientific community.</p>

        <p>&rt; If you talked about precautions like mask mandates and lockdowns, you were pushed down the ladder.</p>
<p>Fucking GOOD. Lockdowns and mask mandates are not supported by any real-world evidence and they're an extreme expansion of government power into our daily lives and personal autonomy.</p>
<p>&rt; If you disagreed with the messaging on the severity of the disease, you were pushed down the ladder.</p>
<p>Again, fucking GOOD. The severity of this illness has been completely blown out of proportion by nearly every media outlet.</p>

        <p>&rt; Well, if those are just my opinions, then they would also just be Trump's opinions, would they not? </p>
<p>This thread just really isn't worth pursuing that much. President Trump makes a public statement about anything scientific. Since you're forgetting, let's run down the areas where Trump has made pretty solid statements of "opinion":</p>
<p>1) COVID is not dangerous because it's not in America
2) The COVID death tolls are being inflated, causing fatality rates to be artificially high
3) COVID will disappear in spring and summer, just like the flu
4) COVID is just the flu
5) On hydroxychloroquine, before any randomized data and after Fauci suggested that more work needs to be done: "“HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE &amp; AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,”</p>
<p>And this is a prevalent pattern in the Trump era. You're just not hearing that much about, either because you're ignoring it, or because your media sources aren't telling you. The general trend is you either fall in line with the administration thinking, or your funding/position gets rolled back or eliminated. This is in relation to environmental science, climate science, geological research, and so on. Here's an article from the dreaded NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/28/climate/trump-administration-war-on-science.html">summarizing the phenomenon we've seen since 2016.</a> Read it or don't; it doesn't change the facts that you will be punished if you speak your contrary opinion with regard to this admin, and the bootlickers are the ones prevailing at this time. </p>
<p>You prop up a strawman saying that I'm condemning people who happen to share the opinion of the president. I am not. I'm condemning the president for punishing people who don't share his opinions that he seems to come up with on the fly to help get himself out of trouble.</p>

<p>&rt;On hydroxychloroquine, <strong>before any randomized data</strong> and after Fauci suggested that more work needs to be done: "“HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE &amp; AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, <strong>have a real chance to be</strong> one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,”</p>
<p>The claim was that they had a chance to be a game changer before it was studied. Maybe a study ended up showing it wasn't that effective, but that doesn't change the potential it had. I hope that helps you understand this very basic idea, since you aren't able to apply logic or the scientific method to even your own thinking.</p>
<p>And I see you haven't disputed the fact that only a fucking idiot would hold the opinions you expressed about who decides which scientists prosper.</p>

Notice how the left controls almost every major corporation, world government, bank, social media platform, and disagreeing with leftist ideologies such as lockdowns gets you silenced and alienated from society, all while making you think Trump and those on the right are crazy elites who want to take over the world.</p>

        <p>You have a utopian idea of leftism.  We have seen throughout history and are still seeing today what leftism looks like in practice.  Sure, Communism looks wonderful on paper, but it will always devolve into the totalitarian oligarchy we've seen in the USSR, PRC, Cuba, North Korea, and now in the US.</p>

        <p>Things going wrong -which happens all the time with any politics- is one thing, but what's ever been remotely communist about the US? There's been no attempt at communism there that's gone a bit pear-shaped, it's all capitalism, all the way: and when things go wrong it's not inherent to leftwing ideaology, it's the capitalist, elitist status quo reasserts itself, often due to deliberate sabotage and attacks. There are people in the US who think even our NHS is dangerously commie. It has its problems, certainly, but that one is not it. It's maybe about time they stopped accusing everything they don't like of being communist, and name a lockdown policy that results in harm to the working class, the closure of small business, and more power and money to the rich monopolists, for what it is.</p>

        <p>Because I read the news and the internet is full of Americans, and this isn't really one of the more nuanced questions on American culture. If there are communists they're very well hidden, and 'get extreme rightwingers elected and accomplish no communist goals whatsoever' is a very odd strategy for ones supposedly in control.</p>

        <p>What are you talking about. A man attracted to a woman's body is just the biproduct of wanting to reproduce.</p>
<p>A man attracted to a man's body is a homosexual who wants a sexual experience and not reproduction. (or woman and woman). Therefore they are mentally ill as their sexual acts do not stem from reproduction therefore that's not healthy or normal</p>

        <p>Homosexuality was only classified as a mental disorder because of the religiotards as I personally call them.</p>
<p>If we would have proper pushed back earlier against those people mentioned and refused to allow them to insert religion into science, Homosexuality would never have been deemed a mental disorder.</p>
<p>Actually when it comes to sexuality? There are no mental disorders.</p>
<p>There are things that are harmful to other people and should not be done IRL but as long as you keep those things in your own head or in artwork, I feel people should leave you alone.</p>

        <p>Eric Weinstein talks about the incredible amount of dogma and egotism involved in the scientific community. Scientists have their entire career invested in their ideas, the leaders in any field never want to let their theories be replaced by newer science, hence it takes an entire generation for the younger scientists to become the leaders and the established science to change. On top of all that, when you talk about medicine, there is an INCREDIBLE amount of money involved, easily the most corrupted branch of science.</p>

        <p>I would quibble with   "And all of them thought they were doing the right thing, and that their actions were supported by "the science" "</p>
<p>That is a broad brush, there is no real evidence that ALL scientists, engineers and doctors were ok with crimes. Some of them sure, some of them were against it. Silencing those opposed and promoting those that are on board with the regime is a normal behaviour (but still maybe reprehensible) even if no real crime is going on. How do you think spokesman are chosen?</p>

        <p>Not sure any of the scientists from Germany where getting there findings peer review by the science community at that time.  At that time they just dident want there familys being murdered. </p>
<p>Thankfully, America are getting rid of the president that locks kids in cages, the president who wanted to run for a 3rd term. So I think where safe from America tuning into 1940s Germany for now.</p>

        <p>They put unaccompanied minors in cages who tried crossing by themselves, normally teenagers. The trump administration started the policy of family separation as a deterrent, taking babies, toddlers, and children of all ages away from their parents and putting them in cages. This has been going on for over 3 years. Imagine if you spent 3 years of your childhood in jail, not for something you did, but what your parents did. Maybe you were even so young you can't remember your parents or even know their names.</p>
