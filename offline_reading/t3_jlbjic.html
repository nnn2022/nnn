        <p>God bless Archbishop Vigano! This is how bishops spoke before the Vatican II Religion replaced true Catholicism with a Leftist NGO -  back when the clergy believed in Jesus Christ and had zeal for the salvation of souls! If only more Catholic prelates would come forth and back him up.  I don't see it happening, though.  Even Cardinal Burke and Cardinal Sarah are men of Vatican II when push comes to shove.</p>

        <p>&rt;No one, up until last February, would ever have thought that, in all of our cities, citizens would be arrested simply for wanting to walk down the street, to breathe, to want to keep their business open, to want to go to church on Sunday. Yet now it is happening all over the world, even in picture-postcard Italy that many Americans consider to be a small enchanted country, with its ancient monuments, its churches, its charming cities, its characteristic villages. And while the politicians are barricaded inside their palaces promulgating decrees like Persian satraps, businesses are failing, shops are closing, and people are prevented from living, traveling, working, and praying. The disastrous psychological consequences of this operation are already being seen, beginning with the suicides of desperate entrepreneurs and of our children, segregated from friends and classmates, told to follow their classes while sitting at home alone in front of a computer.</p>
<p>Wow. I had been so disappointed that so few leaders in the church have had the courage to speak out against what's being done. This is good to see and very powerful.</p>

        <p>I read that and the entire thing is just the truth of everything going on...  What I'm interested in is if Trump will read this and what his reply would be to it</p>

        <p>God bless Archbishop Viganò. He is truly one of the good ones. His use of the term <em>Katekhon,</em> "the one who holds back", is a theological term referring to the someone or something holding back the fullness of the Antichrist. Once "the katekhon is removed" (2 Thess 2:7), the Antichrist will be revealed and usher in the tribulation right before the Apocalypse. The term is often used non-theologically and by analogy, so he is not saying that Trump is the Katekhon foretold in the Bible, necessarily, but his use of the term still sends a strong signal that this is truly a battle of divine importance and with spiritual significance. </p>
<p>A note on terminolgy: the good Archbishop is the Titular Archbishop of Ulpiana. In Catholicism all bishops need to be the bishop of a place. But sometimes you need bishops not bound to a specific place. To get around this, a man can become the bishop of a city that is no longer under Christian control or is in ruins - a titular bishop. So Viganò, is Archbishop of Ulpiana, but as Ulpiana is in ruins, this is only a technicality, a loophole in Canon Law. So it is more fitting to speak of him as simply "Archbishop Viganò" or "the former Apostolic Nuncio to the US" (the Nuncio is basically an ambassador from the Vatican), as these more accurately reflects his position and role in the Church.</p>
