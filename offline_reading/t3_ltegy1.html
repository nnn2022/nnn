    <strong>Honest question: can you prove coronavirus exists?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not trying to be contrarian or anything. I am a scientist, so I view things through the lens of needing evidence to believe things. Until we have good evidence, we don't make conclusions that direct us. I'm willing to be convinced, but some of the fundamental premises are shaky to me. Please send me resources, especially primary research papers (those are ideal) for any of these topics.</p>
<p>Can anyone prove that viruses exist and cause disease? They seem conveniently like exosomes to me, is there any proof they are exogenous and not just an endogenous response to infection/trauma/stress/whatever? Especially infecting an animal with a pure viral sample and seeing disease is what I'm hoping for. I use viruses, and they need to be made in animal cells. There is some 'thing' that you can image with EM, and can induce changes in target cells, but how do we know it isn't just a part of the human body?</p>
<p>How do we know this "new disease" isn't just the flu or cold relabeled? Flu deaths almost nonexistent this year, and yet covid deaths are almost equal to usual flu deaths. The symptoms are the same, and if you remember, they even officially started saying the common cold doesn't cause loss of taste so that it can be a unique symptom for covid. What is the evidence it is really new? The PCR tests just test for some unknown piece of RNA, how do you know where that comes from? I read the paper that made that test and they don't tell us why they chose that primer set, or prove that it doesn't pick up influenza samples. A few researchers out of california said in 1500 samples they tested, all of them are influenza not something new. </p>
<p>Even if it is a new disease, why is the response shutting down small businesses (not walmart), wearing masks to trap bacteria on your face, and standing an artibrary distance from other people? I know that these things are designed to crush small business, consolidate commerce into mega corporations more, and make people scared of each other, but what is the logic in peoples' minds?</p>
<p>Like I said, I really do want to be convinced whatever the truth is, so please send me anything you have and I'll get on board. Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>The fact that this question is so controversial, lends credence to the skepticism.  </p>
<p>I'm not a scientist, but I do enjoy history and the scientific method.  I think the black plague, Spanish influenza, Ebola, and many other historical references will point to the existence and occurrence of viruses.  </p>
<p>While I don't see coronavirus as a serious threat, I do think it's safe to say it's a real thing that exists in our world.</p>

        <p>Even on a sub like this, people get as dogmatic as those they criticize when you go outside their comfort zone. Usually, people get defensive because they don't know how to answer but their worldview (or part of it) is challenged. I could be totally wrong, but I haven't seen these big questions addressed, people just assume and gloss past them. </p>
<p>Things like the plague could be true without viruses, that was supposed to have been caused by a bacteria. The other examples, I don't know too much about though but perhaps I will have to look deeper there, thanks for the ideas</p>

        <p>I am a scientist too. I cannot answer your question. Except to notice, this Johns Hopkins expert reports that the medical industry kills 685 / day in the U.S.: <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2822345-Hopkins-CDC-letter.html">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2822345-Hopkins-CDC-letter.html</a>.</p>
<p>And I see the CDC covering that up instead of warning the public about this preventable causes of death. And I see that what the CDC is doing there is not science. It's marketing-propaganda for multi-trillion dollar industry.</p>
<p>And the news does ten thousand stories about Covid-19 but none about 685 killed / day by the medical industry in the U.S.</p>
<p>So when I see how far the government and medical industry are straying from science, I figure Covid-19 is a relatively small deal even if it's as bad as they say.</p>
<p>I don't know the answer to your question.</p>

        <p>Interesting point, thanks. You are right medicine is downright frightening these days. Not much of a shock since a couple families bought out every medical school and made them all about giving patented drugs and surgeries instead of making people well again. I have a hard to knowing what to trust because whenever I look into treatments, the evidence is lacking for their use like fluoride, vaccines, chemotherapy. I want to believe they are looking out for us, those things really are the best, etc but I just don't see the evidence and there is actually a lot to the contrary.</p>

        <p>My field is cognitive science, mathematical models of thoughts, like a physicist makes mathematical models of physical objects. Investigating how medical theories evolve, end up in medical textbooks, and are put into practice is scary. Comparing doctors' notes about I what I said to tape-recordings of what I really said, seeing my words doctored, and that's the only official data that will ever be looked at. I'll stop before I go on all night. I fear the medical industry far more than I fear Covid-19.</p>

        <p>I can easily see them under a microscope, watch them divide, and even culture samples taken from infections. They also just make sense, viruses don't. It seems awfully convenient that they need cells to replicate, so they could just be a part of those cells not some other entity. Maybe they are real, I'm just saying I haven't seen evidence and that is why I'm asking for it</p>

        <p>What on earth are you saying? It is convenient that the theory of viruses says they can't replicate on their own and need a living cell, it seems like that could be just describing exosomes. I wasn't referring to any sickness at all. I have been scouring the internet and can't find this info, but I want the coronavirus believers to have a chance to speak up on what their evidence is to be fair in case I missed anything.</p>

        <p>But <em>how</em> is that aspect of viral reproduction convenient for <em>anybody</em>? Convenience implies a benefit. Who are you alluding to that gets to enjoy this apparent convenience, and how?</p>
<p>If you've scoured the internet and not found anything, you're either (a) not conducting a very good lit review and/or (b) willfully disregarding the volumes and volumes of research on the matter. Google Scholar is at your disposal. If you're a scientist, you probably have access to other scholarly search engines. At the very least, go to Wikipedia, check their sources, review their sources' sources, etc.</p>
<p>Edit: changed some phrasing from identity-based to behavior-based.</p>
