    <strong>Job prospects for unvaccinated?</strong>
    <p><p>Recent college graduate and I am sort of in an in-between point of my life, as I’ve moved home but am not officially out
in the workforce (I’m doing landscaping and yard jobs for the summer). There’s intense pressure from family members to take the vaccine; ideally I’d like to move out and get a job/my own place to have a bit a peace, but I’m a bit worried about the job market give the current mass paranoia and propaganda drive around the shot. </p>
<p>Would mentioning that im not willing to take the vaccine hurt my chances in an interview? Should it be brought up at all, since this seems to be somewhat important to a lot of agencies reopening in-person? Or Is it even worth looking in the area I majored in? ( received a bachelor and master in social work, was hoping to work in a clinical setting and eventually obtain my LCsW before the Covid stuff began). I’m sure there are some therapists or mental health agencies out there who were against the lockdowns but it’s hard to find them. I’ve been looking into alternative care centers that seem to prioritize healthy eating and holistic approaches to Heath but it’s hard to tell who has been drinking the Covid narrative Kool-Aid from websites alone. </p>
<p>Currently I’m in Colorado — Maybe rural settings would care less? — but have been thinking about Texas. Would be cool to not have to wear a mask/Scarlet Letter all day but I realize this may be a compromise I have to make at many places if unvaccinated.</p></p>

        <p>I think you will find a place that won't force it. Look for a smaller setting and just be upfront with them that you will not be getting it and will not wear a mask. You won't know until you try. You could also open up your own clinic, lots of vacant office space now. Best of luck.</p>
