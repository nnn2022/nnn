    <strong>I think I’m about to flip the fuck out</strong>
    <p><p>I literally can’t take it anymore. The constant “this is the new normal” over a fucking virus with a very small death rate, the constant politicization. Everything that used to be fun is just a drag, no going out to eat, no watching the game at the bar... no movies without “mAsKs”, no movies coming out, must wear masks everywhere. How the hell can we even fight this? In the USA the media loves to defame anyone and everything, you have so called “experts” saying it must be like this forever. When the fuck does it fucking stop. Like I said I’m on the verge of having a royal freakout.</p></p>

        <p>I feel better knowing I’m not the only one feeling this way. Seems like in every direction I turn there’s someone ready to shame me, make me feel stupid, or verbally assault me for being a terrible person (if they knew my opinion on all this, which I never share for this exact reason). Thank you for making me feel a little less defeated and alone during this time.</p>

        <p>I know they can be hard to find but don't give up! Early on I found a Reopen group on facebook for my state and started going to their protests and gatherings. I don't go much anymore because I am fortunate to have plenty (though far from all) of my friends and family willing to meet. But I would certainly be going if I didn't have that. I'm sure there are people in your area who feel as you do, it's just a question of finding them.</p>

        <p>You are NOT alone thinking like this. Even some doomers are secretly scared of the monster *they* have created. When enough people lose their jobs, homes and possessions will they think : "maybe the "cure" was worse than the scamdemic". Sadly I think we will be seeing people (who lost their homes) living in cars WITH masks! There is a sucker born every minute. It is now just easier to spot them. People NEED to eat, so eventually food will become more important than the cult of the virus. Just don't get suckered into any poisonous "vaccine" for a flu that has over 99.7% recovery rate. At this point in history, you are completely right in thinking that most people have gone completely insane! VERY sad that the young are paying the price for the idiocy of the olds!</p>

        <p>Hey man I’ve been exactly where you are. This plandemic has taken away my 2 jobs, my enjoyment of life and literally all plans and prospective employment for the meantime. I have friends who stopped talking to me once I told them the truth about all this ‘new normal’ bs, they couldn’t handle it. I have 3 degrees in healthcare and somehow my opinion is invalid, like they know better with their high school diploma. All I can tell you is to hang in there, I feel like it’s gonna get a little more stupid and worse before it starts getting better and people wake up and realize this virus which has a ~97% survival rate is not a big fucking deal.</p>

        <p>Like, I haven't had a friend in EIGHT YEARS and I'm sick of this crap.</p>
<p>I unlike pro-lockdowners understand that people need friends, need real life socialization not just online chatting.  The only real life socialization I get is with talking to my family (family is different from friends).</p>
<p>I understand that people lose their jobs. </p>
<p>I understand people are committing suicide more because of this crap.</p>
<p>I understand that people are building up this uncontrollable rage inside that will someday unleash.</p>
<p>Who cares if some people die, people die from all the time. </p>
<p>Not a lot of people die from covid, so why not just add it to the list of crap old people die to.</p>
<p>So, open the world so people can live in hope of a future, not in fear.</p>

        <p>People who say “if you idiots just followed the guidelines this would have been over” are not thinking straight, actually no, that’s like “reverse logic” the fact is if everyone IGNORED the guidelines it would be over quicker, because everybody would have gotten sick right away and developed immunity... not to mention covid is never going away, and its unrealistic to expect that locking down will ever change that.</p>

        <p>I agree. Even a few weeks ago I wouldn’t have been so keen to speak out about the bs to people I know in real life, let alone a few months ago, but now I’m doing it more and more and actually have people agreeing with at least some of what I’m saying. I think it’s a very slow burn but I do think more people are waking up. Doesn’t help the media is full blown doomer right now on the “casedemic”.</p>

Fuck off with that “uR sO sElfIsh aNd u wANt pEopLe tO dIe” bullshit. “Movies” are the sprinkles on a very fucked up cake that has cost people their livelihoods over a virus that has plummeting death rates (US) and tons of mild and asymptomatic cases except in older and obese populations.</p>

        <p>People have been dying since the beginning of time, and they will keep dying until the end of time. I don’t see you trying to ban alcohol for all the deaths it causes, or smoking for all the damage it does. People are dying both directly and indirectly from that. </p>
<p>You don’t shut down the entire country, throw 50 million people out of work and leave them and their families to starve, ruin the mental health of everyone in the world, and lower the immune systems of the everyone on the planet to the point where they will die the next time they get the common cold, all so a few 78 year olds can live an extra month before dying of cancer, old age, or any one of a billion different other causes. </p>
<p>Liberty is more important than safety. Those who would sacrifices liberty for safety deserve neither. Give me liberty, or give me death. Shall I go on, or has your entitled butt heard enough?</p>

        <p>Yes, that’s terrible. But you want to know something? The deaths are PLUMMETING here in the USA. I understood the restrictions at the beginning, but at this point almost a year of this virus and we’re still playing these stupid games, it’s illogical. Deaths peaked in April-May, and even with fear mongering talks of a THIRD WAVE!!! It’s still going down.</p>

        <p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that just because a few people died doesn't justify the lockdowns.</p>
<p>Sure, their family and friends will be sad they're gone.</p>
<p>But, death happens all the time why not just add covid to the list.</p>
<p>I don't look at the individual lives affected by death, I look at the total number of deaths.</p>

        <p>2020 is the official year of crazy statements. I only use hyperbole because I've heard the same arguments over and over. I don't think it's fair to blame the common people not following inhumane and insane restrictions on basic liberty. All of these crazy restrictions are a purely optional response anyway and once the people have had enough, they're just gonna stop complying, signs of which are already happening. So either the restrictions will fade because no-one follows them anymore, or the governments go full-on police state, which has also already happened in some places.</p>
<p>Personally I believe that after this winter most people are just gonna say fuck it and start mass civil disobedience. Especially in places where the economy is absolutely fucked and unemployment skyrocketing.</p>

        <p>Well I see where you're coming from, but I think it's also important to let it out, to voice your frustration, and many people can't do that irl because they're treated as criminals. It's ok to be whiney.</p>
