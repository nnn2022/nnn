    <strong>If you got the Measles vaccine and caught Measles it would be said the vaccine was ineffective. If you get the Covid shot and get Covid that's as expected.</strong>
    <p><p>Neither RNA shots claim to prevent infection and transmission. They only claim to reduce <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/verify-moderna-and-pfizer-vaccines-may-prevent-disease-but-not-infection/65-f65cb7ee-24dc-48d0-bc08-8cfb3423a3b6">symptoms</a>.</p>
<p>If so many people are asymptomatic already how do they even compute effectiveness in the first place? They might have had no symptoms without becoming a GMO first.</p>
<p>How do these gene therapy companies compute a 95% effectiveness when people still get it and people were already asymptomatic in great numbers.</p></p>

        <p>I know someone who got mumps as a teenager, he was vaccinated against mumps. He got it from a girl who (somehow) had be double vaccinated. He tells me this is just how vaccines work. ü§£</p>

        <p>lol.. i have the feeling, that the bitter truth is, vaccinations were never meant to heal anything, just poinson us. back then and now..</p>
<p>and i bet the stories about us getting rid of deseases like pilio via vaccines can be debunked as some genius propaganda</p>
<p>..its just my feeling tho. how about you?</p>

        <p>Our eugenics-loving overlords and their vaccine racketeers have a corrupt history using sleight of hand, re-diagnosing things as needed.</p>
<p>They still do that with polio in Third World countries, label it AFP or GBS.  DDT, the real culprit of most ‚Äúpolio‚Äù paralysis, is still heavily used in India, China etc.</p>
<p>&rt;‚ÄùGeorge Bernard Shaw, the illustrious poet and also an ardent campaigner on public health issues, once stated: </p>
<p>&rt;"During the last considerable epidemic at the turn of the century, I was a member of the Health Committee of London Borough Council, and <strong>I learned how the credit of vaccination is kept up statistically by diagnosing all the re-vaccinated cases (of smallpox) as postular eczema, varioloid or what not - except smallpox".</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Explaining the <strong>practice of 're-diagnosis‚Äô</strong> and the reasons behind it, Leon Chaitow says ‚Äú... faced with a patient who has all the signs and symptoms of a particular disease, from which they have been ‚Äòprotected‚Äô by immunization, it is obviously difficult to make the diagnosis they would have made if faced by such a case in an unvaccinated person.  <strong>By calling the disease something else they are protecting their belief system,</strong> and the integrity of the theories around which they have built their actions, such as vaccination.... All this is done to protect a system, and to help to save the public from having doubt as to the efficacy of methods. <strong>Re-diagnosis is a real phenomenon, and happens all the time. In the case of diphtheria this was rampant,</strong> and it is interesting to note that it was only the vaccinated cases of diphtheria which were diagnosed as something else. <strong>In some epidemics the figure of re-diagnosis reached 60% of cases.</strong> It is hard to see what sense can be made of statistics when they are based on inaccuracies of this sort".</p>

        <p>I think there‚Äôs something to that.  Eugenicists like the Rockefeller Syndicate own/control the banks, Big Pharma, WHO, CDC, AMA, FDA, media outlets etc.</p>
<p>&rt;"Harry Nelson, Medical Editor for L.A. Times, reported on an American Cancer Society Seminar for Science Writers, and announced that microbiologists have uncovered new findings that incriminate vaccination. One of the participants was <strong>Dr. Robert M. Simpson of Rutgers University, N.J., who stressed that ‚ÄòImmunization programs against flu, measles, mumps, and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form proviruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body</strong> ...Some of these could be molecules in search of a disease, which under proper conditions become activated and <strong>cause a variety of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Parkinson‚Äôs disease and perhaps cancer."</strong> This quote is from the Honorof Report for June, 1976.‚Äù</p>

        <p>You are oversimplifying, mate. MMR is 97% effective which means that 3 out of 100 vaccinated people won't develop immunity after the shot. It doesn't mean it's ineffective though, and nobody says that, because it is expected that some people will still get sick. I do share your sentiment, but bringing bullshit to the discussion only make us all look kinda dumb. Just saying.</p>

<p>Meaning it's ineffective for those 3 people. </p>

        <p>Yeah, or maybe unlike you, I comprehend that it isn't binary system we have here on this planet. There's entire spectrum between "it works" and "it doesn't work". And they kinda teach people that in elementary, so you might kinda revisit your syllabus.</p>
<p>You're real good at fingerprinting though, kid. Gotta give you that. We've been doing that too on IRC back in the day when people needed to know how computers work in order to use them. Good for ya</p>
