        <p>I feel you OP but for real. I work in homeland security, if people had any clue how vulnerable our critical infrastructure system is there would be legitimate mass panic. I could make a few SHTF possibilities which could cripple entire sections of the world by targeting just one of the sixteen sectors. Many of which are generally unguarded. If carried out meticulously it could make the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina look like a stroll in the park. </p>
<p>All that being said, there are ample securities which the lay person couldn’t penetrate but any malicious person with an in depth knowledge could shut the nation down for weeks</p>
<p>Edit: I’m not in the department of homeland security, I work in the field of homeland security. Small but important differentiation.</p>

        <p>Network engineer here.  I swear half the SCADA equipment on the fucking planet is protected by "password1" and most of the other half is "companyname".  No one cares about backups.  No one cares about DR infrastructure.  No one cares about stocking spare equipment in case production stuff shits the bed.</p>
<p>The country could honestly fall apart if too many infrastructure workers are too hung over to work one day and call in sick.</p>

        <p>Bingo. I wasn’t even referring to SCADA but data acquisition alone is potentially the most vulnerable system that every nation utilizes outside of designated individuals (which  are always on rotation due to promotions/retirement/ termination/transfers). </p>
<p>People have no idea. I’ve had the misfortune to respond to an overturned passenger train before. Shit down the cities transportation system for a week. Same with a fire under the highway. Shut down the transportation system for two weeks. Imagine if someone targeted the energy sector, information tech sector, or nuclear sector directly. All are borderline insecure. Sure they have security staff watching a camera from afar but no real capabilities. Now imagine a malicious coalition targeting multiple at once. It’d cause mayhem on an unprecedented level. Not to mention in the cyber realm attack like Stuxnet and the recent solarwinds attack. I swear the world is one massive Mexican standoff. We all possess the capabilities but no one wants to be the one to pull the trigger because they know what’s next</p>

        <p>This pseudo pandemic will be nothing compared to when they shut er down, if they do, which is something we should all be paying attention to. The whole grid could go down from a solar flare (last one big enough was mid 1800's), cyber attack from a malicious actor (like your government), or a private actor or group. It will happen someday. There is no doubt...could be many years...could be this November. I believe this whole attack on the people is far from over. Expect another major surge of death from a virus or vax side effects (they'll call it something other than vaccine assisted death), or from a cyber attack. Can you imagine a 2 month long power outage in the DEAD of winter? So many people would die. Hundreds of millions. Stay safe. Be kind. Keep one eye open.</p>
