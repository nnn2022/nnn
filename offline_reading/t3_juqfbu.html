    <strong>Where are the excess deaths for 2020?</strong>
    <p><p>According the the article from the CDC "Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020." I found an article thats states "So far this year, 2.39 million Americans have died of all causes (as of October 9, 2020)." Based on my math below we have not even hit the total of 2018 deaths. So are all these articles claiming excess deaths for 2020 are just cherry picking dates in time to make their comparison and state we had 300k excess deaths. This is false information and we have not even hit 2018 overall death total. Being in a pandemic with shut downs I would expect to see more deaths than prior years by October. So as of October 9, 2020 we will need 449,000 more deaths in this year to equal 2018. Overall deaths.</p>
<p>Also based on the CDC there have been on average 300k deaths per month.  Just using some simple math aren't we right on track for deaths in 2020? I could not the US death total for 2019. We have an average increase in "overall deaths" of 49,000 from year to year from 2012-2018.</p>
<p>2,839,205 (total 2018 deaths) − 2,390,000 (total 2020 deaths) = 449,205</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree with this, directly comparing 2019 and 2020 numbers and then counting any deviation as excess is misleading. </p>
<p>A aging and increasing population will result in a general upswing in deaths year after year. If this isn’t accounted for, excess deaths are misleading IMO.</p>

        <p>I've been mentioning this a lot recently, but if you look on the CDC page they tell you how they calculate Excess Death.</p>
<p>&rt;Weekly numbers of deaths by age group and race/ethnicity were assessed to examine <strong>the difference between the weekly number of deaths occurring in 2020 and the average number occurring in the same week during 2015–2019</strong> and the percentage change in 2020. </p>
<p>There is some logical wonkiness in there.</p>
<p>Let's figure out your "expected salary" for this year.  We will look at your salaries over the past 5 years, average all those to find an "average salary", and then whatever you made above that average can be called "2020 excess salary" and is a sign that you made too much this year.</p>
<p>Make sense?</p>

<p>They are comparing deaths during a span of time in 2020 to deaths during the same span of time in previous years. How is that false information? How is comparing the first nine months of 2020 to the first nine months of 2018 any less correct than comparing all 12 months of 2020 to all 12 months of 2018? The obvious problem there is that we don't have data from all 12 months of 2020.</p>
<p>&rt;So as of October 9, 2020 we will need 449,000 more deaths in this year to equal 2018. Overall deaths.
&rt;
&rt;Also based on the CDC there have been on average 300k deaths per month.  Just using some simple math aren't we right on track for deaths in 2020?</p>
<p>Using the numbers you gave, we would expect 200,000 more deaths in October (as the data only included the first third of the month), and 600,000 more in November and December. That would put us 350,000 deaths over 2018, and that's not including increasing numbers of deaths due to a rising number of COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations in recent weeks.</p>

        <p>I agree with some of this assessment. Not having 2019 total deaths changed things a bit. However,  we could use the average of 50k deaths for 2019. That is the average increase. We also need to account for lockdown death: suicides &amp; missed Hospital treatments that may have resulted in the increase as well. It'll be interesting see how it plays out overall.

<p>There is such a daily deluge of data regarding this pandemic, both on social media and in the press, that it is often difficult to digest. It is hard to put it all into context. This pandemic has impacted all of us, and so it makes sense that we all have our own perspectives regarding what it all means; many of us sift through the data trying to find answers. </p>
<p>The pandemic has had such a profound impact on our collective behavior, that there is no doubt this would be reflected in our causes of death. Outside of COVID deaths, there are likely increases in some causes of death and decreases in others.</p>

        <p>You're right, and it's funny how the numbers OP posted actually confirm excess deaths from COVID.</p>
<p>From the first link they posted, as of Oct 3, \~2.4M deaths from all causes. Extrapolating that the end of the year (basically multiply by 1.33 since Oct 3 leaves 3 full months of deaths out of 12 months in the year), 2.4M x 1.33... you get 3.2M deaths projected by end of year which exceeds previous years by around 250-400K which lines up with current US death toll.</p>
<p>OPs second link literally says it's false info that 2020 deaths are not more than previous years, and that even before extrapolating to end of year, current deaths this year still outpace prior years during same time period.</p>
