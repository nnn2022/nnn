    <strong>This will never end</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been going ok for a little while. I’ve been keeping busy with lots of puzzles and cooking projects. Even though I read this and other subs regularly, I somehow had hope or something. I was ok. Today I made the mistake of reading a news item in an email. </p>
<p>I did not know that there is a quarantine for citizens of Chicago if they travel to certain states. They are supposed to be voluntarily quarantining themselves. It’s not enforced but somehow there are fines anyway. Mayor Lightfoot wants to add Indiana to the list now. https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-02-14-0302140308-story.html. How is this legal?</p>
<p>There’s just no hope of this ending. There’s no purpose or sound reason to have everything closed. No concerts. No fests. No sports. No SCHOOL!?! I have no social activities. I can’t go to talks at the library or local museums. I used to attend church and sing in the choir. All social life has stopped for me. There’s no end in sight. </p>
<p>The lockdown is a ridiculous idea. It’s hard to believe there were adults in charge of things.</p></p>

        <p>It's not enforceable but you're right all this non-sense is crazy.  Wisconsin and Michigan are issuing more orders even after the supreme court in those states ruled that is unconstitutional.  The issue is that courts only become involved if they try to enforce it, which they don't.  So they can make all these "orders" and get the sheep to be hostile to those who don't blindly follow and the courts do nothing because as long as they aren't arresting anyone, the court is never involved.  Pisses me off so much.</p>

        <p>Wisconsin's mask mandate will hopefully be overturned this week, and the new mandate is unenforceable (i.e. the cops don't want to deal with it), so we're pretty much back to 'ignore the governor, he's an idiot.'</p>

        <p>I try to think positively that once a vaccine is out they’ll turn around and use it as their savior.</p>
<p>But I just don’t know. So many are in so deep with this manufactured insanity. We overreacted and threw out the playbook because China said so. That is scary.</p>

        <p>Last I heard the team at Oxford University here in the UK is making the most progress with developing a vaccine. If you think Boris will be able to sort out a vetting programme to ensure it goes to those most in need and at risk first, manage expectations realistically as to when people will be able to get one and distribute it efficiently, then you have a lot more faith than I do!</p>
<p>Very disappointed in the BBC’s sporadic reporting on this. Last I heard, the team at Oxford said they were hoping to release the vaccine in December, but our chief advisor Chris Whitty then says it might not be available until next December. JFC, which is it!?</p>

        <p>November is when it should be released to the US, UK, Canada and maybe the EU. That is the timeline these companies are giving as they are doing rolling reviews right now.</p>
<p>I am afraid they will all be rejected, however. I am afraid they will, if accepted, still not bring us back to normal. Part of me wonders if it is because the doubling down - gotta hold out to pay off those companies (I am appalled these companies are getting so much money for this when they have been working on cancer treatments, and other things, which will now lost so much money and research time). Will they be used as the silver bullet to get us back to normal because it is what was said in March as if they already had the plan? Will they be ignored and mocked as media thinks to keep us in perpetual perma-lockdown? Many states in the USA will not reopen even with one, like CA and WA.</p>
<p>I want to be positive but I think there is no intent to 'allow' society to return to normal though I read recently BoJo is talking about 'after' all of this and using it to fuck more people over, so they do think a vaccine will be their golden way out.</p>
