    <strong>Why are the pro-covid vax people so scared to admit that things may not be as bad as they are?</strong>
    <p><p>1) I know one person who got it. I've never denied that it exists, and I'd not want to get it myself. However he recovered, and he said it sucked, but neither his older parents or the rest of his family got it, so "deadliest most virulent disease" indeed.</p>
<p>2) Masks are just for hiding. Ye Olde Bandana isn't going to prevent you from getting anything, and most masks purchased in store clearly say "not for medical use". It's social anxiety on full display.</p>
<p>3) Medical history is now apparently for all to consume. If you told a waiter or a store clerk "I have cancer" or "I have renal failure" they'd look at you funny. So why are we now expected to disclose vax/health status to strangers? It sets us up for citizens being elevated to volunteer enforcers, and propagates more social division and blind obedience.</p>
<p>4) You can't unring a bell. That's how I look at the rushed untested experimental stage thing they're wanting to inject into everyone. Myself not included. And why so much censorship over the side effects, but more importantly why are the pro-whatevers so dismissive of them? You claim to be health conscious, but being told this new vax may harm you isn't something you want to know?</p>
<p>5) IMHO, the provax/mask lovers are embarrassed to admit they may have been wrong, but instead of saying "I was wrong", they're tripling down and becoming more fanatical instead of accepting that people make mistakes. A lot of people in this case.</p></p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt believe big pharma has my best interests at heart, but I do believe modern medicine has done wonders for humanity.</p>
<p>Smallpox has killed billions throughout history, including 300-500 million since 1900. Modern medicine eliminated it.</p>
<p>Measles killed millions of children for centuries. 75 years ago you would be hard pressed to find a single person that didn‚Äôt know a child who had died to it. Because of modern medicine measles outbreaks are mostly a thing of the past (at least in the west.)</p>
<p>Polio killed or permanently disabled millions and outbreaks were almost a yearly occurrence. Because of the vaccine I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if not a single person here knows anyone under fifty who had polio. </p>
<p>And there are many more examples. Mumps, Rubella, Shingles, etc. </p>
<p>The truth is modern medicine has gotten us to the point where diseases that wrought havoc on humanity for millennia are little more than an afterthought. COVID wasn‚Äôt as bad as those, but it was still bad enough that the world completely shut down. There are many issues I have with the way things are handled but for me it comes down to one simple thing: money.</p>
<p>There is ENORMOUS financial incentive to create a working vaccine, even if the virus isn‚Äôt that bad. Hell, Pfizer and Moderna are household names now. At the same time there is ENORMOUS risk to a company if the vaccine ends up being highly dangerous. Look at the (now bankrupt) Purdue Pharma as an example. I got the vaccine because I trust modern medicine as a whole. Not because I trust the government or the pharma industry. If I didn‚Äôt then I wouldn‚Äôt go to a doctor if I was sick. I wouldn‚Äôt go to the hospital if I was injured. I‚Äôd just take some essential oils or something. Maybe modern medicine will fail me and I‚Äôll be screwed because I took the vaccine. But vaccines as a whole have a pretty freaking phenomenal track record and I watched Covid put my mom in the hospital for six agonizing weeks and take my friend‚Äôs sense of taste and smell for six months. My personal risk assessment led me to choose the vaccine as the safer of the two options.</p>

        <p>You probably know far more than one person who got covid; they just didn't know because most people don't. The CDC says as of April, probably 114m Americans have had it, that's 4 times greater than the number we usually see. And that's those who have developed antibodies.</p>
<p>This is widely known and in almost all official records, but you won't see it on CNN.</p>

        <p>This is one thing I didn't understand all throughout the last year. MSM (in Canada) was focused on death rate and how high it was but would also say there may be 3-10 times more cases in the public that are unknown. If that were the case the deathrate would be SIGNIFICANTLY lower than what they had originally reported. I tried explaining this to a few people but they just kept denying it. </p>
<p>I often calculated the "deathrate" using the 3-10 times more cases and it was lower than the flu deathrate at that point.</p>

        <p>Well, you have to remember that they completely inflated the death rate right off the bat as well. In Ontario and Nova Scotia almost all the early deaths were in old age centers. When they looked into in Ontario, they blamed neglect. In Nova Scotia, and I believe in Ontario, family members weren't allowed in to see their loved one who was dying of...neglect.</p>
<p>And labelled as a covid death.</p>

        <p>Ya. That info only officially came out later in the year. They also announced that suicides were also counted as covid deaths....apparently because "there was no way to report them separately given the current system". Absolute insanity</p>

        <p>i've been saying this epsecially when it comes to reopenings, low death rates in states that have lifted mask mandates, new variants being less severe... these are all GOOD developments. but some people have their heels dug in hard and can't reconcile the party line with reality. if politics are removed from it, all of this is objectively good news.</p>

<p>You are so much more likely to die in a car accident but that didn‚Äôt stop people from rushing out to see another new stupid Marvel movie, or go Black Friday shopping, or anything else.

        <p>It definitely will, and I think it‚Äôs by design. Even something as simple as the mask has made connecting with people that much harder. You can‚Äôt read their body language, see their smile. Major things that attract and connect you to people.</p>
<p>Going to be much easier to sell out people in your community if you have never even seen their face, or been friendly with them because you end up distancing from them.</p>
<p>People are even staying away from their own family members already. </p>
<p>You are correct, this cold world is going to be completely colder and more clinical and that‚Äôs not a suitable environment for humans.</p>

        <p>I mean sorry to completely shit on a political movement but the modern left is a psycho cult. People on the whole are more narcissistic by nature in modern days and when you are also carrying around baggage that makes you feel like a victim in any circumstance you begin to be very hateful. Unpopular opinion, but I think anti bullying campaigns and ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù movements destroyed the culture we live in. Get some guts, if you‚Äôre going to ‚Äúlet your freak flag fly‚Äù or be an unpleasant person to be around, you‚Äôre probably gonna be called out for it, either don‚Äôt give a fuck, or punch that bully in the mouth. This whole going to the teacher and whining about it only reinforces your subconscious to regard authority figures as your rulers who can make ‚Äúthe haters‚Äù go away, leaving you to never face your problems directly. When you raise a generation of over emotional tattle tails this is what you get, a bunch of adult children still seeking validation from others, something a child would do. The also hold grudges, lack accountability, and in general face every situation handed to them in with a chip on their shoulders, leading them to be constantly stressed out and unhappy. They then feed this unhappiness with a political movement focused on the negative, and unfortunately by teaming up with the other unhappy rejects they are able to put their negative, almost anti-human sentiments in action. I say this as someone from that same generation. They should learn how to build a bridge, get over it and be happy. Stop worrying about kids being in cages on the border, you should be worried about the fact that you hate yourself and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs keeping you living at your moms house at 30 years old. I know it sounds callous, but so is the world, no one person has the time or energy to constantly think about all of the bad shit going on.</p>

        <p>I have no idea what the deal is, I just don't get it. Why did so many go completely bonkers over a virus that's hardly any more dangerous than a regular flu? I originally heard it was because it was so contagious, but let me tell where I work 3 people have had it, each and everytime we were on the same shift and I worked in very close proximity to them each time and so I was among those who had to go in quarantine and get a test 3 times. All negative. Also, this is over the course of about 7 or 8 months. Whenever 1 had it no one else at work got it despite them being at work while having it. So I gotta ask, how contagious is it really? In total we're about 25 people.</p>
<p>Oh, and everyone who had it didn't even realise they had it until they got a call saying they had been in contact  with someone else who had gotten it and had to test themselves. They say it felt like a slight cold and was with symptoms for 2-3 days, but wasn't allowed to go back to work until a week with no symptoms had passed.</p>

        <p>Alright I guess I‚Äôll chime in for the opposition. I got my second dose over a month ago. I‚Äôll go by each point I guess.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I also know people who got it and were relatively fine. I obviously don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the most deadly disease out there, but it does seem to be highly contagious and relatively dangerous to many members of our population. I still get vaccinated for the flu each year even though it isn‚Äôt gonna kill me as a 20 year old healthy male. I do spend a lot of time around grandparents however, so I just don‚Äôt want to have the possibility of getting someone seriously ill on my mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ye olde bandana will not block viral particles which is why it says ‚Äúnot for medical use‚Äù but an n95 will. What a face covering will do is reduce the velocity of airflow out of your mouth meaning that any contagions will travel less distance and have less a chance of infecting people. This is pretty well proven and why people say masks are less to protect you and more to protect others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sure I guess? I have yet to be questioned whether or not I‚Äôm vaccinated even though I haven‚Äôt been wearing a mask for a while and I live in a fairly liberal area. I would argue however that vaccine status is a bit more relevant than cancer diagnoses which is why I don‚Äôt think the comparison works that well. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I do want to know if the vaccine can harm me, I just don‚Äôt trust the sources many anti vaccine folk cite. I think the CDC has been pretty cautious about possible complications (freezing j&amp;j vax) and personally I think mRNA is well enough understood for me to be comfortable with the vaccine. Generally when I get the opportunity to investigate the source of the information I find a variety of issues which is why I end up dismissing the argument. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It‚Äôs funny because I feel the same way about many antivaxxers now that so many people have been vaccinated without issue. As the months go on and I continue to feel completely normal I‚Äôve really only become more seated in my belief that the vaccine is safe. I will say that if your looking for reasons for why vaxxed folk don‚Äôt wanna say they are wrong I would say fear plays into it. Nobody wants to listen to information that says they made a choice to endanger their health if that information is disputed. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am worried that something reputable about vaccine dangers could come out, but I‚Äôve weighed the dangers with the benefits of getting vaxxed and decided it was the right choice for me.</p>

        <p>And I am happy to see it. No one benefits from an echo chamber. We're all ( or should be ) striving to find the objective truth. And we can't find it without both "sides" participating in the discussion. The <strong>problem</strong> is that everyone is shutting down the discussion - which is concerning to say the least.   </p>
<p>I personally, have not and will not take the vaccine until I know for a fact that it is safe. My wife, on the other hand, has taken the Pfizer vaccine and has confidence in mRNA biotech. Of course, the injection site was sore for a day or two and she had mild symptoms but nothing like the horrible reports I've read or what I've seen in the VAERS data, thank God. My stepson also took the Pfizer vaccine and his symptoms were much worse than what my wife had. He said he felt like, "...absolute dogshit.. ".</p>

        <p>Yeah my roommates and I all had pretty severe post second dose side effects. Everyone felt like crap and had fevers. 48 hours later everyone felt back to normal. This was all clearly communicated to us by the administrating nurses and was talked about a lot in my university social groups. It seems that elderly folk tend to do better with the second dose, with none of my grandparents having any side effects.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm going to respond to this one, also as opposition, because it is the only one that hasn‚Äôt been downvoted yet. As he did, I will also respond point by point.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I know a few people who have contracted it. None of them died, but that‚Äôs because they are young enough that they don‚Äôt have to worry about it. However, it is very very rare that anyone young dies from it anyways, so no, it is not the deadliest disease, and essentially anyone with any knowledge of history also agrees that the virus is not ‚Äúthe most deadly‚Äù. Also, did the person who got it in OPs post see his family while sick?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person I‚Äôm responding to explained it better than I could have. I‚Äôll add one thing, why would doctors and nurses working in ICU wear masks at all times, even before covid, if they did nothing to protect anyone?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, the person I‚Äôm responding to explained it better than I could have. Your comparison is terrible though, renal failure nor cancer is contagious. If someone came to me and said ‚ÄúI have contracted Ebola‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have contracted the Black Plague‚Äù then yes, I would leave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wouldn‚Äôt say there is censorship over the side effects. Mostly every news source I‚Äôve seen has said side effects, including rare ones such as blood clots and heart attacks. I‚Äôm dismissive of them because there has been (since I‚Äôve last heard) only 10 cases of blood clots anywhere, out of millions of vaccines administered. Why are antivax so dismissive of the millions+ of doses with no symptoms more than a sore arm?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I feel like it‚Äôs more complex. I think most scientists, upon finding new information, say ‚Äúsorry, that was wrong. Here‚Äôs what you actually need to do to prevent infection.‚Äù Then the antivax crowd comes in and claims that the scientists were lying to them. It wasn‚Äôt lying, it was just a lack of information. They took information from previous, more researched viruses and applied it to Covid.</p>
</li>

        <p>&rt; What a face covering will do is reduce the velocity of airflow out of your mouth meaning that any contagions will travel less distance and have less a chance of infecting people. </p>

        <p>A lot of people live in an echo chamber, especially now with the rampant silencing and censoring of the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù opinion.  The news networks have shows mocking or belittling other shows and people of a different opinion, yes fox does it too (have not watched cable news in over 15 years).  The media is poison and it is killing civility and open dialogue, so when they see something that disagrees with their indoctrination they either dismiss it or get angry.</p>

        <p>&rt; IMHO, the provax/mask lovers are embarrassed to admit they may have been wrong, but instead of saying "I was wrong", they're tripling down and becoming more fanatical instead of accepting that people make mistakes. A lot of people in this case.</p>

        <p>You people always conveniently ignore places like Florida and Sweden. No catastrophe happened in these places. They actually did better with cases and deaths than many other places with heavy restrictions. Florida has the second oldest population in the US ffs. They opened way before any vaccine was available.</p>

        <p>Sweden also did better than many other countries in Europe. Love how you people act like you can only compare Sweden to its surrounding countries but jump to compare Australia and New Zealand with countries across the globe. You‚Äôre also still conveniently ignoring Florida. Just accept it. Most places overreacted and lockdowns were unnecessary.</p>

        <p>Why do anti-vaxxers think you‚Äôre interesting enough to microchip? Why can‚Äôt you understand the difference between irrelevant and relevant medical information? I mean honest to fucking God. I hate to be the one to break it to you, but I am not getting paid enough to fake a pandemic or try to trick you into getting a bad vaccine or whatever the fuck you all think it is, and neither is any other scientist I know. A few <em>have</em> had to get armed security guards for their offices due to excessive doxxing and death threats, though. But yes, we‚Äôre going through all of that just to <em>checks notes</em> ah yes, trick people into covering their faces. My God.</p>

        <p>1)  I am not aware of anyone calling it the deadliest disease.  However rates of transmission are incredibly high, and the more it transmits the more opportunity it has to mutate (which it has multiple times).  This is bad because a new strain can potentially mean no longer having antibodies that can fight it, or it can be even more transmittable and deadly. The death toll from covid is very real and nothing to laugh about (600k in US alone)  </p>
<p>2) Data shows masks are effective at preventing spread.  I have no idea where you got this idea it won't protect you.  The virus is most easily transmitted through droplets that masks can either catch (if droplets large enough) OR by simply helping reduce how far/quickly those droplets spread simply by being a barrier to breath.    </p>

<p>3) Cancer and/or renal failure doesn't affect others.  You have to tell a sexual partner if you have an STD.  This is no different.   </p>
<p>4) "Rushed" "Untested"  Very wrong.  mRNA have been in development for years.  The requisite number of trials was conducted.  The only thing "rushed" was the paperwork - not the science.  </p>
<p>5) How the fuck were pro-mask pro vaxers wrong?  Vaccines administered goes up, covid cases go down.  Countries that actually enacted and followed mask policies had significantly less cases per capita than countries that didn't.  You are talking out your ass.</p>
