    <strong>All the mainstream doctors in on it?</strong>
    <p><p>These are the smart people and the only doctors saying anything have colorful pasts.  They can't all be in on it.  Have they turned off their brains?</p>
<p>EIL5 why they are all going with the flow.  If us non MDs can see it. Why can't they?  Why won't they?</p></p>

        <p>There’s a few things I’m guessing going on:</p>
<p>1) indoctrination of established agencies: essentially what the CDC says is what goes. I’ve heard from a few doctors in the field that most practitioners don’t have the time to study or research, and thus follow standard guidelines. That’s why many who could potentially be critical thinkers simply aren’t bothering.</p>
<p>2) Fear of losing standing in the medical community, or even ability to practice. </p>
<p>3) Hospitals are incentivized to vaccinate as much as possible. In general there’s a lot of shady business in healthcare between big pharma and large health networks in overprescribing medicines so this is just a natural extension of an existing problem.</p>
<p>4) ideological. Unfortunately somehow being resistant to these experimental jabs is somehow political now, and maybe doctors who would challenge the status quo aren’t willing to see the problem because of their political beliefs/biases. Inversely those that lean the opposite direction don’t want to appear partisan.</p>
<p>Milgram experiment come to mind in general.</p>

        <p>Not all the doctors speaking up have colorful pasts. A lot of them have spoken against the mainstream narrative for years, which makes them easy targets, but look at the doctors on the FLCCC. Look at Dr. Peter McCullough. There are well-respected doctors with incredible careers whose medical breakthrought have improved the health of millions of people worldwide. They are being actively defamed solely based on what they are saying right now.</p>
<p>A lot of doctors are lazy. Others are afraid. The ones speaking up are being silenced unless they have the klout to push past the censhirship. Hundreds if doctors across the country aren't speaking up, necessarily, but are not recommending their patients pet the vaccine and are instead prescribing Ivermectin and recommending the i-Mask+ protocol for prevention. These are the same doctors that are actually treating people with the likes of ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, steroids, etc. instead of telling their patients to take some Tylenol and go to the ER when their lips turn blue.</p>
<p>There is a battle going on right now between the good doctors out there that see through the bullshit and the government agencies, big pharma, social media giants, mainstream media outlets, and shills of wide-ranging pay grades. It's just hard to see it unless you know where to look.</p>

        <p>A Canadian doctor, Charles Hoffe, who mainly serves First Nations patients, explains his troubles after speaking up about injuries his patients have received due to the experimental Moderna “vaccine”.
https://hive.blog/hive-110786/@drutter/sjbdolck</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“So what I’m telling people about is not some theory, this is what I have seen in my own patients. I’ve been a doctor to these patients for 28 years and now three of them are disabled by this first (Moderna) vaccine.</strong> And it upsets me very much because these people <strong>did not know</strong> that they were <strong>part of an experiment.”</strong>
(6:30-6:48)</p>
<p>&rt;“I just said <strong>with all these side effects appearing shouldn’t we perhaps just pause things for a while. Anyway, within 48 hours I had a very stern rebuke from my superiors</strong> at the Internal Health Authority who told me that I was <strong>guilty of causing ‘vaccine hesitancy’ and they were going to be reporting me to the college of physicians and surgeons in B.C.,</strong> and that I was <strong>forbidden from saying anything negative about the vaccine</strong> within our health facility. So I had been given a <strong>gag order</strong>. So initially I was a bit intimidated, because you know, unfortunately many doctors are because <strong>the colleges hold tremendous authority to literally shut down your livelihood</strong> or to give enormous fines. So I was a bit <strong>intimidated</strong> but as the week went on and <strong>I saw more and more people coming into my office with serious neurological problems,</strong> following their,… and this was just the first shot of the vaccine and we know that the second one gives much worse side effects. <strong>I became more and more angry about my gag order.”</strong>
(3:30-4:35)</p>
<p>&rt;“It grieved me greatly, that <strong>this is an experiment, and it grieved me that the first people that the government chose to sort of experiment on was the elderly and the First Nations people.</strong> Now I know that there were health care providers involved in that as well, and <strong>I was offered this vaccine and I said, ‘no thank you.</strong> I would like to be part of the unvaccinated control group for this experiment’. But it grieved me that all of the patients that I have that now have longterm, well, <strong>ongoing neurological side effects, are all First Nations people.</strong> Because they were the people who got it first and the rest of us are just getting it now.”
