    <strong>ACIP/CDC meeting today for J&amp;J vaccine data makes no sense</strong>
    <p><p>Im not one to immediately be a skeptic about things, however I refused to get a vaccine. I’m a healthcare provider and have a doctorate in pharmacy, my background has somewhat helped understand the medical information that’s given out. </p>
<p>Medical info to note: </p>
<p>The clots aren’t why they are pausing the vaccine, it’s the rare incidence of the cerebral clot PLUS thrombocytopenia (very low platelet count). Platelets are what cause clots, so it is very rare and concerning that patients have these huge clots with thrombocytopenia. </p>
<p>The PF4 antibody test: 
this is used to test whether or not a patient can treat clots with Heparin. If positive, the patient can NOT use heparin because of HIT (heparin induced thrombocytopenia). HIT incidence occurs in patients that have been on heparin for a while. It is very rare. FIVE out of the six cases tested positive. This seems to be because the vaccine is interfering with the body’s immune system and platelet factor 4. Sort of in the same way heparin causes HIT. </p>
<p>If you treat a patient with heparin, and they tested positive, they will experience severe thrombocytopenia. So now no one who has taken the J&amp;J vaccine is allowed to be treated with heparin until AFTER they get tested. It was stated that hospital don’t routinely have these tests available, they must be ordered, and usually then takes 48 hours to deliver. FOUR out of the 6 patients were treated with heparin....those four all were positive for the antibody. Way to induce HIT into patients that already have thrombocytopenia..</p>
<p>Just because this was a rare blood clot before, does not mean this vaccine has not made it incidence FAR more likely. </p>
<ol>
<li>A table of the 6 cases was shown at the beginning of the meeting. The second patient listed was from their clinical trial, received a PLACEBO vaccine, and had a CVST (the clots everyone is talking about). NO thrombocytopenia. (So it’s not the rare problem they are talking about) and tested negative for the PF4 antibody. This was the ONLY women in the table that had been taking oral contraceptives (known to increase clot likelihood).</li>
</ol>
<p>Later in the meeting, a slide titled “Characteristics of patients with CVST and thrombocytopenia after Janssen Covid-19 vaccine” states that 1 case had current estrogen use. The case they’re referring to is the placebo case? That didn’t even experience thrombocytopenia ? </p>
<ol>
<li>The first mentioned table also informed us of a 25 year old male that had life threatening complications from the vaccine during the clinical trials. CVST, thrombocytopenia, positive for the anti body PF4 test. </li>
</ol>
<p>The same “Characteristics” slide I mentioned above states that all cases occurred in white females? Either someone fucked the entire PowerPoint up or I’m confusing myself. </p>
<ol>
<li>When I went on the VAERS website to look up the ID #’s of the patients given, the website shows completely different time to onset days for every case that was shown in the table. Ex. VAERS showed 6 days   Vs. the table in the presentation shows 11 days. </li>
</ol>
<p>How could they possibly screw that up so much?</p>
<ol>
<li>The 5th patient in the table has “extensive DVTs” as the serious adverse event. It doesn’t mention a CVST like every other case does as that is the clot the meeting is for. </li>
</ol>
<p>But when asked if the company had data regarding clots other than CVSTs like DVTs, PEs, etc. with or without thrombocytopenia, the answer was “we did not focus on that” </p>
<p>Well first off, how can your vaccine be causing a fatal cerebral venous sinus thrombosis but you don’t look into REGULAR clots? Besides even that, THE FIRST TABLE literally showed a patient with a DVT as one of the 6 cases??? Without a mention of CVST??? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>First table states 1 case had obesity as a pre-existing condition. The “characteristics” table states obesity was in 3 cases. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The “7 million shots” and “6 cases” argument is so asinine. Out of the 7.2 million doses to date, there have been only 1.5 mil doses to 19-50 year old women (the current vulnerable population). First of all, the “6 cases” data comes from events that have already occurred. The thrombotic events happen 6-13 days post vax, therefore we only have data prior to March 30th. How many vaccines were administered then? Only 3.5 million (48% of doses). Out of the 3.5 mil how many were the targeted population? And how many new cases will come from the 52% of doses after March 30th? </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I know this isn’t even ground breaking shit, I just don’t understand how a massive company has so many hiccups like that. How no one in the CDC/ACIP caught any of that. </p>
<p>Someone help I’m going insane</p></p>

        <p>There have been two vaccines the media and our esteemed medical professionals were willing to attack. AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Both have been attacked using blood clots as the reason. This isn't a coincidence. </p>
<p>Pfizer and Moderna will be the only ones allowed to succeed. They are controlled by the same people responsible for the entire pandemic con we are being subjected to. They are supported by huge investors. And, they are MRNA drugs. The MRNA drugs are the key to the entire operation.</p>
<p>I honestly believe the blood clot story is part of the con. I don't think J&amp;J, AstraZeneca or any other drug maker is meant to finish the race. I think their participation was needed to make it appear as though all the people, begging to be vaccinated, had various options. Maybe produce some drugs here at the beginning but, that's about it. You'll notice, Merck didn't participate. They knew how this was going to play out and how big of a disaster it's going to end up being. They didn't play along. </p>
<p>So, it's either my theory or those directing traffic don't want any competition messing up their MRNA plan. They want as many, as humanly possible, injected with the MRNA drugs. They are clearly willing to risk making even more people hesitant to get drugged up, to make sure it happens.</p>

        <p>As you are a person with a pharmaceutical background, I wanted to ask you, do you think that there is enough data provided by the producers of the vaccines at this moment to prove that they are lowering the ability to infect other people after being vaccinated? I have very big doubts in that, especially after news coming from Israel but would be nice to get the opinion from someone more experienced. I see for now a lot of inconsistencies and mistakes which they try to hide and a lot of marketing instead of real data to prove that these vaccines are working.</p>

        <p>The only reason why the number of people infected can lower is because of “herd immunity”. The vaccines are relatively efficacious in providing your own body immunity, but substantial data does not exist in regards to transmitting it to another person. It is still possible to transmit covid as a fully vaccinated person. It is possible to get covid yourself as a fully vaccinated person! The data just isn’t there</p>

        <p>I also think that there is not enough data but people on the pro vaccine group use this research to prove it. What do you think about that? Personally I cannot understand while this is interpreted as a proof for vaccine efficiency and in the same time the deaths or serious side effects are dismissed as caused by vaccine....

        <p>They even had a case of CVT during the clinical trial in a 25 year old male who got the vaccine (out of 22,000 people). They just blew it off said it wasn’t related to the vaccine. PE was twice as likely in the vaccine group. I don’t understand why anyone thought this was ok. Then they just give this thing to 7 million mostly young people.</p>
<p>Like why do the clinical trial if you are going to straight up ignore serious adverse events?</p>
