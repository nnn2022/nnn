    <strong>I’m scared to move Down Under because of their extreme lockdowns and rules.</strong>
    <p><p>My husband grew up in the middle of fucking nowhere Australia. He lived on his parents’ cattle ranch until he was 16 and they moved here. It’s only been four years but his parents are moving back and he wants to go. Because of covid, I need to go. I won’t have a place to live soon since my lease is ending (that was going to happen regardless of covid) and things aren’t good here. I’m pregnant so I need a place to live and I need to stick with my husband. His parents are having another house built on their ranch close to their house so we have a place to live and have enough space for our twins. I’m a first time mom so having covid and moving internationally isn’t a good addition. </p>
<p>The things Australia is doing are seriously scaring me. I’ve done research and it’s really only in the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, and New South Wales. I’m going to be living in Northern Territory. I should avoid most of the bullshit if I fly into Perth in Western Australia and we drive to the ranch, but I’ll still have to quarantine in a hotel for like two weeks. After that I can go to the Jeep dealer, pick up my new Jeep truck and start the days long drive. </p>
<p>I mean, I read they can forcibly take your fucking kids from you. I’m probably giving birth there. That’s terrifying. I’ll either have a doctor come out to the ranch and give birth at home or I’ll go into the nearest big town on a set induction date so I can be in a hospital. I’m assuming they don’t enforce that bullshit in such a rural area because they didn’t enforce the firearms ban there. His parents still have all their guns staying with someone down there. </p>
<p>But seriously, it’s scary. I’m going to spend the least amount of time possible in Perth and big cities. I’m scared about birth, what if they decide to take my twins from me? It’s evil. I’m so protective over my twins and they’re not even born yet. The forced quarantine for citizens is scary too. They can just decide to take you away from your home and family and you’re just supposed to accept it. I’m scared.</p></p>

        <p>I wouldn’t move. That’s just me though. I’d probably try to find a job in South Dakota or some other state without a mask mandate. They can’t discriminate against hiring you because you’re pregnant. My mom worked full time up until the day I was born and I think it was good for me, I’ve always had a tremendously strong work ethic. I would never have kids somewhere they could get taken from me like how things are in Australia. Also, I’d be so afraid of being stranded there if the marriage didn’t work out.</p>

        <p>Yeah it seems that Australia is the guinea pig for these Orwellian tactics. </p>
<p>But truthfully, no country is safe right now except Sweden and Asian countries.</p>
<p>I think this election will decide what happens next. If trump can dismantle this bs, other counties will have no excuse but to follow suit.</p>

        <p>The US and Australia have had a very similar history but for some reason they don’t have that same fight we in the US do. I’m originally from South Africa but I’ve lived in the US my whole life. We left because white Africans weren’t being treated right the black Africans were saying you have 48 hours to pack up all your stuff and leave before we kill you. Because of that I don’t like to accept being told what to do by government.</p>

        <p>If you were moving to a city, I would say do not come. Don't risk it. However, out there in the NT not in a city? You'll be fine! Perfectly fine so long as your husband has income of course. It's a different world out there, my mum's closest friend lives on a property outside a small town in the NT and life has been NORMAL there. I am in NSW and don't live in a city, but in a large I guess urban area it might be called idk. People were acting normally here the entire time, largely didn't follow restrictions, even most shops stayed open. The police here ignored people blatantly flaunting the restrictions, both businesses and individuals. Ignored massive gatherings, ignored parties right in front of them. Cops dealing with a case I'm a victim in told me they didn't give a damn about the rules.</p>
<p>My friend just gave birth in the hell that is Melbourne. Straight to skin on skin with her newborn. I've heard of new mum's been seperated from their newborns in America, that has not happened here. Mother-baby separation has actually been happening in the USA, not here. Your baby will NOT be taken from you and there WOULD be horror and an outcry if they tried to - one private hospital made mention of separation right at the start when people were most hysterical and instantly backtracked and apologised people they got slaughtered. Yet it was accepted in the USA which shocked me.</p>
<p><strong>Your baby will NOT be taken away</strong></p>
<p>The "forcibly take your kids" thing is in South Australia and is very unlikely to happen. Just as there's those guidelines to do so in the UK, but it hasn't happened. You'll be out on a property. All hell would break loose if they actually did so I would say. But you are going to be in the NT on a property - you would be fine.</p>

        <p>I’ll be about six or seven hours out from Alice Springs. We of course have to fly into a city but after our 14 day quarantine we’re getting the hell out. I’ve never liked cities but with this I really don’t want to stay in one. We’ve been thinking about flying to a separate country first then flying to Perth where restrictions aren’t as bad.</p>

        <p>Good idea. Just stay away from the city and I am sure you and your family will be sheltered from anything they come up with. Good luck with the arrival of your baby :)</p>

        <p>Hey, I'm from Melbourne but I've lived in and visited most of Australia, including Northern Territory/Darwin. If you have any questions about anything in particular, reply to this comment and I'll answer.</p>
<p>I also have parents who live in a small town at the top of WA - the vibe/culture is somewhat similar to the laid-back, "remote culture" of a lot of the Northern Territory. And for my parents, COVID basically hasn't even existed - no masks, no craziness, nobody socially distanced. They basically didn't give a shit about the virus. (But I don't know if that would change if they had an outbreak of COVID).</p>
<p>Northern Territory - you will <em>probably</em> be safe. It's very remote, not many people, and they haven't really locked down. That said, I can't promise that'll stay the case if they get an outbreak.</p>
<p>But even if they do, the Northern Territory is REALLY remote. Like, more remote than you can imagine. There's a lot of bushland around, and a lot of small towns you could retreat to. Or if you guys are living on his parent's ranch (we call them "stations" here, not ranches), you should be absolutely fine.</p>
<p>I know the news looks scary, I know shit in Melbourne in particular is REALLY bad (I've written a tonne about it) - but Northern Territory is pretty much business as usual and has been the entire year. They only had <strong>34 cases EVER</strong> - and all recovered perfectly fine. COVID basically doesn't exist there.</p>
<p>Source:  <a href="https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/current-status">https://coronavirus.nt.gov.au/current-status</a></p>
<p>Here's the current restrictions (there's barely any - basically just "please try and socially-distance"):</p>

        <p>Non-citizens can leave whenever they want. Not sure about her husband since he's Australian but the fact he was living overseas for years means this hasn't been his primary place of residence so he could probably leave. You are allowed to leave to <em>move</em> permanently overseas. </p>
<p>Uh it's sad to even have this conversation, we should be able to leave no matter what.</p>

        <p>Thanks for clarification. I’m just chilled by any attempts to prevent anyone to leave a country’s borders. And I would fear they would change the rules again and maybe include other groups (like non citizens - or is there some international law against that, because it’s false imprisonment??). I admit I may be overreacting and the OP would be good to not listen to my hysteric ramblings 😂</p>

        <p>I am beyond angry and beyond unnerved that I cannot leave and was refused my applications for compassionate grounds. As was my mum. We are dual citizens!!! </p>
<p>I don't think it's truly legal and probably a human rights breach to hold us captive. Even the state borders is probably not legal. They could never hold non citizens all hell would break loose, it already is starting to break for holding citizens and dual citizens who live here.</p>
<p>Whole thing is fucked, totally fucked. But would not apply to the OP or her husband espeically if he could show he was moving away.</p>
