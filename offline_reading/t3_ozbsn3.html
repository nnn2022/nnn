    <strong>Where the fuck is the common sense???!</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone else hate the sentiment "the CDC lifted their mask guidelines too early and this is why delta is bad"? Cause I've seen this asinine statement around (unironically).</p>
<p>That makes absolutely no sense because mask wearing was still extremely high back when COVID was at its absolute worst, that being December 2020 ---&rt; January 2021 with very few vaccines rolled out at the time, and cases absolutely exploded despite the mask wearing, so what the fuck is with people saying the CDC was wrong? If anything, the masks barely did a dent! They're blaming the wrong thing, evident by the fact that some places remained open with very little restrictions and still did not suffer.</p>
<p>In fact, CDC were CORRECT back in May 2021 to finally stop the mask theatre and wrong in July 2021 to now suddenly freak out about the delta scaremongering as if it were a game changer (and with very lousy data, may I add, even CNN and MSNBC <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/breakthrough-cases-cdc-analysis/index.html">criticized the CDC for their faulty data</a>, so thats saying something when even CNN of all news networks is not happy).</p>
<p>Like do they not have access to the same data we do?!? How can anyone continue to justify any mitigation requirements whatsoever for this virus in its current form? If delta were a brand new virus and we had this level of immunity already present in the population and it was killing/hospitalizing this few people no one, and I mean no one would be talking about masks, lockdowns, distancing. No one would care. People are just programmed to be terrified of covid now no matter what. They‚Äôre all chasing this unrealistic zero covid strategy that is literally NEVER going to happen. </p>
<p>But sure, your shitty "masks" are gonna help THIS time, amirite? ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°</p>
<p><strong>The only time "ZERO covid" would've EVER been possible is when you lock down extremely hard in November/December 2019, NOT March 2020 when it was already around the globe (and even that is not a guarantee!) and wearing 3 masks, 4 masks, 5 masks is NOT going to change that fact!!</strong></p></p>

        <p>They are willingly indoctrinated. Common sense has left the building.</p>
<p>These are the same people who think surgical masks stop aerosols. That believe which way you enter or exit an aisle effects Covid risks. The ones who supported a 10pm curfew because COVID comes out at night.</p>
<p>These are the same people who will have 10 vaccinated people test positive and will blame the one unvaccinated guy who tested negative as the source of their infection.</p>

        <p>Exactly. It literally doesn't make sense, even when I try turning off my brain, its like a siren screaming at your face about the security theatre being bullshit. Hard to ignore unless you willingly shut your ears and eyes. </p>
<p>Truly amazing, I guess this line from 1984 applies:</p>
<p><em>"The party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command."</em></p>

        <p>People want the illusion of safety, my friend.  A person can be intelligent and wise.  They can be thoughtful and sane, but put a few hundred together, and they are just one sheep in a flock.  </p>
<p>The mask idiocy is just one part of it.  They recommended masks because COVID wasn‚Äôt an airborne virus. Double ply cotton masks do nothing to protect against an airborne virus, because it will just slip through.  They said it was caused by respiratory droplets‚Ä¶. So wear a mask.   In October of 2020, the CDC admitted what anyone with half a brain already knew‚Ä¶ it is an airborne virus‚Ä¶.. but they kept the masks to keep people feeling safe, and to keep from
Admitting they were completely wrong about them. </p>
<p>The vaccine is failing.  It is not protecting as good as it appeared to (or the companies reported it) protected in a lab. 74% of people in the Massachusetts outbreak were vaccinated, 74.8% of people in Mass are fully vaccinated.   The ‚Äú95% protection‚Äù stuff will be dropped soon and they will recommend boosters every 6 months then every 3 months unless they come up with a new vaccine.</p>
