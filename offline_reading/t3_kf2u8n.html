<title>Has anyone had an argument with a knowledgeable, self-aware doomer? Like someone who doesn't sound like a bot and has logical, data-driven arguments? Every ideology has at least some knowledgable people even if they are misguided.</title>

    <strong>Has anyone had an argument with a knowledgeable, self-aware doomer? Like someone who doesn't sound like a bot and has logical, data-driven arguments? Every ideology has at least some knowledgable people even if they are misguided.</strong>
    <p><p>If so, I am very jealous, and I would like to know where those conversations can be made, and how the conversations went. I have only seen the same 2 things repeated over and over again. Which are like, idek... "if people followed the rules the pandemic would be over" maybe if that counts? And "listen to the experts" if you consider that a specific argument? That's about it. Maybe something about hospitals filling, with no comparison to prior years. The only data point I have been referred to is the CDC's virus death count, nothing of specific data supporting lockdowns. </p>
<p>And OF COURSE, no comment on the human cost of lockdowns, or something about the human costs not being as bad a dying, bc the roves of children becoming child prostitutes to make money for their families that lost everything in lockdown are at least not dead. Have you seen a doomer show normal human empathy in your discussions? </p>
<p>I have had many political discussions on the economy, social issues, foreign policy with people from all sides, and many times even when I disagree the person has specific data points, or something noble they are fighting for, like the poor or children. But idk where those people are now bc every conversation with a doomer now sounds like a bot. I worked on a lot of arguments against lockdowns but they feel pointless to share with people who think differently since no one can have a coherent discussion about it. It's ok to disagree with me but please I really want an intellectual discussion. Do you guys have any luck?</p></p>

        <p>This is a great point.  Every (theoretically) intelligent person I've talked to about this has broken down to hysteria when confronted with the facts.</p>

        <p>Even the honest people who are bots are going to be reluctant to present or discuss data because they sub-consciously know that they have nothing to back their opinions and they don't want to risk the cognitive dissonance. However, I've found some success by baiting people into presenting their own data first and then countering with mine. Honestly it helps if you act a bit dumb and uncertain of yourself (maybe throw in a few intentional spelling or grammar mistakes) so that they feel you will be an easy target. </p>
<p>They will usually take a look at what you offer after that because you've established the parameters of the conversation as being: let's discuss data.</p>

        <p>Done this a few times, always goes the same way. I keep throwing data at them to counter any point they bring up or any data that they come at me with. Their arguments get weaker and weaker until finally they just suddenly disappear from the thread. Importantly, I can tell from their responses that they are actually looking at the data I'm giving them.</p>
<p>Sometimes, but not normally, I actually get people to make some small concessions (but never to admit that they are entirely wrong, as you would expect). I had two different people finally say something along the lines of</p>
<p>&rt; well maybe Sweden does have the virus under control but they are a very wealthy country with excellent health care and ... blah blah blah excuses excuses, more weak excuses</p>
<p>Sometimes, after a long discussion thread where they have been arguing with other posters for literally hours, I bait them into a discussion about data and after they hit me with their first (weak) data set I counter with my own and then they <em>immediately</em> disappear. </p>
<p>But always, eventually, they up and disappear.</p>

        <p>No. Even the ‘smart’ individuals I debate with refer to CDC directories as if what the CDC says is completely honest and truthful.</p>
<p>They are willing to disregard the THOUSANDS of scientists and doctors being suppressed online for what Fauci and the CDC say.</p>

        <p>What really hurts is that the only CDC data they even use is "300k people died", there isn't even anything else they can use to support their argument. Ofc the CDC number is wrong but even if it wasn't they have no data to support whether lockdowns helped make that number lower that it wouldn't have been (not even discussing whether it would be worth it if lockdowns did save idk like a life or 2 given their human cost). WHERE IS THE DATA!!!</p>
