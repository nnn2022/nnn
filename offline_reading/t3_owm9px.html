    <strong>I seriously need to rant! I don't understand the "do your research" argument.</strong>
    <p><p>The most LAZY and IGNORANT argument for those who are pro-covid-vaxx is "do your research". As if we haven't! Apparently they do not understand that true scientists are showing why all of this is concerning. We are given CONSTANT data that contradicts itself from BOTH SIDES. Bottom line, there has to be SOLID evidence that this vaxx is safe...and there just isn't. Period. End of story!</p></p>

        <p>My friend i somehow start to be affraid.  </p>
<p>I spent countless hours studying government datas, looking at raw datas. I spent countless hours going to government websites to make statistics. I spent countless hours gathering serious articles.  </p>
<p>Every single time I present them I get called an idiot. They say i'm spreading misinformation. When the informations i'm spreading are from governments websites.  </p>
<p>I show them the proof, I show them raw datas. Numbers they can't dismiss. And yet, they call me a liar. They never dismiss my sources and datas. Thay are always using feelings.   </p>
<p>It's like people were convinced it is a certain way and even presented with proofs that it isn't this certain way, they can't admit it. Because it would mean they were manipulated.  </p>
<p>People don't seek the truth anymore. They believe in something.</p>

<p>I use to get angry at them, but now it feels like maybe the sleepers have some kind of mental impairment?? </p>

        <p>hey, if it isn't a bother, could you share some of the raw data links please? i'm trying to gather info from both sides, but the pro vaccine side is easier to get info from, and i wanna see the issue from both perspectives</p>

        <p>And they rotate in and out of government agencies as well.</p>
<p>Also agree with the religious overtones.  It's a failure of the education system, especially higher ed.  Most students can obtain a bachelor's degree without ever engaging with conflicting sources, evaluating claims, and synthesizing an argument.  It's a game of spitting back what you're told after being convinced by being shown "sources" that only lead to one conclusion.  </p>
<p>So they believe that there is only one side to every argument-the one spoonfed to them by authority figures.  Everything else, they've been instructed comes from some evil place, and these heretics must be shut up and cancelled, just like happens in the university.  they're intellectually crippled and unable to think rationally, but believe themselves educated because they've got the worthless credential that they were convinced to borrow 6 figures to buy.</p>

<p>If anything most of us were expecting the vaccine side effects to be worse than they were. </p>
<p>Most of us know that we have to evaluate the people in office before trusting them. Very little trust for the prior government. And it showed. One of the tasks of the Biden administration was calling every link of the vaccine supply chain to see where the vaccines actually went. Because when the first 30 million was distributed, less than 8 million doses were actually administered. </p>
<p>Turns out most of the health agencies were suspicious of the federal government, and were hoarding vaccine doses. In some places there were 2 doses being held back for every dose administered because it was so uncoordinated.</p>

        <p>The issue is they haven’t done their research. They heard one side and said “good enough for me”, whereas, we have looked at data from all sides and made a personal risk to benefit calculation. That calculation for me indicates that the jabs aren’t worth it, especially since the long term data for them is still unknown.</p>

        <p>You have to admit, For some of the anti-vax people some of the logic for not getting the vaccine is outright stupid misuse of data. I suspect it is more about getting a rise out of people than solving any problem.  </p>
<p>Second there really is a Russian propaganda machine making posts encouraging people to distrust vaccines and covid science. The goal is to disrupt western economies. Some of the source material posted here is from that effort. </p>

        <p>We look at numbers.  Math doesn't lie. My healthy 5 year old child doesn't need to wear a mask outside or in the pool. Most pro-covid-vaxxers are that extreme. We all had Covid, we did fine (other than my oldest having diarrhea). We stay clear of older people, who are the majority of those who die from it. We respect everyone else's decisions for their health and we ask they respect ours. You being vaccinated is not going to keep you from getting or giving covid, so why do you care if I get vaccinated? My covid is not going to be any different than the covid you could still get and give. </p>
<p>Also, "flattening the curve" just means to slow the virus down...it won't go away by closing small businesses, kicking kids out of school and making people homeless. 
That's just a fact. </p>
<p>"Heard immunity" comes from either vaccinations or naturally. But vaccinations don't take 3 hours to create...or even 6 months. My family is fully vaccinated except for covid, only my mom is. She has lost 19 lbs in two weeks and barely remembers who she is most days. That was enough for me to "just say no". </p>
<p>I was taught in D.A.R.E that at some point in my life, people would come from everywhere to give me poisons and to "just say no". </p>
<p>I listen to Drs like John Ioannidis who is one of the most published, respected and influential physician scientists in the world. He also has a Nobel prize. He's not an idiot checking YouTube and neither am I. </p>

        <p>You are arguing one thing. I'm pointing out that some of the logic on this forum is why you are getting grief. </p>
<p>For instance the main theme of this post is false:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/owda90/what_part_of_the_vaccine_doesnt_prevent/">What part of "the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission" do you not understand?</a></p>
<p>It has been demonstrated many many times that people who are visibly sick spread the infection 20x the rate of an asymptomatic person. That asymptomatic people who are vaxed or not vaxed have equal viral load doesn't change that. </p>
<p>What the vaccine has done is sharply reduced the number of visibly sick covid infections among the vaccinated. That reduces the number of new infections.</p>

        <p>First, I don't speak for all of Reddit. </p>
<p>Second, you can't be so blind to see how skewed the numbers have been since the beginning of this whole thing. They keep changing the rules on testing...that does not equate continuous, accurate data. It just doesn't. </p>

        <p>100%, some who share my view point are outright stupid. But that does not change the reasoning I used to arrive at my conclusion. And that reasoning is based upon me reading a plethora research papers in full length.</p>
<p>The mere existence of propaganda also does not diminish the validity of said data. To find a suitable allegory, think of the time of Copernicus. There were anti-church propagandists who tried to break the church's monopoly on inheritance and trade by advocating for a heliocentric worldview. Doesn't make Copernicus wrong because other people had 'bad' intentions.</p>
<p>I don't want to convince you of anything. I encourage everyone to do their own research and speak to their primary health care professionals in order to make sound choices regarding their own health. I'm here to explore different viewpoints that might alter mine, to have fun and rant from time to time.</p>
<p>Btw I appreciate you being civil and thinking through the different options and arriving at your own conclusions. Such interactions serve to enrich the discussion and make this sub, and subsequently the worlds of its readers a better place.</p>

        <p>Yep! It's the same frustration I'm having. When u look at both sides of this, it's so polar opposing its scary. And that's why I do not trust the Vax atm. It's not good enough to have politicians saying it's safe when Vaers is getting nonstop reports of injuries. </p>
<p>I mean honestly, how does this NOT concern ppl when they "do their research" ... ?</p>
