    <strong>Anti-Mask At The Forefront of MSM's Declaration of "Culture War" After Anticipated Debate</strong>
    <p><p>"During <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/live-debate-trump-biden-fact-check-211141243.html">the presidential debate on Tuesday</a>, President Trump mocked Joe Biden for frequently wearing a mask as he answered a question about downplaying the effectiveness of wearing a face covering to prevent the spread of COVID-19."</p>
<p>They are associating us with Trump in this narrative.</p>
<p>Heavy Brigading on the same day. Coincidence?</p></p>

        <p>Let them. We aren’t alone. They doubt the noise level coming from people like us. Many are keeping it to themselves out of fear of confrontation and will be using their voice when voting privately and anonymously. The constant demonization of even saying we just don’t like them is not going to do them favors.</p>

        <p>The truth is Biden is sick. I find it strange democrats are going with a known sick person as a rep, in an election within this scamdemic fiasco. </p>
<p>It just doesn't make sense to vote for a sick person and expecting that somehow he will make you healthy. I never understood why they didn't go with RFK Jr. I guess big pharma funds democrats these days.</p>

        <p>I wish Trump would have more directly criticized the flip-flopping and attacked masks directly instead of his mealy-mouthed "I have no problem with masks" and then making fun of Joe. I also wish he would have pushed harder on Pelosi, Schumer, Lightfoot, and other mask-obsessed Democrats for getting caught breaking their own rules.</p>

        <p>I don't understand why we're being called Trump supporters. If Trump is on our side then why hasn't he declared mask mandates and lockdowns unconstitutional? Why did he let the country fall apart over a bunch of lies? Not that Biden is any better, saying Trump should have done more to stop covid. The only person I've ever wanted to be president was Ron Paul. He's speaking out against the corona virus hoax, doing what he can. Ron Paul wouldn't have sold us out. Trump certainly did. So don't call me a Trump supporter. I hate them both equally.</p>

        <p>Hey I was/am a Ron Paul supporter too! I totally agree about Trump and not wanting to be lumped in with him. I was just saying that is what the MSM narrative is currently. I agree they couldn't pull this shit on Ron Paul who is actually a decent physician. Personally I think they would have tried to assassinate him if he ever got into office. He would have cut all "AID" especially to the fraudulent government occupying Palestine.</p>

        <p>lmao please, please educate yourself. </p>
<p>Masks have NEVER been proven effective. Every quality attempt to do so (through proper RCTs) has found NO effectiveness. This was widely known and openly accepted in the scientific communities (until a few months ago). </p>
<p>Hospitals around the world regularly question the use of masks due to the known lack of evidence. Some have loosened restrictions based on that. They all keep them in some form - explicitly because masks sure seem like they should work, and therefore patients and even medical professionals simply feel better with them. </p>
<p>Educate yourself. It’s easy if you care to do so. Check out the many peer reviewed rcts and systematic reviews by highly qualified researchers at reputable institutions.</p>

        <p>I’m a lawyer, graduated from a top ten law school. What’s your level of education? </p>
<p>I get my information from qualified scientists - you can too!</p>
<p>The trick is to look at MORE than a single study. </p>
<p>You can make a study that shows whatever you want.</p>
<p>You can cherry pick a study that shows whatever you want. </p>
<p>When evaluating the evidence, you must consider ALL of the relevant evidence in order to determine the best-supported conclusion. (Scientists do this in systematic reviews using far more rigorous analysis.) </p>
<p>The overwhelming weight of the available evidence to date shows that masks do not have any proven effectiveness. If we acquire additional evidence showing otherwise, then the conclusion will change accordingly. But as it stands, the totality of available scientific evidence supports my conclusion. </p>
<p>Again, please educate yourself. I understand that ad hominem attacks are super fun and make you feel superior, but they’re not logically sound.</p>

        <p>How dare you include ALL relevant information regarding the subject matter! What are trying to do, be logical?!! Where is your self righteousness?! You are supposed to shout over the opposition with accusations of carelessness and you are only supposed to cite studies that you agree with, and be sure <strong>NOT</strong> to thoroughly read them. Gloss over key words such as, <strong>likely</strong>, <strong>suggest</strong>, <strong>may</strong>, and <strong>possible</strong>. You know what? Ignore those words completely and in your mind replace them with <strong>clearly</strong>, <strong>proven</strong>, and <strong>irrefutable</strong>. I hope you enjoyed your reeducation, you should be eternally grateful, for it comes from Lord Fauci, the savior of 'Merica' !</p>

        <p>What makes me a hypocrite?</p>
<p>You’re the one who raised the issue of education level. Education is not intelligence, and formal education is not required to be educated. </p>
<p>I’m not going to do your research for you. Frankly, I’ve had this discussion many times and provided this research many times.... you can scroll through my comment history if you’d like. Or you can find the exact same research yourself with some googling. </p>
<p>If you care about making educated decisions, then you will do your research. I don’t care what you choose. </p>
<p>Pro tip: not all studies are created equal. If you choose to educate yourself, note the method each study uses. RCTs and systematic reviews are the gold standard. Case studies, lab simulations, and retrospectives are evidence but only very weak evidence. Studies that show no effectiveness are the former type; studies that show effectiveness are of the latter type.</p>

        <p>Sigh </p>
<p>A mask worn properly is either effective at blocking particles that come out of your face holes or it is not. </p>
<p>A mask that effectively blocks particles from your face holes while you cut open a patient will effectively block particles from your face holes while you sit a desk. </p>
<p>Surgical studies are the best evidence of true efficacy. </p>
<p>Normal people who wear masks in public do so poorly: they touch the mask, pull it down to scratch their face, take it off and replace it (e.g., for a meal at a restaurant) wear it for excessively long periods, reuse it ... terrible mask hygiene. </p>
<p>Sure, some people will wear masks properly in daily life all of the time. But most do not even come close - you can confirm this yourself just by watching people wear masks for a little while. </p>
<p>Surgeons in an operating room are using masks under ideal mask conditions: they are rigorously trained in behaviors for proper hygiene (it takes a lot of effort to not touch your face at all for prolonged periods) working in a sterile setting. </p>
<p>If masks don’t work to prevent transmission in <strong>optimal mask conditions</strong>, it is ludicrous to expect them to perform better in shitty mask conditions that are applicable to normal people using them in every day life. </p>
<p>But here, you like “experts.” <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">Here are some experts - specifically in respiratory illness and infections - explaining why mask mandates are unsupported by evidence. </a></p>
<p>Science is a process - not a set of immutable truths. The proper way to evaluate evidence is to work from the evidence to a conclusion; conclusions follow evidence, not the other way around. </p>
<p>But you clearly are interested only in confirming your conclusion. You will be able to give yourself many reasons why evidence that does not say what you want it to say isn’t “real” or “valid” - they won’t be logically sound reasons, but you’ll feel they are very compelling because they serve your purposes. </p>
<p>An evidenced-based position does not rely upon <em>ignoring</em> contrary evidence - rather, it fully considers all evidence and weights it in accordance with accepted scientific methods. </p>
<p>Wear a mask if you like. Tell yourself the science is settled that masks are proven effective at preventing transmission when used by the general population in daily life. Tell yourself whatever you like, and believe whatever you’re told.... but your belief doesn’t make it true. </p>
<p>Have a good day!</p>

        <p>Why are you so angry? Is it because you can’t formulate a rational, evidence-based response? </p>
<p>You raised the issue of education, not me. </p>
<p>I provided you with a study, which you inappropriately dismissed - the logical response to the study I shared involves raising specific objections to its method/conclusion, and requesting additional evidence (again, no individual study is compelling, it’s the total weight of the evidence that matters). Even if you have valid objections to that study, that doesn’t disprove anything I’ve said - because one study doesn’t matter either way. If you were interested in evidence, you would have asked about what other studies are available. </p>
<p>I then provided you with an article written by highly qualified experts. </p>
<p>Instead of addressing that, or anything else, you come back with this angry word salad. Why? </p>
<p>I never said I’m witty or clever. I also never said you’re dumb (although you’re doing a good job convincing me). I’ve addressed you with the expectation that you are an intelligent and reasonable person, despite your open hostility and insults. </p>

<p>That’s not proof. If true, it’s correlation: these two things happen together. Correlation does not prove causation. </p>

<p>My odds of dying from covid are negligible, as are yours. Please see the current cdc data on IFR, which tells us, of all the people who actually get infected (tested or not), what percentage of them die. This is the best estimate of individual risk that covid will kill you if infected. </p>

        <p>This is still correlation, not causation. But let’s ignore that. </p>
<p>What makes you say that anti-maskers increased? </p>
<p>Just because your awareness (or media coverage) of opposition to masks has increased doesn’t mean that more people have in fact stopped wearing masks. </p>
<p>Do you have any data on the percentage of population in the us (or in specific cities) that doesn’t wear masks in public? </p>
<p>I am opposed to mask mandates yet I typically comply. Many places like CA and NYC have extremely strong enforcement and very high compliance. </p>
<p>Is there somewhere specific where people have stopped wearing masks? Have you personally observed in your own city a marked reduction in mask compliance?</p>

        <p>Hey I know you think I'm a r-slur. But can you read this and let me know what you think. Help me figure out new things. </p>
<p>If we had masked up and locked down say in January the curve would be flatter. Which means less deaths up until this point. </p>
<p>The virus can't be eradicated, that's a fact. So if we had masked up and locked down earlier we would unfortunately be under even HARDER lockdowns NOW because the pressure to keep cases suppressed would require that. </p>
<p>So the 200,000 deaths would be coming later. Unless we stayed lockdown harder than we are now for years until everyone can be vaccinated. But that might only be x% effective as stated by Fauci who said we would need to continue to mask and social distance after vaccine arrives. So say 4 years down the line we might have say 50,000 deaths and stay somewhat locked down to keep them from rising.</p>

        <p>The reason why trump is associated with your movement is because his previous statements before the debate were an anti mask rhetoric. Also you are seriously jerking yourself off, if the government really gave a shit, which trust me they dont, this sub would of been banned before it had a chance to even grow. Think at least three steps ahead next time</p>
