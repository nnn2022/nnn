        <p>Sorry, some random <strong>pediatrician</strong> in Texas who claims she's an "expert in vaccines" because she's administered them before is somehow an authority? This is on the same level of the Kraken lawsuit witnesses. Just pluck random charlatans out of the ether to testify whatever idiocy they can make up. My local CVS pharmacist has also given thousands of vaccines to people, that doesn't mean she's an expert in vaccines.</p>
<p>All three major vaccines were tested on animals, and the animals did not die. You can read their peer reviewed journal articles here and see for yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1070-6</li>
<li>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03275-y</li>
<li>https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2024671</li>
</ul>
<p>They were also tested on human blood specimens and demonstrated effectiveness there too, with no negative effects observed. They were then tested on voluntary human subjects (tens of thousands of them), again with no negative effects observed. All of which are requirements for the FDA to approve emergency authorization for a vaccine.</p>

        <p>No adverse side effects were observed at the date of publication in September. The FDA (seemingly unintentionally) released a draft surveillance list of possible side effects in October which several have already been confirmed and had warnings officially attached.</p>
<p>- Myocarditis/pericarditis </p>
<p>- Guillain-Barr√© syndrome</p>
<p>- Thrombosis </p>
<p>- Thrombocytopenia</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The claim that animals were killed in the trial is unverifiable for sure but adverse effects are being observed after the study. Her being a pediatrician is relevant in regards to the video as she was advocating against the use in children as the trials being conducted have yet to be concluded.</p>

        <p>When you realize that every medication carries these small risks...it's almost like the CDC is <em>monitoring</em> for spikes in these types of issues.</p>
<p>Besides, the animal tests where they died were from the SARS vaccine, <em>not</em> COVID-19. Further development was halted because we stopped needing the vaccine when the virus burned out on its own (low infectivity rate and tendency to kill its hosts).</p>

        <p>This "expert worship" has to stop. Every major crisis -- war, financial, whatever -- is propagated by "experts."</p>
<p>Secondly, this idea that "tens of thousands" of humans were tested "with no negative effects observed." Is just absurd.</p>
<p>I know too many people first-hand who have had side effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>long term shortness of breath (probably due to clotting in the lungs)</li>
<li>fainting on the site right after the injection</li>
<li>collapsing for hours on the floor after returning home from second shot</li>
<li>bad sickness for 1-4 days after the shot</li>
</ul>
<p>It's so bad the company I work for decided to give everyone who gets the shot two days off, to recover.</p>
<p>What kind of vaccine requires recovery time like that?! That's not normal.</p>
<p>So just from what I've seen firsthand in the less intelligent, less aware people around me -- there's no way they tested on "tens of thousands" with no negative side effects.</p>

        <p>Complete and utter bullshit. The only common result of the vaccine is flu-like symptoms for a few days. Fainting? Give me a break. You don't even seem to know the basic fact that they make you wait 20-30 minutes after receiving the vaccine so they can monitor you for anaphylaxis.</p>

        <p>If this were a serious thing that happened and not something you heard third-hand and are hyping up for your own benefit (or more likely, inventing), you would have the name of some kind of syndrome that a doctor hypothesized might've caused the issues, not that they merely "collapsed". </p>
<p>Like, anxiety-induced syncope is a real thing that happens with any medical intervention involving syringes (some people are afraid of shots) and blood (some people are afraid of blood). But perhaps you don't mention that because it has nothing to do with symptoms of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Regardless, close to 1 billion people across the globe have gotten at least one shot at this point, and the number of <em>actual</em> unexpected symptoms reported is so minute as to be not worth mentioning.</p>

        <p>Did you not think for a second that anything you considered vague on my part was maybe because I felt a little weird discussing a family member's medical issues online?</p>
<p>As far as "inventing" --- what do you think this is?! Do you think we're here for some kind of fun "reddit debating" or some other silly nonsense? Maybe you do that, I mean -- you're trolling here obviously...</p>
<p>But no, we're here because we've all had our lives turned upside down thanks to the active or passive support of people like yourself and we don't want to go along with it.</p>
<p>And the worst thing about people like you is forever making excuses for your constantly moving goalposts and damage you've done to people's lives. The incredible selfishness of locking down healthy people and forcing experimental injections on people.</p>
<p>And then to come here and accuse someone of making that up? If I was going to make something up wouldn't it at least be more interesting than a collapse after injection -- which they obviously have that waiting-period after for...</p>
<p>And then my father in law. It's not the most eventful story in the world, but it happened.</p>
<p>But that's the point. People didn't collapse after flu shots. And at my work, the side effects were so bad that they gave everyone two days off for getting the shot, and if you're still out they'll work with you on additional PTO until you recover.</p>
<p>That's not normal.</p>
<p>But what's also not normal is for someone like you to come in a so rudely make a claim like that, but it makes sense given everything else you supported.</p>
<p>More than likely you know what I'm saying is true and in the back of your mind you're a little worried about the long term side effects. Good luck with that.</p>

        <p>It's always a risk vs reward. There's no magic number of years of testing after which a vaccine (or any medical intervention) becomes 100% safe. Some medications were on the market for decades before being recalled by the FDA, even after the standard requisite testing period.</p>
<p>But even in those cases where vaccines or other interventions led to deaths and were recalled, literally nothing matches up to the scope of the deaths caused by COVID. So the reward for accelerating the release of the vaccine, based on past experience, far outweighs the risk.</p>
<p>And if you are afraid of "experimental therapies" such as the mRNA vaccine, there's always the traditional Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine which uses the traditional vaccine technology.</p>

        <p>To see the things they bring up youve got to do a ct scan. They just happened to omit these from the study because there is localized lymph node swelling after vaccination, which is normal, but if they bothered to do them during the safety studies they would have caught the heart inflammation cases.  Ill start with a simple source where you can at least understand the relationship between CT scans and inflammation. https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/health/covid-vaccine-lymph-nodes.html</p>

        <p>I agree. Any kind of immune response those are the first to go. For me usually its the ones in my armpits and it sucks because ive got these big lumps in my oits and they hurt. Heart inflammation is a different story, and if they bothered to CT scan the trial participants this would have been noticed a lot sooner. The nanolipids are traveling and mrna expression isnt isolated to the arm muscle tissue. This is why we are seeing all the adverse affects. If the vaccine was isolated to muscle tissue and lymph response I wouldnt be so weary.</p>

        <p>I'm not claiming that there are definitely no side effects for anyone. Of course there are for some people (although it seems to be rare). But every medical intervention has side effects for some people. That's not a reason not to recommend the average person not to use the medical intervention, especially when the risk of not doing it is quite a bit higher than doing nothing at all.</p>

        <p>Oh ffs ! I thought to myself some people will see that and still say it‚Äôs not real . When you work in and around a certain field for decades you do learn a lot and pick up extra knowledge from experience.<br>
It isn‚Äôt a vaccine either .  You need to wake up !!</p>

        <p>Tens of thousands with no negative side effects but when they start giving it to the general public all kinds of side effects pop up? I'm not even trying to argue how severe they are, jury is still out on a lot of them but you seriously can't think there are no negative side effects.  Maybe the risk is worth it to you, that's fine it's your choice but go to the covidvaccinated sub and take a look, and they are generally pro vaccine.</p>

<p>Statistically, I'm really not surprised. When you scale into the millions, there's bound to be problems that no amount of clinical trials or testing will ever catch.</p>

        <p>Literally hundreds of millions of people have the vaccine, and there are less than a thousand people with severe side effects, and maybe a handful where it's plausible the vaccine had lethal complications. Your odds of dying from COVID-19 are several hundred thousand times higher than dying from the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Yeah you're right. We're only allowed to worry about one problem at a time. And it has to be the ones that practically require a World Government to solve, rather than ones that are easily solvable by spending 10 minutes getting a vaccine shot.</p>
