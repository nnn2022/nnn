    <strong>Genuinely curious / advice question</strong>
    <p><p>First I wanted to say I really appreciate this forum, it has helped me feel less alone (or crazy) with my feelings on how the current world situation is being propagandaâ€™d (if that is a word?!) by the media / government and big pharma. 
Spreading fear and dividing people by shaming them for having autonomy over their own bodies etc.</p>
<p>Personally I have a strong sense of unease about accepting an experimental agent into my (otherwise healthy mid-30â€™s) body etc. and am noticing via some conversations how isolating that can feel amongst friends and colleagues who are fully engaged with the narrative of following the leader / being vaxed is only way and if you donâ€™t you â€˜are killing peopleâ€™ etc.</p>
<p>But I digress. I wanted to know how others on here may handle the following situation despite beliefs as above.</p>
<p>Receiving a notification (via app) of being in close contact with someone who has tested positive, and being required by government to self-isolate for 7 days.</p>
<p>This has just happened to me, and although I stand by what Iâ€™ve said before I must admit some feelings on unease if I donâ€™t follow said guidance and continue to go about my life now  ( no matter how slim chances are) </p>
<p>I think itâ€™s more a moral thing that because Iâ€™ve been notified I feel I should stay home etc. I donâ€™t want to be feeling on edge or passing something accidentally to very old or sick people I guess, that seems not great.</p>
<p>Interestingly my friend who is due to come visit and stay with me all this weekend said they are still fine to visit me, and happy to socialize / go out to dinner as planned etc.</p>
<p>Genuinely curious if people here (this forum /sub) feel strongly about totally living normally and allowing what may be (I.e ignoring the hysteria over covid) or if there would be some of you who despite not wanting vaccine/ lack of trust the government etc. would still stay home for the isolation 7 days out of courtesy to those around them?</p>
<p>I should add I am awaiting a test tomorrow (please donâ€™t lynch me for having test! I think with potential friend visit (if I do go ahead) I should know the result either way)</p>
<p>Open to thoughts,  im not sure if Iâ€™m brainwashing myself with the hysteria of the app and exposure etc. 
be gentle if poss feeling confused</p></p>

        <p>PCR testing is a joke, it only tests for parts of things not infections.  It will likely return a positive, it will be wrong, but prepare for that.  If you can avoid testing you should.</p>
<p>The "virus" has never been found/isolated in any unvaccinated person, ever.  As in never ever. It's a giant load of horse excrement.</p>
<p>You shouldn't feel isolated or sad for being intelligent.  You should however feel very sad for all the people around you who jumped in and got the "vax" without question.   It has very real and documented consequences.  It is also something that is undoable.  Those people will have to live with the repercussions of their decision for the rest of their lives (assuming it doesn't straight up kill them of course).</p>

        <p>I understand your unease and confusion so much. I get moments like this too. I think you're just trying to do the right thing. It's so difficult to know what the right thing is sometimes... I never downloaded the app and I'm glad I didn't as this moral dilemma happened to a few friends who did. I took the vaccines and will be getting tested to go abroad. I'm now having similar unease, worrying I'll be doing the wrong thing by travelling with these new 'variants' around, but I figure I just have to go. We can't keep shutting our lives down forever. I would probably advise you do the same. It's time we started using our brains and our common sense again.</p>

        <p>I hear you on that first point, but I think my point is, it's confusing to get so many messages. Of course you can't spread what you don't have but they tell you to act like you have it. I'm aware this is crazy, but we're struggling with the messaging versus our common sense I think.
On the second point, I completely agree.
On the third point, I'm aware of what psychosis is, this is not psychosis. This is confusion because of mixed messaging. I'd argue if you're not confused at this stage you're probably insane! ðŸ˜‚</p>

        <p>'psychosis' is when one loses touch with reality by seeing or imagining things that are not there, like this 'covid' (SARS2) that the OP clearly does not have. </p>
<p>i am not confused and i am not insane. :) the OP is between both of them</p>

        <p>A collective psychosis of society, perhaps - an interesting idea. I think it's more like munchausen syndrome or munchasen by proxy as govt definitely engaging in coercive abuse of their citizens at this stage. I think OP is just confused, not insane, and I understand why anyone would be. Not all are completely awake to this, and even some of us who are have days we waver and question whether we are correct in our thinking.</p>

        <p>there is no 'collective', the collective is only an abstraction. in reality, there are only individual men, women and children. there can be no 'collective psychosis' only individual psychosis in a great number of people.</p>
<p>i don't waver in my thinking, i scrutinize every piece of info the same way in order to reason out the truth or falsity things.</p>
<p>my thinking does not get scrambled by words such as 'could', 'can', 'may', might', 'maybe' and others which remove thought from reality and into the realm of mere possibility and fantasy. </p>
<p>i am impervious to the equally thought scrambling hazard of possessive and  collective possessive pronouns such as 'my', 'our' and 'we'. for example, when people say 'my governor' or 'our' government', or 'our team', as if they personally own, possess or control them, they have lost touch with reality because they do not.</p>
<p>fortunately for me, i was not 'socialized'. i was taught how to think critically and to always question everything. i know the difference between logic and sophistry.</p>
<p>the problem with people like the hapless OP is their ability to critically think has been atrophied via indoctrination and conformity passing itself off as education in their formidable early years</p>
<p>here is a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/x6XRShM.png">handy guide to critical thinking</a> for those who want don't know what it entails</p>

        <p>I agree with you on most of the above. 
However, I do tend to believe in the Jungian idea of the collective unconscious myself. You may also have heard of folie a deux, a psychiatric condition where collective psychosis is possible. Feelings tend to be very contagious societally. </p>
<p>I agree, language is extremely important, most people are not aware of the NLP aspect or the subtleties of it. Once you are it's an eye opener. </p>
<p>I don't think any of us are impervious to brainwashing and behavioural training, not completely. You probably brush your teeth every morning and say things your parents said at one time, or believe certain things you were once told. We are all fallible and similar in this way. More similar than different I believe. The concept of trust cannot be ignored here either. We are hardwired to trust, it helps us developmentally and societally for the positive. We have layers of trust. Eg. I might trust you not to kill me but do I trust you not to tell my secrets? Without trust, we'd have no social or family cohesion. I think the problem comes when those we are meant to be able to trust are untrustworthy, leaving us confused. It can be seen in children suffering abuse (Disorganised Attachment style).</p>

        <p>heh, ideas are only ideas. i look to reality, nature tells no lies.</p>
<p>what you describe as a collective psychosis and feelings being contagious parallels the 'need to belong' in the hierarchy of needs, which plays out as mirroring rather than some sort of collective thinking. fads are good example of this. incentives play a large role in this, the main incentives being the gain of reward or the even stronger avoidance of 'pain'</p>
<p>feelz ain't realz, as feelings have no outward existence of their own. i do give credence that thoughts are things (wavelengths or vibrations) and are transferred between people who are 'tuned in' to the same wavelengths.</p>
<p>i have much xp with NLP, having stumbled across it in the early 90s when i started my long career in outside sales. i put a lot of time into understanding it. modalities, sub modalities, tone, context, framing etc.. my eyes are wide open and have been for decades </p>
<p>as for trust, that is like respect (setting aside respecting people's right to be left alone), in that it must be earned. there is a minimal level of trust i afford to my fellow men, which increase or decrease based on their actions.</p>
<p>that said  i do not trust the agents, minions and enforcers of the lying thieving murderous state, they have given me no reason to trust them at all and every reason to not trust them by their actions. so called experts are wrong a lot and they do not pay for their errors, they are irresponsible, similar to the agents, minions and enforcers of the state which they are often funded, connected, etc.</p>
<p>i give no credence to 'untended consequences', especially in politics and 'policy'. if it happens, you can be sure that it was planned that way.</p>
<p>&rt; I think the problem comes when those we are meant to be able to trust are untrustworthy, leaving us confused. </p>
<p>this is the crux of the OP's situation, he puts his trust in the untrustworthy.</p>

        <p>Firstly, if your government is <em>requiring</em> you to isolate for 7 days, I completely understand the conviction to stay home. Shoving it to the virus likely isnâ€™t worth legal ramifications. </p>
<p>Morally speaking, youâ€™re not responsible for the natural course of a virus. The elderly and sick have the vaccine and all other precautions available to them if they need it. Otherwise, the likelihood of you 1) asymptomatically spreading the virus, and 2) someone actually dying from the virus, is extremely small. Weâ€™ve never treated other illnesses this way, weâ€™ve never blamed ourselves or others when 35,000 people died from the flu in previous years. This is no different, especially now that thereâ€™s a vaccine for the vulnerable. </p>
<p>Obviously, if you have symptoms, then stay home. But otherwise, no, personally I wouldnâ€™t isolate. I took a COVID test once because I had symptoms and second-hand exposure to a positive case, but the test still came back negative. Thereâ€™s no way of knowing if the person you had close contact with actually even has covid, or if they have a regular cold with inactivated covid rna still in their system from a time they previously caught it and maybe didnâ€™t know it.</p>
