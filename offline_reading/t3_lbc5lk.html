    <strong>So....they were lying before.</strong>
    <p><p>This was buried as the 2nd half of a story in my state.</p>
<p>“DHEC has changed the way it reports the percentage of positive tests. The number is now calculated by dividing all positive COVID-19 tests by the total number of all COVID-19 tests and multiplying the result by 100.</p>
<p>Previously, DHEC calculated the percentage of positive tests using a “people over people” method.</p>
<p>“It is important that people understand that while percent positive appears as a smaller number under the new way of calculating the rate, COVID-19 continues to spread at an elevated level in our state,” said State Epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell. “That smaller number is solely based on the change in the way we calculate the rate.”</p>
<p>The agency said the public will notice a big drop in the percent positive number with the change. But that does not mean the level of spread in the community has decreased.”</p></p>

        <p>Still lying because COVID-19 tests are completely unreliable.  And if they fix that, they will still lie about something else</p>

        <p>Previously, DHEC had been calculating percent positive using the people-over-tests method. That required dividing the number of people with positive results by the number of people who had taken tests overall, which included positive and negative results.</p>
<p>DHEC decided to use this method early in the pandemic because the focus was on identifying new people who were testing positive. This becomes harder to do when much of the population has been tested. With the continued recommendation for South Carolinians to be tested frequently, the shift from people to tests also becomes a more effective method to monitor active cases.</p>
