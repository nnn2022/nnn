    <strong>Easy Ivermectin activism option</strong>
    <p><p>Adam Gaertner (<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/veryvirology">https://mobile.twitter.com/veryvirology</a>) is Ivermectin activist for past 12+ months, and as all of us, is not making huge progress.</p>
<p>I think as a brilliant outside-the-box solution he made Ivermectin crypto coin. Now, this is definitely not investment advice, I'm just bring this to general attention.</p>
<p>The purpose and intention of the coin is to provide funds to promote Ivermectin awareness.</p>
<p>This is how I think about it: In the worst case it is a scam, but still, it's him who benefits, and that is still in a way a good outcome. If you look at his track record, he is trying really hard, with causes aligning well with NNN. In the case that the coin is not a scam, some of the partnership wallets can be used to fund Ivm-awareness in various projects, for example FLCCC. In the best case, also the value of coin goes up significantly, as lot of people may think this is a good cause. Also, if the coin does very well, that alone is enough to bring a lot of publicity to the cause.</p></p>
