    <strong>To Those Who Don't Understand The Significance of Mask Wearing Mandates Inside Private Homes And Laugh And Say They Can't be Enforced</strong>
    <p><p>Once upon a time there was a brutal and ruthless king that had restricted lives of his citizens to a point where his throne was at the risk of being overthrown. There were daily riots and people were fed up with their lives as a result of being oppressed so much and having virtually no rights. </p>
<p>The highly intelligent king that he was, he called upon his ministers and told them to write into law that effective immediately farting is illegal whether in private residences or in public. </p>
<p>The baffled ministers couldn't believe the king, and said: Your majesty, all other laws and rules that you've made to control and restrict these peasants are perfectly enforceable and we can easily arrest and prosecute those disobeying them, but how can we possibly enforce your majesty's rule on farting in private residences?</p>
<p>The king smiled and said: That is the whole point!</p>
<p>The law went into effect and the messengers made all people all over the country aware that there would be harsh consequences if they farted even in their homes. </p>
<p>After less than a month all the riots had stopped and people were happier than ever. They were farting as much as they could and laughing at the king telling each other that they were once again free and there was nothing the brutal king could do about it. They felt they had defeated the king by breaking his rule, and as a result were highly satisfied with their daily rule breaking activities!</p>
<p>The throne was saved and the otherwise horribly oppressed people lived happily ever after.</p></p>

        <p>So the point is that they were happy they could break the unenforceable rule even though all the other oppressive rules still applied? I get it.</p>

        <p>Those other oppressive rules didn't seem so bad when there was an illusion of freedom. After all they could fart inside their homes easily even though it was illegal! They had won, and the king had been defeated, they felt!</p>

        <p>It's funny how I remembered something so distant in the past the moment I read the "news" about private home mask mandates and reading people's comments laughing at the idea because they couldn't be enforced.</p>

        <p>I think this has some weight. But also consider that having unenforceable laws that no one respect lowers the respect for the rule of law in general.</p>
