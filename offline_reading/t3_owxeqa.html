    <strong>The beauty of compassion</strong>
    <p><p>At the risk of this sounding like virtue signaling it's not at all, I'm sharing you with this because all we see lately are depressing bad things and sometimes it's up to us to take action or make a move that will put some good back out into this shitty world. We do have the power to do that and we need to actively use it at this time. I am in New York City, in other words a dystopian nightmare full of people that have been hammered into a permanent state of fear and OCD panic.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was out this past weekend running errands and I came back to my neighborhood and I was walking home from the subway. I'm in Queens to be exact. A very busy neighborhood full of lots of young rule-followers. There seems to be little to no independent thought where I am.</p>
<p>As I was walking down the street I could see in the distance something in the middle of the sidewalk and people walking and stepping over it. One guy was walking his dog and just kept going, several couples kept walking and people on their own were passing whatever it was too.</p>
<p>Eventually I got closer and I could see it was a man laying on the sidewalk. He was completely shit-faced. So drunk that he was unable to keep his eyes open or respond. He was moving around, I called out to him but he wasn't able to answer he just opened his eyes and looked at me and rolled over. He was wearing a mask that was pulled down under his chin. I could feel his pain while I was looking at him. All I could think of was what kind of things has this man suffered through that he is at this point in life? He is likely somebody's brother, somebody's son, somebody's father , somebody's friend. Maybe he has a good heart, maybe he has a great sense of humor, maybe he's good at fixing things, maybe he's a good cook, maybe he's very smart, maybe he's a good writer, who knows who he really is. But here he is completely vulnerable sprawled out on the sidewalk with people stepping over him like he's a piece of worthless garbage. Not a single person stopped.</p>
<p>I bent down and I held his hand and I asked him if he was able to get up but he was totally unable to do that. So I called 911 and I asked for help. I waited with him and I said soothing words to him to try to calm him down. A sweet young woman walking her dog came by and asked if there was anything she could do to help and I told her no I had already called 911. She told me she was so happy to see someone who stopped and cared about this man because so few people do things like this now. We had a nice conversation and I told her I've lived here for a long time and I'm really not happy with this current crop of people living here now. She agreed.</p>
<p>The ambulance came and the EMS people got out, a guy and a girl. They were super nice they took his vitals and they were asking me questions and I gave them two chocolate bars out of my shopping bag as a thank you.</p>
<p>Connecting with another human being like this was such a special feeling. I felt like I fulfilled my purpose at that moment. I can't recommend enough trying to help someone you see in need. Even if it's just saying something nice and paying a compliment because whether you realize it or not, we are all in need right now. </p>
<p>This is something I have done for years and I still do it. If I am in the grocery store I will compliment my cashier, have a nice discussion try to break up the monotony of their day. I know everyone that works in my local small grocery store I have even been to the dance recital of one of the checkout girls. This has made such a difference in my life. </p>
<p>If you can, try to find one person tomorrow, someone you encounter in your daily routine and pay them a compliment. Thank them for helping you. Tell them they have a nice laugh, tell them you like their shirt. Anything to lift someone up and I promise it will make you feel better. Can you imagine what things would be like thousands of people started doing this? We have really lost this over the last couple of years and we need to actively get it back. Our humanity has been taken away and we need to reclaim it before we lose even more.</p></p>

        <p>This is a virtuous act, and a beautiful one at that.
In a world full of people who wouldn’t bat an eye in that man’s direction, be proud that you are willing to make a difference. Good on you.</p>

        <p>I used to get to do this daily, human interaction. I work in home health care and I used to visit people and give them therapy in neighborhoods all over the city. I absolutely love it. It was my life. I spent my days in people's houses helping them get well. I miss this so much. I am a person who loves other people which is why it's so hard to see what's happening in this world right now. Most of my life and my whole career has been spent trying to make a difference in people's lives. I will go to my grave still trying to do this in any little way I can, it is honestly like putting gasoline in my tank. I can't live without it.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much for saying that! I feel that it's not even about me it's about the bigger picture, people are losing the ability to see one another as human and it's sad. We need to start viewing each other as people, not as germs!</p>

        <p>Yes, we aren’t germs and we aren’t politics. People are seeing labels and making assumptions, not seeing the human soul in each other.</p>
