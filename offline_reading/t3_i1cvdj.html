    <strong>Not living just existing</strong>
    <p><p>Just echoing a sentiment I've read a lot lately. I'm trying to find ways to live how I used to without restrictions/lockdown/hysteria infiltrating my daily activities. I'm on my own, and although I don't get lonely, I used to enjoy going out into the city (even on my own) and even if it's to browse a shop or get a coffee, I liked being around people. I'm spending time watching movies and listening to music and trying to feel how I used to before 2020. Admittedly, I may be more optimistic than I should be, but I don't see the hysteria lasting into next year. I never liked people as a whole before, and right now I keep my own thoughts to myself. I'm fortunate in that I don't have any friends and the only people I talk to are my parents (who I can talk about anything and are not judgemental). But I've read a lot of posts on different subreddits about people falling out with their own family members over political ideologies, masks, etc. etc. I know I'd be preaching to the choir, but it makes me sad to think that people just seem to be giving into their impulses, triggered by media fear mongering, politicians, rules, I don't know. Also I have to repeat a mantra to myself when I go out so that I don't get desensitized to everything that's going on. And I have to remind myself that there's people out there who feel the same way I do, but you can't do anything and I hate that my fate seems to be in the hands of powers beyond my control.</p></p>
