<p>2018 - 2.8+ million died</p>
<p>2019 - 2.8+ million died</p>
<p>2020 - YDT - 2.533 million have died with just over a month to go...Looks like were right on pace for the average</p>

<p>Also curious how we have a pandemic during a cycle whereby the UN has projected US death rates to skyrocket for the next 50 years (excluding COVID as it clearly states) </p>
<p><a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate">https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate</a></p>
<p>This would mean to achieve there goal of excess deaths, over the next 1.33 months, they will need a wopping 600k + deaths</p>
<p>lol You see they need an end of year spike, becasue they don't have the "excess" deaths to account for, so if you don't have em you gotta make em..</p>
<p>You people are nuts! good luck</p>

        <p>Hey, I made a post like this a while ago and someone else pointed out the same mistake I made. The COVID-19 CDC page only shows total deaths from 2/1-today. You need to add the number for January in there from the provisional page, so we end up around 2.7-2.8 right now.</p>

        <p>Good point! And you are right..Add 264k to the 2.53 and we are at 2.8..
So I will concede on the death toll overage, however, this is why they still need the boost end of year becasue many of those deaths which would have been spread out over the remaining months have already happened. Additionally the UN projections indicate that the US is on an upswing in annual expected deaths and in fact is projected that the US was already on pace for 2.95 million deaths in 2020, which is equivalent to the 1990 death rates. Additionally if we look back at 1968 when the H3N2 hit the death rate in the for that year was equivalent to 3,175,614 deaths by todays population.. And it was referred to as a "Bad Flu Season"</p>
<p>Did they lock down and mask up the world? Factoring in that these measures have 0 effect on stopping a virus, and will only very slightly slow it's progress at best, and based on it's alleged infectiousness, realistically the people have already been exposed. This is what makes Sweden a joke, it took 9 months of spreading without any measures to finally catch up to them...Seems a little beyond the stated incubation period.</p>
<p>https://www.biospace.com/article/the-1968-pandemic-strain-h3n2-persists-will-covid-19-/</p>
<p>https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate</p>
<p>So measuring excess deaths also needs too be measured against former similar examples, so under the Bad Flu year definition, unless the  US exceeds 3.2 million deaths, they are on target.</p>

        <p>Exactly! and guess what? 2020 was expected to be a bumper year as part of the incline, therefore based on predictions, even if there are excess deaths it can be accounted for in their projections ...We're supposed to have more excess deaths now and in the coming future.</p>

        <p>Now have many of those 2020 deaths thus far were from preventable suicides and drug overdoses, by people who couldn’t handle lockdown, lost their businesses, livelihoods, relationships, jobs, etc.?</p>

        <p>I was being a smartass, but as far as I know, nobody knows the exact number. I wasn't aware 300k was the number, but I'm sure they padded some of those numbers with deaths that were a "consequence of the pandemic," i.e. people who had heart attacks because they refused/were denied health service due to the lockdown. And why wouldn't they want to pad the numbers? It helps put fear in people.</p>

        <p>Well, it's not designed for the layperson, but imo it's not that bad.</p>
<p>They are offering different ways to look at the same numbers, since quantifying death is more complicated than simply "died of covid," "died of pneumonia" etc, since multiple diagnoses can be involved with a death. The codes (J09 etc) are shorthand for the diagnoses.</p>

        <p>Many people conflate Communism with authoritarianism, disregarding the many different flavors of government/corporate overreach. Collectivism, colonialism, expansionism, globalism, imperialism, and interventionism are all manifestations of the same sociopolitical rot. Socialism vs capitalism is a false dichotomy for the plebs, and this COVID issue - like so many other issues - is far beyond left vs right. Or USA vs CCP, for those who think the dear ol' American elite are simply unwitting victims of icky Chinese machinations.</p>

<p>I wonder how many people die with some influenza virus in them?</p>
<p>Not died "OF" influenza, but there was some strands of influenza in them when they died.</p>
<p>I wonder how many people that would be?</p>
<p>But I guess to find out we would need to do a massive testing campaign looking for anybody who had some strands of influenza in them, and then we could count any of those people who died afterwards .. because the influenza probably had something to do with it.</p>

        <p>It seems you're not the one getting it. How long do you think people should live? How many people do you think should be alive at any given time? Is there any upper limit, or do you seek immortality and unlimited population growth? Do you not understand the need for death? The inevitability? Is sheer quantity of years lived so much more important than quality of life?</p>

        <p>The same individuals could have died from some other infection (viral, bacterial, fungal), or anything else related to their age and health state since the vast majority were elderly with multiple serious chronic conditions. </p>
<p>Excess dementia deaths have already been happening and will continue thanks to policies you support. Just one example. Other deaths related to declines in health in the elderly you're pretending to protect. My great uncle being one of them and he was killed by choice, which is worse than him getting a virus and dying.</p>
<p>The virus exists. Deaths were inevitable and it will kill people each year from now on just as other respiratory viruses including "common cold" viruses do.</p>

        <p>Cherry pick data much? This is exactly the sort of behaviour that climate change deniers engage in.</p>
<p>If people on this forum were honest with data then they would look at the following from the CDC on excess mortality see this year: "Overall, an estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred from late January through October 3, 2020, with 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed to COVID-19. The largest percentage increases were seen among adults aged 25–44 years and among Hispanic or Latino persons." (1)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate">https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate</a></p>
<p>This would mean to achieve there goal of excess deaths, over the next 1.33 months, they will need a wopping 600k + deaths</p>
<p>lol You see they need an end of year spike, becasue they don't have the "excess" deaths to account for, so if you don't have em you gotta make em..</p>

        <p>Their comment wasn't relevant though, yours was in response to them but theirs trying to disprove the screenshot as incorrect for October in England wasn't. They were claiming the above was cherry picked data for October (that roughly 43,000 died and also did in 2019 which is true) and linked to the CDC in America to prove it. The numbers didn't come from the American CDC so their argument was moot.</p>

<p>So yes a significant excess deaths per month in 2020</p>
<p>Doing a like for like comparison between datasets 1 and 2 for 2020 you see dataset 1 giving a total of 1.626M deaths for that reported period and dataset 2 giving 1.391M deaths for the same period. This means you can't do a like for like as these are obviously two different datasets that have been extracted in a different manner so your numbers are bullshit. </p>
<p>Within dataset 1, this is what it looks like - https://imgur.com/a/qe8hVnC Pretty obvious.</p>

        <p>I don't have any links saved for you but you can. One of the best redpills is articles about the 2018 flu season from 2018, because they show that it's all estimated bullshit anyway. The official numbers posted on the CDC for 2018 now show it way lower than it did in 2018, when the reporters were checking it for data. One article I recall reading even says specifically "and while the estimate may change, the CDC does not expect it to go down."</p>
<p>Of course now that we're here in COVID times and everyone is supposed to be pissing their pants in fear, somehow the estimates for 2018 have been retroactively changed to be smaller than all the reporters said in 2018. Funny, huh? I wonder if, two years from now, all the COVID estimated deaths will get a similar treatment.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2018/09/26/cdc-us-flu-deaths-winter/">2018 news article:</a></p>
<p>&rt; NEW YORK — An estimated 80,000 Americans died of flu and its complications last winter — the disease’s highest death toll in at least four decades. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; CDC officials do not have exact counts of how many people die from flu  each year. Flu is so common that not all flu cases are reported, and flu  is not always listed on death certificates. So the CDC uses statistical  models, which are periodically revised, to make estimates. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; CDC officials called the 80,000 figure preliminary, and it may be slightly revised. But they said <strong>it is not expected to go down.</strong> </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 2020, when we check the CDC's data for 2018 flu deaths, they tell us that only 61,000 people died from the flu in 2018. That's quite a large revision, from 80,000 to 60,000. </p>
<p>And is there any proof that the CDC changed its numbers and it wasn't just this journalist misreporting? There sure is. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018/archive.htm">Archived link to the CDC's 2018 flu data.</a> You may note that at the top it says the "updated preliminary numbers" have been changed. However, reading through the document, in 2018 you will see that when they originally wrote it they were quite confident in the 80,000+ deaths figure. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So there you have it. Good luck with your redpilling endeavors. Why the CDC feels the need to tell us there were 80,000 deaths in 2018 and then revise that "estimate" down to 60,000 after the fact I have no idea. Do they have any idea how many people die? Do they have an agenda? Up to you to decide.</p>

        <p>Copy and paste from a former post that made this clarification.</p>
<p>"Good point! And you are right..Add 264k to the 2.53 and we are at 2.8.. So I will concede on the death toll overage, however, this is why they still need the boost end of year becasue many of those deaths which would have been spread out over the remaining months have already happened. Additionally the UN projections indicate that the US is on an upswing in annual expected deaths and in fact is projected that the US was already on pace for 2.95 million deaths in 2020, which is equivalent to the 1990 death rates. Additionally if we look back at 1968 when the H3N2 hit the death rate in the for that year was equivalent to 3,175,614 deaths by todays population.. And it was referred to as a "Bad Flu Season"</p>
<p>Did they lock down and mask up the world? Factoring in that these measures have 0 effect on stopping a virus, and will only very slightly slow it's progress at best, and based on it's alleged infectiousness, realistically the people have already been exposed. This is what makes Sweden a joke, it took 9 months of spreading without any measures to finally catch up to them...Seems a little beyond the stated incubation period.</p>
<p>https://www.biospace.com/article/the-1968-pandemic-strain-h3n2-persists-will-covid-19-/</p>
<p>https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/death-rate</p>
<p>So measuring excess deaths also needs too be measured against former similar examples, so under the Bad Flu year definition, unless the US exceeds 3.2 million deaths, they are on target."</p>

        <p>You didn't address or concede any of my points. Do the datasets say what I said they say?</p>
<p>You are trying to leverage a single modelled data set as being a comprehensive view of the situation. You have a hypothesised number and are stating that since we are under that, this pandemic is not that bad. Excess mortality is a key indicator of a pandemic but not the only one but the graph I showed demonstrates the direct impact of COVID with those spikes of excess mortality correlating with infections.</p>
<p>Likewise, the world has moved on significantly from 1968 so expectations, treatments, travel patterns are very different from 50 years ago but H3N2 "only" killed 100k in the US in total while COVID has killed over 260k in 9 months even with better treatment, lockdowns and mask mandates. Even a linear extrapolation makes COVID 3.5x worse than H3N2 but it's highly unlikely to be merely linear due to the recent uptick in infections.</p>
<p>Likewise about cherry picking data, it is wrong to focus on a single dataset and claim that this is a scam. The incidence of COVID infections, the mortality attributed to COVID, the percentage of hospital ICU beds taken up in total and specifically by COVID patients all show a clear and serious danger to the population.</p>
<p>&rt;This is what makes Sweden a joke, it took 9 months of spreading without any measures to finally catch up to them...Seems a little beyond the stated incubation period.</p>
<p>Likewise your comment on Sweden not implementing as measures is just plan wrong. While Sweden did not implement a mandatory lockdown, they asked for a voluntary one which was evidenced by travel in Stockholm fell to 40 per cent of the normal level (1) and aggregate spending dropped by 25% and there were restrictions on gatherings of more than 50 people. So this has nothing to do with incubation periods and everything to do with epidemiology -  a subject that you have demonstrated you are entirely ignorant of. Likewise your comment that "realistically the people have already been exposed" is false as estimates are that only 20% of the population have been exposed when herd immunity requires 70% as a minimum. Another blatant falsehood from you.</p>
<p>In summary, you have answered nothing. The pandemic is not a scam nor a hoax as the OP claimed and to state that it is anything other than a life changing scenario is both false and dangerous.</p>

        <p>lol...Nice try with the "baffle with bullshit" approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>it's not about death toll it's about death rate, and we're seeing a similar death rate to that of 1968 a year with a Pandemic</li>
<li>Comparing numbers of deaths between 1968 to 2020 is nonsense. They did not change policies and procedures to ensure that people are declared a victim of the virus. Only in 2020 do you have terminal cancer patients being ruled a COVID death. Only 6% of people died without comorbities.</li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What treatments? - you mean killing people through the misuse of ventilators ...lol...There is no treatment for the virus other than eat well, exercise and fresh air, take care of the vulnerable by NOT placing infected patients into nursing homes, and let the virus spready and dilute itself among the healthy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Travel patterns - exactly, more proof that the virus has already spread today, making these "surges" more bullshit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks - dude this is so old, the science is clear on this and they don't work. Here.. Study shows that masks stop 50% of large particles and 10% of small particles from being expelled. Small particles make up 90% of the viral  particles expelled so if you exhale 100 particles, 5 large particles will be expelled and 82 small particles will expelled..So masks stop 13 out of 100 particles....pretty effective....lol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social distancing -  Virus's main source of transmission is through surface contact and aerosol's can travel 15 meters before landing. The Virus is recirculating in a closed system, that system is our atmosphere.. They're no escape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Show me a source for your "linear" extrapolation? I  would love to dissect that and put it to shame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your spewing bullshit with your MSM ICU bed claims..Hospitals are empty, staff is being let go.. And ICU units make up a minuscule percentage of the hospital and on any given normal day before COIVD, these units were always operating at capacity. This is simple economics, the cost to maintain vs the number of expected patients determines it's "size" year to year, so in a bad flu season, the demand will exceed the supply...holy fk...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are you reciting more MSM nonsense. Even if travel was reduced by 40%, and it somehow affected the slowing of the spread lol, the delay is perhaps a month at best, not 6 months..and spending wtf..25%..seriously, are you quoting this crap for real...So 75% of spending was still taking place and therefore 75% of consumers were out and about...This is not stopping or stalling the spread by 6 months. 50 people, wow, that's some serious virus control measures...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And your propagation, well, extrapolating the data lets see:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the deaths from the 1 st recorded death over the next 70 days to 23,195 based on a 2% death rate, the minimum number of infected would have been from 50 at day 1 to 1.6 million at day 70. At this rate over the next 40 days, 6.6 million would have died and 330,000,000 million people would have been infected, so the entirety of the US.. Based on timelines of lockdowns, and masking policies factoring in that even during this period the US was still quite active and non compliant, plus the active protests, any mitigation would have been minimal and perhaps extended the 40 days to 60 at best during this period. With the limited to no protection masks provide (stopping 50% of inhalation or expelling still results in exposure considering the eye is a great channel), coupled with the rule of exceptions (mask here but not there, distance here but not there) and transmission through surface contact followed by hands to face, again mitigation would have been highly limited and not nearly enough to prevent COVID from sweeping the nation at the onset of summer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Also do you even know how herd immunity needs to be achieved..You need to isolate the vulnerable and only the vulnerable, then allow the virus to sweep through the healthy population so it mutates,, until it mutates to the point where any virulence is diluted, at which point the at risk groups can be reintroduced to an otherwise benign strain so there immune systems can also develop the antibodies necessary for future infections. </li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, your perception of the data is false, "excess" deaths were and are anticipated among all age groups as it is well known that life expectancy before 2020 is dropping despite all your medical advancement nonsense and with the aging population the death rates themselves are going up, again without the intervention of said pandemic.</p>
<p>The only falsehood is the one that is making people believe that there's a deadly pandemic and wearing masks, social distancing and isolation are the cure. There's a virus, which realistically has already run it's course..Unless were dealing with a highly intelligent life form that we have mistaken for a virus lol..</p>
<p>So since COVID cannot account for the total excess deaths, why are these people dying..Oh wait, they won't release that data...</p>
<p>The MSM certainly has it's clutches into you since it's apparent you are just parroting what you've herd and read rather than actually dissect it yourself.</p>

        <p>I'm done with you. There is no amount of evidence I could provide you that would change your position. You obviously have no expertise or qualifications in medicine or epidemiology and your ignorance only reinforces what you think you know. Before I sign off, I'll leave with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not baffling with bullshit, it's giving empirical evidence for my position. It would have been great for you to link to evidence rather that just assert random bullshit</li>
<li>You don't understand what a co-morbidity is and what the 6% represents</li>
<li>You are wrong about no treatments as dexamethasone has been show to reduce mortality (1)</li>
<li>You are wrong about masks not working or reducing the emission of the virus (2)</li>
<li>You are wrong the surfaces are the main mode of transmission, as it's aerosols (3)</li>
<li>You are wrong in considering our atmosphere a closed system since the virus becomes non-viable after time in the air due to heat and humidity</li>
<li>Linear extrapolation is literally the term used to extend a line out past the data points, just as you would with average data per month</li>
<li>You don't understand herd immunity and evolution and Sweden has demonstrated that this approach is both too slow and too hazardous (4)</li>
<li>Your view that the MSM is somehow in a conspiracy shows your true colours. You refute everything you read that does not align to your world view. Your ignorance, incompetence and close mindedness makes you a perfect example of the Dunning-Kruger effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>I only hope that your behaviour does not endanger yourself or others. By all means, please bunker down and don't interact with the rest of the world. It must be a strange and scary place for you with its logic, rules and social contracts.</p>

        <p>1) The data shown is UK data not US data.
2) The figure that you have given is data for throughout the year, and I personally don't dispute the fact that COVID caused excess mortality back in the March/April peak. The post is showing excess deaths for October, as incredibly tight restrictions have been introduced in the UK during October and November to combat a "second wave" that is supposedly killing hundreds of people per day. However when you look at excess death in the UK, there is little evidence that mortality is any higher than it would be this time of year. Therefore it's not so much "cherry picking" data as using the data that is relevant to now. Deaths that happened in March shouldn't being influencing decisions in November.
3) Interesting observation from what you put. The percentage increase of deaths was highest amongst the 15-44 age ranges. Now these aren't people that are particularly susceptible to dying from COVID, the median age of death is something like 82 in the UK, and in the UK the number of COVID deaths of people under the age of 50 is a fraction of a percent of the total COVID deaths, so it would be interesting to see what is driving this excess death in this age group.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your careful and detailed post. As I posted in another comment for the UK "Excess deaths in England and Wales remain above the five year average, while deaths from covid-19 rose 40% last week, latest data show."</p>
<p>https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/deathsregisteredinenglandandwalesprovisionalweekending6november2020</p>
<p>It absolutely is cherry picking data since we are dealing with an illness with a prolonged incubation and deterioration period. Deaths are not immediate after infection so a single month does not tell the full tale especially since new infections only started spiking in the UK in late September. Likewise, while treatments have improved massively, especially usage of dexamethasone, mortality is not the only sequelae of this illness so just showing deaths does not give the true impact on the long term neurological, cardiovascular or pulmonary effects. Anecdotally, my cousin who is a doctor caught Covid 2 months ago and while he has avoided hospitalisation the post-covid pneumonia has meant that he cannot work and remains very ill.</p>
<p>Touting this post as clear evidence of the low impact of Covid is monumentally stupid for many reasons and if people want to have robust conversations on this topic, which I completely support, this sort of bullshit on how it is a scam is not how to go about it.</p>

<p>Considering that countries are (generally) growing, and the huge post-war baby-boomer demographic is now hitting end-of-life ..</p>
<p>Isnt it sensible to think that <em>every</em> year will have more people dying than the year before?   And every new year should <em>definitely</em> be higher than the &rt;average of the past 5 years&lt; which will be the average of a bunch of lower numbers.</p>

        <p>Yes. It's quite remarkable that we've been able to keep our infirm and elderly alive for so long, but we shouldn't be so surprised when they begin dying in droves. Or when the young and otherwise healthy begin dying in droves because of so much focus on keeping those infirm and elderly alive for as long as possible.</p>

        <p>The UK figures that you linked me to are really interesting. My biggest fear currently is the high number of excess deaths at home (997 week ending November 6th) compared with 520 in hospitals and 38 in carehomes. Also important to note that until 3 weeks ago there were no excess deaths in hospitals. These excess deaths at home overwhelmingly do not involve C-19, and I believe that they are a consequence of the lockdown, I suspect from people not accessing medical treatment.</p>
<p>The typical time period between infection and death is about a month, and as there are always outliers, these are in a minority. Deaths after a positive test in the UK are now plateauing, actually I believe they have decreased in the last seven day period. As with any disease, long term effects from C-19 are possible, however the incidence of long Covid is much much lower than the media may have us believe. Something like 2% of people infected are suffering symptoms 6 weeks after infection, and in the majority of cases it is mild. That being said my greatest sympathy to your cousin and I hope that they recover as quickly as possible. I hope after this pandemic we start taking post viral fatigue more seriously, it can be a debilitating condition that used to not be taken seriously, however was often not taken very seriously. I know about 15 people who have been infected and they all had mild symptoms and all recovered quickly. For this reason I try to avoid annecdotal evidence.</p>

America had 730,000 excess deaths over the last 5 years. Every single year at least 110,000. That's about 240 9/11s. Why didn't you speak up back then?</p>

        <p>What about the millions of people dying from mental health crisis during the lock downs. The people dying of exposure from losing their house because of Gov restrictions. All the children without food/shelter and the people that are trying their hardest to keep their house but can't find work because of this bullshit "virus". Every one that ik that got Covid is 100% fine it's not a virus u have to worth about. About 1/4 of the Covid deaths aren't actually from Covid</p>

        <p>Do you have sources for these claims? As in reputable articles or links to the raw data? Without doubt people have had it hard and many have suffered and there is definitely an element of the trolley problem on taking action against a pandemic but what your have posted smells like unsubstantiated Facebook bullshit.</p>

        <p>So that's a no, you don't have any evidence and you won't admit the validity of any evidence because everything has been tainted by those in power?</p>
<p>At what point do you take a look at your beliefs and think "am I reasonable in believing this?" If you are happy to post that "About 1/4 of the Covid deaths aren't actually from Covid" what gives you the confidence to believe this? It sure as hell isn't evidence or you would present it.</p>
