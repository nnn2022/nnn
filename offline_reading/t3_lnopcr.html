    <strong>Got sent home from work today/ Rant</strong>
    <p><p>Show up to work this morning and go through the “new normal”  way of entering the building this includes filling out a slip saying I understand all the LIES about COVID, there about 10 boxes to check after filling out my name and what I’m doing in the building.  </p>
<p>I then put my forehead to plexiglass for temp check then hand my slip to the attendant. After that I stand in front of infrared cam to confirm first temp check (I guess) </p>
<p>THEN I have to mask up and put some form of eye protection on usually safety glasses. As I’m walking through this process under my feet are sticky mats and boot sanitizing trays- to really sell the illusion or trap the virus from hitch hiking in on my boot, funny thing is the boot tray hasn’t had any solution In it for months so it’s mostly just a tripping hazard.</p>
<p>After THAT, I walk into my office and all the monitors have trash bags over them and all the monitors in our laboratory were covered as well, turns out someone tested positive yesterday so they had a company come in and spray the building with unknown chems, my desk, everything.</p>
<p>Took an hour being there for a director to come and tell us ( the remaining “essentials” about 90% of building is working remote since last March) to evacuate the building! For a better deep cleaning! </p>
<p>I was messing with my mask and now I have chemical burns on my face from whatever they covered everything in.... I’m done rant over.</p></p>

        <p>Been dealing with this clown show since July, it’s only getting more bizarre. </p>
<p>As I was walking out today I had my mask In my hand and a health and safety guy was walking in talking on the phone (important COVID containment matters) I’m sure, and tells me “you gotta wear a mask” it took everything not to laugh in his mask wearing face.</p>

        <p>Yep, that’s all it is.. we walk by a large open trash can by the entrance/exit that contains all used masks.. shouldn’t they be put in an incinerator immediately upon removal? If this is all a stage when do we all start throwing tomatoes?</p>

        <p>I started seeing how gullible the people were around me when “reality” tv started up and people thought some of it was real, I remember walking out of the first paranormal activity and hearing people that should know better saying it was real, same with the Blair witch maybe? I was too young when that came out.</p>

        <p>Even working at an assisted living fasility we have nowhere near that level of theater. We have the questionnaire once a week, temp check every day, and masks, we're also supposed to wear face shield but thankfully most people ignore that one. Resently there was an outbreak in a section of the building so now when ever we have to enter a residents room we have to gown up and that's seriously annoying and of course the disposable gowns are made in China where all this bs started. Also I would try to sue for those chemical burns.</p>

        <p>That’s something we joke about at work, why are we putting masks on that are made in the same place the “virus” originally came from, if they wanted to sprinkle anything in there and take out a large portion of the US population, they probably could, </p>
<p>If the reaction isn’t gone by tomorrow I would consider seeking counsel. I’ve snapped a few photos already. A guy I work with told me he used to have the job of going in and spraying buildings down after “contamination” and it’s a hydrogen peroxide/alcohol mix but idk what was sprayed in my building.</p>

        <p>That's truly insane. My job isn't that crazy, but it's still over the top. I haven't thought of that sticky paper for shoes in ages, not since we moved and left our positive/negative pressure rooms behind. We only used the sticky paper when entering the clean room before garbing up. They did enforce a new entrance with a temp scanner, but none of that covid question bs. I get enough of that when I drop off my kid for hybrid school. Our "covid" cleaners actually come in once a week and start an hour or two before we leave. The cleaning solution messes my sinuses up BAD. We're supposed to clean it ourselves twice a day with three different damn solutions, but nobody does it anymore. We stopped in the summer and honestly I never did it because I didn't have time. Forgot to add it's an office of less than 15 and the bulk of the cleaning is for the back room where only the same 1-3 people every go and we're completely closed to the public and always have been. </p>
<p>I am so over this shit!!!</p>

        <p>They say they are trying to keep us safe but being forced to wear PPE 40hrs a week (under threat of termination) that’s constricting on your head and causes tension headaches isn’t very safe or conducive to good health, I need a new job.</p>

        <p>I know those tension headaches well. We all experienced it when they started with masks AND face shields. I thought I had caught rona, til I took the shield off and my headache got better. I remember telling my boss THANK GOD I have a choice between the two, and he said NO, you have to wear both. I could not make it make sense. They stopped it after a few weeks. Even the masks became "only when you leave your desk and can't maintain six feet. </p>
<p>You definitely should look elsewhere. Enough is enough after awhile. Good luck!
My kid insisted on a trip to 7/11 on the way home. Somehow it was hot as hell in there and my mask was 10x more uncomfortable than usual. I don't know how people do it.</p>

        <p>I looked up any laws protecting workers regarding  them forcing you to wear things that cause detrimental impact to well being, pretty much if the workplace deems it necessary for safety your effed. Then it went on to say if your experiencing headaches it’s not due to mask it’s because maybe you aren’t getting enough water intake or caffeine withdrawals from not drinking as much due to mask wearing. </p>
<p>I make up for it now by just slacking as much and whenever possible, hiding out places where I can take my mask off for a little bit if I start feeling a headache coming on.</p>

        <p>It was the face shield causing the headaches. We all experienced it. Probably why they stopped enforcing them. I experienced it once with just a mask at the hair stylist. Probably because I wasn't getting the normal air flow I get. </p>
<p>This shit is just so unreal. I still reject it mentally and I think that's why I'm doing better than I was in April/May. I try not to dwell on it and hope it goes away. I'll worry again when I have to.</p>
