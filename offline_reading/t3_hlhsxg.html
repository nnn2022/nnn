        <p>Prove to me that wearing a mask "protects others".  Where's the  double blind study?  Are we talking about Covid-19 here only, which the head of emerging diseases for the World Health Organization says is transmitted extremely rarely from asymptomatic people?  Or are we talking about just the regular flu and colds we all get?  If the latter, why haven't we been told to wear a mask before?  If the former, again, cite your study.</p>
<p>Your meme is clever, except when people say they will fight for this Country they are talking about their freedoms, not fighting for reductions of them.</p>
<p>Finally, if you still fell this way, please tell everyone you know to stop driving an automobile, "to protect others".</p>

        <p>Same-ish.  30's, left leaning liberal-ish sort of independent voter. Voted Bernie before in primaries. Don't own a gun. Immigrant. </p>
<p>I find it really odd the MSM narrative of people who are questioning this tidal wave we are now caught in are being framed as "redneck Trumpers who own guns and are racist" because umm I'm a minority and I lived in cities my whole life though with all of this I am now considering moving into the middle of nowhere just to get away from all of it.</p>

        <p>I am in the odd place where I am a 20's left-leaning liberal who doesn't like either party and owns guns and is pro-second amendment and free speech while simultaneously supporting discussion of LGBT/Minority/Women's issues (but also is against the SJW-ish "white man bad" shit).</p>
<p>The ironic thing about all this is that minority groups are hit the absolute worst by lockdowns and the "New Normal". This is why I don't get why other people on the left are going along with this shit without question and labeling any disagreements "Trump Supporters", etc. Personally I find Trump as complicit as the Dems tbh.</p>

        <p>This is speculation but I saw a huge push in the 2016 elections on the liberal side where the narrative being pushed was a lot like this one.  It seemed like the media was all about getting people angry and pissed at their neighbors, coworkers, even fellow church goers.  I say the last one because people I used to go to a church with in upstate NY were suddenly screaming at each other on FB but the catch was, it was the liberal one yelling and I feel like they were re-posting media articles like left and right that fit their narrative.</p>
<p>It was truly bizarre.  I now think that this was part of the plan.  I've worked in tech so it'd be super easy to track what was shared, by whom, their demographic, marriage, etc stats because well with FB they give it to you.  Same with twitter.  Now you see what they are re-sharing.  Did that article work?  Did they use certain angry keywords or angry emojis or unfriend someone in the process?  Did these people use the dislike button to downvote any opposing comments?  Now gather all that data and have your data algorithms processors mash out data for the faceless people at the top who are seeing if they can manage to get a particular threshold percentage of the population mad enough to cut off their friends or even family off.  Once you get to that threshold keep doing this to keep the education program going.  Now you know your media education is complete and make sure to tweak what doesn't work.  Make sure to test your process on medical diseases as well for every flu season that goes by with hysteria inducing articles on how some kid in their 20's died of the flu or the measles thing or the malaria thing or the ebola thing or the west nile disease.  Also keep thorough statistics on those epidemics and how fast it is shared through the population.  Tweak if things don't work and re-word and re-publish.  Do this through your controlled media outlets.  Rinse Repeat.  Now you are ready for 2020.</p>
<p>Oh I should also include the nonsense science around diet that also gets pushed out.  Track that stuff too.  See if people fall for stuff without questioning it and buy your super food of the week.  Make some money and plan.  Your science PR firm is ready to go.</p>
<p>I feel like there was a push to "educate" the masses to turn on their friends using really sensitive topics like racism, sexism and diseases to make people angry and afraid.  People didn't question it because they didn't question the media.  For me an independent voter I ignored most of it because well I had stopped using cable and watching the mainstream news like over a decade before that.  In fact I was searching for alternate news outlets when I was in college because the Iraq war was once again starting (remember the "weapons of mass destruction"? lmao) and because I knew a few people who were calling out the institution for sending soldiers in to fight what looked like a corrupt war padding particular people's pockets I was really looking for info to back this up and I found well, it was hard to find info.  </p>
<p>Anyhow long story short I feel like boy oh boy someone must've hired some really good psychologists and PR media people and tested this sort of media push on the population.  Even though I called this out back then because well, I didn't like how divisive it made people I had no clue they were working up to something as insidious as this.  But hell just my two cents.</p>

        <p>Ok, but what if I told you that the mask-wearers actually endanger others by empowering dangerous dictators and war-criminals. What if wearing a mask shows obedience and submission to fascism? Would you still do it? </p>
<p>Did you know that Trump recommends mask-wearing? Dick Cheney and Tony Blair are huge mask proponents. Benjamin "baby-killer" Netanyahu is one of the biggest mask-nazis in the world, with harsh punishments for non-compliance. The Republican governor of Ohio calls masks "a symbol of freedom". Alan "I kept on my underwear" Dershowitz is a major mask-nazi. </p>
<p>Maybe mask-wearing isn't as cool as you think, maybe it means that you support a police state and the evil war-machine. Would you wear a KKK hood if they made it a law?</p>

        <p>This. Mask wearing is submission to authority, and it's supported by the most dreadful of authoritarians. The "left vs. right" dichotomy pushed by the media is largely false. Plenty of right-wingers favor normalized use of the cuckmuzzle.</p>

        <p>It's also a false premise:  There is plenty of <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">evidence</a> that masks do not "protect others", and even some showing they make things worse.</p>

        <p>Well, nothing against masks if they make people feel safer (because feeling safe trumps actually being safe right?) I think what I don’t like is that suddenly wearing a mask negates the need to follow social distancing. It’s the case in every single market or crowded place you go to. People feel invincible with a mask on. That shouldn’t be the case...</p>
