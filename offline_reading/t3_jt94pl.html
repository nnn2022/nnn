    <strong>Is COVID 19 deadlier than any other respiratory virus or flu? If so, why?</strong>
    <p><p><em>also posted on r/lockdownskepticism, wanted this subs pov as well</em></p>
<p>I ask this question because people constantly bring up death counts as a reason to extend lockdowns and i'm curious as to what makes this disease deadlier than any other disease.</p>
<p>For example, if i told a pro lockdowner "There are other airborne asymptomatic diseases that kill people" theyd tell me "None that killed 1.3 million worldwide" or something</p>
<p>What is it about the virus that makes it inherently more deadly? And if the virus mainly effects immunocompromised people, is the death count because of the virus or because of Americans generally being unhealthy?</p></p>

        <p>It isn't. These were model calculations that have largely proven to be false but somehow still drive public policy. There are many many many more people infected than the official numbers show which drastically lowers the IFR. It is, as the WHO has since been saying, 0.1 or less. A moderate flu season with a cold virus.</p>

<p>You know with these generalized claims you should always ask them to prove them at a personal level. The exact same way they need to prove someone murdered someone else. Otherwise he is lying and he is accusing everyone around. And that's an offense btw.</p>
<p>It's not the virus that is deadly. It's a lousy lifestyle many follow (thanks to gov guidance) and ruin their health. And then they try to blame somebody else for their own mistakes. That's what's happening and it's worldwide.</p>

        <p>You’re asking a question that no one has an answer to.</p>
<p>What makes it more deadly?  I wouldn’t ask that, what makes it strange?  Attacking ACE2 receptors.  The sheer variety of symptoms.</p>
<p>Is it more deadly?  I have no idea, and I’m a health professional.  But the catch is, that answer is zero sum.  I still wear a mask, not because of death rates, but because of the unknown.  Better to be cautious than not.  Eventually, we will know, and eventually this will go away, like it did in 1918.</p>

<p>As a non mask wearing  lockdown skeptic, I must say that this comment resonated with me. Cheers to a better tomorrow, no matter which opinion you hold.</p>
