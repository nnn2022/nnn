    <strong>Forced lockdowns by controlling the perception of reality for many</strong>
    <p><p>So this from twitter account @ Critica18495985 and wanted to share. Very relevant </p>
<p>“They've always wanted lockdowns &amp; movement licenses but they were never able to create a virus that was both highly transmissable &amp; high mortality, since viruses that kill their hosts tend to stop existing faster.</p>
<p>Now, they realized all they needed was the perception of it.”</p>
<p>This is such a good tweet, because it makes so much sense. </p>
<p>What are your guys thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>Control and power. And keep people working as slaves.</p>
<p>It'll happen again with the "climate crisis". Here's how it'll go down: "climate crisis, no one can travel or buy gas, gotta reduce emissions" "except if its government or super important for business and if that's the case you have to fill out all these papers and get your free travel permit approved". And of course only the rich and powerful will be approved. And just like that, the rich and powerful are free, and everyone else is under constant watch, and only allowed to go to work. All other times they must stay locked down in their houses.</p>

        <p>They already had/have control and power and people already work like slaves.</p>
<p>Back when the baby boomers that most redditers hate so much got back from winning freedom from fascism, for almost the whole world, one person in a family could work a typical job (let's say for example in a factory job making dishwashers), buy a house and furnish it, have pretty good job security, feed and clothe a family with 2.7 children, entertain themselves well enough, save money, and retire with a pension at age 65 (if they wanted to).</p>
<p>By Jan 2020, a typical married couple could each be working maybe even 1.5 to 2 jobs, have little time together, be $10Ks in debt, have zero job security, have little or probably no hope for a pension, perhaps not be eligible for retirement until age 72+, and have troubles making ends meet, much less legitimately be able to afford buying a house (notwithstanding the home loan crisis of c.2008 perpetrated on America by the banking industry that they were handsomely rewarded with hand-outs of $1.3T per year for 10 years).</p>
<p>It's sounds like you're saying they have always wanted lockdowns and movement licenses to achieve something they already had, or to expand something they were already expanding real well.</p>
<p>Those wants, goals, and motivations don't add up.  Hypothesizing and speculating about future events doesn't add any substance at all to the premise.  Yes, IF it were to happen, I invite you to come back and say "I told you so", but currently the evidence that we're headed for climate related lockdowns is not very strong ...</p>
<p>Although, much like the best most sensible way out of the bizarre response from almost all governments around the world to this virus would have been for people to start learning about proper nutrition, and to start making sure that they got good healthy amounts of all the nutrients the immune system needs, yet almost everybody deliberately ignored that, and a lot of people claiming they "believe in science" ridicule and ignore science about these requirements for the body to function properly, so too does actual science show us that the activities that the crazies are claiming to be causing climate change are not true, and the changes they are clamoring for are nonsense, and in fact we need to change our relationship with the soil, plants, and animals in order to have a healthy climate ... Surely so too will practically everybody ignore that just like they have been already, and the crazies will keep saying crazy things.</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware, there little to nothing that individuals can do about grabbing up of power like how a typical person can no longer raise a family with 2.7 children on a typical factory job, but these other powers such as lockdowns due to a virus are something that people CAN  take power and control over.  Apparently people don't do it because that's not what the other lemmings are doing.</p>
<p>As for individuals preventing the crazies from taking crazy actions based on anti-scientific ideas about climate, that might be a little more tricky.  Certainly at least people can start educating themselves about how our mistreatment of soil, plants, and animal husbandry and farming plays the major role in this.</p>
<p>Again; I think your proposition doesn't add up.</p>

        <p>That was extremely well put. What it does not answer is the why. Why the hell are they doing this? That is rhetorical (unless you have an answer). <a href="https://youtu.be/Zd4GFaCXAKc">Why the need to lockdown and vaccinate for this</a> This is a great representation of numbers if you have not as yet seen it. </p>
<p>There is another <em>conspiracy</em> that holds out that there are multiple factions within the elite group, that are at war and their infighting is the reason a lot of this does not make sense to us mere mortals.</p>

        <p>I do have an answer; It's all about protecting and expanding the current and future revenue of the pharmaceutical industry.  This is also in the self-interests of their numerous affiliates, and their stakeholders (which includes some very powerful entities such as State governments).</p>
<p>For this virus, people could just start learning about proper nutrition and begin making sure that they intake good healthy amounts of all the raw materials the immune system requires to function properly, and more specifically avoid becoming dysregulated and therefore causing them serious illness and maybe even death.</p>
<p>That set of about two dozen different nutrients (including the ones that the body needs to properly metabolize the others) ALSO overlaps with the raw materials required by other tissues, organs, and systems to function properly.</p>
<p>If the worst, let's say 20% of people with the poorest relevant nutritional status were to begin getting healthy nutrition, the evidence is that a "case" would be even far less meaningful than it already is.  That alone should almost completely eliminate hospitalizations due to an infection from this virus.</p>
<p>As for people that even that wouldn't quite do it, actual science also knows of a lot of other things that are products of nature that the body can make beneficial use of to avoid the disease processes that go in in a person with COVID.  There is NO scientific evidence that even one person (at least after the first few, when it wasn't even identified yet) needed to die from an infection with this virus.</p>
<p>Not only can the pharmaceutical industry not make any revenue from products of nature (they need synthetic molecules/man-made shit to profiteer), but if people were to start using a variety of sensible and safe amounts of these other various products of nature, that could substantially reduce the reliance of the population on pharmaceutical corporation products for other conditions as well, and the products and services of their affiliates, and thus reduce the ROI for their stakeholders.</p>
<p>In general, people would be healthier, there'd be less illness, therefore less demand for nurses, doctors, their administrative staff, fewer needles, fewer pills of synthetic molecules, less hospitalization demand, less degenerative health conditions, lower demand for medical devices, less worship of pharmacutical corporations and their affiliates, etc.</p>
<p>The "high tide raises all boats" from a generally more healthy population would be spread across all of civilization.  When huge portions of the population are dependant on paying subscription money to a "healthcare sector", then the profit is concentrated, so it can be exploited by relatively few.</p>
<p>As it is, the pharmaceutical industry has invested huge amounts of money and effort to market to everybody that their body is pathetic and incapable of sustaining life unless they subscribe to 5 to 10 of their products every day of the rest of their morbidly obese walkerv/scooter brainwashed life, and relative to9 this virus "everybody must buy a vaccine product".  There's no such thing as free; they're paid for with taxpayer money </p>
<p>And this is just about the nutrients required by the immune system.  Then, there are a whole lot of other nutrients that people might not intake healthy amounts of which can lead to other clinical conditions that there are also pharmaceutical corporation and medical device manufacturer products to "treat" for the rest of their lives too.</p>
<p>If people were to start to wise up to the nutrition they need for the immune system, they could eventually start to wise up to the other nutrients they're lacking causing other clinical conditions as well.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry has FAR too much invested in people being dependant on them to let this happen, and they've been employing the best marketeers that money can buy for many decades to make sure that everybody else really believes in their marketing too, and/or has a vested interest in it too.</p>

        <p>Im not disagreeing with what you are saying, but Id like to paint an even bigger picture.</p>
<p>There is a certain mentality within the powers that be which I guess we can best call "Transhumanism". The roots are very old, but a good starting point is the "Theory of Evolution" by Charles Darwin. Most noteably "Darwins Pitbull" a man named Thomas Henry Huxley. The Huxlex family is an interresting one, as not only they famously promoted the idea that let to the demise of the rulling world-view which was Religion. While Im not a big fan of religion, the new world-view, which still is in place, called "Materialism" has taken a similiar dogmatic stance as the old one.</p>
<p>They Huxleys have risen to a new popularity amids the Corona-Crisis, for Aldous Huxley wrote the very interresting book "A brave new World". In which he shows a world were humans are heavily engineered through chemicals to be "better" humans, effectively erasing emotions from humans.</p>
<p>Now, comes the fun part. Aldous Huxley wasnt taking these things out of thin air. His brother Julian Huxley, was a biologist who was among the first behavioral researchers. He was a promoter of the idea of Eugenics. And one of the founding members of the UNESCO. If you read for example his manifesto: "UNESCO: Its Purpose and Philosophy" it becomes quite apparent that these people have a very distorted view of reality.</p>
<p>Basically what we witness now is the beginning of the Transhumanistic Age, as wished by many of these "Scientists". The idea is, that the human is imperfect and they have the solutions. It goes without saying that their ideas of reality are very narrowed minded and essentially go along the lines of "I know better and therefore you should do as I say". While the experiments they use to determine your likely behaviour are absurd beyond believe. One famous example is the Mouse Utopia research on overpopulation, just imagine for a moment how an Utopia for a mouse would look like, then look at what they build...</p>
<p>Long story short, unfortunately there are people who yield a lot of power who have some very insane worldviews and this is just another step (albeit a major one) towards their "Utopia". Which the non-ruling class will consider Dystopia.</p>
