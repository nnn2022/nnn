        <p>&rt;William's two older brothers and friends, who spent Tuesday night with rescuers looking for him on dirt bikes were stopped from continuing their search the next day.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;'We've been told by all the police, saying we're not allowed to help because we're beyond the five kilometre radius, which is going to put more of a delay in finding him,' his older brother Harrison told Seven News.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The search entered its second day on Wednesday after rescue crews spent overnight searching the area after temperatures plummeted to 7C.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Locals fumed after being advised to keep an eye out for William, but not to breach Melbourne's stage four COVID-19 restrictions by limiting outdoor time to two hours and staying within the five kilometre radius from home.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Locals vented their anger at police during a tense meeting. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;'If that my kid out there, I would want every person on the ground out there, just having a look,' one resident said.</p>
<p>Police stopped volunteers, including his brother, from searching outside because they wanted to enforce the two hour outdoor time limit and the 5km radius from home limit.</p>
<p>This makes me very angry. What the fuck kind of nonsense world are these police living in? Do they have no common sense at all to think that searching for a missing kid should take priority over some arbitrary covid rules? All these idiotic police in Victoria need a kick up the arse. If they want to beat up protestors and stop ordinary human beings from exercising basic human rights - like looking for their missing brother - then they can fuck off to China because that's where their authoritarian ass belongs.</p>
<p>Sick of this wannabe Stalin bullshit where the premier and police are apparently happy to strip people of basic freedoms even when it flies in the face of all common sense.</p>
<p>This is the state that thinks it is okay to arrest people for going out past 9pm just because they want to make police jobs easier. Now I've been over many human rights articles and charters and I haven't seen anything that says government can take away their citizen's right of movement just so police don't have to rush about as much.</p>

        <p>Ummm what the fuck kinds of psychopaths are in your government, Australia?? I had no idea you had such lunatics. I keep encountering news about Victoria, and it’s really hard to let myself absorb that this is a thing happening in objective reality! The knowledge that politicians all over the world appear to copying “Covid policies” off of each other just freaks me right out. 
I literally have no idea how I would react if my kid went missing, and I was told I couldn’t continue SEARCHING FOR MY MISSING CHILD because I simply MUST FOLLOW some transparently insane and wildly intrusive and immoral “rule” at all costs.</p>

        <p>I've been fuming about this all day. And to read morons say "they had 100 people looking, that's enough" just about had me boiling over completely. So send home everyone who wanted to help because of the potential for these people to spread a virus with an extremely low mortality rate, while a missing child who has a much higher current mortality rate can settle for the bare minimum assistance. Gtfo with that attitude, imagine the parent of this boy having to read that. I hope they have a legal avenue to sue, because for all we know it might have been the 101st person who found him alive.</p>
