    <strong>Any mechanics being given the get jabbed or dropped ultimatum at work?</strong>
    <p><p>I have a feeling of premonition my place of work will be mandating vaccines. Any one in my particular industry; automotive, power equipment, heavy equipment mechanics affected by this? I do not believe they will be serious about the mandates just threaten them, as I alone make the company 15-35k a week. I doubt they would risk me and two other guys (50% of the shop) to just leave. Particularly in this labor market. They outsourced me from Maryland and another guy from Louisiana so I know thereâ€™s no one capable around this area.</p></p>

        <p>Lord I hope not. Auto Mechanics are already in short supply around. If you get fired &amp; are an auto mechanic start your own mobile mechanic business.</p>

        <p>I am an automotive technician in Ontario and my specific shop(Chrysler dealer) is not requiring us to get them but offered paid leave to get jabbed. I have refused and gave them my reasons. They all have been indoctrinated into believing it's the fix for Covid. Literally the day after somebody got their second shot at the shop they collapsed and had to get carried out. They also refused to report it as a vaccine-related illness. Both of my parents also have been vaccinated with moderna double dose both exhibited extreme fatigue, body chills, fever. I would move from where I am if they said I need to be vaccinated.</p>
