    <strong>This is something that's been on my mind.....</strong>
    <p><p>Ok so let's say theoretically if that Oxford vaccine comes to the U.S and gets distributed does anyone here think that that could signal the end of the whole mask mandates and social distancing crap? Trust me I'm against injecting a vaccine in me that's rushed but I just don't know at this point what it will take to eradicate this dystopia that we are now living in. Its honestly making me give up on things ever getting to back to how it was.</p></p>

        <p>Yes I think the need for real social interaction is deeply ingrained in our species. After there is a vaccine, the vast vast majority of people will go completely back to normal- I have no doubt. </p>
<p>A few will probably become permanent germaphobes... but that sounds like a personal problem. May require some intense cognitive therapy to correct. </p>
<p>If nothing else the lockdown has shown all of us just how important social interaction really is to overall human wellbeing.</p>

        <p>I really hope your right and that everything flips like a switch back to actual normal. I do have the fear that they won't let this up even with a vaccine that they are so desperately depending on, but at this point I simply don't know what else will break this cycle.</p>

<p>Agreed.  A vaccine shows up, and this bullshit is over.  I don't think that we'll have "permanent" germaphobes, but rather, people who will take longer to normalize than most, but they will eventually normalize.</p>

        <p>This is where I'm at too now. Living like this is not the way to live so if this can make it all abruptly end then I'm more then ok with it. Having a discussion or pointing out the actual facts does absolutely nothing  instead it just ends up doing the opposite (doubling down more and more on the mandates and lockdowns).</p>

I think there is something very wrong with the vaccine scenario, but I don't know what it is.

        <p>There's definitely a big and nefarious agenda out there. Never before has a vaccine been developed at warp speed and all for a virus that is nothing but a new common cold. Plus, they brainwashed the masses into believing a vaccine that over 99% of people don't even need, is going to save them from this "horrible pandemic", and they believe they have to live like this till they get it. Meanwhile, there have been far worse infectious diseases, and no one was in a hurry for vaccines nor did they believe they had to shut down and horrendously alter every facet of life and society waiting for them.  It's mind boggling. Something is rotten here.</p>

        <p>I think so. I have to really try to be optimistic some days, especially ever since Biden came out and said he’d want mandatory masks nationwide, which fueled my anxiety about masks even more. But considering how many crazy governors are keeping restrictions until a vaccine, I think once one comes out they’ll be willing to finally let go. They never said how much of their state has to get it. They just said “until a vaccine.” </p>
<p>Either that, or they give up on November 4, no matter who wins the election.</p>

<p>There are plenty of things I don’t like about Trump but at least he isn’t pushing for mandatory masks, and I don’t think he will. I’m probably voting libertarian this year.</p>

        <p>I’m thinking it could end masks and social distancing but I think the vaccine will be the new virtue signal. There might be some permanent mask wearers, though. I feel uneasy about this vaccine. Another thing people are thinking about is whether or not the vaccine will become mandatory for everyone (except for those who medically can’t). That would lead to another kind of dystopia.</p>
