You got to use Occam's razor dude, nobody elected wants to bring communism to America. Most of them just want to serve the corporations that got them their power.

        <p>I'm genuinely curious, what communist policies have been put in place? And could you tell which elected officials are communist?</p>
<p>The Overton window is shifted so far to the right that people call Joe Biden a commie. The fucker who wrote the crime bill, supported the Iraq war and threatened to cut social security and Medicare. I'm not saying you think Joe's a commie but just using him as an example.</p>

So Fauci's initial advice was true. However, there was no sudden release of evidence in between his statements that proved masks have any efficacy in reducing the spread of COVID, in fact all the evidence since then still points to the fact that <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">they do precisely nothing to limit the spread</a>.</p>
<p>Fauci's email FOI release also shows him confessing that he was recommending them primarily as a visible sign of one's willingness to comply and "do your bit". So, despite what your "fact-check" says, his second recommendation was a complete lie, a fact testified to by his own willingness to drop his mask the moment he thinks the cameras aren't looking.</p>

        <p>That's rather a bullshit "fact-check" you've got there. It basically states the truth - Fauci initially recommended against masks, then changed his tune. But, somehow, it comes to the conclusion that despite saying two polar opposite things, he never lied, because our knowledge of the efficacy of masks changed.</p>
<p>Thing is, we knew before this pandemic that cloth masks, and indeed disposable surgical masks, had never shown any effect in reducing the spread of influenza-like illnesses. So Fauci's initial advice was true. However, there was no sudden release of evidence in between his statements that proved masks have any efficacy in reducing the spread of COVID, in fact all the evidence since then still points to the fact that they do precisely nothing to limit the spread.</p>

        <p>They have spammed that link all throughout this post. They clearly have nothing valid to say and are hiding behind a link that then links to a bunch of so called fact checks that are all asinine, and only approved the MSM narrative by fancy double talk. They remind me of Trelany in RDR2, he can talk for days but never really says anything.</p>

        <p>I know none of us are fans of Fauci but I really feel like he's a scapegoat and puppet more than anything. It's not like he had unilateral power to invoke lockdowns and shutter the economy, he was just the public facing "authority" the media liked to use to explain why the government was doing what it wanted to do.</p>

        <p>The governors are the ones who REALLY deserve it.  Fauci is far from blameless but Pritzker, Whitmer, Newsom, Northam, Cuomo, DeWine, Inslee, Brown, Kelly, Walz and basically everyone but Noem and DeSantis should be thrown into solitary confinement and have their cell doors permanently welded shut.  Let them go mad from the isolation they sought to impose on the People and, when they die, leave the bodies to rot in the cell and cement over the door so they can be forgotten and lost to the inexorable passage of time.</p>

        <p>Last summer was anarcho-tyranny. Destructive criminals were allowed to run wild, while private citizens were prevented by the government from defending themselves and their property. Without the government interfering with private defense of property last summer would have gone much differently.</p>

        <p>I don't know about that. If the government didn't interfere whatsoever, we would've already had widespread conflict. It definitely wouldn't be so clear cut as "exactly the same situation except the good guys with guns stopped the rioters"</p>

        <p>That's rather a bullshit "fact-check" you've got there. It basically states the truth - Fauci initially recommended against masks, then changed his tune. But, somehow, it comes to the conclusion that despite saying two polar opposite things, he never lied, because our knowledge of the efficacy of masks changed.</p>
<p>Thing is, we knew before this pandemic that cloth masks, and indeed disposable surgical masks, had never shown any effect in reducing the spread of influenza-like illnesses. So Fauci's initial advice was true. However, there was no sudden release of evidence in between his statements that proved masks have any efficacy in reducing the spread of COVID, in fact all the evidence since then still points to the fact that they do precisely nothing to limit the spread.</p>
<p>Fauci's email FOI release also shows him confessing that he was recommending them primarily as a visible sign of one's willingness to comply and "do your bit". So, despite what your "fact-check" says, his second recommendation was a complete lie, a fact testified to by his own willingness to drop his mask the moment he thinks the cameras aren't looking.</p>

        <p>In ancient China the ultimate punishment for treason was slow slicing, aka the death by 1000 cuts where they literally cut pieces off the traitor until they died. It was a very slow and agonizing death. I think this sounds better than firing squad</p>

        <p>I agree with you.  I can infer lots of stuff from the emails, but nothing that couldn’t be explained with “well, the science was evolving so rapidly!!!”</p>
<p>For example, the “masks don’t work” email was from when he was publicly saying masks don’t work.  Yes, he later said “Masks always worked!!  I just lied to save masks!”  but that doesn’t mean he want also lying in that email.</p>
<p>Of course, then you have to take a step back and ponder why we need to align his lies with datestamps….</p>

        <p>IMO how you disarm that question, is to ask is what changed about mask technology, especially non-N95 masks (they don't block the aerosolized particles that they say is the driver) and what changed about the particle size of CV-19 since they are smaller the masks are capable of filtering.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but those same questions should be asked even without the email releases.  The emails gave us nothing new.</p>
<p>That said, I think most people have had the truth hidden from them, and the emails are bringing it out.  I bet many people have no idea how many times he gave bad info.</p>

        <p>Fauci is just a face of this. It all goes much deeper. He is one of scapegoats on whom everything will be blamed.<br>
 It's kind of like when you see a bad movie you almost immediatley blame the actors for how bad it is but in truth (in most cases) there are the producers, the script, maybe the sound guys or someone else behind the failure.</p>
<p>Remeber! Fauci is the face of this affair. </p>
<p>There are many many more people working behind the scenes that we don't know the faces of and probaly if saw them in public wouldn't recognize them at all.</p>

        <p>You only betray your supreme bias and ignorance by saying such foolish things. From a perusing of this thread it seems that the average age in here isn’t old enough to see an R rated movie. That’s an upside though, since you guys have time and room to grow out of this crazy mindset.</p>
