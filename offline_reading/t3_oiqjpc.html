        <p>Well, that depends on how you define money.</p>
<p>Your can shift your view of what money is if you consider it as a form of energy. </p>
<p>Firstly, we have to realize that the central banks have ultimate control over <em>their</em> currencies. They steal money from us by inflation as well as orchestrating wars and other crises that people panic over and they make serious profits from. I think we can all agree that the monetary system is fucked. The average American is losing 1-2% of their savings a month and they don't even see it happening.</p>
<p>The problem is that we have never had a currency which allows you to effectively move and store monetary energy.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a way to convert energy into a usable currency that can be sent around the world. An finite amount of an asset that sits on a decentralized network accessible to anyone on the planet but controlled by no one else.</p>
<p>No other asset class can be as safely stored or moved around as Bitcoin.</p>
<p>If you still don't understand it, do yourself a favour and watch this:</p>

<p>I'm not going to spend hours of my time, but just know that you are making a mistake by not learning about this asset class before it explodes in value.</p>
<p>Once you understand what Bitcoin truly is, you will understand why there is so much FUD and propaganda surrounding it. They simply don't want you to own it.</p>
<p>Failing that, there are the bankers coins.</p>
<p>Good luck out there.</p>

        <p>it doesn't matter what you need or what we need . the collapse of the entire economy is going to happen because the banks are literally bankrupt . they going to use digital currency of their own why ? Easy and simple : Digital Dictatorship . if you are using their digital currency you are trace they know how much money you have and how much you waste and how much profits you make they can tax you any amount they want .</p>
<p>why i said go invest in BTC and crypto because they have no control over it . they can't stop it they can't delete it it's on the blockchain . you can not pay taxes and the government life blood is taxes you got the idea ? this entire mess is about going fully digital so we can become China 2.0 if crypto currency your have a literally a bank in you hand . you don't need a bank anymore . crypto &amp; blockchain effective and have the potential to kill the BANKS .</p>
<p>there's already big entities  like blackrock investing on bitcoin and many other tech entities . soros globalist bastard who his sole craft is to di-stablize governments and profit from it is investing in crypto .  if the collapse happen your cash value is 0$$ .</p>
<p>it's not about creating value it's about having control . if you using the bank currency your FUCKED . you become a slave with their new system and they are already experimenting with digital currency .</p>
<p>wars btw government vs people / control vs freedom will be the next phenomena . the age of pirates will come LOL</p>

        <p>That is what I am saying just in so many more words. The fucking globalists will not let us have that freedom. They will cut the internet before they allow their slaves freedom. Digital currency will not be allowed unless implemented by the Central Banks. </p>
<p>War is fucking messy, the people in control of money have shown no regard for human life or poverty. They will not give up their control. There will be a fucking cyber pandemic or some bullshit attack on the internet. They will not give up without a fucking fight.</p>

        <p>The intrinsic value is the network of Bitcoin and any other crypto that people have and use.  It is the ability to send/receive value (and value is just what people accept has value, nothing more or less) without government permission.  US dollars also have no intrinsic value beyond the paper they are printed on.</p>

<p>It doesn't need to be globally shut off, it would fuck me around all the same with my credit card too. </p>
<p>When money is electronic it is a fucking problem. If the power goes out in my city, I will die in a couple days because I'm not a fucking doomsday prepper. </p>
<p>It does not help if I can still use my money in Germany where there is still power and internet. Does not help prevent me from starving to death in canada during a power/internet outage.</p>

        <p>You're disingenuously framing Bitcoin as a failure or non-solution in a doomsday scenario where the internet and electricity are shut off, as if no other assets would be affected.</p>
<p>Physical assets can be confiscated. You can memorize your bitcoin wallet address and no one can take that from you.</p>
<p>It's only a problem if you think they would shut-off internet and electricity globally - in which case you may as well be a doomsday prepper.</p>

        <p>Nope. The process of creating notes involves centralization.</p>
<p>You need to have a shift in your paradigm in order to understand the solution.</p>

<p>Again, the banks are going fully digital. Who would create a decentralized note system, and how? Physical assets can easily be confiscated.</p>
<p>Sorry, I don't believe this is realistic in any shape or form.</p>

        <p>No currency system is realistic, they are all just based on faith. A bitcoin has no value, except the value we assign it. The central bank notes have no value, except the value we assign it. Its an IOU at the end of the day.</p>
<p>The problem is we cannot trust the people who control the money. Bitcoin solves that problem, however, the solution comes at a cost, it is vulnerable to infrastructure attacks.</p>
<p>I don't really have a better solution, I just see Bitcoin has a fucking pretty big flaw.</p>

        <p>Ask the people in El Salvadore (Bitcoin recently made legal tender there) if they're hung up on the flaw, or just damn happy to have a currency to use that isn't deflating their savings away.  That's gonna be us pretty soon I think.</p>
