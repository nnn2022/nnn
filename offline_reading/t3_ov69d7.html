    <strong>My body my choice. No fucking discussion about this. Bye.</strong>
    <p><p>Idiots who don't believe in bodily autonomy can go fuck themselves. I have no respect for them. It makes me angry beyond belief that there are people out there who think like this.</p>
<p>I can already smell the hate comments of triggered doomers from miles away, screeching things like "you're putting me at risk  if you don't get the vaccine!!! Reeeeeee". Well, either the vaccine works or it doesn't. If it works, you won't get The C if you got it, even if you meet people who aren't vaccinated. If it doesn't work, it's pointless either way.</p>
<p>That there is even a discussion about making it mandatory scares me. Like wtf? What happened to "my body my choice"? Nah, a virus with a 99,7% survival rate is apparently more important than basic human rights it seems.</p>
<p>If you don't agree and think this is all about "freedumbs" and unvaccinated people are "selfish" then congratulations, you are no better than the various tyrannical regimes you claim to despise. It is YOU who is trying to make everyone bend to your will so YOU can FEEL safe. YOU are the selfish one, a narcissistic fuck who wants to force everyone to submit to a fucking medical experiment for "the greater good" or some shit. In reality, you just want to feel like a hero, screaming at "Karens" (huge projection, btw) to wear a mask or bullying people into getting vaccinated. You want those juicy orange arrows on Reddit, and the attention your parents never gave you. And then, maybe when you finally reach your 4M likes, you will feel an ounce of happiness, for like three seconds. And then again, you will descend into rage and hatred, because you have nothing meaningful in your life, and this is the only thing that fills the emtpy void that is your free time.Just know, no matter how hard you bully, you will never convince everyone. Your pathetic "fight" is pointless. I hope you'll think about this (I know you won't) and draw your conclusions. The side that advocated for censorship and extreme authority of the state and dehumanized people (eg. "plague rats", btw, being a plague rat is better than being a lab rat ;) ) were never the good guys in history.<br>
Human rights are not debatable. </p>
<p>I've had it. This is my 3rd Reddit account. I kept leaving and coming back, hoping that the toxicity turned down a little. But no, it seems it has gotten worse. I'm leaving for good, I'm throwing the fucking towel.  I'll concentrate on real life and do something that makes me happy.</p>
<p>Also, a big thank you to everybody who had a nice, normal discussion with me, you are what is missing in the world of today. I hope you all have a great day \^.\^.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed. I will not discuss nor debate my medical choices for my body. It's none of anyone else's business, and if the branch covidians don't like that, then tough shit.</p>
<p>They can go and do a tiktok for all I care at this point.</p>

        <p>What bugs me, is that the very same people who harassed me to go to work when sick, and they who attended work with the flu or some other sickness and passed it to the whole office are now the very people who have gotten the Vax and encourage others to get the Vax. Hypocrisy.</p>

        <p>Just curious:  Does “my body my choice” carry over into support for drug legalization, pro choice on the abortion issue, marriage equality for gay couples, and prostitution legalization?  It does for me.  I’m just wondering how philosophically consistent you all are, as I know many on this sub claim to be libertarian.</p>

        <p>While I <em>personally</em> have a negative view of those things, I don't think it should be banned. In the end, it's just my opinion and my opinion isn't universal. People can do whatever they want as long as it doesn't affect my life. I see myself more as a conservative than libertarian tho, so idk</p>

        <p>I agree 100% with what you wrote (except that I don’t have a personal negative view about all those things).  An expression attributed to Oliver Wendell Holmes (though he may not have been the originator) is “My freedom to swing my arm ends where the other fellow's nose begins.”  The problem in the Covid era is that due to asymptomatic transmission, as well as symptomatic transmission by people who still go out in public, is that your nose extends past the tip of your face.  Pressure (but not force) to vaccinate, or requirements in certain spaces to mask and distance, are meant to find that balance between your freedom and the other fellow’s nose.</p>
