    <strong>An argument for or against masks?</strong>
    <p><p>So I have a conundrum.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I get panic attacks wearing masks, buffs, or any type of restrictive covering over my face from traumatic events in my life. So, I avoid or alter the wearing of masks as much as I can</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've already had COVID and recovered a year ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At this point, all studies and tests show both a negligible difference of benefit between wearing or not wearing a mask.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asymptomatic spread is indistinguishable from zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm healthy and pose no risk to others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Friends say I should wear it anyway, if for no other reason than to boost moral of others and community cohesiveness when I'm out. Those supporting this aren't dumb to the statistics, they're some of the best mathematical and analytical minds I have ever seen or known (and I don't say that lightly). There is also the 4-point argument of wearing the mask vs not. And comparing it to cigarette stats way back when, when countless studies were in favor of smoking (later proven false and money propaganda).</p>
<p>What are your arguments for or against this thought from them? I'm looking for serious and thoughtful replies, please. Again, none of the friends are disputing the current studies and tests.</p></p>

        <p>Again as I put in the post, I'm looking for actual arguments and counterarguments for why their reasoning has basis.</p>
<p>One point that lends credence is the difference in symptom tolerance. Not everyone has the same tolerances, so they could be symptomatic and make the decision to join the public without a mask. I believe that's everyone's choice to make but I also see the concern from a safety standpoint and risk mitigation. Especially with our American way of 'fuck you I do what I want,' the argument of personal responsibility often gets bogged down by the aforementioned brutish attitude towards any group safety guidance.</p>

        <p>The argument that people should wear them just to comfort the fearful or to show solidarity are the most dangerous ones.</p>
<p>The people who honestly believe it’s dangerous not to at least have a benevolent intention. The ones who say you should wear them just to go with the mob are cowards and untrustworthy.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. Just to say it's to make others less fearful is bs and shouldn't be tolerated. Using that argument alone, I have told a few to eff off. I don't live my life in fear and I don't make my decisions based on worst case scenarios.</p>
<p>So a counterargument presented is this; I think it's called the 4-Square Argument Chart:</p>
<h2>Data true.               |        Data false.</h2>
<h2>Wear a mask.        |          Don't wear a mask.</h2>
<p>If the data is true and you DO wear a mask, then the correct action is to wear a mask and it saves lives/mitigates risk and exposure for others. If the data is true and you DON'T wear a mask, you've put others and yourself at risk, if not directly harmed others by your actions.</p>
<p>If the data is false and you DO wear a mask, you've at least taken a cautious approach and no harm was done in terms of safety. If the data is false and you DON'T wear a mask, you have to consider whether the data was false (and worse) or false (and better). In which case you're gambling with community safety and possible negative contribution of society.</p>
<p>This argument, in their opinion, supports a logical basis for wearing a mask regardless of the currently known circumstances and facts. What we know now is far different than what we knew about the virus 9 months ago.</p>
<p>So, I see both sides. I understand the logic behind this particular argument. This argument is the basis for their reason for wearing it to support the mental and emotional aspects of the community. Too many variances and the table falls apart and risk can't be mitigated in a meaningful way. I also see why we should also make our own decisions, and that is where I personally lie with my support. But it is difficult for me to blanketly discount their arguments because there is solid grounding for it.</p>

        <p>Masks do a little bit not loads not gonna lie, however if they do genuinely cause you distress then don’t wear them.</p>
<p>I don’t think anyone should be forced to wear them, however I wear mine when I believe it’s necessary to protect the people around me this is a personal choice. </p>

        <p>Thank you for your thoughts. I try not to, or I'll pull it as low as I can get away with it. Places like big box stores are a lot more lenient so I don't wear it and I do see others making the same decision (which helps put me at ease). Even still, it stresses me out that I'm going to get yelled at or cornered and I'm a very non-confrontation person so this isn't fun. I'm so surprised that those who I know that deal so strictly in facts and analysis are advocating for 'feels' based arguments. It's so out of character for them. Even when discussing firearms I've never seen stuff like this happen and these are ppl critical of the government and its involvement in our lives.</p>

        <p>Yeah I would never shout or scream at someone for not wearing a mask myself but it’s a shame there is people that do it. </p>
<p>Honestly the best bet when confronted is to explain yourself even though it’s a shame that your forced to do it.</p>

        <p>So the real answer to your question is that there is no answer.</p>
<p>You cannot reason with ideologues. Social media has widely distributed prepackaged arguments and counter retorts.</p>
<p>There is no evidence suggesting mask mandates are effective. Don’t let them mislead you to laboratory environment tests - they are not the teal world and prove nothing. Look at the real data from states/counties with mandates versus those without. They are indistinguishable.</p>
<p>So since you can’t disprove a negative, you just have to stay strong as a contrarian. I walk into places without one and wait to be asked by staff (if I ever am!). I’m in the south, and people are not asking as much. If they ask, I go through a few things:</p>
<p>I’m healthy, I’ve already had it, what about people with the vaccine?, or the strongest question: “do you follow the state mandate?”. When they answer yes, I remind them there’s a medical exemption.</p>
<p>Only one time did I have an ideologue persist and since I was with my friends I begrudgingly held the mask in front of my nose and mouth (malicious compliance) as we walked to the table. This won’t last much longer.</p>
<p>When people don’t have the media propaganda reinforcing their confidence, they speak up less. Just keep not wearing it and pushing limits gently. People notice. People remember. But always act with decency and kindness - they are simply mislead. Be so good that no one can deny you. Peace always wins.</p>

        <p>You should wear a mask. The virus is real, the propaganda is the anti-mask. Big tech want the virus to take along time to recover because it drives people more online where they can spy on us fair easier, all our financial transactions are traceable, big pharma wants it to get this bad that we need to be vaccinated. We need high mask wearing rates, I understand some experts say 80% coverage of all people need to be masked and since kids can't wear masks effectively we need to before it gets so bad that all brick and mortar independent businesses close. Bill Gates says he wants masks, he's lying, he's always lying, he profits massively from a more to online, he profits massively from vaccines. Don't buy the anti mask rhetoric! I fucking hate wearing one, I tested positive for Covid last April which is more reason to wear one so I can't be a carrier and infect others.</p>

        <p>Whoever is downvoting you is wrong. I didn't come here for group think arguments, I posted this for legitimate debate. I agree with some of your points. Big tech has grown exponentially since we shut down and the only ppl it has benefitted has been the online businesses.</p>
<p>So with that said, are you in support of wearing one to achieve herd immunity or is there another basis for it? We can't wear them forever, and I know in the long run ppl won't stand for that.</p>
<p>I will counteract your last sentence regarding being a carrier and infecting others with this: studies have shown this to be by and large non-existent. There were three or four cases in Japan where this was proported to happen but they also said it wasn't certain if those initial tests were false positive. On a mass scale, the CDC and WHO have both confirmed via multi-nation testing and studies taking data from countless independent centers and hospitals, that ppl who had COVID and recovered from it, were not recurring carriers. If you have it and then recover, you aren't going to be a risk to others. This is, in essence, the safer way to go vs getting the vaccine, if you get right down to it. If you get the vaccine it protects you but it's already been said that you can still pass it on to others. Which, in the end, supports herd immunity through virus infection.</p>
<p>I'm interested in your thoughts.</p>

        <p>He's getting downvoted because his post is full of misinformation. If he really had covid in April, he's no longer a carrier. Wearing a mask in his case only opens him to catch other illnesses from the dirty mask.</p>
