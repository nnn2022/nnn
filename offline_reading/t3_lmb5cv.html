    <strong>How do we make it through this?</strong>
    <p><p>It's been a year now. Some of us have seen through the lies the entire time. Many of us have only begun to question what the truth behind all of this might actually be. And there people here all in between I'm sure, who began questioning weeks or months ago.</p>
<p>There seems to be a relatively general consensus here that the bottom line is, we have to collectively "disobey orders." But what about those who aren't in a position to?</p>
<p>I'm coming to grips with how privileged I've been this last year, while (rightfully, imo) complaining about the situation. I've received monetary help from my sister, who works for Wells Fargo as middle (upper middle? I don't even know how many layers they have I've heard about so many promotions she's gotten in the last decade) management and received a random bonus on top of the stimulus just weeks into the shutdowns (what she recognized as a "weird flex" on Wells Fargo's part), and my mother, who is a 100% disabled Marine Corps veteran receiving full benefits (monthly income, full healthcare, etc.). Even with this help, I've had months when a whole chicken had to last 2 weeks with 1/4 cup of dry rice a day, and nothing else.... Again, I understand (but more than ever realize how I can't <em>fully</em> recognize) that there have always been people around the world in even worse situations than this. But man, it still really REALLY sucks when I'm super fucking hungry and am thinking, "if I just agreed to putting a mask on and not being able to breathe or see (I wear glasses and tried so hard to find a way to wear a mask in my woodworking shop before any of this ever happened but could never find a way to get it to work), I could have a job again probably in a heartbeat in the field I was working in that I loved." But then I think about how much it would honestly suck not being able to breathe most of the day, and how fucking shitty my conscience would feel for <strong>the rest of my life</strong> for just giving in at this point, I think about the suffering others have gone through to keep THEIR conscience clean, and keep going...</p>
<p>But that's all with help.</p>
<p>What measures can people take who don't have ANY safety net whatsoever? Those who are estranged from their families, who live in communities where the population is entirely taken in by this propaganda?</p>
<p>I know there must be a way for every man and woman to fight this beast in their own way. Please share your strategies here. I'm hoping to find more ways I haven't thought of that I can do my part to end this madness as well, besides "being strong" and going out without a mask.</p>
<p>Stay sane and hold fast! <strong>We</strong> are in this together!</p></p>

        <p>The biggest thing is for people to acknowledge the scam for what it is in the first place.</p>
<p>When at least 1/3rd of the population are very unlikely to do this, they will shame and refuse to support businesses or individuals that try civil disobedience.</p>
<p>We are decades too late to helping society as we knew it 2019 and before.</p>
<p>At this point it’s wise to look after yourself and your loved ones. All of this has been in planning for many decades.</p>

        <p>What kinda of tangible ways would you recommend someone who has no income at this point and very little resources left in terms of food stored, etc. to look after their loved ones?</p>
<p>I agree with you wholeheartedly, but I've also heard people who aren't blind as a bat say that same thing all along... at the end of the day, talking about "the lies" on reddit or YouTube or wherever isn't going to get people through this who are already suffering from the physical ramifications of these mandates and lockdowns. Spreading the word is certainly part of it, but that's already clearly being done (as best as it can be).</p>

<p>We're all suffering from the ramifications of this insanity....the only way to get through this is to wake people up. How possible that is I don't know -- I'm personally pessimistic for at least a third of the population. Especially many of the children.</p>
<p>&rt;What kinda of tangible ways would you recommend someone who has no income at this point and very little resources left in terms of food stored, etc. to look after their loved ones?</p>
<p>Sell what you don't need. Move in with parents/family so you can pool resources, lower expenses.</p>
<p>Move away from urban areas.</p>
<p>Invest/save what you can.</p>
<p>Eventually the bond market/debt bubble is going to burst and will collapse the stock market as well....the dollar will be destroyed. It will be useful to hold physical gold/silver and cryptocurrency.</p>

        <p>Sorry but that’s not what I’m seeing at all. I’m seeing people waking up and movements happening and lawsuits in the pipeline. 
I think more people are waking than we think. We are being gaslighted by media who would love us to think we are the minority.</p>

        <p>agree that the key is to support businesses. but many big corps dont need us; we need them. and none of them will risk being branded a trump supporter. i will be thankful if they let us keep electricity. I assume they will let us eat.</p>
