        <p>Because they don't work and are completely worthless. They are there to make you feel good. Have you looked at cases? Everyone is compliant with mask mandates but cases still rise, because they do nothing.</p>
<p>Government mandates are never rescinded, either. These 'states of emergency' et cetera are never meant to be temporary, they are made knowing it is permanent.</p>
<p>If you personally think it works and want to wear one against actual scientific advice and studies done over the years that weren't politicized, go ahead.</p>

        <p>Masks do help prevent the spread of covid.</p>
<p>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-06277-0</p>
<p>&rt; the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks</p>
<p>&rt;This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.</p>
<p>https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352431620301802">Performance of fabrics for home-made masks against the spread of COVID-19 through droplets: A quantitative mechanistic study</a>
&rt;
&rt;&rt;Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.
&rt;

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.
&rt;
&rt;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h694.abstract">Facemasks for the prevention of infection in healthcare and community settings</a>
&rt;
&rt;&rt;Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance.
&rt;
&rt;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4941551/">A review of medical masks and respirators for use during an influenza pandemic</a>
&rt;
&rt;&rt;Adherence to mask use significantly reduced the risk of ILI‐associated infection, with a hazard ratio of 0·26 (95% CI 0·09–0·77; P = 0·015). A recently reported randomized trial showed a significant benefit of both hand hygiene and face masks (worn by the index case and contacts) in preventing influenza transmission in households

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Routine long term implementation of some physical measures to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses might be difficult but many simple and low cost interventions could be useful in reducing the spread.

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19.</p>

<p>&rt;Overall, we rate Swiss Policy Research (SPR) a Moderate Conspiracy website based on the promotion of unproven claims. We also rate them Mixed for factual reporting due to the use of poor sources and complete lack of transparency.</p>
<p>Maybe next time read the peer reviewed sources that show masks are effective and not, conspiracy websites.</p>

<p>Clearly shows mask mandates have no effect of outcome</p>
<p>And regarding your study it has the correlation=causation fallacy </p>
<p>The fulcrum of the whole thing is comparing groups of states according to whether they mandated masks before reopening indoor dining, or after/not at all reopening indoor dining. Call the former group Bucket A and latter group Bucket B.</p>
<p>Relative to when indoor dining was reopening, the virus spread faster in Bucket B states relative to Bucket A states</p>
<p>Except... which states were in Bucket A?</p>
<p>Of 50 states and the District of Columbia, 13 states (CT, DE, DC, IL, ME, MD, MA, MI, NJ, NM, NY, PA, RI), most in the North East Census Region, had implemented a statewide mask mandate before opening indoor dining rooms, referred to as evidence-based opening (Table 1).</p>
<p>Oh, all the ones that already got ravaged by the virus prior to closing indoor dining the first time around. Which means they'd built up more population immunity. Which means, by definition, the Bucket A states have to exhibit slower spread of the virus post-reopening, relative to the states that hadn't been hit much prior to reopening.</p>
<p>Don't even let the debate over HIT confound it. For purposes of this paper's argument, it wouldn't matter whether the Bucket A states reached HIT prior to reopening or not. As long as they got hit heavier than the Bucket B states before everyone hit the pause button, they'll get hit more slowly thereafter, by definition, unless you believe population immunity has zero impact on subsequent spread of the virus.</p>

        <p>I was talking about these studies I originally posted. I was just giving you something easy to read as you obviously don't understand how the study was conducted.</p>
<p>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-06277-0</p>
<p>&rt; the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks</p>
<p>&rt;This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.</p>
<p>https://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf</p>
<p>&rt;The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high</p>

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Overall, our study suggests that cloth face coverings, especially with multiple layers, may help reduce droplet transmission of respiratory infections.

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Mandating face mask use in public is associated with a decline in the daily COVID-19 growth rate by 0.9, 1.1, 1.4, 1.7, and 2.0 percentage points in 1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 21 or more days after state face mask orders were signed, respectively. Estimates suggest that as a result of the implementation of these mandates, more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases were averted by May 22, 2020. The findings suggest that requiring face mask use in public could help in mitigating the spread of COVID-19.
&rt;
&rt;<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h694.abstract">Facemasks for the prevention of infection in healthcare and community settings</a>
&rt;
&rt;&rt;Of the nine trials of facemasks identified in community settings, in all but one, facemasks were used for respiratory protection of well people. They found that facemasks and facemasks plus hand hygiene may prevent infection in community settings, subject to early use and compliance.
&rt;
&rt;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4941551/">A review of medical masks and respirators for use during an influenza pandemic</a>
&rt;
&rt;&rt;Adherence to mask use significantly reduced the risk of ILI‐associated infection, with a hazard ratio of 0·26 (95% CI 0·09–0·77; P = 0·015). A recently reported randomized trial showed a significant benefit of both hand hygiene and face masks (worn by the index case and contacts) in preventing influenza transmission in households

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Routine long term implementation of some physical measures to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses might be difficult but many simple and low cost interventions could be useful in reducing the spread.

&rt;
&rt;&rt;Community-wide mask wearing may contribute to the control of COVID-19 by reducing the amount of emission of infected saliva and respiratory droplets from individuals with subclinical or mild COVID-19.</p>

        <p>I'm not anti-mask (though, I don't like wearing one because it makes my face hot and I'd rather breathe oxygen, rather than my own CO2) but I am anti-mask mandate. It should be your own decision, not the government's!</p>
