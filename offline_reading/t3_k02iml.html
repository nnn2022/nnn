    <strong>What is the deal with Australia?</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously, their lockdowns and restrictions are Soviet Union style. I think I can speak for all of us when I say the rest of the world is absolutely disturbed. This is supposed to be a country in the free western world, not North Korea.</p>
<p>I’ve read comments here and there saying that Australia had actually been pretty authoritarian even before this nonsense even started. Can anyone in Australia elaborate? What the hell is going on down there?</p></p>

        <p>Their politicians are all bought by the Chinese. When China finally snaps, Australia is the first to go. There’s too much to get into, but long story short China has been screwing over Australia for a long time. My theory is that the Chinese are having them lockdown as the “example” for what the rest of the world should do.</p>

        <p>I remember that I watched a documentary about the New World Order a few years ago. The documentary was already old, from the late 80s or the early 90s.</p>
<p>It was said that Australia is a test country for the NWO.</p>

        <p>To add to that comment also, this year with our restrictions and lockdowns, police kicking in doors over Facebook posts etc. made me realise just how bad it is. Here in Melbourne our state premier has much more power than I ever realised and effectively had last say even over our prime minister. This year I lost my career, had to move back in with my parents AND depleted all of my savings since I lost my job, it will take YEARS to recover. Not sure what to do in the future but moving overseas to pursue a job in my field is something I’m seriously thinking about. It also doesn’t help that so many aussies are brainwashed by the media, which is all owned by the same person, Murdoch.</p>

        <p>so so many things here are illegal or banned, I never realised just how strict and how many freedoms we don’t have until I went to Europe, go 2mph over the speed limit= fined do it a few times loss of license, ride a bike with no helmet = illegal , jaywalking = fine , airsoft guns illegal, getting caught with a toy gun, it’s an immatation firearm now, alcohol in public or a passenger in your car has an open drink, illegal. Vaping nicotine illegal, modifying your car is also frowned upon and can get taken off the road, highest cigarette prices in the world at around $50 a pack, they banned tanning beds a few years ago, and there is many more little things that are banned or illegal, these are just a few things I can think of off the top of my head and I know some people will say ‘oh who cares about this or that thing’ but there is just so many little personal freedoms that we can’t do or even make the decision to do even though it should be your own choice. I LOVE my country and fellow Australians, but our government are a complete bunch of muppets. Anything remotely risky they take away from us ‘for our safety’. People should have the right to choose (to a certain extent as long as it doesn’t affect others)</p>

        <p>Australians are extremely servile and functionally brain dead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svogj_qPL_I&amp;feature=youtu.be">Here we have a woman being choked by a police officer for the "crime" of not wearing a mask (she had a medical exemption, not that it matters).</a></p>
<p>I can't believe this worthless policewoman really has the audacity to tell this girl to take her hands off the policeman's vest while he's choking her. Maybe if he was actually arresting her, you know by restraining her hands, instead of placing both his hands on his throat to choke her as a means of venting his spiteful rage and asserting his tyrannical desires, then maybe she wouldn't be able to push or pull on his vest in an understandable attempt to get him to stop choking her.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41QfI-3l3gQ">A second balcony recording shows she did not start the physical altercation.</a></p>
<p>This barely made it onto the news. Police hit her with "resisting arrest" because if a policeman chokes you then you better just let him do it according to our culture. The media, of course, carried that exact narrative (when they bothered to report on it at all).</p>
<p>We have many similar cases ranging from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0XQewPwaEs">police stomping on the head of a mentally disabled man</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvTyMSF2Wc0">arresting a pregnant woman in her home in front of her family because she posted her anti-lockdown beliefs on facebook</a>.</p>
<p>Victoria Police are absolute scum. And most Australians lick these jackboots even as they stomp on our necks, all the while more concerned about what pronouns should be used and whether or not we offend the Communist Chinese.</p>
<p>Australia is a lost cause. The CCP doesn't need to destroy Australia because Australia is destroying itself.</p>
<p>Edit: it's 3am so I forgot a couple of important points. Might add more links later, but just look up that they used this "pandemic" to introduce police powers to enter homes without warrants and to SEIZE YOUR CHILDREN if they think it is "reasonable".</p>

        <p>Its been a long time coming, I was living in Victoria before the lockdowns were introduced but prior to this for years there has been social engineering under the guise of being progressive to empower the government to become more involved in making more laws and solving the problems that they have been gaslighting. It starts with the people, the majority of Australian people cannot think for themselves and regurgitate anything that comes from the TV. </p>
<p>It started in Victoria when the first lockdown was due to the premier stating that 1 in 4 people was not following the restrictions and that there was a massive amount of fines issued to people so they had to take harsher measures to flatten the curve. Not long after it was found that there was no evidence for the premier to make these claims, he literally made them up. And the Chief Health Officer and Head of Police both deny that they supported this action even though they did little to stop it. </p>
<p>They then enacted a state of emergency which temporarily stopped the democratic process and allowed the Chief Health Officer to be able to make rules up as needed, legally this was originally supposed to be for a 6 month period as it was recognized that it can be manipulated and taken advantage of by tyrannical governments. Surprise surprise after the 6 months it was extended for the following 6 months. </p>
<p>The latest croc of shit that just happened was another state South Australia just lockdown for 6 days because of a 'new strain' of covid that you can have without symptoms and is supposed to be more deadly than the original. It seems that every state will go through new 'waves' and lockdowns to test people and see how many people will comply. </p>
<p>As a country Australia being so young has been indoctrinated for a long time, our politicians have been selling the country off mainly to China and our Media is very good at keeping the people dumb. A few decades ago, gun rights have been taken away from people, since the covid panic began those with legal firearms have been warned that if they breach these covid policies they can lose their licenses. </p>
<p>People here seem to be comfortable, there is this idea that since it isn't all that bad that it will just go away. Sad to say it but we are the ground zero for this agenda and the majority of people here will willingly sign up to have their land, money and rights taken away to be safe from a disease that right now the majority of people have died from it have been linked to botched quarantine scandals from the Government. </p>
<p>People here dont fight back, they havent had to deal with anything serious before and have a blind faith in big brother to make everything better. Everyone else is a conspiracy nut that deserves to be locked up because they are dangerous to my health</p>

        <p>💯 it is showing here. As you say, people from communist countries have experienced the problems that will come from these exaggerated socialist ideals. It seems that any one that has graduated from a school in the past 5 years has been brainwashed with them. </p>
<p>Australia has had it good for a long time and has been the playing ground for alot of the elites. This country will be ground zero for alot of the agendas that will be played out around the world and will be one of the new meccas if this new normal comes to fruition.</p>

        <p>The thing is there is no excuse for that ignorance, it's willful ignorance. Honestly after what's happened this year I'm a little peeved at my father, for years I've been trying to get him to understand that things are a lot worse than he thinks. I realize now he is super ignorant and has been too busy living the good life to pay attention to the world. He acts like he's always been this super conservative guy, but I've seen pictures of him when he was young and you can tell he just was a total hippie long hair and everything. When I realized I knew 10x as much about what was going on than my father, I was livid. Anyone paying attention could see the direction the english speaking world was headed over the last 4 decades.</p>
<p>He's a bit of a narcissist, the kind of person who wants to be liked by everyone and that biased him toward only accepting information that supported populist politics.</p>

        <p>It’s interesting you mention the media and regurgitating what comes from TV because something lacking in Australia is a presence of Alternative media that we see in other countries, sure there’s Sky news but that’s nothing more than Tucker Carlson style, controlled opposition. Besides that there’s only Avi Yemini who’s basically the GG. Allin of journalism.</p>

        <p>People here are big on obedience and look to the government to take care of them or others. Even where we do have legal protections police overstep them without pushback or question. As an old example to show this isn't new or restricted to Melbourne, when the Olympics were hosted in Sydney police would board buses to check everyone's text message history. No powers to do that but they just get compliance. </p>
<p>I didn't really realise how bad it was until this year though, how many people actively support this hyper controlling nanny state.</p>

        <p>They claimed there was an imminent terrorist threat and had some very aggressive security for very large sections of Sydney. This was coordinated by our internal intelligence agency (ASIO), who described it as both the largest security undertaking in AU history to that point and the safest Olympic games in history. Whether such a threat was real, I cannot say, but I did not become skeptical of government motives in 2020. I can say no threat eventuated and I have never seen security like what we had for an Olympics in any other country.</p>
<p>As to what they hoped to get out of checking texts specifically, your guess is as good as mine.</p>

        <p>same is happening in Curaçao now.. they are stripping people of basic human rights.. I read the law paper signed by officials and it litterly says that govnerment officials can enter your home, search yuour mobile phone or put you in quarantine camps without a judge. Spread, sharing or thinking about anti corona/lockdown stuff is also jailable and can be fined.. people in Curaçao and some people in The Netherlands are already protesting against this, but this is just a taste of what is to come...</p>
<p>AND I STILL HAVE PEOPLE IN MY FRIEND GROUP THAT CALL ME CRAZY.. this island is is a constituent country owned by the Kingdom of the Netherlands.. this is insane</p>

        <p>I am not in Australia. But I spent time there in 2019. </p>
<p>Australia has different cultures. 1st gen Immigrants, aboriginal Au and the majority Au citizens.   </p>
<p>The majority can also be broken down as east/west.   </p>
<p>The ones in the news are eastern majority. </p>
<p>Australians are tough, brave people. Even in the face of overwhelming force (Here a police force) some, will not back down. </p>
<p>So this this can lead to violent clashes. I blame the leadership for not reconciling this and looking for better solutions. </p>
<p>Many leaders in countries are afraid and do not know how to handle this disaster.  </p>
<p>Not many are handling it well in my opinion. </p>
<p>Fear in the south eastern part of the country has caused this panic. </p>
<p>Additionally some government people are being advised by Covid SJW's .</p>
<p>Asia is also suffering great loss of freedoms.</p>

        <p>Your totally right but everything opposing lockdowns, or following the rules get labelled with risks to other people's health. Which allows these things to happen. </p>
<p>It's crazy how with enough indoctrination we have some of our own friends that will support a BLM protest but condemn anti lockdown protests and agree that they deserve to be published. </p>
