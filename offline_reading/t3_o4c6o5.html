    <strong>Decided to come back: more people I know took the vaxx.</strong>
    <p><p>There's no one to talk to in real life anyway. All the Christians I know have taken it too. There was one I thought may be on the same page, but she ignored the subject.</p>
<p>I figured it out with two I talked to today. Oh, the woman who was being refused medical care over not taking the vaxx, I think she has taken it. I sent her a whole email sharing that Revelations of Jesus Christ video and she ignored the subject entirely and talked about some furniture she was buying instead. Even the ones who I thought would never fold are folding.</p></p>

        <p>I am at the point where I may stop talking to people. It's breaking my heart. I don't make the vaxx the first object of conversation either. I deal okay with people on a surface level, and am polite and having to hide all my feelings and opinions and that's getting tiring. People seem different from this too. I understand the depression and more. I am too depressed to try with them anymore, and my disappointment is more then I can deal with. Husband is only one, but I fear his sold out best friend influencing him. My social life is destroyed, what there was of one, and I already had lost so many people.</p>

        <p>Luckily I'm an introvert so I don't really have any social friends to lose. My wife has realised that I won't get the Covid mRna shot and that I won't wear masks at all. </p>
<p>We go out to restaurants with the kids, go shopping, etc and I feel the longer we do that with me clearly not getting sick, the more she's less fearful of it. I don't talk about it anymore with her or anyone anyone because I'm over it and I honestly don't give a fuck. People can sense that off of me just by my demeanour. </p>
<p>If anyone has an issue with how I behave or conduct myself, that's their issue, not mine.</p>

        <p>I'm giving up socially and plan to never broach the topic except with online people or others in the know online. I am too tired to deal with the few people I did talk to. I may still talk to some and a few zoom groups but I know I have to adjust my expectations about people now and ease up on myself. If my life is meant to be a hermit and 90 percent of people have turned into deluded followers or what some call here NPCs, there's nothing I can to do to change this and I am wasting my time.  I am glad your wife is seeing your example and living life too with your kids. IRL, I have been surface with most people and am not talking about it, but have lost motivation. I am just going to live life with husband, and I did start shopping and going places, I figure I had to live whatever life I had left, though I am realizing it's going to be devoid of people I can actually talk to outside of the internet. I've been disappointed too much too often. I have nothing in common with the people who have lined up. Yeah be an introvert, it's better now.</p>

        <p>Yes I have to stop the worrying, and remind myself I have no control over this stuff, there is nothing I can do. I can't tell people what to think believe or do. I am going to try and enjoy what I can. I am planning some things for I and husband to do.</p>

        <p>I convinced husband but get worried with all the pressure around him. That best friend who lined right up may be a problem. I even said to him why do it for a job and destroy your health? He's gotten a lot sicker since then with heart problems. The job laid him off just a couple months after he took the would be prion shot. I saw us as friends too but when I tried to warn him he didn't listen. I was very very very new to my research on the vaxx and failed on my end, I even gave him one provacc website trying to be "fair" though I said that guy's excuses didn't add up but was sending him links to Covid Vaccinated, those websites that had all the people who died, moderna article. I don't even think he looked at anything and felt he had no respect for me, written me off as "crazy"/</p>
<p>My husband thinks his heart went bad before the shot but I remember he got it before the worse problems appeared. I have felt shut down a few times. I told one group, "I don't trust the new mRNA technology" twice and was ignored. I even took the risk of posting Robert F. Kennedy posts on Facebook and one good Winter Oak one but was ignored. I have been frozen out and shut down. I went kind of quiet now, it's hard, IRL there's no free thinkers outside of two long distant friends. I hope husband never takes it, I know I would be screaming and crying. He is all I have. Yes I know he is at risk of Covid, whatever real virus beyond cooked up PCR tests. Just what they have done to our lives is unconscionable. What scares me about the brainwashed sheep is they find this all "acceptable". My emotions, the little bit I show, seems to upset them. There's something wrong with people. I think about selling everything and moving all the time because the people here find this all acceptable.</p>

        <p>Just know you are far from alone, I had to leave my job not because of a mandate but because I was sick of watching the sheeple head to slaughter all around me. Not to mention my fear of them transmitting something to me. They all think I'm crazy not to get it but THEY ARE THE CRAZY ONES just remember that. Yea its sad to part ways with friends but  it's better to back away now before their brutal side effects kick in. I've discovered new real friends in the people who see through all the B.S. anyway so my old sheeple friends and fam can shove it</p>

        <p>Maybe one day I can meet some new real friends locally, I know people who think the way I do are online even if there seems to be none in this town. That's too bad you had to leave your job but better to protect your health and wellbeing and I think the dangers of them transmitting something to you are there too. I was treated like I was crazy by the very few I told. I think that "fading out" for a time from very pro-vaxx groups may be in my betterment. I could do some minimal activity and keep things casual but we all have to protect ourselves. I have had thoughts too with the people I care about, knowing what their possible fate may be, being more distant may protect us from future heartache. I am glad you have new real friends who see through the crap.</p>

        <p>One of the best ways to filter through your local sheep without having to speak is to go out in public in an anti vax shirt. I have a shirt with a syringe crossed out on it, and each time I go out I'm always pleasantly surprised at how many compliments I get. I know instantly who is on my side and who's against me just by being present its great you should try it!</p>

        <p>You need to do what‚Äôs best for you. You can always change your mind in the future when more research comes out BUT you can never undo it once that shot is injected into your arm. You have every right to decline it based on it being experimental. Honestly I would never get it either way because the government and lawmakers have proved to be completely untrustworthy. I guess I‚Äôm lucky in the fact that my family is all on the same page along with other members of my community who are not buying into the fear mongering and Media BS. They are basically fed up with all the government corruption.</p>

        <p>Guess it doesn't surprise me. Probably even Seventh Day Adventists are lining up too, they don't eat meat etc. Still can't figure out why the vegan and holistic crowd didn't ask more questions, there has to be few among their numbers refusing.</p>

I hope I am wrong and 5 years passes and everyone's alive. But that said some are dying and getting sick now and it's being kept out of the news.</p>
