    <strong>Went to the beach today</strong>
    <p><p>I live in SoCal, it’s been pretty rough here in regards to the hysteria, but today I finally got my girlfriend to go out somewhere with me, we went to Seal Beach in Orange County, CA because she really wanted to swim. It was the first time during all of this that I’ve seen her take off her mask in public while remotely near anyone else. It was Labor Day and there were many people enjoying the beach, young and old, people swimming, boogie boarding, people chilling in groups on the sand and god damn it was a much needed experience. It was priceless to just sit on the sand and watch my girlfriend enjoying the waves and smiling, and to hear all the children laughing and having a good time. There were old folks out and about on the beach and on the main street adjacent to it, just living and going about their merry way. Some people were wearing masks, a lot weren’t. That’s fine either way, I think it should be a personal decision anyway and not to be compelled by the government. White people, black people, Latino people, Asian people not wearing masks and not being stopped by the cops over it. It was truly beautiful. It’s moments like that that give me hope. Not everybody is a doomer. I sincerely hope that people can see past the purposeful instillation of fear more and more. Damn just looking back on today it truly brings me joy. Never in my life have I ever considered excitement to see strangers faces. I was super happy for the children. I wonder how many of them were getting to see their friends. All around it was just a huge relief as a Californian to have something pretty much normal. I don’t wanna put bad energy out there, but now that I’ve had this nice, healing experience I’m just waiting for some bullshit to blind side me. Anyway I just wanted to share this glimmer of hope for you guys. I truly hope everyone can pull our heads out of the gutter and collectively learn from this experience and realize why it’s important to keep our representatives on a leash, and keep ourselves armed. I really hope once this all unfolds it will create a couple generations worth of people that will be very mindful of the next craze to come about. It’s gonna be real awkward when all the doomers have to face the music. I’ve kept mostly silent about my true feelings with everyone but my girlfriend and some trusted family members. Gonna be real awkward when my so called friends have to cop to the fact that they’ve been played and accept the consequences of all this bullshit.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, as a side note, just thought I’d point out the big banner that flew by on a plane while I was there that read “Orange County votes for Biden and Harris 2020” or something close to that effect. I don’t like either party personally or the choices that we have for the election, but I just wanted to testify here that I saw that today and found it hugely ironic seeing as the largely Democrat narrative is to stay inside and fear for your life. To be fair I really don’t know exactly who paid to run that banner, but it’s nonetheless ironic since Democrats tout the stay at home fear monger narrative. Seems quite opportunistic and borderline predatory to run an ad like that when you expect beach goers to not be at the beach but they are so might as well taint nature’s horizons with your political bullshit. That being said, fuck the Democrat AND Republican parties in their current state, America deserves better.</p></p>

        <p>We went to the beach on Friday and it was beautiful. My kids have been begging to go back. Planning on going as many times as we can in the next few weeks!</p>
<p>I hope you get more moments like these!</p>

        <p>Isn't it refreshing?  The sun and sand and water and fresh breezes help people  realize that there is real life, real health going on outside the doomer narrative.</p>
<p>I posted about going to a beach in NJ over a month ago.  Few masks anywhere except at stores and waiting for outdoor dining. Hundreds and hundreds of people on the beaches with only two families wearing masks. I'll bet they felt very odd.</p>

        <p>It's funny, I was solidly left-liberal when I was young, but after I realized that the US center-left party warmongered and passed controlling laws as much as the US center-right party, I realized that I had no political 'home', and that my personality actually leans libertarian.</p>
<p>And yet, having dealt for decades with the clusterfuck we in the US like to call "our healthcare system", I can't see any better option than going fully single-payer.  Not ACA, which is the disaster I predicted it would be, and not "Medicare for all", which would just entrench the existing mess, but true single-payer.</p>

        <p>I said I <em>lean</em> libertarian.</p>
<p>Single-payer would be, IMO, the <strong>least-bad</strong> system.  It's centrally-paid but not centrally-planned.  </p>
<p>I'd be all for a fully free market health care system if such a thing could be phoenix'd from the ashes of the cartelized, government-mangled system we have now, the one the mindless conservatives laughingly call "free market".  Get rid of the AMA cartel, and remove all government protections of the pharma cartel.  I'd even say go back to an all-cash payment system, but the poor would be entirely fucked in that case.</p>
<p>What we have in most countries, but especially the US, is a "sickcare" system which treats all ailments as "drug deficiencies" which prefers life-long maintenance on expensive patent drugs over actually treating it once and done. And, somewhat on topic - insist on endless vaccine jabs instead of ensuring that people have healthy immune systems.</p>
