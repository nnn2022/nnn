    <strong>I honestly don't care if some elderly people died indirectly because of me.</strong>
    <p><p>I've been told I should care, I cared for a while, I considered continuing to care, but I just cannot care anymore.</p>
<p>Even if I had undeniable proof that I was a link in a virus-spreading chain that transmitted coronavirus to a few elderly people and contributed to their deaths, I would feel very little guilt.</p>
<p>Why should I feel guilt? These people have lived a lifetime and reached their full potential while I still have a life to live. I need to fight my way into an insanely competitive and rigged world. I have to fight for my own survival and those that I care about.</p>
<p>Why should I sacrifice my life for people who I don't know, who don't care for me, in a world that's so uncaring? We can pretend we're democratic, and that we care about other people, and that we're equal. The reality is that our world is still immensely unequal and unfair.</p>
<p>Since the lockdowns started I have self-harmed and almost attempted suicide, I have cried for hours, have gotten an unjust fine for wearing a mask 'improperly' and have had back, wrist and shoulder pain from spending too much time inside. No one ever gave me sympathy. Instead they mocked me for my inability to adapt to the 'new normal' and obviously for 'choosing' to feel depressed. Once I went against people's advice and took every chance to socialise, my depression went away.</p>
<p>And this is only my suffering. For every covid death there are thousands suffering from the lockdown's consequences and hundreds who are at risk of dying from the lockdown.</p>
<p>Asking me to sacrifice my mental health, my physical health, my educational and financial future, for elderly people who have already lived their lives is just irrational and selfish.</p></p>

        <p>I'm a mask and lockdown skeptics. Why? Because of I do care. It's not contradictory to care about other people and be lockdown skeptical. People claims they cares about others, don't want others to die of the virus and therefor support the lockdown. Many haven't get to know lockdown skeptics' stance better. Not all of us are selfish, not caring about other's health and seeing health as only your own responsibility. Here's why I'm a lockdown skeptic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lockdown delays medical treatments. E.g. cancer treatment and dental work.</li>
<li>Lockdown affects mental health negatively, increase depression, suicidal people, cause social isolation and anxiety. Masks affects people with PTSD, anxiety, claustrophobia and other mental health conditions.</li>
<li>Lockdown affects businesses and the economics negatively. Many people lose their jobs, businesses lose customers etc. because of fewer are able to buy when they stays at home. It makes poor people poorer.</li>
<li>Lockdown affects victims of abusive family, relationships etc. negatively and they can't escape as easily.</li>
<li>Lockdown and social distancing affects linguistical minorities and people with disabilities negatively. Deaf people relying on facial expressions and lip reading won't have access to it because of masks. People with autism, mobility issues, auditory processing disorder etc. may find communication harder, schools are less willingly to accommodate and special services either gets closed or bankrupt.</li>
<li>Restrictions kills elderly too, not only the virus itself. Elderly in nursery homes aren't allowed to meet friends and family, go outside as much and participate in recreational activities. Some elderly commits suicide because of that.</li>
<li>Old people won't live much longer anyway, so the choice is often between them living a year or two shorter - but they're enjoyable or two years longer - but with awful restrictions.</li>
<li>Lockdown makes life harder for homeless people and charities.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't think it's that you don't care. I think you just have a different perspective and that's fine. We can both be lockdown skeptics, care about others and live normally without letting pro-lockdown people label us as "selfish". Most elderly are fine with young people living their lives. It's mostly the younger generation that fears death so much they fears COVID19 which is just another flu with a different name.</p>

        <p>&rt;Restrictions kills elderly too</p>
<p>Don't forget about the cases where senior homes were abandoned by staff who were afraid of the virus. Many many elders died soaking in their own feces, starving, not receiving their medication etc... Truly sick stuff these people went through because of the media fearmongering.</p>

        <p>That makes sense because in normal times, recruitment for quality help in these places was already difficult, so it would be exponentially worse in these times and leave the poor residents in dire straits.</p>

        <p>Woah! I didn't even think about half of these. These are valuable thoughts. I always think about how more people are dying from missed treatments, but I didn't even think about the disabled. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yeah I have see old people out at restaurants, walking without mask, because there is a difference between being alive and living. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I always say if the rates were 100 times worse (so like 0.05 instead of 0.0005 lol) I would still stand with the underprivileged. AND we stand with lonely people, abuse victims, and people losing their careers. It's NOT selfish. Humans deserve dignity.</p>

        <p>Agree. It's also important to remember that the COVID19 isn't as deadly as Ebola, but media still choose using scary images of people wearing hazmat suit in the newspaper. Media hasn't done a good job when choosing pictures.</p>

        <p>I agree. I’m probably a lot older than you but I think it’s insane and evil to ask the young to sacrifice themselves for the old. This already happens in wars. No reason to add epidemics to the burdens of youth.</p>

        <p>I can relate to your story. There is a huge difference if you attend a wake of a 8yr old compared to an 80yr old. Suicides and drug overdoses are skyrocketing and no one seems to care. I think it's finally time for "grandma" to suck it up and stay home. I think more people think the same way as you but are just afraid to admit it. I know it's harsh to some people but it's the truth.</p>

        <p>Even grandma has been largely overlooked in this epically misguided quest to “protect grandma!”</p>
<p>Here in Colorado, we had a nursing home literally stage a protest where the residents made signs that said “we’d rather die of Covid than of loneliness,” and came out on the lawn to be interviewed and show people this <em>isn’t</em> actually at all about what they want.  Nobody asked them.</p>

        <p>Good for them. I think some were even being confined to their rooms in nursing homes. So no visitors, no bingo or community room.That's horrible for them.  I think the psychological effects of Covid are being greatly under estimated.</p>

        <p>So.  Here's the thing.  It's been proven that Humans have a limited amount of GAF for other people.  Do any of us really, really reallllllyyy care about someone starving in a third world country?  On the surface, we say yes, we care.... but it's very superficial.  We DO care in that we know it's horrible.... but the emotion, the empathy, only goes so deep.  Our ability to care deeply is actually limited.   We are limited to how many social relationships we can handle (150), and I think 5 is the number of absolute best friends.... because of how our brains are developed.</p>
<p>Our capacity to GAF about others has evolved with us.  My ability to GAF about someone in a NY nursing home is very limited to a superficial level. Do I care? Yes.  Am I heartless, no.  But I am not able to feel DEEPLY because I don't know them, they're thousands of miles away and... well.  I'm doing to keep my own head above water these days.</p>

        <p>Ah, but big cities don't - because within the boundaries of a city, people have their own 'tribe'.  We're evolved to look after those closest to us and have a certain sense of detachment when strangers are hurt or affected by disaster and calamity.  This isn't saying we're all psychopaths though.  It's just that we are limited by how our brains developed to an approximate number of social interactions and 'feels'.  And I don't mean just Thoughts and Prayers feels or BestWishes, or here's a 10.00 a month subscription to save a starving child feels.</p>
<p>We care... just not that deeply, and when confronted with the choice of caring about ourselves and those closest to us, vs. The World Population, we'll choose ourselves and our tribe first.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I cannot recommend studying evolutionary psychology/biology enough. A lot of things one might wonder about, explanations can be found there.</p>
<p>We are apes running on 10,000+ year old hardware. We're meant to live in groups of 100-150 people, who we have known and will know for our whole lives. Most of our ancestors had deeper relationships with their most distant tribesmembers than we have even with our significant others. I also believe that is the source of most if not all of our mental health issues, especially depression and anxiety. We're not living in a human-friendly environment, just barely enough so that most people don't choose the noose.</p>

        <p>Exactly.  We are socially conditioned to say we care and pretend we care, deeper than we actually care.  To do anything else is to be accused of being selfish or a psychopath.  I actually have had times in my life when I seriously wondered if I was a narcissist or a psychopath, and then I read about the inability of Humans to 'feel' very deeply for more than X amount of people.</p>
<p>It's not mental illness to admit it and embrace.  And it's social conditioning to do otherwise.</p>

<p>She was very old, and ready to go. It is just a tragedy the isolation is what killed her, when she had hell of a lot of family who would want to be with her and hold her hand as she passed. To spend time with her, the last few months she had, but instead she was isolated and went downhill quickly.</p>

<p>I oppose lockdowns in large part <em>because</em> I actually do care about these people. Say you care all you want, but when you’re literally torturing them to death (yes, isolation is recognized as torture) it doesn’t really matter what you say.</p>

        <p>Don’t beat yourself up; the whole world doesn’t actually give a shit about the elderly, and they never have.  They’re providing a convenient scapegoat for other peoples’ fear right now (“I’m not afraid for myself, I’m afraid for old people!”  Bullshit.  You’re scared for yourself).</p>
<p>I’m a nurse, and both prior to and throughout nursing school, I worked in nursing homes.  They have ALWAYS been a clusterfuck, and demonstrate how warped our society’s view of quality is—that being, that if you still have a pulse, it was worth doing all the things we did to you that made you this way.</p>
<p>That occurred to me a while ago—nature is merciful—it doesn’t allow us to “naturally” exist for long in a miserable, chronically sick state where everything that we valued and everything that made us US is gone.  Most people in nursing homes are there because of Alzheimer’s (which in my opinion is the single cruelest way to die, and which if I ever get diagnosed with, I am ABSOLUTELY NOT living like that), and/or from being dragged back from what used to be a life-ending sentinel medical event (stroke, heart attack, multiple bouts of cancer, etc).  Basically, the only reason Covid killed so many of these people is that medical technology had—quite often—already “dragged them beyond” what their natural lifespan would have been.  So they exist in a permanent state of “one foot and three toes in the grave,” and are basically taking ten years to die instead of two weeks.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I am NOT advocating a “Midsommer approach” where we forcibly execute people once they reach a certain age...but as a nurse, it does trouble me a LOT how much medical intervention we throw at old people just to keep them here longer than their body “wants” to sustain their life.  There are whole ethics panels in hospitals and longterm care who are paid to argue about these things, so do NOT feel bad that you notice the unfairness and seeming lack of logic to it.  You’re just more observant than most.</p>

        <p>I actually had to volunteer for a few days in an elderly home. It was absolutely awful. For the residents I mean. The vast majority of them where in wheelchairs, and so drugged up or deteriorated with dementia that they could barely string two sentences together.</p>
<p>You know what would actually be useful for the elderly? More funding for equipment and care workers so they can continue to live within their community.</p>

<p>PS: just in case you think I'm being sarcastic, I'm not. I don't give a shit either. Before the pandemic, any number of our actions could have caused someone harm or even death, but no one ever cared (how many times did you go out with a cold, or what you thought was jUsT a CoLd).

        <p>This has nothing to do with the elderly - they are being tortured to death through isolation, and most of them hate it and oppose it just as much as we do. Protecting the elderly is just a media-friendly justification for lockdowns, but it is not the true objective OR outcome.</p>

        <p>The irony is, suddenly everyone cares about the lives of those they didn't care about before.  How many doomers are regularly visiting nursing homes to brighten the last days of their elders?  They're in aged care because their family won't or can't look after them.  Knowing that in a few short years, their parent(s) will die.</p>
<p>2020: it wasn't age, neglect or pre-existing conditions that killed them it was COVID-19</p>

        <p>Do you know what they used to call pneumonia back in the day? "The old man's friend.'' Because it offered an easy exit out of an otherwise difficult passing. So maybe the rona will be looked at the same? This may sound cruel, but for many frail elderly, dying is an arduous, prolonged process, anything that speeds it along is a kindness.</p>

        <p>I really agree. I mean I’m staying home if I’m sick and probably contagious (regardless of what I have), I’m not going to go into a nursing home or someplace like that if I may have been exposed. But other than that I’m living my life. I don’t associate or live with immune compromised individuals right now and I’m younger and healthy....if I want to go to a gym, party, restaurant, nightclub, casino, or whatever that’s my choice. </p>
<p>This effort to make people feel guilty because they theoretically could give an elderly person (who still have a 94% survival rate over age 70) the virus through six degrees of separation is quite insane. There have always been people who are high risk for complications for other pathogens including the common flu but we never applied this same moral logic.</p>
<p>On the flip side this fear is driving economic, cultural, social, and psychological destruction in our society.</p>

        <p>“We’re all in this together” paints the picture that we are all living in some world of fear and despair and can only hide in our homes hoping for a magical vaccine. Going against the narrative and just being happy, living life without endless fear gets you ostracized. I think those that are most afraid have also made themselves miserable and the thing about misery is that it likes company.</p>

        <p>I don't think they have any real friends or family. They might say they go out to the pub with their friends, or they're worried about their elderly/infirm family members, but you don't feel "compassion" for millions of total strangers without it wearing thin. You can't be a "citizen of the world" in a "global village" while genuinely caring deeply for those closest to you.</p>

        <p>&rt;Why should I feel guilt? These people have lived a lifetime and reached their full potential while I still have a life to live. I need to fight my way into an insanely competitive and rigged world. I have to fight for my own survival and those that I care about.</p>
<p>Agree. They had their family, their easily affordable home ownership, their new cars every few years, their bountiful and stable careers. I'm in my 30s and I haven't even had a taste of those things. Boomer mismanagement and corruption and bullshit has been holding me back my entire life.

        <p>Agree with this. Whilst I think the world is less cruel than you state, existing is not easy especially for those without privilege. Of course you don't want to go out of your way to 'kill' someone, but it's not like we've always (as a species) spread diseases. Flu can also kill elderly people.</p>
<p>The point is that many of the people who make out they are 'caring' are looking out for their own interests. Why are most of the media pro-lockdown? In the UK at least I'm sure it's because most of the leader writers are in the vulnerable category (men, often overweight and over 50).</p>

        <p>I feel for you -- you have every right to feel this way and it breaks my heart the pain you are going through and others.

        <p>Ummm you should definitely care, the problem is just that the immense harms of lockdowns do not justify the very low likelihood that any one of us was involved in some otherwise avoidable chain of transmission that lead to someone’s untimely demise.</p>

        <p>I disagree with the things you are saying, but I was not trying to guilt trip you. You said you are experiencing depression and other mental-health related issues. That’s why I suggested you seek help; there’s nothing wrong with seeking the help of mental-health experts in times of distress. I hope you feel better.</p>

        <p>The cause of my depression for my whole life was a combination of having abusive parents and not being able to make friends because I lacked guidance and persistence. Three years of therapy and medication trials never put a dent in that. Once lockdowns came I sank to rock bottom and realised how many chances I actually had and flunked them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I went a little off the rails and did the exact opposite of what my therapist and people around me told me: "Everyone's going through this. This isn't a good year for socialising. It's actually dangerous to socialise so please don't. Here are some mindfulness techniques." And so I got involved in a lot of stuff and became more active than I'd ever been.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So socialising, not therapy, not pills, is finally making me happy and helping me reach my potential.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I absolutely cannot support lockdowns knowing that they push me and many others to the point of suicide. And this is just the tip of the iceberg of the lockdown's negative effects that prove that this cure is worse than the disease itself, such as being trapped with abusive people.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You can read more about my mental health related to corona in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j7vshz/society_has_entirely_abandoned_mental_health_and/">this</a> post. And I encourage you to read about the disastrous effects of the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I never told anyone to let their grandparents die. I have grandparents too. Elderly and other vulnerable people can take as many precautions as they want, and their care takers should also take precautions. But they have no right to force people who are not their friends or family to sacrifice themselves.</p>
<p>Your rights are your rights as long as they don't infringe on other people's rights.</p>
<p>And I think you're nuts for thinking everyone should make these huge sacrifices just because coronavirus came around. </p>
<p>Tell me, did you even give a crap about the elderly before coronavirus came around? Because the elderly have been dealing with abuse, medical problems, understaffed and underfunded systems for decades. And those things are more likely to kill them than coronavirus but people still don't care. Why are people suddenly pretending to care about the elderly just because coronavirus came around?</p>

        <p>No it is not dangerous to everyone. That's where you're wrong. Since you voluntarily found this sub, do everyone a favour and read the sources for our arguments. There are many studies from WHO themselves indicating that for healthy people under 65, the virus has less than a 1% chance of killing them.</p>
<p>A doctor in my country came out and said that all our coronavirus deaths (all elderly over 60), were also caused by 1 or MORE chronic condition. The notion going around that it's killing young healthy people is a mix of propaganda and number play. You know what did kill young and healthy people? Mad Cow Disease. It killed teenagers too. And they still didn't ban beef.</p>
<p>On the other hand, heart disease and diabetes is killing a lot of people, and will be the killer of some half of those over 50, but apparently only coronavirus justifies stopping the entire world.</p>

        <p>Because it’s a new illness that took the world by storm (and even if you get it and recover quickly it can still take a tole on you’re immune system). And a less then 1% chance is still a chance, because that’s just death, and doesn’t account for the people who survived but still had to be hospitalized.</p>

<p>For one thing, even the flu can do this, and studies aren't conclusive because they only followed people for a few weeks after they recovered. That is not enough time to determine 'permanent' damage.</p>
<p>And a less then 1% chance is still a chance, </p>
<p>WTF. Yes 1% chance is still a chance. You have a 1% chance of getting hit by a car, you have a 1% chance of getting struck by lightning. You might as well not go out then. I think you're the crazy one here. You can stay in your house afraid to go out if you want, but don't force it on others.</p>

        <p>Yes, you should let your grandparents die. Not necessarily now, not if they're lucid and able, but they deserve a dignified death when the time comes. Don't be cruel. Don't milk every last second from them by way of aggressive medical treatment because you're too scared and selfish to let them leave their old broken body behind. And no, we're NOT in this together. Not because of people like OP, not because of people like me, not even because of people like you, but because we're animals who evolved to live in packs of a certain size. Packs, not hives. We're physically incapable of genuinely caring about millions of total strangers. Anyone who says otherwise is dishonest or delusional, maybe both.</p>

        <p>It's the 3rd leading cause of death in the US for everyone, not only old people. Also, your statistic is a blatant lie, it's more of an 8% chance.

        <p>Are you that deeply out of touch with reality? There is a chance of death in <em>everything</em>. Every single thing you do or do not do in life, there is a chance that you die.</p>
<p>Death is a natural part of life. It's coming to us all, sooner of later. You can hunker down and weep in a fetal position, realizing that everything carries a risk of death, or you can face life with courage, knowing that every moment is so precious because life is fleeting.</p>

        <p>Have you worn a mask for your whole life whenever you're around other people?</p>
<p>If not, you have most certainly caused the death of someone else by passing on any of the several infectious respiratory illnessess that have circulated among the human population since... well, the dawn of time.</p>
<p>Oopsie woopsie. How could you have been so careless? Is it maybe because suddenly the media has told you to care about all of this?</p>

        <p>1: There is always a chance of death. Death is a normal, necessary, inevitable natural process. Death is a part of life. The opposite of death is not life, but birth. The opposite of birth is death. Everyone dies someday. The elderly, on average, are closer to death. Most people who die from COVID would've died within a few years from the flu, pneumococcal pneumonia, a heart attack, or chronic/terminal illness. COVID just got to them first. Risk is unavoidable, death is unavoidable. Most elderly/infirm individuals know this. They know their own risk tolerance, have come to terms with their own mortality, and act accordingly. That's on them, not you or me.</p>
<p>2: Wearing a mask makes it difficult to read facial expression, impeding healthy socialization. Young children, the hearing impaired, and autistic individuals are particularly affected by this. Staying 6 feet apart likewise impedes healthy socialization. While we didn't evolve to care particularly deeply for million of total strangers, we did evolve to care quite deeply for up to perhaps a few hundred social contacts, more than just our immediate househould. We evolved to touch each other, see each others faces. Particular cultural traditions regarding socialization may vary, but these traditions developed over decades or even millennia, not a few months of government/corporate mandates. Such rapid sociocultural change - especially with no genuine threat to be avoided or benefit to be gained - are damaging to the bodies and minds of even the otherwise healthy.</p>
<p>3: Old man's family should've come to terms with his mortality long ago. They had plenty of time. Those who from COVID are usually quite old, obese, or chronically/terminally ill. They should've known grandpa only had a few years left, something would take him soon enough. Yes, mourn and grieve. Yes, miss him, miss his dirty grandpa jokes and the stories of his youth. But accept the cycle of birth and death, because no one makes it out alive. The death of an elder does indeed affect mental health, but so does being a young person told to mask up and stay 6 feet apart when they should be working and playing unfettered. The difference? The elders have already lived their lives, while the youth have their whole future ahead of them. Or at least they should.</p>
<p>Having to even explain this is infuriating.</p>

        <p>Masks aren’t a major issue for me, as long as they don’t become permanent, but “social distancing” is cruel and inhumane IMO. What are people looking for new friends or relationships supposed to do? (Doesn’t apply to me personally.) How are people supposed to celebrate and mourn important events? What about live music, choral singing, festivals, worship, and the hundreds of other activities that give life its texture and meaning?</p>
<p>The virus isn’t going anywhere and the “rules” just kick the can down the road. We should be dealing with this virus the same way we deal with other threats: protect the vulnerable and let life go on.</p>

        <p>I understand where you’re coming from but it’s hard to “protect the vulnerable” when the people who are vulnerable are people with common health conditions. Those people need to work too so it’s hard to just put them in a bubble. 6 ft social distancing isn’t really that big of a deal and when you’re in a situation where that isn’t possible, a mask is the smartest thing to do. As long as the gatherings aren’t inside you should be ok</p>

<p>It is though. Are you ok with never touching any other people again? Infectious respiratory diseases are never going away, so you'd be putting other people at risk. If we apply the same logic as these covid guidelines have, there's no reason to ever stop wearing masks and social distancing.</p>

        <p>I disagree completely. If you turned off the news, would you know that there's a "pandemic" going on? <em>Most</em> people who die or get severely ill are above the average life expectancy or already in bad shape.</p>
<p>Why would the government ever give back any freedom that's taken away? What would they gain from doing so? They want more limitations, rules and regulations, not less. The only time we're given any freedom, is when they think there's enough pushback from the majority of people and they think it's insignificant enough to "allow" us to get that freedom. There's no true freedom but the freedom you create yourself. Unjust laws are meant to be broken.</p>
<p>When you've been conditioned that masks and social distancing are called "the new normal", it means they're <em>not</em> planned to go away. Ever. The only way they're going away if people resist it. </p>
<p>Again, there are and will be other infectious respiratory diseases always out there, some more viral and some even more deadly to certain groups than covid. According to what we do now, what reason would there be to <em>not</em> wear a mask forever?</p>
<p>&rt; Plus the only people I need to touch are my immediate family. </p>
<p>Good for you, that's not certainly the case for everyone. Do they not matter, as long as you're comfortable?</p>

        <p>That logic is so bullshit. Why should I care about that hypothetical? I have the news so I might as well take advantage of it. I’d find out the second one of my family members got diagnosed with it.  You guys here are trying to justify the deaths of hundreds of thousands. HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS. That’s not justifiable by any means. If that’s not enough, think about the loved ones of the people that die. How do you think they feel? You guys talk about the mental health problems caused from the lockdowns, yeah well how about the mental health problems of losing any loved one? And yes, I guarantee you the second we have an accessible vaccine we will drop the masks and social distancing. This should not be politicized, it’s public health. Wearing a mask doesn’t make you a sheep. What would the government gain from keeping us in isolation? They want society to go back to normal just as much as you and I</p>

        <p>According  to the WHO, seasonal influenza, commonly called the flu, causes 3-5  million severe cases every year and 290 000 to 650 000 deaths.</p>

<p>Both are respiratory illnessess that spread the same way as covid-19.</p>
<p>What about people who die from those? Did you think about any of that before 2020?</p>
<p>People die. That's life. All of us will die. All of our loved ones will die. Better accept it and make peace with it, rather than fight it.</p>
<p>Nothing in life is safe. Everything carries a risk of death or suffering. We have a difference in <em>opinion</em> about what level of authoritarian government overreach is acceptable in order to try to prevent deaths from this <em>one particular cause of death</em>. My opinion, based on my studies of the subject, and my personal ethics I have built along the several decades I have spent on this planet, is that the current covid prevention measures are massively disproportionate to the threat at hand. There are other more important causes of death that are not dealt with with nearly as much intensity. I also have very low faith in any kind of authority. Everyone is out for themselves and everyone has an agenda. Every man seeks power for themselves first and foremost. That's why I choose my own way.</p>

        <p>We have a vaccine for the flu for gods sake. And those statistics are worldwide correct? Covid had similar stats in the USA alone. We don’t have a vaccine, so don’t act like we do. But whatever let’s ignore that we can prevent deaths from covid cause everyone dies eventually, right? I don’t understand why you try to justify death at all. People die from those a lot of the time because they don’t have access to the treatment they need to survive. That’s called poverty, and it’s trying to be fixed. Clearly not successfully, but my point stands. I can’t get over how bullshit that “everyone dies” statement is. Based on what you’re saying, that logic can justify any death. Holocaust? Everyone dies it doesn’t matter. Genocides? Doesn’t matter, everyone dies eventually. A lot of covid deaths are preventable. Stop acting like they’re not.</p>

        <p>The flu vaccine is hardly effective enough to tout as the medical marvel you seem to think it is. And you're comparing a pandemic - a natural disaster akin to a wildfire - to intentional systematic execution? Yeah, you should probably come to term with mortality.
