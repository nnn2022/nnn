    <strong>Any runners in this sub? Has your performance decreased from daily mask-wearing?</strong>
    <p><p>When the pandemic was in its earliest phase and I went back home from college, I would run several laps to my stop sign and back which is about .8 mile. I’ve been a cross country runner and tennis player all through high school. 
I’ve worked 3 different jobs the past 7 months, wearing masks all day long. I’ve been running every day for over three months. I can only one MF lap and I’m so out of breath and worn out.. it feels like I became a smoker or something.. it sounds weird I know, maybe I’m paranoid or something but I am ridiculously fit and normal health and my lungs just feel shot these days. It makes me kind of depressed.</p></p>

        <p>At the beginning it has decreased a lot, but actually increased my performance when running without masks</p>
