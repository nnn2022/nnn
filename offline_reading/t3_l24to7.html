    <strong>I cannot relate to other people anymore</strong>
    <p><p>I was never a pretty socially active person, apart from a few social contacts here and there, but after 2020 I'm finding it pretty much impossible to relate to other people.</p>
<p>The constant fearmongering, the virtue signalling, the need to conform and to demean any wrong-thinkers...</p>
<p>I've tried to build new social contacts, but everything is now dictated by corona and politics. Just keep your distance when meeting up, let's cancel our meetings because the government said so, let's all cheer for Merkel and Biden and let's laugh and complain about those stupid Trumpists and Corona critics and Right-Wingers...</p>
<p>I can't have an honest conversation with the people around me. Every one of them (with the exception of one single person who at least tries to see my point) would rather listen to their own fear and the media, instead of having any debate or consider different viewpoints.</p>
<p>I had people around me praise the censorship on Twitter, dismiss my concerns about BLM and Antifa and the way the government handles the pandemic as straight up conspiracy theory bullshit and call any person who leans the least bit right or doesn't see Trump as Hitler incarnate as a literal Nazi.</p>
<p>Obviously because of that, I don't feel comfortable talking with any of them about my viewpoints or the newest stuff going on in the world. I also don't feel comfortable talking about my depressions and frustrations in regards to the lockdown, since the general sentiment coming from them always seems to be something along the line of: "Yeah, that sucks, but oh well, nothing to be done about it. You'll just have to live with it. We all do."
And I can forget casual social gatherings as well, since they refuse to even do that, what with the newest lockdown restrictions...</p>
<p>This might sound harsh, but I can't see the people in my social circle as free-thinking autonomous people anymore, when they all spout the same stuff the media feeds them daily, when they freely allow themselves to be controlled by their fear and praise the lockdowns (while at the same time admitting that they heavily suffer under it and that some of them aren't even afraid of the virus themselves), when they dismiss people like me as conspiracy nuts just on the basis that we criticise the lockdown.</p>
<p>Everytime I go outside and see everyone in their masks and keeping their distance, I feel like a loner among a herd of robots. The same way those people would see me as a Nazi conspiracy theorist. It eats me up inside. Just what the fuck happened in society that we ended up at this point?</p></p>

        <p>I’ve lost a lot of friends too. I can count the real ones left on one hand. A few others I can have superficial convos with and only hang out if we don’t bring anything up. It’s honestly depressing and I can’t share any views on social media anymore bc I get personally attacked. If I do have a fuck it moment and share my views, I get unfriended, no discussion. Sad times we live in.  :(</p>

        <p>You’re not the only one. I definitely find that this group has been helpful in changing my mind a bit as there are clearly many people who still haven’t been brainwashed</p>

        <p>We were all sold down the river years ago.</p>
<p>It’s just not apparent until this past year.</p>
<p>None of this would have been possible without the very intentional engineering of the minds of the younger generation through social media and millineals and even genx through decades of “progressive” teachings in universities.</p>
<p>Make no mistake. This was intentional and in the works for decades.</p>
<p>The morons you and I see all around us on a daily basis genuinely think the government and media cares about them.</p>

        <p>Your story sound just like mine. Even just a simple walk in the park is depressing. I work as an in home cna caregiver and the clients I care for watch cnn, abc and the like for a majority of my shift. Its infuriating to listen to all of the lies and fear mongering for hours and hours every day. I just have to bite my tongue, much of the time literally. Sometimes I even taste blood by the end of my shift.</p>

        <p>Omg you just described my life. I am just an HHA but I am thinking about quitting, I can't deal with the 24 cnn that elderly people seem to watch. My clients are really pushing me to get the vaccine, have any of yours brought it up?</p>

        <p>Every single day. I just lie and tell them that they had limited quantities last time. But I dont know how long that lie will last. Their is absolutely no way I can tell them I chose not to take it. I've heard them talk to family members about how stupid people must be to not want this vaccine. It's just sickening how they cant even consider any point of view other than their own as anything but crazy or stupid. Than my boss always sends out group texts telling us to talk to the clients more. But what am I supposed to talk to them about when they are obsessed with politics and they are extreme leftists?</p>

        <p>I too have been disappointed by the reactions of many of the people I know over the past year. Some seem to have no capacity for critical thought (e.g. they laud the ramp of censorship as a defense of civil rights), others pay lip service to the narrative and even deride those who question it, seemingly to get in good with the thought police. And maybe the most common reaction is none at all. People who suspect and perhaps understand the nature of everything afoot but are too cautious to speak up. And that cocktail combined means that soon no one will have a platform left to speak freely at all.</p>

        <p>you've just got to be open about what you think in a light hearted and polite way. keeping it inside will destroy you, you've got to just share your opinion when appropriate and accept that most people will disagree. most people still believe that we should be free but just think these are temporary measures so if you put your thoughts in a way which doesn't paint them as the enemy then they will listen. if they don't listen then you don't have to speak to them.</p>
<p>if a shopkeeper asks me to wear a mask I just say politely, "i dont agree with the compulsory measures" and I leave if they ask me to. If someone wants to have a conversation about it then i have a conversation about it but I dont force it on them if they dont want to listen.</p>
<p>Its not always easy but seriously if you dont say what you really think it will give you chronic depression.</p>
