    <strong>What parameters would have changed your mind?</strong>
    <p><p>So, despite my disagreement and disappointment with almost every sentiment expressed here, I'm still curious as to what type of virus would make y'all feel differently?  A 3% death rate? A 30% death rate? A virus that killed younger people as opposed to older?  No scenario at all?  I have no intention to argue or even discuss any responses, just doing a general survey of sorts.  If you respond, thank you very much.</p></p>

        <p>A virus that the media didn't manipulate statistics and try to force the public to be afraid of and act irrationally. You know, a REAL EMERGENCY where the media's goal is to keep everyone calm because everyone is panicking from real things happening around them that they literally witness with their own eyes. So basically the opposite of all the theater, lies, and fear mongering being pushed for over a year now.</p>

        <p>One that's not created with media campaigns.  In a true emergency the first priority is to keep everyone calm. That should have been everyone's first clue. The censoring should have been the second. None of this is about a virus.</p>

        <p>None.  I don't understand why we gave up the Constitution in the face of an illness.  If you're talking 30% death rate you won't have to beg people to stay home.</p>
<p>I am certainly am tired of the way officials move the goal posts, two weeks to flatten the curve has become forever until zero positive test results.  Horse</p>

        <p>Ah, I see what you're saying.  You don't think that any measures have any effect on the spread of a virus of any kind.  Ok, yeah the premise we'd have to agree on is that the spread of a virus can be changed by human behavior and societal restrictions.  If we aren't there, then the question is indeed absurd to you.</p>

        <p>man, just be reasonable, if the virus was real you wouldn't even be on that sub, because it just weren't there. people here are not morons with aluminum hats, if there was a deadly pandemic, we would be the first to fight it, and with all the means, and we would even wear 10 masks if we had to. but the truth is, what we don't like is being deprived of our lives and our freedoms, under the guise of an imaginary disease.<em>📷</em></p>

        <p>Lockdowns were used during the black death. Quarantines in Venice were in place for 30, later increased to 40 days, until sailors could prove they weren't sick. The city of Ragusa (now Dubrovnik) implemented a 30 day lockdown. Other measures such as health passports were used to monitor people's travels. </p>

        <p>Yes but the difference is what like 40 percent of the population died to black death while less then 0.01 percent of people have died to covid. Also quarantining non sick happened in only 2 cities? Its crazy how disproportionate our response is now in comparison</p>

        <p>I don't believe it was limited to just two cities. I can't find a comprehensive list, probably due to the fact this happened nearly 700 years ago, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559034/">this</a> mentions that, "After notification of a fresh outbreak of plague along the eastern Mediterranean Sea, port cities to the west were closed to ships arriving from plague-infected areas", so we can imply that many cities had similar precautions in place. </p>
<p>And yeah, 40% of the population is a massive death toll, but luckily today we have much better medical technology and medicines, so it's really great that the death toll now is much lower, but also terrible that 2.84 million have died. </p>
<p>However I live in a country where we are pretty much done with Covid, to the point we just had a small outbreak, which lead to a 3 day lockdown, but now we are back to pretty much no restrictions, except for masks, which will be ending in the next couple of weeks, but a necessary precaution. So from my point of view lockdowns have been successful and don't feel like it was an overreaction.</p>

        <p>Yep, Australia. Tourism is important but only makes up 3.1% of our total GDP (which is actually a lot less than I thought) but still a vital industry and obviously that suffered a lot, as did every country I assume. But since we have it pretty much under control here our <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-03/australian-economy-s-recovery-intensifies-on-household-spending#:~:text=Australia's%20economy%20powered%20into%202021,established%20for%20the%20period%20ahead.&amp;text=The%20RBA%20is%20forecasting%20the,be%20led%20by%20household%20spending.">economy has actually bounced back this year</a>, which is very promising, but I assume will take a while to fully recover (I'm not an economist, so I can't be confident in how that will go). </p>
<p>As for international travel, we can't do it just, there are exceptions of course, but we can't for tourism. However, we can now travel to New Zealand without the 2 week hotel quarantine, and there is talk of that bubble growing over the year to include other countries. </p>
<p>No covid would be lovely, but I agree, not realistic at this time. But with the covid vaccine rolling out right now hopefully we will be able to travel more towards the end of this year.</p>

        <p>In the face of a pandemic (the real definition, not the CDC/WHO version of it) why would we keep open Supermarkets, warehouses, large offices and other such places where footfall is huge, yet close down local businesses that can provide the very same products and resources with significantly lower footfall and less people crowded together?</p>
<p>Even though it says the contrary right on the side of the box they came in, government, medical health “experts” and Doomers all insist on wearing masks and that everyone else should while using this inflated sense of self importance, yet the orally expelled waste that is caught by your mask significantly increases your chances of contracting Bacterial Pneumonia and trust me if you get Covid while having pneumonia that really is a cocktail of death... so why would governments and medical “experts” advise you to perform an action that is counterproductive to actual actions you could be taking to keep you and everyone else safe?</p>
<p>The Great Barrington Declaration... read it! This is an infinitely more preferable solution to a pandemic outbreak authored and signed by 3 actual experts in their respective fields (one of whom was representing the WHO in this study... shock horror!) and co-signed by over 20 other professionals who are highly respected in their fields... how can all these top of their field experts be wrong but that talking head on the tele is right? Every single time those talking heads made a statement, it ended up being false, a lie or both... why are people still listening and believing them? They’re scared, they’ve literally been devolved into a child like state and are afraid of a boogeyman virus.</p>
<p>The constant flip flopping by the government on decisions made in the “interest” of public health.</p>
<p>“Masks don’t help prevent spread of virus”</p>
<p>Next minute</p>
<p>“No wait they do”</p>
<p>“We’re not going to mandate masks”</p>
<p>A few moments later</p>
<p>“Everyone wear a mask”</p>
<p>“We’re not going to mandate vaccines”</p>
<p>Does a pirouette </p>
<p>“No one left behind, vaccines for all”</p>
<p>If you would please answer a question of mine?</p>
<p>Having laid out verifiable facts and an alternative solution to the “pandemic” problem which is clearly a better solution with a focused protection on those most vulnerable, why do you still insist on believing the government? Knowing how badly they have fudged the last year and flip flopped worse than a magikarp in the desert how can you still have faith in them? If any person in your life was this wishy washy and changed their mind on the flip of a coin, you would cut them out of your life like the tumour they are... why don’t you hold the government (who should be held to the highest standards of law) to the same or higher standards?</p>

        <p>As long as the disease affects almost solely elderly and already compromised individuals, and with such a low death rate even among them, I can’t see the cost being worth the restrictions. If the death rate were as high as even 5% despite medical care in relatively young and healthy people, I could see sense in a short lockdown like was initially instated, and I would go out less without state enforced restrictions. I agreement with others here, I would maintain that everyone can assess their own risk tolerance and will react how they feel is necessary to a given virus, and that hard restrictions should not be within the power of the government to enact.</p>

        <p>Personally, I think that if it was dangerous the government wouldn't have to be manipulative in order to convince people. If it was really serious, we'd be able to see it in our lives rather than just on the news, and we'd react to that danger. I wouldn't mind taking serious precautions if there was a 10% death rate or something serious like that. However, that is quite unrealistic given that a virus that deadly would not be very contagious since it'd kill all of its hosts and therefore die out easily.</p>
<p>Basically, if we were in real, serious danger I would make sacrafices without a complaint. But what I see is an extremely low death rate across most of the population, a government who don't care about our health putting in place unnecessary, and often tyrannical measures, manipulative behaviours and propaganda, people supporting this in the interests of shaming others on social media for likes, the huge harm of the restrictions ignored while we focus on a few covid related statistics without putting them into perspective, a campaign based on fear, and too much trust in governments instead of assessing risk accurately.</p>

        <p>If I'd seen a pile of bodies outside every house, that would make me think twice about going shopping. But I've yet to see any evidence whatsoever of a pandemic, so I've been shopping pretty much every day for a year, even when I don't need anything. I just enjoy browsing non essential items, while I breathe freely and touch as many things as possible with my non-sanitised hands.</p>

        <p>Ebola. It has a death rate of around 90%. I vividly remember in 2014 when it was rampant in West Africa. There were doctors actively helping Ebola victims over there and then coming to the States. There were positive cases in Boston! A 90% mortality rate of a highly highly infectious virus. These doctors that were told to quarantine so as not to infect others, openly defied those orders under the assertion that “I am not sick.” There are photos of them, riding bicycles through their neighborhoods with CDC officials in full hazmat suits following them. 90% mortality rate. There was no travel ban. The economy didn’t shut down. Billions of dollars weren’t dumped into vaccine development. 90%. If you don’t know that what we are going through now is purely a political power grab than there is no hope for you. If we didn’t destroy the worlds economy for a virus that literally melts you from the inside out, but we did for one that pretty much only kills grandma and grandpa, what other conclusion could there be? So I guess the difference is that, if people are literally dying in the streets and nurses/doctors are actually dying too instead of making tiktok videos, that is when I will take a sickness seriously.</p>

        <p>If we assume the deaths attributed to Covid are accurate (arguable).
The worst hit places like NYC lost about 1 in 500. Globally it's about 1 in 3000.</p>
<p>It affects the unhealthiest in the population, so not random at all. </p>
<p>To impact all of society the way lockdowns have, I might be more accepting and patient if it was 10X worse AND had a more Ransome victim profile, affecting the  younger and healthier population. </p>
<p>As it stands, government is swatting mosquitos with hammers, after they land on us. Because when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. </p>
<p>Long term damage from overreaction will be many times the consequences of the virus.</p>

        <p>Nothing would change my mind to make me support the lockdowns, capacity limits, mask mandates, spending packages, etc </p>
<p>Everyone is responsible for their own health and we should all be free to choose individually whether it's too dangerous to go out or not. That's all.</p>

        <p>Pure and simple: if the virus has occurred at a different time, with more popular elected officials, it would not have garnered as much attention, and led to the draconian measures that were instituted. That’s it.  We have had severe rounds of illness, namely the flu, that has come and gone through society over the brief history of America.  This time, it was about wrecking the economy, and winning an election.</p>
