<title>Question for all of the “science-based” pro-vaxxers: Why aren’t they testing everyone for antibodies before injecting people? Doesn’t that make sense, considering the vax is experimental with no long-term effects known, when science has proven natural immunity is much more powerful than a vaccine?</title>

        <p>So they were OK testing potentially every perfectly healthy human being on the planet for a "asymptomatic" disease every other week with the PCR test but testing for natural immunity for a vaccine rollout that will take 2 years is too much?</p>
<p>Nope, doesn't fly for me. </p>
<p>They're doing it on purpose, for their apartheid control state to force this population control jab. Natural immunity would render their entire rationale void, hence they're downplaying it.</p>

<p>You are right that it's complicated but to my knowledge people who already had covid were not included in the clinical trials, so was this a gamble by doctors?</p>

        <p>My thinking is that it's because so many people "had" covid based on a PCR test or are presumed to have had it asymptomaticly. Using the logic that's applied to every other virus before Covid, we would assume that their bodies never really developed proper antibodies because they had such "mild" reactions.  So those people wouldn't be protected and would need the vaccine.  People who did have a symptomatic response to the Covid virus and who fought it off should have long lasting (10+ years based on followup studies of SARS-COVID-1) antibodies and should not need a vaccine but to acknowledge that would be to admit that asymptomatic cases were not real and that PCR testing is flawed.</p>

        <p>Because it is cheaper and faster to vaccinate everyone than to test and vaccinate them. Demand was through the roof. Some people were waiting in their car for an hour. I can't imagine how bad it would have been with testing added. </p>
<p>There's also the issue of false positives or false negatives.</p>
<p>Plus I'd imagine the people who previously got covid are overrepresented among the group not getting the vaccine anyway, so testing would be less effective.</p>

        <p>So, for starters, the immunity you receive from the vaccine lasts longer and is stronger than the immunity you receive from actually getting Covid. Second, during the trials there were people who had previously had covid in both the placebo and experimental groups, and were all fine, meaning it was tested for those who already have the antibodies. Third, the vaccine is not “experimental” this vaccine technology has been researched and tested for decades, the reason its being used now is because it was very fast to develop due to the nature of the vaccine, needing only the section of rna that makes spike proteins in the virus. And lastly, to reinforce my first point, there is a reason a lot of these vaccines are a two dose regiment, for normal covid infection, your body makes the necessary antibodies but doesn’t produce any memory cells, which are needed for longer term immunity. What the second shot does is reinforce the threat to your immune system to ensure it makes memory cells that help the body quickly make antibodies in the event of an exposure to the virus. Natural immunity is only temporary for this reason, and why everyone, including those who already have some antibodies, should get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Without links to backing science, I have to assume your comment here is too absurd to bother with a comprehensive rebuttal.  But the top of the list is that you assert a novel response that contradicts everything we know about how the immune system works in general, developing <strong><em>BOTH</em></strong> short term antibody responses <strong><em>AND</em></strong> long term T-cell memory based immunity for any significant infectious event.  You also completely contradict the fundamental fact that much of our immunity to ancient viruses like corona viruses in general, is based on genetically inherited, innate T-cell immunity, which is already possessed by probably 50% of any given population on average, and accounts for why so many people <strong><em>were able to mount an effective defense in the first place, with nothing more than a short asymptomatic infection, because they were ALREADY immune and immediately fought the virus away.</em></strong></p>

        <p>How do you know that the vaccine protection lasts longer than protection from recovery? All we really have information for is that both natural and artificial immunity last at least a year assuming vaccine trial information is accurate - not enough time has passed to measure beyond that. There's some evidence that natural protection lasts many years (people who recovered from the very similar SARS-1 are still protected 17 years later) but that's a related virus, not the same one, so it's not proof.</p>
<p>Also, natural immunity fights more parts of of the virus than just the spike protein. If the spike protein of a variant is the same then it won't matter which type of immunity someone has; if it changes, natural immunity should be more protective.</p>

        <p>Because the vaccine triggers the biggest immune response. That's why some people are getting side effects.</p>
<p>People who catch Covid will either catch a small dose (not enough for a big immune response) or a huge dose (which will overwhelm their system and leave no lasting immunity). Only a few will actually get the correct immunity - the ones who happened to get the "perfect" dose of the virus.</p>
<p>That's reasonably unlikely.</p>
<p>The vaccine has been built to give the perfect immune response, so, in the overall population, will provide much greater immunity for the maximum time possible.</p>
<p>Plus it'll protect against the variants, which the Covid virus itself may not do.</p>

        <p>This isn't factual David. </p>
<p>you're proposing a hypothesis - which is great, but stating it is as fact isn't accurate.</p>
<p>&rt; Because the vaccine triggers the biggest immune response. That's why some people are getting side effects.</p>
<p>What is the "perfect dose" ?</p>
<p>How is the perfect dose for one person the perfect dose for a different person?</p>
<p>Most drug prescriptions would be tailored to the patient. A large middle aged male, will require a larger dose of drug than a small child. Because of their body mass.</p>
<p>Yet vaccines are administered with a universal dosage.</p>
<p>Is this optimum? or has there been a trade off?</p>
<p><strong>Natural immunity always has the potential to be better than vaccine induced immunity.</strong> </p>
<p>I admire your posting - you're pushing your information, and you are very polite, but <strong>what you are writing is wrong</strong>. Sorry.</p>

        <p>I'm afraid you're wrong.</p>
<p>I'll just quote a few things</p>
<p>"We did a paper 6 months ago which studied people who had died from COVID. So this was a very serious disease. And their lymph nodes had no germinal centers, which means no memory B cells to SARS-CoV-2. Even though they had antibodies, they had very low affinity antibodies.</p>
<p>And so the outcome of that was the idea that if you have a very serious disease, then you're not likely to have a long memory response. Now, those are people who died. So we don't know how it applies to people who have lived because they were able to take out their lymph nodes and study them. And it's not so easy to do in people who have survived. So a natural infection can have consequences. So, on the one hand, yes, you make a lot of viral proteins and those are great epitopes for mainly T cells because I think most of the antibodies that are going to block infection are going to be spike directed. But any other viral protein could in theory be a T-cell target. So you'll get more epitopes.
The counter view is that the virus may encode immune antagonists that could alter the immune response in some way that's not as good as, say, a vaccine. So it really depends. And we don't know enough yet. So I think if people are making a blanket statement that natural infection is always better, that's not always correct. It really depends on the virus."</p>
<p>" Volunteers who received the Moderna shot had more antibodies — one marker of immune response — in their blood than did people who had been sick with Covid-19."</p>
<p>" Natural immunity from the coronavirus is fortunately quite strong. A vast majority of people infected produce at least some antibodies and immune cells that can fight off the infection. And the evidence so far suggests that this protection will persist for years, preventing serious illness, if not reinfection.
But there is a “massive dynamic range” in that immune response, with a 200-fold difference in antibody levels.
In people who are only mildly ill, the immune protection that can prevent a second infection may wane within a few months. “Those people might benefit more from the vaccine than others would,” said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The diversity in the immune response from natural infection might be because of differences in the amount of virus to which the person was exposed."</p>
<p>https://www.contagionlive.com/view/immune-response-from-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-is-more-robust-than-natural-infection</p>
<p>The antibody response induced by mRNA vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is stronger and more variable than that of natural infection, a new study found.</p>

But any other viral protein could in theory be a T-cell target. So you'll get more epitopes.</p>
<p>So - an epitope - this an antibody - for a different part of the virus, not just the spike protein.</p>
<p>Imagine you're needing to pick out a suspect in a police line-up.
You've seen a photograph of the suspect's nose. Perhaps its a very distinctive nose, you think you'd recognise that nose anywhere - its a viable strategy, but you accuracy will not be as high as when you see the complete face.</p>
<p>The same is true with your immune system, a natural infection allows your body to respond to the complete virus, not just the spike protein (nose) </p>
<p>You are eliciting T-cell immunity, not just B cell immunity. An effective immune response requires both pathways. T-cells regulate B-cells.</p>
<p>&rt; The counter view is that the virus may encode immune antagonists that could alter the immune response in some way that's not as good as, say, a vaccine.</p>
<p>And does it?</p>
<p>His <strong>theory</strong> is banking on that making spike cell specific memory B cells produces spike protein antibodies and these antibodies can prevent spike protein binding to your cells, and that is sufficient, or more desirable.</p>

        <p>Lol. The saying was "it's a different coronavirus than all the others" for the full year, now you say it's almost the same az 50 years ago?</p>
<p>Maybe the only difference is that this one is GMO and was made in a lab (very probable).</p>

        <p>There's multiple posts, this was the most recent</p>
<p>I'm afraid you're wrong.</p>
<p>I'll just quote a few things</p>
<p>"We did a paper 6 months ago which studied people who had died from COVID. So this was a very serious disease. And their lymph nodes had no germinal centers, which means no memory B cells to SARS-CoV-2. Even though they had antibodies, they had very low affinity antibodies.</p>
<p>And so the outcome of that was the idea that if you have a very serious disease, then you're not likely to have a long memory response. Now, those are people who died. So we don't know how it applies to people who have lived because they were able to take out their lymph nodes and study them. And it's not so easy to do in people who have survived. So a natural infection can have consequences. So, on the one hand, yes, you make a lot of viral proteins and those are great epitopes for mainly T cells because I think most of the antibodies that are going to block infection are going to be spike directed. But any other viral protein could in theory be a T-cell target. So you'll get more epitopes.
The counter view is that the virus may encode immune antagonists that could alter the immune response in some way that's not as good as, say, a vaccine. So it really depends. And we don't know enough yet. So I think if people are making a blanket statement that natural infection is always better, that's not always correct. It really depends on the virus."</p>
<p>" Volunteers who received the Moderna shot had more antibodies — one marker of immune response — in their blood than did people who had been sick with Covid-19."</p>
<p>" Natural immunity from the coronavirus is fortunately quite strong. A vast majority of people infected produce at least some antibodies and immune cells that can fight off the infection. And the evidence so far suggests that this protection will persist for years, preventing serious illness, if not reinfection.
But there is a “massive dynamic range” in that immune response, with a 200-fold difference in antibody levels.
In people who are only mildly ill, the immune protection that can prevent a second infection may wane within a few months. “Those people might benefit more from the vaccine than others would,” said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
The diversity in the immune response from natural infection might be because of differences in the amount of virus to which the person was exposed."</p>

<p>The antibody response induced by mRNA vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is stronger and more variable than that of natural infection, a new study found.</p>

        <p>That wasn't a study on the vaccines. It says so itself. It says having Covid offers some protection. No one is saying otherwise.</p>
<p>I'm saying vaccines offer better protection, and this study literally says "we didn't look at the protection offered by the vaccines" and the doctor is charge says "don't misinterpret these results.</p>
