        <p>Depends on your definition of crunching numbers. You going to use raw numbers or percentages? Been down this road before. I've wasted countless hours processing CDC data and plotting it out. I see no difference between locking down and masking up as opposed to no measures. You cannot compare countries to one another for two  reasons: 1,) Everyone's definition of a covid death is different. In the US they've incentivized it. 2.) Everyone's population density is different.</p>
<p>Are you not the least suspect influenza all but disappeared? Are you going to use the convenient excuse that masks and lockdowns work? If so, please apply that thinking as to why covid still spreads.</p>
<p>So either A.) Everyone is a lying, virtue signaling sack of crap in public or B.) Viruses spread no matter what you do to try and prevent it. You cannot stop/slow the course of nature. Had everyone paid attention in bio class and taken school a bit more seriously, they'd be better critical thinkers and we wouldn't be in this "I love the science" rubbish.</p>
<p>If it helps you sleep better at night, more power to you. I'd suggest researching every major change event in history. We've been down this road before, we give up our privileges and told it's temporary (it never is), and it's all for the purpose of fighting an invisible threat in exchange for the promise of safety and security.</p>
<p>This is a battle of logic vs emotions. I suggest you use the former. Both sides are equally misguided on this matter and there is a middle ground. Let people decide what risks they want to take. Simple as that. It's not your choice or my choice or anybody's but their own. Stop working so hard trying to be on the "right side of history" because it doesn't exist. To someone else you're on the wrong side. It's all subjective. But feel free to play your statistics. I expect cited sources.</p>

        <p>That was a lot, but I have been on a similar road. You think in absolute black and white, you think that EVERY MEASURE HAS TO BE 100 PERCENT EFFECTIVE TO BE WORTH A SHOT. This virus has a 2% death rate, if that doesn’t seem like a lot then imagine 100 skittles but two of them would explode with the same lethality as a grenade upon contact with your saliva.</p>
<p>Think of these measures as eating different amounts of these skittles, masks alone as eating 25, masks and social distancing as eating 10 or 15, vaccinating (only real side effect if you’re not allergic is a little ouchie for a few hours) as eating 5, and quarantine as eating no skittles.</p>
<p>Think if someone has a chance of offering this bowl to you and once you have it you have to eat said selected amount of skittles for two weaks and you have a chance of having to pass it to someone else.</p>
<p>This is a candy explsion analogy of this virus and it’s measures. 2% is a lot when dealing with big numbers.</p>
<p>And I hate the us government but I’m not gonna make shit up they’re too divided and shaken to do.</p>

        <p>You don't hate the fucking government you love it. You are the very definition of a bootlicker. The people that put these retarded covid measures in place don't even believe the shit they are preaching. Pelosi, that beatlejuice looking chicago mayor, Cuomo's brother...all been caught breaking these rules you cling too. Government says you can't go to church but you can go out on the streets and destroy property. Sending your kids to school will kill grandma but CHAZ was the summer of love. I honestly believe you'd let Fauci shit in your mouth if you told you it would prevent covid.</p>

        <p>Making a lot of assumptions here. I'm certain people would follow these measures if they were 50% effective. Since they have minimal ROI and cause more long-term harm they're not worth it.</p>
<p>The skittles analogy doesn't make much sense. The assumption here is everyone who gets the virus dies. You cannot calculate mortality using cases/deaths. The real mortality has more unknowns than you think. You have the unaccounted pool of an untested population and make the assumption they are neither infected nor survivors. The proper mathematical formula to calculate mortality is (total_pop * (total_pop/isolated_pop))/deaths</p>
<p>Now you need to define your unknown of isolated_pop. The other unknown is deaths because dying with Covid is not the same as dying from Covid. Deaths are a highly volatile figure as a definition of a covid death is inconsistent.</p>
<p>I keep my hands in both sides of the fence. They both share the same sentiments.</p>
<p>They both think the other side is brainwashed</p>
<p>They both think the other side is stupid</p>
<p>They both think the other side is wrong</p>
<p>They both think the other side is to blame</p>
<p>They both think they know better than the other side.</p>
<p>They both think they're on the right side of history</p>
<p>They both think they are open-minded</p>
<p>Read Dr. Seuss' Butter Battle Book. (Butter side up vs Butter Side down on toast)</p>
<p>I am someone who accepts risk every day and am a firm believer in the onus  and responsibility being placed on the person and not the government. By employing a nanny state and supporting it paves the way for more restrictions and scrutiny.</p>
<p>I don't care about making people feel good because they're scared. I do however, respect it's their choice to wear masks and socially distance. I choose to accept the risks, but they won't respect my decision. Does covid suck? Yes, but so does Ebola and Tuberculosis (both much more nasty and as contagious)</p>

        <p>No, we don't need them. The vaccine will protect those who choose to get it, so no doubt most people at risk will get it, thus reducing our hospitalisations and deaths to an insignificant level. Those who want protection will have it available regardless of what anyone else does. No need for any checkpoint societies with two tiers of citizens.</p>
<p>And if they do happen, it's because of the government, not us. All of this happened not because of us, not even because if the virus, but because the government chose to do it. It's debatable whether or not the measures we had/have are necessary, but they happened because the government made that decision. It'll be the same with vaccine passports, except they are not necessary and it will be undebatably be an abuse of power.</p>

        <p>First we do, second we’re already in a three tried society because of capitalism, third the measures will be done once this pandemic is done, fourth this is not some two tiered society we’re transitioning to and even if it is it’ll be too damn easy to get to the higher tier to function.</p>
<p>And the roll of a government is for hard decisions that are necessary that a loose collective aren’t going to make on their own, like inspection of food and drugs or income taxes.</p>
<p>And the vaccine passports win undoubtedly go away and it would show a failure to remove outdated laws if they aren’t, not a successful dystopian transition.</p>

        <p>Firstly, would you like to explain to me why they are needed? Why should we get rid of the freedom of choice that is one of the few pillars our society was built on that is still standing? Are vaccines a two way  thing? No. A vaccine stimulates <em>your</em> immune system, making <em>you</em> immune. You could argue herd immunity, but even if we don't quite get there with vaccines, natural infection will finish the job (which will not be harmful as those at risk from hospitalisation and death will be protected by the vaccine, or at least they'll have that option anyway).</p>
<p>Secondly, yes in our current society I understand there is a big and growing divide between the rich and the poor (worsened by lockdowns, I might add), but this is not a tiered society. That's like classes, (a bit like tiered but it's based on wealth brackets and I don't really want to get into that but while it's a problem it's a different problem, can't figure out how to put it exactly) which although aren't so clear cut these days are still there. That is a separate issue. Unless I'm misunderstanding what you're saying here, in which case I apologise but you'd need to elaborate. What I'm talking about is having two types of citizens with two different sets of rights and freedoms based on their personal health decisions. That's called segregation, and that's never done any good to our societies or our people. It would be blatant discrimination to segregate people based on a <em>personal</em> decision that could be affected by a number of things including primarily personal risk assessment and belief, (whether religious or otherwise) which is against the law and the rights that belong to <em>everyone</em>. We should be working to try to give opportunities to poorer communities and tax rich companies and people (who put their money offshore to avoid it) rather than using the divide as an excuse to add more divides (much more serious ones, in this case) to our society.</p>
<p>The role of governments is to serve the people. That means they shouldn't be doing things like this which directly hurt people. Notice how when they make these decisions, they do not hold votes or consult the people on what they want, they just go ahead and do what they think is best even though they aren't affected by those decisions nor do they understand the struggles that regular people go through because of them? That doesn't sound like it's driven by what's best for us, and even if they have good intentions that doesn't always mean they know what's best for us either, so blind trust is not in our best interests.</p>
<p>And will this go away? I doubt it. Developing something like this would cost a lot and I think when in place they'd just find other things to use it for to justify keeping it. I don't understand a lot about American politics as I'm not from over there, but the patriot acts was one of these so called temporary things that's still here now, yes? To me, the need to show your medical papers to enter shops and services sounds pretty dystopian to me. The point is, we don't let this happen in the hopes that it's temporary because of the reasons I talked about in point 2 but also because we don't want to risk something like this being here to stay.</p>

        <p>Let’s argue from one paragraph to another.</p>
<p>Firstly YES! They are needed to lower the amount of people continuously dying from this disease, believe it or not a 2 percent death rate is HIGH, this not about limiting your personal freedom to not have cloth over your mouth and nose, this is about grandma’s right to live another month and her friends to do that, and the person who’s almost recovered from cancer or a medical tragedy to not drop dead from an outside virus, for a kid with asthma to not have their lungs absolutely shredded, for the old veterinarian to share his wisdom and for everyone who can fucking die from this to not, and even a small chance you are a part of them. If I was walking around in school and someone shot two percent of the kids in my school that’s a mass shooting. And this is a pandemic with a DEADLY virus.</p>
<p>You got the first part right about vaccines but it’s not just you who matters, it’s also for the people who can’t get it. We can’t get herd immunity through natural means because that would kill a lot of people and overwhelm our already overwhelmed healthcare system even worse, so those who can get it should, vaccines give us herd immunity before the virus does. If the vaccine is dangerous for you you should only imagine what the virus can do.</p>
<p>And the economic part and tiered society part is not worth talking about, a vaccine doesn’t only effect you, it effects the community, and it also effects your family if you’re going to work. A personal choice would include playing with hungry tigers or blacksmithing naked. And absolutely do risk assessments but if you choose to not take the vaccine ABSOLUTELY wear a mask and stay as far away from everyone outside your household as realistically possible, avoid large crowds and parties. The virus doesn’t care about your religion or personal beliefs and you’re making yourself an easy target. </p>
<p>Opportunities for poorer communities and taxes for richer communities are great. Unemployment benefits, welfare for single and lower class parents, universal basic income, medicare for all ect.</p>
<p>The role of the government is that but we also have to do as needed for their help to be any use.</p>
<p>The government needs to be better about updating laws and on making coherent decisions, but we can’t worry about protecting others becoming dystopian until it proves to be unnecessarily harsh. Having to work for $8 per hour while in debt with risk of a virus making it worse for you sounds a lot more scary of a dystopia than one where you need to put cloth on your face or be medically immune to enter a Costco.</p>

        <p>First off, the death rate isn't 2%. It varies by age group as follows:</p>
<p>0-19: 0.003%</p>
<p>20-49: 0.02%</p>
<p>50-69: 0.5%</p>
<p>70+: 94.6%</p>
<p>There is no averaging it out with this virus as it disproportionately targets the elderly.</p>
<p>If these vaccines work, why should people be concerned about covid after getting one? You act as if someone should still be terrified because not everyone has a vaccine, but if theirs works then they are protected. It is an individual thing and does not rely on the community to work. I understand that there are a small number of people who can't get the vaccine who may be at risk, however there is no such thing as a risk-less life and if we try to eliminate that risk by introducing segregation we're risking something that will likely turn out a whole lot worse.</p>
<p>With the vaccine available and the vast majority of people able to get it, there is no reason everyone needs it. The people who choose not to get it are content with the risk and should not be forced to stay home and wear a mask 'for their own good' when they aren't hurting anyone else and know what's best for themselves.</p>
<p>And herd immunity will come. The potential danger with natural herd immunity was of course high hospitalisations and deaths. However, it is clear by now that the majority of these occur in the at risk population, so if they have the vaccine (or everyone who wants one does, and in the situation of having bad health that's probably most anyway), this risk is greatly reduced. For everyone else, the vast majority will experience mild to moderate symptoms and a recovery within a couple of weeks as we know. So hospitalisations will not be at too high a level and deaths will be very low. That herd immunity will then protect the few at risk people who haven't had the vaccine, and if they are concerned about the risk until herd immunity is reached then it is their decision to take precautions for a bit longer.</p>
<p>I really don't understand where the idea that vaccination is a two way thing came from, but it is nonsense.</p>

        <p>Are you seriously not getting anything, WE VACCINATE OURSELVES SO WE DONT KILL THOSE AT RISK! You seriously missed a ton of my point, believe it or not a lot of people at risk ARE VERY IMPORTANT like teachers. And there’s a good bit of young people at risk. This virus has had trillions in losses, and can you please link me a source for those numbers?</p>

        <p>We vaccinate the people at risk so they don't die. If you want the vaccine to protect you, you get it. If they want it to protect them, they get it. It stimulates an immune response to protect you from severe symptoms and death, so logically we give it to those at risk from severe symptoms and death. It disproportionately affects elderly people, but yes younger people with serious comorbidities should be offered the vaccine too as soon as possible. And if people are at risk and can't get the vaccine, then we make allowances to help them rather than force it onto everyone because that's completely walking all over rights, civil liberty, bodily autonomy and other concepts that are very important to a free society. There are ways to help specific people without hurting many others through overreach. </p>

<p>The usa has lost trillions of dollars with this pandemic and needed to give trillions to make sure we don’t starve (I’d be cheaper for everyone to wear a cloth mask than that)</p>

        <p>We've spent trillions, but where do you think that money is coming from? It's going to show up in tax and a ruined economy, these trillions of dollars wasted are going to have consequences. I don't get your point here though. Tourism is a big industry that supports a lot of countries and a lot of people. Closing it is going to hurt people, and not always in a way you can fix by just throwing money at it. And like I said, throwing money at it isn't any kind of solution when it's money we don't even have.</p>
<p>You know what would be cheaper? To give at risk people the option to isolate, to actually try and improve the hospital system (in my country, the UK, it's been falling apart for years and that's not because of 'irresponsible people gathering' or whatever), to get employers to give the option to work from home, paid sick leave (within reason), extra caution in care homes with testing (and y'know, not putting people with covid in care homes until they've recovered) <em>without</em> that caution causing residents to be neglected as they have for the last year and prevented from seeing their loved ones, and basically giving people options so they can take responsibility for their own health and situation instead of forcing people to follow damaging (and sometimes nonsensical) rules 'for their own good' when no one knows what's for anyone's own good except the person in question.</p>
<p>Basically, you can't just shut entire industries and starve people of social contact and meaningful experiences for a year (and more) and expect it to be fine. And then as a 'solution', forcibly bring in segregation and tell people to 'earn their rights' that should've never been taken from them in the first place.</p>

        <p>First the trillions in usd spent we’re thrown at us like the country is a strip club it was spent to make sure that people don’t starve. And I don’t know about you but I actually don’t want this virus to go around and cause a potential fourth wave. I don’t want people to continue dying. I want to say it’s over and go to wherever I want. But we are nearing the end of at least one variant, we can’t give up now.</p>

        <p>Of course I don't want people to die! But people have also died and hugely suffered due to lockdowns. That suffering can't just go on because we're worried there could be a <em>potential</em> fourth wave! We have no control over the mutations of viruses, but we know who's at risk and we know what we can do to protect them, we know how to treat covid, and we know that these measures are causing a lot of damage. "We can't give up now" just says to me that we want all of this to mean something, because as time goes on we're learning that this virus is not as dangerous as we thought, that the consequences of the restrictions are worsening and the thought is beginning to surface that we never knew if all of this was worth it in the first place, and we still don't after all this time.</p>
