        <p>If anyone’s interested in the statistics behind why I’m not getting vaccinated:</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex</p>
<p>For my demographic, males ages 18-29, there have been about 1500 deaths attributed to COVID <em>since March 2020</em>. In contrast, the same chart shows about 70K deaths <em>total</em> for the same demographic over the same time period. That means that if an American male, ages 18-29, died in the past 16 months, there’s a 2% chance it was due to COVID. </p>
<p>In contrast, there were <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/241488/population-of-the-us-by-sex-and-age/">over 23 million Americans aged <em>20</em>-29 in 2019</a>, the most recent I could find. If we assume it’s about a 50-50 split between males and females, that means there’s about 11.5 million American males ages 20-29, which naturally excludes those ages 18-19. </p>
<p>That means that my odds of dropping dead due to <em>dumb luck</em> is about 70K/11.5M=0.61%. I’m not taking an experimental procedure to defend myself against a threat that has a 0.61% chance of killing me.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this, applicable to myself and many others here. Many people in our age group seem to be getting the vaccine simply to keep their job or continue their education. Many of the 18-29’s that I know who lined up for their vaccine in early spring spent the previous year taking the bare minimum of precautions; going out, getting shitfaced, only wearing masks when they absolutely have to; just to take the vaccine with the empty promise of normalcy returning. </p>
<p>Logically it makes no sense for younger people to be coerced into taking it, especially fucking <em>children</em> at that. It’s undertested, it is far from without adverse effects, it doesn’t prevent transmission or infection, it apparently is only good for less than a year, and it appears that fully vaxxed people are still contracting the virus and getting gravely ill. With all that in mind, how exactly does getting the vaccine protect others, or even myself?</p>
<p>Anyways, preaching to the choir here, but I still after all these months can’t wrap my head around it all. Thanks for ur comment</p>

        <p>Hey baby, can I talk you into letting me inject some of my mystery genetic material into you? Don't worry baby, I'll wine you and dine you before I 86 you, er I mean 69 you.  Got some free Krispy Kremes, burgers, and pot here to sweeten the deal. Whatta say, baby? Gonna let me slip you the hot mRNA injection?  It might hurt a little at first goin' in, but you gotta relax, and you'll enjoy it, and it'll feel great in the end. Oh, and tell your friends!</p>

        <p>Shooting up with these extraordinary synthetic molecules is a medical intervention.</p>
<p>But not having vaccine induced antibodies is NOT a medical condition and therefore is not a problem to be solved.</p>
<p>However not intaking adequate amounts of ALL the approx two dozen different ordinary nutrients known to science to be required by the immune system IS a personal health issue that DOES need to be solved.</p>

        <p>You forgot one argument, which sidesteps the need to prove that you can still get and spread COVID even with the vaccine. </p>
<p>To protect others &rt; “Are you vaccinated?”</p>
<p>NO: “Why should I get vaccinated to protect you, if you aren’t willing to protect yourself?”</p>
<p>YES: “Does your vaccine work?”<br>
.&rt; YES: “Then why do you need me to get vaccinated? You should be protected if I get sick.”<br>
.&rt; NO: “If it doesn’t work for you, why should it work for me?” (Insert tree here disputing the theory that vaccines are needed for herd immunity, if you want. Which is ultimately what “we all need to be vaccinated for them to work” boils down to, and it’s completely bogus.)</p>

        <p>Rusty you are a legend and I love your work!</p>
<p>And the CDC tells fully vaccinated to wear masks again.</p>
<p>Its painfully obvious their scope of science is failing hard.</p>
<p>Don't wear a mask wear two.  They don't work they do..</p>
<p>These organisations have consistently done this shit since the start of the scamdemic &amp; all the gullible lapping it up..</p>
<p>Fauci: The CDC Hasn’t Really Flip Flopped at All 🤡</p>
<p>"Two Months Ago, 60 Days Ago the CDC Came Out with The Recommendation That Individuals Who Are Vaccinated Do Not Need to Wear Masks Indoors or Outdoors. Something Has Changed and What Has Changed Is the Virus. The CDC Hasn't Changed. The CDC Hasn't Really Flip Flopped at All." – Fauci</p>
