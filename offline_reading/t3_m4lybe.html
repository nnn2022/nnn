    <strong>I cannot get over the insanity of face diapers.</strong>
    <p><p>This is not normal and it never will be. When I see people with face diapers, I think the exact same thing I did when people started wearing them of their own free will: insanity and paranoia. Normal people just don't act like that because something's going around. </p>
<p>And trying to enforce them is even worse. It's unconstitutional, even for businesses because a business cannot enforce a rule that breaks people's rights. This whole obsession over this insane little object. If you don't have one on, people treat you like a subhuman walking biohazard, but the second you put one on, you are now a "responsible and respectful citizen" I type as I roll my eyes.  </p>
<p>"It's just a piece of fabric!" Yeah? Well then why do you care so much if I wear one? "Because you COULD have it so we should treat everyone like they DO have it, even if they feel fine and asymptomatic spread is incredibly rare!" </p>
<p>To stay healthy, I consider just making good choices and doing normal things all you can do. You know why? Because normal people don't wear a freaking diaper on their face because one more sickness is out there. I swear, it probably doesn't even resonate with some people why they're doing it anymore, just that they do. But making good choices to stay healthy is what I consider all you can do, anything more is just paranoid, like staying away from people and wearing a muzzle. And if they go that far, why does it stop there? Why not a hazmat suit? Who decided what is sane now, and what is still going too far and why did it change? </p>
<p>Bottom line is, the face diapers are pure paranoia of one or more of three things: Fear of getting sick, fear that you are sick even when you're not and you might "contaminate" someone whose sister's husband's brother's friend's grandma is "immunocompromised" or fear of what people might say or do to you for being different. </p>
<p>Come on, people just don't act like this and reroute their lives over something like this. And it makes my blood boil to think that so many people are so happy with their enslavement and the enslavement of others, that just to be in public and do everyday things, they misuse, misinterpret, and abuse the law to get you to change when you want to be who you are and were. Just to do normal things, they expect you to put on this ridiculous thing, all for them. All because THEY want you to and they never gave you a choice. Sitting all high and mighty with those smug looks on their faces, thinking they own your face and get to tell you what to do with it and if you refuse, they say you must not want to come in then. It makes me more sick than anything. Especially businesses. They are made to serve the public, yet now they get to be picky? They should be thankful for anyone who chooses to do business with them, instead of thinking they are above the law and that they can make you break your rights just because you need bread and milk. "You don't want to wear exactly the ridiculous thing I tell you? Then I guess you're choosing to starve to death, but hey, that's not my fault, my hands are tied!" (even though they are the ones enforcing it in the first place and have no right to.) And no, it's not "just like wearing clothes" when people try to pass this off as something normal. </p>
<p>This is NOT normal. It's neuroticism in the highest degree. </p>
<p>The muzzles were and ever remain, insane. Period.</p></p>

        <p>I can't get it over it either. I've been against them since the beginning, when all the news said NOT TO and also when I researched all the studies of how useless they are for viruses PLUS the negative effects of wearing them. I'm so irritated that I can't just up and move, like I did all throughout my 20s, to a more free area. I have a kid and responsibilities now and feeling stuck bothers the shit out of me.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry. I'm pretty stuck, too. I was going to go off to college for my first year this year, but that didn't happen so I'm still at home. The main reason I am against them is for the reason that they're just plain silly and I can't take people seriously. Like...yeah, there's a virus that's a bit different from other viruses. But I honestly don't think people would notice much at all if the news didn't push so much of this fear crap.</p>

        <p>It’s willful and physical submission to the narrative. If no one wore it, we would all forget there was a rampant Rona in the area. </p>
<p>But the mask serves as a reminder to the wearer and others that there is no man behind the curtain. </p>
<p>Keeps the questions down too. People are meeting others and discussing their surroundings or climate. </p>
<p>They don’t want the prisoners talking to each other. </p>
<p>One time I made a huge scene about some lady telling me to put on a mask. This was early on so I was a lot less gentle in my handling. </p>
<p>I kept on with my loud protest and she finally blurted out “just don’t talk about it, okay?!?”</p>
<p>There it was. The ego. Manipulated by media and it was their mental leash to a lie.</p>

        <p>Exactly to your first point. Swine flu had the news scaremongering but without the mandated muzzles and no shutdowns or school closures even though it was actually more dangerous to young people who would be in school and out and about... But no masks and everyone forgot about it or didn't care in the first place. The masks literally are the virus. Without them the evidence of everyone's eyes and ears would tell them there is nothing to fear, nobody falling over coughing blood, no neighbors being rushed to the ER. Nothing would induce a fear response.</p>

        <p>I feel like you summed up everything I have been feeling, masks have definitely been the worst part for me too.</p>
<p>The whole thing is sick and I am constantly shocked at how many people get off on how much they love wearing them. Especially the people that wear two masks. I feel like I have no respect for anyone anymore, because I don't understand how basically everyone I know, and the people running the world think this is a good idea? 
I have been in a back and forth with my management at work because I want to wear a face shield at work as a compromise. 
Why am I having to fight for the right to not wear something on my face for 8 hours a day? It's my fucking face lol. It honestly blows my mind on the daily that this is the reality that we are living in right now.</p>

        <p>I just love the editorializing with "face diapers", this is definitely is my new favorite after calling the vaccine "the jab".</p>
<p>It's like you can't help help but put everything in the worst possible light.</p>
<p>&rt;Who decided what is sane now, and what is still going too far and why did it change?</p>
<p>Man, I wonder why new societal norms about potential disease exposure have developed in the last year or so. It's really weird and unexplained. </p>
<p>Do you think the recent coronavirus outbreak has something to do with it? Or is that just a coincidence?</p>
<p>&rt;Bottom line is, the face diapers are pure paranoia of one or more of three things: Fear of getting sick, fear that you are sick even when you're not and you might "contaminate" someone whose sister's husband's brother's friend's grandma is "immunocompromised"</p>
<p>Why are the words "contaminate" and "immunocompromised" in scare quotes? </p>
<p>So you don't care about what could happen if you spread it to other people?</p>
<p>&rt; so many people are so happy with their enslavement and the enslavement of others,</p>
<p>Yes, the current situation is just as oppressive and dehumanizing as being black in the antebellum south, the statement you made is totally reasonable and not hyperbolic.</p>
<p>&rt;All because THEY want you to and they never gave you a choice. Sitting all high and mighty with those smug looks on their faces, thinking they own your face and get to tell you what to do with it and if you refuse, they say you must not want to come in then. It makes me more sick than anything.</p>
<p>I'd say this is pretty clearly more about your little resentments than anything to do with science, evidence, or what the reasonable response to a global pandemic is.</p>

        <p>Still being against mask-wearing at this point is lowkey Eugenics I gotta say. “I trust my immune system” so screw everyone with health issues, basically. Lockdowns are garbage, masks are fine while we’re still dealing with this shit (indoors, with strangers, in public places etc).</p>
