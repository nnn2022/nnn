    <strong>Dr. Fauci is a domestic terrorist</strong>
    <p><p>This thought occurred to me today, so i went to look up the definition of terrorism. There's a few different interpretations of what terrorism is, but general, its "the use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, especially for political purposes.
the state of fear and submission produced by terrorism or terrorization.
a terroristic method of governing or of resisting a government."</p>
<p>While for the most part they aren't using violence, they are definitely using threats and fear to coerce the public for political (disguised as health) purposes. Using fear to govern, for sure.</p>
<p>Am i wrong? Are these claims off base?</p></p>

        <p>Dr.Fauci in my honest opinion, is just the priest for the Corona cult. He advocates nothing but more fear and lockdowns, he's 100% against any type of normalcy returning as well. He's the priest, but in reality he has no actual power like the tyrannical governors such as Andrew Cuomo. In a way, he's worse than him still, because unlike Cuomo, he has a lot of people who believe in him and he is misleading many people with his fearmongering.</p>

        <p>Cuomo is a murderer.  He murdered old people by tossing COVID patients into the nursing homes, and he murdered early COVID patients by using CCP propaganda to brainwash hospitals into hooking up every jerkoff who walked in the door to a ventilator.  Imagine what the NY death rate would look like if he actually got the 40,000 murderators he claimed to need back in March?  He's a killer, and he is directly responsible for his own state's abysmal death count.  He should be locked up in prison mixing hand sanitizer and stamping license plates for the rest of his fucking life.  Maybe toss him in a fed prison and he can be cell mates with Newsolini and Shitmer... the three stooges of the apocalypse....</p>

        <p>You're right. The more I think about it, I believe "terrorism" usually implies some sort of direct violence with physical weapons. He's more of a harbinger of doom and a fearmonger. </p>
<p>Still though, the amount of harm he's caused the general American public vs. the actual good he's done is disgusting. I hope more people will wake up and realize this.</p>

        <p>And he would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for those meddling ... Hmm ... Uh, well, I guess he is getting away with it.</p>
<p>If only we had some sort of a part of society to journal and report about things like this happening, whether it's in the North, or the East, or the West, or the South so everybody could know about it.  Then they'd just stand up against it, since everybody loves liberty and honors the millions of people that have fought and even died to secure our liberties.</p>

        <p>“Using threats or fear to coerce the public for political purposes”.   Doesn’t that describe every government ever?  Isn’t every law also accompanied by the threat of negative repercussions if not followed?</p>
