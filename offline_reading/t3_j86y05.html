    <strong>A question about the content of this subreddit.</strong>
    <p><p>What's so bad about wearing a face covering? It traps the particles if you have COVID, prevents them from getting out, and infecting others. What's your point here? Why is it so hard to just wear a mask? Like, what would anyone gain from you wearing a mask? How does it harm you? I'm not attempting to directly contradict your subreddit, but I'm just curious.</p></p>

        <p>They dehumanize and isolate people on a psychological level. Humans are a social species and need to interact with people face to face. Masks also make it hard for many people to breathe. Furthermore, if they are as effective as they say (which in all fairness-I doubt) then they would in effect potentially harm your immune system by preventing you from catching anything and building up immunity. I mean there is already evidence that certain cold viruses can confer immunity to COVID. Lastly, there have been studies that masks train people to be more obedient and less moral. Masks also make you breathe in more CO2-which could reduce your intelligence. I probably wouldn’t be as concerned about masking if these orders weren’t indefinite in many cases with no end in sight and so all encompassing and tied to the decrees of officials with little to no authority to do so.</p>

        <p>I agree they do isolate people when we are so used to expressing ourselves with facial cues.  It is also hard to recognize people sometimes. </p>
<p>If anyone is concerned about CO2 levels are they not welcome to wear a single layer cloth mask where you are?</p>

        <p>Oh, you mean these?</p>
<p>"Q: What mistakes are other countries making? A: The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks. This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important role—you’ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others."</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/not-wearing-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-big-mistake-top-chinese-scientist-says">Not wearing masks to protect against coronavirus is a ‘big mistake,’ top Chinese scientist says</a></p>
<p>&rt;"One 2013 study looked at how masks could help people with the seasonal flu limit spreading it when they exhale small droplets containing the virus. Overall, researchers found masks led to a more than threefold reduction in how much virus people sprayed into the air."</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cold-flu/mask#research">Does Wearing a Mask Protect You from the Flu and Other Viruses?</a></p>
<p>Another source: <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/09/190903134732.htm">Surgical masks as good as respirators for flu and respiratory virus protection</a></p>
<p>One more: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747">https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747</a></p>
<p>&rt;In meta-analyses combining 6 case-control [29, 31–34, 36] and 3 cohort [20–22] studies (Appendix B, Table 1), use of rPPE conferred significant protection against SARS among exposed HCWs<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;More specifically, wearing medical masks (OR = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03–0.62) (Figure 5B) or N95 respirators (OR = 0.12; 95% CI: 0.06–0.26) (Figure 5C) both reduced the risk of SARS by approximately 80%.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Overall, the evidence to inform policies on mask use in HCWs is poor, with a small number of studies that is prone to reporting biases and lack of statistical power.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15200846">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15200846</a></p>
<p>&rt;We analyzed information obtained from 1,192 patients with probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) reported in Hong Kong.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;frequent mask use in public venues, frequent hand washing, and disinfecting the living quarters were significant protective factors (OR 0.36 to 0.58). In Hong Kong, therefore, community-acquired infection did not make up most transmissions, and public health measures have contributed substantially to the control of the SARS epidemic.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15030685">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15030685</a></p>
<p>&rt;We conducted a case-control study in Beijing that compared exposures of 94 unlinked, probable SARS patients with those of 281 community-based controls […] The use of masks was strongly protective.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Always wearing a mask had a p&lt;0.001, which was by far the single most determinative behavioral trait connected to SARS infection. Washing hands was a close second at p=0.003.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323085/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323085/</a></p>
<p>&rt;On the other hand, using a mask frequently in public places (OR = 0.27, p &lt; 0.001), washing one’s hands &rt;10 times a day (OR = 0.58, p = 0.008), and disinfecting the living quarters thoroughly (OR = 0.41, p &lt; 0.001) during the reference period were significant protective factors</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5705692/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5705692/</a></p>
<p>&rt;The data collected on 3591 subjects in two similar RCTs conducted in Beijing, China, which examined the same infection outcomes, were pooled. Four interventions were compared: (i) continuous N95 respirator use, (ii) targeted N95 respirator use, (iii) medical mask use and (iv) control arm. The outcomes were laboratory‐confirmed viral respiratory infection, influenza A or B, laboratory‐confirmed bacterial colonization and pathogens grouped by mode of transmission.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Rates of all outcomes were consistently lower in the continuous N95 and/or targeted N95 arms. In adjusted analysis, rates of laboratory‐confirmed bacterial colonization (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.21‐0.51), laboratory‐confirmed viral infections (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23‐0.91) and droplet‐transmitted infections (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.16‐0.42) were significantly lower in the continuous N95 arm. Laboratory‐confirmed influenza was also lowest in the continuous N95 arm (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.10‐1.11), but the difference was not statistically significant. Rates of laboratory‐confirmed bacterial colonization (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33‐0.87) and droplet‐transmitted infections (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.25‐0.72) were also lower in the targeted N95 arm, but not in medical mask arm.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;N95 respirators, as “airborne precautions,” provide superior protection for droplet‐transmitted infections. To ensure the occupational health and safety of healthcare worker, the superiority of respirators in preventing respiratory infections should be reflected in infection control guidelines.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;An important finding of this analysis was the efficacy of N95 respirators against droplet‐transmitted infections. Generally, medical masks are considered sufficient for droplet‐transmitted infections such as influenza.18 However, this study has demonstrated a clear benefit of using N95 respirators (both continuous and targeted) to protect HCWs against droplet infections and does not show significant protection of medical masks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2440799/</a></p>
<p>&rt;Opportunistic data collected during the SARS epidemic in Asia suggested that population-wide use of face masks may significantly decrease transmission of not only SARS but also influenza<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;face mask type had a strongly significant independent effect on protection (p&lt;0.001)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;FFP2 masks provided adults with about 50 times as much protection as home made masks, and 25 times as much protection as surgical masks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322931/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322931/</a></p>
<p>&rt;It was found that a 50% compliance in donning the device resulted in a significant (at least 50% prevalence and 20% cumulative incidence) reduction in risk for fitted and unfitted N95 respirators, high-filtration surgical masks, and both low-filtration and high-filtration pediatric masks. An 80% compliance rate essentially eliminated the influenza outbreak.</p>
<p><strong>And hey, it also protects the person wearing it!</strong></p>

        <p>Also, although a lot of us don’t agree with masks, many of us still wear them when we are in public places just to be respectful of those who are truly scared. </p>
<p>I LOATHE masks. But, I am not a jerk about it. I wear my mask at the grocery stores, etc. I’m not happy about it, I find it dehumanizing and even filthy. I do not buy boxes of disposable single use masks. I have a stash of cute masks I bought over the months and literally just stuff them back into a baggy in my purse when I am done. Tell me how sanitary is that? And I know I am not alone. </p>
<p>There was a post from the California(I believe?) government asking people when eating out, to pull their mask down for each bite of food and then pull it back up. Hmmmmm</p>
