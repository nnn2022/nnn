        <p>I work in a Covid-19 IMCU/ICU and all of our doctors agree. I've seen it with my own eyes <em>every single shift</em> since I started working there three months ago. The typical Covid-19 patient is male, overweight/obese, 65+ years old with multiple underlying conditions. The vast majority of the younger patients (20-60) that I've encountered have had one thing in common: A high BMI. You're almost shocked when a normal weight patient appears.</p>

        <p>That is very interesting. My sister is a nurse and works in cardiology, and she’s also seen some evidence of this as-well. They usually have heart conditions and are overweight. Granted, she hasn’t had many covid patients as she’s in post-op, but it’s still interesting to see the correlation between weight and Covid severity. Do you think the severity of symptoms are correlated to the excessive fat? Or is it the underlying conditions caused by the fat that causes the severity of covid?</p>

        <p>Very interesting, indeed! I think it's a complex question, but if I had to guess from my empirical experience I'd say it's a mix of both. The excessive weight has caused several underlying conditions (Diabetes type 2, heart conditions et.c.) which exacerbates their Covid symptoms and makes them less likely to pull through. The increased amount of body fat also makes it harder for them to lie on their stomachs, which makes them unable to ventilate adequately (even with high-flow O2). Excessive fat can also press on the trachea and/or other vital organs.</p>

        <p>And if you believe they must be trusted, you must support everything they say?  This is of course foolish, because they have contradicted themselves countless times.  There is ample cdc commentary on the uselessness of masks and the recommendations AGAINST closing schools for more than a week or two or locking down healthy people.</p>
<p>But you're missing the point entirely, of course, which is that if you think one group does listen to the cdc mindlessly, quoting them should carry weight.  It won't though, because those who mindlessly follow authority will also mindlessly ignore contrary evidence from the same sources.</p>

        <p>The CDC reports research. Research isn’t black and white. They are reporting ongoing research, which isn’t set in stone.</p>
<p>You can’t hope that the CDC would know everything about the virus and vaccines from day one right? They are studying it. New things come and go. Contradictions are good, as it moves us closer to the truth. We are seeing the scientific method play out. The same method got us the polio vaccine, penicillin, organ transplants, antibiotics, the list goes on. It even got us to the fucking moon. It’s the reason why we have phones and computers. </p>
<p>The beauty of science is that it is true whether or not you believe in it. You don’t have to support what they are saying. However it doesn’t matter if you do or don’t, it is true regardless. </p>
<p>It’s almost to scientists credit that there is such blatant deniers of science. They have made things so good that we take things for granted. The invention of the vaccine saved millions upon millions of people across the world. That wasn’t a mistake.</p>

        <p>The CDC also writes recommendation papers and sets policies.  If they can't remain consistent, or at least show WHY a policy changed with concrete evidence, they're useless as a policy body.</p>
<p>This virus wasn't ever actually particularly novel or different.  We have studied many varieties and strains of coronaviruses, even that suspiciously-similarly named sars-cov-1.  We know how these spread, we know what protections masks offer (little to none in a population).  But without being able to point to a body of new evidence, the policies flip-flop.</p>
<p>The trouble with science, as the layman understands it, is that he doesn't.  He points to someone he's told is an expert, and believes that person instead.  He doesn't question either the expert, or the source of the recommendation.  When one chemistry nobel laureate says "you can't use PCR to diagnose a disease" but the media either ignores or attacks him, this expertise is lost.  When another man says "two pieces of cloth are necessary to protect us but still don't mean you can open businesses" and the media says "trust this man!" you do.  You do not question how these masks work, or what certifying body specifies the manufacturing processes and certifies them for medical purpose, you just BELIEVE.  And science cares not for your belief, it demands proof.  Which is sorely lacking.</p>
<p>You are, of course, thinking of the same scientific method that brought us DDT, thalidomide, asbestos, and the 2009 swine flu vaccine that was rushed and harmed so many children (thanks to Fauci...).  Science is fraught with mistakes, so EVERY "scientific" claim MUST be scrutinized, questioned, assessed for bias, malice, and incompetence.  To fail to do so is to treat science as religion.</p>

        <p>That is a good point that they should show why they are changing policy. I completely agree that transparency should be a priority. They aren’t perfect by any stretch. </p>
<p>I completely agree that every scientific claim must be scrutinized. That is, in-fact the scientific method. My point is that unless you are actually doing a rigorous scientific study and getting it peer reviewed and published, it’s all speculation.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818">Here</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext">here</a> are papers on mask usage. Currently there is no empirical evidence that face masks are effective against covid. However these papers are a systematic approach that both show a correlation between mask usage and a dropping infection rate. Definitely more evidence is needed, but these early findings are telling. </p>
<p>If you have evidence on the contrary, I’d love to see it.</p>

        <p>The difficulty with ANY of these studies (I haven't checked those two yet, they're not coming up with my current zealous blocking of JS and cookies) is that they rely on completely unreliable data collection.</p>
<p>If your case counts do not adjust for testing volume, testing strategy (who is tested, and why, and when, and how many times), the seasonality of the disease, and the fact that PCR is not a proxy for an actual case of a disease, what exactly is it they are measuring?  There are some studies with impeccable math that rely on "we got our data from the crowd-sourced covidtracking website" which should be an embarrassment to real academic journals.</p>
<p>CDC's own published study showed a "negligble" impact from mask mandates across the country (yes, mandates, not usage).  The infamous danish mask study showed quite conclusively that masks do not protect you.  (Many will jump on the "my mask protects you" slogan, but this isn't backed by <em>anything</em>.  N95s are solely designed, tested, and certified to protect the wearer (and are a nightmare to get and maintain a quality seal even with training, practice, osha fit testing, and a clean shave).  Surgical masks protect patients from droplets, but not the pressure of coughs/sneezes or aerosols.  Cloth masks aren't designed, tested, or certified for any medical purpose whatsoever.  "Real" masks that are rated for actual life safety have wide rubber seals around the entire perimeter and big chin cups to aid in keeping a perfect seal, and even those need to be the right shape and size, fitted/tightened correctly, and you must still limit face/jaw/neck movement and be relatively cleanly shaven.  But when you know a single breath of air in, say, a burning room could destroy your lungs and suffocate you, you care about a real seal, and you have a mask with that in mind.  Military gas masks don't rely on ear straps to keep soldiers safe either.  Look up SCBA and N95 fit tests on youtube, there is some fun equipment to show you exactly how much is slipping by your seal, and thus exposing you.)</p>

        <p>So basically there isn’t enough evidence to say conclusively that they are ineffective. The papers I provided didn’t use data from a crowd sourced covid tracking website. Data was obtained from SARS-COV-2, betacoronaviruses, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (never heard of the last two) from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19 specific sources. Data was obtained with no restriction by language, feasibility, resource use, and equity. They screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. </p>
<p>Remember when you said “to fail to do so is to treat science as a religion”? You’re literally just speculating on most of your claims. </p>
<p>My view is that we simply do not have enough evidence to prove conclusively that masks are 100% ineffective against infection of covid. We DO have some systematic evidence that masks do help stop infection rates. </p>
<p>The danish mask trial is definitely evidence that supports masks not being useful. However, it is not enough to conclusively argue that they are useless. We need more data before that happens. If anyone tries to argue conclusively either masks are effective or ineffective against infection, that person is treating science as a religion. There isn’t enough data.</p>
<p>My view is that why risk it? If you had to spend the day in a room with someone with covid, would you wear a mask? </p>
<p>It’s better to take action and get people to wear masks, rather than risk it and possibly have infection rates higher. Later when more data comes out and says masks are effective, great! If data comes out that says they are useless, sure, we were all a little uncomfortable, but it isn’t a big deal. That beats saying no masks, because if it turns out they are useful and we don’t  wear them, people die. </p>
<p>We are in a pandemic. We can’t expect anyone to have all the answers. They’re doing the best with what they have.</p>

        <p>Just like lockdowns, if masks had no downsides, you'd be right, wear them because it can't hurt, and might help.  But masks do actually have downsides, from helping to carry oral/facial bacteria to the lungs, to neglected brain development for young kids requiring seeing faces and expressions/speech, to the psychological impact of not visually interacting with people and smiling every day.  I'm pretty sure we'll find that many of these cloth masks are fairly poorly made and people are inhaling microplastics and fibers in to their lungs as well, given enough time.  And of course the environmental impact.</p>
<p>Given those and other risks, and no evidence that masks are effective in the wild at either slowing the spread of a disease nor actually saving lives (because there's no reason to assume that a slower spread would save lives), we must, given incomplete information all around, still decide on a course of action.  Science can help us learn and study, but at the end of the day, we still need to make decisions about how our lives are impacted, and this one is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>For both masks and lockdowns, we have some evidence they're not helping, and ample evidence that they're doing great harm.</p>
<p>&rt; We are in a pandemic</p>
<p>Citation required.  At this point the WHO has redefined 'pandemic' (in 2009), 'herd immunity', and even 'sick' to mean "not sick, but has some viral RNA present."  Prior to these redefinitions, aside from the media screaming, there wouldn't be any reason to think we were in a pandemic.  "Case" counts are medically meaningless and mortality has dropped to or below baseline all around the world.  By what possible definition are we in a pandemic?</p>

        <p>I’ve thought more about it, and I can kind of agree with your side. The environmental, social, and potential health hazards of wearing a mask are definitely factors to consider. I’ve changed my stance from they should be mandatory to you should have a choice. </p>
<p>I disagree that we aren’t in a pandemic however. The entire world has been affected by this. The case count or mortality hasn’t dropped below baseline. For young healthy people, sure. But for the immunocompromised it’s undeniable that they are getting majorly affected by this virus. 
Sure, it’s not as deadly as other pandemics in the past, but it definitely has affected us greatly.
Regardless, whether or not it is a pandemic really just depends on how you define it. We could argue for days about that lol.</p>
<p>I think covid has revealed some glaring weaknesses in our current system. When the lockdowns first started, we had a massive supply shortage because everything is made in China. They didn’t even have enough masks for people in healthcare. We have been trying to increase profit margins to the max, without any regard on its affect of our greater economy. Same thing with healthcare in the US. I’m Canadian, so I don’t have to worry about that. In the US however the system is so corrupt I can’t even understand how it still exists. $300 for insulin?!?!? Are you kidding?? People pay thousands of dollars a month for private insurance that doesn’t even cover most health expenses!? I’ve seen people with 6 figure hospital bills that I would get the same treatment for free. It’s unbelievable. So I’m hoping for the population of the US’s sake that covid will help change the system. </p>
<p>I think we are lucky that Covid isn’t that bad. Imagine if it had a 10-20% mortality rate. The system wouldn’t be able to handle it. Millions would die. It’s also shown how businesses are being run so poorly some go bankrupt in a week or two without any income. </p>
<p>Complete tangent, but I think a universal basic income is a perfect solution for so many of these problems. It has been shown that it increases quality of life, improves job quality, reduces stress, decreases hospital visits, improves health and happiness, etc. I hope covid will be the catalyst for some of these changes so that we can come out better than we were before.</p>

        <p>Countries with universal healthcare are not doing any better than the US, and in many cases worse.  How's your country's case backlog for surgeries now?  Years, if you check.  The financial setup for healthcare in the US is indeed pretty fucked, and worse now than 15 years ago, but our emergency management policies are actually pretty stellar.</p>
<p>I'm not touching the UBI discussion, there have been no real trials to provide sufficient data there.</p>
<p>edit: the supply access is really interesting.  We have extensive strategic reserves of a lot of stuff, but we'll never correctly guess all possible needs.  I think the biggest problem with ANY emergency is toning down the hype, not ramping it up.  Every message was "you must PANIC" and that makes everything worse.  Even in a massive ebola outbreak, or smallpox, or captain trips, panic cannot improve a situation.  Grocery stores wouldn't have been stripped if people just kept buying what they needed for usual schedules.  But US media even more than the rest lives on fear.</p>
