    <strong>Bedtime Theory</strong>
    <p><p>I used to be pretty active on this sub until one day I posted something in my local sub about being depressed about the state of the world and our city in particular, only to be torn to shreds by everyone there after my post history was parsed through. It all happened at a really vulnerable moment in my life, so instead of fighting, I cried, contemplated suicide, quit Reddit and got a therapist. Anyway, hi again, nice to be here. </p>
<p>As I was falling asleep last night, I was thinking about the “vaccine” and listing off potential ways I could be exempt from it if it really comes down to it. To be clear, I’m never going to get it and I will die fighting to not get it before I get it. </p>
<p>But, sometimes, it can be nice to have an arsenal of info to fight back with instead of a simple, “no, don’t want it” (which should be enough of a reason, but we all know what kind of times we are living in). </p>
<p>Anyway, my thoughts meandered to the many frankly scary anecdotes from women about problems with their menstrual cycles after having the “vaccine”.
This led me to the fact that I have Rh negative blood and having been told that if I mate with an Rh positive person, the potential is there that my Rh negative self could attack the placenta of my fetus.
Then I thought about the former Phizer C-whatever-O warning about possible miscarriages due to the vaccine, and the possibility of “vaccinated” cells attacking the placenta.</p>
<p>This morning, I started to read extensively about how people with O- blood types have a much lower risk of getting the virus. Their bodies are naturally able to quickly form antibodies against the virus. The consensus seems to be there despite some papers trying to say that there is no link (which, I hate to say seems to be a bit of a attempt to stamp out any potential inequality stuff, as Rh negative people tend to be white).</p>
<p>So... I’m going to continue reading and researching my bedtime hypothesis but something in all of this is telling me that there is a link here and there might be a problem with Rh negative people and the “vaccine”. As in, if you are already able to fight the virus on your own, introducing something into your body that is supposed to do that for you might be really bad. </p>
<p>I’d love to hear anyone’s thoughts here, especially if you know more about what I’m trying to say and might be able to tie these things together better than I can. I’m fairly intelligent, well-read, and a decent critical thinker (I think), but I’m a fashion designer and artist, not a blood protein scientist after all.</p></p>

        <p>I have O+ blood and am completely naturally immune to covid after 2 minor infections with it. A third time I spent 7 days quarantining and sharing a bed with my then gf who was confirmed covid and lost her sense of smell, I did not get sick at all and now assume I’m completely immune.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah!  I forgot to mention the part about people being naturally immune to it after an infection. A thing that the world seems to have forgotten.</p>

        <p>My wife is O+ and she had zero symptoms after being diagnosed with COVID, if she didn't have to get mandatory tests for her work she would have never known. I'm A+, never got tested but I did get a weird itchy rash for 3 weeks some time after my wife tested positive, but that could have been a side effect of St. John's Wort rather than COVID, I didn't have any other symptoms.</p>

        <p>Hi everyone, I’m really depressed.  Everyone tears you to shreds.  And those are supposed to be the people who care so much about everybody else.  Fuck them.  Glad you’re back, we needed you.  </p>
<p>Very interesting blood type research there.  It would be fascinating if that led to something real.  Ultimately our rulers won’t care, but we will</p>

        <p>Thanks! Yeah, that was weird. I posted it anonymously because I can’t talk to the majority of my friends about how I feel because, well, let’s just say there is a good chance that some of them were the same people anonymously tearing me to shreds. </p>
<p>Yeah, I wish there was more to read that would actually back up what I’m thinking, but I’ll keep digging. I can’t and won’t say I’m certain about what I think, but often my best and clearest thoughts come when I’m in bed, beginning to drift, as counter-intuitive as that may seem.</p>
