        <p>You're on the wrong side of this one bud. The people and institutions you blindly trust have deceived you. I can tell you that taking an experimental and unapproved injection is not smart, it's irrational.. But you're not going to listen to me. You'll just have to figure it out for yourself. See, I know what kind of people run the pharmaceutical industry, and there's no way I would take their sketchy ass product. I'll take my chances with the man-made virus they've let loose.</p>

        <p>What blind trust?  Science is the antithesis of blind trust.  </p>
<p>You don't have to trust the people that run the pharmaceutical industry.  The results of the clinical trials were peer-reviewed, published, and accessible to anyone including yourself. The FDA was transparent in the approval process (it was approved, hence the EUA) and had a live stream of the panels.  This same process was repeated in a myriad of other countries.   Since then there have been several large-scale population studies conducted by other scientists that back up the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.  The CDC and FDA have monitored the rollouts and continue to do so.  They even set up the VEARS system for public reporting and have made that accessible to the public as well.  When there were 6 odd cases of blood clots and 1 death out of 7 million J&amp;J inoculations, the FDA paused the rollout to investigate. The media made a huge deal over this pause and it was on the TV for days.  After finding no substantial link, the FDA allowed the distribution to resume.  I would hardly call any of this "blind".  I don't know how it could be more transparent.</p>
<p>Also remember, the pharmaceutical industry didn't have to produce product.  Several of them were paid in advance by the world's governments for R&amp;D and for the first set of inoculations before completing clinical trials.  This was through programs like "Operation Warp Speed."  Had their vaccines not panned out, they still would have been paid.</p>

        <p>Sorry, I saw this and just HAD to log in.</p>
<p>Let me get this straight... You don't want to put the injection that pharmaceutical companies made into your body... So you will instead catch the thing that pharmaceutical companies made and have it enter your body.</p>
<p>Like even if I follow your logic I can't get my head around it. If pharmaceutical companies want to put some secret sauce into you why not do it with the virus as well? In any case it's clear that there are more deaths from the sickness so even if it is man-made it's like the bad guy threatening to shoot you in the leg or the head... You'd take the leg right?</p>
<p>Plz fix your logic honestly I hate it more than the fact that you are like this.</p>

        <p>Let me get this straight... you don't want to POSSIBLY get a virus with a 99+% survival rate but you're totally fine with a vaccine that's never left its trial phase? A vaccine that works differently than any other vaccines did before it? Something that is very experimental with people getting censored for asking questions or posting their EXPERIENCES with the vaccine, people who have had bad experiences with the vaccine should not be censored if true science is what you're after. You can't pick and choose what parts of the scientific method you want to follow. And you can't keep us from asking questions. Why do y'all get so upset set when we want to double check what's in the needle before we go around making everyone and their young children get an experimental shot?</p>
<p>By your logic we should just fully trust the government and the people it pays for 'science' and not have any questions or critical thinking skills of our own....</p>
<p>We just want freedom of information regarding the science and not having doctors kill their career if they speak up to something that concerns them. We want freedom to talk about it without half the internet censoring us, we just want the truth. Not a truth, the truth. And we expect proof. Not this "oh trust us we're the government and we care so much"</p>

        <p>So you're afraid of side affects from getting the vaccine?</p>
<p>And you're also afraid of the vaccine?</p>
<p>Have you read about how any of the various vaccines work? It's <em>a well understood science</em> and the way it works is <strong>very well</strong> understood. </p>
<p>If you haven't, I can give you a gradeschool primer on how the Moderna vaccine works -- </p>
<ul>
<li>I give you a knockoff lollipop.  </li>
<li>The candy coating emits "this is bad" taste to your body, inside of this candy coating is just a normal tootsie-pop. It is harmless.  </li>
<li>Your body makes "this is bad" antibodies to fight anything that has that candy coating that enter your body.  </li>
<li>COVID enters your body by having a shell of candy coating (it has a NAUGHTY tootsie-pop in it).   </li>
<li>Your antibodies attack the candy coating, destroying the protective shell around the (NAUGHTY) tootsie-pop (the virus).  </li>
</ul>
<p>You have "freedom" to talk about something but you're doing it in a way that is clouded in severely misinformed information. It's like saying that eating a Whopper will kill you when in reality eating a Whopper 3x a day for 30 years will likely increase your mortality rate.</p>

<p>In this case the "This is bad" taste is a nucleotide for nucleotide exact copy of the covid spike protein. The spike protein itself can cause a whole host of issues for the body.</p>

<p>Not very honest of you to leave out the most serious concerns. I will give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you are unaware that there are some serious concerns surrounding the spike protein:</p>
<p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension - https://www.mdpi.com/2673-527X/1/1/4</p>
<p>Spike protein contains prion-like domains (these cause dementia) - <a href="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0422/v1">https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202003.0422/v1</a></p>
<p>Neuro degredation -<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X2100499X?via%3Dihub">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X2100499X?via%3Dihub</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889159120315221?via%3Dihub">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889159120315221?via%3Dihub</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-020-00965-3">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-020-00965-3</a></p>
<p>I will add, this is not to say that these are not dangers of covid itself. Just that with the idea of a vaccine being to inject a much weakened or harmless version of the virus then I would not call it much weakened in this case because the spike protein created by the mrna vaccines is <em>entirely</em> unchanged and the spike itself causes potentially <em>lethal</em> issues. Perhaps these concerns are unfounded, but perhaps we need a bit more time spent studying this before we know for sure. </p>
<p>But yes, I'm just worrying about a sore arm /s</p>

        <p>A vaccine that has been researched for three decades. It is not new sure this variation is but that’s true for all vaccines.</p>
<p>Posting your experience is not the “scientific method” in fact it is pretty much the opposite word of mouth is famously and continually the least trusted source.</p>
<p>Third the info is out there on exactly how the mRNA vaccine works. The research on effectiveness and side effects is out there. It’s not just published by the government it’s published by private scientific and medical journals who’s credibility relies on continuing to follow the scientific method.</p>
<p>How can you trust this post is real. I could make a second Reddit account right now and post about how I had cancer and the Pfizer vaccine cured it. Is that the scientific method, is that key data?</p>

        <p>I guess it is a hard thing for someone like you to understand. You can't hide from viruses, lockdowns and shit only prolong the situation. So yeah, I'll take my chances contracting covid AGAIN, even though it's extremely unlikely lol and since I've got natural immunity now, I don't need their shitty injection they're so desperately trying to convince me to take. Why the hell would anyone with a brain take it? Covid kills really old, really fat, and really sick people. I'm none of those things, so the "vaccine" is all risk no reward. Unless you count a donut as a reward, as I'm sure many people do lol.</p>

        <p>What about the people who have medical training and education who spread dangerous misinformation. For example, you probably believe masks work. Do you know that Dr. Fauci once spread the dangerous misinformation that masks for the general public don't work and can actually cause more infections because people touch their faces all the time without washing their hands? </p>
<p>So Fauci should be fired, right? Either he's lying now that masks work or he was lying back then and he caused the deaths who possibly tens of thousands of people?</p>

        <p>So the idea is that you can still get the illness even when you are fully vaccinated, but the effects aren’t felt...</p>
<p>Shouldn’t the vaccine completely stop it so you don’t get it, or I suppose from a financial standpoint if the vaccine worked that way, you’d be cured and the money wouldn’t be spent, if that’s the case, I guess no wonder the vaccine doesn’t work very well, it’s not profitable that way</p>

        <p>Just wanna clear up some science for you. DNA→ mRNA→ protein. To turn RNA→ DNA you need an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which is found only in viruses, not humans. So this vaccine is not and cannot alter your DNA. The vaccine provides instructions to your body on how to produce a protein of coronavirus that is important for infecting other cells. Our body naturally develops immunity against this protein so that it is more prepared to recognize/ destroy it next time it is introduced to your system.</p>

Which is why in my opinion at risk people should get it(edit** assuming they’ve talked to their primary care first and been okayed).  Not at risk people should just decide for themselves….but everyone should talk to their doctor and ask.  My primary care told me “with medication allergies you have, and that you’ve already had covid I wouldn’t recommend the vaccine” thus as of right now I’m not planning on getting it.</p>

        <p>No vaccine has 100% efficacy.  The most recent real-world, large-population I have found for Pfizer/BioNtech says 91.5% efficacy against asymptomatic infections (just a carrier) and 97% against symptomatic infections (COVID). [1]  Last year around this time the FDA said they would approve a vaccine with efficacy as low as 50%.  These numbers are pretty good for a vaccine.  The typical flu vaccine is around 40-60% for the general populace.  </p>
<p>Another factor to remember is that efficacy is measured against 100% transmission and infection.  So if in your control group you have 10% infection but in your vaccinated group you have 1% infection, you would say that that effectiveness is (10%-1%)/10% = 90%.   So this means that the vaccine has a case reduction effectiveness of 90%.  If you take the vaccine, this doesn't mean your chances are 90% less (or 10%).  It means that your chances are now that 10% (100%-90%) multiplied by your chances of having got it originally (that 10% in the control group) so 1%.  Make sense?  I hope this helps. </p>

        <p>Yes. You can. </p>
<p>Just like you can still catch the flu if you've gotten a flu shot.</p>
<p>The entire point is that it both reduces the symptoms and also reduces the chances that you'll infect others.</p>

        <p>Imagine getting a 'vaccine' just to do something you were always able to do in the past. It really makes you sick, and you have to take it multiple times and still you get sick and can't do whatever it was you got the vaccine for in the first place. Big Pharma holds all the cards and you have no legal repercussions to sue them if their jabs have done long-term damage to you. You'd ask yourself what was the fucking point of getting jabbed in the first place, especially over a virus that's basically a bad cold, but you've been duped big time and bought into the biggest con of the century. Tick tock, love.</p>

<p>All those who got the jab are going to test positive because they have the spike protein. No way around it. Everyone one of them would test positive if they used the same high rate on the PCR test as they did trying to sell the Covid lie.</p>

        <p>Yeah and yet everyone I work with, including myself and husband and daughters, all got covid in January (total of 17 of us), yet none of us got reinfected. However, we keep being told vaccine is so much better than natural immunity. Plus want us to still get the shot. Nope. Not for me.</p>

        <p>Here's a question I have.  </p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines are only <em>part</em> of the virus - they in essence are narrowly targeted at one part of the virus.  </p>
<p>Whereas, if you caught COVID it dealt with the whole enchilada.</p>
<p>Why would a very targeted vaccine be better than one with the whole virus or natural immunity?</p>
<p>I've also heard it posited that the specific nature of the mRNA vaccine could put evolutionary pressure on the virus itself.</p>

        <p>From someone trying to convince me to get a vax.</p>
<p>(Context: I asked "If the vaccine works, and you get it, why do you care if someone else doesn't get it?" This person simply could not answer the question. It was like asking an ATF agent "what's the definition of assault weapon")</p>
<p>&rt; The R0 of the coronavirus is somewhere between 2-3. This means that if you get it, you will likely infect two to three other people. In turn, they will also infect 2-3 people. The virus will continue to spread and infect other unvaccinated or vaccinated individuals, many of which will end up in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Infect other unvaccinated or vaccinated individuals</strong></p>

        <p>The vaccine only suppresses symptoms. That makes it an “imperfect” vaccine, which has been <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/tthis-chicken-vaccine-makes-virus-dangerous">proven</a> to cause major problems for the unvaccinated over time. It’s not too much of a stretch to assume that was the plan all along.</p>

        <p>I got the virus back in November, and hardly wore a mask after a month or two. I also didn’t get the vaccine. Two friends of mine developed blood clots after having gotten Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, so I am steering clear. The friend that got the Pfizer vaccine had a blood clot in his liver, and my friend that got the Moderna vaccine had a blood clot in her lungs. They are slowly recovering, but the doctor’s lack of understanding the origins of the clots scares me.</p>

        <p>I tried to catch covid. My boyfriend had it, tested positive with symptoms. I haven’t believed in this shit since good ol’ Tom and Rita came on prime time TV to advertise covid. So I shared his water bottle and kissed him. Not only did I never get sick, I tested negative twice. So I wasn’t an “asymptomatic carrier”. I was just curious, it’s not as contagious as they say. I did it for science. As a nurse, this was the only person I knew who tested positive for covid since the scamdemic in the last 15 months. Go figure.</p>

        <p>I know about 6 people in my family that caught it, two of them in their 70s, one already on deathbed, they were sick with no more than mild flu symptoms for a few days. I asked if it was worse than one of my bronchitis flare-ups, I was told it was nowhere near as bad.</p>

        <p>The censorship is pretty rampant across all the social media platforms. Did a FB live today with Patrick Byrne and General Flynn. The audio is really muffled ( except every 15 seconds it come clear for a second) I understand some folks don’t like these guys but it’s pretty sad for fb mods to be that petty.</p>

        <p>Yep, I was permanently banned for asking a question. </p>
<p>The thing that really makes me sick is that most people going to r/covidvaccinated to tell their adverse reaction stories feel the need to start: "I'm not anti-vaxx or anti-science but... "  The fact that people are so indoctrinated that they are terrified to even discuss the fact that the "vaccine" has damaged them is terrifying. If everyone who has been damaged by a vaccine was allowed to tell their story maybe others might see what a cult it all is.</p>

        <p>Nobody said you couldn't get covid after having the vaccine. You can get a strain that the vaccination didn't protect against. You could have had it in your system before being vaccinated and not known it. Nobody ever said the vaccines were 100% effective. You were probably banned, because you were spreading misinformation and using anecdotal evidence.</p>

        <p>So far for a short period of time with side effects more concerning than any other vaccine I have taken.  If your goal is to get everybody vaccinated, your goal is unrealistic.  You run into issues of bodily integrity and people trying to wait out science's oops factor.</p>

        <p>How many times people have to say it again: The vaccine does not prevent you from getting covid. What it does it protects you from basically dying or laying with a tube in your mouth... So many times it has already been said but you keep on posting this bs.</p>

        <p>A couple of thoughts on this.<br>
1. Why do so many people automatically believe this post to be true? Do any of you know Epicdrummerguy? Can anyone verify it? How can you be sure it isn't made up?<br>
2. No one, literally not one doctor has claimed any of the vaccines are 100% effective in preventing contracting the virus. They are highly effective however. The post even says, "Vaccinated people getting covid are supposed to be 'breakthrough' cases that are 'rare'... " This means that it is not out of the realm of possibility that some will still contract it. How many deaths from covid have been reported from someone vaccinated? I haven't heard of any.<br>
3. While the vaccine is not 100% effective against contraction, it is designed to minimize symptoms and effects of the virus. So instead of getting incredibly sick and going to a hospital and dying, you feel like (some amount of) shit for a short(er) period of time.</p>

        <p>You do realize that everything they claim that the vaccine does, there are handfuls or front line docs (that have been treating Covid patients) that state they have therapeutics that will do the same thing. For me, I'd rather boost my natural immunity with Zinc, Vitamin D, and rely on Hydroxichloriquine and Ivermectin vs an experimental shot.</p>

        <p>For several millions around the world though, the virus ended up not being treatable. I for one received the vaccine, had no ill effects from it and feel better protected against it than hoping I don't contract it being unvaccinated. But I also understand it's a personal choice and would never force anyone to get it against their will.</p>

        <p>Not treatable because of early first line medicinal health care being prohibited. A lot of people suffered and died unnecessarily because of that. Don't you think it's funny, that during a deadly pandemic, infected people are told to do nothing but quarantine, only for this virus to fester, getting people real sick until the point of hospitalization? And even then death toll was exaggerated with all kinds of statistical trickery.</p>
<p>If you feel safer because of being vaccinated is great, as I wish you the best. It's a shame you were tricked into having it.</p>

        <p>Last time I saw Vaers, death toll is almost at 5000  I think. And as only about 1% of cases are reported, the real amount of dead vaccinees should be around 500000, as in half a million. Add to that 85% of covid deaths that could 've been prevented through first line health care and medications (iinstead of just waiting for infected people to get real bad covid to hospitalize them). All those people are dead because politics took over healthcare. It is madness indeed.</p>

        <p>The Reddit user, too afraid to consider the painful, heavy stinging truth, joins others in his attacking comments - anyone who is not going along with the narrative is his enemy.  They must be alienated and insulted. The alternative is simply too much to bear.</p>
