    <strong>People blindly buy into the fear-mongering to ignore clear logic of specific situations.</strong>
    <p><p>Preface this by saying I know the virus is real, but the pandemic is manufactured. I have been directly, unintentionally, exposed to numerous infected people without ever testing positive for the virus or antibodies. </p>
<p>People are so bent out of shape about individuals being exposed the willfully ignore the facts and logic behind it. One of these is sharing a house with a positive person. </p>
<p>A group of friends I have are going on a camping trip this weekend. I have a friend in this group whose roommate is currently positive. This friend got tested on Tuesday, the 19th, as his roommate tested positive on the 14th. Friend got his NEGATIVE results today. However other people in this group are arguing that he shouldn’t go despite being negative. </p>
<p>They are saying “he could still catch it from his roommate”, or “he could’ve caught it since his test”- not even 48 hours ago. If my friend and his roommate have maintained their same distancing, and roommate has not left his room, then how the fuck will my friend catch the virus, if he didn’t get it within 5 days of his roommate testing positive??? We all know if this virus is as contagious as the media and others claim, then surely the virus would’ve gotten to him in 5 fucking days. Sure, longer exposure time could take into effect, but with this virus, we “know” it’s so “contagious and deadly” you’d get it by now... or so they say.</p>
<p>FYI, I’m not my friend, just ranting because three members of our group are on the media koolaid, and I live with one of them so I can’t vent to her.</p></p>

        <p>My roomates girlfriend had it while staying at our appartment, none of us got it (they kissed and stayed together the whole period). My sister had it and lives with a boyfriend, they also slept and kissed while she had it, he did not get it. I dont think anyone can claim that we know how this shit spreads which just makes this even more fucking stupid</p>

        <p>One of the first stories was a couple on a cruise ship where the wife had it, and the husband was forced to stay with her in their single bed room, however he never tested positive, but everyone seems to have forgotten that story.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind the PCR tests have very low accuracy. So even if someone "tests positive", it doesn't mean they can infect others.</p>

        <p>They have nothing else going on with their lives. If they even have grandchildren(unlikely) before this nonsense the only highlights of their lives are their video game accomplishments. Now they can tell stories of how scary it was in the 2020s</p>

        <p>Why are you going to camping in first place if you're all supposedly scared of this virus. Like I don't it. You're not gonna social distance, wear a mask, sanitize rigorously stuff you bring... are you? But no, by some magical express thought, virus will avoid you because excluded that one friend. ???? Since whem do your own madeup rules apply to this lol? Are your moron friends all you have? Stick to the underdog friend, you and him go chill somewhere, leave these self-delusional uppity heads on their own. I have zero friends yet pulling stunts like this would never cross my mind, in fact I would bring homemade soup if any of my friend catch covid or walk their dog, wash their dishes... I'm not afraid of getting sick at all, sniffles, headache, muscle ache, fever... big fucking deal.</p>
