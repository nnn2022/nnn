    <strong>I’ve gotta be honest</strong>
    <p><p>My faith in humanity is starting to get lost, even though we’re starting to recieve bigger wins.   The mindset of the Doomers never seem to change in any meaningful way, they get shown that Masks don’t work and then there logical conclusion is that everyone just needs to stay at home.</p></p>

        <p>Do not hate them for your own sake, too them being hated by us is a form of victory it justifies there ego.   And there ego helps reinforce there preconcived notions regarding Covid, so that when new info comes up it will be even Harder to try and convince them.   Either side acting like they have the complete truth will turn the others away,  so i try to be understanding towards them but it isn’t easy and that is because healthy discourse is a hard task</p>

        <p>Had someone at work tell me they couldn’t go to an office down the hall to use their copier because they heard there was an “anti masker in that office”.

        <p>It's not just the virus. I was driving a few weeks ago and a back road was blocked with a massive tree in the way. People were parked in their cars just staring at the thing and had been for minutes like the tree would jump out of the way or something. There was a random person directing traffic telling me not to go down that way. So I did the only reasonable thing: ignored them and drove up to the tree, put a tow strap on it, and pulled it out of the road with my truck. There was at least 1 other truck there that could have done it and I'm pretty sure most of the passenger vehicles could too.</p>
<p>Once the tree was out of my way I drove down the road the rest of the way and then encountered a police roadblock. Presumably a tree had fallen there at some time in the past but there was nothing blocking the road at that moment except the law enforcement.</p>
<p>Perfect parallel to the virus nonsense.</p>

        <p>I had this same thing happen. Pulled up to a long line of cars to see at the end of it, a downed tree. No one moving, one truck and another guy helping to strap it up and pull it out of the way. Took a matter of 1 min of that truck pulling up on the other side. Sad to say it’s faster than any cleanup crew or police would ever be.</p>

        <p>I think this is the start of something bigger. Being that so many aren’t able to think for themselves, and that after SIX MONTHS we still have these silly restrictions in which the majority of people don’t speak out about, it’s only going to enable more control of higher powers. </p>
<p>I wish I grew up in the time where you didn’t have to warn people that coffee was hot, and that you’re not supposed to put a radio in a tub of water, but look where we are today...</p>

        <p>This is what is frustrating me most.</p>
<p>Everyone is celebrating Florida lifting restrictions, acting as if that means everyone/everywhere is also automatically going to be "freed", and also as if DeSantis will never initiate another lockdown in the future. I just find it difficult to trust any of these politicians, and unless DeSantis forms a coalition with other likeminded governors to try to liberate the entire country or something of the kind, I find it hard to believe he's going to lift a finger to commit to meaningful change here.</p>
<p>There's really three ways this could go, at this point: 1) This is the real beginning of the end. People here are right. The election is end-all, be-all, and this ends as soon as the US election is over. No more lockdowns, not for a long time or ever. 2) The October Surprise will be more lockdowns and/or restrictions. They will use the "second wave" as the excuse, play fast and loose with case numbers, and there will be a longer, stricter lockdown in the works for many locations, US and all over the world. 3) The year will end with the current status quo in place, and maybe a few more states/countries will be "liberated". Then in 2021, they will initiate the next phase which is basically #2 as described above. More societal changes will ensue afterwards.</p>

        <p>They have started to Face more and more resistance.   Recently if they try to implement more restrictions then i think violence will quickly become the only option people will feel that they have left.   So i do not think they have the leverage to try it again since we know a lot more about the virus now then we did 6 months ago</p>

        <p>I'm not entirely sure about that. I see a lot of apathy and complacency with regards to most of the restrictions right now. The protests are allegedly becoming more violent, apparently the Trafalgar one today was according to the media (though one of the comments here basically implied this was not the case). I guess we'll have to wait and see.</p>

        <p>The big elephant in the room not many are talking about here is mass poverty and food.</p>
<p>"Who controls the food supply, controls the people" - Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>No doubt you have noticed mass poverty has already kicked in. Economies are in the gutter. Food banks in many countries now have lines going for miles and we're only in September.</p>
<p>Countries like the US, UK, Australia, China, have already closed down farms and food production factories due to the virus. If this trend continues and they shut down more for longer periods, famines in many countries are coming.</p>
<p>Once the dust settles, governments can mandate any rule to basic necessities people need to survive. People will be desperate. Not got the covid pass? Not got the vaccine? No food or state money for you!</p>

        <p>Well there is no cure for stupidity.  </p>
<p>I think the closest thing too it is studying alittle bit of History and Perhaps following the History of though(Philosophy) besides normal history.    But even then a lot of people i talk too seem oblivious to the fact that we simply repeat our destruction.  Every century give or take.     Like how many failed Communist revolutions must be experience before humanity leaves it behind?  I doubt that will ever happen since Marxist ideas argue very well in regards to peoples emotions.  And logic rarely rules over emotion since we’re all irrational</p>

<p>For me it is too idealistic as an idea.   I find Utopianism as an idea to be inherently destructive.    Marxism would work if we lived in a perfect world without human ego, greed and ambition.   But well i would still rather live in the flawed human one.</p>

        <p>See, this Pandemic is truly terrifying to most of us on either sie of aisle on this. Some people choose to shut their eyes and move on as if nothing happened, while others open them wide and let the fear sink in to the point of panic. Both are extreme over reactions, they are human, and not rational.</p>
<p>I try to be somewhere in the middle, but I realize I am not above fear of the virus and losing people I hold dear (my 72 year old mom comes to mind). And yes I am also afraid of long covid and permanent damage from Covid and so on, which we don't know much about yet (it's neither proven nor disproven).</p>
<p>Some people prefer to err on the side of cautioness, some on the side of individual freedoms. Some have more to lose by isolation than through sickness. People are different.</p>

        <p>Okay first of all, I gave you so much evidence to prove you are wrong and you still won't wear a mask.  And i'm telling you to change your opinion on masks because it's putting people in danger.  Its okay to live your life however you want, as long as it is not hurting other people,  that's why you should wear a mask.  And didn't you say, "Do not hate them for your own sake, too them being hated by us is a form of victory it justifies there ego." and,"they get shown that Masks don’t work and then there logical conclusion is that everyone just needs to stay at home." You are doing the same thing, but with evidence that shows masks work.  But you have to remember that this virus is new and it seems to be 10 times deadlier than the flu: https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/blog/how-covid-19-is-different-and-worse-than-the-flu#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20COVID%2D,H1N1%20swine%20flu%20strain. and these articles are made by medical professionals.  That's why you should trust them.  And you should wear a mask before more people die than the already 204,000 dead people in the U.S.  And why are you taking sources from the CDC, they proved that masks do work, but you don't wear one?</p>

        <p>I respect the time you put into compiling the sources. I also believe if someone wants to wear a mask, they are free to do as they please. If the virus was really as lethal as we thought in March, there would be no need for this conversation. Most everyone would wear a mask out of objective fear of family and friends dropping dead.</p>
<p>The matter of fact is the virus right now is on par with the average flu. See the recent CDC mortality rates. There is no pandemic. Knowing one or two people affected by the virus is not a pandemic. People unfortunately die every second of every day. The leading cause of death is living.</p>

        <p>"I respect the time you put into compiling the sources."  Thank you, not many people acknowledge that. Okay First of all, Covid isn't on the "same par with the average flu".  It is actually 10 times deadlier than the flu, and it's killed more people than the last 2 flu seasons. (You could check my sources for my claims in my previous comments)  And there is a pandemic, 32.6,000,000 people have already been sick.  And how do you think there is not a pandemic, do you have evidence and sources to support your claim?</p>

        <p>I'm going to say outright, I don't trust the numbers of "cases". See examples such as: 
https://www.activistpost.com/2020/09/coronavirus-testing-suspended-at-boston-lab-due-to-nearly-400-false-positives.html
What I do see objectively talking with friends and family is no one getting sick.  Out of everyone my wife and I know 2 people had covid in what turned out to be a mild flu. Both are fine and Invited one of them over at a party I had a few weeks back. </p>
<p>No one else, nothing. We've been ignoring any social distancing nonsense, having people over, hosting parties, seeing a lot of family from both sides,  including my wife's 88 y/o grandma who is doing great. She's funny actually and is more pissed off about the lockdowns then most lol. No masks. Lots of hugs and handshakes. I even went to a pretty crowded bar recently to see an old friend who lives in. Florida. I couldn't believe how many people were there no masks in sight. Good times.</p>
<p>Time to go workout. I know your mind is made up, as for now so is mine (until objective experience tells me otherwise). No point of living in fear of the boogie man who never actually comes out from under your bed.</p>

        <p>"as for now so is mine".  But the problem is what you are doing could endanger someone else, and that's when a mindset should be changed.  So I hope you understand that you were wrong when you said, "No you haven’t proven them wrong you have given me your opinion that there wrong." And, "No point of living in fear of the boogie man who never actually comes out from under your bed."  Do you honestly think we are horribly afraid of this virus?  Because we do the lockdowns to help other people who could be in danger, not because we want control or because we are afraid of us catching the virus and dying.  And, "until objective experience tells me otherwise)"  You don't always need experience to learn something.</p>

That do not share in your pre-established notions.  Which i knew would be the outcome.   Since the Cognitive dissonance would show up rather quickly on your side </p>
<p>Since it’s trust the experts as long as they say what you wanna hear right?   And you’ll find any and all reasons to dismiss any opposing opinion.  </p>
<p>And what a shocker the moralistic emotional manipulations gets put into action, oh but more people will die.    But i can probably guess that would care less about the people that have died from suicide or those that have died due to not recieving medical treatment due to Covid being the only focus.

        <p>"Since it’s trust the experts as long as they say what you wanna hear right? And you’ll find any and all reasons to dismiss any opposing opinion."  I gave you clear solid evidence, but what you have gave me isn't valid, and I have proven them wrong with even more evidence.  But you have not shown me valid evidence that proves me wrong.  So would you trust someone who was known to misinform and has no evidence, but not claims with evidence and credible sources?  "And you’ll find any and all reasons to dismiss any opposing opinion."  Do you want me to lie? I found solid evidence to prove you wrong, and you want me to dismiss that? Why can't you accept you are wrong,  we all make mistakes at one point. It's better to be honest with yourself and everybody else.  "Which i knew would be the outcome. Since the Cognitive dissonance would show up rather quickly on your side". Were you not the person that gave me sources from the CDC, and they tell people to wear masks, but you don't? And Just because we have another focus you think we won't care about other people?  We still have charity around for people not just with covid but with other problems.  We also still have therapists helping people with mental problems.  "But let's not worry about those deaths right?"  You don't even wear a mask, even though they could save other peoples lives, but you don't worry about those deaths?</p>

        <p>I gave you evidence why masks do minimize spread just look at my previous comments and the links. And as if you didn't check the links, the evidence to prove he is wrong are in my previous comments as well, don't be so ignorant.  "and Yeah i’m not responsible for other peoples healthy just like nobody else is responsible for my health."  So you are telling me doctors should just give up on their career because your health  isn't important to them? So Therapists are useless and shouldn't help people with mental problems because "their health is their responsibility"? You say that but you also said, " But i can probably guess that would care less about the people that have died from suicide or those that have died due to not recieving medical treatment due to Covid being the only focus. And what all those millions if not billions that will die from an economic collapse. But let's not worry about those deaths right?"  You just come up with different opinions on every reply you post. You should take care of your health, but when your bad health makes other people unhealthy (Like viruses) that is when you become a danger.</p>

        <p>No it’s not a different opinion.  You just happen to love straw-manning.    And i gave you evidence that disprove your evidence.   So you’re claim of «Evidence» doesn’t mean much</p>
<p>And essentially said oh, us letting those people die doesn’t mean that we do not care about them since Covid is our focus.    Why would i bother re-reading links i have already read when all this nonsense started.    But hey since you’ll just continue twisting everything i say.  Too justify destroying the education of future generations,  the economic collapse and the suicide etc all happening right now.   Yeah you sure are a hero </p>
<p>Also Doctors and Therapist have treating people as there job they get paid for it.  So it isn’t in anyway comparable but lets ignore that right?  They have financial incentive to care</p>

        <p>"Too justify destroying the education of future generations, the economic collapse and the suicide etc all happening right now. Yeah you sure are a hero."  I never justified that, I only said you should wear a mask and protect other people.  I also never claimed I was a hero, I just try to improve peoples lives. "And i gave you evidence that disprove your evidence. So you’re claim of «Evidence» doesn’t mean much"  what evidence have you gave me to prove the sources and writers of the articles I presented were not credible sources? none.  And I did give you evidence on why your sources were wrong, you just didn't read them, and that would explain,"Why would i bother re-reading links i have already read when all this nonsense started."  You can't just ignore the other side of the argument, that would be ignorant. "Also Doctors and Therapist have treating people as there job they get paid for it. So it isn’t in anyway comparable but lets ignore that right?"  Do you think just because they get money, they are greedy and don't care about their clients and patients?  Why do you think good doctors and therapists spend years studying in school to get a job? because they are passionate about  it. So yes it is comparable.  It really looks like all you see is negativity.  Just because you can't see the positivity in things, doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>No it’s not, Yes they studied because they wanted that responsibility.   I on the other hand have not and i will not apologize for living my life how i want to.    Especially considering these draconian measures do not even work which is why the goalpost is moving consistently.    No you haven’t proven them wrong you have given me your opinion that there wrong.  Those are two drastically different things. </p>
<p>Also it’s not ignoring the other side when i have looked at both sides.  And if i can see that the emperical evidence supports one side more then other in my own country.   I know that you will find a way to twist this aswell </p>

        <p>"No it’s not, Yes they studied because they wanted that responsibility. I on the other hand have not and i will not apologize for living my life how i want to."  So you won't apologize for putting other people in danger? " Especially considering these draconian measures do not even work which is why the goalpost is moving consistently."  Again, you have no evidence to support that, and the evidence you gave isn't valid and I gave you evidence why it is not valid, here it is AGAIN, and this time read it, because if you don't you are being ignorant: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/logical-take/202007/yes-masks-work-debunking-the-pseudoscience So don't try to tell me I didn't give you evidence, because you haven't gave me any evidence proving the sources and evidence of these articles are wrong.  Because to you it makes total sense to listen to a claim with no valid evidence supporting it, and its been proven by many studies to be wrong, than to listen to a person who has studied these things for years and know what they are talking about and are actually passionate about what they do.  It is clear to me that everything you learned in school has taught you nothing at all.(That's if you even went to school at all)  "Also it’s not ignoring the other side when i have looked at both sides. And if i can see that the emperical evidence supports one side more then other in my own country. I know that you will find a way to twist this aswell".  Not listening to someone isn't ignorant to you? And that empirical evidence has proven you wrong. (Just look at florida and how many antimaskers are there)  And I didn't twist anything you said at all, you are only saying that because you can't accept you are wrong, I quoted everything you said so don't even try.  "Ignoring it doesn’t make it go away." Then why don't you wear a mask?
"But do you know what might actually help those things get better opening up countries, the economy and worldwide travel."  You care more about a temporarily closed business and not being able to visit other countries rather than people who are sick and need medical attention?  How about you say that face to face to the family members of the people who have died. "No you haven’t proven them wrong you have given me your opinion that there wrong. Those are two drastically different things."  Yeah they ARE drastically different things.  I'm going to post ALL of my sources again to show you I have not given opinion, I have gave you credible sources, just read them. But you know who has given opinion? You have.(You can check the writers and sources of the articles on the page, just so you know it is not fake) https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent -  https://www.ucsf.edu/bio/nina-bai -  https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/covid-19/wildfire_smoke_covid-19.html and https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-mask/art-20485449 also https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/covid-19-mayo-clinic-expert-answers-questions-about-masks-after-cdc-updates-its-recommendation/ - :https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/logical-take/202007/yes-masks-work-debunking-the-pseudoscience - : https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/blog/how-covid-19-is-different-and-worse-than-the-flu#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20COVID%2D,H1N1%20swine%20flu%20strain I hope you learn to wear a mask, and realize that they do work.

        <p>Jesus you seriously think Psychology helps your case.  Yeah i guess lets just ignore the CDC and Stanford for Psychology today that makes alot of sense🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️  </p>
<p>Also Yes i’m not denying that the CDC do support masks, you see the difference is between me and you is that i also interpret there numbers, asses the risks and came too my own  conclusion that the mask Wearing isn’t worth it.  Hard concept to grasp for you i know.  </p>
<p>It started with Flatten the Curve, Then it was talk of a mandatory vaccine, now there is more push for people getting tested.  The goalpost has moved alot in these 6-7 months, if you haven’t noticed you cannot have paid much attention.</p>

        <p>"Jesus you seriously think Psychology helps your case. Yeah i guess lets just ignore the CDC and Stanford for Psychology today that makes alot of sense🤣🤣🤦🏻‍♂️"What Psychology are you talking about?  What I gave didn't include phsycology, The page was just called phsycology today. You cleary don't know what you are talking about.  "  Yeah i guess lets just ignore the CDC and Stanford"  Are you not the one that doesn't wear masks and listen to the CDC?  And my other sources did include the CDC and they support masks.  "you see the difference is between me and you is that i also interpret there numbers, asses the risks and came too the conclusion that the mask Wearing isn’t worth it."  You clearly have the same intelligence as the doctors and people who have studied these thing for years and wrote these articles.  And you OBVIOUSLY have a lab and tested these masks and their materials to see how they work to prevent Covid-19.  And who could forget that you ABSOLUTELY did have your studies peer reviewed and published. "It started with Flatten the Curve, Then it was talk of a mandatory vaccine, now there is more push for people getting tested. The goalpost has moved alot in these 6-7 months,"  It's called taking steps and advancing to have the right mindset and handling the situation appropriately, if you didn't know.  So next time I suggest you double read your comments before posting them.</p>

        <p>Dude there are doctors on both of our sides.  So stop appealing to authority.  Because the truth is you have none</p>
<p>Yeah no if it was handled correctly then all nations would have followed the Swedish model, they already have herd immunity.   So no censoring doctors etc that advocate for the Swedish model isn’t the right approach.   Limiting exposure of discourse is how we don’t learn anything other then what we’re told is correct.  That might be fine for you but it will never be Okey for me.   I am free to draw my own conclusions and i will continue you to do so.  The numbers are on my side even if you refuse to believe them.   So Yeah i’ll not wear a mask since the numbers makes that the reasonable position to hold.  But please go on and cry more wolf about the fucking maskes, you just sound like a broken record at this point</p>

        <p>But that doctor was proven wrong with evidence and you could check the other links, what don't you get about it? And no one has proven the sources and writers of the articles wrong.  And are you just going to ignore that I proved you wrong on your comment? You are not on the levels of these actual doctors so you can't say you have come up with a conclusion, because you haven't provided any evidence you made yourself.</p>

        <p>Yeah a psychology news article, and two-three articles arguing in favor of Masks doesn’t stack up too numbers and analytical data, so Well if your gonna «prove me wrong» How about actually responding to my argument.  And those numbers prove it isn’t nearly as deadily as you seem to believe.    Like it ain’t rocket science so i am amazed by how much you struggle to grasp this.   And again you are appealing to authority, you refuse to ackowledge the data from any of the other links i sent you.  Your only argument is the damn masks which is shows a lack of understanding both on the topic at hand and the nature of the discussion on your side,  so you shouldn’t really try to play up some mental superiority angle</p>

        <p>"Yeah a psychology news article, and two-three articles arguing in favor of Masks doesn’t stack up too numbers and analytical data"  that is not true it had claims with evidence, not psychology.   And those articles have actual sources and have actual studies. "Your only argument is the damn masks which is shows a lack of understanding both on the topic at hand and the nature of the discussion on your side, so you shouldn’t really try to play up some mental superiority angle"  Then what do you think we are arguing about, we are arguing about masks and how they do work.  And Sweden is not doing so well, and no herd immunity isn't a good idea for covid-19:https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/herd-immunity-and-coronavirus/art-20486808 and :https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/87812 and https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/sweden-keeps-ban-large-gatherings-covid-19-cases-rise  and Taiwan :https://www.statnews.com/2020/06/30/taiwan-lessons-fighting-covid-19-using-electronic-health-records/  So don't try to use that as an argument. (and again, you could always check their sources) "And those numbers prove it isn’t nearly as deadily as you seem to believe."  So the 990,000 people dead is nothing? "you refuse to ackowledge the data from any of the other links i sent you." Those were proven wrong with my sources and evidence presented,  and you still have not proven the sources of the articles I presented wrong. And I wouldn't trust people with no info and who has also written this:https://www.activistpost.com/2020/09/leaked-memos-telecom-employees-want-to-stop-5g-deployment-based-on-health-and-economic-concerns.html  and your other article also states:
"This article is a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed [what does this mean?]. It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice."  And the people who wrote them are not credible.  So you were wrong, twice.</p>
