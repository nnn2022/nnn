    <strong>My friend went for a physical for a new job. He has been unemployed for nearly a year due to the wuflu. He has 3 kids. Excited to say the least. He has had 2 jabs. Some alarming news-</strong>
    <p><p>His blood pressure is 205/130. He told me this morning. He is 45, doesn't smoke anything, pretty good shape. He lives a reasonably healthy lifestyle. Jab related? </p>
<p>I have a familial history of heart ailments, so I take BP and cholesterol meds daily. I exercise daily. My BP has never been that high. I have not been jabbed. Am I reading too much into this?</p></p>

        <p>Even if that's not foolproof evidence, combined with all the other reports I think it's safe to say that it's jab related...</p>
<p>Sad to say but you might have to start looking for a new friend soon... That's insane BP.</p>

        <p>I know. I checked into those numbers and they are in the emergency range. I was hoping for a bona fide medical professional to see this. Like I said, I am familiar with meds for controlling BP, and mine has never been that high. BTW, I used to smoke too. But quit 11 years ago. Lungs checked annually.</p>

        <p>My auntie had 245 over 225.</p>
<p>I didn't even know it was possible to have a reading that high. It was over a month ago and she is still alive and her blood pressure is down, but still not back to normal.</p>
<p>When she went to the hospital after two weeks of severe head pains with her heart pounding and high BP, the doctor told her it was anxiety.</p>
<p>I'm not a doctor but I'm pretty sure anxiety cannot cause that sort of BP.</p>

        <p>Maybe, maybe not. There's also "white coat syndrome" like your BP goes up when you're at the doctor because you're a bit stressed, and the real baseline BP is lower. He needs to monitor it himself and see if it's really that bad or if maybe his baseline is only a little elevated.</p>
<p>Your BP may be lower because you're on meds for it. IDK, I've never tried to lower mine; I have the opposite problem. I sit at about 100/70 <em>after</em> drinking coffee. Used to be 80/55 but eating more salt and gaining a little weight fixed that.</p>

        <p>I drink STRONG black coffee with a bit of sugar and my BP is 128-132/82-90 after I drink 3 big cups. I can ride the recumbent bike and work out hard, or get off the treadmill sweating and I get 120/82. So the meds are very good. I am worried because he is a real good guy.

        <p>That's insanely high. Is he sure about those numbers? What did his doctor say? I can't imagine he wasn't prescribed something. When's the last time he had been to the doctor? I presume it wasn't that high before?</p>

        <p>The conversation we had over coffee today was not our usual BS session. I have my meds sitting on my watercooler, and I also told him to go see my doctor. He accepts patients and he takes good care of me. But like most men, he doesn't get annual physicals so he doesn't have a baseline to go off of. Where I have been going for 16 years now, any changes can be monitored. Men, FFS, go to the fvcking doctor. Take care of yourselves.</p>

        <p>A friend of mine nearly stroked out in the dental chair. His BP was up around 200. He went to the hospital it’s cost him over 10k so far for the tests and the night in the hospital. He’s been double jabbed. He’s on BP medication but it’s been well controlled.</p>

        <p>Since no long term data is out we can only speculate. I wouldn’t be surprised if it was connected as it’s causing heart issues. I know you are probably not looking for treatment advice for your friend but I will throw this out there as it may help…tell him start a regiment of Vitamin D (10,000 IU) and Chelated Magnesium (100mcg) taken together 1x a day (before bed). My husband has had high BP as his is linked to genetics and I started him on this regimen. After 2 months he is within normal BP range for his age so he does not need to go on BP Meds. His doctor was quite surprised. I told his doc that I started researching other countries and found out the US takes more BP meds than any other country in the world. I started looking into what they do that we don’t. It seems like the Daily recommended dosage for Vitamin D and Magnesium in the US is way lower than what it should be. I have been doing the same regime as mine was borderline high and now my BP is perfect. At this point it couldn’t hurt for your friend to give this a try. I’d also say an aspirin daily to thin his blood to avoid blood clots is probably a good idea. I hope everything turns out ok for him.</p>

<p>She still has higher readings that before the second astrazeneca jab but I don't feel like she could die any minute anymore. She monitors her BP every day now. </p>
