    <strong>Nurse says: "I've had two jabs of the vaccine but I'm not going to hug yet"</strong>
    <p><p>Article is in Dutch <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5216196/zorgpersoneel-vaccinatie-tweede-prik-pfizer">here</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Rough translation / Summary</p>
<p>This article is about a 35 year old senior-nurse, working on a covid ward, and about a young female  lung-doctor. </p>
<p>Both of them basically say that they have had both Pfizer Jabs but they're still being careful as ever.</p>
<p>They're not going to hug anyone, wear the same amount of protection, distance, don't go out except for work, can't go into stores without masks, just éverything is the same. </p>
<p>And these are medical people, should they not have a bit more faith in their magical vaccination? If even théy don't trust the vaccine to protect them, why should anyone else trust the vaccine to protect them? One of them is a lung doctor for crying out loud. Both of these are young women and i think we can safely assume they are not otherwise in a risk-group. And if we can't rely on this vaccine to protect us (not that i need protection from a low-risk virus), then why should I take the gamble?    </p>
<p>There's even an inset of text halfway down the article by the Director of the RIVM ( National Institute for Citizen-health and the Environment, It's basically the Dutch CDC) that literally says "Can you do more if you are vaccinated? No, sadly not. Even if you have had both jabs you cannot hug people without worries. The measures will stay in effect because we do not know if people can infect others afterwards. "</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So to put all of this together: not even medically trained people feel like the vaccine protect them, They dont even know if it protect other people fróm you, since you could still spread it possibly. So it doesnt protect you yourself, it doesn't protect others fróm you (which is the claim they make about masks, that it protects others from you).  You also get no part of your normal life back when you get vaccinated. Add that to the general concerns about safety, after effects etc. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Why should I? what benefit is there to this vaccine, for me but also for others, if even medically trained people dont trust it and the makers of these vaccines dont have enough faith in their product to make us any promises. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Why should I?</p></p>
