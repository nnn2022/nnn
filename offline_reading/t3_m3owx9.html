        <p>Owning a business is not work. Managing a business, yes. Managers should get paid for their mental labor. And yes a lot of business owners do put in some mental or physical labor to maintain the business. They should get paid for such labor.</p>

        <p>&rt;You apparently have never owned a business. Most business owners work more than thier employees. 80 plus hours a week and sometimes they don't get paid. </p>
<p>As I said, people should get paid for the work they put in including business owners. It seems like you are talking about small business owners. I don't have a problem with small businesses, as you say they often are struggling themselves.</p>
<p>But, large companies. Does Bezos work 80 hours a week? Does he really produce thousands of times more value than his employees?</p>
<p>&rt;What you want is equity. Equal effort and equal pay for all jobs...thats insane.</p>
<p>No, that's not what equity is. Equity is getting paid for the value you produce. If you produce more value, you can make more money. Notably, owning a machine does not produce value. Building the machine produces value, operating the machine produces value</p>
<p>&rt;Why would anyone bother to become a doctor</p>
<p>In Cuba, doctors don't get paid exorbitant amounts of money. People become doctors because they want to help people get healthy. Doctors can afford to live off modest amounts of money because their medical school doesn't require them to go into debt. Or pay at all</p>
<p>&rt; create a business when it pays the same to sit at home and do nothing. </p>
<p>I never said that sitting at home and doing nothing should earn you anything</p>

        <p>&rt;Large corporations are a small part of the economy, most of our economy is small businesses.</p>
<p>50% of GDP is small business, but 80% of wealth is owned by 20% of the population. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/06/25/six-facts-about-wealth-in-the-united-states/amp/</p>
<p>Small business often aren't owned outright. They may pay rent for their buildings or have business debt that they need to make payments on. Who owns most of that debt? The top 20%</p>
<p>&rt;Again why do you care what others have? Because you are jealous of what they have.</p>
<p>Because people are dying who can't afford food, medicine, and housing. Billionaires hoarding wealth while people die of poverty is despicable</p>
<p>&rt;Owning a machine and using it produces value. you analogy is flawed as fuck. </p>
<p>If a machine existed, and was not owned by someone, but was still maintained and operated, it would still produce value. <em>The ownership of the machine does not produce value</em>.</p>
<p>The only justification for private ownership of machines leading to increased value is if private ownership of machines leads to more of them existing. Since worker-owned business would still need those machines, I don't think that argument makes sense</p>

        <p>Yes half the economy is small businesses. Think about that for a second commie. That means half the country figured out how to make a profit and a living for themselves without trying to steal it from others like socialists do.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with renting a build, or tools or even labor (as that is what employment is, renting labor)...</p>
<p>Ok let me break this down to such a point even a moron can understand. There is such a thing as private property...the owner of the machine gets to determine how and if it is used. Not you, not government, not your little pinko friends...just the owner of the machine. If decides to leave it dormant, that's on him and that is his choice. Tou can make your own thing but you do not have the right to 1) take it from others 2) demand private property to be used for your wants or desires 3) determine how and when it is used. </p>
<p>If an owner of a machine decides to use said machine to make money for himself and a few employees...thats great....if he decides to burn it to the ground, that's his choice as the owner.</p>

<p>No, no, no. You've gotten it mixed up. 50% of GDP comes from small businesses. That doesn't mean 50% of people are business owners. Surely you see how that's an absurd jump</p>
<p>&rt;Nothing wrong with renting a build, or tools</p>
<p>Economists study rent, you know. Rent doesn't produce value in an economy. Rent is viewed as a negative because it incentivizes laziness. Rent is money given to someone without them expending any effort at all, simply because they own something</p>
<p>&rt;Ok let me break this down to such a point even a moron can understand. There is such a thing as private property...the owner of the machine gets to determine how and if it is used. </p>
<p>Under capitalism, yes. Those are the rules. But do those rules lead to better lives? You must concede that owning a machine does not produce value because you did not refute that claim </p>
<p>&rt;If an owner of a machine decides to use said machine to make money for himself and a few employees...thats great....if he decides to burn it to the ground, that's his choice as the owner.</p>
<p>Surely you see why destroying a useful machine would be negative. You're not exactly making a good argument for private ownership of capital goods</p>

<p>A Marxist economist? Because yes rent does create value in the economy...for one it's a landlords salary which he spends...he also uses it to pay property taxes. Rent is also used to buy supplies to fix said home or building. This statement was just dumb.</p>
<p>Of course I see why it would be negative but again that's not your call as its private property and it isn't your property so at the end of the day you can mind your fucking business.</p>

&rt;
&rt;A Marxist economist? </p>
<p>Nope. It's a well established concept</p>
<p>https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;Rent seeking is an economic concept that occurs when an entity seeks to gain wealth without any reciprocal contribution of productivity.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;the economic definition of “rent,” which is defined as economic wealth obtained through shrewd or potentially manipulative use of resources</p>
<p>&rt;Because yes rent does create value in the economy...for one it's a landlords salary which he spends...</p>
<p>If the landlord did not take a salary, the tenant would be able to spend that money. It is no better for the economy for the landlord to spend money than the tenant</p>
<p>&rt;he also uses it to pay property taxes.</p>
<p>This would also happen if the landlord was out of the picture</p>
<p>&rt; Rent is also used to buy supplies to fix said home or building. This statement was just dumb.</p>
<p>This is the only portion of the money that creates value. Fixing a broken building creates value. Owning a building that already exists and preventing people from living there unless they pay does not create value</p>
<p>&rt;Of course I see why it would be negative but again that's not your call as its private property and it isn't your property so at the end of the day you can mind your fucking business.</p>
<p>Dude calm down. Are you defending this hypothetical person who apparently wants to destroy a working machine that is creating value and is a source of income for the people who work it?</p>

        <p>Sure but that's not for you to determine. The money is his to do whatever he wants. Besides inherited wealth isn't as big of a problem as the propaganda tells you. It's been proven that only 21% of all millionaires in the US get any kind of inheritance. Of that 21% only 16% receive an amount more than 100k. Only 3% of those receive an inheritance of 1 million. Most millionaires are self made. 88% of American millionaires are self made, worldwide that number is 68%. Guess that blows that belief, as mistaken as it is, out of the water. </p>

<p>Millionaires aren't a problem. A working class person can conceivably save up a million dollars in their lifetime. Billionaires are a problem. How can someone make a billion dollars from their own labor? They can't. Billionaires become billionaires because they lay claim to profits generated by actual workers</p>

<p>Dude honestly your entire ideology is built on petty jealousy. And no one is exploiting workers....thats marxist propaganda. You know what the true value of labor is? Zero dollars. The value of your labor is only what someone is willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>Also have you ever read a socialist book or are you just regurgitating what you read on reddit?</p>
<p>Some criticisms of labour value of labor:</p>
<p>From Carl Menger: </p>
<p>"There is no necessary and direct connection between the value of a good and whether, or in what quantities, labor and other goods of higher order were applied to its production. A non-economic good (a quantity of timber in a virgin forest, for example) does not attain value for men since large quantities of labor or other economic goods were not applied to its production. Whether a diamond was found accidentally or was obtained from a diamond pit with the employment of a thousand days of labor is completely irrelevant for its value. In general, no one in practical life asks for the history of the origin of a good in estimating its value, but considers solely the services that the good will render him and which he would have to forgo if he did not have it at his command...The quantities of labor or of other means of production applied to its production cannot, therefore, be the determining factor in the value of a good. Comparison of the value of a good with the value of the means of production employed in its production does, of course, show whether and to what extent its production, an act of past human activity, was appropriate or economic. But the quantities of goods employed in the production of a good have neither a necessary nor a directly determining influence on its value."</p>

        <p>&rt;Going with the bernie sanders line now? It's was millionaires and billionaires but as soon as he became a millionaire, he no longer says they are bad. Billionaires aren't the problem. Nearly 55% of billionaires are self made...meaning they worked for it. </p>
<p>Under capitalist views, "self made" includes "owned something that went up in value". No one can become a billionaire without hiring people to work below them or having money invested in the right business</p>

&rt;You know what the true value of labor is? Zero dollars. The value of your labor is only what someone is willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>I don't believe that 1 hour of labor equals 1 unit of value, so I agree with the criticism you list.</p>

        <p>I highly doubt that. Its sad that you think socialism is an actually works, after two centuries of failure. Socialism is akin to slavery...its economic authoritarianism. Its an ideology for those that want to put all of there responsibilities onto the collective. </p>
<p>Winston Churchill said it best: “Socialism is the philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance, and the gospel of envy.” —Perth, Scotland, 28 May 1948, in Churchill, Europe Unite: Speeches 1947 &amp; 1948 (London: Cassell, 1950), 347.</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>“The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings. The inherent virtue of Socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.” —House of Commons, 22 October 1945.</p>
<p>Margret Thather had a pretty good quote too. “The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.”</p>
<p>Some reasons why your ideology fails: 
1) Socialism ignores incentives. In a capitalist economy, incentives are very importance. Market prices, the profit-and-loss system of accounting, and private property rights provide an efficient, interrelated system of incentives to guide and direct economic behavior. Capitalism is based on the theory that incentives matter.</p>
<p>Under socialism, incentives either play a minimal role or are ignored completely. A centrally planned economy without market prices or profits, where property is owned by the state, is a system without an effective incentive mechanism to direct economic activity. By failing to emphasize incentives, socialism is a theory inconsistent with human nature and is therefore doomed to fail. Socialism is based on the theory that incentives don’t matter.</p>
<p>2) The its wasn't real socialism gaslighting. Marxists admit that many “socialist” countries around the world were failing (they usually blame the capitalists or the CIA). According to the modern socialist the reason for failure is not that socialism is deficient, but that the socialist economies are not practicing “pure” socialism. The perfect version of socialism would work; it is just the imperfect socialism that doesn’t work. Marxists like to compare a theoretically perfect version of socialism with practical, imperfect capitalism which allows them to claim that socialism is superior to capitalism. Its not and never will be. </p>
<p>3) Profits and Losses. By rewarding success and penalizing failure, the profit system provides a strong disciplinary mechanism which continually redirects resources away from weak, failing, and inefficient firms toward those firms which are the most efficient and successful at serving the public. A competitive profit system ensures a constant re-optimization of resources and moves the economy toward greater levels of efficiency. Unsuccessful firms cannot escape the strong discipline of the marketplace under a profit/loss system. Competition forces companies to serve the public interest or suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Under central planning, there is no profit-and-loss system of accounting to accurately measure the success or failure of various programs. Without profits, there is no way to discipline firms that fail to serve the public interest and no way to reward firms that do. There is no efficient way to determine which programs should be expanded and which ones should be contracted or terminated.</p>
<p>Without competition, centrally planned economies do not have an effective incentive structure to coordinate economic activity. Without incentives, the results are a spiraling cycle of poverty and misery. Instead of continually reallocating resources towards greater efficiency, socialism falls into a vortex of inefficiency and failure.</p>
<p>many many more but ill stop here.</p>

<p>Democratic socialism does not require authoritarianism</p>
<p>&rt;1) Socialism ignores incentives. In a capitalist economy, incentives are very importance.

&rt;
&rt;Under socialism, incentives either play a minimal role or are ignored completely.</p>
<p>Under socialism, every worker benefits when the businesses profits. Every worker suffers when the business loses money. There are plenty of incentives</p>
<p>&rt;A centrally planned economy without market prices or profits, </p>
<p>Socialism is not a central planned economy</p>
<p>&rt;3) Profits and Losses. By rewarding success and penalizing failure, the profit system provides a strong disciplinary mechanism which continually redirects resources away from weak, failing, and inefficient firms toward those firms which are the most efficient and successful at serving the public. </p>
<p>Market socialism is a thing. All workers of a business share in the profit or loss. </p>
<p>Honestly, even under capitalism workers are punished when their employer fails. When a company doesn't profit, they lay off employees. Under capitalism, everyone loses in bad times but the elites win in the good times. Capitalism ends in a net transfer of wealth into the hands of the very few</p>
<p>&rt;Under central planning,</p>
<p>Socialism does not mean central planning. Democratic socialism, where the workers of a business democratically make decisions, is very different from your authoritarian idea of central control.</p>

        <p>Sigh...this statement was just moronic. Democratic socialism is just socialism with a new coat of paint. Nothing different, nothing new...just an added adjective to con the gullible and mental deficient.</p>
<p>Your every worker benefits line didn't refute anything I said. You are spewing talking points you barely understand. Have you ever read a book on socialism? Like an actual book and not just what reddit commies tell you socialism is?</p>
<p>Market socialism doesn't work because socialism is a command economy...what do you think the dictatorship of the proletariat is? An authoritarian state that plans the economy. The definition of socialism is 
a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole. Notice it says production, distribution and exchange....thats control of an entire economy....aka a command economy.</p>
<p>Employees are punished when an employer goes out of business. They lose thier jobs because the employer no longer exists...this doesn't change under socialism. Socialism transfers the wealth to the Uber elite...why do you think every major corporation in America is supporting leftist/socialist causes? Because it puts them in power.</p>

        <p>Yes I have read them all, I'm am ex Marxist-leninist after all. How I know you haven't. Now answer the question.</p>
<p>Actually BLM said they want to destroy the nuclear family within the black community. Destruction of the nuclear family is in chapter 2 of the communist manifesto. Do you even know what the nuclear family is because it doesn't seem like you do...let me break this down so even someone as mentally lacking as you can understand.</p>
<p>The definition of the nuclear family is: a couple and their dependent children, regarded as a basic social unit.</p>
<p>So basically mom, dad ans the kids. Having your family watch the kids while you go out or work doesn't destroy the nuclear family...that has to be the dumbest statement you have made so far.</p>
<p>The below link is an archived copy of the BLM mission statement...they have since removed it from the site after they got blasted for the nuclear family line and thier ties to marxism...the family comment is third from the bottom.
https://web.archive.org/web/20200408020723/https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/</p>
<p>And now marx on the abolition of the family; </p>
<p>Abolition [Aufhebung] of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the Communists.
On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form, this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians, and in public prostitution.
The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.</p>

<p>Yeah I haven't. Reading theory isn't necessary for criticism of the status quo, however. No political movement can work if every one of its supporters are required to read theory</p>
<p>&rt;Actually BLM said they want to destroy the nuclear family within the black community. </p>
<p>That's not what they said, actually, if you read the quote from their website</p>
<p>&rt;So basically mom, dad ans the kids. Having your family watch the kids while you go out or work doesn't destroy the nuclear family...</p>
<p>That's my point. Neither do the suggestions made on the BLM website</p>

&rt;https://web.archive.org/web/20200408020723/https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and “villages” that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.</p>
<p>Oh no. Caring for each other to the degree that mother, parent, and child are comfortable. The fucking horror</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I am not advocating for Marx's ideas so his quote is not completely relevant to this discussion. It is interesting, though, and I'd want to learn more.</p>

        <p>You haven't read any of the theory but simp for the ideology. You ever think the people teaching you this crap might be lying to you? Or maybe even using you? Not to be mean but the soviets called people like you useful idiots.</p>
<p>And yes that exactly what they said...they want to disrupt the nuclear family...period. </p>
<p>Actually you are advocating for marx as most of today's socialism is based on marx. I already gave you a list of authors to learn more...if you want I can give you a few book critiquing socialism/communism as well.</p>

<p>Disrupt is different from destroy. Uber disrupted the transportation industry. It didn't fucking destroy it. Not that I think Uber is a good company, but is a useful example.</p>
<p>I don't see what is bad with using a village to raise a child, while having the parents' and child's consent. It seems like you're worried about babies being taken away from their parents, or something to that effect. Which I would be against, for the record.</p>

        <p>I've not only read the theories for capitalism and socialism but I'm a participant in a capitalist society. Im currently reading human action by Ludwig Von Mises. Like I said earlier...the problem with socialists is they compare the utopian version of thier ideology to the real world version of capitalism...never do they compare it to real world examples of socialism or utopian versions of capitalism.</p>
<p>And honestly you can't say you know anything about socialism when you have never studied it. Reddit is not a good source for information on socialism...there is alot of misinformation here...like I've seen alot of people say socialism is charity or helping the poor. It's not and never will be. Go to the source and read these things for yourself...until then you are just a useful idiot for those looking to manipulate you.</p>
<p>No one is using me. Capitalism allows for the free of economic choice. Socialism doesn't.</p>
<p>Actually Uber and lyft have practically destroyed the taxi business in rural America so that was a terrible analogy.</p>
<p>I gave you one same snippet of information on socialism and the destruction of the nuclear family. The second chapter of marxs book is 2 pages long.</p>

Yeah cause our tax going towards healthcare, education and housing is sooooo regressive. I wish all my tax money just went to daddy musk and the rest of the billionaires. You are right though that the poor and middle class pay the majority though, that shit needs to be sorted out on a worldwide scale.

        <p>These are the same people who think needing to work in order to support yourself is a capitalist conspiracy instead of the way things have been since the dawn of time. It wasn’t too long ago (stretching back since before the agricultural revolution) that the majority of people did back-breaking labor from dawn till dusk every single day of their lives (which would be far shorter than ours due to all the incurable and infectious diseases and famines and whatnot), and having all your children survive to adulthood and your wife never dying during childbirth was rare.</p>

        <p>This is why lockdown works now but wouldn't have worked previously. We have the technology for spoiled people to sit at home. They love it. There is no commute, which means no traffic or gas costs. No need to spend time pretending to care about their appearance either. They also probably work less. Instead of dealing with an office environment, they can have Netflix or a podcast on while they work. They do not care about the people who can't do this, and won't until it impacts them, which it inevitably will, though they're too dumb to realize this. There are a lot of such people. I could be like them, but I realize not everything is about me and not everything is about short-term benefits.</p>

<p>I've actually heard a lot of people that I know who can work from home talking about how they are lucky to be able to work from home. Saying how they feel for healthcare workers, restaraunt employees, grocery store workers, laborers, etc. And want to do what they can to keep such people safe by limiting the spread of the pandemic</p>
<p>&rt;There is no commute, which means no traffic or gas costs. No need to spend time pretending to care about their appearance either.</p>
<p>I really don't see any of these as negatives. If you can get your work done without wasting gas, why not?</p>

<p>I don't see a point. I didn't skip a day of work during this "pandemic" and I work much more efficiently from home.</p>
<p>People from service industry losing their jobs is not my problem (and they likely won't, people still go out working from home or not - assuming there is no lockdown - if anything, it's an opportunity for local businesses), just like caring about others health by wearing a mask is not my problem.</p>

<p>I agree about the first part. We should have locked down much harder from the beginning. But, I imagine this subreddit would go bonkers if anyone proposed something like that...</p>

<p>There are many jobs where going to the office is less productive than working from home, at least for some people. I don't see how expressing that desire will harm anyone</p>

        <p>As OP said, the problem isn't working from home or wanting to work less, the problem is in doing those they way they've chosen (lockdowns/restrictions), they're directly effecting everybody else in society that either 1. can't survive doing things this way, or 2. don't want to for their own sanity's sake. If they actually cared they'd let people go back to normal life. But instead they call those people selfish while they get paid to sit in their house.</p>
<p>Some of these jobs are frankly more efficiently done at home. If that is so - great, they can stay working from home. But you don't need to inadvertently control everybody else in order to do that. You just do it.</p>
