        <p>No one is thinking enough of the children and young adults, I agree.  </p>
<p>I remember my grandmother coming to visit when I was young and saying things like "little pictures don't talk.".  Or maybe "pretty pictures don't talk".   Anyways, children from her age were meant to be seen and not heard.  Seems irrelevant, but I will continue.</p>
<p>So as I grew up in my home (they didn't live near us so this is carryover from that generation through my parents) I continued to excel and try to make them proud , but I wasn't ever acknowledged as being more ready or responsible or get this - even treated older.  Even as a teen, and eventually an adult.</p>
<p>That carried on forever.  I eventually cut contact.</p>
<p>Anyways, so from the older generations kids what I guess you guys call boomers, you have a variety of kids who were raised in that era and some continuing on behaviors or beliefs from it.  </p>
<p>The kids weren't considered enough, and the adults failed to recognize them once they too became grown.  And wanted to hold onto the throne until they died so to speak.  </p>
<p>A lot of freedoms are being taken away because "we still have time left".  </p>
<p>Not if they take it.</p>

        <p>I understand that point but as with everything there’s more to explore. In other words we can’t continue to blame a generation for this, another for that. </p>
<p>When my parents were growing up they were hit over the head daily with “go to college get a degree and you will make $x more over your lifetime. This was a function of the previous generation wanted better for them. My mother went to school and taught, my father kept his family roofing business going. He went to a military college, but he dropped out after 2 years because he’d be sneaking off to help his dad roof. Anyways they both carried over that lesson “go to college get an education”. 
In the early 90s (I think) is when government subsidies were kicking into high gear. Parents......having each to work two jobs to make ends meet for the first time ever, didnt have time or the resources to research something like that. And can u blame them? Raising to kids that played 5 sports each. Hockey practice 6am then off to work. </p>
<p>Time flies and all the sudden it’s college search time and they’ve had this idea instilled as fact for 50 years. If it were me I certainly could understand assuming jobs out of college paid well and were a lock. My older brother went to a private school. I would be listening to them talk about tuition. This at least opened my eyes at least enough to go to a state school. Then the financial crisis hit. Even trades were tough, but on the other side of the 08 collapse, it turns out those not in debt and learning a trade/in a trade already were debt free and making good money. Anyways the point is I think most people want the best for their kids. And things changed without them being aware which is completely understandable. </p>
<p>Final point, learning a trade acquiring licenses making urself unique in that way is a very fulfilling thing to do. If you want to go to school and be driven with a financial plan that’s fine to. But unless YOU are going to take school serious and treat it as a job almost, the costs imo usually don’t outweigh benefits. Admittedly i never was intended for college and went anyway so I’m bias towards trades which I’m in now. Not being in debt 30-200k is a HUGE deal no one seems to address enough</p>

        <p>I mentioned this on another post but it's relevant.</p>
<p>I've done two years of in-person college. I finished with a 4.0.</p>
<p>I've done two semesters online now. Every exam is riddled with errors and typos that result in correct answers being marked wrong. My professor has ignored all of my emails regarding this, so myself and my classmates have no choice but to accept that we will look stupid on paper by the end of this, or give up our current degree progress, tuition and scholarships.</p>
