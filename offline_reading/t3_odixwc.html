    <strong>The real conspiracy theorists believe DeSantis is hiding bodies in the Everglades, that everyone against this "vaccine" is anti-vax because of 5G and microchips, that the virus came from bat-soup in a Wuhan wet-market, and that the government and Big Pharma care about them and their Grans.</strong>
    <p><p>Also all the reports of bad side effects and deaths from the jab made to VAERS, the CovidVaccinated subreddit and social media in general are fake and part of an anti-vaxxer agenda (I'd love to hear what that agenda is some day but as of yet I haven't had it explained to me). Hell, some of them even believe literally no one has died from this (or that the deaths are single digits). </p>
<p>At this point it is a conspiracy theory to say Tiffany Dover is alive and well when all evidence points to the contrary. These dip-shit doomers are in deep, deep, DEEP denial. The sunk cost fallacy is strong with them. These people believe wholeheartedly that the flu just up and disappeared because everyone wore masks and socially distanced... yet Covid spread so much because no one wore masks or socially distanced. Wrap your head around that one.</p>
<p>The media is always lying and is not to be trusted APART from when it comes to Covid. The government is corrupt and is not to be trusted APART from when it comes to Covid. Big Pharma is greedy and is not to be trusted APART from when it comes to Covid. You have the freedom to speak your mind and decide what is done with your body APART from when it comes to Covid.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of just how far gone our opposition is: one of the top moderators from multiple anti-NNN subs personally messaged me saying he believed the survival rate of Covid is EIGHTY PERCENT. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o90oii/one_of_the_mods_of_a_antinnn_sub_personally/">Here it is if you don't believe me.</a> They associate freedom with fascism. To put it bluntly: they are fucking insane and brainwashed beyond all hope.</p></p>

        <p>They are constantly humiliated and embarrassed by being so gullible, as ive said before like a gambler chasing his losses they dont know when to quit and admit they were wrong</p>
<p>Consequently they will deny whats right in front of their faces, remove anything that reminds them of their foolishness calling it misinformation and even go so far as to use the arguments they were so quick to denounce to prove their point</p>
<p>"just because some died/was violently ill after the vaccine doesnt mean the vaccine caused it"</p>
<p>"its only old people dying of the vaccine , its to be expected" </p>
<p>but everything was due to covid, no mitigations needed, no cause and correlation on this one</p>
<p>they will deny and deny hoping and waiting for vindication of their zealousness</p>

        <p>Sadly a lot of morbidity and mortality is among the healthy young. This group particularly doesn’t need the vacz cuz they have a statistically 0 percent chance of dying from the virus. Asymptomatic spread isn’t a thing .</p>

        <p>What's really scary is how often the politics board on 4chan  /pol/ is correct about these things. I used to just write them off as crazy but after casually just checking them out for the past year the number of times they've said something that was crazy and I thought must be a troll just gets proven true is way too high. At this point I'm now more surprised when they're wrong then when they're right. Besides the obvious crazy shit lol.</p>

        <p>No the microchip/nanobot thing is entirely possible and a big reason for me.</p>
<p>But where they dilute it is its for tracking. No no no, it's for control. They already have tracking done.</p>

        <p>Christ that moderator sounds unhinged! Calling someone mr big unironically? He should go get his head checked while you sew up your mortal wounds lol.</p>
<p>This was such a cathartic rant of yours to read! I’ve actually had to deal with the illogical reasoning behind “flu disappearance” a few times. I’ve mentioned time and time again that it’s not possible, only presentable because health services stopped recording flu altogether late 2019 or was it early 2020? I can’t remember exactly but it still happened right before rona season. All I’ve heard back is disregard of that entirely and that “covid is so virulent it’s killed off all the other respiratory viruses floating around”. I don’t claim to be well versed in medicine but bloody hell! </p>
<p>You hit the nail on the head too with the “but just this once” fixation everyone has. Plenty of people I know who’ve claimed they’re anti-establishment have been some of the most outspoken in their advocacy of “stopping the pandemic no matter the cost”. How does no one comprehend that the old adage applies, give them an inch they’ll take a mile? What’s withdrawn is never deposited back. </p>
<p>5G and microchips ain’t mutually exclusive to the rona. Whichever media source planted that to make us look delusional is barking up the wrong fucking tree. Was pretty funny that not long ago the Pentagon unveiled a new covid tracing microchip implant though lol. </p>
<p>What I’m not looking forward to as any sane person ain’t, is the further enforced chaos and submission that’s likely to occur later this year, early next year. The “just this once” crowd are totally unprepared for the cyber attacks, food shortages and infrastructure going to hell that are lined up waiting for us when we think it’s all over. That is where that tolerance leads us. </p>
<p>Bravo mate and keep doing as you do!</p>

        <p>I agree and I’ll go a step further and tell you what it is. In the new bill that was just passed banning vax passports, it states they are giving the health dept the means to control an outbreak by any means necessary, including forced vaccination and removal from the home. CA passed this as an entire bill and everyone was up and arms but FL hides theirs sandwiched in something that people will praise as a great idea.</p>

        <p>The Florida figures were low despite no masks or social distancing so some of the doomers (spurred on by a journalist who has been deboonked) resorted to screaming about corruption, fiddled figures and, most insane of all, that DeSantis was having bodies of people who had died from the 'rona hidden in the Everglades.</p>

        <p>It's really funny, I hear the "pro-science" people talk about 5G and microchips more often than the so-called "antivaxxers". </p>
<p>Also, do they really believe in a "antivax agenda"? What is that even supposed to be?</p>
