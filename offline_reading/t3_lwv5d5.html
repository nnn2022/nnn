    <strong>Conspiratorial angle of the vax.</strong>
    <p><p>Everyone has thier own take on the vaccine and the motivations behind covid. I think it's safe to say at the VERY least, a pretty basic take could be that there is money to be made in selling a vaccine to every government in the world... That shouldn't even be considered a conspiracy theory... This is where I land personally.</p>
<p>Some of the more paranoid might think that the vaccine is part of a eugenics operation. Sterilize some people, get that birth rate down for the "greater good" of the planet. Im not a huge believer in this, but I think it's enough of a possibility that I'm not taking the vaccine, and neither is my family.</p>
<p>Others on the far end of the spectrum might even believe that the vaccine could be a ticking time bomb of sorts... Give it a few years and people will start dropping dead. I tend to not believe this myself... But again, I can't say that it's a 0% chance.</p>
<p>And now here's the fun one:</p>
<p>What if covid is just a giant smoke screen to vaccinate obedient members of society against the REAL bioweapon that is going to be released later? Anyone who doesn't have the vaccine is gonna drop dead once they kick off the real eugenics operation. An easy way to weed out dissenters.</p>
<p>I don't actually believe that last one, but if that's the case I straight up don't want to live in that world and I feel I made the right choice regardless.</p></p>

        <p>To me the 'soft' conspiracy, the one that isn't actually a conspiracy theory, is governments are doing nothing other than continuing to cover their arses, as clumsily as they've been doing it throughout this, which is why the rhetoric looks odd and contradictory. They want people to continue to follow the rules while they rollout the vaccines, and they become harder to enforce if vaccinated people don't have to, so they make the silly-sounding claim that vaccines might not prevent spread so those vaccinated still have to follow them. Admitting vaccines do prevent spread also begs embarrassing questions about viral load and spread... I don't even expect us to hit the point where those not at higher risk are being seriously pressured to be vaccinated, especially looking longterm, I think vaccine passports/ID are still going to be more trouble than they're worth to get people to accept. I think the vaccine will be as safe as any, and still expect this to be brushed under the rug quietly ASAP.</p>
<p>There's no way obedience Vs. disobedience is some simple genetic binary.</p>

        <p>If itâ€™s the last one then I have no regrets. But I think the other two scenarios are much more likely.</p>

        <p>Wouldnâ€™t we be able to look at the ingredients of the vax and tell that itâ€™s protecting against something like other than covid?</p>

        <p>They have a precedent of doing just that.</p>
<p>https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1345291/world-health-organisation-coronavirus-swine-flu-n1h1-pandemic-covid-review-spt</p>
<p>"When asked about the WHO's handling of the Swine Flu pandemic, Mr Wodarg said: "Glaxo, Novartis, Sanofi, they had all launched new production programs to produce the vaccine for this pandemic."</p>
<p>"They had all made agreements with nation states."</p>
<p>"And since they had invested so much in this but couldn't sell the vaccine because there was no pandemic and no sign of a flu outbreak - they fabricated a pandemic."</p>
<p>And look who's name pops up with wildly inaccurate modeling. </p>
<p>"Early predictions of how Swine Flu would cripple the world raised alarm bells within the scientific community, enabling the WHO to increase preventative measures."</p>
<p>"At the time, Imperial College London's Professor Neil Ferguson and his team created a model in which 65,000 people in the UK were likely to die from N1H1."</p>
<p>"This was a significant benchmark in the WHO's decision to issue a pandemic."</p>

        <p>man, just look at how many people are on this sub and how many are on the coronavirus sub. the sheep outnumber the free spirits. they want to kill as many people as possible, so they go after the most numerous. it's simple. the satanic elites are bound to make you kill yourself, because they are really afraid of the return of karma. thus, despite all their power they cannot harm you, other than by carrying out their brainwashing and their propaganda stuffed with subliminal messages on you.<em>ðŸ“·</em></p>
