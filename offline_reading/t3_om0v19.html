    <strong>A quick summary of the comments on the LA subreddit yesterday: "It's getting harder and harder to prove these 'anti-vaxxers' wrong when they're constantly being proved right!!!"</strong>
    <p><p>It's that or blaming the unvaccinated for the mask mandate (even though they're not testing vaccinated people for Covid in the States now as far as I'm aware so of course the numbers will show only unvaccinated people getting/dying WITH the virus). The brainwashing and lack of critical thinking is astonishing. We are CONSTANTLY ten steps ahead of the narrative and always have been here.</p>
<p>The same idiots that sneered "tHey wOuLD NEVER bRinG iN vACcInE paSsPorTs!" are now the ones clamoring for them and cheering on France for their "brave and bold" decision to force everyone into getting an experimental, rushed jab. Somewhere deep down inside they must feel ashamed, surely? They MUST know they're wrong, right? This is so fucking evil, humiliating and inhumane; if this isn't dystopian then what the fuck is?</p>
<p>Your government lied to you and told you these "vaccines" were your golden ticket to freedom, only to turn around and reinstate a mask mandate. Not to mention you probably felt like dog-shit for days, weeks or even months after your jab. It is okay to be angry, but direct your rage and indignation at the real enemy here. We haven't lied to you, if anything we've been spitting truths this whole time and screaming at you to wake up. We tried to warn you, even when you came at us with insults and threats, but YOU WOULDN'T FUCKING LISTEN.</p>
<p>I have seen far too many videos and posts and heard countless horror stories from people I know in real life to ever even consider getting this fucking jab for a virus I'm not even at fucking risk from! Let's face it, it's not the virus you're afraid of, it's the peer pressure and mob mentality; the risk of being shunned and ostracized from the rest of society; and the fucking reality that you might have invested over a year of your life (which you can't get back by the way, and the jab might have just shaved off a couple, too) in a huge fucking scam all so you could narcissistically virtue-signal and prance around with a fucking face-diaper on. </p>
<p>GET OVER IT. Eat your humble pie with a side of crow and fucking come back to reality already.</p></p>

        <p>When I was 16  I got a summer job on.the Carney circuit, traveling with the carnival.</p>
<p>I worked with a Pitchman, a guy known as Red that pitched "Maverick Magic Cards". This was a shaved deck for doing card tricks, every other card the same.</p>
<p>He could make a deck of cards dance. He had a whole patter, that took about 15-20 minutes start to finish to attract a crowd, demonstrate the product and make the sales.</p>
<p>He was the Pitchman, my job was known as Stick. In that environment, nobody want to be the first one to buy... to actually pull out their money... so that was my job. </p>
<p>To hang around unobtrusively, wait till the demo was underway and subtly join the crowd at the back, and when He said "...and they're just $3..." I was supposed to hold out my money and proclaim loudly "Yeah, I'll take one of those!" </p>
<p>After I bought, other people would pull out their money. No one wants to stand alone.</p>

        <p>I think maybe it's part of the reason that I believe what I do...</p>
<p>I understand that no matter what activity you are engaging in, people have studied it, and studied behaviour, and studied and refined how to manipulate people.</p>
<p>I have been exposed to that.</p>
<p>I know about the DeBeers Diamond campaign.</p>
<p>I understand "Shell Gasoline with Platformate".</p>
<p>I have read the book "The Clam Plate Orgy".</p>
<p>I have read books on the grocery industry, where they have determined how many inches from the floor the cereal shelves should be.</p>
<p>If you want a better chance of selling your house, bake some cookies or cinnamon rolls just before the showing.</p>
<p>Nothing is left to chance, nothing is random.
We are carefully studied, and just as carefully manipulated, each and every day.</p>

        <p>This is beautiful.  Well observed.</p>
<p>I used to study magic.  This was such an interesting experience!  The concept of misdirection is a very powerful tool, and I feel like we see this daily in the main stream media.</p>
<p>I also had an era in my life where I was a busker.  We always noticed we would go on these "runs" where suddenly everyone is giving money for a while.  And then suddenly it stops.  It was like waves, and the waves began when one person came up, maybe danced a little jig and deposited money. </p>
<p>Once or twice we experimented with one of our girlfriends or something putting in money at the front of the line.  And sure enough it worked.  I guess this was like the "stick" you are describing.</p>
<p>I know about DeBeers too.  I'll have to read about those others you mentioned though.  </p>
<p>Cheers!  Thanks for the great conversation.</p>

        <p>You can experience it in your daily life too. I’ve seen a revolving door that was stopped, and 15-20 people ended up standing around just staring at it. Nobody even <em>thought</em> to simply push the door. They waited for a dude to come turn it on again, and out they all went. People can be so immensely dumb that it’s not even funny.</p>

        <p>It's not really a scam.
I was not doing boiler-room telemarketing, bilking seniors $350 for a $40 water filter.</p>
<p>It's using psychology to overcome buyer hesitancy.</p>
<p>The deck of cards was WORTH $3.
A normal deck of cards at the time sold for around $2. This was a trick deck, and came with instructions, and was good for parties. The average person could learn to make it work in a few minutes. They wouldn't be as skilled as Red was, making the moves seamlessly... but they WORK.</p>

        <p>Everytime I see posts where people are saying things like, " to anti vaxxers,  if you want to get sick and die go ahead I don't care! " I always want to ask how many unvaccinated people do they know got very sick to the point of death or near death or even on going symptoms? I have yet to meet anyone who knows anyone who dealt with anything more than a really bad bout that they got over. Also elderly and immune comprised people would already have had a slim chance with the regular bad flu that goes around every year.</p>

        <p>I said that Boris Johnson wasn't going to let us out on June 21st and people still mocked me. Now they're like "OH WE CANT OPEN UP NOWWWWWW ITS TOOOO EARLY". Fucking months + months + months. My mental health can't be bothered with you fools anymore. Think I'm developing some kind of psychosis or something too because of all this, no kidding.</p>

        <p>Here in Alberta, we went into serious lockdown at the end of November, ostensibly for 3 weeks until a reevaluatuation. I honestly couldn't believe how everyone I talked to actually believed we would be opened up in time for Christmas. I was skeptical. I was sure lockdown would last <em>until March</em> and I still felt like such a whacko when I said it. When March came and went, I had a hard time because I had honestly been expecting to open by then.</p>
<p>We reopened July 1st.</p>

        <p>In BC, Bonnie Henry announced in January that restrictions would last until, you guessed it, July 1st.</p>
<p>They did relax "outdoor social gathering" restrictions in May, but the rest of the timeline was pretty bang on. We went into "phase 3", aka no masks, on July 1st.</p>

        <p>The vaccinated people are putting their masks back on and crying about how "in danger" they are even though they're immune now. The behavior of the covid cult is the best evidence against the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. If it really works, they'd have burned their masks.</p>

        <p>Y’all are insane dude, there have been exponentially more horror stories from contracting covid and the after effects. The reason the mask mandate is coming back, is because clowns like you all refused to get the vaccine and now, omg, there are more cases!! This vaccine has been more thoroughly tested than any of the MANY influenza vaccines that you, YES YOU yourself have gotten throughout your life. And look at that, you’re still healthy enough to spout bullshit on reddit. How big do
your egos have to be to really believe that the government is out to get you because “you know what’s really going on here” The only reason the government is “targeting” you people, is because you are impeding progress for the rest of us. You would roll over for a dystopian fascist if they beliefs aligned with yours so don’t think you’re above the sheeple. It’s the exact same thing except your shepherd is Alex Jones</p>

        <p>I vaccine shouldn’t require others to be vaccinated in order to work. The whole point of a vaccine is improve the chances of survival for someone who is at risk of death by getting the sickness. How is forcing everyone to get a vaccine saving anyone? The only people who need it are people that have respiratory issues or 60+. Forcing children with a 99.98% survival to take a vaccine that is causing large numbers of terrible side effects should be criminal. Our view is to take the vaccine if you want but don’t force people, especially children, to take it.</p>
<p>Vaccines aren’t a cure. People who have had the vaccine still get sick with covid, still spread covid, and still can die from covid. The risks of covid are much less than the risks of the vaccine. </p>
<p>99% of people survive covid so shouldn’t you vaccinate the 1% that can die from it instead of the 99% that aren’t at risk?</p>

        <p>The variants are all less deadly than the original that wasn’t very deadly. Your attempt at an argument is totally devoid of logic. Feels good to smugly signal that virtue though, right? I honestly pity people like you. Your life must be terrible if you think doing this is a good use of your time. You honestly thinking anyone’s friends and family are laughing at them for not taking part in this experiment also tells me that you lead a very lonely existence.

<p>11,000+ people are in VAERS as dying after receiving the injection. How many of those stories have you heard? You wonder why?</p>
<p>&rt;The reason the mask mandate is coming back</p>
<p>masks do nothing</p>
<p>&rt;This vaccine has been more thoroughly tested than any of the MANY influenza vaccines that you, YES YOU yourself have gotten throughout your life.</p>
<p>one vaccine isn't equal to another injection</p>
<p>there will be <strong>double</strong> more VAERS reports for the COVID injections than all vaccines combined since the system was put in place</p>

<p>you haven't just rolled over for a dystopian fascist, <strong>you're cheering them on and demanding it</strong></p>

        <p>vaccines tested more?  that is not true.  these are still in their phase iii trials.  once all data is collected, research published, fda will decide.  </p>
<p>a few of the studies were sadly invalidated because the researchers choose to unmask the control group.  this has reduced the validity of the results, and potentially leads to fda rejection.</p>

        <p>Answer me this - How is this more thoroughly tested than many other vaccines, when we're figuring out new possible side effects from it practically every other week? I don't care how "thorough" the tests were - Sometimes you need to wait a year to see certain effects, sometimes you have to be under very specific circumstances to see certain effects, sometimes you need to also see if baby's born from vaccinated mothers have any side-effects. You can throw billions of dollars at a product, but you can't replace the time needed to properly study it. mRNA gene therapy has never been so widely used, is it that unreasonable to wait until we can make a more informed decision? If you feel ok taking it, great, go on and take it, the protection that the vaccine offers is for those who take it, since you can still catch covid and transmit it after getting vaccinated.</p>
