    <strong>Nurse Economics</strong>
    <p><p>I recently had dinner with a few clients of mine and one of them brought their wife -- a nurse who was on the "front lines" last year battling Space Dracula aka Covid. She's not nursing anymore. In fact, she practically bragged that she worked so much last year that she amassed $456,000 in overtime so that she could take a "break."</p>
<p>I was about two scotch and sodas into dinner and I just couldn't take it anymore. I said, "Quite fortunate for you. Not fortunate for everyone who was bankrupt by their governments for not being essential." She asked me what I meant and I said, "The problem with last year is we allowed health professionals, like yourself, to govern our economy. The problem is you all don't know anything about the economy. If it were up to you all, we'd just have a world of Doordash workers and medical professionals."</p>
<p>She then proceeded to tell me that it was preferable to a world of death. I just couldn't take it and I finally shut up, ate, and they left right before we all had coffee. The fear porn among these people is insane.</p></p>

        <p>I bet that idiot thinks we should lock down for the delta variant too.  I'm curious, did that self righteous, pompous nurse mention their thoughts on the delta variant?</p>

        <p>Yes she did. She thinks we should lockdown again. </p>
<p>When I told her I thought it was insane she said, "Well everything I do and how I understand the world is through science."</p>
<p>I responded, "Well, you see. As someone trained as an attorney just like your husband over there, I understand the world through laws. You know? These written things that prevent me from taking away people's lives or freedoms without just cause. I'm pretty sure our Founding Fathers are rolling about their graves considering 2020 was the year our government took the 14th amendment and just wiped their asses with it." (Her husband had to tell her what the 14th amendment is. She shut up when he quoted, "...no state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without the due process of law.")</p>

        <p>Yeah, I got extremely frustrated with my friend who's a nurse and was WAY too OK with everything.  Have not talked to her since January I was so annoyed.  Thanks for nailing what's so obnoxious about these people.</p>
