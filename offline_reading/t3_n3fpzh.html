    <strong>I went on a vacation and got sick. ?</strong>
    <p><p>I, a filthy unvaxed who has hardly ever been out of my home state, caught the sniffles after crossing two state lines and visiting many gas station restrooms to attend a family gathering/party. </p>
<p>So I did the responsible thing and quarantined at my boyfriend's place; who I travelled with; away from my elderly father. </p>
<p>I accepted the risks as a healthy individual and protected my loved ones of my own accord. Because I have agency, I am responsible for myself, and I can take care of my business without government interference.</p>
<p>Fear of (what turned out to be) the mildest cold I've ever had isn't going to get in the way of living my life as I see fit.</p></p>
