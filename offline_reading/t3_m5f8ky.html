    <strong>Remember, you CAN be arrested for trespassing.</strong>
    <p><p>If a business requires masks and you refuse, and then they ask you to leave, you are now trespassing and you can be arrested. Most of the videos that we see of people being arrested for “not wearing a mask” are actually of people technically being arrested for trespassing. </p>
<p>I don’t agree with it and I think it sucks, but if a business asks you to leave, leave and take your money elsewhere. </p>

        <p>Im not a lawyer. But I think there is a civil rights issue here waiting to happen. </p>
<p>People with disabilities are a protected class. If you have a disability or medical exemption, and the business refuses service to you for not wearing a mask, that is discrimination. </p>
<p>The same is true if you made a rule saying no masks allowed, then a muslim woman in a burka comes in and you refuse service because of your rule. Well, now you are discriminating against a protected class and a million lawyers will be lining up to sue you. </p>
<p>If your wondering why this hasnt happened yet. Well, our rights have already been trampled on for decades at the whims of the MSM machine.</p>

        <p>I see your point but I agree with OP.  Just because we don't want to wear masks that doesn't make us a protected class.  In my opinion we should all show some maturity and class and if asked to leave do just that with no drama other than perhaps an amused look on our faces.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm not saying that either. I'm just saying that a business cant always just refuse service willy nilly and theres nothing you could do about it. </p>
<p>I personally wouldnt make a huge deal about it but I am just generally against the defeatist attitude that theres nothing we can ever do. If you have a legitimate exemption there is a case there and that is the reason if you say you have a medical condition, they cannot do anything. </p>
<p>Its like if someone is robbing you at gunpoint. It is sensible to just give them what you have. But. Your also well within the law to pull a gun and blast em, but your also gonna have to deal with psychological trauma, a lengthy court process, and lawyer fees. For a lot of people, just giving them the cash is easier than going through the alternative.</p>

        <p>I see your point.  That said if I'm asked to leave an establishment of any kind I walk.  Only happened to me once and that was in a bar when I, unfortunately, had to extricate someone from my general vicinity due to his aggressive and obnoxious behavior.  It was club policy but the bouncers were quite impressed.  But nah man. If you go into a place that requires masks and make a scene you're the asshole.  It is my opinion that during these unique times it's incumbent on us to comport ourselves with dignity and class.  That includes not being a problem in public and trolling other subs.  While I do not in any way agree with the maskholes they do have a right to their opinion misinformed as it may be.  Let em muzzle up while I sit over here and quietly chuckle at their foolishness.</p>

        <p>If you are cannot wear a mask due to a disability and they refuse service, you don’t need to wait until there is a trespassing charge to take legal action.  Their refusal of service is the crime.</p>

        <p>You are so correct.</p>
<p>I will not do business where I have to wear a face covering.  Its the same as if the business requires me to wear shoes or a shirt.   If you dont like it, leave and dont do business with them.  Its called freedom.</p>

        <p>You're correct about the persons with disabilities.<br>
However a business has the right to refuse service as long as it is not based on that disability.  If there is a medical exemption in play, then that's a different story and benefit of the doubt should be extended.</p>
<p>But OP is right.. Just leave..be polite, say nothing, turn and leave.  Go elsewhere.  Once you remain on premises after being asked or directed to leave you are trespassing.  Just leave.</p>

        <p>If you have a medical exemption they must provide reasonable accommodations. For a bank, they can claim that a person who can’t wear a mask can use drive up or online services. Now, for things you must do in person like opening an account or applying for a loan - I really don’t know what their policy would be, but that might be grounds for an ADA violation claim.</p>
