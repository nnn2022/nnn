<title>How stupid are Covidiots that they don’t even realize that their “consent” to take the experimental vaccines is merely coincidental with their master’s imposed will, but not a real choice at all? These people are fully delusional about their real condition in society!</title>

        <p>not to mention the pharmaceutical companies have absolutely no liability if the vaccine harms you &amp; you’d have no right to financial compensation. it isn’t a choice and if it fucks you over…. oh well i guess??? as someone who can’t access affordable health insurance and has chronic illnesses, it could ruin any chance i have of ever achieving my goals and dreams. and put me into severe medical debt. </p>
<p>i really don’t understand how people don’t think these things through.</p>

        <p>The way around that is to sue the federal government for absolving the liability from big pharma. The Govt will likely have a fund set up...it's in the SPAR John Hopkins simulation.</p>

        <p>i’ll have to look into that, granted i think suing the federal government would probably end up not so good for me. they’re all crooks and the rules don’t apply to them lmao</p>

        <p>Where is there an "experimental" vaccine?   Medical science developed the  vaccine.  Medical science also developed the polio vaccine in 1961.  Of course we probably knew a lot less then so if something was going to be called experimental to me that would be it.</p>
<p>I do get why there could be controversy.   Read this about the development of the vaccine and how they chopped time off building it.</p>
<p>https://www.sciencenews.org/article/covid-coronavirus-vaccine-development-speed</p>
<p>&rt;Even so, more than 1 in 5 Americans say they won’t get vaccinated, according to a recent poll by the American Psychiatric Association. Among the reasons that often pop up are worries that the vaccines were developed too fast: Normally, drug research takes years or even decades from idea to reality. The first vaccines to combat COVID-19 were developed, tested and given emergency use authorization in 11 months.</p>
<p>However, realize this was reported near the end of June before the delta variant and other variants took hold.  These highly infectious strains  of the virus are causing massive problems - namely people going to the ICU and the hospitals are getting filled up - in Florida, and Louisiana, and other places and it isn't limited to them. It could happen in other states as well.</p>
<p>The virus really doesn't care whether the governor of a state is competent or whether he just sluffs  off the problems to some city mayor. The virus doesn't care.</p>
<p>We have to care.</p>
