    <strong>I don't believe the virus is even being spread at all anymore. I think it's gone and we're all being lied to.</strong>
    <p><p>Here in the US and in many other western nations the stats have always been inflated, with unreliable testing kits and the overwhelming number of deaths being falsesly labeled as Covid deaths, and the definition of "hospitalizations" in the stats being purposefully vague.</p>
<p>When you look at Japan, it's pretty clear that the virus is basically gone. Japan was among the first countries to be hit and it's barely made an impact.
The active case count and death count remain incredibly low and hospitals have plenty of open beds. 
Tokyo has barely been touched, despite the extremely dense population and the impossibility of social distancing for much of it. 
The streets are vacant due to paranoia, but there was never a lockdown aside from temporarily shutting down nonessential international travel, there was no forced social distancing, and there certainly wasn't any "new normal".
They're trying their best to return to normal, but they're not being ravaged by the virus like the US supposedly is.</p>
<p>It's all propaganda and lies and I'm sick of it.</p></p>

<p>If you think we are systematically being lied to by them, what exactly makes you think the beerus was real in the first place? </p>
<p>What if it existed only on the TV-screen and in some stories that shills liked to spew, but was essentially simply a pretense to bring north-korean levels of fascism to the west? That seems by far the most likely to me.</p>

<p>I do think it's real.  I live in a smallish town and we have a university here and some Covid research is being done.</p>
<p>Those people are scientists and research assistants and lab workers and some have had their job for many years. Some might even be fans of X-Files and conspiracy stuff.</p>
<p>So .. what are they looking at when they go to work every day?</p>

<p>This puts you still in a position to blindly trust complete strangers (appeal to "authority" as well) who are economically dependent on the system and in many ways invested in it (also possibly deliberate deceivers, not necessarily but that could also be the case and certainly helps a lot).</p>
<p>And if some of them are into conspiracy stuff, you won't hear from them it were one when they are in their work roles would you?  Who knows maybe they share privately exactly these thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>And is there even theoretically the possibility for the university to openly state on their website:</strong> "<strong><em>we concluded the virus is a complete hoax made up by the who"</em></strong><em>.</em>  I think it's obvious that they are not open ended researching stuff at all.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So .. what are they looking at when they go to work every day?</p>
<p>I guess a screen with text on it for the most part.</p>
<p>And there are many ways to waste your time researching stuff that has a nonsense base but is in itself not necessarily useless, for example they could research the amount of oxygen deprivation one gets when wearing a mask etc. etc.</p>

<p>This is true.  But then how do you explain extremely "anti-" doctors who <em>do</em> believe the virus exists, even if they also believe the reaction to it is crazy and even deeply disturbing?   </p>
<p>I can entertain the idea that there is no virus at all .. but then that raises all kinds of questions on it's own that I find really hard to rationalize. More probable (to me) is a real existing virus, overhyped.</p>

<p>If you see some of those and they have a significant view-count, they are uttermost likely controlled opposition, deliberately promoted and are simply spewing their script, which is slightly less -deliberately- irrational than the mainstream narrative. The reason is to not completely loose rational people, but to keep them stuck in this hoax as well, and to do that, they point out a few irrationality with the mainstream narrative to keep them in the general thought-box.</p>
<p>Lets look at this in another context to make it more clear: </p>
<p>It's like two guys are discussing about what amount of "drug regulation" were "best". </p>
<p>A says only "hard drugs" should be considered a crime, B says all drugs should be considered a crime. They're diving into the details and throwing numbers at each other but ultimately will both be wrong, because whatever they realistically conclude will have a fundamental flaw: </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Some politician has not the right to send men with guns after you to throw you into a cage because you happen to like green crumbles in your cigarette. And caging you for no reason at all is an extremely severe crime, and a form of torture. As normalized as it is - it is peak fascism to throw peaceful people in cages because you don't like some think they enjoy and harms no-one else. The cops doing it are the criminals as well as the politicians. </p>
<p>And now you may see why the whole discussion about "drug regulation"(threats of violence against peaceful people) is completely irrelevant and flawed - because the underlying premise is simply wrong - someone else doesn't have the right to throw you in a cage - or even kill you when you resist, because you like weed, doesn't matter if they are a politician, or 1 billion other people demand it from them - doesn't change anything in the situation, it is still an extreme crime.</p>

<p>Ok fair enough. But do you have any doctors who support <em>your</em> position that the virus doesn't exist at all?</p>
<p>Or would you say "they are probably all just staying silent"?</p>

<p>Why would I even care about the status of the one stating the claim, I have my own critical thinking skills, I don't outsource that one strangers with questionable motives.</p>
<p>It's blatant appeal to authority. Doctors aren't right just because they are called "doctors". Same is true for "experts" or "scientists". Slapping these words on someone doesn't make their claims true by definition.</p>
<p>There might be doctors sating the same as I do, but it's irrelevant who specifically says it, what counts is the logic and consistency behind it.</p>

<p>Well so I have a problem with this then.</p>
<p>Because there are doctors who are risking their careers and their reputations by going against the mainstream.  But all of them that I have seen do agree that a virus exists.  They are suspicious. they are skeptical, but they also arent seeing anything (apparently) that is leading them to believe that the virus isnt real.</p>
<p>If you cant produce a doctor who agrees with your idea, I do find that a bit odd.</p>
<p>Because then I am left with a hard-to-believe scenario, that has <em>no</em> support from anyone who impresses me.</p>
<p>I mean .. there is <em>you</em> .. but unless you got some meaty credentials or experience, I dont know why your opinion should carry much weight?</p>

<p>It's asking "why are there no experts who agree with you"?</p>
<p>You could say the moon is made of green cheese. Who knows? But for me, personally, to really consider that as a possible option I would want to see some scientists who agreed with you on that.  Without that, I say "Why are there no experts who also sem to share this idea?"</p>
<p>To consider a "hollow earth" I would want to see a scientist backing the theory.</p>
<p>I wouldnt say it renders it false. But it really makes me think, why are there <em>no</em> experts who seem to believe this, and only "laymen"?</p>

<p>Are you serious, it is the most blatant appeal to "authority" I can think of.</p>
<p>All that is necessary to convince you that the moon is made out of blue cotton is apparently an "expert" telling you so.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>And a "scientist" is someone who is part of the system and it's narrative, otherwise they are no scientist anymore (you said it yourself they risk their career, so someone stating the earth is hollow is at that point in time +a few hours not a scientist anymore because it goes against the narrative) - so what you're saying is beyond the most blatant appeal to "authority" also a catch-22 on top of it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm curios if "expert" 1 claims A and "expert" 2 the exact opposite B - whom do you gift your faith?</p>

<p>Not at all. But that's a nice <em>start</em>, to know that somewhere out there there are people that are putting their careers behind this idea.</p>
<p>&rt;And a "scientist" is someone who is part of the system and it's narrative, otherwise they are no scientist anymore (you said it yourself they risk their career, so someone stating the earth is hollow is at that point in time +a few hours not a scientist anymore because it goes against the narrative) </p>
<p>Yadda yadda. I know the argument. So show me a discredited non-mainstream scientist who supports the idea.</p>
<p>I have already said my big problem with the theory. I think there are too many people around the world who think they are looking at "something" when they look at Covid, and I cant think of what that could be, or how it wouldnt just be really weird to be them. The day-to-day coffee talk. Devoting your life to this stuff, and now you are studying a virus that doesnt exist, and somehow that doesnt bother you.</p>
<p>I just find that hard to envision.  The scenario doesnt pass my "kick the tires" test.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm curios if "expert" 1 claims A and "expert" 2 the exact opposite B - whom do you gift your faith?</p>
<p>Then it depends on their arguments.</p>
<p>But what you have is expert 1 claiming "A", and you have the exact opposite .. "B". But you have no experts claiming that.</p>
<p>So what is your strongest argument there is no Covid at all?  You think there is no virus known as "SARS-CoV-2"?  Koch's postulates and such? Lack of isolation?</p>

        <p>It's not gone - and it's not going away any time soon. It's yet another coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). There are many of them. Fortunately it's not very dangerous to most demographics. An old friend of mine has it right now and she's been pretty sick for over a week but seems to be better the last few days. Frankly I wouldn't be worried at all if she didn't have chronic bronchitis and some other health issues. Still, she's well under 40 and will in all likelihood be fine. She is living with her older parents though so they may be more at risk.</p>
