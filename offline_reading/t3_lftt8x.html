        <p>I have wanted to ask this for a few weeks now. Some of the people in my country who now complain the most about lockdowns are the same ones who insulted people who opposed the lockdowns in the beginning.</p>
<p>I know they were brainwashed and all, but it's a little but ironic that the same lady who said you didn't care about health, now complain about her mental health collapsing.</p>

        <p>Yes, but mostly because I think these people have been victims of genuine psychological abuse for the last 12 months from government and the media. </p>
<p>The mass psychosis ends as more and more people drop out of the delusional bullshit, some people dropped out 9 months ago, others dropped out 3 months ago. What's important is that everyone hopefully drops out of it eventually.</p>
<p>One day we may even get to a point where we collectively realise that this was one of history's greatest fiascos, and that we did it to ourselves.</p>
