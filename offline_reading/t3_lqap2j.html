    <strong>What the hell is wrong with Utah?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in Tennessee, but I'm visiting Utah for some additional training in my field.</p>
<p>Tennessee is basically open. I don't have to wear a mask anywhere unless the business specifically asks me to. I've been told by my company that if I'm outside here in Utah I'm required to wear my mask at all times and that is the law.</p>
<p>Our company has us spread out in different hotels in the Salt Lake area (West Valley City and Salt Lake City), and one guy at another hotel got tattled on by hotel staff SEVEN TIMES because he wasn't wearing his mask when he went out for a cigarette. He's outside, away from the building, smoking. How and why is he supposed to wear a mask when he's away from people with a cigarette in his mouth?</p>
<p>I thought this was a red state? I figured it'd be in the same vein as Tennessee where it was almost completely optional. It feels like Washington/Oregon-lite.</p></p>

        <p>I go to Utah quite a bit. I've never experienced any of that. Outdoors no one was wearing masks.</p>
<p>But Utah isn't like some of the other red Western states. They're more like Texas. They don't mind tyranny if it's done by the guys they voted for.</p>

        <p>It’s too close to Colorado, which has Boulder in it. /s</p>
<p>It also might have had more to do with the smoking than the rona bs. </p>
<p>Salt Lake City is beautiful and an awesome place to visit, I highly recommend it, but in my experience they don’t have a lot of patience with smokers, maybe because of the whole Mormon thing. I don’t really know.</p>
<p>I haven’t been there since this crap started though so don’t know what it’s like now.</p>

        <p>It’s true, smoking is more frowned upon utah, so that person is being real petty.</p>
<p>My experience in Utsh was where there are mandates, they are not enforced.</p>

        <p>Utah is very divided politically. And I can say that as a Mormon and having spent a lot of time in Utah. There’s a large population that does everything they possibly can to show they are absolutely not a part of the Mormon church or anything that’s related to it, included being a conservative. There’s also some people that say that wearing a mask somehow has to do with loving others so you’ll get that there too.</p>

        <p>Pretty much any urban area anywhere is going to have more restrictions. Salt Lake City is no different. I live in Utah, and I haven't experienced any of that. There definitely isn't any outdoor mask wearing requirement. That is not the law. Masks are required in government buildings, and most stores require masks. And enforcement is going to depend on how much the particular employee believes in masks. But the further you get from downtown Salt Lake, the less people care. I live 30 minutes south, and while I do lazily wear a mask when I go to the grocery store, that is about it. And people go maskless all the time (still fairly rare). I don't wear masks at my office, not in gas stations, not in restaurants (just when you walk in), not in movie theaters, never outside. Utah has been very lax the entire time. Masks are really the only thing making things still not feel normal. And I have never been harassed for not wearing a mask or not wearing one correctly.</p>

        <p>I live in Utah. The problem is the city, as is the case everywhere in this country. I travel all over. City people are cunty, country folks are usually not. </p>
<p>Anyone who says this isn’t political is a liar. City people are generally liberal, and country folks are conservative. We all know this. </p>
<p>I still generally do what I want regardless of where I am.</p>
