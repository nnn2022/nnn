    <strong>More cases among younger people</strong>
    <p><p>I thought "Fearmongering" was a very appropriate flair for this article. I'm 35 and my mother just sent it to me, I'm sure because it spiked her worry about me declining the vax.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/12/health/b117-covid-variant-young-patients/index.html?fbclid=IwAR2LWArBQZfawZdqdaGJDVYfCPwh33T2rlY8jLEBvUSs1mto3b8_UQ7TSQg">https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/12/health/b117-covid-variant-young-patients/index.html?fbclid=IwAR2LWArBQZfawZdqdaGJDVYfCPwh33T2rlY8jLEBvUSs1mto3b8_UQ7TSQg</a></p>
<p>No denying there's some alarming content in there. And it would make any mother worry, with the way it's phrased. For example:</p>
<p><em>"I cannot tell you how many people I've taken care of in the ER who are in their 20s, 30s and 40s, who are never sick enough to end up in the ER with Covid, but who now have long-lasting respiratory difficulties," Ranney said.</em> <strong>This makes it sound like a high percentage are long-haulers.</strong></p>
<p><em>"Covid-19 doesn't have to kill you to wreck your life."</em> <strong>That one I'm aware of. It's already done so (with The New Normal)</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>"</em></strong> <em>Throughout the pandemic, doctors have noticed some young, previously healthy patients suffer from Covid-19</em><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cytokine-storm?redirect=true"> <em>cytokine storms</em></a><em>. That's basically when someone's immune system overreacts -- potentially causing severe inflammation or other serious symptoms."</em> <strong>This is similar to the Spanish Flu situation, when young people were at the highest risk because their immune systems overreacted. But clearly they're slightly different immune reactions, because most cytokine storms with COVID actually occur with older people:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>file:///C:/Users/user/Downloads/jcm-10-00297-v2.pdf</strong> </p>
<p>I don't see any reports of cytokine-storm fatalities in young people (but I could be wrong--if so, please show me a link), which may explain why the mortality rate under 30 is near-zero. </p>
<p>I'd guess I'm also too old for that hyper-active immune response in the under-30 crowd. For me personally, the one that scares me most is the long-term loss of taste. But upon research (and that's pretending Google-found studies are reliable), 95% regain smell and taste within six months--and on top of that, it <em>seems</em> most long-haulers had pre-existing conditions. To sum it up: no route is risk-free for anyone. But at this point, the cons of taking the vax still clearly outweigh the pros. Let me know if you want to share any:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Studies or new data on the frequency and symptoms of long-hauling</li>
<li>Personal stories of prolonged symptoms</li>
<li>Personal thought process when considering the pros and cons of the vaccine</li>
</ul></p>

        <p>Yes, they know young professionals are mostly healthy and many have no interest in getting this vaccine, cue the fearmongering dialed up to the extremes.. I haven't known one person under 50 who hasn't recovered from supposedly having covid and were fine within a week or two.</p>

        <p>Ignore the fearmongering, esp. when CaSeZ mean positive qPCR tests with cycle thresholds ranging from 35-50. Those dying WITH C19 infection have 4 comorbidities on average. Young people will survive it in 99.99%+ of the time WITHOUT treatment. There's no need to waste your time reading CNN content.</p>

<p>I'm not concerned about dying--already have plenty of data for that. It's the claims of wrecking one's life without dying that had me alarmed; for example, going 5 months with no taste or smell, then have it come back only for everything to taste like garbage and sewage.</p>

<p>Even if that were to happen, it's still better than injecting yourself with an experimental vaxx. Most of the 'C19 long-haul symptoms' are psychosomatic.</p>

        <p>I would agree that's the lesser of the evils. That is...assuming normal taste followed. But if the garbage and sewage taste stayed for years or forever? Might have to reconsider. But we haven't seen this happen to anyone yet, and we have seen harmful vax effects. Plus I still think long-haul severity is linked to high-risk factors.</p>

        <p>&rt; the cons of taking the vax still clearly outweigh the pros.</p>
<p>I will have to strongly disagree here.</p>
<p>I am a physician and I have been taking care of COVID-19 patients for the last year. I have definitely noticed an uptick in the last 3 months of younger patients being hospitalized with COVID-19. This is anecdotal, of course, but it coincides with articles such as the one you posted.</p>
<p>And not only were these younger people being hospitalized, many of them have died. The last few I can think of were 21 and 33 years old. I have one now that is in his 40s that just got admitted to the hospital but hopefully will recover. The crazy thing I have noticed about COVID-19 is that it is wildly unpredictable in what it will do. Some people are fine for 2-3 days and suddenly require significant amount of oxygen and get worse rapidly, others come in sick as hell and get better all of a sudden. </p>
<p>As for the long-term affects, I have had patients come back to the hospital within a few weeks of being admitted and recovered from COVID-19 due to what appears to be a "flare up" of some sort. This is all so new that I don't think anyone knows exactly what is going on.</p>

        <p>he literally states in the video i linked that he isn’t anti vax, that he and his family are vaccinated for <em>everything else</em>. </p>
<p>what exactly is your point? most people in this sub aren’t anti vax.</p>
<p>and lmao that article does nothing but create straw men are simply add information to the claims he makes, not contradict those claims. this is nitpicking to try and frame his remarks as inaccurate or overall not worth listening to. a very weak attempt indeed. it does nothing to contradict Dr Cole’s main recommendations or conclusions.</p>

        <p>And I just skimmed the article quickly, but never got clear on whether that statement " <a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/208/garden-city-doctor-reacts-fact-checking-his-statements-lawmakers/277-6d4ba8c6-3eb7-4334-bfe2-2052c57a7e0e"><em>"I am absolutely not in the anti-vax camp, and I am concerned that these comments came across that way. I have been vaccinated. All of my children have been vaccinated,"</em></a> meant the COVID vax specifically or just, like you said, vaccinations for anything else.</p>
<p>But you're right...it would be a logical fallacy to focus on whether he actually took the vax or not--it doesn't change his arguments, even if he didn't follow them himself.</p>
<p>More than one instance has already confirmed his safety concerns, without even considering long-term. That's not just the blood clots, but also the fact that AstraZeneca is now discouraged for anyone under 30 (that's <em>after</em> they were rushed into taking it, not before).</p>
<p>Another thing that hasn't been addressed: most researchers agree with him that COVID won't disappear but will be endemic. This wouldn't be possible without the mutant strands--but the same people who acknowledge this are also saying, "The vaccine is effective against variants. It's <em>extremely</em> unlikely for you to get infected after you get vaccinated, and serious cases are eliminated."</p>
<p>Something doesn't add up here. If that were true, then this vax alone would prevent the endemic outcome (at least anything more serious than the flu, and if the vax remained this effective, it should even eliminate this type of non-threatening endemic).</p>
<p>But we don't see anyone thinking this way. If mutations mean an endemic outcome is inevitable, then sooner or later there will have to be strands that create a serious illness despite being vaccinated. It's even been estimated that this vax will be obsolete within 9 months of its initial rollout. That gives me even less incentive to risk the long-term effects.</p>
<p>One last point I haven't yet heard from anyone else, ever: wait until COVID actually <em>mutates against the vaccine.</em> They say the vax is still "fairly effective" against variants, but these are variants that evolved <em>before</em> the rollout. There's still a loose correlation (eg. it may be 65% effective against them instead of 94%), but now the virus can adapt to gain specific traits that resist this specific vaccine. So why wouldn't it keep mutating until the vax is only 10% effective against variants?</p>
