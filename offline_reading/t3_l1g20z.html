        <p>Good to know, thanks.</p>
<p>While there are some valid points, there are also a number of strawmen arguments, poor assumptions, and hyperbole. </p>
<p>To me it continues to ignore the main points of long term risk and cost/benefit analysis of the lockdown approach. </p>
<p>I'm sure it will be lauded as canon within the cult of Covid though. </p>
<p>Someone with more time than me may want to take on certain sections for deeper analysis and rebuttal though.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The most egregious thing that popped out at me was the "Claim: Lockdowns cause more deaths than they prevent," which they responded to with, "There is absolutely no evidence that lockdowns cause remotely as many deaths as Covid-19 has."</p>
<p>I'm not aware of anyone ever saying lockdowns are responsible for as many or more deaths than Covid. "Cause more deaths THAN THEY PREVENT" is right in the quote of the claim they're supposedly batting down, then they go on with their strawman.</p>

        <p>Thing is, we do not KNOW how many "would have" died from covid without lockdowns.</p>
<p>Same: we don't KNOW how many lives were "saved" by lockdowns.  It's all presumptions,assumptions, opinions, guesswork, and HOPE.</p>

        <p>The other part that got to me was the dismissal of the GBD...</p>
<p>There could be 15M "vulnerable" in UK, how do you supply and care for them?</p>
<p>That's it, must be impossible. ðŸ™„</p>
<p>What percentage are already carried for in LTC? 
Give them the support checks, with the rest of the economy flowing, there would be more resources.</p>
<p>The lack of effort, imagination, and vision our society has shown this past year is infuriating.</p>

        <p>How the other half thinks. Worth reading. While I donâ€™t dispute most of their stats, it is clear these folks, while well meaning, have very little regard for personal agency or responsibility.</p>
<p>Also, their response to The Great Barrington Declaration is just plain wrong. Donâ€™t say â€˜nobody knows how to isolate vulnerable peopleâ€™ after having shut down <em>entire continents</em>. This reeks of top-down management groupthink. </p>
<p>Additionally, (same section) evolution works both ways. If natural herd immunity was as â€˜badâ€™ as they say weâ€™d have been screwed a <em>long</em> time ago.</p>
