    <strong>Statement from Dr. Francis Christian, professor of medicine University of Saskatchewan</strong>
    <p><p>Dr. Christian, a professor of medicine at the University of Saskatchewan spoke as a member of a panel of doctors, critical of the lockdown measures and the overall approach to the corona virus. He did not mince his words or downplay his concerns, and for that he has been chastised by Dean of Medicine, Dr. Preston Smith,  and quickly labelled and condemned by the media, first and foremost the Saskatoon Star Phoenix among them, with not just one article but two, one after another. Expect more of the same with headlines about "consipiracy theories," and the rest of the media, particularly the CBC, also taking a whack at him.</p>
<p>Dr. Christian has now released a statement in response to the attacks and has done so through the Concerned Parents Saskatchewan Facebook, a group opposed to the indecent rush to vaccinate school children with unknown substances.</p>
<p>He explains:</p>
<p>"For many months during this pandemic, I have tried to influence the system from within and have not made any public statements.
My decision to make the video that has generated so much interest, is the direct result of the vaccine being rolled out at 'warp speed' to our kids. Not even a semblance of full and accurate informed consent is being made available to parents or children – and kids are being induced and incentivized to get the 'shot' in schools even without parental knowledge or consent."</p>

<p>Statement of Dr. Francis Christian FRCSEd, FRCSC, Clinical Professor of Surgery, University of Saskatchewan:</p>
<p>I am aware of articles in the press that describe the video that was released a few days ago, which featured five, licensed Canadian physicians, including myself.</p>
<p>I am also aware of the statement of the Dean, College of Medicine, Saskatoon, condemning me and the video.</p>
<p>As the video makes abundantly clear, I am a pro-vaccine physician.</p>
<p>Also, as my colleagues in the Saskatoon Health Authority will testify, I was probably the earliest (and persistent) advocate among physicians in Saskatchewan, for masking in hospitals.</p>
<p>I continue to be extremely concerned and disturbed at the attempts being made by social media platforms, other media and health authorities to diminish, degrade, smear and de-platform scientists and physicians who don’t follow the official narrative about the COVID19 Pandemic – including (but not limited to) narratives about lockdowns, vaccinations and early treatment protocols.</p>
<p>The eminent scientists and physicians who have been the target of unprecedented censorship, smearing and de-platforming include:
Harvard scientist MARTIN KULLDORF
an advisor to epidemiologists and vaccine committees worldwide,
Oxford scientist SUNETRA GUPTA
Stanford physician JAY BHATTACHARYAJ
Guelph virologist BYRAM BRIDLE …
and the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Early, effective treatment advocates (for example with the cheap and safe drug Ivermectin) who have been targeted for smear and de-platforming include Flccc.net / Dr. Pierre Kory
PIERRE KORY, ICU specialist and author of textbook on point of care ultrasound),
PAUL MARIK,the second most published physician in the world in intensive care, and;
UMBERTO MEDURI, the father of non-invasive ventilation,
which has played an essential role in the covid-19 pandemic.
These physicians are the founders of the Front Line Critical Care #FLCCC Alliance / https://covid19criticalcare.com</p>
<p>Why are they being suppressed and censored?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the same physicians and scientists with disproved and questionable theories, such as  NEIL FERGUSON of Britain and; ANTHONY FAUCI of the USA, are repeatedly paraded before the media, with no opposing voice or dissenting, expert opinions.</p>
<p>The media has ceased to play the critical role it is required to play. For example, the media has repeatedly put forward the claim that, “The four vaccines approved by Health Canada have undergone clinical trials and a rigorous approval process, both in Canada and other countries.”</p>
<p>This is not only false and simply parrots the official narrative, it is dangerous.</p>
<p>The four vaccines approved by Health Canada have not been authorized for use in the usual fashion – in Canada they are under “Interim authorization.” In our neighbors to the South, they are under “emergency use authorization.” In fact, full authorization of a vaccine takes several years and multiple safety considerations.</p>
<p>Emerging reports of myocarditis in children exposed to the vaccine are the latest in the list of adverse events associated with the new vaccines. The German vaccine authority released a statement two days ago that says it does not recommend the vaccine to healthy children/adolescents. Are the Germans not “following the science?” This issue is now the subject of an emergency CDC meeting that has been called.</p>
<p>Preventing harm is paramount. And already one of the four vaccines (Astra-Zeneca) have been stopped from use in Canada and several other countries.</p>
<p>The latter is only one of several scientific and professional issues that need debate and vigorous discourse before resolution. That is the way of science.</p>
<p>For many months during this pandemic, I have tried to influence the system from within and have not made any public statements.
My decision to make the video that has generated so much interest, is the direct result of the vaccine being rolled out at “warp speed” to our kids. Not even a semblance of full and accurate informed consent is being made available to parents or children – and kids are being induced and incentivized to get the “shot” in schools even without parental knowledge or consent.</p>
<p>Any attempt to silence physicians is destined to fail. The Nuremberg code specifically makes the acquiring of informed consent an absolute requirement in the care of our patients. The Declaration of Canadian Physicians for Science and Truth (www.canadianphysicians.org ) which I signed, together with my Ontario physician colleagues and concerned members of the public is already at 16000+ signatures. As the Declaration points out, any attempt to stifle physicians and their pursuit of the solemn duty and obligation of informed consent, may itself constitute a crime against humanity.</p>
<p>FRANCIS CHRISTIAN</p>
<p>p.s. This statement was made available to the Star Phoenix, which did not respond and did not publish it.
This of course, undoubtedly greatly strengthens my assertion that scientists and physicians are being censored in a disturbing and unprecedented manner.</p>
<p>I shall be releasing this statement elsewhere.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for posting this. Time will prove that these experts are right - and I fear that it will come at the cost of many more lives and livelihoods. Keep talking &amp; keep resisting.</p>

        <p>This will continue, and get worse.  The enemies of humanity will not stop, unless we stop them.  But the will to stop them doesn't seem to exist among the masses.  Complaining, writing letters, "voting" (LOL), seem to be the limit of what people are willing to do in the face of mass murder and mass infliction of misery.</p>

        <p>Does anyone know of a Saskatoon doctor who sees both sides and doesn’t blindly push the covid vaccine without acknowledging risks? I have heard of some but of course can’t find one as they will probably lose their license if they publicly speak about any doubts about covid vaccines. I’m looking for help for a covid vaccine injured family member</p>
