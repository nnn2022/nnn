    <strong>Anyone know how we got in the clown world?</strong>
    <p><p>10 years ago things were fairly normal but it seems like around 2012 things started to get more degenerate and by 2016 it was a full on clown world. Degeneracy is at an all time high. Absurd stuff has been normalized just in the last several years. The genders seem messed up too. It seems like 2012 was the last yeae I remember things being normal. Like you can't even compare the 90s and 2000s to clown world.</p></p>

        <p>The rise of social media, primarily. Years ago, getting  interviewed by the local news and having them air it was a bit exciting. You would call all your friends and tell them to watch the 6pm broadcast. Now, anyone with a Twitter account can respond directly to government leaders and have a chance for their message to be viewed. In order to stand out of this massive crowd, people have shifted to saying more outrageous and sensationalist things with little consequence outside of generating views. </p>
<p>Are you a proud vegan who wants to spread the message of a plant based diet? Is tweeting a plant based diet is all around a healthier and more environmentally friendly option going to generate buzz? Fuck no! Accusing a popular chef of cultural appropriation for using tofu while not being a vegan is what is going to get reposted.</p>
<p>Social media is going to be the downfall of the west.</p>

        <p>I think it's been going on for longer. People in power got weaker, spoiled and complacent with not having to fight for anything. The worst offenders are the most privileged. The most privileged have the loudest voice, went to the right schools and set the standards for their own children. </p>
<p>Boomers burned society to the ground and raised their kids on tech and antidepressants indoors. Everyone is now comfortable instagraming their stupidity, they're unaware of nature and the natural order and the broken system supports their decision to get paid more on welfare than being afforded the chance to do a hard day's work and get rewarded fairly for it.</p>
<p>I'm an atheist and even I recognise that they've done away with all forms of "spirituality", community, answering to something bigger than yourself with a new "religion of self". </p>
<p>To fix this, I'm rejecting the new normal. I'm spending more time outside. I don't watch TV. My children will be as free range as possible and they won't be encouraged to burn themselves out with academics or climbing some make believe ladder or swooning for likes.</p>

        <p>Slowly at first. Then all of a sudden...  But probably when Critical theory was introduced into colleges in the 60's. then it slowly turned into the PC movement in the 90's. I think Gamergate and the mass usage of social in the late 00's and early 10's is where the acceleration into clown world started to take off</p>

        <p>This is actually the correct answer. Critical theory and Marxism has been slowly chipping away at Western society since the '60s. The object of this was to ultimately dominate culture but it was to do that by breaking down pillars of our society. The first objective was actually destroy the nuclear family, which black lives matter is still trying to do. Things such as welfare state do incentivize urban families to crumble. Critical theory then made its way through the cultural institutions and took them over. Hollywood? Gone. Academia? Gone. Journalism? Absolutely dead. </p>
<p>It all was slow at first wasn't it? Then I think around 9/11 it really began to speed up. The internet was taking shape and "conspiracy theorists" were starting to come out of the woodwork And the news media really started hammering away on the population with misinformation. From there it just seems like a snowball gaining tremendous momentum, Facebook accelerating the chaos to supersonic levels, the election of Barack Obama really stoked the left, then gamergate came out and put critical gender/race theory right in our faces and that puts us to where we are today through the presidency of Donald Trump to this pandemic and vaccination efforts. </p>
<p>I don't believe we have hit terminal velocity of societal decay. I believe there will be civil war, I actually believe it has already started.</p>

        <p>Yeah i don't think we were in a clown world until after the Gamergate shit happened and Bruce Jenner came out as a woman and they legalized gay marriage. Right around that period and when Trump and Hilary started running for president is when things went haywire. 2012-2014 were pretty much the same. This stuff was happening gradually year by year, decade by decade until around 2015 and now it's just a clown world that keeps getting more clownish every year. Hell every month at this point.</p>

        <p>The laws changed where we used to not be allowed to direct our government funded propaganda at our own citizens domestically. This law was changed around the time Obama left office and trump entered office. Combined with runaway government spending, where the propaganda basically has limitless funding, means a lot of a propaganda.</p>
<p>Also, look around your own families and friends, how many of them depend on the government for money? Whether welfare or government employees, very few people are involved in working in the private sector, and participating in a real market. Similar to being in debt, being on the government payroll changes how people think.</p>

        <p>I think itâ€™s important we stick to facts. Yes we are being fed propaganda, by the media and the government, but what law was changed to direct it at Americans? If this is real I want to know but Iâ€™ve never heard that before and I do pay close attention to this type of thing. </p>
<p>As for dependence on government youâ€™re correct that many/most are getting SOME type of benefits from the feds but Iâ€™d hesitate to say very few people are in the private sector. At this point.</p>

        <p>Could be to do with meme culture thinking about it and how information can be spread and taken seriously without critically thinking about what is in front of you. </p>
<p>Tools like facebook, twitter, instagram etc allowed people to rapidly send information as well. Also it feels to me like a lot of people like playing the victim so maybe a large percentage of memes that resonated with people we're aimed at victimising.</p>

<p>But I've posited a few times that everything really started going haywire a few years after they got the Hadron Collider up and running at CERN.</p>
<p>The time frame matches yours.</p>
<p>But it seems like we started accepting absurdity at a more frequent rate around then. </p>
<p>I don't buy the "it's social media" thing, personally. The prevalence of absurdity has never affected humanity's acceptance of it before. </p>
<p>My parents never use social media and, as devout Christians, it's completely absurd for them to be Trump supporters, and I don't believe they ever would have been 20 years ago. He's objectively evil. But they voted for him twice and hope to vote for him again in 2024. </p>
<p>You can't explain that stuff away as just "social media and the internet affected things." My parents don't participate and they've still been affected. They don't have cable either, by the way.</p>
