        <p>&rt; “Pellagraphobia" developed as the disease acquired a social stigma that  left victims and their families ostracized (4). Many hospitals refused  admittance to patients with pellagra and many staff refused to care for  them. Quarantine was common and elementary schools tried to bar children  whose family members had pellagra (5). The cause of the disease was  unknown. A number of etiologies were proposed including infection; the  eating of moldy corn; inherited susceptibility; heavy exposure to  sunlight; and exposure to cottonseed oil (2). There were more than 200  proposed "cures" for pellagra included diet, arsenic, castor oil,  quinine, strychnine, and the healing waters of mineral springs (5).</p>

        <p>&rt; The Commission conducted a survey of pellagra cases in the cotton mill  districts in South Carolina where it was especially common. In its 1914  report, the commission concluded that pellagra had no relation to diet,  that it spread most rapidly where sanitary disposal of waste was  poorest, and that the disease occurred almost exclusively in people who  lived in or next to the house of another person with pellagra (6). The  general consensus was that pellagra was likely infectious.</p>

        <p>&rt; In 1937 nicotinic acid or niacin was found to cure pellagra in dogs  (16). This finding was soon confirmed for human pellagra (17). The  final, almost complete elimination of pellagra dates to the 1940s  coinciding with improvements in diet and a requirement by many states to  enrich food with vitamins including niacin (18). What provoked the  epidemic at the beginning of the twentieth century is not entirely  clear. However, changes in the methods of milling corn may have led to  the outbreak, because the germ or embryo in the corn kernel is removed  in the new milling process begun at the turn of the century. The kernel  contains a high proportion of lipid, enzymes, and cofactors, including  nicotinic acid (19)</p>
