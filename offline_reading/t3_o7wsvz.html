    <strong>Keeping people in fear, isolated, and distant is the worst thing you can be enforcing during a "pandemic"</strong>
    <p><p>You're sitting alone in your room doing something to keep yourself entertained. Your feeling good and then all the sudden you jump when you cough. You panic thinking it could be Covid or something else. When in reality your throat was just dry because your thirsty. You get the sniffles worrying that could be from Covid, but in reality it's just because Summer is coming back. More pollen is in the air than ever before and you tell yourself that to calm down.   </p>
<p>Perhaps you zoom, video and or voice chat with your family or friends. People ask if you're okay. You reply "Yeah I am fine" or sometimes they ask how you've been feeling seeing if you got Covid because, they want to know if you're healthy. You tell them "I feel fine and no I am not sick". You ever realize you haven't been asked if you're actually feeling okay. That just because you aren't sick from Covid they don't ask you anything else.   </p>
<p>This is the true damage of masking, distancing and isolating. People have been more programmed to only ask if you are feeling sick. When in reality you're really wanting a hug. You really want to be next to someone interacting with another human being in front of you. That isn't just in front of some dumb screen. You wish you could be hanging out with them going out to eat with them. Or you want to hang out with them in the same room. Go on a trip either by yourself or with them.   </p>
<p>Yet things are back to normal and you're not okay. You feel like your distant toward others or other people are distant toward you. All those friends and family you would text or go see communication has either decreased or gone completely. You don't know what brings you joy anymore even when you do go out. It's like you're stuck in this survival mode that is only focused on whether or not you are alive. You tell people you're great because you are alive and things are returning to normal. When in reality you spent a whole year or so hiding from people either at home, behind a mask or even both. Not being able to see if someone is happy or sad. Yet now you can see people's faces and it's like your brain can't process how they are feeling. Even though you can clearly see them smiling, laughing or not smiling.  </p>
<p>THIS is what is so wrong about a "new normal". Where people are more "digital", some will wear face coverings, some will stay away from others, some will not even know how to feel or react to what people say or do now. We are supposed to respect those who are still nervous of the virus and not bother them. Yet that person who's still scared hasn't had any kind of human contact within the past year or so. THIS is the new normal everyone wants? To just live our lives and not be bothered when someone out there is suffering mentally. Yet we can't tell because of a mask. We can't tell because they don't want to go up to someone and tell them they are hurting when they are "too concerned about the delta variant".  </p>
<p>WE NEED TO BE IN A WORLD WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONNECTING IN PERSON. WE NEED COMFORT NOT SOLITUDE. TO GIVE LOVE AND SUPPORT FOR EACH OTHER! A LOT OF PEOPLE SPENT A WHOLE BLOODY YEAR IN SOLITUDE! WE NEED PEOPLE TAKING OFF THEIR MASKS SO WE CAN SEE HOW THEY ARE DOING. INSTEAD OF WORRYING SO MUCH IF SOMEONE HAS A BLOODY FEVER (because if they actually did have a fever they would likely be a home resting wouldn't they). WE SHOULD BE MORE WORRIED IF SOMEONE IS FEELING WELL. IT WON'T MATTER TO THEM IF THEY AREN'T FEELING WELL FROM COVID IF THEY ARE STRUGGLING JUST TO GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING!  </p>
<p>We need to get to a point where people can connect again and with none of this digital bullshit. Otherwise the stuff you see on the news with all this violence, "unruly" passengers, crime, etc. it's going to get worse the more people are going into society again.   </p>
<p>Yet people see us as the bad ones...for wanting love and peace when we know what's really toxic here. That being the media, restrictions, isolation and just the lack of enjoying life.</p></p>

        <p>Keeping people in fear and isolation is cruelty. People need companionship. God himself said it in the beginning "The LORD God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.” " Genesis 2:18</p>
