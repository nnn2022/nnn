    <strong>"God Bless"</strong>
    <p><p>I. Am. So. Sick. Of these nosy little housewives saying this to me when I don't have a mask on. I'm sure someone has said this on here before, but I'm sick of it, so I had to say it being as it happened to me earlier. Do you really have SUCH a hero complex that you have to say it? Well, of course you do. That's the only reason you're wearing a mask in the first place; to feel like you're doing something important. Even though you're not. And just the chipper christian 'god loves us all' way they say it makes me want to puke on their face. Maybe I should! That would freak them out. </p>
<p>Also,  I <strong><em>LOVE</em></strong> how the news and everyone talks about "droplets", but a few days ago there was a "tearjerking" photo of a woman hugging a police office during all these riots and she was "crying" all over his chest. I guess droplets are okay when it's in protest? Haha, I feel like I'm going crazy here. I'm supposed to live in one of the worst cities in the western US, and yet, everyone is eating this up. I guess crack does make you paranoid, so it's expected of most people here.</p></p>

        <p>Honest question, does “true Christian” even mean anything? Most dedicated Christians I’ve met always say they are “true Christians” and the guy over there is not a “true Christian”.</p>

        <p>A lot of these people are ignorant and fake Christians. As a Christian I will never wear a mask and I'll tell you why. It's because I know that the Bible teaches that there is going to come a point where no one can buy or sell unless they take the mark of the beast and I believe this is definitely a precursor to that. The mask wearing shows obedience to the system and allegiance to the new world order ("new normal"). That's why you're seeing all these places in lock step mandating mask orders all at this same time. It isn't coincidence, it's planned. This whole thing is a complete lie and deception that the whole world is falling for. Most people will accept the mark, few will refuse it and suffer as a result. Ignore them. You understand what they do not. It takes a stedfast person to not cave to the pressure of being a mindless drone and following the status quo, and to put yourself in a position to be ridiculed or chastised even though not wearing a mask is completely sane and normal. But this is the "new normal" they are creating, and it needs to be met with resistance.</p>

        <p>Yes, as a man of faith, I make it point to demonstrate my values through service and kindness to others. Mainline Protestants and the majority of Roman Catholics are not out to convert anyone. And insofar as judging the sincerity of another person's Christianity, remember what Jesus himself said about such sanctimony: <br>
"Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then  shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye." (St Matthew Ch 7 v 5)</p>
<p>I am terribly sorry that so many Christians not only insult other Christians with such uncharitable arrogance but that these folks find it perfectly acceptable to make assumptions about the goodwill of those of other faiths or none. It is the most <em>un</em>-Christian thing one can do. And using it as a cover for their coronaparanoia is even more despicable.</p>

        <p>I’ve taken to saying “Those with medical conditions are not required to mask, so if I see someone without a mask, I respectfully assume that is the case. I would never attribute malice to a person when I really don’t know their whole situation, because it would be malicious of me to do so.”</p>

        <p>Where are you, OP? I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area. I never wear a mask, and I've never had anyone say that to me. I'm sorry you have to hear that all the time. It sounds infuriating. Cultural differences throughout the US are so interesting to me. </p>
<p>I would probably give them a big smile and say as sincerely as possible, "Thank you!" It would probably be the only smile they saw that day, with everyone in public masked and their family members at home miserable living with them.</p>

        <p>I'm in Albuquerque, NM. It. Is. Horrible. It's tweakers acting self righteous mixed with the most stuck up social justice idiots you will ever find. It's a weird mix of people.  And it's always been like that, even before all of this cov id crap. There are a lot of a lot of cool and smart people here though, I love and hate it here. It's better than Denver, at least (which is where I'm from). </p>
<p>Haha, you're right about the only smile they'll see all day. Don't you find it funny that SO many people, before all of this, would complain and wish they had so much more time with their family, and now that they have it, they practically want to kill them. Oh, actually they are killing them, here in NM, (and there was another case in Texas), a guy admitted to murdering his entire family because he was locked-down with them for three weeks. I'm not trying to laugh at murder and death, but I just think it's so ironic that most everyone says they want a family, but they actually hate them when they are around them. </p>
<p>Yeah, and I would say thank you, but I just prefer to ignore them, because you can't win with those people. If they think you're being sarcastic, they'll feel like you're "damaged" and need their prayers, and if they think your 'thank you' is sincere they'll feel like a hero and that they "reached someone".</p>

        <p>Fake ass Christian responses always make me feel weird for some reason, probably because they come from a place of socially-expected ingenuity. Part of it might be that it's because I am personally nonreligious, but I would rather have a Christian tell me "Hey man, how are you? Hope you get better, let me know if I can help" than going "I'll pray for you, god bless you" before completely forgetting about the conversation a minute later. To me it's the same as going "Re share and like if you care" and then not actually giving a fuck. </p>
<p>But back on the topic of New Normalism, the types who go "God Bless" on Twitter in response to anything typically are Karens from my experience. Karens are the ones who are getting a kick out of all of this and using this whole situation to score social brownie points.</p>

        <p>I'm an Episcopalian (eek, imagine what it's like to be horrified by the new normal in a liberal Protestant denomination--the chilling effects are awful) but as I live in St. Louis County and work in the City of St. Louis--neither of which have been real hot spots, ever, and have an oversupply of ICU beds if really needed (Wash U and SLU Med, plus others), I have to start wearing a mask in our swampy, hot summers if I cannot "social distance."  </p>
<p>What a load of BS. St. Louis is not Manhattan, and it is so incredibly easy to stay six feet away from the few people who would even want to be outside on a 96 degree day here. This doesn't even mention that the City is requiring masks to be worn while working out in gyms--even at private clubs--and I would imagine the county is not far behind. It's difficult enough to breathe here in the summer with pollution and humidity; but I guess dying of heatstroke is of course better than contracting asymptomatic Covid-19.</p>

        <p>No...most St. Louisans are Catholics. Episcopalians are the most stereotypically "WASPy" denomination, and while we have the same general structure as Roman Catholics, our priests marry, can be women, and so on. In short, it's somewhat like Roman Catholicism but theologically liberal. We are the historical descendants of the Church of England in the colonies. Hope that helps.</p>
