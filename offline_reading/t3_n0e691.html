    <strong>The dynamics have changed post-vax</strong>
    <p><p>We need to adjust our stance now that it is quite clear that Dr. Geert Vanden Bossche is correct for the most part. The shedding of worse strains in the vaxxed is a real threat now. So for items such as Indias spike, as it could well be true based on Bossches stance, let's not immediately suspect that the media is lying as usual but find out from the ground whether the cases and deaths are indeed going up, because if they are - this will do damage to humanity. Likewise lets carefully use this juncture to onboard pro-vaxxers who should by now begin to realize they were wrong. But this also means that we may need to dial-down on the anti-lockdowns as it could be necessary now :( any other or better suggestions welcome of course.</p></p>

        <p>The "pro-vaxxers" will never concede that they are wrong - the psychological terrorism of governments means that many of them are irretrievable in terms of their mental health.</p>

        <p>That's true but they also say the bigger lie the easier to convince. If they're that convinced post vax issues, it can only be a lie they believe.</p>

        <p>I don't care. I'm not going to do anything differently. Already immune to the virus and don't give a flying fuck. No lockdowns, no fearful hiding, no nonsense.</p>
<p>India is not having a real COVID spike. They have deaths from malnutrition and possibly a combination because people severely weakened by starvation and poor sanitation are more susceptible to illnesses that would barely even slow down a healthier person.</p>
<p>&rt; But this also means that we may need to dial-down on the anti-lockdowns as it could be necessary now </p>
