    <strong>Why I Think It's Possible Some Places In The World Are Headed Towards Genocide or Violence Against Unvaccinated Persons</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Prelude</strong> </p>
<p>Hi. Before I begin this post. I just want to say that it should go without saying I hope that I'm wrong. I hope that the world doesn't go here. At the same time, there is a dark trend that <em>some parts of the world</em> are headed towards. </p>
<p>In the United States and some other nations, it may not happen (hopefully). However, in other nations (ie. Australia, Canada, my current un-named nation), it is very well possible for the reasons that I am about to provide. </p>
<p>I hope that we can wake people up to this insanity, to the government corruption, and the truth about Covid, however let's not be too optimistic; it's easy to look at history and say, "oh wow the Nazis were so evil towards the Jews," but few are willing to talk about the 1930's in which things slowly stirred up. </p>
<p>Just like how "2 weeks to flatten the curve" has led to "indefinite on/off lockdowns," it's also possible that this leads to genocide, or at the least... Violence of some sorts. </p>
<p>Let's jump into this. </p>
<p><strong>The Stages of Genocide</strong> </p>
<p>There are multiple models. I will be referencing <a href="https://www.keene.edu/academics/ah/cchgs/resources/educational-handouts/the-eight-stages-of-genocide/download/">this one</a>. No specific model is right/wrong; some have 10, some 8, some whatever. Just keep in mind I'm mentioning this one, and the meaning is the same. </p>
<p><strong>Classification.</strong> It's obvious already how those skeptical of the vaccines are being classified as separate. These people are being dehumanized as "unclean," for example France's newly announced "Sanitary Pass" implies that if you do not have this pass, then you are "dirty." </p>
<p>The <strong>organization</strong> and <strong>polarization</strong> are abundantly clear as well. The "anti-vaxxers" are blamed as the sole problem of increasing covid numbers and lockdown. "Take the vaccine to end lockdown" is what the governments are saying, while at the same time saying that "everyone needs the vaccine in order for it to be effective." </p>
<p>It is clear that in the aforementioned link we are at Step 5 (Polarization), with Step 7 being the active extermination (step 8 is denial). </p>
<p>In fact, I would go so far as to say that polarization has already occurred, and now it's simply a matter of whether or not we will move into the 6th stage, preparation... </p>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong> </p>
<p>Up until these past few days, I simply had this genocide theory in the back of my mind as something that <em>could</em> happen, but at the time was unlikely. Now I have my doubts. </p>
<p>The "Sanitary Pass" and "Vaccine Passports" do an excellent job of segregating society. </p>
<p>When it is inevitably discovered that many of the vaccines do NOT work, I believe that it is possible that the unvaccinated will be blamed for future mutations that affect those that are vaccinated. This is because those obsessed with the vaccine are so indoctrinated as to be completely unable to consider the opposing viewpoints within the vaccine-skeptical spectrum. </p>
<p><strong>Massive Prison Development in UK</strong> </p>
<p>The UK have already begun development of <em>massive</em> prison systems. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGKXjl3L4MI">SOURCE</a>. Furthermore, the particular one mentioned that video is next to a crematorium. Having personally visited the Auschwitz camp in Poland, where the Nazis exterminated horrifying numbers of innocent humans, it makes me uneasy looking at this setup.** </p>
<p><strong>Coincidences</strong> </p>
<p>Biden wants to go door to door to shove that vaccine in your body. The UK is developing massive prison systems, and so are other nations. The vaccine passport is being forced upon people all around the world, whereas previously it was labeled a "conspiracy theory." The leaders of 3 nations that had rejected vaccines all got assassinated in the past month. </p>
<p>Coincidences... Or is there something going on here? </p>
<p><strong>Bioweapon Hypothesis</strong> </p>
<p>I have a few high-ranking contacts across the world that have informed me that this is bioweapon warfare, either by the Elites looking to seize control and power, or by the CCP. The details that have arrived to me are not entirely clear; there are multiple perspectives. This is why I call it a "hypothesis," and not a certainty. </p>
<p>Regardless, I do believe that there is something quite fishy about this. Maybe it was <em>accidentally</em> released from the Wuhan lab and then the governments of the world saw how they could use this situation to their benefit? OR perhaps it was coordinated by China. Or by the elites. </p>
<p>At any rate I do believe that there's something awfully fishy; the mainstream narrative does NOT add up. The bio-weapon theory would actually add credence to why government leaders are so itchy for lockdowns. </p>
<p>Note that the point of this bioweapon would NOT be to kill en masse, but instead to fracture Western society, scare people, and slow them down economically. We have already seen this. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> </p>
<p>There are still many things unclear about this situation, but it is abundantly clear that governments around the world are NOT to be trusted and the mainstream narrative is there to try control us. It seems that some nations in the world, such as my own, are headed down a very dark path, with the introduction of vaccine passports, the development of massive prison systems next to crematoriums, and extreme polarization. </p>
<p><strong>Prove Me Wrong - And Counter-Prep</strong> </p>
<p>Unlike the <em>Branch Covidians,</em> I am not attached to this belief and am happy to be proven wrong. All I wanted to do here is propose a few different ideas that I'd like to see discussed. </p>
<p>At any rate, I will be personally preparing myself however I can, for example acquiring documents, solar, clean water reserves, learning how to live in nature, and other misc prep. If I am wrong - which would make me a happy man - you'll see me in the bars having a blast, and I'd love to give you a cheers with the world waking up. I hope for that reality, but I also want to prepare for and consider the possibility of a darker reality. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Please do your own research and share your findings!</p>
<p><strong>Edit: HOPE</strong> </p>
<p>I wanted to add that from my research and other contacts it seems that if we can make it through August/September then we should be clear for things to look better. So while I'm tossing out ideas here, it's ultimately not prove-able whether it's true or not. We just have to see how things play out. If things are looking good, people waking up, people returning more to normal by September, I think we'll be clear. However we could also have another propaganda attack by then, at which point I recommend everyone just stay aware of what's going on. Look I could be right or wrong. This is just an idea, and it's not even my own. Ultimately we need to see how things play out and adjust accordingly. Wishing the best for everyone here.</p></p>

        <p>They aren't going to do it, they just aren't, this whole thing is a fear circus cold-war to scare people into "prepping" and rushing to mass vaccination clinics to get jabbed under the assumption (key word) they're protecting themselves. </p>
<p>What you're seeing is theatre pure and simple. I'm in Ontario Canada and our PM and Premier have tossed vaccine passports out (scrapped) out of the blue once we got to near 80% 1st dose leaving a lot of confusion for doomers (and people like you). The mandates are being scrapped, the IDs scrapped, leaving people feeling confused and lied  too "But Papa? You said that you would be mad at us? Papa you would never lie to me my dear Papa??". </p>
<p>The truth is, they're beating the drums of fear and paranoia through mass media similar to how a parent would bluff and claim to leave an unruly child behind in a busy WAL-MART shouting back "Ok, Timmy we're leaving you here, bye! See ya buddy we're out of here". I know a fuck ton of people who jumped to conclusions and anticipated the passports the moment the government started talking about them, these people said things like "You HAVE to get your shot, they're going to make it mandatory, I wanna be able to travel, I wanna be PREPARED".</p>
<p>My main point is the government has bluffed all of this, people are their own worst enemy, we tend to trust the everything the government says as facts, we JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS. </p>
<p>NEVER JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS!</p>
<p>So OP, you are just another victim, they got in your head, they scared you, you took them literally, they have you where they want you, you built their narrative for them. It's smoke and mirrors, don't fall for it.</p>

        <p>So what are they going to do then with all this fear they’ve created for us?? For one group, they’ve hyped up the fear so much (of the virus) that they’re willing to inject themselves with something they know very little about. For the other group, they’ve created fear so much (of not listening to the almighty govt) that we’re willing to prep or fight. The govt gets little joy or control out of that, I’m not sure what their intentions would be just to scare us. Do you have an idea?</p>

        <p>They're trying to MAX out vaccination numbers.</p>
<p>Look around you they aren't done yet.</p>
<p>Here in Canada our roll out is NOT done and we're projected to get another 10% of the population vaccinated in a few months. This marketing campaign is STILL going, once they reach a MAX cap (as high is they can get) they will stop the madness. </p>
<p>Repeat after me "This is a mass depopulation program".</p>

        <p>While I 100% agree with you on maxing out vax numbers. I’m not sure about the depopulation agenda. It’s certainly possible, but I think it’s much more likely that this is about money and the short term side effect profile is much higher than they anticipated.  I don’t think they care as much about long term effects as those can be denied much easier. But they want to sell as many vaccines as possible, as quickly as possible. So much money involved.</p>

        <p>Ironically money is a side effect of this global operation but they wouldn't go through a 12 trillion dollar sunken cost for a mass marketing campaign for the past 18+ months just for money alone (they already had all the money in the world). </p>
<p>Keep in mind that big business like WAL-MART and McDonald's actually lost billions of dollars in the last 2 years. </p>

        <p>I agree with your post and I argued as such in a Normiebook post about exactly this.</p>
<p>There was an immediate dog pile attack.  People all coming out of the woodwork to tell me how "stupid" I am.  How people were "offended".  </p>
<p>"THIS ISN'T LIKE THE HOLOCAUST!!" They shrieked.</p>
<p>"I know this isn't like the Holocaust." I said.  I never said it was.  I'm saying this is how it started.  </p>
<p>"REEEEEEE!!  SOMETHING SOMETHING YOU'RE RACIST!!  REEEEEEEEEEEEE!!"</p>
<p>Followed by the fearless dipshit leader of the group muting me.</p>
<p>Followed by everyone cheering.  </p>
<p>Followed by other dipshits saying, "see?  Now that cockroach isn't even defending his point." (I was banned from the group you moron.  Kind of hard to defend the point when you are banned.)</p>
<p>Yes.  I daresay you are correct.  This seems to be the beginning of something much more sinister.  </p>
<p>My prediction is they lock us all down in the Fall again, and blame "anti-vaxxers".  </p>
<p>I worry for our future my friends.</p>

        <p>&rt; Yes. I daresay you are correct. This seems to be the beginning of something much more sinister.
&rt; 
&rt; My prediction is they lock us all down in the Fall again, and blame "anti-vaxxers".</p>
<p>One of my contacts said August/September is the timeframe we should be looking out for, whether it be a bio-weapon attack again or media propaganda attack. If we can make it through September without a big public push towards the dark stuff, then I think we'll be clear for a true return to normal.</p>

        <p>Don't tell anyone. I erred telling 4 or 5--- 2 I was trying to warn. I am not hanging out with the vaxxed for this reason, I don't want blamed. Laying low sometimes can be the best bet. I want unvaxxed friends now who see through this BS. I think the unvaxxed are going to be blamed when they start dying from the vaxx. It will be a new "variant" that attacks blood vessels more, but it will the built up spike proteins that have killed them.</p>

        <p>Interesting. If you had said this kind of thing say a yr ago I might have thought, ha, no way... then I sat back and watched the masses literally bend over. So now I am thinking, hell anything might happen, and it really scares me tbh. Just recently I have been affected by it as well, as a favorite sporting event has been re scheduled for October out here in California, but I cant go as I haven't been vaccinated. They are not selling any tickets to you if you are not vaccinated. Even a negative covid test, no, you have to be vaccinated and you have to show proof. Makes me beyond angry. I am fit and fucking healthy as fuck. Its the first time I am getting personally affected by all this, in a big way. And I fear its just the start. Going back to what you say, I fear you have made points that I think are valid and also the assassinations you mention. I mean.... I don't believe in coincidences at the best of times.  Could you tell me who the three are please.... I know of two?</p>

<p>Same for me. I was quite optimistic in 2020, but I have decided to let go of optimistic and be realistic while still hopeful. Or rather hopeful in spirit, realistic in action/prep.</p>

        <p>This sounds all so familiar to 2008, the impending doom and crash, where the govt was gonna est  Marshall Law and cart people off to the fema extermination camps etc etc.</p>
<p>The prerequisites to genocide require a dictator wherein the political divide is /massive/.</p>
<p>From here you have the means to divide and conquer. </p>
<p>I would say that “the powers that be” use a lot more of a “soft power” to do that bidding. They won’t mandate a vaccine because that is hypocritical to the “my body my choice” and goes against lawful informed consent. </p>
<p>So instead they force you to have no choice but to get vaccinated.
Passports, restricted areas and maybe even bank account withdrawals.
They will force you into a corner and will use public opinion against you to make life so hard that you’re either homeless and dying “and that’s your own fault”.</p>
<p>Even vaccinated people will throw up red flags if a move to genocide people that aren’t wanting to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>On top of this, as covid disappears, there can be no drama for the media to report on and therefore little evidence to purport the threat so any motion towards violence against these people will be perceived as excessive and uncalled for.</p>
<p>The only way genocide could happen is if covid is literally ravaging and causing mass infections and death despite vaccination.... out of frustration with recovery, a new leader pops up and points the finger at the unvaccinated.
Now you have some “finally” doing something about it. “<em>those people</em>” are preventing <em>us</em> from living.</p>
<p>Out of that comes the modern witch hunts.
That’s how it could happen but I really don’t see it. There are too many prerequisites that just aren’t even close to happening.</p>

At the current status quo it's just not viable as people who refuse the gene therapy are much more likely to have boxes of .300BLK lying around ya feel me. Seems to me the queens commonwealth nations cucked themselves despite their constant jokes about american gun violence.</p>

        <p>Agree.  I think the potential "second wave" that is most likely coming this fall/winter would be an integral part of the plan to continue and further solidify the narrative of a panic, "new normal" worthy narrative.</p>
<p>My take is that if we indeed see a return to mask mandates, social distancing, lockdowns, etc over the winter, that by Jan/Feb the O.P.'s theoretical worst case scenario may well be real.</p>

        <p>We are in stage 1, Classification. The unvaccinated are being classified as right-wing, extremists, Republicans, conspiracy-theorists, etc.</p>
<p>Stage 2, Symbolism, comes next with the vaccine passports. During this stage, the unvaccinated will be identified. </p>
<p>It's still early in the game but I worry what the future has in store for us. The leaked Canadian MP letter stated that the unvaccinated will have their assets seized and will be held indefinitely as a public health risk. This falls in line with stage 5&amp;6.</p>
<p>But for now, we need to establish common ground with others. We cannot allow the propaganda to dehumanize the unvaccinated.</p>
