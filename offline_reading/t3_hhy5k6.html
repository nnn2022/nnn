<p>Here a translation of the article:</p>
<p><em>"Police seize sidewalk chalk at the Malieveld</em></p>
<p><em>Date: Saturday, June 27, 2020 11:47 PM</em></p>
<p><em>The Hague - The police confiscated sidewalk chalk from several people at the Malieveld on Saturday evening.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>"A few people were busy on Saturday evening with drawing hearts and texts with sidewalk chalk on a path along the Malieveld. In addition to hundreds of hearts, the text: 'For freedom and love' was also written on the path. A runner, who happened to walk by, thought it was a nice initiative and helped.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>The plan was to use hearts to chalk the entire path along the Malieveld. The police saw it happening and asked them to stop it.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>After extensive consultation with the police, the people had to stop chalking and the boxes of sidewalk chalk were confiscated. On Sunday they can pick up the confiscated sidewalk chalk at the police station. The details of the persons were also noted, after which they were allowed to continue their way.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>The organization behind Virus Madness would like to demonstrate again at the Malieveld against the corona measures. Mayor Remkes has banned the demonstration.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>The police are already extra alert on and near the Malieveld on Saturday evening. Councilor Boudewijn Revis fears that people will not care about the ban and will still come to the city to cause unrest. Last Sunday the demonstration against the corona measures ended in disturbances. The police then made more than 400 arrests.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>Video and photos: Daan van den End"</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here is my perspective of that evening:</p>
<p>Our mayor forbid the demonstration the next day and the municipality kindly "reminded" potential protestors that they could risk two months jailtime or 3600 euro fines for attending this very dangerous protest endangering national health.</p>
<p>I was going out for a jog and some pullups in the park in the forest in the evening. I ran past the Malieveld that was to be the location of the protest against both a law that even our national bar association condemned for being completely unreasonable and unnecessary in a human rights democracy like ours.</p>
<p>I posted before about the girl I know whose student house was illegally entered along with the bedroom by police to check for 1.5 meter violations between housemates.</p>
<p>I am not in favour of this hasty law for which I believe corona serves merely as an excuse rather than a justified reason.  I do not want to check under my bed for police, call me crazy I don't like it. I also don't like it if they suddenly lie next to me after illegally entering except if the policewoman in question is gorgeous and in for a swell time, I am jesting ofcourse. </p>
<p>The protest is also against the 1.5 meter rule as people do not feel corona is a threat big enough to warrant a societal dystopia. Some of the media scared everyone by continuously showing young people dying of corona, and now people are done with the hysteria. Also it is not fair to everyone wanting a normal life and it is unrealistic too, if you own a cafe in the Netherlands. There is no 1.5 meter distance possible.</p>
<p>Full airplanes are allowed if you wear a cloth before your mouth. Full terraces on the streets, people in the inner city are completely ignoring the 1.5 meter and i agree with them. Eventhough the 1.5 meter rule is suddenly gone for airplanes and for full traines by wearing a cloth before your face (full trains can you believe it) if you want to exercise your right to demonstrate in this country, it is an affair the government loves to deem as dangerous and irresponsible. Football games for christ sake will be allowed and the government pretends the supporters won't sing or stand too close to one another. But still don't these protestors know it is a pandemic? You should roll over and surrender liberties because we say so.</p>
<p>I jogged by and I saw three people drawing hearts. I asked them why and they told me that with the last demonstration, there was a lot of police intervention (I know I saw it too) against normal people. Water canon, police on horse, arresting normal people for exercising their right to demonstrate. The woman told me that she was hit in the head the last time while sitting down and peacefully protesting.  She hoped that eventhough the next day could turn into a battlefield, police and protestor would still be reminded that ultimately we are all human. And eventhough we might disagree now: love and liberty for all is something we should all cherish. Let's not grow hate each other and let's care for our fellow human.</p>
<p>We struck up a conversation and talked about how all of us had been impacted and we had a great time. She asked me if I was willing to join in and I said sure!</p>
<p>Because drawing hearts with chalk is not a crime, and a statement wishing people love and liberty should never be controversial. A heart should not be offensive to anyone, regardless of a demonstration happening the next day.</p>
<p>I wanted to draw too, because I feel for these people as I am one of them. A concerned citizen who values civil liberties. I emphatize with these people. And the protest ban that I deem more controversial than the protest had not been in effect yet. </p>
<p>I thought about not joining because I did not want to get in trouble and I was promptly ashamed of myself to for a minute of ever considering declining for this bullshit pathetic reason. I am not ashamed of chalking a heart to wish people liberty and love. </p>
<p>I never will be ashamed or intimidated into believing these things are controversial! </p>
<p>We drew the hearts, and 20 minutes later 5 police officers came up in two vans with shining lights.</p>
<p>They came up and they were nice though. They asked what we were doing and we said we chalked hearts for libery and love for everyone. Whatever happens on that protest the next day, let's not forget we are all humans and we all have loved ones.</p>
<p>The officers though they were nice said that we were not supposed to protest, and I said that the ban was for tomorrow, we were complying with the law. Still they kept trying to tell us that we were protestors, no we are not, the protest is tomorrow we just want it to not devolve into another grimm affair.</p>
<p>Still they were nice eventhough of our difference in view of this. I asked if we were to go or could continue and they said they had to discuss this with their superiors.</p>
<p>There was a 20 minute "politietop" overleg. "Top" here refers to upper management/leaders. </p>
<p>There was a 20 minute deliberation what to do with this situation and I personally believe they als deliberated on whether they should take us in:</p>
<p>For chalking hearts.</p>
<p>The officers at the scene, they changed a bit. I could sort of tell that they would have liked to tell us to chalk whatever it is that we want as we were not breaking the law. That they did not like their superiors were discussing a matter this trivial. </p>
<p>I legitimately asked if I could maybe not have to go to the station or sit in a cell for this as I do not want to get in trouble, and I could sort of tell that the police officer was face palming inside for this entire situation and the ridiculousness of this question being posed with sincerity and belief. That question was a sort of monthy python-ish level of crazyness. How did we ever end up here, that somebody asks not to go to jail for chalking hearts.</p>
<p>I still honestly think that it could have happened. My girlfriend is a criminal rights lawyer and she said that she could have seen it happen as more crazy things happen, but I might be wrong.</p>
<p>Local journalists enter the scene, tell us they really like the initiative, nice those hearts! They find it crazy funny that the police upper management is involved in a discussion what to do with these chalking deviants drawing hearts and all.</p>
<p>I was still busy chalking hearts as I could not leave and was nervous. Officer was still nice and said they started to look weirder and weirder and I told him honestly that I was getting nervous and did not want any trouble, with a nervous laughter.</p>
<p>Luckily we are being let go, and the police officers apologize for how this situation came to be and wish us the best before we leave. I think the officers felt as bad as we did.</p>
<p>But they did confiscate the crayons. They quoted The Hague municipality law.  Some people shared sources online that using crayons on the street has been taken out of that law in 2017 and it was illegal to take them from us. The woman pointed it out too but did not want to press it because atleast we could go. They could be picked up the next morning, but yeah crayons why bother.</p>
<p>And we left.</p>
<p>The police upper management had a 20 m discussion what to do with people using crayons to draw hearts.</p>
<p>On twitter and facebook it got some exposure and people were quite angry.</p>

<p>I was honestly happy that people also saw that this was unnecessary and disproportional.</p>
<p>I would like to say that these particular officers: I don't think they are to blame. They were really nice and they felt bad for us, I think it was the police chief and friends that created this weird situation. Please don't castigate them as they were hurt too I believe. </p>
<p>As the hearts indicate: these officers are fellow humans too, with friends and people they hold dear. We should never forget that.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you for standing against this dystopian madness, it's pretty brave to resist, even by drawing hearts. We are all under a new nazi occupation by corona-nazis. The low-level police are really victims of this as well, and we should speak kindly to them about the overall problem when we interact. "Just following orders" is not acceptable and they can still get in big trouble if they trample on freedom or do any kind of nazi-type aggression. The best they can do is look the other way until it's time to arrest the real culprits.</p>
<p>We need to put the focus on the chief corona-nazis like Jeffrey Skoll and Larry Brilliant until they are brought to justice. I was hoping that they would go to the Hague, but it looks like occupied territory at the moment.</p>

        <p>Nice post by the way. You should protest tomorrow anyway IMO. No government ever gave permission to protest anything worthwhile. </p>
<p>I'm watching different countries' reactions to this to help me decide where I want to live. Governments taking advantage of a situation to gain more power and control is hardly surprising and is a tale as old as time. What's new is everyone being brainwashed to be OK with it and I can't live near these people anymore.</p>
<p>Is it general consensus in the Netherlands that this whole thing has been overblown and is more than a little bit Orwellian? Would I get friendzoned for suggesting it's a bit crazy for people to wait for government permission to sleep with someone? (OK don't answer that last one, I'm still bitter.)</p>

        <p>Good luck by the way today.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask, about the atmosphere among the public in Netherlands. I'm really ashamed of all the fearful people here who are happy to ruin their children's childhood.  I want to move.</p>
<p>Is the general feeling of the public scared and happy to do what the government says? I want to know if I would feel more at home living there. Thanks for anything you have to offer on this.</p>

        <p>The media is sowing fear continuously. </p>
<p>Today there was an article about sick people that see people not care about corona. "People remember they are at risk." In the volkskrant.</p>
<p>Yesterday talkshow host said that it might be indecent to go on turkey holiday because his neigbours are 80 years old and scared. Travel agency guy says: "but you are 2 weeks self quarantine after as is the law?" You wont see them?
"But I take out the garbage he replies."</p>
<p>As he ofcourse forgot himself anyone would ever consider self quarantine while making really trying to act like a saint hahahaha.</p>
<p>News said gov minister is overwhelmed with the flights to Turkey being booked.</p>
<p>Now why would she be overwhelmed?
Because nobody cares about corona and people want to go eat nice kebab and drink like a king in turkey.</p>
<p>NRC newspaper's tom jan meeus suggested today corona protest is maybe astroturfing. Because everybody is really happy with the government according to SCP research. He said protestors want to decide for people that the rules are bullshit, not just for them but for others.</p>
<p>But we all know thats not true because dutch people are not retarded. NOS cut the footage today of the man and woman with the gun scared of the BLM crowd to make it seem like they were aggresive scared rednecks.</p>
<p>Luckily AD newspaper posted that 2.85 million dutch people do no longer care for corona news or the measures.
They called the people corona blockers and the ostrich crowd haha as "dont they realize corona is scary??" " here look at these scary absolute numbers oh no."</p>
<p>And there was a huge petition to stop coronameasures that the media is scared of even mentioning. </p>
<p>Only the media really doesnt understand: how can these people want to live</p>
<p>A NORMAL LIFE?!?</p>
<p>Dont they know</p>
<p>It is a Pandemic!!! Fear!</p>
<p>Atmosphere in the netherlands is relaxed. People are not scared of the virus anymore almost no one is except for a few risk people and well always crazy people.</p>
<p>Most people are normal and relaxed you are most certainly welcome here. Dutch people are not all the time yelling about death and how scary everything is. They cycle without helmets because they look stupid and you can cycle right? Yes saving lives but I dont want to die with this thing on my head, this is not how i want to be remembered (joke). You can smoke weed and you can still bang prostitutes and even full airplanes and soon soccer games are allowed again. Only real breaking point is that protest where people show that nobody cares about corona is forbidden.</p>
<p>We dont have any of the retarded " you cant have fun because of corona crowd. " Children here skateboard and play soccer and are exempt from rules.</p>
<p>Children are granted a normal life in the netherlands.</p>
<p>I would never leave this place when I see what democratic candidates spread in fear mongering and democrats wanting to close down business for people wanting to live.</p>
<p>This place: i intensely dislike my prime minister. </p>
<p>But I know for certain. He hates mouth masks and deep down inside hates the whole panic.</p>
<p>People overheard him saying" dat kutvirus ook" </p>
<p>That "cunt virus".</p>
<p>He is not saying that out of fear that I can tell you.</p>
<p>During intelligent lockdown there was an insane traffic jam to the beach.</p>
<p>People in my street have maybe paused hand shaking for a month.</p>
<p>But people here are not in the least bit scared.</p>
<p>I would move here today. </p>
<p>I was petting a cute dog 3 days ago and the owner joked he was dangerous and I said like this flu virus???</p>
<p>And we both shared a heartily laugh about it.</p>
<p>Dutch people have euthanasia. People can legally end their life if they are really done with it and suffering. We are most certainly not shunning death and risk as much as other countries.</p>
<p>I would shake your hand and welcome you!</p>
<p>Lets compare. </p>
<p>I am complaining about having to wear a mouth mask with almost zero chance of getting a fine in a full train.</p>
<p>In some countries they want you to be almost locked in your home.</p>
<p>Our prime minister thinks its horse shit to wear mouth masks. Why this inconvenience for this marginal benefit. Yes people die they always do.</p>
<p>People fly to turkey in a full plane and openly laugh how they are going to "self quarantine" with friends in public cafes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the media is trying to figure out if the concept of a holiday is now morally wrong.</p>
<p>This country is monty python.</p>
<p>The general feeling of the dutch public to corona is:</p>
<p>Aaaah yes the flu virus. </p>
<p>Takes sip at full public cafe* </p>
<p>terrible i am happy we are doing everything we can.</p>
<p>At beachparty dutch people we are dancing in close vicinity because we are doing our utmost at taking this seriously.</p>
<p>Not everyone is like this. But really I almost only know chill relaxed people.</p>
<p>We can go to prostitutes! Hahaha. We have to respect 1.5 meters in cafes but we can still have normal sex with paid sex workers!</p>
<p>Welcome to the flying circus.</p>

        <p>Legit if you hear anything going on in the UK, I’d absolutely drive down and attend wherever. I’m sick of minimal socializing and being cooped up at home all day, this is what I imagine cabin fever feels like. Just a constant desire to go out and do something or meet someone. </p>
<p>I’m happy with the friends I’ve got but god I wish they’d be more willing to ignore restrictions lol.</p>
