    <strong>"#filmyourhospital" vs. governors sending recovering patients into nursing homes</strong>
    <p><p>Issue #1: <strong>During the #filmyourhospital movement, people all over the world showed that hospitals were mostly empty</strong> while media was telling us they were overflowing with Covid-19 patients.</p>
<p>These people were censored, dismissed, and some were even arrested. We were told "they didn't go to the part of the hospital where Covid-19 patients are treated."</p>
<p><em>Okay.</em></p>
<p>Issue #2: <strong>Governors around the world ordered sick patients into nursing homes to recover.</strong> This led to an incredible number of deaths.</p>
<p>We were told they <em>had</em> to send sick people into nursing homes because there was no room in the hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>However -- these happened at the same time!</strong> <strong><em>Both can not be true!</em></strong></p>
<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Bonus links:</strong></p>
<p>You know about Cuomo and the others, but did you know Jay Inslee from Washington state did it too?</p>

<p><em>Excerpt:</em></p>
<p>&rt;A week before the letter was sent, Governor Jay Inslee was already issuing proclamations recognizing the need to protect people aged 60 and older from the virus‚Äî which begs the question why a department under his authority was asking for nursing homes and care facilities to take COVID patients.</p>
<p>Here's a link where a younger Covid-19 patient sent into a nursing home ended up beating and killing an older man:</p>

<p>---</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The hospitals had space in them. Why did the governors order sick patients of all ages into nursing homes where the most vulnerable people are?</strong></p>
<p>PS. I lived in King County ("the Wuhan of America") at the time and I saw firsthand that the Bellevue hospital was almost entirely empty. It was closed to non-essential services, so most of the hospital could have been used instead of sending these people into nursing homes!</p>
<p>The two giant Covid-19 overflow treatment tents outside of my work were never used. The community center which was taken over for Covid-19 treatment was never used.</p></p>

        <p>It makes me want to wretch that they did this. Yes, why indeed!</p>

        <p>Some people have responded to me, "Well... That's just what you do when you have no space for them."</p>
<p>1) We had space in the <em>empty hospitals</em>.</p>
<p>2) That's not "what we do" -- I don't know of another time in history when we sent sick people into nursing homes where the absolute most vulnerable people are.</p>
<p>3) The fact this was never really investigated and people weren't held accountable is questionable &amp; concerning.</p>
<p>4) The coordinated nature of governors in multiple states and multiple countries all taking the same action is highly suspect.</p>
<p>5) The censorship around the issue -- not being allowed to talk about it on social media -- also suggests foul play.</p>
<p>In the end this is one of many incredibly controversial events around Covid-19, but we are flooded by so many that we're hit with something else before we could fully digest this one.</p>
<p><em>But any one of these types of issues is enough to discredit the lockdown enthusiasts.</em></p>
