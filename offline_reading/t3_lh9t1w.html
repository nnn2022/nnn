    <strong>Why exactly did masks suddenly become some amazing new forcefield against germs and viruses?</strong>
    <p><p>I was reading last night and I was seeing articles about the flu season from years past (one from 2013 for example) that said wearing a mask would probably not prevent you from getting flu or colds.</p>
<p>Well now suddenly they are a magical forcefield against Covid and viruses, and unfortunately, even if Covid is no longer an issue they will never go away.</p>
<p>I keep reading from people saying they haven't gotten sick in the last year, so they will always wear masks.</p>
<p>Well I see two problems with that statement. One is I rarely get a cold or sick anyway, so is it really worth it to wear a mask to prevent that (if I supposedly even works)? And two, let's say the mask really did prevent you from getting sick for a couple of years, but suddenly, you caught something. Would you not end up getting very ill because your immune system would be so weak?</p>
<p>I mean, it's up to people to wear them if they want to, it's their choice. But I'm not looking forward to having to look at a sea of masks for the rest of my life. And I can tell you I will not be wearing one to prevent some little cold or flu, and if I am sick I will stay home if I can absolutely do so to avoid wearing one.</p>
<p>I don't want to live in a society like China or Japan where it's considered impolite to not wear a mask. It's just stupid. I had a nasty person on here tell me "wearing  a mask was like washing your hands after going to the bathroom, F****face." Well too bad, I don't see the correlation. We've never needed masks 24/7 before, and I don't care if it's some new normal, I DON'T like it. So leave me alone, Mkay?</p></p>

        <p>Well I've already had covid and for me it wasn't even as bad as flus I've had before so I'd tend to agree. For a cold? No way I'd even consider it.</p>

        <p>Oh same, I’m almost certain I had covid last year but I never got tested and I agree, it wasn’t fun but it was nothing compared to the flu I had a few years ago that laid me out on my ass.</p>
<p>All I’m trying to say is I would take any amount of risk of getting even that awful type of flu again (I think it might have been H1N1, I could barely stay awake for more than 4 hours a day) over wearing a mask, and definitely not for colds.</p>

        <p>EXACTLY. I had COVID in January. It was way less than the flu. The worst part was sitting at home alone for a week thinking all day how I had some horrible disease. </p>
<p>More people need to realize that it is MILD in the VAST majority of people. We destroyed society for this. And to truly be honest, I am having a tough time associating with anybody that continues to go along with this bullshit narrative.</p>

        <p>Seriously... can we just separate and have our own, sane society that functions outside of /alongside the crazy society?</p>
<p>Oh wait, no, we can't, because the crazy society also happens to be authoritarian, which inherently means they want to force you to never leave it. </p>

<p>I'm not afraid of the virus, and you're not going to make me afraid of it. For the majority of people it's nothing. OK? You're not going to make me afraid of this virus. I already go out to eat, go to the gym pretty regularly. I'm not going to cower at home until they tell me it's "Safe."</p>

        <p>That's fine. That's your choice, and I don't think you deserve the downvotes you're getting for saying that you would choose to wear a mask. That IS your choice, and always will/should be. It's if/when you start demanding that others make the same decision with their own lives and faces that it would become a problem.</p>

        <p>Yep.  Japanese mask culture isn't "Oh I wore a mask today because my husband is sick and I might be asymptomatic."  It's, "I feel like absolute ass today and want to stay home, but if I do my boss and coworkers will shame me, so I'm gonna sit at my desk sweating, coughing, and sniffling for the next 10 hours."</p>

        <p>Might be an unpopular opinion, but that actually kind of makes sense to me. </p>
<p>If the “normalization” of masks only related to wearing one when you are symptomatically ill and have to be in public, it actually does kind of make sense because you aren’t sneezing and coughing everywhere as much when you might not have time to get to a tissue.</p>
<p>That should also include changing the mask if it gets gross while you’re such, because that’s proper use of PPE.</p>
<p>If all they asked was for symptomatically sick people to wear them (which was the original guidance before all reason left this planet entirely) I’d be like ok that makes sense.</p>
<p>Wearing one all the time when you’re not sick is 100% stupid though.</p>

        <p>Yeah, exactly. That asymptomatic spread bullshit is such fucking bullshit that I refuse to wear a mask on principle. If and only IF I were literally sick, well, I would just stay home, but if I had to move about in crowded indoor spaces then sure why not? If the health authorities and governments would RECOMMEND, not MANDATE them this way, I'd have no problem with it.</p>
<p>I don't wear a mask cause I haven't been sick in the whole of 2020 and frankly, I'm furious at how the governments have handled this thing. They don't respect the general public AT ALL and are trying to treat us like fucking toddlers.</p>

        <p>I woke up about 6 weeks ago and was feeling 'off'.  Got to work and checked my temp.  101.  Saw the night manager about 20' away and told him to sanitize everything I touched and went home for a week until my fever had been gone for three days and I felt relatively normal again.  Got tested negative 3 days in and had to get tested again before I was cleared to work.  I'm saying it was the flu.  So it's not gone.  But it all boils down to personal responsibility.  If you feel sick stay home.  It's pretty simple to me.</p>

        <p>You seem to understand. </p>
<p>Why is wearing a mask BEFORE 50% of the population gets the vaccine a big issue?</p>
<p>This has killed more people than 10 viruses combined. You don't have to be afraid, but a mask doesn't stop your life. </p>
<p>There is a reason to stop it. Vaccines. Shutdowns for 6 weeks and then masks.....but doing nothing hasn't worked. America proves that. Australia proves that shut downs work. </p>
<p>Yes. Large cities will always have incoming goods and a lot of infectious people, but shutdowns do work. When they work, being smart works too.</p>
<p>Mandates are also part of government. If you live in society you have to accept that. Always has been. It's not new. Been going on for 4000 years. The government makes choices to help society.</p>

        <p>lol there's a ton of viruses around with a lot higher mortality that this. If you're afraid stay at home!!! and wear three masks while inside your home. I live in Romania which in like 2015 was the first in Europe at cases of tuberculosis. You know that usually when tuberculosis is found PERMANENT lung damage has already happened? I had a case in my high school class. We got one lung xray and no one mentioned it again. Man why can't l live on a different planet than ppl who think like this.</p>

        <p>America proves what? Florida has minimal restrictions and it's doing better than other heavily restricted states which are pretty much dystopian nightmares at this point. And Australia, man, holy fuck, I'd rather shoot myself point blank in the face with a bazooka than live in a police state like that.</p>
<p>We can't alter society to go fundamentally against human nature for every random ass contagious disease that pops up. They've been with us since the dawn of time. We've always been fine. People die. That's why we fuck and make more people. Because all of us are gonna die sooner or later. But I'd rather focus on making this world a better place for the coming generations.

<p>What makes more sense is to stay home if you feel sick. Masks should be a rare sight in public since if you're feeling well you should have the ability to recover at home.</p>

        <p>In NATO countries we somehow managed since covid to convince the normies that there's no difference between being sick and not being sick.</p>
<p>Which is actually the worst idea ever to fight an epidemics because then people are not going to take special measures when they are actually contagious, either they will rely on mask magic to protect others and go on with their day or they will just be so fed up after a year of hell that they will overcompensate by not giving a damn anymore. </p>
<p>How hard was it to convince people to take measures like masking, self isolation and work for home... <em>when they are sick</em>. You know, generally good ideas that should always have been common sense no matter what virus is currently trending.</p>

        <p>Ironically, this means widespread masking could actually make the problem <em>worse</em>! </p>
<p>The absolute number one thing you can do during a pandemic is to stay home if you are actively sick (Cold, flu, covid, whatever- symptoms are indistinguishable). </p>
<p>But if you have absolutely no symptoms whatsoever? Available metadata show that there is only a 0.7% chance of transmission (attack rate) among household members. That number skyrockets to above 30% if you have symptoms.</p>

        <p>A lot of outbreaks in old folk care institutions were caused by staff hiding their symptoms not to get in trouble or having to lose a week's wage or 'wasting' their sick days on what felt like a simple cold.</p>
<p>Middle managers are complicit because they do not want to have to find a replacement at the last minute and do not care what happens tomorrow.</p>
<p>-&rt; My point is it's way easier to hide your symptoms when everyone is masked.</p>
<p>I am not blaming the staff even though many do deserve blame for indirectly causing the death of vulnerable people under their care to avoid administrative issues. I am advocating for general workplace culture reforms to make it easy, costless and expected for sick employees to stay home to protect the rest. You know there's no way our anti working class elites would go for this.</p>

        <p>It’s 0.7% for asymptomatic transmission. <em>Pre-symptomatic</em> is higher. </p>
<p>&rt; He et al.1 showed that SARS-CoV-2 viral load was highest on the day of symptom onset (day 0) and declined thereafter.
We estimated that 44% (95% confidence interval, 30–57%) of secondary cases were infected during the index cases’ presymptomatic stage.</p>

        <p>Probably because the powers that be don’t want paid sick leave to apply in service sector jobs.  Internationally paid sick leave is more of a thing in the service sector so there is more acceptance of letting people be exempt from masks or use a face shield instead as an alternative.  If people were getting paid sick leave in the US the masks issue would probably be less intense.</p>

        <p>Paid sick leave isn't a problem for "the powers that be." It's a problem for the ones signing the paychecks. That person has work to be done, has hired employees to perform that work in return for money, and when one wants to be paid for no work, the business owner "loses."</p>
<p>Smart employers know that humans get sick. They also recognize that employees that have to decide between getting their full paycheck and recovering from illness often choose the money, which means the illness comes to work with them. Smart employees choose employers that give them paid sick time, even if their hourly or salaried pay rate is lower than employers that don't offer that benefit.</p>

        <p>Admittedly I haven't been to China in about 10 years, but I <em>have</em> been there a handful of times and I don't remember seeing people wearing a mask.  Oh, maybe now and then, but not that you'd notice.</p>

        <p>&rt;    in the 1950s, Japan’s rapid post-World War II industrialization led to rampant air pollution and booming growth of the pollen-rich Japanese cedar, which flourished due to rising ambient levels of carbon dioxide. Mask-wearing went from seasonal affectation to year-round habit. Today, Japanese consumers buy $230 million in surgical masks a year, and neighboring countries facing chronic pollution issues—most notably China and Korea—have also adopted the practice.</p>

        <p>Must be old footage. I live in central Tokyo and virtually everyone is wearing masks.  Not defending or advocating for masks, but since March, it’s rare to see someone without a mask. </p>
<p>I was out in the suburbs yesterday with my wife and there were more people not wearing masks, including her father, so perhaps you saw some footage from outside the city.</p>

        <p>Surprisingly No! This one is from August. There’s a decent amount of people wearing masks, but a large proportion are wearing incorrectly with noses exposed, and I’d say around 1/6 of people have no mask on at all (would never ever see that in a shopping center around here. . Overall, mask compliance seems substantially lower in Tokyo than around me. Granted I’m comparing winter in Ohio to Japan in summer/fall. </p>

        <p>So the Shibuya one, everyone I saw scrubbing through the video is wearing a mask. I live up the street a couple of km and everyone wears a mask in Shibuya. The Kabukicho video is an exception. Kabukicho is the red light district of Tokyo and the exception and not the rule.  It’s basically shut down at the moment (since early January). </p>
<p>The difference in Japan is that there isn’t really “mask shaming” or any of this nonsense going on the states. People are allowed to pull their masks down while walking around without a fear of some dipshit yelling at them to pull their mask up. A lot of people do pull their mask below their nose sometimes and nobody cares. But there is definitely compliance with wearing masks here. People in Japan typically “follow the rules” so if the governer asks everyone to wear a mask in public, 99.9 percent of the population will just do it. The culture here is different than in western society - conformity and group mentality over individual mentality is how it is.</p>

        <p>I lived in Japan for 5 years and they absolutely wear masks when they aren't sick. Women will wear them to work if they didn't feel like doing all of their makeup. If you are at a nail salon and are sneezing and coughing they will offer you a mask.</p>

        <p>A lot of post-Enlightenment ideologies transferred what would be religious devotion to the state. Atheists and secularists are immersed in post-Enlightenment ideology and don't have anything protecting them from that. Most also don't routinely read books old enough to make them aware that it <em>is</em> a trend (e.g. 1 Samuel and Judges). Talking about the Bronze Age having the exact same issue gives Christians a very long view of history. It's why we're predicting disaster constantly: we're right about the predictors, but don't know our own sense of scale.</p>

        <p>Spanish Flu mask mandate actually lasted \~2 years afaik. But the Science of the time did go from "masks are saving half the population" to "masks are being completely useless" in less than 2 years. Of course they didn't just "change opinion". Instead, they claimed they were being useless only because the people weren't wearing masks the proper way.</p>

        <p>It's hard to deny the similarities between how masks are nowadays being worn, and how religious garments (veil, turbans, crucifixes, etc...) are being worn and especially <em>displayed</em> for others to see.</p>
<p>And in both cases, the more the wearer virtue signals with symbols, the more they tend to be a sinner to their own rules, like people publishing masked selfies just not following isolation rules in private and having poor general hygiene in public places, touching everything, coughing at each other, so on.</p>

        <p>Masks don't prevent the virus. It makes you laugh that the box tells the truth? They don't prevent the virus and no one who knows what they're talking about have ever said that they are a 100% catch all to prevent it. They aid in the prevention of transmission of airborne and particulate carried illnesses. If the mask stops 25% of particulates coming from my mouth and 25% of particulates from your mouth and we social distance, the odds of exchanging any kind of illness have been exponentially decreased. Not reduced to 0 (hence the disclaimer on the side of the box), decreased. </p>

        <p>At first, Lord Fauci said not to worry about face masks. Then some holy epiphany happened and now they’re recommended or required. For what, a virus with a 99.99999% survival rate for 99% of the population?? My guess? Masks help slow the spread of the real virus, public discourse. A public that critically thinks, questions things, and discusses using logic is the biggest danger to power. Masks, aka muzzles, discourage people from speaking in public. They see others with masks on and they assume they’re doing the right thing, doing their part. If face masks were never REQUIRED, this “pandemic” would have ended by May. </p>
<p>As a human capable of taking care of MY health, assessing MY risks, I don’t need someone or some entity requiring me to act “fOr ThE hEaLtH oF oThErS.” I’m good on wearing a mask/muzzle, not for me. ✌️</p>

        <p>This ‘muzzle’ narrative is so pointless. You know the internet exists right? The biggest and easiest way to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>This isn’t la resistance with underground communities of free thinkers suddenly unable to communicate because of a cotton mask.</p>
<p>You only need to look to the BLM protests or Storm the Capitol to see large groups of people still able to organise and mobilise, despite the mask mandate. </p>
<p>The sad reality is your selfish stance on the whole issue. It’s all about you, how you feel, your health, your risks, despite how it affects other people. Like it or not this virus is real and transmitted almost exclusively via droplets from your mouth, so yeah masks will help that but not solve it.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Having your own critical thought process is SELFISH.</p>
<p>I see no example of critical through in the person I replied too's post, or yours for that matter. They think public discourse is what the government consider the "real virus". Public discourse on what exactly? What's the "muzzle" trying to stop? They don't elaborate.</p>
<p>It's all baseless conspiracy theories that don't lead anywhere.</p>
<p>I can tell you this for certain, the UK government (who I didn't vote for) would like nothing more than for "normality" to return, so they can continue their policies that make the wealthy wealthier, and hurt the most impoverished areas of our society. The pandemic massively affects this, and is a reason why the UK's numbers for the virus are so high compared to Europe because they refused to implement appropriate measures for the sake of a stronger economy. </p>
<p>So it's not in their best interest to "control" the population, or "muzzle" them. They'd much prefer their usual methods of right-wing press targeting the poor and the opposition and throwing out the usual crowd-pleasing policies to placate most of the electorate. That's the real "conspiracy" here...</p>

<p>In light of this study, why <em>do</em> surgeons wear masks?</p>
<p>Either way, I wasn't talking about surgery rooms. I was talking about an alternative use for surgical masks. It's not conspiracy theory, unless you believe guantanamo bay doesn't exist?</p>

        <p>Oh my you must be having me on... You send me some research paper from 30 years ago and it even says:</p>
<p>&rt;Masks may be used to protect the operating team from drops of infected blood and from airborne infections, but have not been proven to protect the patient operated by a <strong>healthy operating team.</strong></p>
<p>It literally concludes if they're healthy they're less likely to infect people. I think many people could tell you that.</p>
<p>The mask mandate is down to mainly asymptomatic people spreading it. It's a precaution not a solution.</p>
<p>And my point was not that Guantanamo Bay is a conspiracy theory, nor is the fact they make people wear masks in there – I have no idea where you think I said that – maybe you need to critically think more about what I say and your responses... It was about the leap of logic, the similarity of one thing acts as a reason for another. The only similarity in the two examples are masks, but you can't draw parallels between all things that have something in common.</p>
<p>And my other point was about how your echo chamber feeds your conspiracy mindset. For whatever reason you have a mistrust of the government or some form of power, it could stem from childhood, or some significant event, and this mind set means you bypass logical thought to draw concludes that aren't there to satisfy your mind set. </p>
<p>I think I'm done on this subject now. I'm fighting against the tide in a sub that's dedicated to the exact opposite of what I'm arguing.</p>

        <p>The true insanity is that nothing has changed since then, AND the people at the WHO know that face masks are useless, but they recommend them anyway:</p>
<p>"At present there is only limited and inconsistent scientific
evidence to support the effectiveness of masking of healthy
people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory
viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (75). A large randomized
community-based trial in which 4862 healthy participants
were divided into a group wearing medical/surgical masks
and a control group found no difference in infection with
SARS-CoV-2 (76)."</p>

        <p>I think face masks (especially cloth or non-medical ones) are more or less to get people comfortable going out and doing things who otherwise wouldn't feel comfortable at all. Medical grade N-95 masks are too expensive and just not feasible to have on hand but they would work better than cloth masks.</p>

        <p>I've been saying this since last April. I've stood by my beliefs and been a man of my word, too. Lost 3 jobs last year, and have been unemployed (without unemployment benefits) for 3 months now. But at least I'll have a clean conscience when this is through, and I'll be able to tell the younger generation that I never acquiesced to this BS, and didn't play a part in perpetuating it.

        <p>I imagine a big part of it is psychological. There is so much talk about masks that people get the idea that they are some sort of magic immunity device. People love to say that they wear them because they want to look out for others, but lets face it, most people probably just care about trying to protect their own asses.</p>

        <p>Masks very slightly reduce your likelihood of giving someone else something that you have. If you've ever seen someone wearing a mask in the cold where you can see the moisture on their breath it isn't all that much, but it at least slows the particulate so if you're suck it's better than nothing for protecting others from what you have.</p>
<p>That said, if we stop exposing ourselves to germs, our immune systems will become weaker and eventually the smallest of things will be deadly. It's the same thing that caused the explosion in quantity and severity of peanut allergies.</p>

        <p>Which is exactly why social distancing is also important, you have arrived at the correct conclusion, sure skeptics show that blowing through the mask can put out a match less than an inch from their face, but how do think that breath gets to another person wearing a mask a safe distance away? And why is it always compliance, and how compliance is this dangerous thing that exposes the vulnerability of people, is obeying the laws outside of Covid bad because you’re complying with the rules set by your government? I doubt you have a criminal record, does that mean that your compliant to the governments demands, even the small things, like parking tickets?</p>

        <p>Long story short, I had a stem cell transplant so I had a very specialized doctor. Really knows his stuff. At the time I had a low immune system from medicine I was taking so my body didn't try to fight the new stem cells. </p>
<p>Well, I bought a couple masks and I always forget what they're called, but kind of like custom masks. I show up to an appointment and my doctor more or less tells me that it's not going to do anything for me. Like, masks at all won't. This was a few years ago and I was a little shocked, but whatever.</p>
<p>It works to some extent just because it is a barrier in front of your mouth, but it's not 100% foolproof. Maybe not even 50%. I know they say your mask is to protect others, but even in that scenario it's still not some miracle fabric.</p>

        <p>Its probably because everyone is touching and re-using the masks. Proper sanitary protocol is required for masks to be effective.</p>

<p>To me they seem like a disease-magnet if not removed with rubber gloves and disposed of after every use, and then same done with the gloves.</p>

        <p>I used to always wonder how residents of China used to cope with wearing masks year round.  Now I see that they probably don't like it at all.  I got used to wearing one (struggled in the beginning), and it's truly crappy.  Even if you get used to it physically, it really does get on your nerves after a while.  Plus it muffles my speech as I'm not a really loud person to begin with.</p>

        <p>Mask wearing is for people who are already sick, to prevent spreading illness to others if they absolutely must be around them. It does virtually nothing to protect you from getting sick, unless it’s an N95 or something similar. This is why there’s no point to healthy...excuse me, <em>asymptomatic</em>...people wearing them.</p>

My point is, he's an experienced medic and at the start of the pandemic he said "I don't see how masks are gonna help at all,these masks were made to stop larger germs, they don't even stop them completely, they're basically for when you perform surgery." and when I speak against masks people call me uneducated and borderline a stupid science denier.

        <p>The mask itself isn't the reason people "haven't gotten sick this year." It's a combination of face covering, less physical contact, less crowding, staying out of indoor areas, going to fewer places, fewer people working outside the home, and fewer (and sometimes no) gatherings and events. If you eliminate all but face coverings (in other words, if life goes back to normal but everyone wears a mask), everyone would get just as sick as they did before 2020.</p>

        <p>It really depends on where your are in the US (if you are in the US).... Outside of a few circumstances while working, I don’t really wear them where I live outside of the grocery store... people are still sane here. </p>
<p>I mean...does it make sense to wear one while driving alone or riding a bicycle around your favorite loop...alone? Come on... </p>
<p>To be completely honest, I only wear one in public indoor spaces like the grocery store to avoid some crazy, self-righteous, paranoid weekend warrior that feels they need to prove themselves or get some weird personal satisfaction on social media via some 1:29 sec video clip that’s fits in some left wing sub.</p>

        <p>...and thats the ignorant philosophy that got us to millions of cases. If its mild for you, fine. But for gods sake wear a mask or practice social distancing - just because its mild for *you* doesnt mean that you cannot infect elderly people. Please</p>

The Luciferian pedophiles running the show use them in Satanic Ritual Abuse and are inflicting a ritual form of abuse on us nationwide? It's a way for our China-bought-and-paid-for politicians to funnel money to China by forcing 330 million Americans to buy a steady stream of masks mostly made in China?</p>

        <p>There are unfortunately some logical problems with this argument.</p>
<p>First is your premise that mask use has only recently been suggested. </p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7169241/</p>
<p>That's a 2010 study that suggests mask wearing would have considerable effect on lowering transmission of influenza. </p>
<p>Then there's other evidence - they're standard issue in medical settings where respitory infection is a risk. Doctors and surgeons have used them for decade.</p>
<p>They were key in preventing the spread of the first Sars.</p>
<p>Then there's just the basic science. If flu is spread in water droplets and masks block water droplets, then...</p>
<p>I understand you hate them. And you hate being told what to do. But surely you hate this lockdown shit even more than wearing a mask! If we all just wear masks we can get this shit done quicker.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure the point of mask is to prevent the spread of Covid. I believe N95 mask can actually help prevent you from getting it. However, the whole point it so stop you from giving it to someone else. If everyone where's the mask the spread of covid is reduced.</p>

        <p>Here is how masks work, the air you breath out has germs, right? So, when you wear a mask it HELPS to stop the germs from spreading to someone else, which is why you also say 6ft away to eliminate the possibility for OTHER people to get sick if you are sick. THE MASK DOES NOT PROTECT YOU FROM OTHER PEOPLE, which is why you both wear it. The reason you wear a mask for covid is because you dont start to experience symptoms until 3 days after exposure. Flu and cold you experience symptoms more often.</p>

        <p>&rt;that said wearing a mask would probably not prevent you from getting flu or colds.</p>
<p>I don't think this was ever claimed by studies. The claim is that you wearing a mask reduces the chance of you transmissing a virus to others because dropplets don't spray around as much, that's pretty much it. If you are the only one wearing a mask within a group of sick people, it won't help. It's also no guarantee, it just reduces the risk somewhat. If governments claimed that masks are 100% effective, there would be no need to lockdown and people could simply wear masks for a while until the virus is gone.</p>

<p>No this also applies to talking, you don't just spread droplets when sneazing or coughing:</p>

<p>Why are you trying to lay words into my mouth? When have I ever implied that I don't know the difference between coughing and breathing normally? You also realize that one state can quickly change into the other, right? You can breathe normally one minute and cough the next minute.</p>

<p>"To visualise droplets and aerosols, UNSW researchers used LED lighting system &amp; a high-speed camera, filming people coughing and sneezing in different scenarios — using no mask, 2 different types of cloth masks, and a surgical mask.

        <p>There's so much wrong with your comment!</p>
<p>I could post a study proving that asymptomatic spread was not statistically greater than zero percent, but you would respond that the scientists faked their research- oh wait!  I have and every one of you doomers stated that very thing.  I could post a quote from Dr. Fauci where he said that masks are pointless and that people without symptoms should never wear them, but.... you all insist that he was high or something that day- or just telling lies.   I could post studies over the last ONE HUNDRED YEARS even by Dr. Fauci himself that state that masks don't slow or stop the spread of respiratory diseases and you would call ALL of those studies fake.</p>
<p>So... why in the hell should I take you seriously?</p>
<p>Besides, if what you say is true and people are constantly spewing garden hose worthy streams of water out of their mouths every second, the masks would be soaked through and you'd be constantly growing bacteria of the worst sort on all of your masks that would then be thrust into your pockets only to be worn again.</p>
<p>That would lead to massive respiratory infections that would progress into pneumonia.   Enjoy your slow death.</p>
<p>The 1918 flu outbreak didn't kill 650,000 Americans.  Most of that number died of respiratory infections.  Most likely because of the constant mask use.  It was called Bacterial Pneumonia.   Yes, you can get pneumonia from things OTHER than viruses.</p>

        <p>I will repeat what is literally the only point I was trying to make in my comment: You spread droplets by coughing, sneazing and even just talking. Apparently, that is such a controversial thing that you continue to lay all kinds of words into my mouth.</p>

<p>That's an interesting discussion tactic. Simply assume that your opponant has all kinds of wacky views and debate those. </p>
<p>I will be very clear now: I have never made any kind of claim about any asymtomatic spread. I have never claimed scientists fake anything. I have never made any comment on Dr. Fauci. </p>
<p>So tell me, why should I take you seriously if you just make up claims about what I believe without any reason?</p>
<p>&rt;Besides, if what you say is true and people are constantly spewing garden hose worthy streams of water out of their mouths every second, the masks would be soaked through and you'd be constantly growing bacteria of the worst sort on all of your masks that would then be thrust into your pockets only to be worn again.</p>
<p>You just can't help yourself, can you? Both of us know excactly that I have never claimed that "people are constantly spewing garden hose worthy streams of water out of their mouths every second". Why are you acting as if I have claimed that? Can you make one comment without creating an absurd caricature that you reply to?</p>
<p>&rt;Enjoy your slow death.</p>
<p>That's not very nice, I hope you stay healthy, even if you don't wear a mask. And I really hope you aren't as angry as you seem in the comment, that's very bad for your health.</p>

        <p>&rt;If you're never making claims that masks need to be worn by healthy people who are asymptomatic then why the hell are you arguing with me?</p>
<p>You know you can go back and read my comments, right? You claimed that "Wearing a mask only works if you are coughing and sneezing." and accused me of not knowing the difference between "coughing and someone who is simply breathing normally". I am repeating myself again, but I replied that just talking is enough to spread droplets and putting something in front of your mouth reduces that. After that, you got angry and accused me of having all kinds of crazy beliefs for no reason.</p>
<p>&rt;If no one needs to wear a mask UNLESS ACTIVELY SICK, then why the fuck are you claiming otherwise?</p>
<p>I never claimed otherwise, I even pointed out that I don't care if you wear a mask or not.</p>
<p>&rt;Yes, you did.</p>
<p>Then tell me where.</p>
<p>&rt;You linked the study about talking which was 100% about asymptomatic people spreading the virus through talking.</p>
<p>I linked to a study that had the aim to visualize the spread of droplets when speaking. I can quote the headline if you want:</p>
<p><em>"For the first time, researchers have directly visualized how speaking produces and expels droplets of saliva into the air."</em></p>
<p>After all, you didn't believe me when I linked a video from an university that tried to do the same thing "because it has creepy music" and because "you have travelled the world and never seen anyone spit on you like in the video".</p>
<p>&rt;Stop lying.</p>
<p>No u.</p>

        <p>So.... you didn't read the study?  Or you're just backpedaling away from it?  Or both?</p>
<p>The study was 100% about asymptomatic people.  You linked it.  So either you didn't read it and posted the first thing you found, or you did read it, but you're now pretending to not support it?  You linked it.  It's up to you to support it, not me.   </p>
<p>Asymptomatic people do not spread respiratory viruses.   If you believe that, then your stance is that the study you linked is bullshit.   If you believe that asymptomatic people DO spread the virus, then you're making the claim that asymptomatic people need to wear masks.</p>
<p>So did you post a bullshit study that should be discredited?</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>

        <p>&rt;So.... you didn't read the study?</p>
<p>Are you talking about the article I linked? Or this study that the article is based on? Or do you not know the difference?</p>
<p>&rt;Or you're just backpedaling away from it?</p>
<p>All I'm doing is repeating the fact that my original response was about the fact that saliva spreads by talking. You are the one who is trying reeeeealy hard to shift away from this by accusing me of all kinds of things..</p>
<p>&rt;The study was 100% about asymptomatic people.</p>
<p>The study was about visualizing saliva droplets while talking. That's what the study is about. Yes, scientists did the study to study potential asymptomatic spread. So what? The claim that <em>I</em> have made is that saliva droplets are spread by talking and the study clearly shows that. Sympthomatic people can also talk, right? In other words, this applies to everyone, people with COVID, people with COVID and without symphtoms and people without COVID. Everyone spreads saliva around by simply talking. I know that this fact somehow upsets you, but it's simply a fact.</p>
<p>&rt;You linked it. It's up to you to support it, not me. </p>
<p>I have no interest in discussing/defending every word of an article I have linked. I have made my claim clear 1000 times, and I will make it clear one more time just because: My claim is that saliva droplets are spread just by talking. The article confirms that. That's it. Do you finally want to admit that? Yes or no?</p>
<p>&rt;then you're making the claim that asymptomatic people need to wear masks.</p>
<p>This is so pathatic, why are you still lying? I have never claimed asymptomatic people need to wear masks. STOP LAYING WORDS INTO MY MOUTH.</p>
<p>&rt;So did you post a bullshit study that should be discredited?</p>
<p>I'm not a fucking scientist dude, I have never studied this topic, so how can I say wether this study can be dicredited or not? Call me naive, but when there are people who's whole job it is to study stuff, I'm going ahead and assume they aren't deliberately lying about anything they write.</p>

<p>Both.  They both do it.  They both speak ONLY about asymptomatic spread through speaking.  Both.</p>

<p>My claim is that only symptomatic people spread respiratory disease.   That's all.  ONLY.  That means people who are sick and coughing and sneezing and spitting and have fevers- SICK people!</p>
<p>I don't give a shit about discussing the 50 million ways sick people can spit into someone else's mouth.  I DON'T CARE</p>
<p>All I care about- the only point I care about is that sick people spit covid- healthy people do not.  Only those who are OBVIOUSLY sick spit covid. </p>
<p>I'm done.  I completely disagree the talking article and study because they speak only on healthy people spitting covid.</p>

<p>So you are still not sure if spit leaves your mouth when you talk? Is this supposed to be some kind of troll or something that like that? Or are you honestly still trying to move the goalpost? Or is lying just the natural way you communicate? Look, I would go over the article with you, but it's pretty clear you are only interested in this weird behavior.</p>
<p>&rt;Do you really not know what was in the very article you yourself linked as proof?</p>
<p>No, never heard of it. Let's take a look at what it's about by reading the title /s:</p>
<p>"How exactly do we spread droplets as we talk? Engineers found out." </p>
<p>Interesting, I wonder what it is about, such a mysteric and secretive title. Let's read the summary:</p>
<p>"Princeton’s Howard Stone and CNRS’s Manouk Abkarian have directly visualized how speech and breath produce and expel droplets of saliva into the air." </p>
<p>"For the first time, researchers have directly visualized how speaking produces and expels droplets of saliva into the air. The smallest droplets can be inhaled by other people and are a primary way that respiratory infections like COVID-19 spread from person to person."</p>
<p>So confusing, those scientists sure talk gibberish, I have no idea what they are saying. /s</p>
<p>&rt;I have made one overall claim this entire time and you have done nothing but argue while pretending NOT to disagree with me-</p>
<p>Hey look, another lie. Let's take a look at a few of the claimes you have made:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Wearing a mask only works if you are coughing and sneezing."</li>
<li>"If you can’t tell the difference between someone who is coughing and someone who is simply breathing normally, then seriously there is no hope for you in society."</li>
<li>"I have NEVER had someone spit on me like the people are doing in this terrible video of yours."</li>
<li>"you all insist that he was high or something that day- or just telling lies."</li>
<li>"you would call ALL of those studies fake."</li>
</ol>
<p>And so on..</p>
<p>&rt;I don't give a shit about discussing the 50 million ways sick people can spit into someone else's mouth. I DON'T CARE</p>
<p>Then why are you spending so much time trying to pick a fight with me? I can of course remind you for the 100th time that this started because you got triggered at this comment:</p>
<p>You: "Wearing a mask only works if you are coughing and sneezing." 
Me: "No this also applies to talking, you don't just spread droplets when sneazing or coughing."</p>
<p>&rt;My claim is that only symptomatic people spread respiratory disease. That's all. ONLY. That means people who are sick and coughing and sneezing and spitting and have fevers- SICK people!</p>
<p>What? What an amazing idea, you need to let the scientists know of your groundbreaking theory/s</p>
<p>Symptoms aren't universal. Not everyone has a cough, not everyone has it fever. Some are just tired, some have pain in their throat, some can no longer taste. The other way around you can also have a cough without having covid. And you can be sick and have symptoms without realizing or actively hiding you have covid. </p>
<p>&rt;I'm done. I completely disagree the talking article and study because they speak only on healthy people spitting covid.</p>
<p>Why? Because only healthy people can talk? Or sick people don't spread saliva droplets when talking?</p>

        <p>Masks have been used for a long time against germs in the medical field, the reason they didn’t bring them in the public is because they felt it wasn’t worth it, it was wrong of them to do so in 2013, not the other way around, but letting people die from the flu was already normalized at this time so why bother with masks, right ? 
On the other side, you may have a strong system, but that prevents you from getting sick, not from transporting it, the mask will avoid that the viruses you transport go to people with weaker immunity systems. 
If you are sick, you will most likely not be forced to come with a mask since working from home is getting more accepted.</p>

        <p>Take a look at some photos from the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. People enforce masks and stay at home policies back then as well.
Actually the stay at home policies go way back to the black death and cholera in European cities in the 14-1700s</p>

        <p>Because it became politically convenient and necessary for them to be so. Up until March 2020, the scientific and medical community was nearly split on the usage of masks to prevent infection from airborne illnesses/disease. (The standard guidance was that you only wear it if you’re sick, not if you are trying not to get sick) Our lord and savior Dr Fauci said numerous times that it wasn’t necessary to wear a mask leading up to when they decided it was necessary to do so. </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is, like you said, we have not up until this point lived in a society that was socially and politically accepting of masks being worn as part of normal daily life. Now it is, even though I’m sure the science has not changed, we are just dealing with a new virus that we are learning how to deal with. </p>
<p>The good news is, luckily we live in an age where modern medicine is so advanced we can develop a vaccine and therapeutics for a new deadly virus in under a year and distribute it to millions of people daily. </p>
<p>The bad news is that people are so riddled with fear, anxiety and stress from the consistent doom spreading from media and politicians that they don’t have an idea how to adapt and free themselves from the hell that has been created and exacerbated by social media and people who have platforms to bitch about it.</p>
<p>The physical effects of the virus is and will be taken care of. The mental effects were ignored and pushed to the side, and they will live in for years and years to come, but rest assured, there is going to be a time where you’re not going to be called a murderer for not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Masks have been in use for a lot time. There was even a study to see if a surgeon needs to wear extra protection to stop any fart particles setting out and it was determined the driving was enough as is. </p>
<p>Mask wearing in surgery has been since the late 1890s. This is to stop people around them from getting unwell.</p>

        <p>&rt;I dunno surgeons have been using them for years...</p>
<p>They have, but I'm not sure why exactly. They don't seem to do much:</p>
<p>&rt;After 1,537 operations performed with face masks, 73 (4.7%) wound infections were recorded and, after 1,551 operations performed without face masks, 55 (3.5%) infections occurred. This difference was not statistically significant (<strong><em>p</em></strong>\&rt; 0.05) and the bacterial species cultured from the wound infections did not differ in any way, which would have supported the fact that the numerical difference was a statistically “missed” difference.</p>

<p>Try thinking critically a bit, if you can. I posted a peer-reviewed scientific journal article showing the mask plays no role in preventing <strong>pathogen</strong> infection of wounds post-operation, so clearly I believe in pathogens if that is the metric I am using to measure the efficacy of masks. Do you understand how that works?</p>

        <p>the logic behind it remains the same. that particular virus travel via droplets produced through coughs and sneezes. masking up will limit the droplets. just look at countries that masked up. New Zealand, Taiwan, Singapore. of course I'm not saying that masking up is all they do but it definitely helps a lot.</p>

        <p>And masks catching droplets makes it perfect for bacteria to grow, leading to bacteria being breathed in, maybe causing bacterial pneumonia which then gets misdiagnosed as Covid pneumonia so antibiotics aren’t prescribed. You can see what the problem is here.</p>

        <p>yup. elimination of assumptions. there are one off masks. there's also washing of masks. you're going down a slippery slope (fallacy).</p>
<p>as it is, i don't see much articles about what you're describing happening. to get a diagnosed of covid you'd first need to do a test. "misdiagnosis" just doesnt happen at that scale. EVEN if it does the tradeoff would be worth the calculated risk. do you see new Zealand or taiwan's citizens died of misdiagnosis or "bacterial" pneumonia ?</p>

        <p>There is a reason. I think that we can all agree in germs being microscopic little parts flying around in our air when exhaled by an infected person. Based on that, running them through a small enough filter would minimize the risk of getting infected, as many of the germs would get stuck in said filter - basically, masks are just filters on steroids (and no mind controlling devices). I will probably get downvoted to hell for this but I just wanted to make things clear.</p>

        <p>I have no problems with masks say in a very crowded place or like at a concert. But like at a grocery store with 3 ppl in it and you’re far away and avoid them? It’s some people that ruin it for the rest yknow. But taking into consideration those who are medically compromised to respiratory issues and COVID is important. If I get it I will have a not fun time most likely.</p>

        <p>Says someone who has most likely never been to Japan. I’ve lived there, mask wearing is not as prevalent as you make it out to be. Do they when they are actively sick with symptoms? Yes. Is it so common you see more wearing masks than not? Absolutely no. It’s still a far far fewer percentage overall that you’ll see wearing a mask on any given day.</p>

        <p>If you actually researched it, you would see they only had mandates for about a month. The NYC Philharmonic was open nearly the whole time. We didn't shut down society for all of two years. And no, people didn't keep wearing masks for 100 years because it might keep them from getting a cold. Watch who you call a moron.</p>

        <p>If you actually did your research you would know that the mandate only lasted a month until the numbers <em>miraculously</em> went down. Then when they went back up, they had another one that lasted much longer until the numbers went down. And I wasn’t saying we’ve been wearing masks for 100 years. I was saying the last time we had a pandemic we wore masks 100 years ago</p>

        <p>Because people are unfortunately getting tired of quarantining just like 100 years ago. In the summer many people hung out outside because they thought it was much safer then. Now I’m guessing it’s just because people are more and more getting tired of this lifestyle</p>

        <p>I don’t know why you’re helping my point. You’re right, most people required them indoors, not in outdoor summer gathering like I’m saying. Which is exactly why they went up. No masks outside at gatherings which primarily happened in the summer when it was hot. And I don’t know where you live but masks have been widespread since May for me</p>

        <p>I'm not sure that I'm helping your point. I'm trying to understand why you think face coverings are the main (or only) factor in transmission of the virus. Where I live, mid-summer was when we had a legal mandate put in place and that has not changed since then. I have seen no significant change in pattern. The vast majority of people in public have their face covered. </p>
<p>Yet we've seen numbers go down, up, down, up and now down again.</p>

        <p>They did not mandate masks for the entire population. Only in hotspots. And only for a couple months.</p>
<p>They had not yet developed a clear theory of viruses, much less isolated them, and had yet to realize how amazingly tiny they are. Their masks did nothing.</p>
