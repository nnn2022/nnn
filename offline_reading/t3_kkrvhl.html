        <p>Yeah me too.  This has a lot to do with politics yes but it's much bigger and much more concerning than that and I don't even visit or keep up with as much politics as I used to which I'm sure is one of the intended consequences of this scamdemic.</p>

        <p>When the virus first came to the UK I thought shit this is bad. Supported the first lockdown, then got furloughed in May. Had two months with nothing to do, a friend sent me a link to a podcast by computing forever, it woke me up! Been digging down the rabbit hole ever since. The amount of lies and contradictions are unreal. How I never saw it before I don't know. How other people still can't or won't see it is beyond me. A quick search in the interweb is all it takes to get started.</p>
<p>My immediate family think I'm a bit obsessed but they are coming round.</p>
<p>Mother in law caught convid after she had a flu jab (She's deemed high risk and is still shielding) was I'll for a few days but OK now.</p>
<p>I've told my kids if they try and force them to have the vaccine at school, walk out and call me, I'll go round there and stab em in the heart with the vaccine!</p>
<p>You can shove your poison vaccine up your arse!</p>

        <p>When I was a kid, I used to show the hypocrisy in religion and the people in my bubble would think I was a nut crazy guy questioning what wasn't supposed to be questioned.</p>
<p>Now as an adult, when I show the hypocrisy in the "covid science", the people in my bubble think I am a nut crazy guy questioning what wasn't supposed to be questioned.</p>
<p>It looks like people didn't change. They just changed their sides. At least here I can find some good memes and remember that there's still people questioning everything around there. :)</p>

        <p>I’ve been suspicious the entire time. It’s such a nice thing to separate who I am vs who they are. The philosophy of lockdowns and masking vs personal freedoms to take your chances. Any idiot can ascertain the hypocrisy. Shut down small business vs swarms at wal mart. Democratic street parties thinking Biden won.  No social distancing and several with no mask </p>
<p>You go to the store and see most wearing masks with a few with no masks. You can summarize who voted for Biden and who has common sense. Were these obeyers planted? I can’t logically get behind the mask culture. If I touch things with bare hands before a masker scans my products with their bare hands. How are the safe from products. Trust the science? Nope. It’s trust their science, because overwhelming science says these fraudsters are only believing their science.</p>

        <p>Autism kept me from forming faith in society.  Conscription (the fancy word for government battle slavery) destroyed my faith in government.  Phimosis (well, the always-suggested treatments) destroyed my faith in the medical establishment.  Why <em>wouldn't</em> I be here?</p>

        <p>I was in jail when this all hit. It became absolute hysteria in there. The news was reporting the death rate at 3-4%. I knew if that were true, martial law would come soon.</p>
<p>I got out of jail. The city I lived in had become a ghost town. It was very eerie. It was like I'd transitioned into a slightly larger jail, with the added bonus of access to pussy. So it was still better, but it wasn't the free world I'd remembered. </p>
<p>I'd been heavily into conspiracy theories years prior, but had backed off on researching them because of the way it affected my mental health.</p>
<p>The potentialities of what was happening fell into place pretty quickly for me. The response to the virus was insane, and global. How did we all get on the same page about this one thing all of a sudden? Then I noticed that every single measure did one or both of 2 things: centralize power, diminish individual liberty.</p>
<p>I saw the writing on the wall. It was glowing. Still is.</p>

        <p>When covid first came out, I was terrified. I’m talking; first one in my small town of 800 people to wear a mask, disinfecting my groceries, not seeing friends and family-allllllladat. </p>
<p>Now, I think it’s all bullshit. What red-pilled me was the fact that the media started claiming the local hospital was over run and patients were being triaged in their cars in the parking lot. </p>
<p>Right after that news aired, someone posted a video doing a walk through of this supposed overflowing parking lot and hospital....empty. Ghost town. Nobody. No cars. </p>
<p>That really opened my eyes to what’s going on around us. Shits fucked.</p>
