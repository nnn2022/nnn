    <strong>Ever notice how lockdown cheerleaders have all their terminology/catch phrases literally backwards?</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li><strong>Skeptics are "sheep"</strong>: when did <em>non</em>-conformists become sheep?  A "sheep", in the derogatory sense, follows the herd and does not apply critical thought to the "why" aspect.  Which is exactly what the #staythefuckathome #wearafuckingmask #6fuckingfeetapart crowd are doing.  Skeptics are the ones defying the groupthink.  Not sheep.</li>
</ul>
<p>-<strong>Skeptics are "conspiracy theorists" and "science deniers"</strong>: Not really.  Skeptics analyze raw data (number of cases, percent positive, daily deaths, etc) and react accordingly.  Lockdowners say "don't trust the CDC, they've been infiltrated by Trump and are spreading misinformation to help Trump steal the election."  That doesn't sound like a conspiracy theory or science denial to you?</p>
<p><strong>"Thanks to skeptics, this is going to drag on for [x amount of time]"</strong>: Remember how the mitigation efforts were first sold to us?  They said that the hospital system was at risk of being overwhelmed, and so we had to <em>slow</em> the spread.  That would supposedly <em>prolong</em> the total amount of time from beginning to end, but in doing so, keep the total hospitalization number at any given time at a lower level.  If everybody were a skeptic and we did nothing to slow or control the spread, we would get it all over with more quickly, not more slowly.</p>
<p><strong>Skeptics are "Karens"</strong>: First of all, "Karen" as a derogatory term has always been total bullshit.  How many perfectly lovely people named "Karen" have become the butt-end of jokes and memes because of this stupid fucking trend?  Anyway, "Karen" in the colloquial sense refers to somebody who is entitled and demands that authority figures placate their whining about what they think other people can and can't do.  So, by that definition, who is a "Karen", the person walking around the grocery store without a mask minding their own damn business, or the person who goes crying to the manager and calling the police, demanding that they remove the non-masker, and maybe even going so far as to physically drag the non-masker out of the store themselves?  </p>
<p><strong>"Skeptics are selfish, they don't care about other people</strong>.  Couldn't be further from the truth.  We care about people's ability to make a living, to enjoy their lives, to see family, to have friendships, romantic and intimate relationships.  We care about people who run small businesses that cannot survive an extended lockdown.  We care about mental health and well-being.  We care about people who have had suicidal thoughts, who have turned to substance abuse, who have become physically unhealthy, because of the lockdowns.  We want to help them (the first step to helping them is rescinding the tyrannical lockdowns).  Doomers don't care about "other people", all they care about is the virus and trying to cancel/publicly shame people who don't believe in the same things they believe in.  And remind me again how it's <em>not</em> "selfish" to expect the entire world to come to a grinding halt, to cater to <em>your</em> germaphobic, paranoid delusions about getting sick and dying?  If <em>you</em> are that concerned about getting sick, isolate <em>yourself</em>.  Crying that 7 billion other people should jump through hoops and have their lives ruined just to cater to your whims is not caring about other people.  Telling 7 billion other people that you don't trust their risk assessment skills, and they must strip themselves of their agency to make decisions because you know best, is the very definition of selfish.</p>
<p>These people contradict themselves around every turn.  It's a miracle that they're still able to take themselves seriously.  In a couple years when we all realize we were duped and the public opinion shifts, I wonder if they'll be ashamed of themselves for buying into the hype so blindly.</p></p>

<p>Bold of you to assume they have shame to begin with.</p>
<p>Also "conspiracy theorist" was always a propaganda term to shut down people who started poking around and asking too-pertinent questions about underhanded dealings in the world of politics. Granted, there is genuine batshit stuff that falls under the umbrella of "conspiracy theories" but that's very much the point, so that the legitimate stuff gets lumped in with lizard people and the like and TPTB breathe a collective sigh of relief.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about this. I'm really not. I know a lot of <em>optimists</em> on here are hoping the "bad guys" will be exposed, and history will write this off as hysteria and a product of incompetence, but I have my doubts on this. I don't think justice will be served, based on the current goings-ons. I predict they will write this as having been just as bad or worse than the 1918 spanish flu, and that any changes made to society from this were justified, and necessary. </p>
<p>Oh, and this topic has been discussed many times on here. It's projection. They accuse dissidents of being awful things in order to further villify them, in order to get more compliance from the populace that is more docile and susceptible. It's working since many people are now actively attacking people without masks or questioning the narrative. It's by design.</p>

<p>I mean, here's the thing, not that I'd give my information to anyone regarding my health that isn't a healthcare professional (for legal reasons, honestly: they don't have the capacity, training or the motivation to keep it all confidential), but seeing as how it is healthcare information, FOIA can still allow its release?</p>

        <p>Yeah unfortunately this is going to be hard to prove to pro-lockdown people that they were wrong. You already see it: any time numbers get worse, it’s proof that we’re being bad citizens and not following the rules, but when numbers get better it’s because we social pressured people enough into doing the right thing^TM . It’s an unprovable premise but also unfalsifiable because we have no way of knowing how many people are/aren’t following the rules at any given time or what would’ve happened if we’d reacted differently to the disease overall.</p>
<p>Our best bet is that hopefully future historians can look at these events with a more objective lens and realize that we got so wrapped up in misplaced fear that we unnecessarily completely altered our society.</p>

        <p>The people who are still passionately pro-lockdown at this point are obviously not going to be convinced by data, so in that sense, you're right that it can never be disproved to them. But they clearly <em>can</em> be persuaded (easily) by emotional media narratives and social pressure. So while their minds won't be changed by more evidence, when the public mood shifts against it, they will suddenly discover that they were against it all along.

        <p>And “not doing our part.” Sorry if I don’t care about the distant relative of the grocery store cashier who I see once a week for the few minutes they ring up my groceries. </p>

        <p>The thing is, if they're concerned about their distant relative, THEY can mitigate that on their own. But they want everyone else to do it for them. They'd rather everyone around them lock down halfway, rather than they choose to lock down full-on individually and leave everyone else alone.</p>
<p>It's a "misery loves company" scenario. Without getting too partisan, it also literally just occurred to me that there may also be some aspect of "social equity" thought process at play here, which might explain the relative strength of lockdown support from the far left. Granted, such people are missing how much more harmful all this is to the disadvantaged, but this is a case where they're thinking about themselves over others.</p>

        <p>Especially considering that so many of us have had our lives smashed by this, while society and media around us are callously indifferent and even insult us for being pissed about it. Then they're mad at us for taking the remaining opportunities to feel joy in life, because theoretically some asthmatic down a chain of infection out there might get sick and we don't care enough?

        <p>This one pisses me off the most because at least some of the other claims at least come from looking at biased statistics or assessing risk differently. This claim makes no sense no matter how terrible you think the virus is. We knew from the start that the goal of the safety measures was precisely to drag this out. It was explicitly stated as the alternative was that everyone got the virus at once. Then they all just suddenly pulled a 180 on that about ~3 weeks ago and now we’re being told that by going out we’re similtaneoisly exposing too many people to the virus and making it take longer to get herd immunity, somehow.</p>

        <p>Humans have always inadvertently infected each other with pathogenic viruses. It comes with the territory of coexisting with viruses on the planet. </p>
<p>Unless a person is being grossly negligent (like being out and about when obviously sick or sneezing in my face), I would absolutely not consider it an attack if I catch covid from that person. If I am especially worried about catching the virus, I can take extra steps to protect myself. It’s not a 100% guarantee, but that’s life.</p>
<p>This new “morality” of considering each individual responsible for everyone else’s health is unworkable. It means we cannot step out unless there is zero chance of infecting someone, which is never.</p>

        <p>No. I could catch Covid anytime, and yesterday’s test doesn’t guarantee I am free of Covid today. Every time I leave the house I could be an inadvertent transmission vector, unless I get tested each time I step out. It’s absurd to expect this of people, not to mention unworkable.</p>

        <p>They're not all real people. There are a few categories...</p>
<p>1) Real people that are misguided / terminally propagandized</p>
<p>2) Bots</p>
<p>3) Paid shills - state actors, intelligence agencies</p>
<p>And then on top of that you have the ever increasing algorithmic content manipulation and censorship employed by corporate which controls 99% of the flow of information between Google, FB, Twitter (reddit is <em>not</em> an exception to the rule).</p>
<p>So some of them definitely are real people but it's getting harder to tell (see things like GPT3, just that we're allowed to know of), eventually it'll be nearly impossible to distinguish (maybe we're already at that point?). What proportion are genuinely real people that hold such beliefs? it's hard to say but it's obvious there is an interest in exaggerating the perception of that number to get everyone else to play along. most people will go along if they think it's the majority opinion.</p>

<p>Say for example standing outside someones home in the middle of the night with a guillotine and bullhorn and flashlights, and screaming for them to wake up and take up your cause because if they don’t they are fascists.  </p>

        <p>Welcome to Orwell meets Idiocracy...everything means something else in this dystopian hellhole. They are a lunatic religious cult masquerading as the intelligent, educated, enlightened ones who "follow the science" and are doing all this dumb shit because they "care about others".  Ignorance is strength. Freedom is slavery. Everything about this whole thing is completely nonsensical, backwards, and absurd.</p>

        <p>As others have said, this sort of self-deception is called Doublethink, which Orwell laid out very nicely in 1984.</p>
<p><em>"If one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality. For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one's own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes."</em></p>

        <p>I’ve been saying that third one so much and feel like I’m going crazy. Everyone I talked to in March-April agreed that the measures we were taking were extending the amount of time the virus would be with us but in exchange we don’t get a ton of sick people at once. You can have a curve that’s short in length or height, but you can’t have both.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the last few weeks I’ve seen a ton of people blaming the fact that we’re not over the pandemic by now on reopening too early. You can at least argue it would’ve been better overall to stay locked down for longer, but there is literally no alternate reality where we stayed locked down for longer without extending the length of time the disease is prevalent.</p>

<p>And to think you wasted all that time writing this post just to help yourself feel better, when those of us with a sound mind and logic can feel you shaking in your boots.</p>
<p>You should be scared. You have <em>absolutely</em> no idea what’s going on. You are clamoring to find people who will agree with you, so you feel safe. But really what you’ve done is spent probably over an hour distorting every bit of reality needed to make you feel in control. The irony is, you are not. </p>
