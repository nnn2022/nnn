        <p>thanks, just added more.
Check out the stuff I talk about the pine cone.
The water has got fluoride in it, cause it attack the pineal gland, which is your 'antenna'. If your eye be light, your whole body will be full of light.</p>

        <p>I have a friend who's mostly redpilled and I finally thought he was ready to hear this a couple months ago. I recommended he buy a fluoride filter and bless him, he did. </p>
<p>Thanks for posting this. Obviously, no, it is not OK to poison our water and call it a "health measure".</p>

        <p>good news that he did do that, so take him to the next step. I will be honest and say, dont even bother with those, u can buy aIce River Springs in Canada, its like $4.00 bucks, or any other brand with no 'Fluoride' = 0.00ppm.
If you a bottle of water and it has fluoride, its tap water, straight Up. Its a scam.</p>

        <p><em>LEAD</em></p>
<p><em>-In 2006, scientists from Harvard School of Public Health and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sina</em> </p>
<p><em>identified 5 industrial chemicals responsible for causing harm to the brain - lead, methyl mercury,</em> </p>
<p><em>polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic and toluene. Exposure to these neurotoxins was associated with</em> </p>
<p><em>changes in neutron development in the fetus as well as among infants and with lower school</em> </p>
<p><em>performance, delinquent behaviour, neurological abnormalities and reduced IQ in school aged children.</em> </p>
<p><em>**Now the same researchers have reviewed the literature and included; fluoride.</em> </p>
<p><em>-Adding fluorosilicic acid to drinking water has been reported to increase the accumulation of the neurotoxicant lead in the body (Masters and Coplan 1999; Masters et al. 2000). and being that fluoride is also known to help facilitate lead uptake into our body.</em> </p>
<p><em>This can lead to a direct contamination of</em> <em>drinking water with other heavy metals as well, subsequent contamination of drinking water flowing through piping systems with lead brass or other fixtures by fluoride in conjunction with chloramine.</em> </p>
<p><em>Those with tiny body mass, small liver, small kidneys and developing brain are affected the most.</em> </p>
<p><em>-Fluoride reaction in the water is also known to leach lead from, lead pipes, lead based solders and lead bass brass fittings, usually found in older homes, as well older communities in today’s water distribution systems. it has been claimed that fluoridated drinking water increase human exposure to lead due to lead due to solubilization of lead from drinking water pipes by formation of highly soluble lead complexes. The calaim was based on relationships of drinking water fluoridation and blood lead concentrations observed in case study (coplan et al. 2007)</em></p>
<p><em>-Fluoride is more toxic then lead, just slightly less toxic than arsenic. Fluoride is an acute toxin with a very</em> </p>
<p><em>toxic rating of 4. That is higher than that of lead (3-4) Clinical Toxicology of Commercial Products 1984.</em></p>
<p><em>-It has been claimed that fluoridated drinking water increase human exposure to lead due to solubilization of lead from drinking water pipes by formation of highly soluble lead complexes. The claim was based on relationships of drinking water fluoridation and blood lead concentrations observed in a case study (Copian et al 2007).</em> </p>
<p><em>-In the news on Nov 5 2019, lead in some Canadian water, is worse than Flint, Michigan.U.S.A. In recent tests done in Canadian homes, 33% or one third, of the homes tested exceeded the national safety guideline.</em></p>
<p><em>DENTIST</em></p>
<p><em>-Many dental researchers concede that Fluoride benefits are topical not ingested. (Fejerskov 1981;</em> </p>
<p><em>Carlos1983; CDC 1999, 2001, Lime back 1999, Locker 1999; Featherstone 2000)</em> </p>
<p><em>-In 1950 the US Public Health Service enthusiastically endorsed fluoridation before one single trial had been completed. Unfortunately, because government officials have put so much of their credibility on the line defending fluoridation, it will be very difficult for them to speak honestly and openly about the issue. It is difficult for institutions such as American Dental Association to concede health risks because of the liabilities waiting in the wings if they were to do so.</em></p>
<p><em>-The US Center of Disease Control and Prevention declared that in the second half of the 20th century,</em> </p>
<p><em>the steep decline dental decay in the United States can be attributed to fluoridation. However,</em> </p>
<p><em>antifluoride lobbyists show that a similar decline in dental decay has been observed worldwide</em> </p>
<p><em>in countries that do not fluoridate their drinking water supplies.</em></p>
<p><em>-While the evidence base for the dental effects of topical fluoride use is strong, the risk-benefit associated with systemic</em> </p>
<p><em>exposure to ingested fluorides is a more difficult scenario since excessive systemic ingestion of fluorides.</em></p>
<p><em>-In 2006, FDA announced that bottled water with fluoride levels greater than 0.6 and up to 1.0 mg/L could be labeled with the</em> </p>
<p><em>following statement: “Drinking fluoridated water may reduce the risk of tooth decay.”</em></p>

        <p><em>CHILDREN</em></p>
<p><em>-Eliminating and detoxing from fluoride can be the difference between a baby having an opportunity to grow up with excellent natural health. Fluoride has been linked to reduced intelligence; lower IQ, neurobehavioral defects; leads to autism, add, and other cognitive impairments, hippocampus damage; impaired ability to learn and remember. As little as 1/100 of an ounce of sodium fluoride can kill a 10 pound infant.</em></p>
<p><em>-Children in high fluoride areas, had significantly lower IQ scores than those who lived in low fluoride area. Pregnancy is the most critical period for exposure to fluoride, fetus being most vulnerable to fluoride toxicity. Children ingesting fluoridated water have been found to demonstrate intellectual deficits even at water fluoride levels of 0.09ppm. (Australian surveys)</em> <em>Fluoride water should not be added to infant formula as it exposes infants to nearly 4 times more fluoride.</em> <em>-In 2017, a 12 year long government funded study was completed. It showed significant reductions in</em> <em>children’s IQ, when mothers were exposed to fluoride during pregnancy. Loss of 6 IQ points. This study was published in, The Journal Environmental Health Perspectives in Sept 2017</em></p>
<p><em>-The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends that water with added fluoride, bottled or otherwise,</em> </p>
<p><em>should not be used to mix concentrated formula or foods intended for babies age 1 year and younger to</em> </p>
<p><em>prevent tooth damage.Therefore, there are no benefits, only risks, for infants ingesting this heightened level</em> </p>
<p><em>of fluoride at such an early age.</em></p>
<p><em>-In July 2012, scientist from Harvard University warned that the developing brain may be another target for fluoride toxicity. The Harvard team based their warning on a larger number of studies from China that have found reduced IQ score among children exposed to elevated fluoride during their years of life. Twelve of the studies the Harvard team reviewed found IQ loss at fluoride deemed safe in the U.S.</em></p>
<p><em>-Most scientists believe that small amounts of fluoride in the diet can help prevent dental caries</em> </p>
<p><em>and strengthen bones, but there are a number of adverse affects that chronic ingestion at high doses</em> </p>
<p><em>can have on human health, including dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis, increased rates of bone</em> </p>
<p><em>fractures, decreased birth rates, increased rates of urolithiasis (kidney stones),</em> </p>
<p><em>impaired thyroid function, and lower intelligence in children.</em></p>
<p><em>-In Europe, where the practice of fluoride in the water has almost unanimously been rejected and yet according to statistics collected and published by the World Health Organization (WHO), there is no discernible difference in tooth decay between the minority of developed countries that fluoridate water, and the majority that do not, their children's teeth are just as good, if not better than those of American children.</em></p>
<p><em>-In human studies the fluoridating agents most commonly used in the U.S.A not only increase the uptake of lead into children’s blood but also associated with an increase in violent behaviour. (Masters and Coplan, 1999,2000)</em> </p>
<p><em>-Pregnancy is the most critical period for exposure to fluoride. The fetus and infants are the most vulnerable to fluoride toxicity, due to their small size, infants receive up to 400% more fluoride (per pound of body weight) than adults consuming the same level of fluoride in water. Infants also have an impaired ability to excrete fluoride through their kidneys. Healthy adults can excrete more than 59% of ingested fluoride. Infants by contrast, can only excrete 15-20%. This leads to greater build up of fluoride in the body. A baby’s blood-brain barrier isn’t fully developed allowing fluoride, a neurotoxin, access to the brain.</em></p>

        <p><em>-Several researchers have found a positive correlation between the fluoride concentrations measured in maternal and umbilical cord blood plasma, which suggests that the placenta allows passive diffusion of fluoride from mother to fetus (Gupta et al., 1993)</em></p>
<p><em>-The results of the 2017 study by Bashash et al. included up to 299 pregnant women and their offspring. Fluoride exposure was determined by measuring fluoride in the urine of the pregnant women because that is a reliable measure of total fluoride exposure. The researchers found a correlation between urine fluoride of the pregnant mothers and a loss of up to 6 IQ points in their children, when tested at 4 and again between 6-12 years of age. This study was published in The Journal Environmental Health Perspectives in September 2017.</em></p>
<p><em>-Children in non-fluoridated communities are already getting the so-called “optimal” doses from other sources (Heller et al, 1997) In fact, many are already being over-exposed to fluoride and causing changes to the child’s neurobehavioral development.</em></p>
<p><em>-Human studies have shown that fluoride is transferred across the placenta, and there is a direct relationship between fluoride levels in maternal and core blood. Fluoride is poorly transferred into human breastmilk, but still occurs.</em> </p>
<p><em>-Dental fluorosis which is caused by to much fluoride exposure is not only a cosmetic defect, It can have a psychological impact</em> </p>
<p><em>on the child has been established by the US National Institute of Mental Health. A study found</em> </p>
<p><em>that children with severe dental fluorosis are more likely to be perceived by their peers</em> </p>
<p><em>as less intelligent, less attractive, less social, less happy, less careful, less hygienic,</em> </p>
<p><em>and less reliable – characteristics which could have major effects on a child's self-esteem.</em></p>
<p><em>-A study conducted by the UCLA school of public health uncovered that women with higher levels of PFC’s in their blood</em> </p>
<p><em>had a much harder time getting pregnant than those with lower levels.</em></p>
<p><em>-Concerns about the ‘wisdom’ of supplementing an infant’s diet with fluoride are being voiced by even pro-fluoride dental organizations. In 1994, the American Academy of Paediatrics (ADA) American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Paediatric Dentistry (AAPD) reversed their decades-long policy of recommending that doctors prescribe fluoride supplements to newborn infants.</em></p>
<p><em>-“Fluoride supplements not recommended for children under 3”</em></p>
<p><em>The Journal of the Canadian Dental Association.</em></p>
<p><em>-Most current calls to poison control centres for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride containing toothpaste. Disease control and prevention recommend supervising children below 6 brushing their teeth, so that they don’t swallow toothpaste. Toothpaste is an extremely potent source of fluoride containing anywhere from 1000 ppm to 1500 ppm.</em></p>
<p><em>-With the advent of fluoridated tooth pastes in the 1950’s and 1960’s, pharmaceutical grade sodium fluoride came on the market. Crest tubes said “Caution children under 6 should not use Crest” (Contact poison control on side of toothpaste).</em></p>
<p><em>-Children drinking water fluoridated with silicofluorides are at increased risk of having elevated blood lead levels.</em></p>
<p><em>-Children can have perfectly good teeth with out being exposed to fluoride. While another 53 published studies reporting association of fluoride exposure with a lowering IQ in children, and over 200 animal-fluoride studies reporting damage to the brain and reduced learning and memory ability.</em></p>
<p><em>-If fluoride was necessary for strong teeth, one would expect to find it in breast milk, but the level there is 0.01ppm, which is 100 times less than the fluoridated tap water (IOM 1997)</em></p>
<p><em>-Fluoride can damage the brain and impact learning and behaviour. Between 30 and 50% of childrenhave dental fluorosis on at least 2 teeth in optimally fluoridated communities.</em></p>
<p><em>-Fluoride toxicity can lead to renal damage in children. Researchers studied 210</em> <em>children living in areas of China with varying levels of fluoride in water (0.61–5.69 ppm). Among this group,</em> </p>
<p><em>the children drinking water with more than 2 ppm fluoride – particularly those with dental fluorosis – were found to</em> <em>have increased levels of NAG and y-GT in their urine, both of which are markers of kidney damage. The children's</em> <em>urine also contains increased levels of lactic dehydrogenase – a possible indicator of liver damage. A diseased</em> </p>
<p><em>kidney is unable to effectively excrete fluoride, so individuals with compromised kidneys are at risk of developing fluorosis even</em> <em>at normal recommended limit of 0.7–1.2 ppm.</em></p>
<p><em>-Studies have shown an association between the use of fluorosilicic acid and its sodium salt to fluoridate water and</em> <em>increased uptake of lead into children's blood. Lead is acknowledged as a neurotoxin that damages the child's</em> <em>developing brain, and lead toxicity is unaddressed especially in developing countries. Sodium fluoride is an</em> <em>extremely toxic substance, just 200 mg of fluoride ion is enough to kill a young child, and just 3–5 g (e.g., a teaspoon)</em> <em>is enough to kill an adult.</em></p>
