    <strong>I think I've heard it all now. Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health suggests that people wear masks INSIDE THEIR HOMES</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;The suggestion came after reports of the recent spike in coronavirus  cases being linked to infections at home and among family members. It  was announced during a press conference held by Dr Kiattipoom  Wongrachit, the permanent secretary of the ministry.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Around 74 per  cent of the latest infections in Bangkok and its surrounding regions  have been from family members, inside community clusters and in office  spaces, according to the latest data from the ministry’s Department of  Disease Control (DDC). <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“<strong>Therefore, we ask for cooperation from  those who have to go outside for work or other activities, to come home  and immediately change into new clothes, shower, wear masks at all  times, social distance, and refrain from eating together for the time  being</strong>,” said Dr Kiattipoom.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“Office employees are also discouraged  from eating together, and should refrain from talking to one another  without wearing a mask.”</p>

<p>And i thought our "Experts" in Germany are crazy.</p>

        <p>Its not clown enough for me personally. When the day comes that adults will be wearing nappies to stop the spread of covid through farting then I think it might just be clown enough.</p>

        <p>I'm in the Philippines. A couple of months ago there were signs up all over my local area, as well as in my condo, telling us all that we should all wear masks at home as well unless we lived alone.</p>
<p>They were up for about two weeks before being removed. I guess they realised that they couldn't enforce it. Even if they bothered going door to door to check, everybody could have put masks on before opening their door.</p>
