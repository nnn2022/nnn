    <strong>Why "Non-Essential" Workers Exist</strong>
    <p><p>Since the beginning of the so called "pandemic" the working class has been divided into two classes by the government, essential and non-essential. The non-essentials have not been allowed to work, have lost their businesses, and gone into major debt. So what is the purpose of seperating the working class you ask?, why put millions out of work with no support?. These non-essential workers are fully capable of working and will most likely take any work they can when offered. </p>
<p>The truth in history points out the purpose of "non-essential" workers in times of great crisis. The non-essentail workers will be the first hand picked drafted soldiers of WWIII. Ever since last year we have been getting closer and closer to the next world war, and now we are on the very brink of nuclear with Russia, and law makers recognizing China's Uigher genicide as it is. Everyone forced to stay home with no work will be sent military drafts. Governments created the system to form their army big enough to be able to comabt with some of the most largest and deadly armies in the world.</p>
<p>Some may argue that millitary drafts no longer exist, or are illegal. Since the beginning if the "pandemic" the governments have stripped almost all civil and human rights from their people completely throwing out the founding laws, values and constitutions from existance. All powers and authorities have been handed over to lawyers and un-elected health buerocracies, allowing them to make any law they want without passing a bill or having elected government votes. They have been able to put the entire world on house arrest, so what is stopping them from sending everyone to war?</p></p>

        <p>Interesting point. The phrase ‘non-essential’ is utterly wrong. Every business is essential to those who earn their living from it. More lies from the government.</p>

        <p>The phrase "non-essentail" is a degrading insult. Its the government telling the people that they are not important contributors to society, and are not needed. It's part of the demoralization of the nation.</p>

        <p>I disagree with your conclusions. It's just a way to divide the nation, increase poverty and dependency on government grants. You might have a point if you say that these people, after a little brainwashing and now receiving paychecks from daddy government, will now fight to defend their status quo and the leviathan.</p>

        <p>I agree that it was meant to devide and make people depend on the governent for survival. It's also the perfect way to push the Marxist adgenda to eliminate the middle class. Marxism is pathway that leads to communism.</p>

        <p>Holy shit. Are you seriously suggesting the entire covid-19 pandemic was fabricated in order to draft people for WWIII?</p>
<p>Is this real or satire?</p>
