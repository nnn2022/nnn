    <strong>Does people really mask their babies? How damn cruel is that..</strong>
    <p><p>That's so bad and unhealthy for the kid. How could people comply that much? If the baby suffocates, it cant even let you know. Its a baby! It's terribly risky. If I had a child, I would never mask, to hell with old people. If they say something, then they should die at some corner, don't care. I am not against old people but if they want to mask my child, forget it. They lived their lives anyway, nor old people nor government has right to block its right to have oxygen.</p></p>

        <p>It is advised to not even have light cloth covers as babies can accidentally kick it over their face and suffocate.</p>
<p>It's called SIDS.</p>
<p>Yet somehow, putting a mask on a baby is "perfectly safe".</p>
<p>Anyone who reads history knows humans went through moments of mass hysteria and did weird shit.</p>
<p>This is one of those times.</p>

        <p>The media over hyped this thing to the point that, a majority of people are making decisions irrationally. </p>
<p>More than once in my life, I fell victim to my own self inflicted hysteria and made shitty decisions. Humans are not always calm, collected and thinking logical and pragmaticly.</p>
<p>I guess the craziness gets amplified when its the whole city/state/country/hemisphere/globe that has succumbed to hysteria.</p>

<p>I can't stop him from eating the sand in a playground How the fuck am I going to keep a mask on his face especially with his sensory differences? It is extraordinarily cruel. I hate what these fucking people are doing to us.</p>

        <p>Yiiikes. Yo thats upsetting that people cant let the kid have air without acting all fearful.</p>
<p>This was all by design to social engineer and for power , 100%. This has been more of an attack on the youth while putting the "useless eaters" to death in retirement homes. Really unfortunate how divided we were designed to be. Screaming at eachother in grocery stores while big daddy " bill" lowers the population and unfolds the blatant planetary domination. Its getting emotionally draining because im a very empathic person . It makes my heart  feel so heavy seeing a kid with parental guidance masked up for fear of air</p>

        <p>Mass hysterias are weird. I'm thinking we're living through an equivalent to the Ghost Dance, a bizarre religious movement in the 1890s when many of the Plains Indians became convinced that they could bring the buffalo back and force the White Man off North America by dancing, including recorded cases where they attempted to fight off soldiers from the US government by dancing. This kind of insanity tends to pop in societies in crisis, and usually lasts until reality decisively intervenes (with, in the case of the Ghost Dance, Wounded Knee Massacre).</p>

        <p>But here's the thing: Those people were facing an existential crisis. A literal apocalypse as far as they were concerned. It's the same thing I point out about Germany in the 20s or Russia in the late 10s, not to the extreme as with the Sioux et al, but still pretty bad.</p>
<p>But in 2019, in the "developed" world, especially the USA, Canada, and Western Europe, we were/are living in probably the most secure, prosperous, decadent societies in human history. How the everloving fuck did we as societies dive headlong into such mass hysteria and bootlicking without blinking an eye? It can't be just the Mockingbird propaganda, because that had been there for decades on several different fronts.</p>

        <p>Every society structures itself around certain core narratives it uses to make sense of the world, and since the end of World War II ours has been "progress", which will, it is claimed, bring about happiness and prosperity for everyone. People believe it, genuinely, truly believe it, and it functions as a surrogate religion for millions. The future is heaven, and the past hell; and for several decades it worked very well as a way to make sense of the world. 1955 was better for most people in the West than 1945, and 1965 was better still. While there have been some gains, in many ways Progress as an unmitigated good stopped a long time ago, but it still fills a major emotional need for millions.</p>
<p>Infinite progress is no more possible than perpetual motion, and long before it becomes impossible it starts to become a net negative, because of the law of diminishing returns. A very large number of our problems relate to the attempts to push the gains of the mid 20th century to the point of absurdity. I'll use the example of the medical industry: antibiotics are great, early vaccines are amazing and eliminating smallpox, polio, and other diseases dramatically improved public health. Every new discovery costs more benefits fewer people, and has more side effects, because all the easy, truly important, and very safe medicines have already been discovered. What's left is either dangerous, irrelevant to most people, and/or incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>We need to go back to 2016, and realize that Clinton established herself as a candidate to keep going forwards, and Trump as a nostalgic candidate. "Make America Great Again." Trump won, and the everyone lost it, because Trump is explicitly saying that the past was good, and that we can and should try to bring things back from it. The cognitive dissonance of his victory in 2016 has lead to massive disruptions to the psyches of millions, and this pressure needed an outlet. (This is why Trump is such a polarizing figure: he's taken a stance that means anyone who believes in progress, which is to say most of the West, cannot think clearly about him. I suspect this was intentional on his part.)</p>
<p>When there was a slight uptick in death rates because of a bad flu mixed with health care systems starved of necessary resources and corrupted by pharmaceutical companies, things got worse. The mythology of Progress says an uptick in death rates cannot happen, because everything must get better always. Mixed with Trump clearly demonstrating that for millions going back to the past was preferable than the future, all hell broke loose as people found themselves face to face with the fact that their heaven, a shiny Star Trek Future where everything is perfect, which they need to believe in because their lives in the here and now are so miserable, is not there, and never was.</p>
<p>This is why they're losing it: they've just found out that the thing which makes their life tolerable is impossible, and are having a complete mental breakdown.</p>

        <p>Powerful stuff. And you're probably right about the motive behind leaping headlong into tyranny from abundance too.</p>
<p>Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, "progress" was an ersatz article of religious faith, that science and technology would allow us to not only not die but, "be like God, knowing good and evil," exactly as the serpent falsely promised Eve. And people did truly believe it too. Just look at the untold tens of millions slaughtered by communist regimes in the name of "progress."</p>
<p>I never exactly considered what would happen when that came crashing down for millions of people, even when I was critical of it and had been for years.</p>

        <p>I really hope I'm wrong, but I expect there will be a major reckoning over the next few years as it really sinks in that progress is dead. If I'm right, then the Covid crisis is going to look mild compared to what's coming, but on the bright side, an awful lot of extremely constructive possibilities lie on the other side of admitting that "Progress" is over.</p>
<p>As for your comment on the serpent and Eve, did you ever read Oswald Spengler's Decline of the West? He makes the point that each society's "Rationalism" is the theology of their older days with the serial numbers filed off, and you can see that very clearly with the twin myths of Progress and Apocalypse and the Medieval Christian debates over Post or Pre-Milenarianism.</p>
