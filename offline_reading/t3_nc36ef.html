    <strong>"Vaccine created spike proteins are safe due to pre-designed anchor" seems nonsense.</strong>
    <p><p>As we now know the spike protein plays major role in the disease. There are cells in the body that are very vulnerable to the spike protein, like the lining of blood vessels. </p>
<p>Vaccines instruct cells to produce that spike protein. Now the claim is that vaccine created spike protein is actually wholly safe due to "an anchor" (that prevents the spike protein from leaving the cell that produced it) and that only the spike protein created by the virus is the bad guy.</p>
<p>Why I think this anchor claim is a lie? The claim of "anchor" only surfaced after it was shown the spike proteins play major role in the disease. No one knew spike protein was harmful when the vaccine was designed. In any context any sort of post-amendments to claims how things work smell like BS is you ask me. The fact we are seeing large numbers of blocked micro veins in vaccinated people, suggest also the "anchor" claim is not true or the anchor does not function as expected.</p>
<p>If the anchor exists, then it  permanently anchors the created proteins to the cell that made them, if so this will ruin the membrane functionality, harm, and/or kill the cell. Producing more spike proteins when they have no way to leave will, bloat/kill/explode the cell. If that is not the case, the immune system will nevertheless destroy the cell, since the surface of the cell has permanently anchored spike proteins, that mark the cell as "infected" to the immune system, that will then destroy the "infected" cell.</p>
<p>We also know the mRNA ends up everywhere in the body but the liver, not just the muscle tissue around the injection. So vaccinated people will have all sorts of cells with the mRNA, and producing the spike protein, and if it anchors to a cell, it also marks that cell for destruction. Autoimmune nightmare if you ask me, when your own body kills for example non-regenerating nerve cells.</p>
<p>Either way lot of damage done by the vaccines, the mechanism is open to debate.</p>

        <p>&rt;it also marks that cell for destruction.</p>
<p>This is the most likely outcome. I believe that's why we are seeing a much worse safety profile than traditional vaccines. Many docs also believe that the clots are from platelets interacting with spike presenting epithelial cells in the blood vessels.</p>

        <p>I read the excuses about the spike proteins and none of it made sense. If the spike proteins of Covid, create havoc in the body, I don't want any damn spike proteins in my body from the "covid" vaccines either. I think this is why the side effects are so bad from these Covid vaccines.</p>

        <p>Proteins created by cells leave the cell and perform functions in other cell of the bodys. That's how all inter-cell collaboration work, and that enables colonies of specialized cells to form organisms like the human body.</p>
<p>Now they claim the proteins resulting from being vaccinated do not leave the cell. And it smells of emergency lie.</p>

        <p>Right so if the spike protein is transcribed into the dna then all the cells would produce it again when they replicate. Why does it matter if it goes between cells if itâ€™s already in all the cells?</p>

        <p>It's not clear to me how long the mRNA survives, but when cells divide the mRNA wouldn't follow as there is only one copy of it and only the DNA duplicates on division. </p>
<p>There are theories that the mRNA might escape the cell and even end up as part of the DNA. If so, then it would continue into new generations of cells.</p>
<p>If the spike can leave, there are cells in the body that are very vulnerable to the spike, like the lining of blood vessels. Spike that can leave cells would create blockages. (Which is what we see in in vaccinated people in large numbers)</p>
