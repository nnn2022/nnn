    <strong>I've seen hundreds of covid patients and...</strong>
    <p><p>Well, I've seen many 90+ yr old men and women with covid and 9 out of 10 simply need a little supportive care...maybe a couple liters of O2, then they go home after a day or 2 and are fine.  I've seen dozens of those in their 80's as well, and again, they almost all do well. I've also seen many younger folks as well and very very few of them go beyond needing a touch of o2 for a day.  BUT, some patients need much more support, including life support and without exception, everybody who gets sick is obese.  This fucking virus loves fat and sugar. So...think about this shit. We are all being almost forced to take an unknown chemical into our veins because of fat fuckers. Hey fat fuckers! I'm sick of this shit. You are and were the pandemic. If this society was healthy, non of this bullshit would have taken place. It really is that simple. So now, we all have to deal with less civil liberty and the prospect of injecting a chemical we don't need and may be harmful because people watch too much tv and eat too much fucking shit. God fucking damn. You stupid fucking trolls. You miss the point and will not even discuss the elephant in the room...Fat fuckers. God fucking damn it. Fuck. Hey, even mild obesity raised your risk for severe infection exponentially. Lose some god damn weight and get off our fucking backs. Go for a fucking walk. Turn off the tv and stop getting hammered by shit food advertising. Stop listening to the propaganda that has made you fat as fuck. God fucking damn. Fuck</p></p>

        <p>Because they don't want people healthy - they want to make money. That's why they never started any physical health initiative, never told people to take vitamin D, and butchered the HCQ study by excluding zinc - which is what makes HCQ work - all so they can make money both on pharmaceutical sales and by shifting money away from local business to international conglomerates they own equity in. These are the greediest mother fuckers on the planet my friend.</p>

        <p>Only said to wear masks but never peeped a word on mask hygiene. The vitamin D thing should have definitely been pushed HARD. It's simple and cheap. They wanted the numbers up. They didn't want to protect people. I don't know how anyone can come to any other conclusion.</p>

        <p>Hmm there was all kinds of articles published saying to take vitamin D and Fauci suggested it in all kinds of interviews. Zinc too. Just looked it up, that all for sure happened before fall last year. I agree about big pharma just wanting to make money but get your facts straight.</p>

        <p>Fauci and the CDC and WHO experts have specifically avoided and shit on Zinc, Vitamin D, Ivermectin, and Hydroxychloroquine. (Because ALL of it was recommended over and over by Trump and America's Frontline Doctors.) Don't gaslight us. All of which when used in combination therapy help immensely and even when used individually have shown to increase survival rates by 5-15% depending on the study, but again in combination have a much much higher rate of helping boost survival rates.</p>

        <p>While I agree with you, those of us who ended up gaining some weight happened to suffer from very intense and deep depression because of this lockdown shit, which, as a lot of people know, can be extremely difficult to counteract. So, I see what you’re saying, 100%. I kept my vitamins C, D, magnesium, and zinc at optimal levels all winter while I was sucked into a dark mental hole, and emotionally eating junk food. People, especially those under the crushing weight of depression who were/are unable to move, also need to know about vitamins that can lower their risks. I got moving again after 4 solid months of being totally idle. Not everyone can. Not everyone has the tools or support to be able to pick themselves up. So, please, please be mindful of those people who were severely mentally impacted by the whole fucking mess because we are out here. And it sucks.</p>

        <p>I hear you and when I am taking care of patients, I respect and love each person as an individual, but sometimes the hard and blunt truth needs to be shouted. It really is just 100% apparent that obesity and diabetes are the major co-morbidities, next to alzheimers. The govt, big pharma and big food are one entity and they literally make us unhealthy on purpose. They confuse what it means to eat healthy. Shit, saturated fat is actually good for you, it's the shit in the seed oils (canola, sunflower etc) that are killing us. Eat mostly vegetables, lots of avocado, and just a little grass fed meat...exercise just a little. Avoid packaged foods.  It is that simple. Really is and it isn't that expensive. There is no excuse other than we've all been brainwashed...they've addicted an entire society to junk food and the results are playing out in their plandemic. Sorry if I was offensive. I have nothing against the individual, honestly. I really do just care about people.</p>

        <p>It's hard to break the addiction and that is exactly what it is. Over eating junk foods is no different than smoking cigarettes, only It's harder to quit and more deadly. Good luck to you. Half an Avocado, pile of spinach, half a squeezed lemon, 10 ice cubes, some mint oil or a few mint leaves, 14 drops of liquid Stevia and water to thin into a smoothie. Right there is a serious weight loss smoothie. Ingest only that for 5 days and watch it melt away.  Drink as many as you'd like. You really don't need to vigorously exercise. A couple little walks a day will do the trick. Weight loss is about putting the proper nutrients in your body...much more so than exercise.</p>

        <p>It really just tastes like lemon and mint. You can't taste the spinach at all and the avocado just makes it a bit creamy. I mean, sure, I'd rather eat a pizza followed by a bowl of ice cream but??? It is not bad when you find the right combo. Careful with the mint oils and extracts...start with just a couple drops and go from there. Real mint sprigs are the best. Also, play around by adding a mixture of lime juice with the lemon. It's a perfect weight loss smoothie. It's basically keto as almost all the calories come from the fat in the avocado.  The spinach only has a few calories. You could drink 10 a day and still be close to only 1000 calories and all the calories will be useful for your body. I shit you not, if you ingest only that for a week, you will be amazed. Stay away from carbs.  Eat lots of veges...use balsamic to snazz em up.  My wife makes this "cheese" dip with sweet potatoes, cauliflower and hot sauce (pureed) and my kids think it's actually cheese.  There are ways to eat delicious foods without poisoning yourself.  Good luck</p>

        <p>Also, a good blender makes all the difference. I use a ninja and they're not too spendy and it seriously blends the shit out of it.  Nice and creamy with no leaf texture. My kids drink it and think it's ok.</p>

        <p>Yeah, even just mild obesity raises your risk for severe covid by a lot. I think it's preying on those with metobolic syndromes. Mitochondrial defects and insulin resistance. Get yourself some pulmicort before they release the new 'variants'. Do a nebulizer every few days and do a few after any questionable exposure.</p>

        <p>Shit, where i work, I've been so exposed that I must have immunity. My co workers husband got it and she slept in the same bed, ate meals with him etc...she did not get sick. Other friends of mine have the same story. If you're relatively healthy, covid is a little puss, if it even touches you. The theory that 70% of the population was already immune due to previous coronaviruses is probably true. Christ, and here we are about to have our rights permanently taken if we don't submit to a jab. Wtf. I can't even believe this shit. Am I in the twilight zone.</p>

        <p>It's the only way. The flu vax is completely useless as well. I can't even believe it's a thing. Look at the cochrane review on flu jabs...of all known collected meta data, it has zero effect at reducing fatality. There was one age group of men who displayed a day less symptoms.  That's the best they could come up with. The absolute effectiveness of a flu vax...to prevent one case of flu, at least 77 people need to get vaccinated and we can't even be sure if that's an anomaly.  The flu vax is much more harmful than most know too.  The vax court has paid out more in injury claims for the flu vax than for all others. Here we are, trying to beat a virus with a vaccine again. Damn it all.</p>

        <p>Lol i see the point you're trying to make, and I agree to an extent, but this govt overreach isn't <em>because of</em> fat people, as you stated. That is due to an authoritarian govt and people who agree with authotarianism.</p>

        <p>Well, you are right, but that doesn't negate the fact that almost all the fatalities of those under 70 were obese. I saw one healthy guy die who wasn't obese...72 yr old fella. It was hard to watch.</p>

        <p>Man I get sick of the fat hatred here. Don't you get they fattened up the population with shit food and the plastics, toxins and endocrine disrupters are screwing people up.  I know doctors hate fat people but damn! Probably have the population in America has the cortisol through the damn roof and all the lack of sleep is screwing up their weight. One thing I noticed is all the damn pharmacueticals fatten people up. How come they don't make any shit that takes weight off. I knew a beautiful model, OMG thin to the max, antidepressants fattened her up to 300lbs, she didn't eat more, constant diets, I think she got some weight off but those damn things probably ruined her body for good. Yes I know some people with chemical problems need antidepressants to stay alive and she was one of them but damn why'd they make them like that. Americans need to give up the grease, sugar, and crap processed food.</p>

        <p>That's cool with me. Maybe we agree more than disagree.</p>
<p>This society is screwing up so many people's health. I think of kids even having metabolisms ruined when parents feed them Life cereal, crackers, juice--oh my god may as well call it prediabetes medicine, sugar. I watch TV and sometimes want to puke seeing the wretched stuff they call food. I hate the system and people that make them fat too and keep them that way too. So much food is poison in America. HFC, processed GMO soy, corn etc. They want sick GMO humans to match the horrible food.</p>

        <p>You are right they are poisoning us. Can't wait to get some clean land and start growing my own organic food with a fish pond for breeding. The most insidious are the microplastics and the birth control in the water. Horrible, waste treatment plants don't filter chemicals out. Our men are in a chemical pit they will never have the motivation to get out of.</p>

        <p>I hope you can grow your own food and have clean land. The microplastics are worsening they are finding them everywhere and even somewhere when I was still reading news they were saying adults were eating equivalent to a plastic credit card a year. That's gross. Organic food tastes completely different too. I think birth control is doing stuff and increasing estrogen in water.</p>

        <p>What do you mean? I work in healthcare and we are great at treating emergencies and stabilizing them. If I did get sick with an infection, of course I would seek help, but we must take care of ourselves in the first place. Modern societies are so damn unhealthy and it isn't by accident. If you get sick with covid, the only thing they will use to help you is O2. You have to have a healthy immune system, and if you do, you will likely not even get symptoms. If the cabal had put 1/100th of the lockdown/mask/vaccine effort in to making us more healthy...eating well, life coaches, subsidize healthy food etc, the problem would be solved for now and the future. They don't want that. They want sick sheep to eat cheap food like products.</p>

        <p>No one is saying that fat people shouldn't seek healthcare - everyone should it's their personal responsibility to do so. But shutting down our lives for the decisions they made so that we can protect them? Fuck that noise. You shouldn't be able to stuff your face with cheese burgers and then expect other people to disrupt their lives to save you from the consequences. But that's exactly what happened.</p>

        <p>Given Im obese myself and there have been a few posts who are a bit "fat-shaming" Id just like to add my 2cents.</p>
<p>Im 33 years old and have been overweight ever since I got into school. Im very fit for my shape as despite eating too much garbage, I do exercise. Just not enough. And while I do enjoy too much sugar and fat, I do also eat a lot of healthy stuff.</p>
<p>My health record is basically non-existent. I have something like a bad cold or an ear-infection that knocks me out for a week or two about every 3-4 years. (and those two ear-infections would be easily avoidable if I hadnt rushed after the lake and didnt notice the water left in my ear for a few hours...)</p>
<p>I dont use ANY drugs or supplements. Zero. Not even stuff like skin-creme or sun-creme. Just basic hygiene. And I have perfect skin without any problem.</p>
<p>As far as myself goes, the Number 1 reason I can think off why Im so healthy is, my superior genes. :D Seriously though, I have healthy thoughts. Thats it. Im placeboing myself and it has been working formidable so far. Considering my 3 siblings who are all argueably in better shape but also ill twice a year, Id argue Im on the right track. Should still lose some weight tho.</p>

        <p>During this stupid shit I have quit drinking, lost 70 lbs, down to 15% body fat, and began lifting regularly. Following that I moved to the south and am now getting out daily, enjoying the fresh air and growing some tomatoes and squash on my porch. That's how I have treated this. Seems to be working out just fine. Fuck your mask, and fuck your experimental vaccine.</p>

        <p>Dude your anger is misguided. </p>
<p>Much healthier countries had/has lockdowns still. </p>
<p>This pandemic isnt because of fat people, its because the government literally took the opportunity to grab as much control as they could, so they fudged the numbers. Died from a car accident?? Well actually it was covid. 84 years old already on your deathbed and you start coughing? Seems like covid. Dont forget 40% of the deaths in the US comes from 5 democrat governors shoving covid positive patients back into their nursing homes effectively wiping out the elderly republican votes in their states. </p>
<p>Your blaming the pigs rolling around in the mud for being delicious enticing the wolves to break through the fence instead of the farmer who opened the gate to begin with. The government is to serve the people, not the other way around and they are doing their absolute best to swap that.</p>

        <p>Individuals do have personal responsibility but they werent the ones coming up with the lockdown. From what ive seen in texas and north carolina which is where ive been living during this whole covid thing, over 90% of the people are brainwashed dude. I would be the only maskless person at the grocery store. My own family would wear masks even though they didnt believe in them while we all walked into malls, id be the only maskless. The conditioning is hardcore. People are in auto pilot, they dont actively think. I talk with a lot of people in public, most have no clue why they do even what they do, like going to work for example.  Ive asked people why they are going to work and their answer is “ because thats what your supposed to do” not that its how you provide for yourself, be productive, etc but literally “ i go because i was told”</p>
<p>Technically I am lol. College football offensive line left tackle.</p>

        <p>I am really against taking this tone man... The conceit of so so so much of the propaganda has been to turn common people against each other, and your post seems to be predicated on the notion that the gvts covid policies are justified, and that it's people living lives that make them susceptible to covid that are the problem.</p>
<p>This is precisely the rational motivating vaccine passports. </p>
<p>It's not fat peoples' fault. It's not even covid's "fault". Our rulers are doing this to us, and have been from the start. I certainly resent the true believers who perpetuate the propaganda and show a willingness to turn their neighbors and peers into the regime for dissent, but I don't even blame them and I think it's unwise to - they're just useful idiots.</p>
<p>I mean just look at the propaganda over the past decade, it's all always about divide-and-conquer, and making people want to use the ever-expanding power of the central regime to punish and control the elements of the population they dislike - right v left, black v white, straight v gay, men v women, vaccinated v unvaccinated... </p>
<p>So cut it out. We all know you're right - how covid affects an individual has everything to do with their own health - but people have a natural right to be fat and unhealthy. Just as people have a natural right to refuse pharmaceutical experiments, to make their own risk assesements when it comes to exposing themselves to a pathogen, to do all manner of things that people used to understand were nobody's business but the individual's and anyone they themselves choose to consult. The big lie, and perhaps the most insidious flavor of propaganda there is, is when our rulers convince the population that absolute bodily autonomy is a threat to "public health". It should be pretty obvious by now that this notion is perhaps the most effective way to build a totalitarian hellscape. </p>
<p>Blame the psychopaths with power, not your neighbors who make poor lifestyle choices.</p>

        <p>The funniest part of this post is it’s made by someone who is blaming someone else for his inability to stand up to the govt. They have a point about overweight people and the virus affecting them more but what a coward to say that they have to follow the government’s mandates because of it. Hey cupcake there’s plenty of people that haven’t given their liberties away because that’s what the government has been saying through the TV, internet, or wherever else you are getting your news. By far it is your sheepish compliance to the government’s demands that are responsible for the restrictions you have lost, not someone who likes cheeseburgers more than you. Take some responsibility for your cowardice</p>

        <p>Well there’s something we definitely agree on. It is the cabal, big food and big pharma. It is also a state ran propaganda machine that airs in everyone’s homes 24/7. Couple that with an extremely biased social media platforms that pander to the beta males and SJW females that have never lifted a weight or go into big crowds with their little attitudes because they know they will get their ass handed to them and the picture starts getting a little clearer. What I am saying is that if you are giving away your rights then that is your bad.  Forget about blaming that on someone else. It’s like blaming drunk drivers for you getting caught up in a DUI checkpoint. If you knew how to navigate them better then you won’t be stuck there very long. But more importantly that checkpoint is actually illegal and if everyone got together and started a class action lawsuit they would be forced to stop them. It’s because we as a society let this go on that it happens. We’ve been asleep for too damn long and it’s time we started calling the bad guys by name instead of blaming each other</p>
