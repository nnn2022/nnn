    <strong>My university is requiring the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone, as many of you know pretty much every university in California is requiring the vaccine, including mine. This is clearly ridiculous and politically motivated seeing as Covid is less deadly to young adults than the flu. </p>
<p>As a healthy 18 year old who will not be taking the shot, I decided that rather than lie down and accept my eventual expulsion, I want to fight back. </p>
<p>I am trying to start a grass roots organization of students, faculty, lawyers, and supporters to have our back on a nationwide scale. I want to make our number so large and our voices so loud that the universities have no choice but to abandon this ridiculous mandate. </p>
<p>I know that with a large group of dedicated supporters we can achieve medical freedom for me and my fellow students, many of whom are only taking the shot out of fear of expulsion or segregation. </p>
<p>So I appeal to you, fellow appreciators of liberty and rationality. If any of you are students or faculty at a university requiring the vaccine please reach out to me so that we can organize and make our voices heard. </p>
<p>If you are a lawyer willing to volunteer some time to this cause please reach out.</p>
<p>If you are a medical expert, PHD holder, or anyone else who can lend credibility to our cause please reach out. </p>
<p>And for everyone who just wishes to support the young people being bullied into compliance please follow my newly created Instagram @CSUforMedicalFreedom</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions for strategy, or things I can do to further this cause please offer suggestions in the comments.</p></p>
