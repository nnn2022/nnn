    <strong>I hate when people say "We are in this together"</strong>
    <p><p>No we are not!</p>
<p>*Sorry this is a long read but bare with me it'll be worth it*</p>
<p>If any of us try to voice out against the restrictions we get blasted for it. Try to walk into a store without a mask? Social Media Embarrassment. Try to argue with someone why you don't want to wear a mask? Social Media Embarrassment. Arguing over whether or not vaccines are safe? Social Media Embarrassment.</p>
<p>You try to explain how you really feel about this and you get a few results. First there is that one result in which someone records you and posts it on Twitter, Facebook, etc. Then you get everyone that is following the government blindly after you for how you feel. Calling you things like selfish for just wanting to do something simple like walk into a store without a mask to get milk.</p>
<p>Worried about how masks affect your health in the long run? Oh you're just being selfish there too. People don't care if YOU have a mental health issue involving around the restrictions. People don't care how YOU feel about the pandemic unless it's on the same page as them. Even then you both what say you agree on the same thing and then move on for the day? The thing is people don't care about you because they want to see themselves as the "other people we need to protect". They could be perfectly healthy, but go on a rampage of how you without a mask is making them uncomfortable.</p>
<p>You know what makes me question this whole thing? Is why restrictions first? There wasn't any way they could have tried to control this without "mandating" Covid rules? They couldn't have just "advised" people to keep 6 feet, 3 feet, masked, etc.? Now one could argue that the restrictions were necessary at the beginning because it was so bad. News flash we were "mandated" and the virus apparently still got out of control. Heck a year later most states and counties are still "mandating" the rules and we are "seeing a surge". It almost felt like doing everything from locking down, isolating and wearing masks didn't make any difference since 500,000 plus died from it. What would of happened if we didn't do anything about it? 1,000,000 plus? How do we even know those numbers are legit? Are we supposed to take their word for it? I could get a call from Biden telling me to go on the air tomorrow and say we are up to 600,000 covid deaths and people will buy into that!</p>
<p>The saddest thing is with pretty much everyone following the guidelines they don't stop to think. You ask them if they have done their research and they just give you research the CDC put out that further benefits their own argument. Which the research could be wrong, but if you point it out you are "blind to the truth". Excuse me what "truth"? The "truth" that the lefts have been telling us? All the sudden politicians are truthful now because we are in a pandemic? "Fauci and the CDC are not politicians they are scientists!" Yeah scientists that are being controlled over the government and politicians over what to say to the public.</p>
<p>Then you hear the same annoying phrase "We are in this together". No we are not I mean sure yes we are all "surrounded by Covid" but we are not in this together. Everyone's mental health is different during this. Whether it's been worse, better or the same. People that have NEVER HAD mental health issues are getting them now. People who already HAVE mental health issues is getting worse. "Just go see a therapist". You really think I can trust a professional therapist right now? I don't want a therapist to try to tell me how I need to live with these restrictions. We should be fighting them not submitting to them by means of distractions. Or giving in and facing the fact the restrictions will be a part of our lives now. Nobody wants that to happen, yet according to "experts" people are "too scared to go back to normal". How are we in this together when we literally have two sides of this pandemic. One for normalcy and fun while the other wants restrictions because "you might get the virus" or "you might spread it if you don't comply".</p></p>

        <p>Y'know, a lot of those downsides in your first paragraph end with the phrase "Social Media Embarrassment". You'd have a lot less of that stress if you'd just shut social media itself out of your life and stop worrying what all those brainwashed jerks are posting in their bubbles. Not trying to put you down, I honestly think it'd be better to ditch Facebook and the rest entirely. I haven't touched my account in years, and I only built it to begin with just from simple curiosity.</p>

        <p>I put that out there not really from experience. I've seen it happen a lot on a few subreddits that people have posted pictures of other folks tweets or Facebook posts attacking people for breaking the restrictions. Or for voicing what they want to say about the pandemic.</p>
