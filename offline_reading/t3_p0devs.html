        <p>I work in schools here in CA. They've thrown away food for years. Can't give it to shelters or at food drives for people that the city or some church puts on. It has to be recorded as 'consumed' by students in order to keep the same incoming flow. It can't leave the premises. So in the trash it goes or down the drain if it's milk.</p>
<p>Sort of like cash to schools. Last year without students they still had to use up all the money they were allocated otherwise they'd have less coming in this year. It's the same every year but it was especially awful last year. All new cubicles, all new chairs for all the staff, new printers, copiers. All offices got painted in and out. New awnings where they never needed them. New asphalt in some parking lots. Etc. None of it was needed but the money had to be used.</p>
<p>Isn't government amazing. *vomit* Waste to the extreme.</p>
<p>My grandfather worked in government. Engineer on bases. I remember him saying one year it got close to the end of the fiscal year the base had to spend whatever was left. For the same reason. Gotta show it was needed and used or you get less next year. So his department bought literal truck loads of paint. Just random paint from some supplier. Bought it, had it delivered and unloaded. A crew then dug a pit on the base and then buried it. It has to be shown as 'used' and can't sit in storage in a warehouse.</p>

        <p>In the U.K, big supermarket have only just started giving four away to food banks. People with jobs have to use them in this country as trains and fuel and even water rates are high. The council also has to spend all its money or looses part of it, the following year. Different countries have very similar problems.</p>
