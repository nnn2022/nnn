    <strong>This is how you get through to people (masks/vaccines/etc).</strong>
    <p><p>Probably everyone has had the conversation why masks/vaccines/etc are bad. Unfortunately - if you just try 'telling' them - it can be really hard to get through to them. You need to realize they have been gaslit (i.e., telling them the sky is pink, all their friends say it is pink, their parents say it is pink, therefore it must be pink even though they see it is blue). Now that most have been indoctrinated, even if they want to - it's hard for them to take it off because of habit. (While there are others, who want to - but are afraid/peer pressure). And the AF's ("authority figures", aka "health experts", "doctors", "politicians", etc) - are really trying to attack the credibility of those who are telling the truth. They tend to focus on insignificant or irrelevant items of an argument - or simply try and 'label' someone to totally dismiss the argument (ie.., "you are a CONSPIRACY theorist!").</p>
<p>So this is one way of getting through to regular people/friends/family/etc.</p>
<p>Conversation when talking to them is you have to first LISTEN to THEIR fears/phobias. You need to first find out what their REAL fear is. Some, it is dying. Others, it is peer pressure - they know something is wrong but afraid of sticking their neck out. Others still - they just believe authority figures. If you don't *know* what their true fears are - you might be barking up the wrong tree. I.e., presenting all the evidence in the world wouldn't work if say they "knew" a friend who got it and "died". You'd have to show them the source of this "knowledge" was faulty in this case - i.e., the "doctor" had monetary motivication to declare it "the virus", evidence wouldn't do it.</p>
<p>For most fears/reasons for 'masking'/'vaccines'etc - it boils down to is this:</p>
<p>a) The authority figures SAY masks/vaccines/blah balh are "good", therefore it must be "good". So you need to show how the authority figures are lying/lack credibility. (I.e., making $$$ from mask companies, vaccine companies, etc). Same way "they" like attacking anyone and saying anyone that thinks must be a "conspiracy theorist". You need to show that the AF's are simply greedy lying weasels, which the majority of them are. Make sure you know your facts.</p>
<p>b) 2nd argument tends to be - "well i KNOW a FRIEND/COWORKER/FRIEND OF FRIEND/etc who died". Again - you need to ask them HOW they know. They "know" because thye are TRUSTING an AUTHORITYFIGURE (aka "doctor", "health expert", "professional", etc). So again, you need to point out how many doctors are a combination of getting paid big $$$ to lie/force vaccines/etc. Comes down to credibility. You need to show them that they have misplaced their trust in this AFs. Because most are getting paid BIG $$$ (i.e., $30k PER PATIENT) to say it is "the virus", or money funneled into their various accounts to "help" the "health profession", etc.</p>
<p>c) 3rd argument tends to be well the spouse/friend/etc got the vaccine, or they are a "health worker" and they are "okay". So again - you need to point out - while ppl do die right away from the "cure" - for others, it will take up to 5 years. Point to the FDA document fda dot gov/media/143557/download page #17 (list of diseases they can get), patent #2020-060606. Show them the "bigger play" here - i.e., event201/cyberpolygon/etc. Explain how "they" (the super rich) like mocking/making fun of them - so do so through movies (i.e., the 'songbird' movie), or the deliberate repetition of the #6 (most are satanists/luceiferians, hence the patent 2020-06-06-06, or the mantra of "stay 6 feet away, 6 people or less in your (witch) circle, 6" testing swab", etc, etc...</p>
<p>Those are some of the 'main' arguments. If you can get through to them and make them THINK - then there is a chance they will open their eyes.</p>
<p>Feel free to post any other ideas/common arguments, and I'll update this threat as necessary.</p></p>
