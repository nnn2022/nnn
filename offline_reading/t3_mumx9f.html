        <p>Ok, this is ridiculous. I can understand everyone‚Äôs opinion on the virus and wearing masks, and even the impact on the children over the last years - but Bill Gates? Really? 
He‚Äôs old and tired, already amassed a huge fortune in the 90s and should be retiring on a private island - but instead is putting his money towards solving problems across borders this planet so desperately needs. He‚Äôs done more to solve major issues than anyone else of this generation - eradicated polio for example, or trying to solve sanitation issues (and consequent disease) in Africa, his charity with his wife has done so much!
Now yes capitalism can yield MAJOR douchebags, and oh, they are a plenty, but I‚Äôm sorry - Bill Gates is NOT one of them - I wish I could do for society what he has helped with, but sadly I won‚Äôt be able to with half my net worth of a Big Mac and half drunk soda (and biodegradable straw) :-)</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs funny, Americans harp on about individual success through capitalism, but hate it when someone else makes it there on a huge scale.</p>
<p>You understand how the mechanics of that process occurred right? A company gets bigger and bigger, and especially one that is pushing innovation there aren‚Äôt yet laws or policies about, they of course will come across a instance where it is perceived unfair, anti-trust or anti-competitive. That‚Äôs what the regulatory bodies are in place for, to apply checks and balance</p>
<p>There are plenty of other companies that have been in this situation, but the CEO pockets the funds and DOESN‚ÄôT give back through their charitable efforts (time, money and energy).</p>
<p>He didn‚Äôt steal the money from people, and has done so much good, so yeah - I‚Äôll re-iterate my point - I wish I could do for society for what he has helped with</p>

<p>Americans do like individual success through capitalism. One of the core concepts of capitalism is that there is competition in the market, which is what Microsoft was (and continues even today) actively removing.</p>

        <p>I'm aware of what anti-trust is. <br>
Side question (How is Microsoft actively removing it today out of curiosity? You can install any browser on Android or Windows. You can install apps from multiple sources on Android or Windows. Apple however, their app store and that's it - that is anti-competitive, especially as they take a % of all app and in app purchases).</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Capitalism - at what point does the success of capitalism get stopped by the definition of a free market? My point is as a big company gets not just big, but big enough that the market share is heading towards a monopoly (and there is profit from bundling on/with that monopoly), the arbitrators of a free market (anti-competitive practices) step in - which is totally normal. Fact is there aren't many companies that had that much growth and that much market share of a particular industry to compare against (except the big tech companies, and look how they all handle their own issues, Google, Facebook, Amazon etc). <br>
I don't see how you can say that getting to a point that the arbitrators of a system kicking in is not the pure definition of Capitalist success - they made it, they got that big. The check and balance worked, and everyone moved on. </p>
<p>What would you have done differently?</p>

        <p>If you know about anti-trust laws, then why did you act like there weren't any laws against what Microsoft was doing? It's not like they got "too successful" and then Congress, hands flailing, quickly passed a law that retroactively made Microsoft's monopolistic practices illegal.</p>
<p>For your side question, Microsoft uses a tactic called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">embrace, extend, extinguish</a> to take open standards, add proprietary extensions to those standards, or implement a modified standard based on the open standard, grow their market share, then drop support for the open standard leaving their own products as the only compatible option.</p>
<p>For an example of this, here's an article on <a href="https://clarity.kleydints.com/a-post-mortem-in-5-acts-of-how-microsoft-privatized-open-source-killing-javascript-in-the-process-62ee5fc77d9e">Microsoft's anti-competitive practices regarding Javascript</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;at what point does the success of capitalism get stopped by the definition of a free market? My point is as a big company gets not just big, but big enough that the market share is heading towards a monopoly</p>
<p>You don't grow a company with a market share approaching monopoly without anti-competitive (i.e. anti-capitalist) practices. How do you think Google's Blink browser engine became almost the only one in existence? At one point, Gecko (Firefox) had a dominant market share, but today it's a measly 3-4%. Even Microsoft had to abandon their own browser engine, EdgeHTML, and convert Edge to a Blink browser. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18697824">Here's an account</a> of Google's anti-competitive web design by one of the Edge developers.</p>
<p>As for what I would have done differently, I would have made, or at least done my best to make, a superior product. You can be successful without underhanded tactics, just look at the open source community. Linux is the dominant OS used on servers. This comment you're reading is almost certainly being stored and served to you from a Linux system. Almost every embedded system you see in public is probably running Linux. And there are plenty of companies that make money by developing Linux and providing support to enterprise customers. It's a superior product in direct competition with Microsoft, and the reason that the only computing market where Linux doesn't dominate is consumer PCs is because Bill Gates fought tooth and nail to prevent that from happening in the 90's.</p>

        <p>That's not strictly true - there are broad policies and governing bodies in place to prevent anti-trust and anti-competitive behavior. However we haven't even invented the technology of the next generation of anti-trust law suits. Therefore there will still be grey areas where specific rules/laws have to catch up with behavior around new areas of technology. </p>
<p>To re-iterate these business strategies are only designated anti-trust after the fact (as the court case has to rule it as such), and of course the company will defend their (capitalist) right to carry out that process. The grey areas being pushed by companies is not new, and it really doesn't differentiate them. More importantly how you behave after such a law suit is an indication of morality and future intent. </p>
<p>Its like the age old taxation law problem. If someone gave you a legal way to avoid paying high taxes, would you? It's a grey area, and could save you $1000s, but not illegal. Of course there is a moral component to it, and its annoying to those who pay full tax, but not illegal.  </p>
<p>It's incredibly easy to judge from an arm chair retrospectively (hindsight being 20:20 and all), but at the time, you don't become a global giant without pushing boundaries and utilizing grey areas. That doesn't make it illegal so as long as you comply with the requirements. Especially as I go back to my earlier point, you are spending it on solving real world problems (that you didn't create - for example a tobacco company spending millions on cancer research isn't philanthropical - it's guilt management. However Bill Gates has no other reason to help those less fortunate, than he wants to, and he can, and does a good job of it).</p>

        <p>That‚Äôs quite the reach - ‚Äúevil conspiracies‚Äù.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say for a second he ‚Äòdid‚Äô get to tell people what to do with the money he invested. He clearly knows how to run a successful business (unlike some global leaders) and has actually achieved the intended success with the way he invested. So arguably he is probably the best person to be choosing how to spend the money. You telling me if you wanted to solve a big expensive problem globally you wouldn‚Äôt want him on the team?</p>
<p>Pretty sure these charities would welcome both financial and intellectual investment from Bill Gates:</p>

        <p>Ok, started watching it (as I‚Äôm always open to alternative opinions, and I‚Äôm a man of my word) but it‚Äôs an incredibly biased article/video series, and clearly targeting him from the outset rather than presenting the facts for viewers to draw their own conclusion.</p>
<p>Snide remarks about his ‚Äúvirus laden software‚Äù - Windows doesn‚Äôt ship with viruses, people write viruses for it as it had so many users. Now android has many many more users, they are facing a similar problem (and believe it or not, there are even viruses for Mac too). I mean the ‚ÄúTenticles‚Äù of the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, it‚Äôs very clear the goal of the video editor.</p>
<p>He isn‚Äôt an epidemiologist that is indeed true (nor does he claim to be one), but he is a VERY well read human being, reading way more content than I ever could in a day to inform his decisions. Indicated by his understanding of complex problems, and predicting there would be a global pandemic, societies reaction to which could have been reduced with proper preparation.</p>
<p>What other things about Bill Gates have you watched or read? As I‚Äôll be honest, this is a very one sided website, and so to be balanced you need to seek an alternative view to make your opinion. A sample size of one isn‚Äôt conducive of a correct outcome (hence why there are multiple jurors in a court case).</p>
<p>The bit that makes no sense is why Bill Gates would spend 1/2 his net worth ($50Bn) on increasing his public perception, when he could buy and island and have everything he needs without engaging with anyone ever. Just because Rockefeller may have done it, I‚Äôm not seeing any reason to assume Bill Gates is doing the same PR stunt, other than they are both rich). He is a huge advocate of educating the public on global health issues, and I don‚Äôt see the issue with trying to solve global health challenges to better the planet. </p>
<p>As the video proceeds, there are other people that Bill is compared to without any merit (a common narrative). You can‚Äôt just say, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs another rich guy, and this rich guy is bad, so therefore Bill Gates is bad‚Äù or ‚Äúhere‚Äôs someone who is fighting viruses and is corrupt, Bill Gates is fighting viruses therefore he is corrupt‚Äù - that‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúthere are pedophiles on Reddit, you‚Äôre on Reddit so you must be a pedophile‚Äù</p>
<p>He is sinking a bunch of money and energy in to actual results. You surely can‚Äôt claim the irradiation of polio is a scam? PR or no PR, he is doing good work.</p>
<p>As a side note Corbett has a lot of axes to grind on a lot of subjects, and his videos are incredibly misleading by walking viewers down a specific path - which is ok if the viewers use their critical thinking skills to seek alternative views, but if they don‚Äôt, of course the result will be an unbalanced myopic view of the topic in question.</p>
<p>Net net, after watching a couple of the videos I still don‚Äôt see what people have against him. He is using his wealth for good (others don‚Äôt, and he could also have not) but lives ARE being saved. Let‚Äôs say he does have a big influence in the global health industry and building credibility is his goal, if he‚Äôs making positive changes on reducing global deaths, solving global health risks, and generally saving lives, why is that a problem? 
As I said in the thread above, if the vaccines were produced BEFORE Covid-19 took hold) all the mask/lockdowns etc could have been prevented. </p>
<p>Sorry dude, probably not what you wanted to hear.</p>

        <p>Ok the reason for the lockdowns are either:<br>
A. To restrict person to person interaction to reduce the spread of a global virus and prevent the healthcare system being suddenly overwhelmed at any one point.<br>
OR<br>
B. To control people and subdue them in their own homes, so they can't go out, can't work and can't spend money to keep the economy buoyant. Reduce kids education and cause many businesses to go bankrupt?  </p>
<p>I'm not sure I see the lockdowns the same way you do. What do you think they are for?<br>
I work with a lot of New Zealanders, and I have to say when you don't politicize lockdowns (annoying as they are) they have worked.   </p>
<p>If people in general could be trusted to use a balanced view on how they interact with others during a pandemic, then there likely wouldn't be a need for any restrictions. However as we all know America in particular is heavily focused on the rights and freedoms of an individual - so if they want to go to a restaurant they should be able, and anyone who prevents that is a tyrant (regardless if you kill an old person or two because of it).   </p>
<p>I'm really confused by the responses on this thread, there feels like so much anger in this group.<br>
Some people are advocating for Capitalism, but then those who are the success stories of Capitalism are evil and have alternative agendas and are targeted by those who follow the American dream? Sounds like jealousy to me in all honesty.<br>
Are we saying philanthropy to save lives is a bad thing? I don't see anyone acknowledging the good Bill Gates has done - yeah he has a wide investment in charities and organizations (how else do you get global problems solved). If he's a bad guy, what's his end game? What do you mean he wants to blot out the sun? Given he has millions invested in future farming that would be a terrible way to raise crops without the sun (partly joking)!</p>
<p>Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I'm still yet to see bad things that Bill Gates is doing to warrant the attack. If he was taking back handed bribes from Pharma, or if he was creating illnesses to cure, or if he was creating vaccines that didn't work - sure, i'd agree. However, what he is doing is actually working though - across the world.</p>
<p>As for China (their new world order isn't really a 'new' world order, they've been on that path for a very, very long time). Canada (being part of the commonwealth) is also on a similar journey to the UK. Pubs opened last week and people were out putting money back in to the economy and re-exercising those kidneys once again. What new world order are you seeing there?</p>
<p>Yeah lockdown's suck, I haven't seen my family in over 14 months :( but the lockdown's are lifting, and people will be rightfully a little skeptical at first, before human desire for normality returns and we'll be eating and drinking together as before in no time. People can go back to worrying about other things, and hopefully we'll be able to resume normal dialogue in the pubs/bars, face to face about how we can prepare better for the next global event.<br>
I see many conspiracies in the world I just don't see evidence that Bill Gates is one of them - if I'm wrong in 20 years and he does indeed blot out the sun, I'll come back right here and indeed take the ridicule.</p>

        <p>Welp -  that last statement - wow.   </p>
<p>The thing with B is it actively hurts the economy, growth and development of the country, and so a decision that isn't taken lightly. It will also irritate the voters so also counterproductive.   </p>
<p>There are some power hungry people out there for sure, but how exactly are they going to enslave humanity? I understand the sentiment of feeling oppressed during the pandemic, being forced to wear a mask and stay home, but that will go away soon. What's next to enslave people?</p>
<p>In this thread (around Bill Gates) he's trying to actually free people from disease, from poverty and from a general horrible quality of life - that is enslaving them. I am also acutely aware of the irony of us sitting here debating whether spending money on vaccines and global healthcare to save the lives of those less fortunate than us (on our tech devices, with the ability of freedom speech, running water and access to healthcare) . Perhaps we should ask the people receiving or benefitting from his philanthropy whether they welcome it, or are grateful for it, or in fact have been asked to pay it back in any way? <br>
Another side note - Americans have such distrust of their government. I'm not entirely sure where particularly it originates, but as a simple comparative exercise the use of CCTV. In the UK and Europe (despite the MUCH higher quality of privacy regulation with GDPR etc) they still utilize a high volume of CCTV and trust the government to use that data wisely. <br>
In the US, CCTV is hard to come by as the people don't trust their government, down to repetitive mis-use and abuse, not to use it for the wrong reasons. <br>
I would argue the distrust of the government is the biggest driving force in all this. If you could see, relate, connect or empathize with a government trying to do the right thing would you wear a mask, or willingly lock down?   </p>
<p>For what its worth I don't feel enslaved, I wear a mask when I go out to see friends as I care about them and don't want to be the arsehole who gives someone a virus (i'm the same with a cold/flu, if i'm coughing and sneezing I stay home from work). I'd hope they'd do the same for me too.<br>
When lockdown lifts, I'll go see my family, eat out in restaurants again and generally and slowly go back to normality.</p>

        <p>Yeah downvoting is easy, providing a rebuttal takes some thought which appears to be too much trouble for some.
I‚Äôm not entirely sure what this subreddit stands for? I thought it was about fighting against the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù and preventing the old way of life disappearing. 
Not sure how attacking Bill Gates achieves that, if anything, listening to him years ago and preparing for the pandemic would have prevented the masks and lock downs and could have saved all the craziness.</p>

        <p>Definitely seems like the topic of the subredddit has drifted. I get a mix of "i dont want the vaccine please understand that and let me live my life" and "you're a fucking idiot for the taking the vaccine you stupid sheep i hope you all die from it and we rebuild society" so I really don't know anymore</p>
