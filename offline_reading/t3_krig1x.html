        <p>There is a huge amount of land area that's "intermediate destruction".  This was a good safety measure.  I think we should still do it.  Nuclear war can still happen, and I'm not sure I believe Mutually Assured Destruction is the outcome in 100% of scenarios.</p>
<p>That being said, masks are stupid.  I would compare them to a labido.</p>

        <p>To be fair, things like take cover under desks and whatnot make sense. The idea isn't that you'll survive a ground zero explosion but rather if the shockwave damages the building then you won't have shattered glass and parts of the roof hitting your head and face. After all, during bombing in world war two, if you didn't have a specific bomb shelter then you were advised to stand in the cupboard underneath your staircase. Not because it can survive a direct hit from a V2 or anything but just because staircases are usually the most solid part of a house and it would often stay standing even when the rest of the house had crumbled.</p>
<p>Masks on the other hand are like trying to run a mile in the rain while holding a sheet of tracing paper above your head to stay dry. Maybe it catches a couple of droplets but the reality is it's a fucking waste of paper and it's not helping anyone. My view is if you're in an area where coronavirus is spreading very quickly and you're classed as very vulnerable then wear a proper mask, either N95 or any CBRN rated mask. However, for everyone else then there's no point because you will not wear it properly, it increases your risk of pneumonia and it's a waste of resources which should be going somewhere useful.</p>

        <p>The shelter from the desks can also cov up r you from some of the light from the blast so you could save some of your body from being roasted alive.</p>
<p>Masks require pretty regular maintenance if you're using reusable fabric masks and fill up tour streets trash cans if you use paper.</p>

        <p>...And the same one that said "separate but equal", and "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or  prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of  speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to  assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.".  The same one that gave us the swine flu vaccine and rural electrification; ethnic interment camps and the FDIC.  </p>
<p>Let's try for a little perspective, okay?</p>
