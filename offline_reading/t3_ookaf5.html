    <strong>Losing hope</strong>
    <p><p>Recently I've been looking at mainstream covid subs. I knew it was bad, but fuck.. The cognitive dissonance is crazy. The lack of questioning and awareness is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>I've posted a few links/studies etc. but they just get pushed down the page due to inactivity.</p>
<p>You guys know dem feels?</p></p>

        <p>just a reminder, most active members in those subs are agents/shills/bots/dupes. the subs are controlled by the same group of people under the same directives, their goal is to push their agenda and discourage those that do not share their views.</p>
<p>if you are feeling this way, that means the subs have done a great job fulfilling their objectives.</p>
<p>notice how replies and downvotes are so coordinated over there?</p>
<p>same goes for the antimask/antivaxxer subs, they took up the popular names so that legit antimaskers &amp; antivaxxers can't participate in discussions without getting dissed or banned.</p>

        <p>No. Reddit is different from Twitter, Facebook etc, as in anyone can create a sub that is pretty much their own private property on reddit. and should their sub become big, the mods can manipulate it anyway they wants based on the benefits they received or agendas. The mods are free to delete or ban any users they regarded as negative asset, which explains why cross sub bans are rampant.</p>
<p>Twitter, Facebook etc, have a more centralized moderation, thus in order to manipulate these platforms, organizations will need to pay big bucks or benefits to these online social companies. So the cheaper alternatives would be hiring agents and shills to do the talking, or even bots, but most platforms dislike this as they are manipulating the platforms without benefiting the companies.</p>
<p>On reddit it is free for all. Bots are welcomed as Reddit is the pioneer in implementing bots on higher level tasks.</p>

        <p>Though they might differ in context, the overall goal has been the same. Control the flow of information whether it is by policy or community driven moderation. Though so far in terms of toxicity and comments Reddit is a whole new dimension.</p>

        <p>on those platforms their directives are very clear as daylight, thus more user tend to revolt.</p>
<p>here on reddit every sub can manipulate their members, they get confused or brainwashed into their ideas. remember on most platforms the moderation comes from top, if you did not post something that is against the TOC, or against their clear directives you won't get censored, so there allows some sort of discussion. On reddit, mods can totally turn their subs into 1 sided. Anyone not aligned will get banished. For example there are alot of subs that started just for interest, however they grew super big and the mods felt they have super powers due to the amount of members they have under their control, so they start using the subs as a platform to move their ideas, this is why you see subs like awww cross banning users in NNN that never participated in awww.</p>
<p>Or maybe you could say these guys already had it all planned out since early days, by creating popular subs and so they can gather members, remember 90 out of the top 150 subreddits are run by the same 5 mods.</p>

        <p>Exactly, that's why I'm confused that you're arguing that reddit is decentralized. Yes it has small subs that are able to operate fairly independently, but as soon as they get popular enough they are co-opted.</p>

        <p>remember, not all of those mods work for reddit. different from most social platforms where mods have 1 big boss. on reddit the mods may act on their own, may follow reddit's direction, maybe bought over by companies, or even companies planting agents and creating subs to gain control over the members. thus it is much easier for smaller companies to conspire with individual/group of mods. Think Reddit as a huge mall with individual store owners renting the shops from 1 owner, some run by same group of people, compared to say Walmart or K mart where everything is under 1 roof and everyone works for the same employer.</p>
<p>This is why every big sub you go it seems someone is manipulating the flow of discussion and information.</p>
<p>This makes most users harder to identify which sub has been manipulated, until they get censored or banned.</p>
<p>for platforms like facebook and tweeter, it is clear as daylight what their directives are. on reddit you don't know who bears what intentions. It would be like WWII Allies vs Axis, vs a free for all post apocalypse scenario.</p>

        <p>Remember reddit comprises of many subs with many different categories, so many companies and organization and governments can dip their hand in to any of these subs. Fb generally only have general mods, they dont have enough manpower to mod everything or manipulate everything so they can do maybe top level censorship.</p>
<p>Here hardcore mods can actually read every single post or have a bot read it and decide to delete or suspend. I have been censored or banned for posts that were weeks old. No human mod would be so free unless they have bots. And trust me big corporates cannot carry out censorship as detailed as reddit. They can do blanket type bans but not to a surgical level. Remember mods on facebook are mere salary takers. They go home after work.</p>

        <p>Not all at all, just the bigger subs. The special interest subs are generally ok. Sure occasionally you will run into some SJW mods but its kinda rare.</p>
<p>Remember many of us probably has our own subs since it is so easy to create one, as long as it isnt those big interest subs like gaming or sports where you have fanboys and console wars most are ok.</p>

        <p>I respectfully disagree. Because even if the mods aren’t bent in every sub, the rules of Reddit pervade and they can step in any time. </p>
<p>This own sub is well underway. The same proven playbook of infiltrate, control, replace and finally destroy. How many subs have we seen go that way?</p>
<p>Just now I had a mod in a religious philosophy sub have to execute a blatantly corrupt rule which is expressly against the philosophy in question. But he did it because in the end they’re all corruptible and most have already had the groundwork laid. </p>

        <p>Reddit do not have the kind of manpower to moderate the subs like facebook do, reddit using free mods to mod their own subs and only intervene for serious offense. At most they deploy bots, or maybe some of the supermods are part of the reddit team, or employees of reddit using alt to power mod without reddit knowing.</p>

        <p>Just curious, have you found any evidence of this? I keep hearing that they are bots and other fake accounts, but I haven’t actually come upon a reason to think they aren’t just losers who never look up from their social media.</p>

        <p>there will be fake accounts or duplicates on every single social platforms as long as there are practicing bans, people have alt to help boost their main accounts, or post things that they don't want their mains, could be ill intent, or could be just wanting to keep anonymous (for example trading using main account but socialize using alt).</p>
<p>as for bots, look around, it is obvious reddit implemented many bots to interact with us, sure they are tagged with "bot", but you can't believe they can't do the same without tagging them as bots? most subs deploys automoderator to delete, highlight and even ban users.</p>
<p>bots can also be used to collect IDs of users in certain subs like NNN, put them on a hitlist, and with a button mods can ban users on those list. automation has come a far way.</p>
<p>there are also bots that collect posts based on replies and votes, put them in a database and categorized them, so once another bot that scans the posts identify the type of post we posted, they can browse the database and pull out an archived post, and maybe modify certain variables to suit the intended replies. however to be effective, it would require a user intervention, like look at bots recommendation and approve, you know, just like how Financial Institution approves your loan, human interacts with you, key in your data and the A.I analyses the data and provides their conclusion and recommendations, the human then decides to approve or disapprove, or modify your submissions.</p>
<p>there are also plans to utilize A.I to replace human judge.</p>
<p>so yea naturally for a forum like Reddit who is the pioneer in assigning A.Is to higher level tasks, it's a no brainer we have bots, both deployed by the company and individuals to try to change the flow here.</p>
<p>coz i know some small forums actually have pilot runs of few interactive bots, but they are more towards experimentation and try to keep their forums alive, but the userbase has to be big enough so the bots can blend in like a human without getting exposed.</p>
<p>as for Reddit, to spot simple bots, they have some sort of routine, that they cannot give you a direct answer, but will divert a question with another question, similar to politicians, but they will give you a general reply that isn't customized to your discussion. they will also helplessly repeat certain stuffs if you keep dragging on the conversation until they run out of replies.</p>

        <p>Always the sience argument. He can't trust science. He trusts in science conducted by an unknown group claiming their application if science is the fundamental truth.</p>
<p>People these days say very dumb things like trusting in science whilst science is an actual tool.

        <p>Yeah noticed it seems more and more people are falling in line so they don't go over the ledge. People who were skeptical of all this the whole time now claiming they believe in it. For every 50-100 that start believing all the propaganda, about 10-20 stop believing in it. At least that's what the turnover online makes me think and that is concerning. How can you see through the fog for so long and then start smoking it like crack?</p>

        <p>it's called herd mentality. when everyone around you starts eating shit and claiming they taste great, you would start to doubt yourself and probably try finger licking some shit, you might find it tastes awful but everyone will be telling you you have taste issue and they taste great, you start to take a few more licks and finally convinced yourself that shit tastes great. And you now go on trying to convince other non believers that they should start eating shit and shit tastes great.</p>
<p>before you know it the human kind starts feasting on shit. those that are sane enough to stand their ground will be called insane and a witch hunts ensure to either convert all the remnants or erase them from existence.</p>
<p>to some people, getting majority people to comply is not the goal, they have an obsession to have EVERYONE comply.</p>
<p>it's something like clockwork orange, ancient tactics used by missionaries.</p>

        <p>We are entering the age of aquarius, it signifies the lifting of the veil. You can believe whatever you want but I can see that it's only a matter of time before this whole thing collapses on itself. It's not something I can fully explain but it's this deep feeling I've had since yesterday after my eye opened a bit more, you need to be ready. Be ready to grow your own food and be independent from this system. Learn to let go or be dragged.</p>

        <p>For the better I'd bet. We will see the truth behind everything and be freed from it, but it's a matter of choice I feel. </p>
<p>Although I'm not entirely sure what's gonna happen I have a feeling it'll be liberating. Plus idk if you've heard this but over the past year there's been massive spiritual awakenings (which is what I had like last year) and people are seeing clearer because of it, and i feel like it'd be kinda cruel for the universe to wake all these people up just for no reason..</p>
<p>Somethings gonna happen so be ready I guess</p>

        <p>In this world full of deceit &amp; lies, it can be really hard to believe in something that you did not witness with your very eyes.</p>
<p>I mean read up today's newspaper, how many news were related to what you actually saw? For example earthquake in Japan, or Hurrican Katrina, unless you were there and survived the incident, it can sometimes be hard to believe whether it is real or fabricated.</p>
<p>Just like Nasa first landing on the Moon, is it real? is it filmed in a studio? Only a small group of people know the truth.</p>
<p>So what i can say is, you believe in what you believe in. The truths doesn't really matter, because even if it is the real truth and you don't believe it, it is not the truth.</p>

        <p>If you need a little bit of hope restored, go to the Covid video section on YouTube. Some of them had to turn the comments off. The ones that still show the number of likes and dislikes speak volumes. Either we are the only ones looking at those videos, or they are extremely unpopular. They want us to feel alone. Yes, there definitely are brainwashed people, but there are more bots and shills than truly passionate Branch Covidians.</p>

        <p>sometimes i wonder if some of the comments in a youtube videos are highly liked just because of certain user that seems to be really popular in commenting, like superstars, but they do not have any big videos, feels like those likes are fake, of course there are genuine ones.</p>
<p>i also wonder if some of those comments that uses a base joke are bots or just humans trying to mimic the joke.</p>

        <p>Never lose hope sir. Remember that with time, people will only get red-pilled, there's no going the other way. I think the necessity for boosters so soon after initial course &amp; terrible side effects means about the vaxx especially take up will progressively drop</p>

        <p>&rt;Immune System'. </p>
<p>Influenza virus =/= coronavirus. There's a reason why vaccination is needed, because in this case your immune system isn't enough to defend against it. </p>
<p>The influenza virus mutates on an almost yearly basis making vaccines ineffective. But the virus itself is pretty tame and has a much lower fatality rate than covid. This is because majority of individuals can recover on their own and those who do suffer complications are able to go to a hospital without worrying about capacity.</p>
<p>Covid on the other hand has a much higher fatality rate and has a higher chance of causing medical complications. It does not mutate as quickly as influenza can.</p>
<p>If you were to treat covid like a common flu you are effectively damning our medical staff and hospital infrastructure to their graves. The hospitals cannot take such a massive load of patients constantly having complications from the virus. The mental toll on healthcare workers would be massive. We would need exponentially more medical equipment and staff than we do now to keep deaths low (Why the fuck do you think we needed to flatten the curve?). The cost would be massive. So why do that rather than just vaccinate against it when the virus cant mutate quickly? Treating it as a flu would be even more impractical in terms of cost.</p>
<p>Unless you're saying we shouldnt care for those who get medical conplications from covid and just let them die on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Stop being a fucking idiot and wake up. Its not a flu. People like you who dont understand the pontential problems covid could cause and your selfish thinking is propagating even more covid disinformation  and distrust. Covid is not supposed to be a never ending cycle like the flu and dont make it seem like it will be.</p>
<p>Credit to u/Pooplayer1 for putting it so aptly.</p>

        <p>Yeah I made a post in a libertarian sub talking about respecting everyone's decisions about getting vaccinated. The result was getting downvoted to hell and having people say I was the reason the government was making lockdowns. Yes Im the bad guy for the government being authoritarian it's not their fault. </p>
<p>The situation online sounds horrible but most of the people I know really don't care. Lets not take these people as the overwhelming majority because only 56% of the US is vaccinated. That's huge guys we aren't alone!!</p>
