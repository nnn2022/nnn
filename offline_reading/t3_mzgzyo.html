    <strong>Just a rant nothing more ...</strong>
    <p><p>I am laying here sleepless and just wanted to express this to like minded people to get it out in an effort to process things.</p>
<p>I am angry. Very angry. I started out fearful a year ago before things started smelling funny. By late April I knew something wasn’t right. By may I was maskless outside and have not worn one outside since then ever. I work in healthcare , I have coworkers who agree.  I am a single woman alone in NYC and I knew well enough to keep my suspicions to myself at that point because 99 percent of the population here believes we are all about to die and we are murderers if we breathe and live life normally. </p>
<p>I soon discovered two coworkers and an ex BF I speak to regularly were also starting to feel the same. I don’t get to see them in person but we started speaking daily and we realized we were all on the same page. We still are. I thank God for them daily. </p>
<p>Virtually everyone else who I was close to I am not speaking to regularly anymore. There was no fallout , they are just extremely terrified still and I know I cannot speak to them at all in a normal way. When we do speak they tell me are still double masking , wearing face shields , getting their vaccines , calling anyone who is living normally all the names we know too well at this point. They know I live alone, have no family , was extremely alone during this and they still were too afraid to see me. If it wasn’t for a close friend who isn’t insane I would have had little to no real human contact this entire year. He and I went on mini vacations , we get together regularly , we have sleep overs and watch movies and cook and rent a car and drive to random places to get away. Once again, I thank God for him. I was blessed to have him as my angel this year. </p>
<p>So the anger...It’s a rollercoaster. I have gone from fear, to confusion to sadness to frustration and now intense anger. Anger at whoever decided to do this to us. Anger at people who seriously believed that racism was a “public health crisis” and that massive protests and violent riots were ok ,but going to church and seeing loved ones in person was dangerous and unsafe. It all should have ended RIGHT THERE. It made zero sense and anyone with a brain knew it. As much as I try to twist my mind I cannot see any way that was even remotely believable but millions of people accepted this blatantly outrageous lie and not only accepted it, they spewed vicious comments at anyone who pointed out the absurdity of this. They lectured, they posted black squares, they judged anyone who saw that this was not what we were being told. They DEHUMANIZED us so they could justify their hatred and wish us dead from the virus they accepted as their personal lord and savior. </p>
<p>I am angry at people who have accepted this for an entire year, who think science is a set in stone thing, it’s not meant to be challenged or questioned ,that it’s something a washed up career bureaucrat rent-a-Dr can control the entire population with.  I can’t see people the same way again. I now cannot watch TV or listen to a radio because I see the lies everywhere and I often feel like it’s a different language I have learned to speak and interpret. HOW DO THEY NOT SEE ITS ABOUT MORE THAN A VIRUS?</p>
<p>I want whoever the people are who are responsible for this atrocity to pay for this, to be on trial, to lose everything, to be imprisoned like so many of us were this year when they knew how wrong this was.  I know it will never happen though. I didn’t have a high level of trust in government to begin with , but it is now nonexistent. When something is recommended by the government or self appointed authorities i immediately think I should probably do just the opposite. I feel so traumatized and I’m not a person who ever speaks like this. I’ve had a lot of real trauma and deep loss in my life and I am a very strong person. I have always found a way to grieve and process things and move forward. This, however, it feels like it has broken me. I see others as barely human, weak, cowardly, vindictive, willing to imprison me just for the crime of breathing and being human. I cannot stand how their fear makes me feel dirty and like a vector of disease. I have times when I feel like this is never going to end and even if it does it will never fully go back to normal just like 911. Every day is a struggle, my mind rarely shuts off from this. I have been watching old movies lately as an escape, I took a vacation last week and it helps but everything feels pointless and hopeless. </p>
<p>I almost wish I could be one of them....believe taking a fake vaccine would return life to normalcy but I know it won’t. I live in the testing ground for the vaccine passport here in nyc. Seeing people honestly think this is only about their health is another issue I can’t even get into. Everyone around me appears to be under some sort of CNN induced spell. </p>
<p>Anyway, if you made it this far thank you. I am now tired and needed to get this out. I appreciate you all here. Being around others who see all of this is a comfort.</p></p>

<p>I can answer from second-hand experience just from watching my folks. It's hell on earth. They truly believe every word the "experts" on the magic box and that everything is on the up-and-up as long as it's not associated with Orange Emmanuel Goldstein.</p>

        <p>Hi. I’m a fellow NYer myself and wanna share that living in this city has absolutely killed me...on top of all of this craziness, I lost my husband this year (not to COVID). He was my best friend and my true soulmate especially with this stuff. We were the “crazy conspiracy theorists” of our families/friend groups. </p>
<p>We were cautious at first, barely saw eachother. About 3 weeks in we realized something fishy was going on and started hanging out and haven’t been wearing masks outside since. Thankfully we had a good group of friends who also feel the same about the “pandemic” and the vaccines. </p>
<p>It sucks that he’s gone and I can’t help but hate NY for it. We had big dreams of leaving this city, having a family, etc. It’s just sad that there’s not more people outraged about this here. It’s sad that this has lasted so long and no one bats an eye and people continue to wear their masks like it’s some fashion trend. I hate living in this city and I wish there were more people like you and me. Know you’re not alone. One day this will all be over and all the people responsible for this will be held accountable. If not in this life, they’ll still for sure have to face God. </p>
<p>Sorry for the rant, please don’t lose hope 💕🙏🏼</p>

        <p>I am so so sorry for the year you have endured , what a terrible loss for you I am here if you need to vent. What a year you have had , my deepest condolences to you 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 I feel the same too, where on earth are all the people like us? Where are the real old school New Yorkers, the people who are rough and have a bullshit meter? I want to leave too and I have always liked this city. Now I hate the people who live here. They are miserable cowards. Please take good care of yourself, better days are coming for you !</p>

        <p>So sorry about your situation too, I was reading tonight where it looks like you may be getting rid of your governor, I wish we could remove ours too! I’ve been looking for a job for months now, if I could find a job elsewhere I would be gone in a heartbeat. I’m going to keep looking and trying to take it one day at a time, I hope things look up for you guys too!</p>

        <p>&rt;The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. When you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of people we're trying to save, but until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand that most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.</p>

        <p>I just re-watched this a few nights ago and the one line that really struck a chord with me was when Neo complained that his eyes were hurting and Morpheus said that's because you've never used them before</p>

        <p>Even though we can’t meet in person, there is a community here that welcomes you warmly and validates your experience. I’m feeling the same way. I can’t sleep, it’s 1:47 am. I’m thankful that I’m in a lax southern state but my blood boils when I think of the less fortunate who are being abused. I want to go out in the streets and speak my peace.

<p>This is beautifully put, thank you for writing this. I’m in California, and I fall asleep at night with many of the same thoughts. You truly are not alone and I believe there are many more like us who are still afraid to speak up. We have to keep living our truth, as they say, and hopefully others will catch up. </p>

        <p>I feel exactly the same way. Its really hard to process how the world went from usual crazy to complete madness just like that. And how many people there are, completely buying it all. Like, I always knew a lot of people are rather dull, but its insane how little people think for themselves. Ive noticed this prior to corona already, everyone needs a manual for everything... I cant comprehend why people disvalue their own experience so much.</p>

        <p>Yes, they are outright denying things they know to be true from their personal experience! It's wild! It's almost as if they have some sort of weird brain disorder or something I can't even explain it. But I feel like I am a different species from them at this point. Our brains definitely are not operating on the same frequency.</p>

        <p>Great rant. You very eloquently put into words so many things I cannot. </p>
<p>If you’re able move out of NY. I moved from a very locked down place, Ontario, to Florida and it’s really helped me recover and be less angry. </p>

        <p>Lucky you I am so glad you got out of there I've heard Canada is even worse! I wish I didn't despise humidity and heat, I would definitely go down to Florida! I am a snow lover, winter is my favorite season I come alive in the cold weather! Not really sure what I'm going to do. It's much more livable in Upstate New York I've been going up there a lot and staying for weeks at a time. That said I am still under the same government as this hell hole City.</p>

        <p>Well put. I’m originally from NYC and so thankful that I moved to a “rebel” state before this because I would’ve been very isolated and even angrier. Most of my family and friends are brainwashed. I follow ny media and most others have been running an indoctrination campaign. </p>
<p>When I came back recently for the first time, I also was angry. Angry that people had been subdued into submission and not realized it. Angry at the state of the city. Angry about my uncle’s delayed tumor diagnosis (thankfully, at this point, it looks benign) that absolutely would’ve been caught earlier if not for Covid fear and restrictions. Angry for all the small business owners, trainers, hair stylists, etc who were sacrificed by knowledge workers who can telecommute. Angry for children who depend on schools for meals and abuse detection/intervention. Covid didn’t cause all of this. The response did.</p>
<p>I do believe that racism is a public health issue but I also noticed the utter hypocrisy around the protests (and I, as a black person who’s well versed in racism yet finds most ny liberals insufferable and disingenuous, felt that the protests were 1) performative/opportunistic bunk past a certain point and 2) an expected consequence of pent-up energy from lockdowns). I foolishly thought that people might realize COVID was being overhyped when the protests didn’t result in death spikes, but that didn’t happen.</p>
<p>I can’t help but wonder what’s underway to minimize public knowledge of the true harm that’s been done. Atrocity indeed.</p>
