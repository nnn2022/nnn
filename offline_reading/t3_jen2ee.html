    <strong>Lockdowns and masks are no longer as popular really among the public. MSM still pushing it as a form of extreme damage mitigation for the mistakes of governments across the globe.</strong>
    <p><p>I have this semi-optimistic (still cautious) feeling that people are changing their views finally and waking up to the massive hoax surrounding Covid. </p>
<p>I was on Facebook and saw an article from Sky News, the title was: "<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/six-of-the-best-expert-views-from-skys-postcode-lockdown-a-divided-nation-12108840?fbclid=IwAR2QZbcEwk3zVz7lFuLISO-XscaKhmo5cYd6rIgQwqgccB4FqfOEoYD8XnM">Six of the best expert views from Sky's Postcode Lockdown: A Divided Nation</a>" (link doesn't seem to work, I wonder why). I looked at the comments and I kid you not, 6-7 out of 10 comments are sceptical of lockdowns, mention the GBD, mention Sweden as an example to follow. Generally, the feeling was "Right, we're fed up of this constant negative narrative, time to think of more sustainable solutions, lockdowns can't be the solution".</p>
<p>Feels like the tide really is turning, even in the comments section of such a big part of MSM (Sky News). </p>
<p>Anyone want to share their own episodes or stories that are restoring faith in humanity and common sense? :)</p></p>

        <p>It's the same on Daily Mail comments section. Overwhelmingly against masks and lockdown, many openly calling out the conspiracy.</p>

        <p>I do feel that more and more people are becoming fed up with the lockdowns, masks, and restrictions and are only continuing to go along with it because everyone else is.  They are waiting for "permission" to go back to living like normal.</p>
<p>It's why the media and governments are ratcheting up the propaganda so much now and being more blatant about it.  The pro-mask messaging is everywhere now.</p>

        <p>It's been for months and it's a sign of desperation by them... The deep state lost the war, there's just too much push back against the "new normal" and the great reset. Majority know it's a hoax already, by early next year, everyone will know it's a hoax except for the OCD's and mental disorder types.</p>
<p>The propaganda networks and governments in the majority of advance economies are puppets for the global deep state which operates out of Geneva through their fronts, the UN and some NGO's.</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s interesting that I have not seen any public polls about this in months months now. I suspect these measures no longer poll well in most states- that is probably why!</p>

        <p>It must be nice for all of you haven't lost friends and family due to COVID. Maybe when that happens, you will finally realize WHY we wear masks. If wearing a mildly uncomfortable piece of fabric on my face could potentially save even ONE life, to me it's worth it. I am sorry you grew up not to care about someone... Like my siblings ex father-in-law whose wife, children and grandchildren now have to live life without him (and yes it was COVID, he had no underlying health conditions). I also am happy that none of you have friends that are currently in the hospital fighting for their lives while her husband and 3 kids are sick at home with COVID, can't even visit her... Must be so nice. How about you, for just ONE second, think about someone else for a change? I know it's a lot to ask for people who care for nothing and no one but themselves, but just put yourself in their shoes.</p>

        <p>Don't come here and accuse me of "growing up not to care about someone". How dare you. </p>
<p>I am sorry for those you and your loved ones lost to Covid, HOWEVER, Covid is not suddenly the only thing killing people nowadays. You just wait and see the excess death number that will be due to the consequences of lockdowns, social distancing, unemployment, poverty, backlog in cancer screening + other illnesses, etc. Just because you are not seeing those numbers clearly today doesn't mean it takes a genius to figure out that is going to be the very sad future that could have been avoided if half of the world didn't just panic!</p>
<p>Masks make me feel uneasy, I don't like the idea of altering in any way the air I am breathing. As far as I am concerned, I am being forced to wear something without anyone sitting down and showing me HARD EVIDENCE that they are effective. </p>
<p>Why don't you ask yourself the question you asked me: Why don't you, for ONE second, think about those people for a change?</p>

        <p>I care because I do the ONE thing that the CDC, The WHO, Dr. Fauci, and the pandemic team all suggest. I WEAR A MASK! Quit being a cry baby and wear a mask. Might as well get used to it now, because when Biden takes over, he will implement a law that everyone has to wear a mask every day for 100 days. You are selfish. Period. I will protect myself, my family and my friends by wearing one STUPID PIECE OF Material on my face. You can spread corona to all your fiends and family. I am too busy caring about mine. Just don't come closer than 6 feet without a mask on. Period. At least here, it is against the law to enter an establishment without one. Besides that, my surgeon, who spent 8 hours rebuilding my hip, which wearing a mask the ENTIRE time, thinks you are quite the drama queen. :D All I see is a selfish child having a temper tantrum. Wow, the immaturity. I truly hope for your sake YOU don't pass it on to someone because wearing a piece of cloth on your face is SUCH a burden and SSOOOOO hard. (should I start singing, "No body knows the trouble I've seen.. No body knows my sorrows." Gimme a break and grow up.</p>

        <p>Oooh that's where the very angry private message came from, I see. Well, you're a bit of a lost cause so I'll let you do you, I don't engage with people like you because it would just be a waste of time. Also, you talk about me having a temper tantrum...That's funny, have you seen the way you write? :D Pot calling the kettle...</p>

        <p>Yes let's think about the people being evicted because they were not considered essential businesses. Let's not forgot the amount of cancer screenings missed that will result in a death toll higher then covid. What about all the suicides up 600% from last year. Those poor deaf people that depend on being able to read lips but can't since everyone is in masks. Fuck em right? Your family is more important.</p>
