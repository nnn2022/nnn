    <strong>My kid‚Äôs school is letting parents opt-in to in-person learning in two weeks... and doomers are STILL complaining</strong>
    <p><p>My six year old FINALLY has the opportunity to go back to school in person. There‚Äôs a bunch of security theater but at least he‚Äôd be back. But now that cases are ‚Äúsurging‚Äù parents and students are wanting the school to delay opening again. A bunch of teenagers on the district‚Äôs instagram page are complaining about being ‚Äúforced‚Äù back to school and how their lives are being put at risk. Parents who work from home are demanding that kids stay home. Did I mention that in-person learning is OPTIONAL? </p>
<p>Doomers want to ruin everything I‚Äôm so sick of it.</p></p>

        <p>Socialism. That‚Äôs how it works. </p>
<p>Anything that doesn‚Äôt implement the same sweeping measures across the board for <em>everyone</em> is not only ‚Äúuncivilized‚Äù... it‚Äôs ‚Äúdestructive‚Äù and ‚Äúbarbaric‚Äù, too.</p>
<p>...save, of course, the politicians, celebrities, ‚Äúexperts‚Äù, and wealthy businessmen who promote said sweeping rules. </p>
<p>Comrades usually lack the capacity to see them flying in private jets without masks, attending mask-free parties, clubs, and social events, breaking social distancing and quarantine rules... oh, yeah. And sending their children to private schools that are happily open for allüôÇ</p>

        <p>so many people who support the lockdowns say things like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a pandemic going on we ALL have to make sacrifices‚Äù. Its not enough that people have died because of a disease we can‚Äôt control, people have died AND the people who are likely to not die need to have their way of life completely upended. Because equal suffering is always better than unequal suffering I guess.</p>

        <p>I wanted my boy to experience regular school for the first time but my wife is doing homeschooling since they‚Äôll shut down anyhow. Was hoping two of three would be off to school for me to get stuff done and relax also. But I‚Äôm not getting my stuff done and always having to learn/relearn a computer program I didn‚Äôt use til after high school. Some of these programs are too advanced for a 2nd grader/kindergarten age kid</p>

        <p>The positive for me is I work 4-1030am and wife breeds(shows pre covid) sells dogs from home. And my daughter has focus issues also. The curriculum is in my opinion too advanced for 2nd grade. 
The kindergarten stuff my 5yr old is doing he is blasting thru. 
Both teachers are different ends of the spectrum</p>
