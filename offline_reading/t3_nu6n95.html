    <strong>The Governments Are 100% NOT Deserving Of Our Trust. Why? Pick Up A History Book!</strong>
    <p><p>It is an insane notion to suggest that we should trust governments and authority without question. </p>
<p>If anything, government and authority are the #1 groups that we should be skeptical of.</p>
<p>Excuse my language, but pick up a fucking history book. </p>
<p>Chernobyl? To those in the surrounding areas it was a conspiracy. Until the Soviets couldn't contain the conspiracy anymore. Oops. </p>
<p>Late 1920's Germany? Oddly reminiscent of modern day Canada, but this time around different beliefs and different problems. The behavior is the same. </p>
<p>CIA importing cocaine into USA? Conspiracy. Until they released declassified files proving it wasn't a conspiracy. </p>
<p>CIA assassinating foreign leaders, drugging Americans with LSD, and controlling foreign governments? That ladies and gentleman was a "conspiracy" until they were forced to release proof they were doing it. Just look into the ridiculous attempts on Castro, for example. </p>
<p>Tiananmen Square Massacre? Conspiracy. Well, if you live in China that is. The rest of the world knows the truth. </p>
<p>Draining people of blood? The first American President Washington likely died from "Doctors" draining him of blood. The scientific consensus at the time was that draining blood would help you heal from a disease faster. </p>
<p>Smoking? That was once considered healthy! </p>
<p>Tuskegee Experiments- Remember when America experimented on poor black men and let them die &amp; suffer? You probably would've been a conspiracy theorist if you went to that town to try spread the truth. </p>
<p>Of course this doesn't mean conspiracy is TRUE by default. There are tons of ridiculous ones out there. That's the pain of a free world - there's always gonna be one person with some whacky idea that truly is crazy and unfounded. </p>
<p>All I'm saying is that it's abundantly clear that governments are undeserving of our trust without question. </p>
<p>The censorship, lies, propaganda, etc. indicate that we as a collective world are headed in an extremely dangerous direction. </p>
<p>Even if you think that Covid is truly so bad that it justifies lockdowns or whatever, you should NOT have to censor those that would argue otherwise. </p>
<p>It only shows how sensitive and fragile the thought is of doomers if they have to censor and manipulate in order to get their way. </p>
<p>Truth can stand test to trial and still stand. And that is why the governments are hiding, lying, and using propaganda to control you.</p></p>

        <p>The worst part is almost everyone knows this.  </p>
<p>It's just in this case, they seem to have completely abandoned their sense and logic for fear of both a virus, and for fear of appearing as a "selfish" "conspiracy theorist".</p>

        <p>The governments of Europe and America rounded up our best men for 3 generations in a row and sent them off to horrific wars, AGAINST EACH OTHER NO LESS. Then, the last 2 generations of American soldiers have been more harmed by their government than the enemy.</p>
<p>And we wonder how we were left with bearded, man-bun sporting soy boys running through our cities now.</p>
<p>Governments are in the business of democide. Why? Because Satan is in control of everyone of them. It's really that simple.</p>
