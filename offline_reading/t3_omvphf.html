        <p>Honestly, at this point in time I am looking for a way to escape. People can take this as a regular every-day thing, the usual government bullshit... but for me this is way bigger and very, very serious.</p>
<p>Protests will do fuck all, "social distancing" and brain-washing has made it impossible to reason with the vast majority of people anymore.</p>
<p>Change IS happening, and you can either jump on board and accept it for what is or fucking fight for what is right.</p>
<p>Anything said in this manner is down-voted to oblivion or outright censored, make of it what you will and do what you deem necessary, but fuck this system... fuck our dystopian future... And fucking do something about it.
It's happening whether you like it or not, censorship and propaganda has made sure of that.. Question is, who is ready to resist it...</p>

        <p>So I have a few podcasts/radio I listen to pretty regular. And I get for reasons obvious to us all, that they cant say some stuff nor advocate for them. But I think it's well understood for many that you are correct.</p>
<p>Asking nicely will do fuck all. Having signs displayed with a few hundred people on sidewalks will do fuck all. </p>
<p>The only issue for me is that we still, as a society, have so much to lose. So there may never be a concerted effort in the time necessary to stop this train. I fear that only when society has completely disintegrated into a survival of the fittest will people accept the circumstances as what they are.</p>

        <p>Anti Great Reset, anti new world order, anti world economic forum group(Great Unplugging)</p>
<p>A group called the Great Unplugging created a great plan against the nwo. The founder is very aware of, davos, world economic forum and more. </p>
<p>The founder had a idea where we make our infrastructure by all of us donating infrastructure we desire and buy the products from our own infrastructure . Instead of relying and buying things that would support the big business that are part of the new world order. Like IPhones or more. </p>
<p>If you guys think this a controlled opposition or a honeypot trap. You guys can figure that out by going to our discord and ask us about it. Rather then say we are without any evidence to it. Also we don’t have a leader we have a founder. There is no big figure/leader type person. We are more of a people’s group with an idea.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to explain this fully but there’s a discord where you can talk to the owner about it. But there will be a website soon. We have created a alternate face book. All links below.</p>
<p>Ask any questions below I’ll try to answer too </p>
