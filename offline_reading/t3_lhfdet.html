    <strong>[rant] my workplace is turning into a shitshow</strong>
    <p><p>At work, I have an assistant manager who’s an absolute asshole about masks and whatever else. Full on mental illness level, and regularly guilts the customers/ employees cause they’re obese and we’re responsible for their health apparently. They regularly bark at customers if it slides down their face even a little. Sometimes I’m taken back by how fucking rude they are. My other manager, on the other hand, has said before that they’re sick of all this bullshit and don’t believe in the masking. They often let it slide if they see someone without one which I’m so, so glad about (but only if the assistant manager is gone otherwise we all get lectured)</p>
<p>This has all changed now because apparently people from corporate have been watching through the cams. Shit has been stirred up and they’re pissed at most of us for not complying with their ever changing bullshit policies. But this has just gave the assistant manager more reasons to lecture us. The tension is so thick right now because everyone’s butting heads and it’s all so stupid. I’m in the process of finding another job now but ugh.</p></p>

        <p>This is exactly why I stopped even considering working for other people. Be your own boss. Even if you'll make a bit less this way, that's the way to go. Fuck 'em I say.</p>

        <p>I got caught without one by a secret shopper and written up.  My boss and I laughed about that one.  </p>
<p>I'm going to start claiming religious freedom.  It's against my personal religion to slowly suffocate myself thank you.</p>

        <p>Every day I thank god I'm not in retail anymore. A complete shit show even before this nonsense. </p>
<p>Now I did get to see some school office staff discuss their misery after taking the cooties shot the other day. Migraine, flu like symptoms, stomach pain, no strength in arm one got the shot in. Various things amongst them. And it's just like. You dopes do realize those are all very bad things and signs that your body is telling you that whatever that shit is it's not something you should be putting in it.</p>
<p>But whatever. The vaccine is encouraged but not mandatory. Yet. </p>
<p>Custodial school staff in SoCal here. And they'll be getting a forged vaccine card when they do make it mandatory. If I get caught then they can fire me. For that or for not taking it. Doesn't matter. I'm at terms with it and I'll deal with it when the time comes which I'm sure is soon. And I keep my mask off when I'm working. I'm alone and if there's someone else with me they're across the room at closest anyway.</p>

        <p>I stopped working for someone who had the biggest mouth on social media about people having to follow the covid-rules blahblah..but midst in a lockdown he hired me to clean his house while barking at others to stay home. </p>
<p>Rules for thee but not for me is how I would describe him. I quit after I saw him rant on a poor lady that was badly injured on a photo on social media. He wished death upon her and all others who were part of a demonstration against these awfull harmfull laws that are currently up.</p>
<p>The man is a full on narc and I don't feel save in someones house who talks to people like that.</p>
