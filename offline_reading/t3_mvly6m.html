    <strong>Just a reminder that there is more to this life than simply staying alive.</strong>
    <p><p>Most of you are intelligent and aware and know this already, but for some reason the coronachondriacs just can’t grasp this concept.  Or is it that they know it inherently but refuse to admit it because that would make their house of cards crumble?</p>
<p>Don’t let anyone convince you that what is going on in the West with regard to Covid-19 isn’t tyranny. There are varying degrees of tyranny. The fact that they have stripped away fewer freedoms from us than North Korea’s dictator has taken from his subjects does not make our governments’ actions morally acceptable.</p>
<p>A life under tyranny is no life at all. That’s why the quote by Patrick Henry “Give me liberty, or give me death!” resonates so much.</p></p>

        <p>Existence is pointless without experiencing LIFE. Sitting and staring at the same four walls day in day out isn't LIFE. For the last year we have all been held captive in our homes. Behind masks. Distanced from friends/ family. </p>
<p>The worst part of me is realising that I am one of the only people in my social circle that feels a strong sense of resistance against the vaccine. Most see it as the way to return to life as they knew it. It isn't. I feel sad for them. And angry that my freedoms are being sold down the river in exchange for a few weeks/ months of "normalcy" for those that conform. </p>
<p>If they loved their children/grandchildren and had the foresight to see that they are destroying life as we know it they would be ashamed. What will be left for them to inherit? Slavery most likely. </p>
<p>It is tyranny. And we must resist!</p>

        <p>Your friends and family (and all of us) have been sold a bill of goods. It’s just that they don’t realize it, and we do for whatever reason. No amount of complying will satisfy the authoritarians. Once they reach a certain level of compliance, they simply move the goalposts.</p>

        <p>There was a song written in the early 60s about everyone being scared of bombs and war called "Let Me Die In My Footsteps" and it's about how you have to live your life and not be paranoid. Lots of the lines are super relevant to today:</p>
<p>"I will not go down under the ground because somebody tells me that death's coming around."</p>
<p>"The meaning of life has been lost in the wind."</p>
<p>"Some people are thinking that the end is close by. Instead of learning to live they're learning to die."</p>
<p>"There's always been people that have to cause fear."</p>

        <p>The media tend to speak for the older generations - making this whole thing about safeguarding the vulnerable. I have seen so many older people rebelling against the rules. Many of them think the restrictions are ridiculous and would rather die from Covid and allow the young people to get on with things and have opportunities, than the alternative of locking themselves away. My grandfather was a war hero in WW2 and he would be turning in his grave if he could see all the rights he fought for were being taken. That generation knew the meaning of sacrifice. Wearing a mask and obeying blinding is not a sacrifice worth making and is built on lies.</p>

        <p>Totally agree. Very well-said. I don't have kids yet but when I do one day, I'd feel horrible bringing them into the world if I knew I didn't do everything I could to fight against this.</p>

        <p>Funny how since the virus, lots of versions of that song have been taken down from Youtube. The few you can find, have comments disabled and none of his other songs do.</p>

        <p>Exactly this, I was thinking of posting something similar...</p>
<p>Everyone dies... but not everyone lives...</p>
<p>Allowing the the young to actually live life is more important in my mind than ruining their futures to give those that have already lived a full live, a few extra years maybe...</p>

        <p>Existence is minimum but living life should be the standard </p>
<p>Some countries believe you should work so you can live... not to just pay bills and die. Like there should be a larger point beyond working just to maintain survival. The trick is the elite begin with more money and opportunities so they naturally have more. Their connections are what keep them earning at higher levels.</p>
