<h2>TRANSCRIPT OF NOTABLE MOMENTS FROM STEVEN'S PRESENTATION</h2>
<p><strong>Duration of Steven Anderson’s Presentation [2:20:54 - 2:39:12]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[2:20:54] Beginning of Steven’s Presentation</strong>   <br>
-Steven introduces himself and the contents of the presentation.</p>
<p><strong>[2:23:10] Michael Katczynski (Meeting Facilitator):</strong>   <br>
“Dr. Anderson?” “Dr. Anderson, real quick. First off, if you don’t mind you can log out and log back into Adobe real quick so that way you can be back up — but also what slide are you on? ‘Cause — so I can make sure we’re on the right slide.”</p>
<p><strong>[2:23:36]</strong>   <br>
“[…] you can keep going; just make sure to tell us to advance slide.”   <br>
-Steven continues to present from Slide 2.</p>
<p><strong>[2:24:29]</strong> <strong>Steven:</strong> “I’m sorry this is Slide 6… I keep on forgetting to tell you that.”   <br>
-Steven remembers to let committee know when he begins slides 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 15.</p>
<p><strong>[2:31:35]</strong> Steven states he is on Slide 15.</p>
<p><strong>[2:33:16]</strong> <strong>After finishing Slide 15, Steven says:</strong> “Tom has a list of possible adverse event / outcomes of interest; I won’t dwell on this, he has them at the end of his presentation. So we’ll be coordinating which of these and others that we might be using in our rapid-cycle analyses, but it gives you appeal for the types of events — I’m sorry this is Slide 17.”</p>
<p><strong>[2:33:40] Pause Here to View Slide 16, or See Image 1.</strong>   <br>
-Steven skips Slide 16 and carries on with Slide 17.</p>
<p>-Slide 16 is the only slide that was skipped in full throughout Steven’s presentation.</p>
<p><strong>[2:39:12] Steven’s presentation ends</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong> Did Tom cover anything related to the contents of Slide 16 in his presentation? And if so, how much content from Slide 16 was mentioned in Tom’s presentation?</p>

<h2><strong>TRANSCRIPT OF NOTABLE MOMENTS FROM TOM'S PRESENTATION</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Duration of Tom Shimabukuro’s part of the presentation: [1:58:54 - 2:06:33]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[1:58:54] Beginning of Tom’s part of the presentation</strong>  <br>
-Tom introduces himself and the contents of the presentation.</p>
<p><strong>[1:59:58] Tom:</strong> “This is a list of systems and topics I will be covering.”
-VAERS, VSD, CISA, V-safe, Additional Covid-19 monitoring programs, Safety monitoring in pregnancy</p>
<p><strong>[2:03:01] Tom:</strong> “We also plan to monitor for vaccine-mediated enhanced disease in VSD.  <br>
-(1/22 topics covered from Slide 16)</p>
<p><strong>[2:05:43] Tom:</strong> “Vaccine Safety Datalink studies are planned to evaluate safety in pregnancy, fetal death, and infant outcomes  <br>
-(2/22 topics covered from Slide 16)</p>
<p><strong>[2:05:59]</strong> Tom gives a summary of the topics he has just covered, reading the slide word for word.</p>
<p><strong>[2:06:27]</strong> When he finishes reading, <strong>Tom continues to the next section of the presentation, which reads “Extra Vaccine Safety Slides” and skips the following 2 slides, which contain the list of adverse vaccine events.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[2:06:27] Tom:</strong> “And now I’m gonna turn things over to my colleague Dr. Schrag.”  <br>
<strong>[2:06:29] Pause Here for 1st skipped slide or See Image 2. <br>
[2:06:31] Pause Here for 2nd skipped slide or See Image 3.</strong></p>
<p>-The last 2 slides were the only slides that were skipped in full throughout Tom’s presentation.</p>
<p><strong>[2:06:33] End of Tom’s part of the presentation</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusions:</h2>
<p>-Tom and Steven both skipped their slides regarding the list of 22 known adverse effects of Covid-19 vaccines.   <br>
-The content matter of the slides in question had to have been known by both presenters since 10/22/2020. <br>
-Steven’s excuse for skipping the list is: “Tom [already] has a list of adverse vaccine events at the end of his presentation.”   <br>
-Tom skips the list of adverse vaccine events to introduce his colleague to present her slides.</p></p>

        <p>Here's some more info regarding this video. </p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-october-22-2020-meeting-announcement</p>
<p>The FDA has a bunch of documents at the bottom that contain all of the documents presented in the video.</p>
<p>https://www.fda.gov/media/143558/download Slide 22 shows risks for children and adults.</p>
<p>The PowerPoint slide shown in the video is here. https://www.fda.gov/media/143557/download</p>
<p>Edit: mods, I kind of feel this is something that should get pinned, to get eyes on it. It shows the FDA and CDC acknowledging low risk levels for children and adults, regarding COVID, as well as known risks/adverse reactions to the vaccines that were never made public or passed through to medical professionals.</p>
