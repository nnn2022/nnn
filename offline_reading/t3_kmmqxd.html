    <strong>Are there any of you here that started out by believing all this?</strong>
    <p><p>I won't lie. Back in January, I was terrified. I was scared for my mother, since she has respiratory issues. I was so, so miserable and worried sick about everything. I bought wholeheartedly into the fear.</p>
<p>As time went on, and the "two weeks to flatten the curve" turned into two months, I began to realize that this wasn't about the virus. I personally still don't know anyone who's gotten it- I've only heard about cases from other people. And I work in healthcare.</p>
<p>Now, I'm just tired and fed up with all this. I hate seeing people that continue to choose to live in fear, people that can't be bothered to take care of themselves and want to live off Daddy Government for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>I wish people would wake up and smell the coffee. All the people enforcing these lockdowns don't care about you. They don't care if you keel over and die in the street. This is about money and power, not about preserving life.</p></p>

        <p>Same. I knew from SARS / Zika / Swine Flu that it was all fearmongering drummed up by the CDC/WHO - ie, job security for those people. And then when Bill Gates started making TV appearances to guide his flock, I knew it was not just needless panic, but a massive psyop.</p>
<p>The only thing that surprised me this time around, is how swiftly everybody fell for it. I thought I could count on the usual disinterest / self-absorption of my fellow man, to shield us from a worldwide stampede.</p>
<p>Guess not.</p>

        <p>The difference this time was that this virus landed people on ventilators way more often even in the under 40 group. So they could FUD us much more easily by putting a picture of a 18 year old ballerina in the best shape of her life on a ventilator in front of us to terrify the usual person who could not reason out "Hey... she is the exception to the rule!"</p>

        <p>As did I.  My first reaction was "Caution, not fear" which caused a LOT of people on facebook to get pissed off at me and attack me- friends and family both.  So I started to look in on it because something at that point felt off.  And that's what led me down the rabbit hole that we are all at the bottom of now.</p>

        <p>Me too. I said to my wife, "This is a wealth grab." She obviously agreed. I woke her up in 2014 although it was pretty easy since she was disillusioned with <em>everything.</em> I started to wake up in 2005 researching 9/11. 2010 was the moment I finally got the hang of recognizing when someone was a controlled agent/misdirect personality and <em>truly</em> started thinking for myself. You get the hang of it after a while. The moment any of these personalities tell you a certain politician is going to save you and defeat "the globalist" that person is compromised. I saw it with Obama, and saw the exact same blind loyalty with Trump. People still think he's gonna save them. It's fucking sad....</p>

        <p>I played along until about mid April.</p>
<p>I actually remember in April I recommended to some people if this is a really serious respiratory, highly contagious novel virus, we should all definitely be wearing masks.  I was the first on my block to be wearing a mask.</p>
<p>I was ROUNDLY criticized and attacked.  Many people were yelling, "there is no scientific evidence supporting the use of masks".  Many people said I was a "science denier".</p>
<p>These are the same people who today are lecturing and yelling at people, to wear masks.</p>
<p>They are completely unaware of this contradiction.  They even continue their grandstanding without even a hint of embarrassment.</p>
<p>When the CDC and Dr. Fauci told us all to start wearing masks (after having said for weeks we don't need them), it was there I realized this is all a complete lie.</p>

I used to wear rubber gloves to the grocery store.  I wanted to protect my wife who has an autoimmune condition. Later on she got covid anyway and besides the loss of smell and taste it was a weak-ass cold for her.  I had mild congestion for 3 days.  I'd rather get covid again than to beta test a vaccine injection.</p>

        <p>I originally thought that Trump should just do a 2 week lockdown and get it over with. My leftist friends mocked me and said "Wow! So now Republicans are in favor of big government shutting down the entire country?".</p>
<p>When I realized that no one was collapsing in the streets like they showed in China, that no one I know has had it, or none of my friends know anyone, that the media constantly shit on treatment options - and MOST importantly, when the people that mocked me were losing their minds over it. That's when I knew it was BS.</p>
<p>It is so odd how the paradigm shifts.</p>

<p>I remember that very sentiment on the MSM and from the likes of Pelosi too... and how Trump was a racist for wanting to shut down air travel to the US from China.</p>
<p>Now Cuomo is pissing down his own leg wanting Trump to shut it down from the UK over this NeW sTrAiN!</p>
<p>Fuck Cuomo.  And fuck all the others that are now acting like this is AlL tRuMpS fAuLt.</p>

        <p>Trump was a racist on the China thing because he made it VERY clear that he was ONLY doing that because he disliked China and Chinese people.</p>
<p>Not because there was any higher risk since he was allowing Chinese people who came via Taiwan into the nation. Solely because of his own racist beliefs.</p>

        <p>Yes.  I believed it at first.  We stocked up on dry goods - flour, cornmeal, sugar, noodles, beans, rice, salt, spices in general.  We didn't hoard toilet paper though.</p>
<p>I planted a garden and replaced my annuals with vegetable plants.</p>
<p>We got a few more laying hens.</p>
<p>Had plans to butcher one of our own steers if it came down to it and if worse came to worse, we are some deer hunting and fishing fools at my house.</p>

        <p>Stocking up on dry and canned goods is a very good idea. I’m still doing it because they’ve consistently spouted from one empty head to the next that this will be a dark winter. Well it’s well within their means to make it so.</p>

        <p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>I also recommend rice.  You can keep the dry goods in a deep freeze indefinitely if you have one.  I also bought several whole hams and turkeys when they were stupid cheap a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Peanut butter is also something that'll last forever.  Honey.  Jam or jelly in a glass jar as opposed to a plastic squeeze bottle.  Maple and Karo syrup.</p>
<p>What's interesting is - I grew up with grandparents of the Can Do Generation.  They survived the Great Depression and WWII.  These are the things they kept in their pantry and freezer until they passed away in their 70s.  They also kept a garden - it was more modest with every year as they aged.  They did this their entire lives.  I'm glad they passed this on to me.  If it weren't for them, I'd have no idea how to plant a garden or get the most out of leftovers.</p>

        <p>Yes,  And I'm one of the more out-spoken contributors on this sub.</p>
<p>In the early days, March 2020, I certainly wanted to comply with business and government mandates.  I felt that we needed to protect one another and ourselves, in order to maintain order in hospitals, for real emergencies.  I'm never one to take undue risk, so, my thought was, if I can mitigate risk, I'll follow their guidance.</p>
<p>Come early May, the numbers were starting to come down.  I felt that we needed to re-open fully, but perhaps follow some guidelines on crowds and time spent among groups of unknown individuals.  Protect each other.  Still a good faith effort, but let's begin going back to normal.</p>
<p>Another month passed.  The riots of the summer began, and I was seeing millions of people torching businesses and causing outright destruction, for what appeared to be, a good time.  Sure, there was video of mask wearing criminals roaming the streets, and no one in government would reprimand them for their violence and destruction.  It was allowed to happen.  No social distancing orders were enforced, and city leaders, as pathetic as they are, just let it happen.  Yet, Store XYZ could not re-open.  Gyms were forced closed and remained there.  This fucking pissed me off.</p>
<p>So, in June, I started checking out on the whole pandemic story.  I refused to leave my home, if every city was enforcing rules on me and normal law-abiding citizens, yet allowing vigilantes to roam freely.  The powers that be lost me right then.  I checked out in June, then in July, decided I actually need to leave my home for my own sanity.  Alabama, the state I live in, and Florida, the state I travel to frequently, relaxed these supposed rules, and I relaxed as well.  </p>
<p>Since then, I do not entertain idiot politicians or authoritarians, and I avoid social media like the plague, which it is.  I don't participate, nor have I ever really, in any social justice movements or gatherings.  This sub came into being sometime later, and it supplanted my frequent contributions to r/Conservative.  I am a conservative minded person, but I also do NOT associate with any United States political party, as the largest two are both infested with power hungry whores.  Men and women alike.  They will all sell their souls to gain and keep power over all of us.  And they do not represent us.  Nor do they protect us.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading all that.  I am eternally grateful for this sub, and I'll do my part to keep it a civil and mindful place.</p>

        <p>The reaction to the riots was vile. I think one of the straws that broke the camel's back for me was everyone celebrating Biden's win. The front page of Reddit was filled with pictures of thousands of people hugging, kissing, and sharing bottles of champagne. And those same people who have been screaming at us for months didn't let out a peep about those crowds.</p>
<p>It's blatant hypocrisy. You'd have to be an idiot to not see through it.</p>

        <p>I believed the narrative at first too. My boyfriend is a "conspiracy theorist" and he saw through it right away, but I didn't agree with him. I wanted to give it time to play out and see what would happen. He was right from the beginning. Once I started seeing the numbers, and figuring out that I only knew a few people who had even contracted it, I saw through it pretty clearly. When you read the supporting information for the other side it becomes pretty obvious if you are willing to have an open mind and consider the other point of view.</p>

        <p>I was a bit scared at the beginning yeah. My mom and dad got sick, lost their taste etc. I begged them to get tested (my mom has heart problems) they refused. They were in bed for a couple of days and then they were fine. Then I got it, I have to be fair, the breathing difficulties weren't fun. I was scared I had to go to the hospital. I coukd not even stand up for too long (heakthy 33 yr old woman) It took me 2 weeks to get better.
I have seen clients die (Im a nurse) and colleagues being sick for months and months on end.</p>
<p>But realised, it is a small minority. If I turn off the tv and look around, people aren't dropping dead in the streets, my work is the same as always, some people die, most people live. Most colleagues who got it had a runny nose for a few days and a lot were asymptomatic. It is a virus, it is here and we have to learn to live with it and protect the old and weak people. But not by masks, lockdowns, closing schools and ruining bussinesses. </p>
<p>Most of the news is fake and just on tv to scare us into compliance. Yeah the virus sucks but we can't hide away in fear forever. Tackle it, learn how to treat it and move on with our lives.</p>

        <p>I was a little scared for the first two weeks, but I still went out for bike rides while most people I know literally locked themselves inside. This was in March; it wasn't on my radar in Jan/Feb.</p>

        <p>I was so distraught that I had to take a week off work back in March.</p>
<p>I stopped taking this "pandemic" seriously when it became acceptable to riot in the cities because a black criminal died of a fentanyl overdose and they made a martyr out of him.</p>

        <p>I was more worried that I was going to get an automatic two week quarantine somehow, so I went out and filled my cabinets, fridge, and freezer with food. I did not buy a 50 pack of tp or paper towels or all the cleaning supplies. I have done zero extra cleaning since this started. </p>
<p>I realized it was all bs with the masks don't work/masks are mandatory flip flop. I was angry as all hell when protesters were super spreaders and BLM protesters were heroes. </p>
<p>I saw the vaccine push coming a mile away. I had hope they wouldn't rush it. Joke's on me. </p>
<p>And then I made myself calm down because I realized this was going to carry on from a few years to forever.</p>

        <p>Yeah, and this is going to turn into a bit of rant but I bought into it very briefly when I saw people collapsing in the street in China. Didn’t take long to see through the bullshit though. </p>
<p>I work in private healthcare and have 100s of clients. We’ve had only a handful of our clients test positive for Covid and not one employee.</p>
<p>One of our clients is morbidly obese in his 80s, diabetes, heart problems, dementia and practically bed ridden, he had covid and I swear to fucking god he looked better than ever after ‘surviving’ this deadly disease. Another client in his 90s had zero symptoms. Full recovery. The only one death from ‘COVID’ and it’s such a joke that it’s even classed as covid. A 95 year old lady, been on end of life since she came out of hospital 9 months before. An absolute miracle that she was still alive after all that time. Several strokes, multiple chest infections, completely bed bound etc, The final chest infection that finally put her out of her misery was classed as a covid death,  without even testing. </p>
<p>A family friend who’s dad found out he had bone cancer in March, they gave him several months to live. He made it to the end of November. While he was on his last legs he miraculously tested positive for covid. Another covid statistic. He also had treatments/tests delayed because of lockdowns.</p>
<p>I can only imagine how this is happening over and over and over and OVER again. And yet nobody questions anything. There is not one single colleague that I could confidently talk to about any of this. I don’t even try anymore to have discussions about how all this is bullshit. People do not want to hear it. They do not want to see it. They do not want to believe it. They only want to believe what the media tells them to believe. </p>
<p>That scares me MUCH more than a virus with a 99.7% survival rate.</p>

        <p>I believed it. The thing is we had superspread events during the outbreak in Feb/March so cases skyrocketed and it is was all 'new'. Im hiv-positive so I didn't know how wuflu would react with that. I was scared and the media didn't help with that. </p>
<p>I stopped believing when they announced the lockdown light halfway October with minimal cases.  </p>
<p>I couldn't believe our MP would destroy the economy for only minimal cases. We knew at this point it was just a worse flu. So I stopped believing in the bs.</p>

<p>Hearing your account gives me hope though. You can fool some people, some of the time. You can't everyone all of the time though. </p>
<p>I think the majority of people around the world actually align with this sub's mentality but censorship and isolation make it appear otherwise. Not to mention, the screechy tattletales of society (always a minority) have been given soapboxes to shout their virtue signaling garbage and make it seem like a there is consensus.</p>

        <p>I used to be one of those doomers on r/wuhan_flu who thought it was going to be the end of the world. But right after these hypocritical politicians started breaking the law (executive branch making laws is illegal) and breaking their mandates, as well as seeing the insanely low death rate of this virus I realized these lockdowns were just an excuse for near-unlimited Government power. Before you ask where are my posts on Wuhan_Flu, I made a new account (this one) during the transition from doomer to anti-lockdown/mask.</p>

        <p>I'm gonna keep it 100% as I always try to do on here, at the beginning I was shit scared not knowing what was going on (before researching, being sent to work from home in March and listening to the MSM), after reading more about it in about June and knowing what's going on and speaking to a friend who has a biology degree and has worked in a respiratory ward ICU to confirm all the things that I had read and about the PCR test, my mind was at ease and upon finding the subreddits and more information on the topic it has helped me find out it's not really about health but more about a shift of power</p>

        <p>I was very concerned before the mainstream media told me to be concerned. Now, people call me an asshole. I won’t wear a mask. If I’m sick, I stay home until I feel better. I’ve been mindful of hand washing and sanitation before it was cool but I’m not playing along with this bullshit.</p>

        <p>Yes. I was freaking out when I saw the outbreak in China. I quit a small part time job right before the shut down and went out of the city to stay in a rural area with my boyfriend. I eventually quit my job at an urgent care because their "lack of PPE". My second urgent care job (I got without an interview, without applying) was corporate bullshit. The PAs didn't care about masks and it was just daily changes from higher ups to accommodate patients fears and fuck us over. The PAs knew quickly the numbers were lower than expected and I got out because my higher ups just worked us ragged. But thank goodness we got a red "were heroes" shirts. I'll just say it Fuck Beaumont.</p>

        <p>I believed. I stored some food and yes, toilet paper (only 2 small packets but still!), bought some disinfectant, at work I cleaned the keyboards and door knobs several times a day, stopped going to the cafeteria etc. But I was done with it very quickly. I mean nothing happened. During the spring approximately 400 people died in my country of 5,5 million people, median age 84 and living in nursing homes. Ok, then came summer and the bars and restaurants opened again and nothing, few people got sick, practically no patients in hospitals. Then in the autumn schools started, nothing happened.  Somebody got the idea we should wear masks, many started to, I didn't, just don't see the point. After that some fluctuation, when the winter started some more people hospitalized which is normal, cold weather and dry air from central heating makes your respiratory system weaker and people just stop going outside where it is dark and cold and wet. New restrictions. But still nothing special. I mean since the spring approximately 200 people dead. Median age still 84. Many, many headlines screaming about  infections and exposures in schools, in public transport, in amusement parks...but nothing. No young and healthy people getting sick. Still not a single friend, relative, or acquaintance has got sick of covid. And I live in the covid hotspot of my country. I just don't care. I mean I HATE the restrictions and masks (which I don't use), but this covid thing, it's nothing. During 9 months this disease has killed 600 people, about the same number influenza killan every single year. I wouldn't even know anything of this raging pandemic if I didn't read the news.</p>

        <p>I didn't believe in it from the start. I knew from day one that asking EVERYONE to masks and EVERYONE to lockdown was stupid and counterproductive.</p>
<p>My mother believed it was reasonable at first but she was starting to get annoyed with it in the last few weeks before Dad brought home "The gift that keeps on killing" from the rehab center due to the negligence of the rehab center.</p>
<p>In late April she was going "It has been more than 2 weeks... if the lockdowns were going to work, they would have worked by now!"</p>
<p>I think if she was still alive right now, she like me would be horrified at what is going on.</p>

        <p>From the beginning, I felt like it wasn't that BIG of a deal (I wanted to go on a cruise I planned and paid for) and felt like something fishy was going on. Never thought this mess would last so long. I didn't care because I take precautions to avoid getting sick anyway so didn't think it'd be much different</p>

        <p>I did. I prepared. I bought n95, food, water and was ready to hunker down. I still do, to a degree. I am lucky enough to to have my grandparents around and while I’m positive this has been overblown I don’t want to risk them. But it is a fact that they are using this virus with an agenda. Pick your poison. Hide the unavoidable economic collapse, pass tighter laws to control population, take down Trump, topple governments... the moment they went back and forth with the masks... the moment they backed up the incompetent fuck that is Tedros... the moment that they said a fucking bandana over your face could save you... the moment they forced you to close your business but didn’t put a stop to loan payments, banks charging interest, and mega corporations using tax money to “bail out” fat CEOs that were social distancing in yatchs... it all drove me a bit crazy. I still know this virus is around. That you could get it bad. That the sick fucks that rule us could be crazy enough to spread a bio weapon and hide a power grab. I dunno man.</p>

        <p>Yes, I was in a completely opposite mindset. You ever see "doomsday preppers"? Well that shit was me. I was one step away from buying a $1200 PAPR respirator unit. My normal stance is I don't trust government and it appeared in the beginning that they were downplaying or ignoring it. When Fauci said "no need to wear masks", I was convinced that I MUST wear a mask. Everyone I knew said "it won't come here. It'll stay in China" and I was like "you'll see".  </p>
<p>But I now think the videos from China were a psyop, purposely put there for us to think it was way worse. I must say, it worked. They knew people didn't trust government so they just stood back and said almost nothing while "leaking" horrific videos from China. </p>
<p>I actually joined Reddit for the first time just to get info on the pandemic. I thought the government was hiding info.</p>

        <p>Yes. I was completely sucked in. But not from the mainstream media. No, infact it was from listening to alternative media like, Lisa Haven and Alex Jones who were pushing the “China bad, China released bio weapons to kill Americans“ narrative. As well as prominent preppers going “we told you so!! Who’s laughing at who now!!” </p>
<p>Once I realized that the CNN narrative of people dropping dead in the streets and being loaded into morgue trucks, didn’t equate to real life.</p>
<p>As well as the alternative media narrative coming from people like Gene Decode, CirstenW and Linda Paris, that they were using a phony  virus to, arrest paedophile celebrities and saving children was also a massive fake nothing burger...... Then, I quickly realized it was ALL fake!!!!</p>

        <p>I did a bit at first. Stocked up on some supplies and bought some pretty expensive respirators. It became apparent pretty fast that a lot of this virus shit was political; going to do stuff with friends and family was frowned upon, but rioting, burning and looting was just fine. Then the fatality rate turned out to be pretty low for healthy people. I feel like an idiot for ever buying into any of it in the first place.</p>

        <p>I was very scared starting in late January up until about the end of April. By then, enough data had accumulated to show that the virus was very weak and only those who are very old and/or very sick are susceptible. From then on, we went back to as much normal as our shithole government has allowed.</p>

        <p>I was skeptical from the get go, but then I discovered videos from Wuhan of overwhelmed nurses absolutely breaking down into tears. I admit I bought into those videos for a while and thought maybe we should proceed with caution.</p>

        <p>January and February I assumed this was going to be another Ebola, we hear about for a week or two and it vanishes and we never hear about it again. March and April, I figured this is a bad virus but thought the measures were a little extreme. I figured it would just have to be something we get through, never expected it to get to this level of paranoia. Come may and the George Floyd protests, I was over it because we had people gathering in the millions and not the amount of deaths to back up as deadly as they were making this out to be.</p>

        <p>I took it seriously in late February back before anyone cared.  I'd share the news about what was happening in China and got the typical normie reaction of "wow, that's crazy.  <em>drool</em>"  However, I was never truly afraid... I was being pretty practical in the event that it turned out to be even worse than we thought.</p>
<p>Then over the next 2 months I pretty quickly figured out that the reaction over the virus was complete nonsense and that it's one big globalist psy-op.  Now I constantly eat food with my hands hoping I'll get the virus so I'll improve my immune system without being genetically engineered by big pharma.</p>

        <p>I’m against lockdowns and I hate the term NEW NORMAL. But when people see stuff like Keyontae Johnson (supposed heart issues from covid), Jeremih (on vent), Cody Garbrandt (blood clots) and Luke Letlow (died at 41) you can understand why some people are afraid. The media drums up panic porn and people wonder how to explain all these instances</p>

        <p>I've never been worried about it. I saw people freaking out for one reason or another, then when they locked down my state we had like 3 cases in our county (a county of 720,000, mind you), I thought it was a bit ridiculous; then they stayed locked down and I started getting pissed at the blatant statism.</p>

        <p>I was kind of concerned back in March because I have several high risk family members who are elderly and/or already have weak/compromised immune systems...but it became clear almost immediately that this was going to be exactly what it is now...everybody sacrificing a year of their lives, their ability to financially support themselves, their mental health, with no clear end in sight...meanwhile everybody who already had no life prior to the "pandemic" gets a fun little excuse to not have to get off their butt, get a job, take care of themselves, or interact with their "loved ones," and gets to look down on everybody who does for a change.</p>
