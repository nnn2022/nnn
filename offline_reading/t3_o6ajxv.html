        <p>Translation:</p>
<p>Theater and film actor Yegor Beroev spoke on June 22 at the TEFI - Chronicle of Victory television award ceremony in defense of people who had not been vaccinated against coronavirus. During the speech, a yellow star was attached to the lapel of Beroev's jacket, similar to those that the Nazis forced to Jews wear  as distinctive symbols.</p>
<p>Beroev said that he was not vaccinated against coronavirus and in recent days he feels that he lives in a world where vaccination "has become an identification mark." The actor, recalling the struggle of the Soviet people against fascism, urged to prevent the division of people into vaccinated and unvaccinated.</p>
<p>I want to say today about what worries me in the last two days. I've heard some here have already spoken out on this. I want to tell you that I have not been vaccinated against the coronavirus. And some of my friends were vaccinated. And even friends were vaccinated. This has never been the reason for our quarrels and disputes. We are adults, we respect each other's choices. You know: "My body is my business . "</p>
<p>But today I woke up in a world where it has become an identification mark: are you a citizen or will you be on a reservation, will you be able to visit institutions and events, will you enjoy all the rights and benefits. I have a question: how could we, the descendants of the winners, allow this? ( Applause. )</p>
<p>I want to say that no human life, dignity can be sacrificed for the public good. It is written in blood in the Nuremberg Codex . Man is inseparable from his dignity and freedom of choice. Even if you do not like this choice and you wish him exclusively well.</p>
<p>I ask you, dear, those present here, friends, colleagues, do not allow the separation of us with you, do not allow enmity between us, do not allow the segregation of society into smart and stupid, people with Down syndrome and without, white and black, Jews and non-Jews, vaccinated and unvaccinated. It already happened once. And our grandfathers paid in blood to prevent this from happening again. ( Applause. )</p>
<p>Due to the increase in the number of cases of covid in Moscow  , mandatory vaccination  against coronavirus has been introduced - most employees in the service sectors, education, transport, housing and communal services, as well as civil servants must get vaccinated. In the future, compulsory vaccination was announced in a number of other regions of Russia.</p>

        <p>Quite disappointed to hear Russia has moved to a mandatory vaccine stance. Kudos to this guy for his solidarity.</p>
