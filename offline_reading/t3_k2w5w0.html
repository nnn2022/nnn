    <strong>I feel exhasperated, lost all respect for my family.</strong>
    <p><p>I can't post anywhere else on Reddit regarding covid matters for obvious reasons, and I seriously need to vent at the moment. The current situation feels surreal and it's like my environment is trying to make me look like I'm delusional.</p>
<p>For context, I'm not american, so this whole story is unrelated to any event going on over there in terms of news, and I apologise for the wording if something's messy.</p>
<p>I've always respected my parents for who they are. But it turns out the pandemic has got them acting strange, one could say they became doomers, same as my brother. </p>
<p>I never minded having the TV turned on during meals because I didn't give a damn about the news and my parents liked having it on.</p>
<p>But today I hit a tipping point and it's infuriating for me to keep on listening to the news any longer. All they do is spread fear, alter the narrative so it fits the interests of those who own the news channels and make people reject opposing viewpoints to those of the media.</p>
<p>Politely discussing this matter with my family, they tell me they know it's not all true but "it's good to stay informed". Then they proceed to keep on watching the news every lunch and dinner like they're hypnotized and they can't see past the lies in the headings. My mom specially will accept any news she reads online as universal truths, and she's convinced we're going to have to wear masks for life from now on and accepts it. </p>
<p>My dad has all sorts of background conditions that make him vulnerable and asks my brother and I for responsability at school and outside but then he won't take any care of himself. He says I give him anxiety by discussing these topics with him and he overeats as a result. Unbelievable emotional blackmail. </p>
<p>Tonight I told my parents I would be having dinner at another time from now on so if they want to watch the news they would do it by themselves, and I would get to have dinner in peace, by myself, with no man in a screen telling me to be afraid. They reacted as if I had admitted I had killed somebody and went on about how I was too radical and it was unacceptable for me to do so, they went as far as to call me a <em>nazi</em>, a <em>nazi</em> for wanting to have the TV off because it gets me mad. They also said I would be having lots of trouble later in life making friends because I am too extreme.</p>
<p>I have no words to describe how powerless and frustrated I feel now. My family won't question their mentality and they make me feel like I'm a lunatic every meal when I point out something on TV is not true and they are getting their "news" from a corrupt source.</p>
<p>It all seems so negative in my environment. Not to bring up how hard it's become for me to follow the current school year half of the days at home, sitting in front of a screen, all because of a stupid virus that has suddenly made people act like they have no basic reasoning capacities and they want to be fed with fear porn.</p>
<p>I seriously don't think I can make it much longer this way, and I'm hoping there's a turning point on the current situation sometime soon because I feel myself weak, sad and not willing to try in any activity.</p>
<p>Have a good one.</p></p>

        <p>Scared people are the worst. If your parents are doomers you need to not be around them as much as possible. Let them be scared on their own. It's a pathetic and sad way to live and I've seen this among many unhealthy people in their 50s and 60s they are terrified of death and now live life as Covid shutins pushing the heaviest fear of any group out there.</p>

        <p>I feel the same way. I get angry at these no-name “experts” on TV, too. Even though you might seem alone, because most of us do, there are more people like you and I. </p>
<p>My parents have never called me a nazi, but I’m the most anti-mask anti-lockdown person in my household. </p>
<p>I don’t even wear the masks when I go to malls and stores. I’m too fucking frustrated with this isolation to listen to their rules. I’m tired of feeling like a worthless, suicidal, lonely ugly loser when I never felt like this 10 months ago. This isn’t something we should have to get used to.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be required to hide our faces and smiles behind a face diaper. I shouldn’t have to stay 6 feet away from other human beings like I’m some disgusting plague rat. </p>
<p>I shouldn’t have to go out-of-state to find a public area that isn’t closed just so I can meet other people my age. </p>
<p>I should have the ability to go to in-person school/college to make new connections and get into my first relationships. </p>
<p>I’m more afraid of losing my basic human rights than dying to a glorified common cold with a 99.9% survival rate.</p>
<p>If these people felt empathy or cared about our ‘safety’, their first decision wouldn’t have been to lock us up in isolated prison cells for 10 months. </p>
<p>You didn’t cause this, and you don’t deserve to go through any of it. Regardless of what anyone else says, you have every right in the world to be angry and frustrated. If you didn’t let that emotion out, you’d take it out on yourself.</p>
<p>All we can do now is document our experiences and hope for the future. Don’t let the world drive you crazy. You’re still here with us for a reason, I hope you stay strong and pull through it.</p>

        <p>Man I recognize you from a post I made earlier this month and once again I fully agree with all you said.</p>
<p>The "experts" talk was exactly what started the argument today at dinner, as I was trying to make my parents see those guys were not even going to say anything bad against vaccinations because they were paid to agree with the narrative of the news channel my parents seem to be so drawn at.</p>
<p>It's like everyone, at the same time, went crazy overnight and I feel like I'm being gaslighted and pushed to think I'm a crazy conspiracy theorist. I'm just one other guy who wants his freedoms back and I don't think that's too selfish for me to say.</p>
<p>I'm almost 18, just trying to get the best out of life, but these past months have been horrible at another level. I've always looked at suicide like something I wouldn't ever even consider and repressed any suicidal thoughts I had, but I've questioned it several times over the past couple of months, and I still am feeling like crap because it's like I'm enslaved over something I'm not even responsable for.</p>
<p>Wish I had the balls you have to go around town with no mask on, here were I live it's mandatory plus my dad's always being a selfish asshole and he says if he dies from the disease it'll be my fault for being irresponsible, lol.</p>
<p>About dating, omg I often try to ignore it when those thoughts come to me because the situation's just depressing. I finally built character in quarantine and tried to become more confident and exercie and when I finally think I have a chance to go out and meet chicks, boom, we all got diapers on our face and there's no way to get to know people because they're all secluded in their own circle, unwilling to open up to others and man, you can't see people's faces, they can't see yours. No chance for me.</p>
<p>At this point I wish I could be swallowed by a black hole and end my life fast and without pain, recently it's become a chore to even do schoolwork because I'm so demotivated and my social life is non existent.</p>
<p>We people on here should stick together and I wish you the best partner, this is one very awful time and I hope it's over soon so we both can go about our lives normally.</p>

        <p>If anyone straight up tells you that, "if I die from the virus, it's all your fault for being irresponsible!" They are a complete asshole! Never have I ever seen this bullshit from any other sickness. If I get the flu or a cold, I don't sit there and think, "What murderer gave me this? I must look at the people I was around over the last year, so I can blame someone!" This is such an utter sham!</p>

<p>You need to flip this attitude around!!</p>
<p>With masks it's easier than ever to approach girls. First, way less competition (most guys are too scared, just like you). Second, if they reject you, who cares, they never saw your face.</p>

        <p>You're not alone. Unfortunately, because of this mass-madness, we're all being forcibly isolated and made to FEEL we're alone. That's the most frustrating and fucked-up part.</p>
<p>&rt;because they were paid to agree with the narrative of the news channel</p>
<p><em>"It is difficult to get a man to understand a thing, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it." - Upton Sinclair</em></p>
<p>Funny story, I told my mom that quote recently (in the context of the media not being trustworthy, and always having an agenda) and she claimed it was so just brilliant and true! The next day? Right back to her fear porn, believing everything on TV. Some people will never leave that bubble, there's nothing you can do.</p>
<p>I don't have any great advice, but maybe this whole shitty ordeal we're all going through is a lesson in "live and let live". We don't all have to have the same opinions or worldviews or perceptions. Why can't we just agree to disagree, choose to see things our own way? Obviously that's a lot easier said than done, when other people want to outlaw everything we've come to know as human existence. I don't have any answers for THAT.</p>
<p>But at least in your personal, home environment, maybe just experiment with "look, I'm not going to push my opinions on you, but I ask for the same respect and consideration in return. We'll just silently understand that this is a hot-button topic that we will NEVER agree on, and find other, more pleasant, completely unrelated things to talk about, so we can be a family again." Maybe a bit too optimistic but it's worth a shot, no?</p>
<p>re: your dad trying to put his death upon you - just shrug it off, and KNOW internally that NO, you're not responsible for him in any way. HE can go to the grave believing he's a martyr, but that's his personal baggage / creation. Nobody can make you feel guilty about anything if you don't internalize it and agree with them.</p>

I’m tired of feeling like a worthless, suicidal, lonely ugly loser when I never felt like this 10 months ago. This isn’t something we should have to get used to.</p>
<p>Because of this, a state needed a lockdown. 
If everybody would have wore a mask and distance themselves, we wouldnt have needed a lockdown. We wouldnt need to stayed at home and get depressiv.
Look at Korea, China, Japan etc. Look at other countries who didnt needed a lockdown or not a long one. Why? Cause they just wore a fucking mask and distance themselves. Giving up a little freedom in the beginning would have given us more freedom now. Paradox i know.</p>
<p>&rt;I shouldn’t have to go out-of-state to find a public area that isn’t closed just so I can meet other people my age.</p>
<p>U are not alone. If everybody had just do there fucking Job Nobody had to do this.</p>

<p>LOL. I know that sort of thing isn't funny when you're stuck with the people who say it, but it is 100% as ridiculous as it sounds to you.</p>
<p>How old are you? Will moving out be a possibility any time soon?</p>

        <p>I would definitely recommend finishing high school before you try to leave. But after that, have you considered going into a trade rather than going immediately to college? A lot of people try to stigmatize blue-collar work, but it can be a much faster route to financial independence, and it doesn't stop you from going back to school a few years down the line if you want a career change.</p>
<p>I only ask because your family situation reminds me of mine, and looking back I wish I had been aware of more options for getting out of there sooner.</p>

        <p>I can't speak to your situation specifically, but I left home a month after turning 18, still in high school. I did this because I couldn't live on my parent's terms anymore.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have a friend's parents let me stay there rent free till I graduated then charged a very reasonable amount after I graduated and got a job.</p>
<p>Have not moved home since, and gave certainly had my sketchy moments where I was sure how I could survive another month, but I never moved back. </p>
<p>Its been about 20 years since then and am grateful for the decision to leave asap. I look at some of my friends who still live at home in their 30s and have no motivation or life skills.</p>
<p>I guess I'm just saying, that you can probably find a way out, but I won't promise its easy at your age.</p>

        <p>It's not narcissistic if it's true. My family is a bunch of dumb narcissists, and if I spend enough time around them I start to feel that I'm the dumb narcissist. No Idea how that works. Hope you can become completely Infependent of them one day. Sounds like they're holding you back.</p>

        <p>I feel like they're a burden on many aspects if I'm being honest. They're always judging others over the smallest things, my dad always resorts to humor as a way to avoid facing reality as it is and they often tell me to shut up and obey them when I present them with logical arguments discussing covid and other matters during meals.</p>
<p>I try to get myself to like them because I know it's a long way until I gain financial independence and move out (I'm 17) but they're some of the most illogical people I've ever met.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that. I know what it's like to be the black sheep. You and I must be sister souls. That's exactly how I feel about my family. It's like talking to a bunch of soulless robots. It sounds like they don't have the imagination to empathize with others, or the wisdom to realize that you might know something they don't. You ever wondered if they're narcissists?</p>

        <p>I know for sure my mom things very highly of herself, apart from being very judgemental and she always takes an egocentric approach to things, I'd say if someone in my family is, then it's her.</p>
<p>My dad is quite in love with her and I believe his love brainwashes him. I'm sure he's not that bad of a guyz but he can't disagree with my mom and sometimes he'll be very authoritarian and try to impide what he thinks over what any of us might think.</p>
<p>I think overall the thing is they're too afraid of someone telling them they're wrong and they can't accept realities that don't allign with their own beliefs. They're already too deep into their ego.</p>

        <p>That's a shame. I don't understand what went wrong with the older generations. If I had kids I'd love to hear what they think about politics. Especially if they disagreed with me. Careful around those people. My family robbed me of all my confidence and it's taken a long time to get it back. Stay strong and keep reminding yourself that you know what you're talking about and they don't.</p>
<p>Edit: btw judgemental behavior is a strong indicator for narcissism.</p>

        <p>These are such divisive times. I have MSM consuming doomer parents myself. They can't see past it even if they'll acknowledge individual facts that aren't part of that narrative. I sincerely think the only high road is to be compassionate with them and with ourselves. They can't help it. Be grateful for your critical thinking skills. Many don't have them or don't care. Your a special thinker. Think of what behavior to your family will make you feel like a good person when you look back on these trying times. You will find it eases your mind to do that rather than challenge them and cause defensiveness. There are ways to talk about it with people though. Try framing your thoughts as musings or asking them questions. It will help get their gears turning instead of turning them opposite you. Good luck!</p>

<p>It sounds harsh and they may be lovely people regularly, but I honestly can't respect them (just going off of what you've told me) either. Especially seeing that they know how bad this is affecting you and they still slavishly follow the dictates of their new abnormal overlords.</p>
<p>BTW, the fact that they would call you that has nothing to do with national socialism, its practice in Germany or its followers. It's literally the term de jour for "heretic." A thought-terminating cliche that lets you not only disregard whatever the source has to say, but place them in the "mindless evil unworthy of any consideration" box.</p>

        <p>Oh man I went through the post you linked and you're not precisely in a good spot either for what I see!</p>
<p>Yeah, my parents are usually acceptable people but covid hysteria has got to them and they showed their true selves in this situation. It's just so hard to keep going knowing the people I have held the dearest for all my life have gone nuts overnight, and they think I'm the one that's a looney. </p>
<p>About what they called me, they throw around these terms like "authoritarian" or "radical" very frequently so I don't even care anymore, it just shows they're scared of what I have to say because it doesn't allign with their views.</p>
<p>All the best for the situation you're going through pal, and I hope the whole plandemic is over soon enough.</p>

        <p>Don't try to retrain your parents, they're way too old to learn new ways at that age. Do yourself a favor and focus on yourself. It might sound jaded but it is what it is.</p>
<p>I haven't watched tv for a decade now. Never regretted that decision.</p>

        <p>Your parents place their trust in celebrity.</p>
<p>This is common.</p>
<p>You might not think of news as famous, but the anchors are celebrities to your folks. Whatever is popular and mainstream will get their trust. No amount of facts or rational arguments can sway someone, when the most important thing is WHO says it. Knowing this, you can talk with them differently in the future. Usually comedy is the best means to communicate your points.</p>

        <p>I feel the same around my own, the person that I really can hold such a conversation with anymore is my younger brother. The rest of the time, it denigrated into arguments. </p>
<p>My advice, just don't eat dinner with them and see what happens. I haven't eaten any dinners with the TV on and can't be bothered to listen to the news. It probably helps that the language it is in is the second language that I don't speak a lot anymore. </p>
<p>If not, then you just point it out and make it so that even they give up on trying to get you to eat unless they want to argue the whole way.</p>

        <p>When they call you a Nazi, just realize that it’s pure projection.</p>
<p>The sorts of things we are seeing, particularly with regard to people not only slavishly following the arbitrary diktats, but actively trying to force others to follow those diktats, are <em>exactly</em> analogous to those who’ve enabled virtually every oppressive regime in recorded history.</p>
<p>The atrocities of the Nazis and of virtually every other self-professed socialist government were only possible because of people like your parents.</p>
<p>The atrocities committed in these United States, particularly in relation to slavery, the American Indians, and to blacks since the end of slavery, are all examples of atrocities being enabled by people who refuse to speak out due to fear.</p>
<p>By speaking out against the current wave of arbitrary government oppression, you’re not being a Nazi—You’re being the sort of activist who will eventually be spoken of with the reverence that is currently reserved for groups like the abolitionists of the 1850s, and civil rights campaigners of the 1950s.</p>
<p>People like your parents, by contrast, will be remembered as the hateful bigots that they are, akin to the hateful bigots who used brutal violence to fight to retain slavery and segregation.</p>

        <p>One idea for you:</p>
<p>If they want to watch the news together so badly while eating, ask for every 4th night (1/4 family members?) that you get to choose the station. OANN</p>

        <p>I'm in a similar situation and I'll tell you something that helps me when I feel isolated like this: I listen to a long podcast on youtube/bitchute (usually on the topic of alternative health and healing) with people who are aware, open minded and full of positive energy.</p>
<p>Here's two great talks I heard recently:</p>
<p>Kelly Brogan on Alfa Vedic</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT1Ef-1gpzs&amp;t=5131s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT1Ef-1gpzs&amp;t=5131s</a></p>
<p>Eileen Day Mckusick, Andrew Kaufman</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLIxBRaL0ZE&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLIxBRaL0ZE&amp;t=1s</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>These and others helped me a lot, not just because I find the topic interesting; I feel like I've more in common with them than most people around me and so that's really important at the moment.</p>
<p>Hope your situation improves soon. All the best.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry for your situation with your parents. It seems like maybe the only thing to do is detach yourself from them, spend as little time with them as possible if all they’re going to do is gaslight and blackmail you. </p>
<p>I’ve completely cut off my family and friends who are terrified of this virus and think that we need a much more serious lockdown. I’m happier without their constant love for permanent lockdowns and wishes for death on anyone who thinks differently.</p>

        <p>I feel you. With my parents, my mom is completely paranoid, but she doesn't really bring it up because she knows that we'll just fight. My dad, who knows. One day he'll be agreeing with me that this is BS, the next, he'll be completely supportive of it and sound just like those people who say "It's for everyone's safety." He changes all the time. I have lost respect for a few friends as well. And I'm sure they've probably lost respect for me. But that's okay. I'd rather have a few of the right friends than a lot of the wrong ones. I know this sounds cliché, but try not to pay it any mind. You know in your heart what your opinions are.</p>
