        <p>Oh yeah dude, I completely agree and sorry for my sarcasm, it's the only way I can cope with this bullshit scamdemic... I can't imagine a 99% reduction in the flu, it's seasonal and will make it's rounds every damn season, they just aren't keeping track of it and any sniffle or cough even if suspected or tested 'positive' is marked as corona</p>

        <p>I knew you were being sarcastic but I was still responding to the doomer answer. How does that make sense to them as being a reasonable answer? I don't think people are being shady with flu tests and I've seen evidence in multiple locations that they're still running the same number of flu tests. I think for whatever reason people that would have the flu bad enough to be tested for it got covid instead.</p>

        <p>I don't think there is any justification no matter how it's spun to have a valid answer to that question... I do think they are running flu tests but I don't think they are being honest with the reporting of the flu, maybe if a person tests positive for both, they just list it as corona and not flu?</p>

        <p>Also due to people not getting doctors appointments for confirmation. If you feel ill, they just tell you to stay home and rest. I’ve tried taking my baby to the doctor and they told me that it’s emergencies only, as if I wouldn’t take him to the hospital for emergencies.</p>

        <p>Well, the flu cases are compared to last year when there was no social distancing or masks, thus the drop.  However, the flu is still spreading because of people who aren't following safe practices, just like COVID.</p>

        <p>Both can be true, that people are masking and distancing yet covid is spreading, because it was already too late to totally stop the spread when everyone started taking it seriously. The fact that it is a pandemic basically means anyone could reasonably have it, so a lot of people are getting it from within their small bubble after one person made a mistake.</p>
<p>Whereas the flu didn't have many hosts by the time lock downs and mask usage were common place, so it didn't really have a chance to spread.</p>

        <p>Couldn't be to do with the fact that a large amount of the people who would get flu have either died are dying, have covid  or are distancing. Or maybe they aren't going to get a flu test because they are worried about covid.</p>
<p>It will take alot to convince people that you and this sub are right. Because most people have brains.</p>

        <p>Wouldn't the simplest answer be that it isn't a hoax?</p>
<p>I work as a IT tech in a hospital and if you had any idea how much money and time this is costing the hospital. How many wards have been moved to make way for covid wards. How much ppe has been bought and how many staff are now working remotely from home. With brand new laptops and an overworked server linking them all back to us. The idea that they are labelling non covid deaths as covid deaths is just so ridiculous when you think about the damage it's doing to the economy aswell as the damage it's doing to the hospitals. You think the rich execs that run the hospitals are happy their money is being spent? That they would gladly spend it all away on covid wards and hundreds of £1500 laptops for staff that will eventually be coming back and returning the laptops. Which will then never get used again?. It's counter intuitive.</p>

<p>This is exactly it. Except the people who build the Reset are basically building us <em>thier</em> vision of how the future should work, and we don't really get to make a choice in it at any point because "The Virus Made All This Unavoidable".</p>

<p>Yes... But then how would you use that to claim that Jewish globalist George Soros is behind the Democrats forcing a mask mandate on the whole world just to steal the election from Trump so that the dems can better serve their reptilian alien overlords. Huh? Checkmate libtards. 😜</p>

        <p>These stats indicate that a lot of variation from year to year is normal.  This year, a large number of people are wearing masks indoors most of the time, people are washing their hands better, a lot of kids are not in school or are required to wear masks and keep their distance, there are few large public gatherings, and people are staying home much more when they're feeling sick. That last point is probably a major factor.  </p>
<p>Thanks to all the claims about how many people die of flu every year, people are being more considerate about not sharing germs and were encouraged to get the flu vaccine.  People are required to wear masks and are washing their hands more in places that are major sources of illness, like planes and airports, theme parks, and doctors' offices.  There are no cruises.  People who are more likely to get really sick from the flu and get tested are much more protected from exposure to any illness. </p>
<p>So, flu has not been eradicated but is down significantly from normal.  This seems like evidence that COVID is more contagious, and possibly that without all these mitigation efforts, there would be a lot more COVID just as there would be a lot more flu?</p>

        <p>I don't blame one political party or one person (there were plenty of mistakes by everyone) but regardless of what Trump did, obviously there have been efforts by governments, businesses, and individuals to reduce the spread of the virus.  I don't think it's impossible that those efforts have cut off the flu from spreading widely at this point in the flu season, and that they have slowed down but not eliminated COVID.  Experts have been saying all along that COVID is more easily spread than the flu.   This is not surprising.</p>

        <p>Your points are valid. I don’t understand people who downvote but don’t engage (just move on if you don’t want to engage?) </p>
<p>Anyways, I agree with these however the anomaly is far too big to be explained by this. Moreover, covid positive cases are going up almost everywhere. If these measures were so effective for a known highly contagious virus like influenza, how are they not effective for another known highly contagious virus?</p>

        <p>Thank you for engaging and discussing.  I actually live in an area of the U.S. where cases are going down after we imposed temporary targeted closures and people got a wakeup call and changed behaviors after suddenly a lot of people knew someone who got really sick or died.   I can understand thinking that it's difficult to believe flu numbers dropped that much.  I hope scientists study it and give us reasonable advice like letting people stay home or work from home when sick.  I got into a debate with someone who thought it meant we should wear masks forever and that there were no negatives to that.  No.  We do need to go back to normal and especially let kids lead normal lives, as soon as we can, and we can't eliminate all risks in life.</p>
