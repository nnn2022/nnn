    <strong>So ya know how people like to claim the flu mostly went away this year because of mask wearing?</strong>
    <p><p>Well if the main PCR test couldn’t accurately differentiate between influenza and COVID, then that means a lot of people thought they had COVID but may have actually had the flu. And since everyone was so scared of COVID, that’s the first test people got when they got sick. Who’s programming this simulation?</p></p>

        <p>What surprises me is how they had the confidence that this whole operation would actually work, because every level of it is so absurd. The mad lads actually tried it on.</p>
<p>And then the same surprise that 90% of people love it so much the want extra tyranny on top. It's not even enough for them.</p>

        <p>Back in December my boyfriend got sick, he had like regular cold symptoms but they were bad so my boyfriend called his doctor and my boyfriend even said "I'm pretty sure it's not COVID" and the doctor told him to go to the hospital and get tested. (They didn't even test him there so we wasted 5 hours but that's another story lol)</p>
<p>I was actually convinced the flu just "died" because no one was getting tested for it anymore since it was basically this when you got sick at any point during flu season:</p>
<p>1) get sick
2) dr says get covid test
3) takes 2 days to even get tested and another 2 days to get results
4) negative test and then by then you feel better anyways</p>

        <p>This is my comment to another poster on here, it's perfect for this thread:</p>
<p>HOW do they know the person has COVID and not other flu strains?
Your source still allows shuffling of statistics; again I'm not arguing that I'm asking an epistemological question; where did the common cold/flu strains go and what percentage of people had that but not COVID? HOW do we know this information? </p>
<p>You'd have to be able to reliably and consistently differentiate between the two to know.</p>
<p>That would be real science. You don't need to guess or trust. You'd have two separate strains isolated you can work with and prove.</p>
<p>Otherwise you are indeed brushing a LOT of very medical nuance under a very big rug.
This sub examines that obvious bulge in the center of the room there: If everything is labeled COVID of course the doctor can sat it was a factor; that's what we're arguing against here how are they proving it's COVID if testing for it is so unreliable to begin with?</p>
<p>Didn't some South American politician swab a papaya and send it to the lab and they're like COVID POSITIVE BRO, lmao?</p>
