    <strong>How many of you are spiritual in some way?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been mostly agnostic my whole life. Acknowledged that there might be something more, but it can't be proven and too many idiots are misguided by religious belief that I just can't subscribe to it in general.</p>
<p>But things have gotten real in the last year, and I find myself in prayer and turning to God for the strength to carry on.</p>
<p>It seems like the world is going to shit and almost everyone I care about is just going along with this bullshit. It seems so obvious to me that there is a serious injustice going on in the world, but everyone seems oblivious to it, and are just going along with this "new normal" because of what they see on their screens. Even those who admit things do not add up, don't have the will to resist it and eventually succumb to an attitude of "we had better just comply, it's the only way to get back some of the things we took for granted before".</p>
<p>I used to sit back and laugh at this stupidity but lately it's becoming an increasingl lonely place to be and I'm losing my will to carry on. </p>
<p>I need some reason to carry on but I haven't found it yet, I have been praying for it.</p></p>

        <p>I wanna personally share my favourite verse. 
Proverbs 3:5-6</p>
<p>“Trust in the lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding. Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take”</p>
<p>This just reminds me, especially in tough times like these where you can easily feel alone in the world, to trust in god. Hope this helps</p>

        <p>Jesus said that He is the way, the TRUTH, and the life. If you want to know if He is real, and His promises are real just turn to Him in prayer, repent of your sins and trust God.</p>

        <p>Christian here!</p>
<p>Honestly, whilst I am saddened by how the western church has largely joined the cult of scientism and forsaken faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as healer, I am actually honoured to be a part of the generation that God found worthy to see these end-time signs go into overdrive. I mean there reason that He chose us to be here is because He knew that we were the best people to be alive at this time, out of the tens of billions who have gone before us. </p>
<p>I see this as a sign that God is counting on us to do His will in the very short amount of time that we still have before the Rapture. The more the world gets darker, the more intransigent I become. I can't emphasise how great my spiritual, mental and emotional health are because of my restrictions-busting church. I will never give up!</p>

        <p>Proverbs 25:2 - It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.</p>
<p>Keep carrying on. Everything that is happening has been told to us beforehand, but it is not the end yet. Stay strong even if it gets worse than now, we are in this together. The invisible war the world leaders are referencing is very real.</p>
<p>If you'd like a look inside of how and why the angels of rebellion act to deceive all of mankind by taking advantage of their innocence and naivety through corruption, I recommend the books of Adam and Eve. And also the entirety of scripture. But those books in particular.</p>

        <p>I do believe in Jesus, and I do truly believe that what we are currently seeing is the buildup or setting up of the world government which the antichrist will take over. Unless if the Great Reset is halted, and we "return back to normal", I don't see how we will ever go back to the way life was before. </p>
<p>If anything, we are definitely seeing how it's possible how quickly the things spoken of in Daniel and Revelation can come to pass very quickly in our modern world. Eventually Revelation 13 will come to pass and we are just witnessing a small foreshadow or preview of what's to come.</p>

        <p>I am a pagan-ish witch with some Christian background (Still believe in God/Jesus), so there's that. My craft mostly involves plants, manifesting, and a little divination work. I assure you - YES there is a God. Whatever you want to call him (God, Allah, Spirit, Whatever), and we all have intuition that connects with that force and we can ALL hear it if we just teach ourselves to listen.</p>
<p>What's funny is most people with my same "bent" are very very liberal, where I am pretty middle of the road. It's pretty annoying sometimes. I am seeing some changes as other people are hearing similar warning messages as I've been hearing for a few years - to the point of me being told by a very liberal person I know who has predicted some major life events for me (down to exact dates) that we all need to move to a red state and be at least 15-20 miles out from any city or town, as well as get our health and physical fitness to tiptop shape. It's fascinating to watch this but terrifying at the same time.</p>
<p>But yeah - most people are just ignoring it. It's really just human nature. As much as we espouse freedom and liberty, the fact is that most of humanity just doesn't care, not really. It's a shame because I think that liberty to be who you are and pursue life on your own terms is a crucial part of being human to begin with. But most people just want to be one with the crowd, or get that proverbial pat on the head for being a good boy, etc. It's sad. I've come to a LOT of realizations about that stuff in the last year. The old Matrix red pill/blue pill thing.</p>

        <p>We are, all of us, spiritual. We are born with the sense of the larger, the higher. That which is beyond the physical. An elevated plane of existence tugs at us, occupies our thoughts. Beckons us. Urges us to be better. </p>
<p>One cannot deny this sense, this innate and mysterious knowledge within oneself. Fight it, attempt to reduce it to clichè. Or, embrace spirit and submit to its requisite rigors. </p>
<p>You are not alone, ever, in the struggle. Take heart.</p>
