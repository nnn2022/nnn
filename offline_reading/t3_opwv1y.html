    <strong>The propaganda is ripe</strong>
    <p><p>You know what i noticed ever since bojo has forced the jab on every one or bye bye freedom by end of September. </p>
<p>I've noticed crisis actor Henry dyne was put in place on NHS ad on twitter. Saying he got covid etc but it was all a bloody act. Yes you can hire crisis actors like that lass at that Sarah evard thing. </p>
<p>I used to be an extra in TV and films and I worked closely with actors and crisis actors. </p>
<p>Than this supposed doctors saying patients who died were begging for the vaccine. </p>
<p>Is this Britain or North Korea </p>
<p>The propaganda is very very ripe in Britain of late</p></p>

        <p>You know what crisis actors to they do crisis related things . </p>
<p>I know people whom had the clotshot and suffered side effects and got covid. </p>
<p>But spreading propaganda and paying crisis actors who really don't have it . That's a bit dumb aye. </p>
<p>And these doctors have been paid to set up these and say shit like this. Its how media and propaganda work together ie the scaremongering </p>
<p>Its bit odd aye after Boris said vaccine passports or not freedom unless you have the clot shot that all this is airing now and spreading like wildfire</p>

        <p>Ever since this started , whatever It is ( virus) wise . It has never been about peoples health its always been about control. </p>
<p>If it weren't about control than why covid passports why force people to get the jab . When its our bodies our choice  </p>
<p>Why was a jab made so quick when they take 10 years to make ( my auntie was a pharmaceutical for 40 years) </p>
<p>I'm sorry but I don't buy it at all and I'm not convinced and I am awake to this</p>

        <p>The covid vaccine was made in such short time cos the base of the vaccine was already made to combat MERS, another form of coronavirus. All they had to do was tweak the vaccine towards the current virus.</p>
<p>It's your right to decide what goes in your body. Besides before covid there was a thing called immunisation records which you needed to visit certain countries.</p>

        <p>Much more people are dying from covid.</p>
<p>How is it forced control when the virus will be a distant memory in 5 years time? You can shout and scream as much as you want about tyranny but eventually the virus will be controlled and everyone will move on with their lives... except for you, who will still be knee deep in conspiracies long after the pandemic has ended.</p>

        <p>I'm curious what you think of mRNA creator Dr Robert Malone being deplatformed and his comments on ivermectin and his own views on the vaccines. He's come out after having the vaccine for himself and family saying it need more research and we don't know it's safe. </p>
<p>I know he's been discredited a lot but you have to listen to the person and see what he gave up to go against the narrative.</p>
<p>If you have an interest in your own health and your community, or want to understand why people are hesitant I would recommend listening to his session on the dark horse podcast. I encourage you to listen and challenge what he says, that is a healthy response. </p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing if you have the time to listen and what your thoughts are.</p>
