    <strong>The audacit here makes me puke</strong>
    <p><p>This sub should be banned. Now, you obviously will ban me, because truth offends you. This is fittingly ironic for the band of hypocrites that always complains about "free speech" when someone tells  them shut the fuck up and stop spreading misinformation. </p>
<p>This sub is a cesspool of such selfishness and self-victimisation I've never seen in my life. </p>
<p>You compare yourselves to Holocaust victims, who died in pain after days of agony. Why?  Because you have to wear a fucking piece of cloth on your face. Do you not realise how disrespectful this is to people who actually faced discrimination and torture? </p>
<p>You see yourselves as vigilante heroes of justices because you don't wear masks in public, you praise yourselves for actively harming others out of pure selfishness and oversensitivity. </p>
<p>You are utter hypocrites, calling "doomers" "scared, " "paranoid" and "angry, " when the ones who are that are only yourselves. You cry and complain about "free speech" but when somebody tries to burst your bubble of delusions, you are afraid of another's words to the degree you just ban them. </p>
<p>Please, reconsider what you believe in. </p>
<p>TLDR: you guys are disgustingly audacious and overreact to everything.</p></p>
