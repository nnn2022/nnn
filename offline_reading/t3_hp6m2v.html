        <p>Exactly, only herd immunity can end a pandemic...that's just how they work. The only viruses that can be killed off with severe mitigation methods are high mortality, low R0 viruses like ebola. But fortunately, naturally occuring high mortality viruses can never become pandemics. Only epidemics, like we saw in West Africa in 2014. The more deadly a virus is, the harder it is for it to spread, and it will die off before it can reach pandemic levels. </p>
<p>You can't stop or snuff out a highly contagious but mild, low mortality respiratory virus. That's why the flu never goes away and we just live with it every year. Even with vaccines, about 600,000 people still die every year of the flu around the world. The good news is that covid is not going to be another flu...it's going to be a common cold. Only the initial pandemic is as deadly as flu, once it become endemic it will just be another coronavirus cold, which there are several in circulation already. This isn't the type of virus that can be contained. That's why lockdowns were farcical bullshit right from the beginning and it feels like the world had a psychotic break back in March. Never before in history have they ever done something on this scale, it's truly madness.</p>
