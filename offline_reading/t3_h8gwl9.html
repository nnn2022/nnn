    <strong>Venting on this subreddit is great, but what can we really do? I have serious questions we should all think about.</strong>
    <p><p>Summary: I want people to come together in real life and figure out what we REALLY want to do, non violently.  We need to get together in real life and stop posting online (Please read the entire post if you have time though! I'm internet illiterate and would love to talk with like minded people!) </p>
<p>I found this sureddit yesterday and I've been thinking of what to say. You all have great thought processes, I thought I was going crazy being as me and my partner are the only people I've know in real life who think this shit is... well, bullshit. It got me thinking though, isn't this what "they" (whoever you think "they are") want us to do? Sit behind our computers and just vent and bitch? "They" don't want people with working brains, who haven't been brainwashed into a hive mind mentality to be connected, to be together. It's a fucking laugh for them to see us all complaining online, we have no power when we hide behind usernames and talk about how creepy, or evil, or obviously fabricated all of this is. </p>
<p>I'm not suggesting some kind of protest, but WE all need to do something. Society will never be the same again, I don't care how many businesses "re-open", there will be temperature checks, forced masks, etc. I saw that stupid lubriderm commercial earlier today, with everyone wearing masks and talking about the "newnormal", people high fiving from six apart, people blowing kisses as the "new kiss". It's disturbing. I've always been an anti-social person in a way, I guess more of an introvert, but this shit sickens me. I even saw one article that said it's advised to wear a face mask while having sex. I know, I'm ranting, but I'm pissed. </p>
<p>Anyway- What I really want to ask is, what are we going to do? All societies started from something small; usually a group of like minded people. If we really want change, and it's coming whether we like it or not, some of that change is going to have to come from people like us. Ranting on reddit feels nice, but it's not going to change what's causing our frustrations. </p>
<p>Do we group together in different areas of the country? That seems like the only option to me. Can you imagine renting or buying a house in the future? To hell with renting an apartment, I don't even know what kind of background checks will be mandatory in the near future. And if you have kids; fuck them. I'm not some anti-vaxxer (I understand if you are, I understand your side), but the social isolation and forced testing that children will have to go through is almost unimaginable to me. </p>
<p>I just don't know what to do. In my dream world I would love to find a group, or groups of people, all across the US that are sick of this shit and want to build their own society. Is that too crazy to ask? Too crazy to want? I believe, that with enough hard working people, like myself, it could work. Yes, it would be tough and we would all need land that somebody else has, but I believe the right people could and would make the life they truly wanted. I come from a very mixed immigrant family, they worked hard every second of their lives, and I KNOW they are rolling in their graves that their great-great grandchildren are letting all of this happen. I'm sick of orange signs on doors telling me I "have to wear a mask" but I don't. And guess what happens when I don't wear one? Nothing. It might be because of where I live, I don't know if bigger cities are more strict, but I know where I live nobody gives a shit, they just want to save face. </p>
<p>Maybe we can start all of this; a society where everyone pitches in. If someone has land, they offer it. Someone has good insurance, they offer it to us all. I'm great at psychical labor, and I'm pretty good at forging documents(I havent made ID cards yet though), If someone is good at farming or building, you could teach the rest of us. I was sick of society before this, this just gave me a kick in the ass. Society is rigged, you must have known this by now. Imagine being the "founders" of something new? I don't know if it's stupid, but I think the will of people shouldn't be squashed. We're no better than farm or zoo animals if we let that happen. </p>
<p>I will end this post with saying I am a practical social media/online illiterate. If you look at my  past posts on here, I only reach out when I'm trying to ask a question or comment on something that intrigues me. Reddit and Insta are the only sites I occasionally frequent. </p>
<p>That's all. Have a good day.</p></p>

        <p>So far I am absolutely refusing to wear a mask. I also look at the mask wearing as if they are effing psychos. I am open to suggestions beyond that. A good 90% of the people in my area don’t wear them and pay no attention to the arrows in stores.</p>

        <p>In my area masks are required by law. So I wear them. I don't mind wearing them for a little while because I usually don't have the mask on for more than 15 or 20 minutes at a time but I'm not accepting it if they try to make it permanent part of life</p>

        <p>Vote with your wallet and if there's a local movement writing to your local politicians for changes, be part of that... Encourage politicians who are anti lockdown, anti masks and anti new world order non sense, regardless of politics.</p>
<p>Also speak out at grocery stores and line waiting businesses, politely remind them this is all a hoax at this point and no longer about our safety. I awakened a few back to reality with these simple things. 5,000 people can gather and protest for hours but god forbid there's more then 4 people in a liquor store at the same time ?</p>

        <p>I know how disgusting and disturbing all of this shit is. I do think a lot of it depends on where you live, though. If you are seeing a lot of masks and social distancing where you are and are able to go elsewhere, it could help a lot. I have relocated to a rural area in a red state, and it is a lot more normal here than the large city that I moved from. It made me so happy today to drive by a kids' baseball park and to see large groups of families and kids running around outside, crowding together, having fun, and not a single mask in sight.</p>

        <p>I'm fortunate to be living in a fairly large city that's returning to something resembling normal. Majority aren't wearing masks and there's not a whole lot of signaling. But I feel terrible about the people in the other places that  aren't as fortunate. </p>
<p>Not everyone has the ability to just up and relocate. And running away won't solve the problem. People need to stop cowering in fear of the Karens in their community. Not sure what the solution is; maybe a social media campaign? A flash mob going en masse to a store sans masks? Just as long as it doesn't get political. Leave the Trump signs and MAGA hats home if that's your leaning. Don't give the MSM a chance to label us. Make it about the issue at hand. </p>
<p>And to the OP: I've seen that same commercial and it absolutely infuriates me, especially since the people are all made to look so happy. Maybe boycott companies that use these tactics?</p>

        <p>Yes. I would love to relocate but I can’t, so I’m stuck in this miserable situation. There are a lot of people sick of the shutdowns, but the mask mandates, capacity limits, and gathering restrictions are still in effect. One county even canceled a Christmas event out of fear of the “second wave.” I’m still out two months worth of income. Some restaurants are taking your temperature before you can be seated. Local police are citing businesses who opened against the governor’s orders instead of letting it be. I’m so tired of it, but I don’t have the money and resources to just pack up and go to a red state.</p>

        <p>You're definitely not the only one that feels this way. The most sensible recommendation I've heard is to embrace localism. Try to have casual conversations with neighbors/family and slip in a red pill here and there to get them to understand one or two of the glitches in the matrix every so often. This could potentially expand into a wave effect where neighborhoods band together when shit really hits the fan. Any kind of larger movement would likely be Waco'ed or undermined through counter-revolutionary measures, such as a billionaire funded NGO or media smears to defame it into obscurity. I don't view a 2 State solution as a possibility either, as the elites do not want to loosen their grip when it comes to controlling western civilization.</p>
<p>It's pretty gloomy, but all the escalation that's been going on with cancelling history/movies/tv shows, along with people's lives being upheaved due to riots/covid, is making people look for answers elsewhere. Those who suffer directly due to government and corporate corruption/ineptitude, will more often than not, never look back.</p>

        <p>I had to scroll up for your screen name, because I actually thought my husband wrote this. I'm grateful we're childfree (grateful I got sterilized back in the days of yore, when one was allowed into hospitals for elective procedures), as the next generation is in for such a harsh future. My great-grandmother survived the Blitz. She would be aghast at the sheer stupidity of today's CoronApocalypse hellscape. My husband and I are moving to a remote part of Italy as soon as we possibly can.</p>

        <p>Right?!  I don't really like the idea of myself "breeding", but fuck it, even if I did, if we all got this dumb, maybe we should take a few steps back for awhile. Hope you get to move there soon! That sounds wonderful, I would love to move to a remote part of Italy.</p>

        <p>Peaceful protests will never work. They're either orchestrated by people who believe everything they see on the news and think they can "make a difference", or they're planned by the news themselves. I just got done talking with some s//j//w mixed with a terf and she proved that to me with everything she said. The saddest part... she thought she sounded educated on what's going on.</p>

        <p>Yes. I'm honestly sick of everything that is going on. The ghettos are fine, all small businesses where I am are doing ok, but I'm sick of most people accepting this "new normal" when they go to apple bee's and burger king and fuckin walmart.

        <p>That is what I've been wondering. I suppose the first step would be bringing people together from tri-state areas into a central location all across the US. I'm in NM, so I guess bringing people from colorado, texas and arizona to a central meeting location would be one of the first steps. And the same for everywhere else across the US, the east coast might be able to bring more people together based on the size of their states. I suppose the ACTUAL first step would be finding someone who agrees with us, at least for the most part, and find lodging with them. I'm sure there even plenty of subreddits here talking about living off the grid or living off the land, so finding people in those tri state areas would be essential. And even if there are not sub reddits, I'm sure there are other blogs and websites. It would take work, but I feel like you are a person dedicated to this, and so am I, so if there are two of us, then there are more. Do you know of any groups that are forming? Message me if you do.</p>
