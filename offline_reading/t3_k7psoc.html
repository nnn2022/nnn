        <p>They know majority of the NPCs won’t actually watch or listen to the video, their mind is made up by the ones who title the post and what not. They see ‘covid-denier’ and automatically write them and their thoughts/speech off. There really are brainwashed individuals</p>

        <p>I mean, playing devil’s advocate, he didn’t see a single case of covid OR the flu after February 10th of this past year? Not even the flu? Little odd to me personally unless he’s in some specialty practice and doesn’t usually see mild respiratory diseases. </p>
<p>Make no mistake, covid is real, saying it’s not real makes us look like idiots. But it’s a virus with an insanely low death rate for everyone outside of the elderly and extremely vulnerable.</p>

        <p>Yeah it sounds unbelievable, especially since he said neither Corona nor Flu. It might just be an exaggeration who knows. Sadly you have to be 100% accurate if you want to speak up against the lockdowns etc. and even if you just mix something up by mistake while speaking it is always being cherry picked.</p>
<p>\&rt; "Make no mistake, covid is real, saying it’s not real makes us look like idiots. But it’s a virus with an insanely low death rate for everyone outside of the elderly and extremely vulnerable."</p>
<p>My stance as well.</p>
<p>Anyway just wanted to point out something that I see all the time even when someone states very clearly that Corona exists and that they just think the response is wrong. In Germany MSM calls people Covid deniers completely ignoring what they actually said.</p>

        <p>I have never worn my seatbelt, and how many accidents have I been in because of that? NONE!</p>
<p>This seatbelt stuff is insanity, the purpose is to take your freedom and control you, to shut you down. The forces involved in car crashes would not be helped by seatbelts, and you might even be tracked in your car by them!</p>
<p>This is actual arguments from seatbelt debates. </p>
<p>Further, he says that the mask won’t filter out the virus because the virus is smaller than the mask will filter, HOWEVER- do we exhale virus, or water vapor/“respiratory droplets” that carry the virus? Is aerosolized virus smaller or larger than the virus itself? <strong>You do not exhale virus alone, so the mask will in fact stop the water vapor from getting through, and the viral load is trapped inside the water vapor and thus the mask.</strong></p>
<p>Take a peek at the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html">CDC guidelines</a> and decide for yourself, who knows better. </p>
<p>A lot of the posts on this and other subs claim masks don’t work. This is incorrect, and most of the sources posted (realistically this sub is not big on sources or any kind of journalistic integrity or discussion, see how many downvotes I get for this lol) are about cloth/cotton masks that actually don’t help much and <em>don’t meet the CDC guidelines for masks.</em></p>
<p>Over a quarter million Americans have died, millions infected, and as a result our economy is in shambles. The way to get back to normal is to slow the spread of the virus using the same tactics that have worked for other viral outbreaks across the world: social distance, contact tracing, wearing masks when interacting with people outside your immediate circle, getting tested regularly, on and on. </p>
<p>It’s a world full of educated and experienced scientists vs trump and his cronies, I would suggest that people aim their skepticism inward as well as outward, do some research and avoid subs like this (where people don’t post sources, focus on memes, circlejerk and slow down how often people who aren’t on board with the message can comment). Being in an echo chamber makes us dumb. </p>

&rt;This is actual arguments from seatbelt debates.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of seatbelts have been demonstrated scientificly. Also, many people who actually have been in a car accident know from experience how their seatbelt saved their lives. Also, there's the fact that there's zero downsides to using a seatbelt, other than minor annoyance.</p>
<p>Neither the effectiveness of face masks nor the effectiveness of lockdowns have been demonstrated. Face masks may actually do more harm than good. And lockdowns most definitely are detrimental. So your comparison between seatbelts and face masks or lockdowns don't hold... at all!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><em>There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.</em><br>
— Anthony Fauci, Chief Medical Advisor to the US President, 8 March 2020</p>
<p><em>However, we know that [a face mask] does not protect you. On the contrary: it sometimes gives a false sense of security. You will move closer to others, some people wash their hands less and are less attentive.</em><br>
— Marc Van Ranst, Belgian Flu Commissioner, 1 April 2020</p>

        <p>Might want to check what Faulk says about masks again, you can’t really claim that Fauci is both not to be trusted but a source for your comment. He either is or isn’t the foremost prominent expert or he is, if he is then you should remove that comment. </p>
<p>People have died from seatbelts, certain types of accidents it is better not to be wearing them (though this is overwhelmingly overshadowed by their benefit), and also people don’t wear them properly (just like masks) and that causes issues, so it isn’t as cut and dry as you present. </p>
<p>Further, take a peek at the CDC guidelines for masks, which has sources and studies and concludes, along with nearly every other country, that masks are an important part of slowing the spread of disease, when used in conjunction with other steps. </p>
<p>Imagine an outbreak of Ebola and people claiming that masks and social distancing are bad and actually help spread the disease. Do you think those steps would be uncalled for during an Ebola outbreak? Like you’d be in a store arguing that they shouldn’t require masks, or that everyone should travel as normal?</p>

<p>The point is that until April all experts seem to agree that face masks are useless and may even be harmful.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, the "official" experts changed their minds. And now many of us are even forced to wear masks... yet the science actually supporting this practice is still totally lacking.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;People have died from seatbelts, certain types of accidents it is better not to be wearing</p>
<p>Fair enough. That's actually a good point.</p>
<p>We can compare the number of lives saved by seatbelts with the number of lives lost because of seatbelts. If the former is significantly greater, one might argue that this justifies mandatory seatbelts.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that wearing face masks is effective at all. And there is lots of evidence that the lockdowns cause far more harm than they prevent!</p>
<p>Remember that we're talking about a virus where &rt;99.97% of everyone under 40 and &rt;99.5% of everyone between 40 and 65 survives after infection. If you want to protect the elderly and other groups who do have a higher mortality risk, there's far more effective methods than locking down entire countries and forcing everyone to wear face diapers.</p>

        <p>For the point about masks being ineffective (which flies in the face of the CDC and the documented studies in their website, assuming you’re not speaking specifically about cloth/cotton breathable masks) if the virus were Ebola, with a considerably higher mortality rate, and I suggested that no one wear masks or social distance, just act normal after it has killed 250k people, you’d be ok with that?</p>

        <p>We're talking about a virus that barely kills anyone under 65.</p>
<p>We're talking about a survival rate of &rt;99.97% for people under 40 and &rt;99.5% for people between 40 and 65.</p>
<p>The average age of death for people WITH Covid is around 80... which is about the same as the average age of death for people WITHOUT Covid.</p>
<p>If we look at global number of deaths for 2020 in Sweden, one of the countries that took LEAST measures, we see nothing out of the ordinary compared with the decade preceding it.</p>
<p>This suggests that acting normal would have been the proper response, at least for healthy people under 65.</p>

        <p>As a sidenote to my other comment...</p>
<p>Since you mentioned the CDC, here's a recent study on the effectiveness of face marks for influenza :</p>
<p>&rt;In this review, we did not find evidence to support a protective effect of personal protective measures or environmental measures in reducing influenza transmission. Although these measures have mechanistic support based on our knowledge of how influenza is transmitted from person to person, randomized trials of hand hygiene and face masks have not demonstrated protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza, with 1 exception. We identified only 2 RCTs on environmental cleaning and no RCTs on cough etiquette.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Hand hygiene is a widely used intervention and has been shown to effectively reduce the transmission of gastrointestinal infections and respiratory infections. However, in our systematic review, updating the findings of Wong et al., we did not find evidence of a major effect of hand hygiene on laboratory-confirmed influenza virus transmission. Nevertheless, hand hygiene might be included in influenza pandemic plans as part of general hygiene and infection prevention.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility. However, as with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce the transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources are stretched.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It is essential to note that the mechanisms of person-to-person transmission in the community have not been fully determined. Controversy remains over the role of transmission through fine-particle aerosols. Transmission by indirect contact requires transfer of viable virus from respiratory mucosa onto hands and other surfaces, survival on those surfaces, and successful inoculation into the respiratory mucosa of another person. All of these components of the transmission route have not been studied extensively. The impact of environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, on influenza transmission is also uncertain. These uncertainties over basic transmission modes and mechanisms hinder the optimization of control measures.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In this review, we focused on 3 personal protective measures and 1 environmental measure. Other potential environmental measures include humidification in dry environments, increasing ventilation, and use of upper-room UV light, but there is limited evidence to support these measures. Further investigations on the effectiveness of respiratory etiquette and surface cleaning through conducting RCTs would be helpful to provide evidence with higher quality; evaluation of the effectiveness of these measures targeting specific population groups, such as immunocompromised persons, would also be beneficial. Future cost-effectiveness evaluations could provide more support for the potential use of these measures. Further research on transmission modes and alternative interventions to reduce influenza transmission would be valuable in improving pandemic preparedness. Finally, although our review focused on nonpharmaceutical measures to be taken during influenza pandemics, the findings could also apply to severe seasonal influenza epidemics. <strong>Evidence from RCTs of hand hygiene or face masks did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza, and limited evidence was available on other environmental measures.</strong></p>

<p>What is it about Covid-19 that makes face masks effective for it, when they're not effective for influenza?</p>
<p>Isn't Covid-19 supposed to be way more contagious?!</p>

        <p>Not only does that quoted article specifically say that masks still have value “however, as with hand hygiene,  face masks might be able to reduce transmission of other infections and therefore have value in an influenza pandemic...”  but:</p>
<p>Secondly, I believe you are taking that out of context. Correct me if I’m wrong, but it’s a different disease that does not transmit as easily, does not last as long on surfaces, and the RTCs were based on small groups in college dorms and in a pilgrimage, and had no controls for things like using the masks correctly or what specific masks were used. </p>
<p>Further, and more fucking importantly, <strong>you cannot cherry pick a single study about face masks during an influenza pandemic from the CDC, yet ignore other studies and especially the overall conclusion based on multiple studies that masks are an important part of preventative measures.</strong> Come on man, you cannot use the very source you are trying to discredit ffs. I can tell you are better than that. USING THE CDC, TO ARGUE YHAT THE CDC IS WRONG...</p>
<p>Lastly, Ebola breaks out, the CDC recommends social distancing and masks, would you tell your family not to wear them because they are ineffective.</p>

<p>I don't care what the CDC says.</p>
<p>I was one of the first to wear face marks long before almost everyone else... when Fauci and other "experts" were still mocking people for doing so. Back then I thought Covid-19 might we worse than the media &amp; politician were portraying it as and when I still believed face masks would be useful.</p>
<p>The more I learnt about Covid-19 &amp; face masks, though, the more I realize that these masks are unnecessary and that Covid-19 isn't worth making a fuzz about. So I only wear them in public buildings where mandatory, because I don't want to get into conflict with people who DO believe the masks are useful.</p>
<p>I don't know what I would do IF there's an ebola outbreak, because I don't know anything about ebola. It's a different virus with different symptoms that I'm sure spreads differently. But you can bet I would find it out on my own rather than relying on the media, CDC, etc.</p>

<p>Ebola has never been an issue in this part of the world. Hence the reason I knowx little to nothing about it. If there ever is an Ebola-outbreak, I will make sure to do the proper research... and I will make my decisions regardless from what the media or the government tell me I should do!</p>

        <p>Ever think that maybe, just maybe, if we all followed the scientific guidance for a little while then maybe this wouldn’t be so bad and the effects you describe might be lessened?</p>
<p>We are following none of them, and we have the worst covid situation of any major country. We have the highest death rates, the most infected, etc etc. 250k+ people, the equivalent of a 9/11 every day, young people as well. We are putting essential workers at risk. We are doing some exceptionally stupid things at a leadership level. </p>
<p>So what we aren’t doing doesn’t seem to be helping. Perhaps we try listening to the foremost scientists on the field?</p>
<p>Trust me, I’m feeling the effects more than most, and am super frustrated at people’s inability to follow really basic guidelines which seems to directly was to the virus spreading more (certainly you don’t think it will spread less if we all ignore the guidance) and would really like to see things get better. </p>
<p>The president got it. Most of the people around him got it. Rudy has it. He holds superspreader events even now. Ignoring basic scientific guidance (or picking the doctors you prefer, which just so happen to match your personal beliefs and fly in the face of common sense) is not the way forward imo.</p>

<p>What scientific guidance?</p>
<p>Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, Dr. Sunetra Gupta and Dr. Martin Kulldorff wrote a document known as <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/#read">The Great Barrington Declaration</a>, which has more than 40 highly reputable co-signers, where they expressed the following concerns : </p>
<p><em>Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal. Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold. Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed. Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home. Restaurants and other businesses should open. Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume. People who are more at risk may participate if they wish, while society as a whole enjoys the protection conferred upon the vulnerable by those who have built up herd immunity.</em> </p>
<p>I agree with THESE experts.</p>
<p>Why don't you?</p>
<p>Why do you trust the experts parading on television, when they have been proven to be wrong back in 2009? </p>

<p>Buddy, you JUST linked an article like three comments ago that said that hand washing was not effective in the influenza studies, so which is it?</p>
<p>So you have experts you prefer, that just happen to line up with your own ideas?</p>
<p>Before I comb through ANOTHER king ass article, why do you believe them, in spite of the article you posted that contradicts them, but not other experts?</p>
<p>Edit: I just realized you’re advocating her immunity for a disease that will need to kill millions of people. Also, do you see the state of our hospitals? Ffs</p>

<p>Washing your hands before you eat, after you go to the toilet or after you handled something dirty is something people have been doing for decades. And we should most definitely continue doing that.</p>
<p>I don't see them mentioning how often we should wash their hands, so it's not clear to me whether they suggested we should wash our hands more than normal or not.</p>
<p>The first sentence of the quoted part suggests they aren't refering to excessive handwashing :</p>
<p><em>Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal.</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So you have experts you prefer, that just happen to line up with your own ideas?</p>
<p>I go where the data leads. And the data disprove the "experts" running the show.</p>
<p>Again, see <a href="https://johnslegers.medium.com/connecting-the-dots-between-covid-19-and-the-not-so-great-reset-798e8ba7d95">this article that I wrote a few days ago</a> on this and a lot more!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;why do you believe them, in spite of the article you posted that contradicts them, but not other experts?</p>
<p>... because all the data suggests that ONLY certain high risk groups should be protected... namely people over 65 and people with certain conditions that make them extra-sensitive to respiratory conditions.</p>
<p>For everyone else, there's no reason to not let life go on as usual. And any self-respecting honest expect will come to the same conclusion if they take an honest look at the data!</p>

        <p>Well hold on now. According to the article YOU posted, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article?f">from the CDC</a>:
&rt; RCTs did not provide evidence to support a protective effect of hand hygiene against transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</p>
<p>So the same webpage has evidence that masks aren’t effective but when it says that about hand washing it doesn’t count? </p>
<p><strong>OF COURSE</strong> we should wash our hands, and the CDC DOES have guidance for washing your hands, but imagine someone arguing that we shouldn’t be washing hands, that the sick people can choose to wash hands but the rest of us don’t need to. That’s what you sound like...</p>
<p>Further, have you posted about 60 times in the last day or so? What’s the deal w the spam, genuinely curious.</p>
