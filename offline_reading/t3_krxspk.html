    <strong>Is there a name for the archetype of "restaurant server turned twitter activist?"</strong>
    <p><p>Have seen this play out at least ten times on my various social media feeds.</p>
<p>Do we have a name for this yet?</p>
<p>Minimum wage worker - usually a woman in their early 20's working at a bar, restaurant, coffee shop, or the mall - doesn't seem to have a lot going for them. Most of their posts are just selfies, what they're eating for dinner, or what they're watching on Netflix that evening. They don't seem to have fulfilling hobbies or interests.</p>
<p>Once 2020 hit, they immediately bandwagoned mask/Covid propaganda. It's literally all they post about now and since they're young and constantly on social media, they make these posts 4, 5, 6 times per day. Every time they see someone without a mask or not following protocols they run to twitter and make a big deal about it. These rants are supplemented by them constantly sharing articles from local news or national news advocating for masks or lockdowns. They'll sometimes retweet video of anti-maskers with some sort of caption that they think is snarky but sounds juvenile. The video is often not damning at all and the anti-maskers just come across as... normal people.</p>
<p>When not posting about Covid, it's a mix of content from fringe activism accounts regarding the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Black Lives Matter (and subsequent charities to donate to)</li>
<li>LGBTQ+ awareness</li>
<li>"Sex Work is Work!"</li>
<li>Anti-Trump/Pro-Biden</li>
</ul>
<p>I've watched at least 10 women fall into this trap. If I didn't know them personally or follow them on social media long enough to know they're a real person, I would literally think they were bot accounts or paid shills.</p></p>

        <p>NPC's, they are all just Non-Participating Characters, part of the program with no real soul behind them, as loud as they are lost, an obstacle to encounter and suss out before they derail your life mission, full of attention seeking behaviors that hijack your intentions and sense of purpose, bog you down in minutia and their dramas, posing in any role, but tending to be of pedestrian consequence. Here is an AOC type NPC on steroids:</p>

        <p>Women naturally follow mainstream influences.</p>
<p>Men have been turned into cucks, so men are following the women. </p>
<p>That is why we have an army of idiots serving the mainstream, and ‘hip’ idea that wearing a mask is not only clout catching, but is also saving lives. </p>
<p>In 1776, the women would have followed this trend, the men would have revolted, and the women would have woken up and followed that pursuit. </p>
<p>Can’t have a society of cucks following what women think to be true. There’s a reason why natural masculine energy is to ‘lead’.</p>

        <p>Ah yes this was exactly what happened in 1941 Nazi Germany too. Silly women got all influenced by Hitler and the men just followed along... 🙄</p>
<p>You think men are behaving obediently during Covid because of..... women? They are just ‘’following what women think to be true’’?? How much do you have to hate women to have reached this bizarre conclusion exactly...? </p>
<p>Throughout history, almost everyone, apart from a VERY small group of brave men and women, have been very easily influenced and very compliant. Most people love being told what to do and it has nothing to do with gender. Men have been willingly offering up their lives as fodder for pointless causes for centuries.</p>

        <p>Oh you’re funny. You think this was an attempt to be sexist or something? </p>
<p>Simply put, men have ‘masculine’ energy. Masculine energy encompasses being a leader, following and seeing through your mission and purpose. </p>
<p>Women are care givers, but aside from that, they tend to follow whatever is ‘trendy’. I’m not sexist, that’s just a result of our biological composition. </p>
<p>Men have been turned into cucks (feminine men), and they follow women around (truth). Put women on pedestals, and the rest follows.</p>
<p>So now it’ll be women following trends, in addition to their army of ‘save a life’ simps. </p>
<p>This is the cold hard truth of the situation. Our culture has cultivated a population of non-questioning, obedient, and servant men and women.</p>

        <p>Have you actually been to a lockdown protest? It’s a very even split between men and women.</p>
<p>Get off the internet and go outside more. Real life and real people don’t fit your biological theories. Most men and women are non questioning and obedient and have been forever. A small minority of men and women are not like this. </p>
<p>This male ‘leader’ fantasy figure of yours has a load of brainless male goons following him and mindlessly doing his bidding and they aren’t like that because they’ve been ‘feminized’. That’s just how they are. Men are very capable of following other men like complete sheep and it has nothing to do with women. Men aren’t all leaders. That just doesn’t add up.</p>
<p>Why would you even want to blindly select men to lead? Wouldn’t you rather have the top half of IQ to do it or something?? You seem kind of obsessed with dick.</p>

<p>You’re an anti lockdown, anti Covid cult guy and you’re on a relevant subreddit to discuss these issues. You spot a post from a woman saying ‘’Men naturally follow mainstream trends, it’s just biology. That’s why they’re being so obedient right now. In contrast, women are naturally revolutionary leaders but unfortunately they’ve been socialised to just follow men’s sheep like behaviour in recent times.’</p>

        <p>Well I guess I don’t feel <em>’personally offended’</em> because I’m <em>not</em> a woman, whom tend to respond based on their emotions, whereas men respond based on what is rational and logical - this is not my ‘incel’ opinion, this is based on decades of research on men and women. </p>
<p>That being said, my post was never meant to be a personal attack on women, simply. In fact, more of a harping on men in western society for not being better men.  </p>
<p>It goes well beyond that, but there’s some clarity.</p>

        <p>I personally know a few from my workplace. They are boring and annoying to hang out with, they will never be more than an acquaintance to me. I even blocked their Instagram stories as it's only lazy activist bullshit but it's just an image. They actually don't do shit other than repost stuff on social media. Virtue signaling at its purest, trying to give meaning to their lives</p>
