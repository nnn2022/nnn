    <strong>When did big corporations become part of our lives in such an intimate way after March.</strong>
    <p><p>Slightly off topic but still. Prior to COVID I had never heard of Jeff Bezos, used amazon rarely and relied on stores for my things. But it seems after March we all love Amazon, We love Netflix.  “ it makes quarantine so easy” as the doomers would say. These businesses and their owners are so engrained into our lives .  I feel this will only get worse as small businesses close. Rather than knowing your local business owners on friendly terms we now worship Jeff Bezos.  Suddenly that mans face was everywhere, in Instagram memes, Reddit posts. </p>
<p>Maybe I just never noticed it</p></p>

        <p>I genuinely just hadn’t.  Admittedly I never followed the news until this year but it seems like his face and name were plastered in memes and Reddit posts this year.</p>

        <p>I think they are just trying to take advantage of the whole situation and advertise their stores as being "safe" from measures they have in place like 6 ft distance requirement, requiring masks on employees and customers, having one way isles, a person standing at the door counting people going in to make sure it doesn't get too crowded, having a "temperature station" for employees going to work, or other silly things. So they create ads for this to make people believe that they are "safe" shopping in their store. Since Amazon is a big delivery business, I am not surprised that online shopping activity has increased for them. Other stores were also pushing for ordering online or curbside pickup for grocery stores.</p>
