    <p><p>TLDR: US Mainland nuclear bomb tests from the 1950s and 1960s released unprecedent amounts of radioactive elements into the environment including Group I member Cs (caesium), whose radioactive isotope ^(137)Cs easily substituted K (potassium) in K-depleted soils.</p>
<p>Result? Bee colony collapses and bioaccumulation in plants and animals. The ExPeRtZ didn't even bother to point out the obvious: humans, who sit at the top of the food chain, are going to be affected even more.</p>
<p>Fancy that!? ExPeRtZ in the 1950s and 1960s did not foresee that a by-product of their nuclear bomb testing would result in atom-substitution in plants and subsequent bioaccumulation in the entire food chain. 65+ years later, their folly is still evident but we should not forget that ThE hAlF-LiFe Of ^(137)Cs Is 30 yEaRs even though there's no way to know what it does in the human body.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I can't wait to get my experimental FDA/EMA/MHRA emergency-use authorised 'vaccines' because the ExPeRtZ have assured us that the risks are minimal. They'll never cause genetic substitution just as there was never going to be ^(137)Cs substitution of K in US soils thousands of miles away from where the bombs were tested.</p>
<p><strong>BeLiEvE tHe ScIeNz</strong> and enjoy your ^(137)Cs-infused honey!</p>

        <p>Off topic but since your into radiation what do you think about this guy? Are the dangers of some types of radiations overblown?</p>

        <p>Well, considering that U-238 has a half-life of 4.5 B years and U-235 has one of 704 M years, they are not a cause of concern as long as they are not critical (ie, remain sub-critical). I can't remember the half-life of U-234. I wouldn't hesitate to ingest sub-critical U either.</p>
<p>"Radiation" is a vague term to describe alpha, beta and gamma ionising radiation. Alpha is the most dangerous (ie, most ionising) but has the least range, whilst gamma is the least dangerous (ie, least ionising) and has the longest range. Note that I am associating "danger" with ionising energy and *NOT* ionising range.</p>

        <p>Ah ok makes sense. You seem pretty well versed in this. Would you say something like this for whatever they are releasing into the atmosphere?  Nanosized particles of metals like aluminum and manganese etc. We know Zinc cadmium sulfide was air dispersed on Americans in the 50s so what are we doing now ?</p>

        <p>I am neither from the US nor a nuclear physicist. I just have many subscriptions to science magazines and find myself reading them whenever I have free time. </p>
<p>I would hazard the guess that cadmium, a heavy metal, would partially ionise in water and create cations that can react with organic molecules. I know that zinc sulphide is used in fluorescent reactions when you add silver, copper, manganese etc and brings back fond high school memories.</p>
<p>Inhaling either sulphide compound is something that cannot be safe and I am not surprised that the recidivist US government experimented on its citizenry without their consent.</p>

        <p>From all that I understand about it, alpha and beta emitters are relatively harmless when they are not ingested, they only cause major damage after being ingested and integrated somehow into the body. An alpha particle is not much more than an ion of heavy helium, and won't usually penetrate our skin. Beta particles are free electrons or positrons (positively charged electron sized particles) and penetrate a bit more... they actually use beta emitters to qc check many canned drinks for fullness, cause the liquid will stop (absorb) it but the thin aluminum will not. Makes you want a coke, right?</p>
<p>Gamma is a photon and will zing slam through most things, and fractures DNA strands on its way through living things, causing strange mutations outside of the dominant/recessive gene paradigm. This is why containment vessels in reactors and ceilings of fallout shelters are thick concrete and steel, and why they put a lead vest over your vitals and genitals when you go in for an x-ray. We can tolerate a decent amount of gamma exposure, and we do every day from cosmic rays/the sun/ man-made causes in the rise of what is considered "ambient" (after fuck-u-shima they raised this average value from 15 cpm to 25!)</p>
<p>But there is a threshold that gamma starts to kill us pretty quick- it starts killing tissues when the Flux density gets too high, and this is the rad-sick that makes teeth/hair fall out, causes sores. A little higher causes organ failure and cognitive disability, and higher still is unconsciousness/ relatively quick death</p>
