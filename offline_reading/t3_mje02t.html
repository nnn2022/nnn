    <strong>How can people not see the holes in this “vaccine” info?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m trying to understand the logic behind all this. </p>
<p>The vaccine supposedly doesn’t stop a person from getting COVID, but makes the effects of the virus much milder. So if a person gets the vaccine, they can still get COVID and pass it to other people. </p>
<p>People want to get the vaccine so they can “hug their family again.” But if their family isn’t vaccinated, it doesn’t matter if the first person got the shot or not - they can still get sick and be at risk of being hospitalized. </p>
<p>So what I’m gathering is, at the end of the day, the only person “benefiting” from getting vaccinated is the person who gets the shot. Even though they’re trying to make out getting vaccinated as this heroic gesture or whatever, with everyone showing off their stickers, pins and cards. </p>
<p>It’s alarming how many people can’t see through this, how many people are completely brainwashed by this whole fiasco a year later. I’m not getting this vaccine because it makes no fucking sense. It technically isn’t even a vaccine. </p>
<p>Lately I feel like I’m living in the Twilight Zone, where the only sane people are the ones who see through all this BS and ask questions instead of blindly following along.</p></p>

        <p>I had to stop trying to understand and work on accepting other people where they are at. People are doing the best they can at their current level of consciousness.</p>
<p>Trust me though, at times I felt like Cypher from the Matrix. Life feels like it would be so much easier if I could just plug myself back in.</p>
<p>Good luck! :)</p>

        <p>Exactly. That's why psychedelics, like psilocybe shrooms, are banned. They make you question everything, they make you dissolve opinion structures, and they dissolve culturally laid down models of behavior.</p>
<p>I remember I woke up during an ayahuasca trip in Peru. I originally went there to figure out my depression and such, but I saw a lot more than just that. I started to see how material and fake the world is. The world is poor because of the egocentric beliefs that the few impose on others.</p>

        <p>If they say that the vaccines prevent people from spreading the virus, then there's no reason to keep people locked down.</p>
<p>And yet, if the vaccines <em>don't</em> prevent people from spreading the virus, then there's no reason to do vaccine passports.</p>
<p>They are being intentionally wishy-washy about this because they are trying to manipulate you. The purpose of all of this is to wear you down psychologically so that when they lift lockdown restrictions you praise the government for giving you your freedoms back. And once people are primed for this, the narrative will shift hard to say that lockdowns were a mistake and what we really need now is the vaccine passports.</p>

        <p>The usual strategy is in increments. Usually they push, relax a little, push harder, relax a little, push even harder and eventually you'll get ppl conditioned.   Society and it's culture has become more materialistic and ridiculous overtime</p>

<p>But they'll keep going about acting as if they're some sort of hero for getting vaccinated when I'm reality all your doing is protecting yourself. This is what makes forcing everyone to get it make even LESS sense than the obvious</p>

        <p>I think the mentality that makes people get the vaccine doesn't come from reason. I don't even think it comes from fear of covid. I think it comes from FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). It's the newest Playstation model for them. They want to be included.</p>

        <p>There’s a video of Fauci stating that in the ENTIRE history of respiratory illnesses, asymptomatic carriers have never been a driving force. Ever. Period. I still have my doubts about if an “asymptomatic carrier” is really a thing. I don’t know of an illness that wouldn’t manifest symptoms if you were to have it. Correct me if I’m wrong.</p>

        <p>Because 'driving force' means the highest risk, not the only risk. See how many people are going crazy Howard Hughes with "sanitizing" everything? Yeah, touch has never been a 'driving force' &amp; literally the lowest risk of all, but it has become a fetish. </p>
<p>Infected people transmitting through close contact has always been the driving force of respiratory infections, but idiots are pretending that extreme low risk things are worse. </p>
<p>Nothing new about that insanity. Look at the past 20 years, "terrorism" is what scares the average idiot, despite almost non existent risk. "Assault rifles" (semi-auto 'scary guns') are feared &amp; banned despite being almost non existent risk. People fear flying more than driving, despite the actual risk being reversed. </p>
<p>People are stupid!</p>

        <p>Just posted this in another thread:</p>
<p>I think they don't really care who survives as long as they can wipe out the majority, and that's why they want such a large percentage of 'vaccinations'. It's a three part strategy:</p>
<p>1) "Never let a crisis go to waste" - Saul Alinsky, also quoted by Rahm Emanuel. This is the time to act. Increase fear and hysteria; introduce feelgood measures like masks and 'social distancing' as if these can do anything significant. Increase reliance on Government as the Savior.<br>
2) Inject the populace with the Trojan Horse vaccine. It makes them 'feel safer', but in fact they can still get COVID, can still transmit COVID, and still have to wear a mask and isolate. Find out how compliant the terrified public can be.<br>
3) Release the true engineered bioweapon, the one that the vaccine makes people powerless against. All those compliant sheep have no natural defense: their immune systems are shot due to years of masking and distancing; the mRNA has altered them permanently.<br>
Result: between 50% and 80% of the world population gone in the space of six months.</p>

        <p>Let me be more specific, then. Early on they built more field hospitals which went unused or barely used (I saw a video of a man saying he was given the option to go home or go to the field hospital, so he clearly was not in need of hospital care because he was given the option to go home). I believe something like 24 people used that field hospital before they abandoned it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they went from catastrophizing they were going to have to pull nurses out of nursing school early to only weeks later laying off hospital workers. No more talk of pulling students from school early to work in these overrun hospitals.</p>
<p>The field hospitals all disappeared because they were not needed (at the cost of billions to build) and they (the media machine, TPTB, the narrative) claimed we had to stay on lockdown forever whining that we don't want to overwhelm hospitals.</p>
<p>This is just one example of the bullshit that is this stupid narrative. If you buy that pile of manure, enjoy it.</p>

        <p>&rt; The vaccine supposedly doesn’t stop a person from getting COVID, but makes the effects of the virus much milder. So if a person gets the vaccine, they can still get COVID and pass it to other people.</p>
<p>This is how all vaccines have always worked. They don't prevent a pathogen from entering your body. They prime your immune system to defeat the pathogen quickly after it gets in.  Your immune response happens in three stages: a general "something's in, buy time!" response (fever, mostly), a somewhat targetted response as your body figures out what it is dealing with, and a highly targetted response once the body has had time to create antibodies that perfectly match the invader. It takes several days to a few weeks (depending on the threat) to get through the stages, during which the invader can do damage, and spread itself to others. A vaccine lets your body skip to stage 3 very quickly. The invader will still get in, do some damage, and maybe spread a bit, but it will be eliminated much faster than if the body had to figure it out from scratch.</p>
<p>&rt; People want to get the vaccine so they can “hug their family again.” But if their family isn’t vaccinated, it doesn’t matter if the first person got the shot or not - they can still get sick and be at risk of being hospitalized.
&rt; </p>
<p>It does matter, as the person who got the shot will be much less likely to become seriously ill, die, or suffer crippling lifelong side effects. There's a big difference between feeling bad for a few days, and struggling to breathe in the ICU or having your lungs/heart/nervous system permanently damaged. </p>
<p>&rt; So what I’m gathering is, at the end of the day, the only person “benefiting” from getting vaccinated is the person who gets the shot. Even though they’re trying to make out getting vaccinated as this heroic gesture or whatever, with everyone showing off their stickers, pins and cards.</p>
<p>Everyone benefits, as people who have had their immune systems primed to fight off the infection rapidly are going to spread the virus less. Milder cases will lead to a lower average number of new cases from each sick person. There's a small risk of increasing asymptomatic spread if the vaccine primed immune response is really good at preventing symptoms but not as good at preventing spread (SARS CoV 2 is a clever bugger and can begin spreading before it triggers noticable symptoms), but that is why health officials are urging people not to change their behavior until we have everyone vaccinated.
&rt; 
&rt; It’s alarming how many people can’t see through this, how many people are completely brainwashed by this whole fiasco a year later. I’m not getting this vaccine because it makes no fucking sense. It technically isn’t even a vaccine.</p>
<p>It is a vaccine. It works on the same principle as every vaccine in history: Give the immune system something to work on that will allow it to rapidly deploy a targetted response when a deadly pathogen makes it into the body. 
&rt; Lately I feel like I’m living in the Twilight Zone, where the only sane people are the ones who see through all this BS and ask questions instead of blindly following along.</p>
<p>Asking questions is important and valuable. One also has to be ready for the answer to be "Sometimes things suck, and we have to make adjustments." One important question to ask is, "Do I really want to understand the world, or am I looking for a reason to feel superior to others?"</p>

        <p>Yes, that's most likely true. Everyone's immune response is different, so the duration of that protection may vary (just as it would if you'd gained it through vaccination).</p>

        <p>Great question at the end. I know for sure, having come from leftist virtue-signalling culture, that many people who are taking this vaccine are using this as yet another reason to feel morally right or morally superior to those they call "anti vaxxers or "anti-science" or "freedumb loving people" ...</p>
<p>Oh - but I think you meant it the other way around -- people who are questioning vaccine efficacy and safety (specifically in this covid context) may be looking for a reason to feel superior to others. I'm sure there are some that do feel that way, but there are many, many others who are are simply concerned about all the holes in the covid vaccine story, and are looking out for collective well-being. My point is your question goes both ways ..... both pro vaccine and vaccine hesitant..</p>
<p>If the vaccine does do what it's supposed to and minimizes symptoms, then once the vulnerable have had a chance for a shot, we should be finished with all this, because even if asymptomatic spread occurs (likely to be little), the only people who could then be severely affected would be the non-vulnerable population, who have a 99.98 percent chance of survival (see CDC) ... in which case covid becomes a non-issue.... </p>
<p>IF the vaccines do their job in this way (and they do not work the same way that other traditional vaccines do, so I am not sure why you are saying that they do - everyone knows they are new technology and haven't finished full clinical trials yet, so I am not sure how you, random Redditor, can profess to know this with certainty), I could agree they are beneficial to the vulnerable and anyone who wants one, HOWEVER, we do not need everyone in other demographics vaccinated because the chances of severe illness/hospitalization and death will become statistically negligible. </p>
<p>Regardless of vaccine efficacy, freedom of choice to take it must remain intact (you may be willing to give health control over to multi billion dollar corporations who have long histories of malpractice and lawsuits over various drugs and fraud, contribution to the opoid crisis, etc,... but please recognize that not everyone is willing to do that)</p>

        <p>I think the issue is building up herd immunity. If enough people don't get vaccinated, the virus would just transfer back and forth between the unvaccinated, causing faster mutation. That is a scientifically valid theory and has happened with other illnesses in the past (flu being center), but that's still not a reason to violate people's rights. I was against getting vaccinated for a long time, then chose to just do it, and I'm glad I did even though I'm in a very low risk demographic. Everyone should be free to make up their mind on which risk to take. I live in the country, and my hard-core Republican neighbors weren't on the vaccination train until the wife got COVID and became a long-hauler. Sometimes people just have to experience it for themselves to believe or be willing to protect against something like COVID.</p>

        <p>Great, of course your decision, I just hope you will remain actively supportive to people who don't choose to get it. </p>
<p>Herd immunity is a scientifically valid theory, but it is extremely odd that they changed the definition of it this past year to say that it only comes from vaccines and can't be achieved through natural means. lol. when science becomes a circus show run by $$ then you aren't going to convince me that they have my health interests in mind</p>

        <p>What are "the holes in the covid vaccine story"? </p>

<p>There is no such thing as a non vulnerable population for COVID. With the initial strains, younger people tended to have much lower (almost negligable in some populations) <em>mortality</em>. That doesn't mean they got off completely, however. Younger people still get sick, and many have lasting symptoms from lung, heart, and nerve damage. Newer strains seem to be less forgiving to younger patients, in addition to being more contagious. If we only vaccinate the elderly and chronically ill, we will have hundreds of thousands to millions of young and middle aged people who are permantently injured or disabled by the damage unmitigated COVID does to the body. </p>
<p>&rt; IF the vaccines do their job in this way (and they do not work the same way that other traditional vaccines do, so I am not sure why you are saying that they do - everyone knows they are new technology and haven't finished full clinical trials yet, so I am not sure how you, random Redditor, can profess to know this with certainty), I could agree they are beneficial to the vulnerable and anyone who wants one, HOWEVER, we do not need everyone in other demographics vaccinated because the chances of severe illness/hospitalization and death will become statistically negligible.IF the vaccines do their job in this way (and they do not work the same way that other traditional vaccines do, so I am not sure why you are saying that they do - everyone knows they are new technology and haven't finished full clinical trials yet, so I am not sure how you, random Redditor, can profess to know this with certainty), I could agree they are beneficial to the vulnerable and anyone who wants one, HOWEVER, we do not need everyone in other demographics vaccinated because the chances of severe illness/hospitalization and death will become statistically negligible.</p>
<p>At the level I described how vaccines work, the new mRNA vaccines are exactly the same as older vaccines. They prime the immune system to produce a targetted response. Dialing down into the mechanics, the way that they achieve that is far more clever than older methods, which is why the mRNA vaccines were first synthesized within 24 hours of the SARS CoV 2 genome being published. The period between the vaccines being created in Jan 2020 and their approval in November 2020 was spent on clinical trials. Those trials moved along quickly both because there's a pandemic going on, and because the technology has been studied for decades and is known to be safe. Unlike older vaccines, it isn't introducing a dead or incapacitated version of an actual pathogen into the body, so there are fewer chances of complications due to it's application to this specific virus. </p>
<p>In addition, we have excellent data on the pfizer vaccine's efficacy and safety from: https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2101765</p>
<p>Note that the study has over 1 million participants. The original Polio vaccine trials only had ~650,000 in the placebo controlled study. We know it works, and we know it is safe.</p>
<p>We do need everyone vaccinated, for the reasons above, plus the issue of protecting vulnerable populations who can't be effectively vaccinated, by herd immunity. If you want to refuse to be vaccinated, that's your business, but I hope you won't complain when the rest of us bar you from our schools, homes, and businesses. Participation in society is not without costs.</p>

        <p>You can write all the walls of text you want. I. Am. Not. Getting. It. Even if the different vaccines made me shit golden bricks. Because you know what the more they try to pressure (media, social media, government, business and especially people like you) the less likely it'll become that I'm going to take that shit.</p>
<p>And I'm still able to spread it after I take the shot, why oh why do I need to take it then? So I don't get hospitalized? Or severely Ill? I'm 30 years old in good health. I'm gonna take those chances. Maybe in 3-4 years I'm gonna take it but for now you can be the test subject.</p>
<p>Why oh why do you people want to make something mandatory when it has emergency approval, still in phase 3 studies and you are goddamn cheering it on making it mandatory. With a vaccine passport as a cherry on top. Which you people are also cheering on.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, but this is the first time in history that people are being coerced/forced into taking a product from the pharmaceutical industry in order to live freely. Forgive me if I think rationally about it before doing it. The simple fact is there are no long term studies done on these vaccines and they are only approved under emergency use and won't be fully FDA approved for a few years. That is fact. Thus, it is my choice whether I want to be part of the experiment. If you are saying that my choice means I don't get to live fully in this society, then what you are saying is that our society is now fascist.</p>

        <p>“Sometimes things suck, and we have to make adjustments?” That may be appropriate for some things, but shrugging my shoulders and saying “oh well” and getting a vaccine I don’t want or feel comfortable with is not one of those things. There’s way too much wishy washy info for me to agree to this. If other people feel comfortable getting the vaccine, that’s fine. It’s ultimately their body and their choice. </p>
<p>And as for the superiority thing, I’ve listened to both arguments and I’ll tell you it’s NOT coming from the skeptic side. As much as I hate to make this a right vs left, us vs them topic, the more left wing folks have mostly been the virtue signaling, mask selfie taking, beating a dead horse constantly to show what good doobies they are group. It’s insufferable. I just wish someone would give them their gold stickers so they’d shut up.</p>

        <p>The vaccine just puts the mRNA in your cells to make the RNA needed to attract the macrophages and antigens to help you become more able to fight off the coronavirus. It’s hardly a vaccine but it will avoid many deaths and stop people who get it from spreading nearly as much 🤷🏼‍♂️</p>

        <p>And an mRNA inoculation has never been injected into humans before, so let's do it on a large scale, right? Great idea!</p>

        <p>Yes, we understand how it's meant to work. However, mRNA vaccines are still a very new technology, so it's reasonable for people to be skeptical.</p>

        <p>Let’s all get injected with an experimental gene therapy to aid our bodies in fighting off an illness with a 99+% survivability rate. Because it’s so safe and effective people need to be coerced/threatened and/or bribed to go and take it?? Hard pass.</p>
