    <strong>Stop acting like you care about your Grandma.</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know if this point was made.  I know there have been points of it's not about keeping anyone safe but keeping authoritarianism against people they don't like.  But any point of keeping loved ones safe is one of the most asinine things. </p>
<p>Those people that complain about their grandparents being vulnerable and how you are contributing to putting them in danger do not show any appreciation at all for their parents or grandparents.  Nor will this pandemic "realize what truly matters in life" and have them embrace their family.</p>
<p>They won't admit they weren't giving a second thought about them before and they aren't really doing that now. Worst of all they think they are.</p></p>
