        <p>Submission Statement:</p>
<p>This all started with "two weeks to slow the spread" and denial of any speculation that it would be more than that. They called us "conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>But it wasn't two weeks, and almost everything we speculated about is coming into place. No apologies from the name callers, they're in lock step with what's happening, even though they're giving up their own freedoms as they give up ours.</p>
<p>The acceleration we all feel now is alarming. Every day feels more stressful than the last. Each new headline is another provocation. We see unnecessary lockdowns happening in other places. We hear of people losing their jobs over vaccination status.</p>
<p>They push, push, push. And when we see big protests happen like in France, they barely make any progress against this global force.</p>
<p>We see our loved ones having bad reactions to the vaccines, and find ourselves censored online when we try to talk about it.</p>
<p>If you look at the trajectory we are on, it ends in a dark and miserable dystopia.</p>
<p>There's one bit of optimism: Our numbers are growing fast. More and more people are waking up. Watch the membership here - 97.7k today!</p>
<p>We aren't alone, even if they try to make us feel like we are. If we can organize we may have strength in numbers!</p>
