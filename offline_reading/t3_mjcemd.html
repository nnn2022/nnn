        <p>Looks like you were banned for suggesting the plastic masks with large gaps between the mask and face are equivalent to surgical masks in effect. </p>
<p>Your reasoning being surgical masks aren't air tight therefore plastic masks not being air tight puts them on the same level of surgical masks.</p>
<p>Am I getting this right?</p>
<p>If so, it's fairly obvious using even the tiniest bit of common sense that the plastic mingle mask style masks aren't as effective as a surgical mask. Air flow through relatively large gaps allows for relatively large expulsion of droplets. This isn't rocket science.</p>

        <p>So.. in other words, you have zero empirical data so you have to resort to personal attacks lmao. </p>
<p>There is no standardized form of "face covering" so obviously there is going to be a varying degrees of expulsion. </p>
<p>The question is how this translates to Covid transmissions, specifically how they compare with one another. </p>
<p>Considering there is already extremely negligible merit for mask use as a whole, I was suggesting that the risk reduction for Covid transmissions could potentially be exactly the same as the plastic face-masks because there is zero data to suggest otherwise. </p>
<p>You can test this right now in your mom's basement by trying to find a peer reviewed study to refute it. </p>
<p>It saddens me how delusional you are. </p>
<p>It's like how wrestling is still allowed in schools, but shaking hands afterwards is banned to prevent Covid. </p>
<p>Then having some fanatic (like yourself) vehemently support it like "YOUR LOGIC IS COMICALLY DUMB, OBVIOUSLY MORE EXPOSURE MEANS MORE COVID, HANDSHAKES BAD" </p>

        <p>Thank you for introducing me to this subreddit. Lots of gold on here.</p>
<p>If you have the delusion that a plastic mask which is largely separated from your face (allowing for significant movement of expelled material around open gaps in the fitting) is as effective at mitigating the expulsion of respiratory droplets as a mask which is largely in contact with the face (allowing for reduced movement of expelled material around open gaps in the fitting), you severely lack common sense and basic reasoning skills.</p>
<p>But keep up the good work in saying, "give me a peer reviewed study to disprove my opinion or I'll continue to accept it as fact even if it spits in the face of common sense".</p>

        <p>No problem dude. Sorry you find valid statistical data is such a diluted and irrational concept. </p>
<p>We all know common sense has proven to prevail when it comes to Covid measures, so there's really no need for science anyway. </p>
<p>Kinda like how you only need to wear a mask while standing at a restaurant because covid doesn't spread while sitting. Or gathering in big crowds out front of Costco, because the capacity limits for indoor shoppers (despite limbing over eachother in the aisles) will protect us. Or like our premier who locked down Ontario because we had 1000 cases per day, but deemed it safe to open for a couple weeks at ~3000 cases per day. Or the seran wrap over debit machines and door handles somehow makes them more sanitary. The McDonald's drive through staff that handle your stuff and put it into a bucket, because God forbid you touch opposite sides of a bag at the same time (the bucket is a forcefield, obviously). </p>
<p>It all obviously protecting us, so what's the point of considering the scientific merit? I'd be delusional to even consider that these measures might potentially be security theatre. </p>
<p>Who am I to ask for evidence that proves one measure if more effective than another? Science scares me, so it's best we all just rely on anecdotes from people like you. </p>
<p>Thanks man.</p>

<p>All that stuff you list here is obviously a bunch of crap. I can definitely agree with you there. But if we're explicitly talking about a face covering with a large gap between the face (eg Mingle Masks where the nose is tacitly fully exposed from above) and the covering and one with a smaller gap (eg a surgical mask that is a tighter fit even though unquestionably not a perfect seal), it's simply plain common sense that the face covering with the larger gap is less effective due to its very nature of having a larger gap. Airflow is simply being forced outward from the large gaps presented due to complete lack of a seal.</p>
<p>There are studies regarding flow around face shields. <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0022968">One example here</a>. But those studies do not exist for mingle masks because those masks are not used in a medical setting. The principles would still apply of course. But you're not going to see a 1:1 comparison of surgical mask vs mingle mask in a peer review study. The mingle masks are a consumer product due to having reduced shielding vs a face shield while also having a similar downside to a face shield and reduced seal vs a surgical mask/cloth mask which does not leave the nose essentially fully exposed.</p>
<p>I'll admit I was a dick in the posts above.</p>
