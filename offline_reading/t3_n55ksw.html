        <p>Recent quotes from former Pfizer Vice President and Chief Science Officer <a href="https://wikispooks.com/wiki/Michael_Yeadon">Dr. Michael Yeadon</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;“It’s become absolutely clear to me, even when I talk to intelligent people, friends, acquaintances … and they can tell I’m telling them something important, but they get to the point [where I say] ‘your government is lying to you in a way that could lead to your death and that of your children,’ and they can’t begin to engage with it. And I think maybe 10% of them understand what I said, and 90% of those blank their understanding of it because it is too difficult. And my concern is, we are going to lose this, because people will not deal with the possibility that anyone is so evil…”</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&rt;“If you wanted to depopulate a significant portion of the world, and to do it in a way that wouldn’t require destruction of the environment with nuclear weapons, or poisoning everyone with anthrax or something, and you wanted plausible deniability, whilst you had a multi-year infectious disease crisis; I don’t think you could come up with a better plan than what seems to be in front of me. I can’t say that’s what they’re going to do, but I cannot think of a benign explanation for why they are doing it.”</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&rt;“It's completely absurd to vaccinate the whole world. Our politicians here in the UK and their advisors just lie to us and lead us down the wrong path. It is a crime. It starts with the untrustworthy PCR test. It scares people. In this way, restrictive measures can be implemented. I can only see non-medical reasons for the global vaccinations.”</p>
