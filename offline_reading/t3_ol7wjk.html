    <strong>why is my friend being so stupid?</strong>
    <p><p>hi. i never wanted to post here as i'm just a lurker, but i have no one else to turn to now.</p>
<p>i am making the personal choice NOT to get the jab as of right now. (let me be clear, i am NOT anti-vaxx.) like a lot of people with working braincells, i'd like to wait for longterm data before i inject the devil's piss into my body.</p>
<p>anyway, my best friend of 10+ years has been on the same page as me about the jab, except she's always been a more passive person than i am. so i guess i could say i saw this coming. her college sent out an announcement saying once 1 dose is FDA approved, they'll be requiring all their students to be vaxxed. she was so upset about this, has done her research and has heard about the nasty side effects that could come with it. we discussed a lot. i was happy to have a friend that i could talk to about this stuff. 
after all of this, today she basically told me sooner or later she'll be getting it because she wants to go to a state college campus. i've been telling her for YEARS to try online school. </p>
<p>so out of pure stubbornness, she'd rather risk her life to get a degree she's probably not even going to use or even like, just so she can physically go to school. </p>
<p>i have anxiety just thinking about if she ever developed permanent health issues or even lost her life due to this stupid decision. (by the way, she already had covid in january and was totally fine) 
this is my best friend since grade school. </p>
<p>why are people so fucking braindead now? i just cant wrap my brain around it.</p></p>

        <p>Well maybe she feels that the months it has been out plus whatever time she has with the college is longterm for her and she will feel comfortable then.</p>

        <p>I don't think the government should tell your friend what to do. I don't think you should either.</p>
<p>First and foremost, do you want to be responsible for your friends health moving forward? God forbid she does die of covid 19, you wanna live your life with the doubt that maybe the vaxx would have worked. </p>
<p>Why would you put that stress on yourself. Let your friend make thier own decisions.</p>
