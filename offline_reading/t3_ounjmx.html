        <p>I find it interesting that the laws on guns actually have been going back in the direction of the original intent of the American constitution, which was to have a militarized society that should not necessarily even need a massive standing army unless under imminent threat. Sadly not many people around the world even understand that connection, but the concern over standing armies goes back a long time. It is Biblical really, as many of the founders felt that standing armies were the ultimate temptation for those who fall for the temptation to "make the world in their image" (Cain vs. Abel). </p>
<p>I think from a big picture perspective, underneath the surface is the actual destabilization of the kind of anti-liberal worldview that many institutions are built on already. This whole "new normal" thing may actually just be a last act of desperation from 20th century ideologues. You can see that there is a massive bond bubble going on behind all this, and that means many of the promises made by politicians decades ago are effectively worthless.</p>
