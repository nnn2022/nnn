    <strong>Appeal to emotion</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone else noticed that appeal to emotion is the only real argument your average new normal fan has? Yes, there are the types who will mention or show statistics (though the veracity of these are sometimes questionable), but by and large, the only words they have for us are either insults or "Your actions are going to get someone's Grandpa killed." Or "Don't you think about the children who have been/will be affected?" It's worth mentioning that the primary users of these arguments almost never belong to either group (minors or elders), and many of these same people have no children and haven't called their grandparents in months. It should be obvious that their motives are clearly not to save lives, but rather prove a point. They will spend their time arguing with us online, reading articles about Covid, watching the news, etc, yet they think themselves the enlightened ones, impervious to propaganda. </p>
<p>It seems to me that Elderly people make up the largest demographic of Covid deniers. Many more would rather risk Covid than spend their final years isolated. I'm 17 and I'm missing out on my last years of highschool because of this after not being able to enjoy the first 2 either (due to social rejection and ostracization brought on by some of the same people who now "want to save lives".) My little sister is only 6 years old and she's fucking depressed due to isolation and sometimes cries because she "has no friends". I know of dozens of small businesses that are either struggling or already completely shut down. I'm not even saying that Covid does not exist. It's clearly evident to me, however, that the effects of isolation (both short and long term) are probably going to be worse than any damage inflicted by the virus itself. Imagine if we lived in a society that valued everyone's best interests above extending elderly people's lifespans indefinitely...</p></p>

        <p>It's why pointing out the deaths caused by lockdowns - especially those in the developing world - is so effective. It forces some nuance into their otherwise selfish, panicked flailing.</p>

        <p>Really? Citing millions of additional third world people starving from lockdowns has yielded NO humane response from any doomer I know. I just get the eyes of a cold dead fish. I can never get emotional pleas to work. These people don't give a SHIT about poor people or children or depressed people. Children in India entering the sex trade at younger ages to make money for their family suffering from lockdown? No humanity. Nothing.</p>

        <p>That's depressing to hear. I've managed to get through to a few. But if they are so selfish they just don't care at all, they can be written off strategically: they won't march out to anyone's barricades on a cold morning.</p>

        <p>This is exactly why anything in regards to the medical field should never be politicized. </p>
<p>They made people so damn afraid of the Flu that they are actually okay with wearing a mask, staying home for the holidays, and having complete disregard for the way we all used to live prior. </p>
<p>In its most basic defense - even if this ‘novel covid virus’ has actually claimed over 200k deaths here in the states, there’s absolutely no comparison for the upcoming statistics in depression, suicides, alcoholism / drugs, domestic violence surges, homelessness, or the psychological impact this year will have on young children.</p>

        <p>Medical malpractice is the third leading cause of death in the US but im supposed to be shutting my brain off and trusting the WHO and CDC?</p>
<p>Pointing this out to enough people who "just care about saving lives" usually gets the gears turning.</p>

        <p>that's because the numbers are out and they know it.</p>
<p>Even worst case scenario if everyone in the United States catches Covid-19, here's how many we can expect to die:</p>
<p>Ages 20-49: 27,000</p>
<p>Ages 50 and up: 57,000</p>
<p>Seems to me, we're already at maximum worst case.  So there's no more sense in running numbers.  We're done.  It's over.  </p>
<p>Oh, but all those elderly!  Well, 3 years ago, 56,000 people age 50 and up died of influenza and no one noticed or cared so it's just one more year of that.</p>
<p>Personally, this happens every year and only now we're supposed to be all shocked and shaken?  Ask ANY doomer to show compassion for influenza patients or to be afraid of influenza and you'll get laughed at.   None of them care about anyone unless it's covid.</p>
