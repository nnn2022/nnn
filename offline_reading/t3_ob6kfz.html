    <strong>Masks are the problem. Masks are evil.</strong>
    <p><p>All students in my country (Korea) are required to wear masks.  No evidence they work, no evidence kids are dangerous, no evidence kids are at risk.  Yet they're wearing them all day, and it seems no one except myself cares.  I see no discussion of ending this policy.  Honestly, parents here don't seem to care, neither do the teachers.</p>
<p>How to push this.  Honestly, I think of taking my son out of the school.  My son loves going to school, but it's been a year, yet nothing is changing.</p></p>

        <p>(From Canada)<br>
This all began with the Mask, and will end with the Mask. </p>
<p>We will not get out of this until people give up The Mask.</p>
<p>The Mask is the only visible sign that covid19 even exists, because 99.9% of the people see nothing else from covid19.</p>
<p>The Mask continues to drive discrimination, the trampling of human rights, liberties, body governance and dignities of perfectly healthy people, and allowing businesses to continue to hold food, medicine and essential services ransom from the same.</p>
<p>The Mask is a SUM DETRIMENT to the health of perfectly healthy people.</p>
<p>The Mask blocks droplets, it does NOT block 'highly contagious airborne killer virus variants'.</p>
<p>The Mask is a symbol of submission to the narrative and the longer people wear them the longer all our countries will descend into ruin.</p>

        <p>I feel like that.  Covid isn't the problem, the masks are the problem.</p>
<p>Or to alter Reagan's government statement a bit:</p>
<p>Masks are not the solution to our problem, masks are the problem.</p>

        <p>I agree.  If they still require them in the fall going to lose it.  </p>
<p>For children masks are </p>
<p>&rt;mind control devices </p>
<p>Nothing more, nothing less.  Just another form of brainwashing and indoctrination.</p>

        <p>I’m in CA and very unhappy over the fact that as of now, my kids will have to wear masks to school in the fall! I am hoping my kids school district (which is all of 2 schools) doesn’t enforce this shit. I am not in a position to home school this coming year and even if I was, it is not the right environment for my youngest child and my sanity (and his) probably can’t survive a year of homeschool after over a year of “distance learning”.</p>

        <p>Same over here where I live. Only one teacher I know seemed very frustrated and complained about the fact that he didn't know how his new students looked like... this is sick</p>

        <p>Sorry but you are such a liar... are you even Korean??? Wearing masks has been normal and expected in Korea for years and years.   It is a show of respect for those around you that you cover your face while you are sick.    And obviously all the other parents aren't going to start since stupid revolution... they would be revolting against something that is super normal in Korea.    </p>
<p>Next time you decide to lie about a country how about you bother to learn at least a teenie tiny little bit about the country, the people and the culture.  I mean I am 1/4 ethnically Korean and I still would never try to go to Korea and try to change them to suit me just because I was raised in America.   Seriously you are a pretty trash person for pretending to be something just because it's super easy to get pics of Korean kids in masks... it's only easy because their masks has not that much to do with covid.   They wore masks long before covid.    Grow up.</p>
