    <strong>They murdered my grandma</strong>
    <p><p>My grandmother has been in and out of the hospital for over a year now due to heart issues and bowel blockage.  May 19th she was in the hospital needing surgery for her bowel blockage, but other than that was healthy “For an 86yr old”</p>
<p>During her time in the hospital, my grandfather, mother and aunt were not allowed to see her due to stupid Covid restrictions. <br>
Early morning on May 20th they go to the hospital and are told she passed away at 3am that morning. They are shocked and can’t believe it, the hospital never even called to alert them.</p>
<p>My family wanted to see the body, the doctor and hospital staff refused claiming it’s not allowed due to restrictions.  My grandfather was devastated and actually pushed the doctor and ran trying to see her. Staff grabbed him and police came and took him away.  My mother and aunt argued for hours to staff and they refused to allow it.  </p>
<p>Later the doctor claimed at night my grandma was coughing and wheezing. They gave her covid test and claim she tested positive. Immediately after they put her on a ventilator.</p>
<p>These fucks tested my grandma without our families permission, then threw  her on a ventilator she didn’t even need. My grandma always coughed and wheezed, she smoked all her life and it was normal. The doctor even knew this as he has taken care of her numerous times.   </p>
<p>She died being connected to a ventilator drowning to death all alone with no family by her. They killed her and now also wanting to write her death off as Covid related.</p>
<p>On top of that, I already know these damn doctors are fat paid to claim someone has Covid and paid even more to throw them on ventilators. Unfortunately I live in Japan and not in the states or this doctor and medical staff would taste my full wrath and I would show no mercy...</p>
<p>My family is looking at legal action but I fear nothing will be done about this. My grandma can’t even have a proper funeral due to these stupid ass Covid restrictions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is one way they raise the numbers up, they kill the elderly and claim it was Covid. Doctors are paid $33,000 to throw people on ventilators and are happy to do so. They could careless about killing, as long as their pockets get full. <br>
While healthcare workers claim hospitals are full and they are overworked yet have time to rehearse and create social media dance videos, doctors are misdiagnosing people to get rich.</p></p>

        <p>I’m in the USA. Girlfriends uncle who was an avid Q supporter/Trumper/loud and proud American was getting better from COVID and then suddenly his health just tanked randomly, docs kept family out of the loop and he ended up passing away randomly from “complication”. </p>
<p>You aren’t the only one putting these pieces altogether. It seems like a Genocide to me. </p>
<p>Good luck to you and your family. Sending happy vibes.</p>

        <p>My uncle died because no one was allowed to visit him in the hospital and then they wouldnt let us have a funeral. He worked and provided for his family his entire life, was a WW2 vet, and came from nothing. Then he dies alone and we cannot even have a funeral to celebrate his life and say goodbye.</p>

        <p>Just following orders is not an excuse, these doctors are literally killing people because they have been told to, for profit. That makes them no better than a nazi concentration camp guard and they should be treated the same - put on trial, then executed, since in the US you still have the death penalty. Anywhere else, put them away for life.  That is what happened at Nuremberg.  The Nazis had their own program which lined up exactly with what is going on in our care homes and hospitals right now, it was called Aktion T4.</p>

        <p>They threaten the doctors to take away their licenses. It’s not so easy to say no. That’s why people go along with all of this garbage. You need to focus at the people giving the orders. The individuals aren’t going to stop this.</p>

        <p>Which is why I'm not a doctor. I've always had a passion for biology and medicine, been studying since kindergarten or so, and I've been asked innumerable times by friends and family why I don't go to medical school and get licensed. The simplest answer is pretty much exactly what you said: individuals aren't going to stop corruption. And the medical system - not just in the US, in case any Americaphobes in the audience think other nations are really so different - has been corrupt since long before COVID. I honestly don't think anything can stop the corruption and instability we see in almost every aspect of society today; the rot must run its course in order for a new system to spring up from what remains of the old; as per the social cycle. In the meantime, I refuse to have anything to do with the current medical system as either doctor or patient. I suppose others have their reasons though.</p>

        <p>&rt;My family wanted to see the body, the doctor and hospital staff refused claiming it’s not allowed due to restrictions. </p>
<p>What exactly were they scared of?  That your grandma's dead corpse was going to give your grandfather a virus that is spread predominantly through breathing?  Or that your dead grandma was going to catch a virus from your grandfather and die a second time?  This literally makes no sense and sheds quite a bit of light on just how much of a scam all these "restrictions" are.</p>

        <p>That's kinda fucked up. Don't get me wrong, I think 300,000 babies born everyday around the world is a bit excessive. But I firmly believe that once a baby is brought into this world, presumably against their will unless we find clear evidence that babies choose to be born, we owe our youth a happy healthy life with opportunity for a future worth living. Even if it means risking the lives of elderly individuals who've already lived most of their life.</p>

        <p>My grandmother is dying in hospice care and my aunt had just gone back home to California and then she had to go back to Arizona to be there for when she passes. The hospice only allows her one visitor a day I think. It's very cruel.</p>

        <p>&rt; the doctor and hospital staff refused claiming it’s not allowed due to restrictions. </p>
<p>Yes and that's why I stay the hell away from hospitals. I have first hand similar experiences where you can't take your relatives out of the hospital even when doctors have nothing to offer. And they do make up all kinds of stories and produce fake documents about patient's condition, so it's impossible for you to do anything without taking formally legal action which of course will take years to be processed.</p>

You don't live in Japan of else you'd no that Japan haven't been reporting the sake kind of crowded hospitals as the US.

        <p>Stop lying. There is no extra payment for putting people on ventilators in the real world. Hospitals get paid the exact same for using a ventilator today compared to 10 years ago, adjusted for inflation of course.</p>
<p>I think the bigger issue with them forcing people onto ventilators is that they are scared poopless that these people might be 'breathing out lots of CoVid-19 particles' when they get CoVid-19.</p>
<p>Personally my mother was put on a ventilator and if I could go back in time, I would ask them "Why aren't you asking my mother for permission to do this?" because she could talk when she left the house.</p>
<p>I truly believe the ventilator killed her because I have been reading more and more medical studies that say "Ventilating a CoVid-19 patient is a bad idea because when we do autopsies, the bulk of them who die have micro-bleeding in the lungs!"</p>
<p>Ventilating makes micro-bleeding in the lungs worse.</p>

        <p>I’m going to meet in the middle here. I’m not in the “hoax” camp, although I disagree with the control measures. </p>
<p>But people being stuck in the hospital and their family not being allowed to see them is unethical. I’ve seen posts about this on r/nursing where instead of blaming the hospital administrators, y’all are blaming the people for not complying with your health measures. I don’t care if the people are burning their masks in a fire pit in the hospital parking lot, not letting family members see their loved ones before death is abhorrent.</p>

        <p>Medically inducing comas and ventilators are a death sentence. Once someone is put into or onto either it's writing their death letter. Not allowing family members in and get that sweet sweet Covid death money the hospitals desperately need is why so many people don't believe the lies. The Covid is real but rewarding hospitals for spreading it is why America is where it is today.</p>

        <p>It is absolutely tragic when people die alone and i fully agree with you. I was a palliative nurse during HIV aids. Lonely deaths are the worst. Luckily, nurse (and drs) do what we can. Remember this is a fight - a war if you will. Thats why countries like vietnam are doing so well, a humilty to accept personal sacrifice for the good of the whole. </p>
<p>None of us will be untouched by the long term effects of this - but basic science has nothing to do with government ordinance - your own research into covid should show stay away from people, wash hands, clean surfaces, ride it out. Fuck governments.</p>

        <p>Warning this is long.</p>
<p>I agree with most of what you said. I think you’d agree with this sub more than you or some of the users here even would like to admit.</p>
<p>That said, conspiracy theories can be a way for people to rationalize unacceptable changes in society. As a pilot, I’ll use the “jet fuel can’t melt steel beams” one. People disliked the world changes in the name of fighting terrorists, and they saw governments gain power, and these conspiracy theories rose because of the power grab by world governments. It was convenient, so they connected some dots. They disliked what they saw but could not speak out for fear of being called unpatriotic or un American.</p>
<p>In the same way, this user has had his grandmother die, and he and the rest of his family were unable to see her in her last days. if you don’t believe him, there’s plenty of other people who have had the same thing happen. That’s insane. To rationalize that, some people turn to other theories. Do I blame OP one bit for that? No. I wouldn’t be able to make a rational argument either. </p>
<p>As far as public health measures, I agree, but the absolute wrong way to go about that at a least in the US and most of the west IMO is though compliance, huge fines, taking away people’s freedom of travel, crippling businesses, and saying “the world will not return to normal after a vaccine, until
2022, etc. That’s the real reason for this sub, not to claim the virus is fake and say healthcare workers suck. </p>
<p>There’s also the public health agencies and governments dropping the ball. Discouraging masks for 2 months, then recommending it, now making it law. Having a mixed/contradictory message doesn’t make the public trust you. Just look at airport security and all the jokes about that. </p>
<p>I will include a 2018 excerpt from a scientific journal:</p>
<p>&rt; These data suggest that non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, handwashing/hand sanitizers, and facemasks in any future influenza pandemic may buy valuable time before vaccines become widely available. However, the success of these interventions will depend upon their early and continuous implementation and also people's willingness to comply. The 1918 pandemic has shown that measures are most effective when they are voluntary, as people have low tolerance for mandatory health measures (Spinney, 2017). Indeed, a behavioral study showed that individuals were more likely to wear a facemask when they received autonomy-supportive advice as compared to controlled instructions (Chan et al., 2015).

<p>Is this how 2020 public health has been handled? Would this even be allowed to be written today? </p>
<p>And I’m not even going to go into the “if you all wore masks there wouldn’t be a need for lockdowns” I think your own country, Australia proved that false. 4 months of dystopian and authorian measures. That wouldn’t fly here, it’s simply not possible. </p>
<p><strong>To summarize, in 2020 we have been gaslit, fed contrary information, been subjected to lockdowns unprecedented in modern times, and had laws enacted outside the normal channels though Emergency means. I think we can see why conspiracy theories thrive in this environment.</strong></p>

        <p>No, I do not believe that BS. Covid is a hoax and hospitals have been empty. I been to numerous hospitals the media claim are full of the sick and dying, and not a damn thing was going on.Im also a teacher teaching English at over 17 schools per week, I’m around 1,000’s of kids a day and numerous staff. NOT one single child or staff member has been sick since March. In fact, no one around has been sick nor collapsing out in public.Absolutely nothing is going on besides governments and media lying and corrupt PCR test claiming people are sick. Only sickness around lately is the common cold or flu which they claim is Covid.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The hospital my grandmother was killed in is in Tennesse, and my family says nothing was going on there. It was pretty dead and no crisis.</p>

        <p>I see. And yet billions of people around the world agree this is real. It would take a massive coordination to create this conspiracy - humans are not that capable. Is it not smarter to follow the science. </p>
<p>The same science you use which created your phone? Or was that science fake too? </p>
<p>I know it is a scary world, but you dont have to live in fear of a massive hoax. You can have a real respect for a virus - which has nothing to do with smalltown american politics. There is a big world out here. Please join us before more of your people die.</p>

        <p>THE science. The Bible. This religious cult of scientism is abhorrent with the control it has stolen from our lives. Quit using fear to support totalitarianism. I don’t care if the virus is real or not. All viruses are deadly. But inalienable human rights are exactly that, they don’t disappear “cuz Covid” or “cuz Science”. In support of your dogma you are willing to take away each and every one of our freedoms. You will use emotional manipulation, gaslighting, shaming whatever it takes to further the goals of this anti-human cult. Destroy what makes us human, human connection itself. Your attempt at compassion hasn’t done a good enough job at disguising your true intentions. If you attack my rights I will fight for them no matter what authority you claim to have. Give me liberty or give me death.</p>

        <p>Ah Australia, a lovely place full of murderers. The place which thought it was ok to let four kids with a treatable heart condition die thanks to covid restrictions. What about the people who died thanks to their treatments being cancelled? Not all families are alive and whole so I’d retract that part if I were you.</p>
