    <strong>The history of Australia's eradication efforts, will it work for COVID?</strong>
    <p><p>So  Aus (and NZ by extension) has pursued an eradication strategy when it  comes to Sars-Cov-2 / COVID. Why did Australia pursue this strategy? And  how well has it worked historically?</p>
<p>Australia  has a history of invasive species.  Caused by  accident/circumstance/ignorance (Rabbits, Camels) or deliberate (Cane  Toads). [Know of others, leave a comment]. As an aside - one could also  state that Australia tried to control the native Aborigine  population...anyway....</p>
<p>So, is COVID like an "Invasive species?" Does the philosophy of the past influence the strategy for COVID?</p>
<p>The lengths which Australia has gone in order to rectify these situations is legendary - for those in the know.</p>
<p>Here  are some links. What do you think? Will Australia's COVID eradication  strategy work in the years to come? Or is it just delaying the  inevitable?</p>

        <p>If they keep mandatory quarantine for incoming visitors then maybe they can keep this virus out, but not guaranteed.  The damage it would do to the economy and way of life is huge.  It also doesn't do anything to stop other zoonotic viruses from popping up within their borders.</p>
<p>Really, the idea of hiding from mild respiratory viruses is crazy and in line with OCD type mental illness.</p>
