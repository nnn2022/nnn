    <strong>My grandfather has COVID</strong>
    <p><p>He's 77 and in poor health. Mentally, I've been prepared for him to pass away for a few years, and so had he. Right now he has pneumonia, and my dad is going to live with him for a a few weeks to help him out then quarantine at his house. What really hits me though is this: God forbid he actually ends up in the hospital from this, I wont be able to see him. His siblings and children won't be able to. He has moderate dementia, so he wouldn't know what was happening. The possibility of him dieing is sad, but it's natural. That he would have to do so alone is evil. This "new normal" is destroying lives. It's destroying families. It's making it so we can't connect with each other on a basic emotional level. I genuinely don't know what to do from here.</p>
<p>Edit: Guys, he's not dead. I appreciate the sentiment, but don't say "sorry for your loss" when there hasn't been one yet. I'm worried about a potential situation.</p></p>

        <p>You are absolutely right, what they are doing in the name of cOvID is an abomination to humanity.</p>
<p>I know a WWII vet that was left to die alone away from his family, then left to sit in a morgue for months in the name of a fake pandemic because Arlington wouldn't let family in for a burial.  And all of this went on  while in the meantime the animals danced in the streets and burned buildings to the ground in the name of a fake civil rights violation.</p>
<p>Yet here we are living through a REAL civil rights violation all while the ACLU and the left sit on the sidelines cheering it on.</p>
<p>Do whatever you can to fight for him to stay at home.</p>

<p>Yes, I've focused on the economic side of things, but you made a valid point. What we are doing to COVID patients that we don't even let them to say goodbye to family members is just criminal.</p>
<p>I hope it gets better.</p>

        <p>Keep positive for him and your family. IF it does get bad for him see if there are hospice options to get him home with loved ones. That's what we did with my grandfather. Luckily my family was able to be with him. And tell him you love him.</p>

        <p>Don’t give up hope.  My father came through and his immune system is terrible from cancer therapy and germ phobia,  compulsive hand washing, not going out anywhere.  I can’t believe it.  He was the biggest doomed we have and the paranoia was unbelievable.  No one else got it.</p>

        <p>I know. He's had it a few days and hasn't gotten that much worse. Him getting it did make me consider the above though, which while I had thought about before, never felt real until now. </p>
<p>I'm also worried about my dad deciding to go live there for a few weeks because he is absolutely overestimating his own health.</p>

        <p>It’s ok buddy.  It’s a grim situation yes, but don’t forget, even in his old age, If he was in decent health prior then he has a very good chance on pulling thru.  Go see him (if you can) or FaceTime/ Skype if you can’t, talk about the good times, family events/trips, what you want to do this year, whatever.  Keep his spirits up, let him know he is loved and he’s got a much better chance.</p>

        <p>Buddy, I’m sorry to hear this. My grandpa was in the hospital for it. He just wanted to come home and obviously we couldn’t see him.  I hope the best for you and family.   Best you can do is be available to help your father by offering to bring him whatever they may need and listen to you father.  I had to be the errand boy when my family got it. Was happy to help.   </p>
<p>You sound like you are being realistic about his age and condition. My grandpa had really bad lungs and was 86, I was not surprised at all that he died with it. My grandma has Alzheimer’s and got over covid. So it’s some crazy shit.</p>
