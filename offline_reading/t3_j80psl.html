<p>To do what they must to get votes, to work in their own self interest and to sell out to special interests for campaign funds.</p>

        <p>You're not wrong, but I think, in this case, many politicians are currently attempting to use their power to mold the world into what they want it to, via the "reset" they keep spouting off about.</p>

        <p>It's true.  And idealist politicians are particularly hard to get a handle on because of it. </p>
<p>I'm reminded of a formative experience.  Back in the '70s as a young man I had the opportunity to spend a couple of days with my US Representative.  One thing he said has always stuck in my mind.</p>
<p>"If you don't believe what you are doing is right and just, you shouldn't be running for office.  If you do believe that, then your first and formost duty is actually to be elected and re-elected.  If you aren't in the office you can't do anything. "</p>
<p>It hammered home to me that no matter how idealist, a politician's first god will always be popularity and votes.</p>

<p>It's a vicious, nasty cycle that continues to be perpetuated, even for idealistic politicians. They must become popular and earn votes, and most people gravitate towards politicians who are: 1) snarky, "clever" assholes that they love to hate, and/or 2) those who can promise them free stuff and other things that can benefit them. Often for #2, politicians outright lie about these things, which corrupts them because then they begin to habitually lie as well. Truly idealistic leader can't exist because they rarely come into power, and the ones who start out that way, tend to fall from grace by the time they enter office.</p>

        <p>This to the 1000th degree. What's even more frustrating is that people in my life who I know to always question the government and who find moderate distrust of politicians to be reasonable and healthy, have fallen hook, line and sinker for this. For example one person I know believes that the moon landing was faked, that 9/11 was an inside job, that the government secretly kills blacks and keeps our birth rates down, however she looks at me like I have TWO HEADS whenever I suggest that some of the info about this virus has been fabricated and/or sensationalized. The brainwashing has been so strong.</p>

        <p>Interestingly enough, Margaret Sanger started planned parenthood to kill off black babies so the theory that the government secretly kills blacks is not far off. I think lots of people woke up to 9/11 after wondering how building 7 untouched collapsed. Good stuff to chat about. Sad your friend is being brainwashed by the "were stronger together" "stay home, stay safe" crowd.</p>

        <p>Happens to the best of us, everyone has that one weakness that ropes them in sometimes, especially depending on the climate at the time or what's happening in people's personal lives. Despite knowing it's all bullshit coming from a military family as well as serving myself for a 4 year stint, I somehow got sucked in to the 2016 election for a bit, not proud. But after I re-deactivated fb, and stop watching/listening to people who watched the news, I got my head together.</p>
<p>My step father, 20 yrs retired military intelligence, will be the first to tell you how the CIA invented and/or brought crack to the ghettos to destabilize the black communities and inner cities, but because of his 2-3 tours in Afghanistan, refuses to believe anything relating to 9/11. Just a matter of how close you are to the subject at hand.</p>

        <p>The problem that demoralized people have is seeing beyond their presumption that we must believe the way we do because we support Trump, which of course is not true and is immaterial in the first place. To even try to redpill someone so ideologically bound to something like the two-party system is hopeless. Some people will just never be able to see.</p>

        <p>Honestly I don’t think anyone does anymore to a large degree, take this election for example you’ve got someone who isn’t a politician, someone who’s whole platform is ‘draining the swamp’ versus anyone who isn’t Orange man, there’s no enthusiasm for Biden, there’s no one who could tell you a single thing he supports he’s just not Trump, that’s his biggest selling point to his base.</p>

        <p>Exactly why I didn't vote for a politician for President in 2016. And why I am voting for a non-politician again. The only thing I don't like is that to gain votes he had to appeal to the brainwashed covid/mask wearing sheep with developing a vaccine.  Although, I do believe that he isn't going to mandate it/make it law to take the vaccine since there are what he calls therapeutics (hydroxychloroquine, zine and azythromycin....as well as steroids and others) to treat the flu, coronaviruses, pneumonia, before they develop into a cytokine storm and/or sepsis.</p>

        <p>We all can help ourselves by electing constitutional representatives and learning how our State and Federal Constitutions protect us from this covid nonsense now.
I have a couple igit coworkers who consistently make the workplace toxic. Currently, they have attempted to come at me from the covid mandates not being followed by me from day one of our seasonal work start date of April. We are near the end of our season, Oct. 31.
But the constitutions protect me from being harrassed or fired by my employer (contractor) or on site federal worksite point of contact (they don't consistently mask up either).</p>
<p>The stupid coworker who if not for the contract going to a new contractor last year, would otherwise have been not asked to return/essentially fired if the contract had remained with the former one.</p>
<p>See Peggy Hall's website that is growing with legal forms and information she and lawyers are creating with an all states clearinghouse being developed so we can find like minded in our communities or close enough to meet/communicate online. </p>
<p>If someone develops usable information, they are encouraged to e-mail her so she can add it to the clearinghouse.

The message is getting stronger.......so add your voice.</p>

        <p>I trust him more than most politicians. He talks about topics that conspiracy theorists have long warned about (deep state/shadow govt, globalists/globalism, permanent bureaucrat class always wanting war, etc).</p>

        <p>If I need my toilet repaired, I call a plumber, not a celebrity.  When my brakes go out, I call an auto mechanic, not a businessman.  When I can't stop shitting myself, I phone my doctor, not a jackass.</p>
<p>Are politicians corrupt?  Of course they fucking are.  But their job is politics.  Saying that someone who knows absolutely nothing about the job is better than someone whose entire life is the job is beyond stupid to me.</p>
