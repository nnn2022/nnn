    <strong>My grandmother got COVID and I hope she’s going to be ok.</strong>
    <p><p>I don’t agree with any of the ideas on this sub. I am pro-mask, pro-lockdown, and believe that COVID-19 is generally a public safety threat. I live in a place where people tend to ignore COVID rules (a place in Texas), so that’s probably what she got it from. She’s 84 and no underlying health conditions. However, if she does die I will be very angry at the people who do not take this seriously. I know that she’s 84 and you can just say she will die soon, but all of her three siblings have made it to ninety.</p></p>

        <p>Anti-masker me, had a talk with the moderators of this subreddit, you can blame me for having posts like these.</p>
<p>Please don't lower their karma. They should be encouraged to give their opposing viewpoints.</p>
<p>Who ever is proven wrong or otherwise, they can learn from their mistakes or change their minds. Let our subreddit allow both sides of the argument. Therefore pro-masker's can't call us a cult, because a cult disallows outsider's viewpoints and censors information.</p>
<p>Again, I am pro-NO-new-normal, non-compliant, anti-mask, etc.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry for your loss but I’ll echo what the others have said. </p>
<p>Beyond that, why this aggressive, unnecessary need to place blame? If this had happened a year ago and your grandma had gotten the flu and died you wouldn’t have done the same, it’d just be “she was old and couldn’t make it though the flu, how sad, we’ll miss her”. Now a year later essentially the same exact situation just a different disease and it’s all “fuck you and it’s your fault and one of the workers at her facility did this to her and all of you are awful people”. </p>
<p>There’s literally no difference other than that this go-around you’ve been fed this propaganda bullshit that somehow the health of everyone else on the globe is your responsibility too and there has to be someone to blame for each death from <em>a contagious disease</em> that’s just doing what contagious diseases do. Have you ever wondered how many people have spread the flu around? How it may have gone down the line until it hit someone like your grandma and killed them? Have you ever felt mad at people for being out and about maskless during flu season in the past? I’m going to say with confidence that no you haven’t. This is no different whatsoever. </p>
<p>Nobody did this to your grandma. Old people are generally more vulnerable to diseases, and that’s what happened here. Expecting everyone to give up their lives to give your grandma a few more possible years in a care home (not a great life anyway more than likely, and unlikely she would have had a few years left anyway) is selfish. You say that her siblings made it to 90 like she was guaranteed that herself. Truth is nobody is guaranteed even another day and expecting people to give up theirs completely for your grandma to try and hit that completely arbitrary, not at all guaranteed number is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Look I'm very sorry, I sincerely hope the best for you and your family. But I'm not willing to sacrifice the childhood and future of my 3 year old so your grandma can live to 90. Why can't your grandma just quarantine? Why does everyone else, who's not at risk of covid, have to give up their lives for you?</p>

        <p>Ah, yes, blame those that don't take this seriously for cases. Not like california, where its taken very seriously, and the cases are just as high. I wish the best for your grandmother, we all have family too, and don't want anyone harmed.</p>
<p>That said, I also have kids, and won't sacrifice their childhood and social experience for anyone, and asking them to do so would be incredibly selfish on your part.</p>

        <p>Thank you, but I will have to disagree with the California part. Being a large and diverse state, we have millions people like teenagers who don’t care. Because California is largely liberal, people perceive it as being careful but we have to look at everyone. In general, I would say Californians are pretty careless with the whole thing.</p>
<p>Second, I understand that staying home can have severe negative impacts on many people. But you can always have a large FaceTime party, or even a gathering with social distancing and masks. I know there are many people saying you should only be staying home, but you can go out and socialize as long as you follow two very important and easy things that will do enough to curb the spread.</p>

        <p>Look at mask and lockdown compliance numbers anywhere you like. Increased levels don't correlate to decreases in cases, icu, or mortality. Even those involved in mask studies (recent zdogg interview) don't claim it reduces spread. There's no reason to believe either behavior can be successful.</p>
<p>Kids get little to nothing from more screen time. They need in person interaction. Tackling each other. Sharing germs is actually vital for immune system development. They need to touch, need to be kids. They need to see faces to learn emotions, language, feel loved and supported. Much of Europe never even closed schools because they realized, unlike most of the us, how vital that is. These kids don't get a second chance at these brain-critical developmental years. We'll be years understanding how much harm we've caused them.</p>
<p>Would your grandmother really support pulling kids from school, prevent them from having friends for a year, for her own well being? My 91yo grandmother does not. She still sees her great grandchildren because they bring her joy. She'd rather see them even if there is a small risk than spend her last few years without then.</p>

        <p>I think masks work to the extent where they shouldn't be mandatory, about 5% effective.  It logically makes sense, it has to block at least a respiratory droplet. Could you please disprove me if you may, that masks don't work roughly at all.  Send me that interview please.</p>
<p>All in all, I don't have enough scientific evidence to convince me covid-19 even exists in the first place.</p>

        <p>So you're doing your part saving granny by wearing a dirty, bacteria filled rag over your mouth?? Are you sure it wasn't you that infected granny? One of the things about masks is it gives people a false sense of security, they think it stops the virus when that's laughably incorrect.</p>

        <p>Anyone who is pro lock down is a puppet as far as I’m concerned . I’m sorry but 84 year old woman are not my problem. The world can not be locked down because people on their last leg may die from a cold the flu could kill them just as easily. There is no “conspiracy theories” there is no “theory” when we base it on things the selected puppets say and do. </p>

        <p>I post on the sub because it’s the only alternative to one sided leftest the echo chamber that is reddit. 
2. There is no “theories” for me I base all my beliefs on observations I see in the world and things elite leaders say such as gates / world economic forum and so forth. I don’t focus on “theories”
I analyze my beliefs based on things that are said and the events that unfold before me. </p>
<p>Anyway here we are again another npc shill. 
Where is any “truth” there is no proven truth masks work there is no proven truth vaccines work, and isn’t it funny we have all these illnesses no one could make a vaccine for eons and in 1 year they made one magically for “covid” isn’t it funny they had a event prior to covid discussing what would happen if a virus was to occur just like covid. These are puzzle pieces that fit together anyone with half a brain can deduce. </p>
<p>Anyway don’t you have some communist larping to do on r/politics ?</p>

But if you want to trust your government with every facet of your life... that’s your choice. But we have seen Cuba / nazi Germany/ Russia / North Korea/ communist China etc and we have seen some of the concepts selected leaders want to do with our governmental systems it’s leads
Towards communism. Might want to look into the world economic forum and their agenda. </p>
<p>Second of of I don’t care what you are I’m saying this agenda is an agenda for global communism. Anyway keep sucking big brothers dick.
Let me ask you though are you cool giving up
Everything you own ina. Few years and renting everything from the government ? Because that is the world we are headed towards
If we don’t speak up against this agenda.</p>
<p>Anyway I can see nothing I say will change your mind as you are a npc shill so good luck bro I hope big brother gives you a nice anal

        <p>No freedom? I’d love you to talk about your rights being violated by a shitty government when there are millions in North Korea who are starving and will get shot for not bowing down at a portrait of their leader. As for us, we can speak all we want about the government (not that they’ll listen) and roam freely if we have masks. Seriously, just wear a damn mask.</p>

Second of all we can barely speak if you haven’t seen there is censorship and ccp puppets running show not allowing anyone in social media to speak against the government. If we keep allowing mindsets like yours we will end up like North Korea. Take your mask and shove it up your ass</p>

        <p>What you’re describing seems very tragic yet I don’t think you even realize. It sounds like your grandmother with dementia was deprived of social and familial contact for the last year of her life. The value of life is not a mere function of its duration. Personally, I would strongly prefer to risk catching an infectious disease and dying than to spend a year of my life isolated and, if I had dementia, confused and afraid.</p>

        <p>So, its safe to say that the people she came into contact with were wearing masks when they had direct contact with her? I say this because I am assuming that you and your family do not allow anyone to directly interact with your grandmother if they aren't wearing a mask. Is that accurate?</p>

        <p>The poster had the balls to enter our sub and attempt to dispute us.  We should be proud, I think the poster views us in a entirely new light after their failed attempt.  Most often, pro-maskers are programed by mainstream media to stay away from us, mistaking us for "lunatic conspiracy theorists".  That stops with poster's like this.</p>

        <p>Thats sad, I’m so sorry. </p>
<p>My grandmother is in her late 80’s with COPD, caught covid in December and survived. She’s feelin’ real good now. I haven’t seen her since the covid started.</p>
<p>However, it also furthered my anti-mask, anti-lockdown ideology.</p>
<p>I also had covid early on, but lived and chillin’ and that was before I was anti-mask, anti-lockdown, etc.</p>
<p>Hope your grandmother pulls through though.</p>

        <p>Your grandmother does NOT have Covid. She has a mere minor cold or the flu but took the bogus PCR test, came out positive and they tell her it’s Covid. They’ll probably throw her on a ventilator and kill her like they did my grandma, who coughed a few times and they said it’s Covid and drowned her on a ventilator she did not need.  </p>

        <p>tell that to the mom of the 10 year old kid that  hung himself because of lockdowns... but we have to save the people that have  already lived their lives and are just waiting to die ...</p>
<p>that might sound  callous but I would rather save a 10 year olds life than grandma and I sure grandma would feel the same way.</p>

        <p>Hopefully she's okay but people that age can die at any point.  If you thought the area she was living in, did you try to help her move?  People where I live "take this seriously" and there has been a full year for her to move to such a place.</p>

        <p>It's all good. Grandpa lived a fulfilling life, and has done great things. The last thing he would want is someone feeling sorry. I hope your grandmother pulls through. It is a long and rough recovery, but they are much better at it now than they were at the start of the pandemic.</p>

        <p>Seems like you just want something to pin the blame on so you can ignore the harsh reality of things.</p>
<p>The reality is when the world is overpopulated, a virus comes along to clean things up.</p>
<p>If you want to stop the virus you are selfish and you don't care about children or the future generations.</p>
