    <strong>I cannot begin to thank this community enough for keeping me sane</strong>
    <p><p>First off, I’ll say this about my family - they mean well, I love them, I’m sure they love me. However, the last twelve months I’ve endured more negative comments belittling my intelligence all because I don’t agree with them about covid/the vaccine, and our Canadian politics. </p>
<p>My brother says I think covid is a hoax. I’ve never said that, nor do I believe that. My dad says I’m anti-vaxx. I’ve gotten flu shots every year until last year when the flu no longer mattered. They know I have an auto-immune that creates a ton of inflammation both internally and externally, especially in my esophagus, where at times I spend 2-3 hours feeling like I’m choking on acid from my stomach. Due to the amount of reports coming out of people who have dealt with inflammation of their heart, including a friend of mine from work who also had inflammation in his spleen, I’m reluctant to take something that hasn’t been fully approved (which ironically my family didn’t even know) that could possibly create more inflammation in my body. I also had covid last year and wouldn’t you know it, I survived. </p>
<p>Then I come across this sub last year after feeling alone and like an outcast. While I’ve seen some comments that seem extreme, the general consensus in this sub is that the lockdowns and vaccine requirements are over the top. I needed to read your comments to know I’m not going crazy, that there are still people who think critically. I needed to see actual sources from some of the posts that lend credibility to the covid vaccine detractors. And most of all, I just needed the sense of community. I appreciate you all, even those who might come in here to respectfully disagree with my stances</p></p>

        <p>Dude, you should ask them if they plan on taking the boosters that Trudeau got for us. We are all set for boosters up until and including 2024. </p>
<p>They don't want to be an anti-vax do they? So they're going to need to take their experimental boosters.</p>

        <p>Honestly they don’t know that much aside from what they see on CNN. And if they were glued solely to Fox too, I’d say the same thing, but the 24 hour news channels are designed to stir some kind of emotion so you’re locked into viewing all the time. It just frustrates me. </p>
<p>But yeah, I’ll have to bring that up. They have mentioned they’re confused about the possibility of future restrictions in the fall if almost everyone is vaccinated anyway, so they’re starting to question some things</p>

        <p>Do they know the vaccine doesn't prevent a person from getting covid?</p>
<p>Do they know that the vaccine doesn't prevent a person from transmitting covid?</p>
<p>Do they know that the vaccine doesn't make their covid symptoms any less? That it could make them worse?</p>
<p>I still don't know why people are talking about how the unvaccinated need to take this vaccine in order to protect other people? It's like everyone is refusing to acknowledge the simple facts of this vaccine. It doesn't do what it's supposed to do, not even a little bit. And that's very suspicious.</p>

        <p>The buzzwords in BC was “do our part” which has been repeated to me a few times. I’d imagine they know that any vaccine isn’t a magic force field that means you’ll never get sick, but my point was just that if they have it, then it shouldn’t matter what I or anyone else does. But it’s still not good enough</p>

        <p>It’s getting to that point where I’m going to remind them of when I was hospitalized in January due to my esophagus closing up to the point of feeling like I was drowning. That kind of effect from inflammation due to eating food that was too acidic was bad enough but I agree, if I suddenly developed some heart problems due to a vaccine, I’m not sure how they’d react.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the kind words, it’s mutual. Like I said, the sub has overwhelmingly been just questioning the logic of a lot of decisions and I haven’t seen too many disrespectful comments to others who are pro vaxx or pro lockdown or whatever, which tells me I’m in the right place. I don’t want to create further divisions in my personal life but I’m being pushed further away at this stage, so the sense of community on here is refreshing</p>

        <p>I’m sorry your family treated you that way. It says a lot about you that you still see the good in them. I think a lot of us probably know how it feels to have loved ones attack us with their criticism, myself included. It’s hard to go through that, but I’m glad you don’t feel alone anymore. Keep your head up, things <em>will</em> get better. They’ve created a culture of attacking people who disagree because they know their ideas can’t stand against criticism.</p>

        <p>They’re good people, it’s just weird that they act so open minded until someone has a different opinion and then they insult their intelligence. If they said “hey we don’t agree with you but why do you think that way” it would be different but it hasn’t been, it’s just been insults. I’m just losing some faith in my country and the people running it, but I saw our PM shaved so I’m guessing we’re having an election soon</p>
