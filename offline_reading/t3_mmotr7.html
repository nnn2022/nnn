    <strong>Could a Vaccine cause an imbalance in the worldwide sex ratio?</strong>
    <p><p>First of, I understand that a lot of people here might not be religious or some might even oppose religions, which is why I almost didn't want to make this post. But then I remembered that people here tend to be more open minded and civil. Just for sake of discussion, pretend that this scenario could happen.</p>
<p>In Islam, one of the signs that the day of Judgment is nearing, is that there will be an imbalance in the sex ratio, a massive one. I don't think this would be the result of a war, because for one, men would mostly reject fighting, if women didn't fight either - after all the gender equality push. On the other hand, even if men did fight exclusively, would that be enough to cause such a disparity in numbers?</p>
<p>Then I wondered if a vaccine, especially one of this kind, changing DNA and such, could be a reason for this. </p>
<p>“<em>The signs of the Hour include the scarcity of knowledge, the manifestation of ignorance, the display of adultery, the abundance of women, and the decrease of men to the extent that for fifty women there will be one man.</em>” In another narration: “<em>And you will see one man followed by forty women.</em>” </p>
