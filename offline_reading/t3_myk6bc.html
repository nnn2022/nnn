        <p>(Sorry for copy paste can't figure out how to link posts)</p>
<p>It's people falling sick from the vaccines. 90% of the "serious" there cases I know are people who just took a vaccine dose within the past 2 weeks. </p>
<p>These are different vaccines than the ones in the US, they have Astrazeneca and a locally developed one called Covaxin that is pumped full of toxic aluminium known for provoking a heavy immune response that's similar to Covid itself (what isn't?). </p>
<p>The rest of it is just letting fear and panic and India's extended family peer pressure driving them into the medical pharma death mill. All of the supposed "new wave" is happening in the exact cities where vaccine uptake was the highest. </p>
<p>And my personal sampling confirms this. Im Indian living overseas, parents are still there. Including my parents, around 15 of the 25 people I know that took a vaccine got horrible "Covid" within 2 weeks. </p>
<p>Parents were perfectly healthy for 400 days of this "pandemic", got scared for no reason and took the vaccine against all my pleading, fell horribly sick with persistent high fever within 2 weeks, got pressured into tests and tested positive for Covid (despite having zero external contact within those 2 weeks). </p>
<p>Nosy doomer relatives further pressured them into 2 different courses of antibiotics (for a supposed virus! In case anyone not aware, antibiotics only work on bacteria not viruses), pressured into multiple daily tests, MRIs etc. which led to high doses of corticosteroids, stomach pump inhibitors, antivirals and dozens of other powerful pharma meds, side effects made them miserable and unable to eat, and almost got pressured into the hospital (where I'm sure more lovely "cures" awaited them, as they have for the dozens I know that went and never came back). </p>
<p>Luckily they started to believe me, we let the steroids suppress what I suspect was the craxy vaccine reaction (autoimmune disorder / cytokine storm) tapered off the meds and they got much better, after much suffering.</p>
<p>It's a genocide. But not from some virus. From the fear of a virus driving people into the vaccines and medical pharmaceutical complex. India and its brainwashed doomer culture is easy pickings.</p>

        <p>I just talked to my insurance agent who is from India. His family still lives there. He said that it's not an issue. They have not been having issues all year. We talked for a long while. He even said that America's media has reported things falsely about his home town. His family said they were more worried about him being here since America is losing its mind.</p>

        <p>Has anyone looked at the possibility it could be another pathogen.  The world is so Covid crazy they've ruled trauma deaths as Covid.  What if there's a biologic weapon running through India now?</p>
<p>I do find it a little too coincidental that India, Cambodia and Qatar all had their "Covid" deaths spike about a week after mass vaccinations went underway.</p>

        <p>A country of a billion and God know how much more. Terrible living conditions, underdeveloped healtcare system, poor hygiene, high density. Those are the moments the UN has to intervene and help handle the spike. The links to the start of the vaccination campaing and the surge are there, same thing happened in Europe. Overall the Indian variant is probably the new argument for lockdown 4. We all know they will play Covid-21 card. In the end it will be the same shit as muh British variant</p>

        <p>Listen this is like discussing like a wall. I'm from india, I'm telling you what is happening and you think I'm scaremonegering or exaggerating.  I'm pretty sure you don't even believe on news, because you probably think they are for sheeps, but you'll see how horribly it is. And no, hospitals hasn't always been full, right now there is a lack of oxygen tanks, so many countries have been helping us, yet we sadly need more. Clearly you have never been on a 3 world country.

        <p>I am from a 3rd world country and the poverty levels in India are worse than the ones I have seen. I have Indian friends whose families are in India and reject the narrative that is being pushed by the media. If C19 was as bad as they make it seem, the 100s of millions of slum dwellers would have long-since been wiped out. If a country has more than a 1/3 of the world's malnutrition-stunted children, then it's definitely a poor country.</p>

        <p>You are seeing surges in Michigan and other states that have had high vax uptake.</p>
<p>Oddly enough the States that have done away with mask mandates and social distancing, who have opened their schools and public places, tend to have high vax reluctance, if not out right resistance. These are the states with the lowest case, hospitalization, and fatalities.</p>
<p>But nice try though 👌</p>
<p>Thailand is very similar to India fyi.</p>
<p>Who knows, the the same people that brought us these vaccines also knowingly sold HIV infected blood to latin america, brought us the opiod epidemic, pay hundreds of millions to billions in damages to people they injur and kill (Phizer having the largest at 2.3 billion) and who go to court multiple times a year for altering, destroying, faking, and or corrupting clinical trial data.</p>
<p>Once again. Correlation doesn't cause causation, but its the best place to start as not only is it usually right, but the obsfucation around COVID and big pharma leaves it as one of the few leads one can actually track that they cannot hide or suppress.</p>

        <p>Curious how you came to that conclusion. Looking at the table plenty of states with a mask mandate have falling case rates. And how would your conclusion make sense anyway? I've heard the argument here that masks don't <em>prevent</em> the spread of covid but how would they <em>increase</em> it?</p>

<p><em>You</em> did when it seemed like cases supported your argument. You brought up  case # multiple times.</p>

        <p>Sorry my use of common sense if throwing you for a loop.</p>
<p>How would mask wearing increase hospitalization?  </p>
<p>Gee I don't know how that is possible when you strap a petri dish to your face every day to breath in, while the most important thing to prevent COVID is not to touch your face. What do people do when they are forced to wear a mask, they touch their face all damn day. </p>
<p>Not to mention places that enforce masks also enforce lock downs and aggressive social distancing policies. So staying at home, not excercising, less sunlight, diminished social interactions. Nah man that wouldn't possibly suppress your immune system.</p>
<p>If only you could compare places with panicked, overreaching, inept public health policies in regards to places that use a common sense data driven approach.</p>
<p>If you only could compare California, Michigan, New York to say Texas and Florida. Wow that would really shed some light on who is right!</p>
<p>If only we could have had the foresight to think that California, NY, Pennsylvania, NJ, and Michigan stuffing COVID positive patients in with the elderly would have caused 22% of all COVID deaths in America. Who could possibly known this was a terrible idea? Outside of course anyone with an IQ higher than the current outside temperature.</p>
<p>Your side got it wrong my man. Just admit it so we can all move on with living life.</p>

        <p>Case numbers remain relatively stable in India for an entire year.</p>
<p>They start mass vaccinations in January.</p>
<p>Case numbers and deaths start skyrocketing right after.</p>
<p>But this has nothing to do with the vaccine.</p>

        <p>People falling sick from the vaccines. 90% of the "serious" there cases I know are people who just took a vaccine dose within the past 2 weeks. </p>
<p>The rest of it is just letting fear and panic and India's extended family peer pressure driving them into the medical pharma death mill. All of the supposed "new wave" is happening in the exact cities where vaccine uptake was the highest. </p>
<p>And my personal sampling confirms this. Im Indian living overseas, parents are still there. Including my parents, around 15 of the 25 people I know that took a vaccine got horrible "Covid" within 2 weeks. </p>
<p>Parents were perfectly healthy for 400 days of this "pandemic", got scared for no reason and took the vaccine against all my pleading, fell horribly sick with persistent high fever within 2 weeks, got pressured into tests and tested positive for Covid (despite having zero external contact within those 2 weeks). </p>
<p>Nosy doomer relatives further pressured them into 2 different courses of antibiotics (for a supposed virus! In case anyone not aware, antibiotics only work on bacteria not viruses), pressured into multiple daily tests, MRIs etc. which led to high doses of corticosteroids, stomach pump inhibitors, antivirals and dozens of other powerful pharma meds, side effects made them miserable and unable to eat, and almost got pressured into the hospital (where I'm sure more lovely "cures" awaited them, as they have for the dozens I know that went and never came back). </p>
<p>Luckily they started to believe me, we let the steroids suppress what I suspect was the craxy vaccine reaction (autoimmune disorder / cytokine storm) tapered off the meds and they're starting to get better, after much suffering.</p>
<p>It's a genocide. But not from some virus. From the fear of a virus driving people into the vaccines and medical pharmaceutical complex. India and its brainwashed doomer culture is easy pickings.</p>

        <p>I'm actually shocked it didn't happen earlier, India is absolutely disgusting its so dirty that it makes China look like a sanitized operating room in comparison. I remember one article from a little while ago that said they put flesh eating turtles into the Ganges to get rid of all the dead bodies floating in it... They will blame the variant but I think we all know it's Indians filthy life style that caused it</p>
