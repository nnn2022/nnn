    <strong>Reality of Covid</strong>
    <p><p>Question:- Are these globalists capable of manufacturing a virus and release it to declare a pandemic?</p>
<p>Answer:- Yes, absolutely!</p>
<p>Question:- Do they really need a virus to declare/create a pandemic like situation?</p>
<p>Answer:- Not at all, they need to create a perception using MSM and play with statistics then you have sheeple believing it.</p>
<p>Question:- Can they release an actual virus while having sheeple believe a fake pandemic?</p>
<p>Answer:- yes absolutely.</p>
<p>Question:- Do we need lockdown and facemask to protect us when an actual virus is released?</p>
<p>Answer:- No, believing so will make you surrendering to oppression, tyranny and giving up on your freedom. Lockdown makes absolutely no sense, its nothing but making get used to give up their rights to be safe.</p>
<p>So, all in all the debate is not about if there is an actual virus, the question is, are you going to follow everything your government tells you!!
And lastly the vaccine is the thing that you should be concerned about not the virus.</p></p>

        <p>Ok, but even if all of that is true, why would the government need to fake a virus when all it would do is make people angry? I agree, the government has these capabilities, but I cannot believe that they would use these means on their own country for no reason.</p>

        <p>The government may not want to do these things but they can be certainly made to do these,
For example ,  almost every country has debt to pay the world bank, so they will follow whatever they are asked to else face the consequence....point is, believing ur government is the last thing to do.</p>

<p>You mean the same government that said that WTC Building 7 was destroyed by terrorists? Is that the government that you claim would never harm its own citizens to further its selfish goals?</p>

<p>&rt;Are you claiming 911 was a setup by the government?</p>
<p>The same government that lied about the Taliban and Hussein's WMDs? THAT government? If there were no WMDs and well-funded cells in the Afghan mountains what makes you think that the casus belli for the invasion was true? Not much time spent engaged in critical thinking, huh?</p>

        <p>Because faking a virus and creating "triggered" groups of angry people are best used in concert for destabilizing things as a whole and are not mutually exclusive options; any more so than faking a virus and releasing an actual bioweapon guised as the prophylactic for fake virus.  Are you not paying attention to what is happening in the usa and really everywhere in the world nearly? How can you say you wouldnt believe that they WOULD do it when they already are?</p>

        <p>... and it is NOT for no reason- just look at all they can do that they couldn't before the "reason" to grab all that "emergency" power. Look at what they have done already, and what they are already saying the plan is.</p>

        <p>Do you not understand that an engineered global financial collapse is underway already? Or have you also missed all incremental announcements that we are moving toward more world governance? And that they are using all kinds of tactics and engineered "reasons" to actually act on those announcements in an accelerated way? </p>
<p>Does it also escape you that most governments around the world are trying to kill off the idea of nationalism, and are more leaning toward regional federations that gravitate to one of 3 teams, Russia, China, or Nato?</p>
