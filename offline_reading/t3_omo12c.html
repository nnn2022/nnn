    <strong>Sub members from the Balkans?</strong>
    <p><p>Are there any people browsing this sub that are from the Balkans? I am looking for like-minded individuals to discuss what is happening in our area.  </p>
<p>I don't have the option to create a poll, but how many of us are from the Balkans?</p></p>

        <p>Hey, yes, I’m from Balkan.</p>
<p>My take is that people rejected vaccination in large numbers. Government will try new paranoia push during the winter with Delta variant but honestly doubt that even 15-20% of population will take 3rd shoot.</p>
<p>Lately they started some oppressive talk on TV and I see that people respond very negative. Even people that took vaccines are largely against oppression.</p>
<p>We’ll see how it goes but so far I’m thinking we are in good position, especially compared to UK, Canada and other shitholes…</p>
<p>What’s your take?</p>

        <p>They announced that starting September only vaccinated people will be able to attend sporting events. So far, every restriction they announced has been implemented.  </p>
<p>Some people are against taking the vaccine, some are for and want it to be mandatory and then there is a third group of people that doesn't want to get it but will if they need it to travel etc.  </p>
<p>I think it is not as in the UK and Canada but it seems to be slowly getting there unless we push back.   </p>
<p>The media scare tactics are working and it is no longer people against the government. Now it is people for mandatory vaccines and people against it.</p>

        <p>Yeah, but majority of people in Serbia are against vaccination, and I expect that number only to increase with third dose.</p>
<p>Also, not sure about that sentiment that people are mainly one against the other. I feel like public discourse completely changed today versus one year ago.</p>
<p>We went from: “Respect measures”, “Listen to the science”, “Vaccines will save us”</p>
<p>… to: “Government and crisis doctors need to be in jail”, “Vaccines are poison”, “Stop bothering us with that stupid talk” 😂</p>

<p>where I live people are against each other.... sadly there are a lot of posts on social media from young people in their 20s and 30s who support banning unvaccinated people from bars, restaurants. My only hope is that is the 'loud minority', cause a lot of people are speaking up against restrictions</p>

        <p>I am in the radius, Romania, to be exact. The elderly here seem to be getting vaccines, but don’t complain as much. I only arrived here as of recently, and it’s not as bad as it was early. You had schedules here (2 hours to be outside apart of routine), and could be fined for not wearing a mask. We have more public spaces outside, so unless it’s a mall or something we don’t always wear masks. Not even trains enforce it. It’s not as <strong>still</strong> crazy as America currently.</p>

        <p>No, there’s no problems; or restrictions anymore in fact. the curfew has made people not want to lose money, because people got laid off here. Lots of people got vaccinated initially, but now it’s a bit slow. Government didn’t do much except establish curfew, our mayor is kind of a douche who watched what the entire government did and copy it over here, even though he is the reason there’s not much sanitation, or public cleaning. The fountains here from like the 1920’s are like literally used as ashtrays, to paint a picture.</p>

        <p>I spent the last two weeks in Bulgaria where I am originally from. Coming from the west was very refreshing. There is no covid BS here. Very few people are vaccinated. I think 13% are fully vaxed. I don't wear a mask even in the pharmacy and others do the same. People have moved on. Covid is not even interesting. I think it has something to do with not having a regular government since April. There is very little propaganda on TV. If covid is mentioned the TV there is a debate and both sides are discussed.</p>

        <p>How easy is it to get vaccine certificates without getting a vaccine? I figured that people would be paying doctors to just get the papers and throw out the shot.</p>

<p>I wouldn't do it. Our best way out of this madness is to not comply. If the majority of people have a certificate then it will be easier to implement restrictions and rules to the ones that don't want the certificate....</p>

        <p>I’ve thought about that as well, but I’ve thought about traveling and getting a certificate so that I can return to my country without quarantining. The quarantine restrictions for when I return basically make it impossible to visit my family outside of my country.</p>
