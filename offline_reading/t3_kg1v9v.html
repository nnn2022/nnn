<title>this may be a stretch for some of y'all but we're all generally Individualists and Capitalists here so I think we can all generally support this: the Anarcho-Capitalist Party of the USA is now a thing and I'm trying to help get the word out on subs like this that may be interested.</title>

<p>Anarcho-Capitalism may go by many names, such as Voluntarism, Autarchism, Libertarian Anarchism, Pure Capitalism, Pure Libertarianism, and many more, but all these terms describe one simple ideology centered on the Individual's freedom and autonomy, rather than the government's opinions and the collective's rulings.   </p>
<p>We live in a time where individuals, conforming to so called, "Left" or "Right" hive-minds, win the day politically, but these collectives are both the same deep down. They both seek to use the government to enforce their personal beliefs, and warp the economy in unnatural ways. People have forgotten that there is a third way, where individuals are not servants to the state, but rulers over themselves.</p>
<h6>...</h6>
<p>Anarcho-Capitalism is based on these beliefs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Individuals own their body and property.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each individual is unique and has a right to use their own reason to achieve their happiness. This requires that individuals control themselves and their property which they express their will upon</p>
<p>2.The NAP (Non Aggression Principle), "No individual may initiate force against another individual's body or property".</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Nobody, not even the government or a massive corporation, can violate your body or property as an autonomous individual</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>3.The State, or Government is immoral.</p>
<p>Ancapism defines a State as any organized violation of individuals and their property for its own ends. The state robs you of your wealth, creates monopolies, warps the free market, sends its people to war, and invades their privacy.</p>
<p>4.The Community and the Free Market Should replace the State/Government.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Voluntary interaction is always better than a government run on coercion.  </p>
<p>---</p>
<p>when it comes to the coronavirus, we understand that it exists, but Individuals who consent to the risk should be able to de whatever they want with their body and property, as long as they take the needed steps to make sure you don't give the virus to those who don't consent to the risk.</p>
<p>If one doesn't want the disease, stay at home and ask people to stay away from you like bro people who don't care should do as they please as long as they don't affect you.  </p>

        <p>no. you can be an ancap in politics as long as you dont seek to expand the state. its fully within our ideology to hold political power in order to shrink it.</p>

        <p>To be honest with you that sounds exactly like anarcho communist vanguardism that’s lead to millions of deaths.</p>
<p>If you believe that eliminating the state through a vanguard anarcho capitalist state is possible without dictatorship then you’re an insane person.</p>

        <p>we dont want an ancap state, we just want to have an organization that all ancaps can center ourselves on officially. we dont want to try to actually take over the government via elections and use the state to abolish the state. that leads to the pinochet type stuff</p>

        <p>No, you literally have a party platform and define how and why you would change the US through political power.   </p>
<p>And being an Anarcho-capitalist "party" do you not consider the possibility that plenty of your party members hold "abolishing the state" as a primary directive?  Anyone who takes an official position as mayor, city councilman, etc that your "party" supports will be a shining example of cognitive dissonance that can only lead to tyranny.   </p>
<p>I think your conception here is a perversion of the ideology, and something wholly unworthy of support.</p>

        <p>thats just what you do as a party. thats in theory. there is no realistic way we could get massive power in the USA. if we grow large enough to win a presidential election the government would probably find a way to start killing us off lol. </p>
<p>I think you are overthinking it. were just the libertarian party but not filled with weirdos and we have stronger economic beliefs of the austrian school. our mayors would probably just cut out as many taxes as they could and repeal useless local laws. </p>
<p>again were an activism organization mainly</p>
