        <p>See he's basically right but then gets into the weeds about hospitals coping anyway. Really, I don't think that you can entirely dispense with discussions about data, at some point is has to come up. But, you can't lead with it. I also don't agree with talking about intellectual topics like ethics though.</p>
<p>Outside of a handful of highly rational thinkers, nobody is convinced of anything without first being emotionally convinced of it (and none of the people on the other side are highly rational thinkers). You gotta use emotional arguments, if anything. Only talk data if the other person brings up data or if you are trying to use that data to directly embarrass the other person about something they've said (yes really). </p>
<p>Or better yet, persuade people by living your life better than them and never following the rules in the process. Be happier, be friendlier, be a happy smiling unmasked person and signal your opposition of all the insanity. Because if enough people do this then it will break down their group-think and cut at the goal of all the virtue signalling.</p>
