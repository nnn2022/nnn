    <strong>Why I hate the term 'herd immunity'</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not part of a herd. I never was. I am not a sheep, a cow, or a buffalo. I am a human being, capable of thinking for myself, using common sense, and making my own decisions about what's best for the health and well being of my family. My child is not a walking disease vector; he's a person. I have a responsibility to teach him how to observe the world around him, be thoughtful and reflective, and make smart choices based on the information he has in front of him. Not blindly following the taglines spewed relentlessly by politicians, media outlets, and propaganda machines. I refuse to allow him to subscribe to this notion that walking around at school all day with your face covered in paper is normal. It's not. What's normal is covering your mouth when you cough, washing your hands, eating your fruits and vegetables, staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest. You know ... like the stuff that I was taught when I was a kid. That's worked well for me for decades ... why would I need to rethink things now? You know what? I haven't. And, I am doing just fine, thanks.</p>
<p>I refuse to be a part of a "herd" that believes it's okay to turn the world upside down in the face of a naturally occurring phenomenon that we don't (many still don't) understand. I believe firmly that it's okay to admit there is more that we don't know that we do know and that pretending we know everything is at best irrational and unhealthy and at worst flagrantly dishonest.</p>
<p>Herds follow one another without question, because their numbers are their best defense about natural threats. Humans are not a species that moves in herds ... our best defense against natural threats is our ability to think critically and use sound judgement based on what we know of the natural world.</p>
<p>I'm not part of a herd. I'm a man who values the diversity of thought and opinion in society as it makes us great. I am proud of my ability to disagree with others but still respect them. It's one of our greatest strengths ... not blindly following a stampede, running mindlessly away from a perceived threat.</p>
<p>Herds are for grass-grazing cattle who have nothing to worry about except eating as much as they can, producing calves, and avoid getting taken down by a wolf or coyote. They have their place in the world. I have mine. I'd believe it's my brainpower that keeps me alive and well ... not blindly following others I don't know and don't know me and what's best for my family and what personal health decisions make sense for us.</p>
<p>I am compassionate. I care about others. I value freedom, love, and beauty in the world, and I want everyone to be happy and healthy. I know this about myself. I don't need others to tell me what I am and am not. I can decide for myself. Others are free to move in herds if they want to. I choose not to. I choose to live and let live and be who I am. That's what keeps me healthy and sane ... "immunity" from this "herd" mentality.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p></p>

        <p>That‚Äôs very true!!! Same with "consumer". That word drives me batshit crazy. I am not a "consumer" just because I buy something. But they sure do make the "consumer version" of everything crappy so it doesn‚Äôt last long and I have to buy again.</p>

        <p><strong>‚ÄùIn a speech to the World Economic Forum at Davos Switzerland, England‚Äôs Prince Philip,</strong> then President of the World Wildlife Fund International, <strong>told an elite gathering</strong> of the world‚Äôs most influential business and political leaders that <strong>the human population must be treated like so many sheep that must be ‚Äúculled‚Äù to desired size:</strong></p>
<p><em>You cannot keep a bigger flock of sheep than you are capable of feeding. In other words, conservation may involve culling in order to keep a balance between the relative numbers in each species within any particular habitat. I realize that it is a very touchy subject, but the fact remains that mankind is part of the living world and the apparently unending growth of the world‚Äôs human population can only end in a crisis for all life on earth.</em> ^15 </p>
<p><strong>Prince Philip omitted to say who would carry the awesome responsibility to decide on behalf of the entire human species who got culled and who was allowed to survive.  He clearly had an unspoken idea who.</strong></p>
<p>A definite pattern was evident in all the <strong>Rockefeller-backed NGOs using the their supposed environmental concerns</strong> and the alleged ‚Äòenergy crisis‚Äô as their theme in the early 1970s. They were used to instrumentalize an agenda of <strong>resource control ‚Äî calling it ‚Äòconservation‚Äô ‚Äî especially of energy.</strong> ‚ÄòConservation,‚Äô in turn, was to be used to demand <strong>reduction of overall living standards‚Äîausterity.‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>I also hate the term 'herd'.... why not 'community immunity'?Nope.. I get into arguments with people who say "Because it's herd! It's herd! Not commuity!!" which just demonstrates my point :/</p>
<p>"Herd" is close to 'cattle' which is close to 'chatel' which means 'slave'.</p>
