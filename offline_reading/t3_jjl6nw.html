        <p>Well pretty obviously they don’t just let the kids take them off in the classroom, they let the kids one at a time go into a different room where they get a break from keeping a mask on all day, as it would become uncomfortable for younger students</p>

        <p>You must be stupid right? The Ebola virus has an over 90% kill rate and we didn't mask up or shut down. We never did that for tuberculosis that also will kill you far worse than covid. I work in healthcare I see more patients with appendicitis than corona. Get the fuck out of here.</p>

        <p>Yes that's because these diseases had/have lower case and transition rates and that's why we don't have to try and protect ourselves from these ones but yet with covid that is extremely contagious along with the fact that we don't know as much about covid than the other diseases cos those ones have been around for much longer, so stop trying to fight your wrong point and stop coming out with the first piece of shite that you think of without checking or even thinking about it for one second</p>

        <p>My husband and I both had it back in February we lived we haven't been sick since and we've been going to work and out and about everyday since it happened.  Why is so deadly that the media has to tell me about it instead of watching people drop like flies. Most "essential workers" would have died already if it were so deadly. It's so deadly that older people are begging to see their families over fear of a flu. It's so deadly we had to lock people down instead of finding ways to boost their immune system. Anyway you think your way and I'll think mine because the swine flu was worse than this back in 2009.</p>

        <p>This is nowhere near the deadliest disease ever. In fact, it's a very successful virus because of the fact it's harmless and mild to the vast majority. It's in the territory of influenza, only better because unlike influenza it doesn't put both ends of the age spectrum at risk - the very young and very old. </p>
<p>It's so mild for the majority that it will become endemic and join other viruses that cause the common cold and flu. It will be here forever.</p>

        <p>Ok I'll tell you everything wrong with your comment, to begin with I didn't say it was the deadliest disease ever I said it was one of them
2. Covid is a very harmful disease and have left many people's lives distraught no matter how much whining you do about having to wear a mask, just do it it's not hard
3. It will not be here forever if we develop a vaccine for it, yeah sure you'll have the odd case but if we wear a mask, do our part and fucking listen to the smartest people on earth studying this thing you dick</p>

<p>We don't wear masks here. Masks aren't effective. They're not supported by high level evidence. They're also not harmless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I couldn't wear a mask for health reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's not even anywhere near one of the deadliest diseases. Also there are far worse diseases that leave far more people distraught than this virus harmless to the vast majority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The virus WILL be here forever. It will be endemic. A vaccine isn't going to eradicate it, it isn't even going to stop people getting it. Influenza has a vaccine, it's still here and still kills people. ONE virus has been eradicated in all of history, this virus won't be one and it'll join other viruses that cause the "common cold" - and yes those viruses do kill the most vulnerable people.</p>

        <p>Why are masks not harmless to the people who aren't exempt from wearing them, and I said the virus won't be eradicated,I said cases would go down ridiculously just like measles, mumps, flu, and eventually covid</p>

        <p>It’s the same concept as recess lol, if they misbehave then they get longer with mild discomfort, but with no actual harm. If they behave they get to step out of class for a little bit, maybe with one or two friends, and relax six feet apart before coming back inside. They don’t need the mask break, it’s just a kind thing for them to get since masks all day can get uncomfortable.</p>
<p>They’re not “earning air” because they have air anyway, its not like they’re wearing plastic</p>

        <p>Have you guys ever noticed that children can breathe with a mask as well? Literally students in Germany VOLUNTARELY wore a mask when they didnt even have to, because they care about each other. Was even on the news. Luckily they reintroduced mandatory mask rule here again. So ask the kids before making up that shit, Thanks.</p>

        <p>Yeah and the breathe better without and live happier without. You can go fuck yourself, thinking having to earn to not wear a mask is not an objectively horrible thing. Making sure they will never think they can decide anything for themselves God you people are so lost on the bigger picture, no pattern recognition, awareness of history, psychology, sociology, nothing you absolute asshole.</p>

Below the age off 70 and without any major health impairment it's about 0.0002% a percentage calculated from the cdc official death count and the amount of people infected.

        <p>??? Who said that anyone wants a break??? I know you guys are not really grown up in this sub, but why should you take a break, then the intended protection through wearing masks loses its point. This picture is propaganda bullshit from some very confused people dude...</p>

        <p>Mate what are you talking about? You do realize how painstakingly obvious it is that they provide protection. If you don’t want one thing to reach something else you block it. That’s exactly what a mask does, even if it’s not 100 percent perfect</p>

        <p>Yup. Wales deemed a number of things non essential, such as frying pans and kitchen stuff , books, clothes, period sanitary items  and even smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. I think they are reversing it though </p>
