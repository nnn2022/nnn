    <strong>Fact checking sites will be the end of the west.</strong>
    <p><p><strong>TL;DR Fact-checking sites are funded by the people they are protecting, poorly written, and use catchy headlines to enforce the mainstream narrative without actually sharing true facts. In China the tiananmen square massacre is "fact-checked." What's happening in the West now with "fact checking sources" is no different. Sheep are too lazy to even watch a 6-minute alternative viewpoint video, instead preferring to stick to the mainstream headlines.</strong> </p>
<p>Trying to debate fact with anyone indoctrinated in the mainstream narrative is near-impossible due to their reliance on "fact-checking" sites. </p>
<p>These fact checking sites are funded by the very people that they are protecting. It is clear propaganda. </p>
<p>The posts are often terribly written as well. The headline is used to enforce the mainstream narrative, but deep in the article they confess that they really don't know the truth or that "anything is possible." </p>
<p>Furthermore, no sources are used, OR they are bad sources. For example, one "fact-checking" site had a headline saying that XYZ CEO did NOT commit a specific crime. </p>
<p>Their source? "I emailed the CEO and he said he didn't do it." Even a sheep should be able to figure out that asking someone if they did XYZ crime is NOT a source. </p>
<p>But of course the masses just read the headlines because they don't want to deviate from the comfortable position of being in bliss, ignorant agreement with all of the other sheep. </p>
<p>In China if you were to research anything regarding the tiananmen square massacre you would be overloaded with "fact-checking" sites and sources telling you the "truth" about the massacre. </p>
<p>It is abundantly obvious to anyone with a half-functioning brain that "fact-checking" sites are put there by those in power to enforce the narrative they are pushing. </p>
<p>They serve the purpose of allowing the lazy sheep to continue following the "experts" and the "science" and the masses. </p>
<p>And this will lead to the dangerous end of the West. </p>
<p>I tried to share alternative sources to acquaintances that sent me fact-checking sites when I shared something, but they were so easily fragile &amp; triggered that they wouldn't be able to even <em>consider</em> an alternative viewpoint or even watch a 7-minute video on the lab leak theory. This was even after I gave them the respect of listening to their opinion.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah if you haven't taken the red pill by now I think you're a lost cause regarding political knowledge. </p>
<p>No point in wasting time and energy on those anymore. They might wake up once they live in a completely totalitarian society, but then it'll be too late. </p>
<p>Sadly it seems our "leaders" have taken all the lessons from the 20th century and learned exactly the opposite of what they should have learned. 
Instead of small government with little power apart from fulfilling the basic duties like national protection from outside dangers, they have used all the reasons why governments got overthrown in the past and made a pretty watertight system where they can be completely free and even utilize dissent to their advantage.</p>

        <p>And then at the bottom it always says something like “while it is true that Joe Biden says he is going to take your guns away, he doesn’t say he’s going to take them while eating ice cream, so we’ve marked this claim as false.”</p>

<p>They just want someone to tell them that their tribe is right.</p>

        <p>My favorite fact-checkings are the ones on Kary Mullis.</p>
<p>Like, you cant even embed the videos where he very clearly spits some truth. Yet, you write whole articles trying to tell me that what he said isnt actually what he said? Why not embed the video?</p>
<p>Obvious Propaganda is obvious.</p>
