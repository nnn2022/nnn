    <strong>Letter to MP re vaccine passports</strong>
    <p><p>I just thought I'd share an email I sent to my MP regarding the vaccine passport issue. There's a  debate scheduled in Parliament next Monday and this feels like a really important point in this entire charade to me. </p>
<p>&rt; Dear XXXX</p>
<p>&rt; With the parliamentary debate about so-called vaccine passports coming next week, I feel compelled to air my extreme concern about the situation that is developing our once great nation.</p>
<p>&rt;First - I will not be taking this vaccine. It has not undergone sufficient development for me to feel comfortable that there are no risks of long-term side-effects. I am at extremely minimal risk from the disease, it would be, by my estimation, an absurd and unnecessary risk to take an unnecessary vaccine. I will never take it. I know many people who feel the same way.</p>
<p>&rt;It should be apparent that a vaccine protects the person who takes the vaccine...thus, once anyone who wants the shot has gotten it, why should any restrictions be placed on society moving forward? If I have decided not to take the vaccine, I certainly do not want or expect the government to protect me from myself. There is a failure of logic here, and a breach of fundamental human liberty at play. It is not the government's job to compel or coerce people to take an experimental treatment for a trivial disease that they have no desire whatsoever of taking.</p>
<p>&rt;But more importantly, my concern is that a vaccine passport would create a divide in the country and the attitude of its people that are manifestly dangerous. We have a society of people where the government has scared half of them witless by overplaying the severity of covid, and they continue to believe the propaganda. These people are in a dangerous place - they have come to view their fellow countrymen as plague rats, not as fellow human beings. This is the kind of divided, us versus them thinking that can and has led to many great horrors in the past. At the risk of being somewhat cliche - I'm sure I need not inform you of what atrocities two-tiered societies have led to in the not so distant past, and I sense in Britain that kind of troubled society is brewing. If we allow any kind of two-tier society to manifest, it could take people to very dark places indeed, very quickly.  This is already not the Great Britain that I thought it was, and turning the thoughts of its peoples around rests on parliament.</p>
<p>&rt;I believe this is a watershed moment for the government. It is, in my opinion, of vital importance that any and all attempts at segregation be rejected outright in Great Britain if we are to have any claims left to being a free country. Parliament in general needs to start having more faith in the British public - it does not need to propagandise or send fear into the hearts of the people; it needs to send out a message of Unity, and that we are through the worst of it and rebuilding. Above all, that message must not be allowed to falter, particularly when cases inevitably climb back up next winter. Vaccine passports would serve to undermine that process, would undermine our businesses and economies even further, would harbour division and could easily bring about unprecedented violence.</p>
<p>&rt;I urge you to do what is obviously the right thing on this issue.</p>
<p>&rt;Yours sincerely</p>
<p>I would encourage all my fellow brits on this sub to write to their MPs with their thoughts, since this genuinely feels like the last chance for a return to true normalcy to me. You can find your MP's contact address at: https://www.writetothem.com/</p></p>
