    <strong>What was the first thing that made you think something isn't quite right?</strong>
    <p><p>Because initially, I was totally prepared to lockdown and do whatever. Based on "this is a new disease and people are dying"</p>
<p>My first impression was the low mortality rate compared to infection. Whereby it seemed silly to lock down everything, as opposed to finding out why a small percentage of the population were dying. And following identifying the physical difference/s, focus resources on protecting these specific people. Basically; lockdown started to feel like a very heavy handed approach, driven by fear more than anything else</p></p>

        <p>I was immediately suspicious because the lockdown was the most severe attack on civil liberties in living memory, worse than the laws imposed during World War 2. </p>
<p>The more I read about the virus, the more sure I was that it was no different than the flu. And then the UK government started granting itself the right to lock down and ban travel indefinitely, and passed laws that have nothing to do with the virus at all - relaxing urban planning laws, abolishing judicial review of legislation, extending police powers... real bad stuff.</p>

        <p>I looked up numbers for UK. They wouldn't build a proper hospital because it's too expensive. I believe a 120-bed hospital is of the order of $150mil. Instead, to save lives, lock down from April 2020 to April 2021 cost well over $300 billion.</p>
<p>When hospitals are too expensive, but lockdown saves lives... Future generations are not going to be pleased with the math or thinking behind that.</p>

        <p>That’s interesting.  That didn’t mean anything to me because I watched this very closely in the beginning and it was clear China was LYING like crazy.  Couldn’t trust anything coming from China.  About all you could conclude from China is that whatever they said was certainly not true.</p>

        <p>What bothered me from the very beginning were the inflated deaths, in comparison to the infections. After reading many articles on those numbers, especially ones that counted non-covid deaths as the same as ordinary deaths of another kind, nothing still matched up, and no one was still willing to explain the inconsistencies. Everytime that I asked for an explanation, the usual routine felt like this in a nutshell: Dismiss such inquires as the equivalent of, "a conspiracy theory". It was always because of this core reason, that's why I've always felt as though the real explanations for these inconsistencies, were being deliberately concealed from the public. Someone was indeed, "benefiting", from such a coverup.</p>
<p>This was always my motivation since the beginning: If this much effort is being used to bury any efforts at finding out the truth, then something, "big", must be going on. I was proven right as time went on, when reports began to surface that many death investigations were being corrupted with inflated numbers, in order to make the number of covid deaths appear much, "scarier", than they actually were. This same gut feeling, continues to be justified to this day, as more reports of inflated covid death numbers, continue to prove how far this same corruption has impacted our scientific understanding of covid.</p>

        <p>Severe lokdowns with the Police everywhere (an extreme overreaction) and our government building fake covid hospitals that fell apart within days. Insisting on expensive, risky vaccines while cheap and safe Ivermectin has been around for so long and all the effort put into censoring cemented my conclusion.</p>
<p>Also, someone I know who used to work for our government told me that public addresses about disastrous events (pandemics, natural disasters etc.) Are usually handled in a completely opposite way - the officials should show no fear, calm the citizens down and give constructive advice. That was the case during the variola vera outbreak and old people still remember it over here. Amidst all the drama he created, our president literally said that "all of our graveyards will be filled with dead bodies soon" which is an insane thing to do and goes contrary to protocols for situations like this.</p>

        <p>It was an information about how one of our national tv-stations had removed an interview with a certain doctor from their own website.</p>
<p>This made me want to hear that interview I previously wouldn't have cared about.</p>
<p>After proactively looking up that doctor and listening to what he had to say and then contextualizing this with him being removed, that was when I realized that something wasn't quite right.</p>
<p>Silencing/censoring other opinions really doesn't sit well with me! And this aspect has gotten so much worse ever since!</p>
<p>This happened around March 20th of last year. (I think interview was on 20th, removal on 21st and me learning about that on 24th)</p>

        <p>I promised myself if after six months of this  "pandemic" if the world was not significantly different, ie tons of people dead, that I would reevaluate. And boy is something up because the response we had does not match the data. At first I thought the lockdown was appropriate too, but no longer. The powers that be have taken science and dragged it's authority through the mud. We are in strange times now.</p>

        <p>It didn't feel right from the beggining, for a lot of reasons, but when this happened I started becoming more suspicious about the whole situation:</p>
<p>Back to march 2020. We were in the middle of lockdown and the government was saying that the lockdown would only last until covid cases decreased. One day I went out to buy some groceries and I realized that at every crosswalk there was a sign that said "Please keep your distance". It was painted with permanent paint, the same paint that is used for the ground road signs. That's when I realized that "the situation" wasn't going to last just a few weeks. Nowadays, a year and a half later, the crosswalk covid signs are still there. </p>
<p>Sorry about my English, but I wanted to share this experience.</p>

<p>The flu numbers were NON-Existent. I have maintained since Feb 2020 that Covid is just a Flu variant (I know it’s different)</p>
<p>Personally, never got a single flu shot and my body has been successful. I will trust 6,000+ years of evolutionary biology before an “Emergency Use Only” jab that you have to sign a full waiver for ….</p>

        <p>The initial responses seemed correct - and still do in hindsight, particularly given the intel at the time, and particularly watching it devastate italy.  The amount of first responders who died was not good at all - what are we going to do if the virus kills all the doctors and nurses.  </p>
<p>The disinformation about the virus origins was so maddeningly obvious by March, but overall the responses to the virus still seemed reasonable.  Chalked up the origin nonsense mostly to our toxic political climate - although science, the CDC, and the WHO seriously tanked their credibility over this issue. </p>
<p>Anyway, the data and news continued to be noisy for a while, but even so within a few months it started to appear likely that some of the measures were safety theatre.  Masks outdoors, for instance, was clearly dumb by summer 2020.  </p>
<p>But overall there were still many unknowns and noisy data, so most of the measures seemed reasonable enough, such as wearing masks while shopping.  At a minimum, there was enough uncertainty and understandable fear that I was willing to wear a pointless cloth mask to put others at ease at Quick Trip.  But I’m in Georgia so we didn’t lock down as hard or as long as other places, so my life was basically back to normal by summer 2020 anyway.  Some of the school lockdowns seemed ridiculous in the fall because it was abundantly clear this wasn’t affecting kids, but some amount was tolerable because it affected teachers.  But by January 2021 I started getting very skeptical as the disingenuous speech from news and government and narratives that contradicted my observations became too unbearable to ignore, although it was amusing watching the left lose their mind over trump and watching trump make a fool of himself when talking about and dealing with covid.  His off script speech about light and bleach is pure comedy gold.  What a manipulative con man. </p>
<p>And as the vaccine efforts have become increasingly bossy and belligerent, I’ve paid closer attention and have become appalled by the manipulation and propaganda, and particularly by how transparent but effective it is.</p>
