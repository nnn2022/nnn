    <strong>I feel a sense of bitterness (?) and annoyance towards uni students within these current times</strong>
    <p><p>I didn't know where to post this tbh. But I felt this place is the most relevant to this situation maybe? I'm not sure... </p>
<p>I fucking hate what this pandemic has done to education, I think mainly uni students have been exploited to the max by having profs that absolutely do not give a shit, raising tuition prices and doing your lectures online. It's an absolute shit show. HOWEVER what I find to be the worst part is <strong>cheating</strong>. </p>
<p>Students just get on discord, share the exam and just copy off of each other. Just so fucking simple. There's no hard work, there's no sense of accomplishment, there's no rage for having a difficult exam, nothing. You just get on the fucking discord and you have a chat with your little buddies and you do your exam and then you get your degree... It's fucked up. It's unfair. These COVID graduates are gonna be dumb as fuck with a fucking diploma that absolutely was not earned. </p>
<p>This world has gotten so fucked up and disgusting, I want to go to Mars. I was gonna go do my masters this year (2020-2021) but because of this disgusting shit I decided to postpone, in fact I'm so disgusted I don't even know if I want to continue my studies when it goes back to in person... I'm so fed up with humanity. There are no morals, no feelings, nothing. Just a bunch of idiots running around thinking they're kings.</p></p>

        <p>I'm first year student. It's absolute shit show, lecturers are not helpful at all and I had no practical work whatsoever just simulations (studying ecology). Agree cheating is easy af lol, but I must say, because of lockdowns and absolute 0 support from uni there's no way I could do it. My mental health and my ability to study at home as well as productivity  is at lowest point I ever had in my life. Therefore, I am happy I can cheat to get through, I'm still studying as much as I can, but the conditions we're given to get a degree is not normal. Just the whole idea that they allowed to close down educational sectors for people who are barely at risk is beyond me. The price for the course is still the same, yet all we get- presentation of slides, and they just read them aloud- that's it. I'm frustrated and just hopeful that 2nd y we will be allowed back to campus so I could actually give my best to do it,  but with current conditions I simply cannot..</p>

        <p>Schools have gone to shit forsure. I figured that a lot of college kids would be doing worse cuz they hardly bother to show up to class in normal times, so they def wouldn’t watch the lectures now. But didn’t factor in cheating. And the school admin won’t care, they’re just going through the motions</p>

        <p>Students' stay in university is relatively short-lived and so the common mentality is to act in the way that benefits their career ambitions regardless of the intrinsic worth of such behaviour.  Knowledge itself is sacrificed in favour of maximizing exam-writing capability, which is its own art, while the various clubs and organizations serve as title fodder for resumes whilst the organizations themselves, in so many cases, accomplish absolutely nothing.  A lot of students enter and even remain in university quite ignorant of how badly they are being cash-cowed, but by the time experience informs them and they come to fully grasp the situation, they graduate and thus retain no personal justification for reforming the problem.  Some don't even seem to mind.  Meanwhile, a new flock of students flows into the halls and the process repeats itself.  </p>
<p>I applaud students like you and the professors who, despite sharing your mentality and witnessing this problem play out on a daily basis over the course of their careers, still continue to teach unabashed and inspire who they can.  I would recommend focusing on self-discovery because knowledge of self will always guide you in the right direction in life.  Hold in there.</p>

<p>Students who are not afraid of the DeAdLy PaNdEmIc are more than welcome to come to my house and can crash on my couches if they want to pull an all-nighter. I have also doubled the number of hours that I am available for the PhD students (+50% for the MSc students) because I totally understand that it's difficult to learn on Teams and most are extremely demotivated. I really put effort into my students and go far beyond what is expected of me. I will not acquiesce to the NN and produce students who are incompetent. I also get a rise out of being extremely non-PC.</p>
<p>If you have multiple choice questions, just ensure that the questions AND answers cycle on everyone's exam.</p>
<p>If (like me) you prefer people to write on paper and scan their answers whilst being proctored,  you give them just enough time for them to finish.</p>

        <p>Who cares if they cheat?  They're not learning anything of value in adult daycare anyway, they just need their expensive piece of paper to not have their job application immediately trashed by some HR Karen.</p>
<p>All a degree proves is that someone is capable of showing up at the same building every day for 4 years, and sadly that's a rare trait these days.</p>
