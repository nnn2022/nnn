        <p>Low and stable inflation is good. Targets of 2% are the norm for CBs all over. I'll be worried about it if they can't/won't get it stable and under control at 3% or less in a year.</p>

        <p>WHY is 2% inflation good? Are you satisfied with having prices double every 35 years? You also need to look at HOW inflation rates are calculated. For example, inflation in the US excludes housing and education costs and the calculation was changed in the 70s, 80s and 90s. If they used the 1980s method, inflation in the us would be 14% p.a. "Stable prices" don't mean 2% inflation - they means ZERO percent inflation.</p>

        <p>I said nothing about stable prices, I said stable and low inflation.</p>
<p>You don't need to 'teach' me about inflation. I think you might want to look at how inflation is calculated because you're acting like there's only one price index, and like consumption patterns have been stable since 1970.</p>
