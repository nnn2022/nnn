        <p>Being a critical thinker is a complete threat to the agenda. If people start honestly asking questions this whole thing falls apart.</p>

        <p>They don't teach it in school. Maybe 1 in a 100 people have it. But all progress in life is the result of it. What is it? Skepticism. That's critical thinking. That's the red pill. Skepticism. The ability to listen to an expert and say "bullshit, that doesn't make any sense. I don't care if you have an M and a D after your name."</p>

        <p>This is why I was constantly catching shit back when I was in elementary and high school (and even university). I was <em>always</em> calling teachers out on things. Asking "uncomfortable" questions. And when the answers I got made no sense, and I said they made no sense, I got told to "stop being disruptive" or what have you.  </p>
<p>Naturally, as a result, I got pretty tired of that rigmarole, so I pretty much became one of those "bad" kids. Always causing trouble, coming up with random scams, figuring out ways to cheat, do as little work as possible, etc. I was one of, if not <em>the</em> smartest kid in my school(s), and at least a couple of teachers realized this, and thinking back on it, they did their best to try and cultivate what they saw in me. I did get <em>some</em> attention in that regard, but by that point, I was already well into high school, and thoroughly set in my anti-authoritarian ways.  </p>
<p>Overall, I'm glad for it. Went into business for myself because I absolutely cannot stand anyone lording authority over me. I've hated the government since before I could even vote, on general principles. All of these bullshit government "public health" edicts have only driven my hate up past eleven. I was...relatively content to simply co-exist with them. Navigate my way through their system, cutting corners and flouting their "laws" when it was convenient, in situations where I was generally 99\~% (because nothing is ever quite 100%) sure I'd be able to get away with it. But now that they've overstepped like this...hmm. Well, I just don't know!</p>

        <p>Same here almost perfectly, only difference is I would never call myself the bad kid or whatever. I just did my thing, and paid no attention to nonsense. When you have natural rational reaction to everything in life, it just sort of goes that direction.</p>
<p>I created my own market, and for the last decade, all it has done is grow. It's all just recognizing what's real, and being real as a result. Don't bullshit people, and nobody has any reason to question your word.</p>
<p>The Doomers are the first types to kneejerk on bullshit, especially if it involves any sort of business activity, but when it comes to government, it can never be wrong, because the government "answers to the people"....  Newsflash, the government is the biggest corporation around, and they make all the rules. If you think your vote counts towards anything, good luck. Votes are a way to placate the masses and think they have any voice in the matter.</p>

        <p>Not gonna lie. I kinda liked being the bad kid. Big agree on the government though. Like I said, I was tolerant of them. Willing to co-exist. I found what you might call a "happy medium" in that regard, and it was working just fine. But then they had to go and fuck it up with this horse shit. Now I'm left deciding whether I should just pack up and move my whole family somewhere else, or hunker down for what is looking to be more and more like an inevitable fight.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure what the future holds. Part of me thinks this is a huge test, and all sides are in on it. The other part of me feels like even the jackasses that overreacted to all this are feeling the pressure, and it never was as bad as anybody made it out to be, and it's CYA time, with some of the biggest offenders like my state (Inslee) holding out to the extent.</p>
<p>All I know, is this last year, year and a half, has changed me fundamentally. I used to tolerate unnecessary government, and individuals pushing government because it was just part of the process, and people are morons. Going forward, none of it matters anymore. I will live how I want to, and nothing will stop that.</p>

<p>Exactly why I've never voted. When you don't have a vested interest it's a lot easier to see both sides playing us.</p>

        <p>I don't generally like to get into specifics about it online since I keep my online antics and my real life self pretty segregated. I'll just say it involves heavy equipment and warehouse space. I'm also a landlord. Which I'm not too worried about letting slip, since there are literally hundreds if not thousands of landlords where I live, so that's not doxxing fodder in the slightest.  </p>
<p>It's good business, at any rate. Busy almost all year round. And generally recession proof, or at least highly resistant. Being self-employed ain't for everyone though. Takes a lot of discipline and ambition to see success.</p>

        <p>The sad thing about schools is that it's all about indoctrination. You get kids at a young age and you mold them into obedient workers and to not question authority. That's how people subconsciously give their power away, because it is manufactured consent.</p>

        <p>Not true. I assure you I know more about vaccine injury than 99% of doctors out there. Why? I've studied the subject for &rt; 1000 hours (read 19 books) and most doctors haven't studied it for 30 minutes. You've been taken in by the expert fallacy. Trust the experts.

        <p>Can you not fucking read? I said I know more than most doctors about vaccine injury. Ask any MD if they know who Dr William Thompson is. I assure you 99% never heard of him. I'll keep you from having to Google it. He's a whistleblower who worked at the CDC who pointed out the MMR vaccines are dangerous to certain populations. How many MDs do you think know there's someone who worked at the CDC that said vaccines can harm? I'm guessing less than 1%. Looking forward to your next incorrect assumption.</p>

        <p>argumentum ad verecundiam, you have the definition right but applied wrongly, amazing how you got the latin term correct. google i supposed, but you're supposed to read beyond just the description.</p>
<p>appeal to authority, or argument from authority is a fallacy ONLY in cases where you see lewis hamliton or tiger woods advocating for the gillette shaver. they're figures of authority in their respective field but they're NOT the specialist in the area. that's where your argumentum ab auctoritate comes in. But if they're making a statement about cars or golf club though, that DOESN'T constitute to appeal to authority. </p>
<p>meaning a dentist recommending a certain toothbrush brand or toothpaste is legitimate. meaning an MD's word would carry a lot more weight in the medical field. covid included. </p>
<p>facts are portrayed by the author and the person reviewing the literature. so come now, what facts would you like discuss ? btw, you've requested for one link, i pasted it, and then you got stumped or something ?</p>

        <p>you really need to read up. here, let me help;  </p>
<p>Be very careful not to confuse "deferring to an authority on the issue" with the appeal to authority fallacy. Remember, a fallacy is an error in reasoning. Dismissing the council of legitimate experts and authorities turns good skepticism into denialism. The appeal to authority is a fallacy in argumentation, but deferring to an authority is a reliable heuristic that we all use virtually every day.   </p>
<p>There is always a chance that any authority can be wrong, that’s why the critical thinker accepts facts provisionally. It is not at all unreasonable (or an error in reasoning) to accept information as provisionally true by credible authorities. Of course, the reasonableness is moderated by the claim being made (i.e., how extraordinary, how important) and the authority (how credible, how relevant to the claim).</p>

<p>so here you go, unless you've a legitimate reason to doubt the MD, you're going into denialism. again, i'm not accepting things SIMPLY because he/she is an MD, he/she is an MD and therefore is more credible.</p>

        <p>Justifying an alternative stance on a subject based on "bullshit, that doesn't make any sense." is engaging in a fallacy. It's called the argument from ignorance (or the argument from personal incredulity). It is not critical thinking. It is not skepticism. </p>
<p>Just because it doesn't make sense to you, doesn't mean it's incorrect. It may be that you do not have the information, or requisite education in a particular field, to understand the explanation at hand.</p>
<p>If you can honestly say that your education in a matter is sufficient to make a declarative statement like that, then you have never been educated in anything.</p>
<p>Anyone with at least a significant level of study, training and expertise in single subjects question their knowledge of the subject all the time. They would never make such conclusive statements as that. </p>
<p>It's the Dunning-Kruger effect and you're statement smacks of it.</p>

<p>I agree. But it does me I should question it and look into it further. True skepticism leads to further inquiry, but that takes effort, which most people don't care to do.</p>

        <p>Agreed. And those with an inquisitive mind will find that any answer they receive will usually prompt twice as many questions. To adopt a mantra of “bullshit, that doesn’t make any sense, therefore x” is saying that you’ve stopped inquiring because you won’t accept an answer you’ve found, because it doesn’t make sense. You need to spring off this point and ask why doesn’t it make sense.</p>

        <p>I think most people <em>want</em> to call themselves critical thinkers and genuinely start asking these questions. The breakdown comes when they find out they have to do <em>work</em> to find the answers. People are lazy and would rather just make the wrong decision than put in a little effort to figure out what the right decision is.</p>

<p>I wish it were that simple.</p>
<p>The media is just propaganda now.  It stopped being a valid business long ago.  If it were, we would see competing narratives because that's what business is all about.  Imagine if one station broke the "crimes against humanity" story and told the truth.  Everyone would watch that station based on sensationalism alone, and advertisers would pay big bucks for all those eyeballs.  That's not how it works anymore.  Now they just read the script the so-called Illuminati gives them. </p>
<p>It's pretty pathetic, but it will all be over soon.  Within five years we will be in a whole new free, prosperous, natural world.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, it's not "Work" to critical thinkers, it's natural. There is a base to form an opinion from, and it's self-evident to prove the case. If you're wrong, you're wrong, there is literally no risk. The people who don't think critically already second hand their opinions to others, it's part of their nature.</p>

        <p>There's people on both sides asking themselves these questions and people on both sides just following the trend/party policies and if you want to pretend otherwise, you're just lying to yourself.</p>
<p>But all sources are not equal. My main sources of information are "The Lancet", a journal of medicine, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI. Both these resources are intended for professionals and as such are accurate and objective. </p>
<p>That being said, I often see "critical thinkers" using sources with obvious bias and treating them like it contained "The Truth". I don't think such person can or should objectively call themselves critical thinkers. </p>
<p>If the sources you're using are openly pro-vaxx or anti-vaxx, then you're not doing objective research, you're being manipulated by someone with an agenda.</p>
<p>Here's the link to the two resources I mentioned using;</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ </p>
<p>https://www.thelancet.com/</p>
<p>And here two more I use from times to times.</p>

        <p>Actually it's not much different, sars is the worse strain with a 15% mortality rate, it that one were the one upon us, we would be in a real pandemic. I would link the study but I cant link a pdf. If you Google it I'm sure you would find it.</p>

        <p>Don't you guys like comparing vaccines and Thalidomid (Contergan)?</p>
<p>Thalidomid has two forms. The difference is that one single bond between two atoms in the molecule stands in a different angle. The one form works as sleeping pill. The other form makes fetuses disabled. </p>
<p>Tiny differences can have huge impacts. That's why every new drug is tested for quality, efficacy and safety.</p>

<p>we could just go back to normal now and let the chips fall where they land, your fallacy is this idea that the shot is a requirement to "return to normal", you know how you "return to normal"? you remove the dictators from the government that are actively violating your rights and then vote in people that believe in the Constitution and bam life goes back to normal. Will some people die of a virus, sure, but whats different about that, people die from the common cold and we don't shut the world down every flu season, MILLIONS more people are being born every year then die from Covid, those deaths would be but a blip in the charts in the grand scheme of the planet.</p>

If we can save lives by doing all of this stuff then we should. And we dont shut down over the flu bcs I dont know, WE HAVE A VACCINE.

        <p>I have a whole family of uncles and aunts who were all critical thinkers, but somehow lost the edge now with covid. My brother, who wasn't so sharp on things, has now woken up, as is my niece. The young generation is leading the fight in my case. We have a clear age-divide in our house as well, the other way.</p>

        <p>I approve of critical thinking but also "fighting diseases" is so nebulous. I just need to point out that there are diseases that have been eliminated, smallpox for one. But other things like cancer cannot be eliminated because they occur naturally when cell splitting is flawed.</p>

        <p>I'm kind of in the middle. I want to move on with my life and am willing to accept any potential risks. So far, I have been fortunate and have not any adverse affects. I know it is unwise to trust something that was rushed like this, but I half-joked when I told some of my friends "I don't care if I grow a new limb or develop scales- If it means dropping this mask and social distance insanity, I'll take it." Of course, politicians and so-called "experts" still think you need to wear a mask even after getting a vaccine and I call b.s. on that. I'm not playing this game anymore. I will NOT wear a mask anymore!</p>
<p>I understand that not everyone is comfortable with getting a vaccine and that is okay. I respect people that don't want the vaccine and have a healthy skepticism about it. I blame the government and media for creating this environment because a lot them were the ones that said "Don't take the vaccine" when Trump was still in office, but pulled a 180 as soon as Biden took over. Screw them.</p>

        <p>Damn dude what you described in the first paragraph is the definition of coercion: "To bring about by pressure, threat, or force." And then the goalposts being moved as well. In my mind that approach is not conducive to getting anyone to take an experimental vaccine, yet they double down by threatening to implement vaccine passports.</p>
<p>I agree with your philosophy though and it seems like you got a good head on ya.</p>

        <p>The only way I'll take it is if my job is threatened (and I can't find a loophole) or if shock-troops give me a choice between getting killed, going to jail for a long time, or taking the jab.</p>
<p>What if taking the jab, prevents our bodies from mounting a natural immunity to new variants (if we contract them). As a result, anyone who gets the shot now will necessarily have to get the "booster" shots. Just a speculation, but it seems that the vax might impede forming natural immunity.</p>

        <p>People need to see each other’s faces to interact the most effectively. Seeing someone’s smile and facial expressions is important for mental health. What I am saying is not disputable. Endless research has been done on how much quick information our minds form by seeing face and their full range of expressions. I’m sure you’ve said a few hundred times on Reddit in the last year, “follow the science!”. Well, go ahead and do that. </p>
<p>What’s frustrating about the mask mandates is that they seemingly are endless. Millions upon millions are vaccinated and the mandates still exist. Why? Tossing the masks was supposed to be a carrot for getting vaccinated. Transmission and getting sick after being vaccinated is possible, but extraordinarily low. People used to die from the flu until Covid killed all of it. So what happens when the flu comes back? If even a single person can die from the flu do we mandate mask wearing all over again? That’s why people push back on this shit. You do not give gov’t power and expect them to willingly relinquish it. </p>
<p>Covid should have been a wake up call for everyone. It was but not in a good way. I took this time to become the healthiest I’ve been in my life. I eat much better, exercise more often and take vitamin D and zinc, along with elderberry everyday. I haven’t been sick in a year and a half. Not even a sniffle. I assume there are many others like me but clearly it is not the majority of people.</p>

        <p>I guess 🤷‍♂️. I wear a mask when I have to and don’t when I don’t have to. I’m not scared of Covid either or it’s minuscule long term effects. With my age and good health, I’m unlikely to even get it, let alone have it effect me in any significant way. And if it does it does.</p>

        <p>You are blindly following a movement that gets 0 of their information from science but rather misinformation and blatant lies from idiots that have no scientific background. Scientific evidence is not propaganda. Right wing news outlets making shit up to cause outrage and panic among idiots that don’t believe science is propaganda. You are literally doing anything you are told by people that have no background in what they’re telling you what to do. You eat propaganda for breakfast lunch and dinner. You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about and it’s insane that people as dumb as you actually exist</p>
<p>If you can show or read emotion with a mask over the mouth, you are incapable of reading emotion to begin with so I don’t think that’s something you need to worry about.</p>

        <p>That doesn't look very lit. It seems full of garbage experiments designed to get the wanted outcome (laser light-scattering to detect droplet emission while speaking - where they only look at the front of the mask and ignore emissions to the side - etc.) Like I said: IGNORE ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE ACTUAL INFECTED PEOPLE.</p>

        <p>So you see right through the flaw in this study which compiles literally every piece of information available as of the date of publishing? That seems irrational at best. At any rate you're entitled to your opinion but you're not entitled to present it as fact...  Also not sure whom I'm shilling for?</p>

        <p>Not reducing size of client pool. Just making client pool wear masks. We just have to prolong the masked normal that we all hate.  I HATE masks (see username), but if society is going to have a huge % of people not taking the alternate option, masking might have to continue.</p>
<p>I don’t want people catching COVID in my business. I also don’t want them getting so drunk at my bar that they go kill someone else (even though it’s less than 1% of population that get killed by drunk drivers). Some bar owners can live with it to make a couple extra bucks, whether it should be legal, I’m unsure.</p>

        <p>Getting sued hurts businesses, too. For that matter, it's a matter of when and not if most healthcare providers require their employees to get the vaccine. School district will probably require it, elder care facilities will probably require it, and I'm sure you have no issue with a private company requiring its employees to get a vaccine. After all, if you don't want to get it, you don't have to work there.</p>

        <p>The thing that is swaying me is this : will I be able to attend public gatherings ie: sports/concerts and obv travel. I’m not ok with me being restricted from these things. It’s unfair, but if it has to be done then maybe I’ll get the “shot”. I’m sure many MANY ppl are saying this...I just don’t know what to do. We live one life. If my son wants to go to a baseball game and I say we can’t, I’ll be crushed. Please don’t ridicule me, I’m trying to give him a life of what he loves. 😔</p>

        <p>We need more people to not buckle no matter the initial threat of restrictions. If the vaccine works there is absolutely no reason to require 100% compliance. If the government continues to push that everyone has to get it then I think it's worth questioning what their motives are.</p>

        <p>I’ve gotten the vaccination and I can tell you that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. I tend to have semi-severe reactions to any vaccine and this time was actually better than most. It’s definitely worth it to be able to go see your family and do things we want to do. I know it sucks to give in to “herd thinking” but just try to think of it as doing it for you, not because someone told you to do it, but because you personally chose to get the vaccine. Hope I could help</p>

        <p>The thing I’m worried about though is the potential for long term side effects (is it possible 1 year or 10 year down the line there will be some illness in my body due to something in the vaccine?). I read off a Reddit post that vaccines have never given any long term effects and usually present side effects within the first 3 months and afterwards if no side effects are shown then it should be smooth sailing, though I haven’t fully researched to see the validity of this claim.</p>

        <p>I’ve heard the same thing about vaccine side effects typically showing up fairly soon (including from a doctor I trust).  But my 2 big questions on the long term effects.  1) mRNA vaccines haven’t been used widely in humans before, so it is possible that the prevalence of long term effects in standard vaccines is not applicable 2) What if this vaccine causes damage that is immediate but not immediately noticeable.  For example, what if a covid vaccine causes some damage to the reproductive system on Day 1 but isn’t noticeable (or appears to be mild) until trying to have a child?  It might be a long time before the side effect is noticed on an individual level or on a wider scale.  All of the “fact checks” and government PR says something along the lines of “there is no data that indicates fertility issues with the vaccine”.  Well, how would we know?  Seems like someone who’s gotten a vaccine already and is immediately trying to have a child is still in the time range in which it isn’t overly alarming that they haven’t been able to get pregnant, so if this vaccine causes fertility issues (not saying it does, just an example) that red flag wouldn’t have shown up yet necessarily.</p>

        <p>One more question added to the left side is "if I Had Covid Already, why do I need an "emergency" injection vaccine". </p>
<p>Getting the virus and recovering from it is akin tio natural vaccination for every other virus.   When people ask me if I am vaccincated, I tell them it is NONE of their f***ing business, but if pushed I proudly answer YES,   I had Covid, and I am vaccinated the natural way!</p>

        <p>Btw I was reading so me of your past posts on banking, I think I agree with almost everything you say around banking and money.  I'm just not clear how it went so off the rails.  I feel like the growth economics model is fundamentally flawed, and that it promotes exploitation and unsustainable practices.  Isn't a more controlled socialist approach the way to manage those things?  You seem like you are anti-socialist, but I may have misinterpreted that.</p>

        <p>First I would like you to answer the questions in this post about the big pharma "vax".  That is how it went off the rails because nobody has the right to force me to do anything and I do not have the right to force anyone to either.  If you can respect that then we will get along just fine.  If you can't answer the questions then you have no standing to coerce people into doing what you want.</p>
<p>Second, I am an Anarchist in the truest sense of the word.  No masters, No slaves.  That doesn't mean without rules, it just means without rulers.  It doesn't mean people can just violate others Natural Rights either.</p>
<p>You can't come over here or have g0v goons come and shut off anything of mine because I wont conform to you or anybodies worldview or belief. </p>
<p>I have no Right to do that to you and you to me no matter what you think or believe.</p>
<p>If you want to wear ten masks and get pumped full of poison I have no right to stop you.</p>
<p>Having a central bank is a plank in The Communist Manifesto therefore this is not free market capitalism no matter what anyone says.  What we have is a Fabian socialist economy masquerading as capitalism at best.  This creates artificial scarcity at the benefit of the globalist monopoly men at the top.</p>
<p>The only way to true egalitarianism is through anarchy and anarco-capitalism which will create such abundance that material "money" will become obsolete.</p>

        <p>We can talk about the vaccines, but maybe it's better to start with a question.  Where does the vaccine science break down for you?  I agree that the covid vaccines have not been fully tested, that's not in dispute as far as I can tell.  But are you fundamentally against all vaccinations or just covid?  There is about 100 years worth of research and evidence that different vaccines work, do you believe it's all fraudulent?</p>

        <p>I will never take any "vax" or anything else from big pharma which has a wake of death and destruction throughout their history.  I could care less what the FDA approves they are a criminal organization as well and also have a wake of death and destruction behind them.</p>
<p>I am pro-health and will allow my own immune system to do its job.  Humans can NOT improve upon the design of the Grand Architect of this Universe.  i don't put unknown substances inside my temple no matter what the "cause" is.</p>
<p>I know full well what is being perpetuated upon humanity and I will never give my consent to join this order following satanic cult of mask wearing and poison injections.</p>
<p>They don't hand out paper thin masks to military personal when they have to go into a chemical/biological/nuclear danger zone.  They don full on tactical gas/bio masks with high grade filters that seal all the way around your face and/or Hazmat type suits so don't try and give me this crap that the paper mask is to protect other people.  Let's get serious here and start thinking for ourselves.</p>
<p>There is also vax shedding which is a whole other topic itself that is causing harm to the unvaccinated.  I don't consent to it so I don't want to be around the vaccinated.  Vax shedding is a clear violation of my Natural Rights so i will avoid those people.</p>
<p>Here is just some of the research that i have done pertaining to this situation.  If this doesn't make you stop and think for a second I really don't know what will.</p>

        <p>Your right, cuz all the scientific peer reviewed papers I cited and the true FACTS that big pharma and the FDA have an undisputed wake of death and destruction are "issues with scientific principles".</p>
<p>Smh, ROTFLMAO, it seems to me that your brain has been affected by the "vacc1n3" in a "fundamentally scientific" way.</p>
<p>Still couldn't answer not one question in this post about the death shot...lol.</p>
<p>Good riddance to you and your family and when you experience complications from your little shot make sure you fervently deny it like the good little cult member that you are.</p>

        <p>Hey, I have been doing my best not to respond to the vitriol you are spewing.  To understand the validity of all the science behind vaccines takes a scientific education.  You clearly lack that, or for some reason reject that.   Not sure what you have against my family but that's fine too, to be frank your opinions and your points are so ridiculous that no one would ever listen to the nonsense you spout.  That's too bad because it sounds like you might actually know something when it comes to financial systems.   </p>
<p>Now like a rabid dogs who's been kicked too many times you are going to go off on a rant again.  </p>
<p>What I don't understand is why an angry, antisocial maniac like yourself bothers to join an online community?  </p>
<p>It's ironic that your paranoia about science and technology allows you to use a computer and wifi.</p>

        <p>I'm not here to be your friend or be nice to you when you talk sht and can't even answer any questions or prove any of the facts wrong.</p>
<p>Your rudimentary cult mind control techniques do not work on me.</p>
<p>Your only way out to to attempt to say I lack "fundamental scientific principals" yet you can't dispute any of the links I have provided because you are a clown.  </p>
<p>So I guess Dr. Frances Boyle who had a special Henry Kissinger PhD. from Harvard and all the other scientists that wrote those papers don't know what they are talking about and you do? STFU</p>
<p>You are a waste of time scientism cult clown.</p>
<p>Good riddance, I will not be replying again to your nonsense.</p>

        <p>Lol in my experience, your entire goal is to drag me down the rabbit hole of some nonsensical theory that you don't really understand but are ideologically attached to.  I'm not getting tangled up in your cleverly conceived (but ultimately wrong) arguments, because you lack understanding of the basic facts.  I admire your conviction and I think you might have something to teach me about economic theory.  However, your internet science education has left you lacking the fundamental tools required to participate in this discussion.  Instead you immediately devolve the entire discourse into "he who tells the loudest is correct".  I'm not going to validate your stupidity by engaging in a debate with your clearly warped world view.</p>
<p>Good day to you sir.</p>

        <p>For sure... You can and should be able to opt out.  Of course you should also be forced to opt out of all the other social benefits you enjoy. Clean water, electricity, property rights, access to health care and food.  Go it alone, that should be your right. </p>

        <p>But what about the people who died, my grandpa had a friend, whose wife fell down the stairs and had to go to the hospital, she got infected there, and died within 2 days. Then her husband got infected (supposedly for visiting her) and died within 3 days. In less than a week their sons and grandsons lost them. Don't you think that, the virus is something real, that has more chances to kill if not vaccinated or if you don't take care of going outside with all the protocols in mind.</p>

        <p>Im pretty sure a quick google search can answer all of those questions, as they have been asled previously by other people, and officials answered them. But we all know you arent looking for answers, you are looking for <em>those</em> answers that agree with you.</p>
<p>If you think a quick google search means nothing, then I suggest you go and get a degree in virology. Or you can believe the people who already have a degree in it.</p>
<p>Saying that all of them are liars and are doing for the money just confirms the question in the title.</p>
<p>By the way, you arent critical thinkers.</p>

        <p>In a world when any answer can be found I think it’s up to an individual to make a choice. And when Krispy Kream and McDonald’s are telling you to get the vaccine along with every corporation we have agreed is greedy and doesn’t really care; maybe you have some thinking to do.</p>

        <p>It’s weird that corporations and the media is the one pushing this. Fauci is the other one but has proved he lied about the masks to protect the healthcare workers over the masses. And gates who was begging you to get the vaccine just got found out that he has ties to Epstein. Why is everyone working so hard to convince people to get it. If the world was truly going through a pandemic it would be obvious; you wouldn’t need the media to keep reminding you and keeping you in fear.</p>

        <p>yes, vaccines that where tested and have long term safety records, not something that was rushed out in a few months.</p>
<p>you see, this is what you "just get the shot" bigots don't get, we aren't "anti-vaxxers" we are Anti-EXPERIMENTAL Vaxxers, because we've seen how that has gone in history, like oh say the Tuskegee Experiment for example.</p>
<p>You should really learn about the standard procedure and long term studies that have been required for every other vaccine to be approved for general use in the USA, this "Vaccine" simply doesn't have that data and can't have it for several years because you need TIME to pass to see how things play out and we haven't had that yet with this one.</p>

        <p>That isn’t how hospitals work though. Hospitals get paid by whatever services they provide, not by the cause of death of a person. My wife is a hospital administrator, so I’d like to believe this is a fact. Do you have any evidence to the contrary?</p>

<p>First one is talking about a funeral benefit paid to individual surviving family members from FEMA. That’s what FEMA does after a disaster and that’s not a secret. This doesn’t have anything to do with hospitals. </p>
<p>Is the problem with this part?:</p>
<p>&rt;    An official death certificate that attributes the death to COVID-19 and shows that the death occurred in the United States. The death certificate must indicate the death “may have been caused by” or “was likely the result of” COVID-19 or COVID-19-like symptoms. Similar phrases that indicate a high likelihood of COVID-19 are considered sufficient attribution.</p>
<p>Second link:</p>
<p>&rt;    Q: Are hospitals inflating the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more?
A: Recent legislation pays hospitals higher Medicare rates for COVID-19 patients and treatment, but there is <strong>no evidence of fraudulent reporting.</strong></p>

        <p>&rt;HOW THE GOD DAMN FUCK DO YOU EXPECT ME TO LINK EVIDENCE OF A FUCKING CRIME YOU STUPID FUCKING SHITHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>oh look, you do have an absolute lack of control over your emotions. how old are you, 5 ? LOL  </p>
<p>FIRST you claim that you've seen it somewhere, it was reported on the news etc. now you said it's a crime and there's no link or evidence to it ? do you really think reasoning like that would work ? i think you slept with a goat last night and penetrated it too ! i have no evidence of you doing so but i know you did. i can provide you nothing but i know people who's done it and you look like one. LOL.   </p>
<p>&rt;Also your "fact check" site is funded by George Soros and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, </p>
<p>sure, check other sources, or you know talk to actual clinicians themselves, doesn't mean that whatever doesn't fit your narrative isn't true. i'm pretty sure you had sex with a goat, that your mom can be your alibi means nothing to me because i know she'd lie to keep you safe. rubbish.  </p>
<p>how's <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tommybeer/2020/10/30/trump-baslessly-accuses-doctors-of-overreporting-covid-deaths-for-financial-gain/?sh=4b6b06417547">forbes</a> for news ? no ? <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/america-votes/trump-falsely-claims-doctors-are-inflating-coronavirus-death-counts-for-money-as-cases-again-hit-record-levels-1.5169172">ctv</a> ? <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/31/trump-claims-doctors-profiting-attributing-deaths-covid-19/6101540002/">usatoday</a> ?

<p>"The American College of Emergency Physicians released a statement that it was "appalled" by the president's claim."    </p>
<p><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/us-map">John Hopkins</a> ? how bout <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/10/25/such-insult-doctors-furious-trump-peddles-baseless-claim-they-are-inflating-covid">sites</a> that aren't funded ? or actual <a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/939785">medical</a> sites ?  </p>
<p>how does all those sources point to the same thing you conspiracy turd ?   </p>

<p>nope, i did not take part in the insurrection at all, those people there, THEY are the terroist, and if you support them, you're one too. careful now, FBIs are still on the lookout, LOLOL</p>
<p>&rt; election was stolen</p>
<p>any prove ? no ? sidney powell's fall from grace not enough for you ? even she claims that it's not true, and she's just "sharing an opinion" she's no evidence, nothing whatsoever to back her up. if it was truly stolen, then Trump and his legal team must be truly incompetent to LOSE ALL COURT CASES. oh wait, he'd actually won 1 out of the nearly 60 he lost. not like it made any difference.

        <p>Here's the thing. By this logick I'd be in the "critical thinker" category, and I actually did get the vaccine -- Moderna shot #1 was back in April and my second shot comes up in 2 weeks.</p>
<p>So far so good, kept a lookout for any of the potential side effects, nonesofar. </p>
<p>The problem is that you either get people who entirely believe everything about it at face value.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Some of the people who distrust all of it at face value</p>
<p>Plus nobody's gunna think someone's a conspiracy theorist SOLELY because they didn't get the vaccine (which lets be real no one would really know unless they asked you and you answered)</p>
<p>basically, this chart is a bit of a straw-man of people who got the vaccine and why they did so.</p>

<p>Why get vaccinated if you can still get sick. Why add more risk to your body. They are still conducting vaccine studies that won’t be completed till 2023. These pharmaceutical companies have been sued for false marketing and knowingly selling lethal products. Wake up. </p>

        <p>It's a stochastics problem. You reduce the probability of most people getting the virus, the rate of infection decreases.</p>
<p>The real question you should be asking is why do you think this is a conspiracy? Which seems more likely, big pharma, the government, the media, and scientists are all working together to destroy the economy for their own personal gain -- or these "critical thinkers" have their heads in the sand and imagining these questions are unanswerable despite the answers being freely available?  Obviously studies cannot have finished because literally there hasn't been enough time. </p>
<p>Big pharma wants money.... killing everyone is a good way to make money worthless. Considering they run shit, I think they'd realize the shortcomings of screwing this up.</p>
<p>Real critical thinkers ask who stands to gain.... not this conspiracy bullshit.</p>

<li>do they have legal liability - I don't actually know how to research this question</li>
<li>how long was it tested for - about 6 months which is faster than normal because the virus was screwing with everything</li>
<li>who is telling me to get it - FUCKING EVERYONE BECAUSE WE WANT TO GO BACK TO NORMAL</li>
<li>what is their track record - not sure</li>
<li>is it effective - yes, even if you get the virus you won't have a reaction more severe than a cold (apparently it is 100% effective kids)</li>
<li>how many side effects reported - fever, headache, chills, feels like you've got a knife in your arm for a bit (Johnson got shut down because it rarely caused seizures)</li>
<li>how many deaths reported - about 4,000 but that is in a very large sample size and there is  no statistical correlation between the vaccine and dying ie. they probably died of things other than the vaccine</li>

        <p>And what did Einstein say about capitalism? It leaves power in few private hands that will for all sense and purpose seize the methods of communication and politicians to perpetuate and maintain their power at the expense of the masses. They don’t care about your health this is about control. </p>
<p>Albert Einstein wrote in Why Socialism?</p>
<p>Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.</p>

        <p>So, several points here. First is that vaccines take a bit to build immunity. J&amp;J for example takes about a week and up to 2 for full effectiveness. 2nd is that vaccines are not 100% effective but the secondary result is that the illness is much less severe and shorter in duration. J&amp;J again is about 66% effective at preventing COVID but it is more than 95% effective at eliminating hospitalization. Even if your mortality rate is correct that is more dead Americans than WW2, Vietnam, Afghanistan and pretty much any other tragedy. Lastly, the mortality rate is not really the big concern. The main risk is collapsing the healthcare system. Just months ago cities were forced to turn away emergencies because hospitals were at capacity. People would literally get shot or have a heart attack and die in the parking lot because there are no beds. See India right now</p>

        <p>Hospitals weren’t at capacity. The boats at nyc didn’t get used. Lots of hospitals are actually closing. You’re assuming everyone is gonna get sick. This is not a big deal. Instead of telling people to be afraid and rely on a shortcut to health tell them to eat healthy food, exercise, meditate, get some sun,</p>

        <p>Again see India or Italy. Your points aren’t correct. It’s not just capacity it’s manpower and resources. The hospital ship wasn’t used because that was specifically sent for Non COVID/ Non emergency patients which meant that they all had to be quarantined before even being brought on board which ending up not mattering because they cancelled all elective procedures. Hospitals are closing because they need patients and procedures to make money. They need to perform surgeries and give exams etc. treating patients at a reduced capacity for extended periods is against their entire business model.</p>
<p>For your last point, all good advice but again for the love of god look at India or Italy. They don’t have anywhere near our obesity rate, they don’t have nearly the comordities and are generally healthier populations. The difference is their healthcare system was overrun and they did not have a successful vaccine rollout</p>

        <p>All those questions can be answered by going through published papers smh. These aren't some old hats in lab gowns and glasses coming up with solutions out of thin air. There's a huge trail of published, peer-reviewed research on the current vaccines and covid itself. </p>

<p>The same can be said for the disease itself. How do you know that a couple years from now we're not going to have a rash of student athletes having heart attacks at practice, and it's going to turn out that all of them had covid when they were kids?</p>

        <p>That is on-again off-again symptoms right?  It goes dormant.  When your immune system is down it can pop up and cause you problems.  It’s not random, and it certainly is not a constant impactful thing.</p>

        <p>And if chickenpox were a brand new virus we would have no idea that this was a thing for decades. Covid has potential to cause cardiovascular damage - that seems like the sort of thing that could potentially have consequences later in life. </p>
<p>I know you want to brush this off as "it's a coronavirus, we've had those before" but the fact is that's really fucking stupid way to go about it. We haven't really studied coronaviruses - we haven't had a need to until now.</p>

        <p>It is arbitrary. Do you know how often families of viruses get revised as scientists learn new information about where they come from? Just because two viruses have to be in the same family does not mean that you can predict the way that one is going to behave based on how the other does.</p>

        <p>All I really need to look into are the empirical and obvious facts.</p>
<p>IFR is 0.075% for my age group.  I’ve not taken nearly any precautions since right about a year ago.  In my circle of friends a scant few of them have even tested positive.  No serious impacts and certainly no deaths.  Bottom line, tons of opportunities to “catch” this highly contagious pathogen!</p>
<p>On the other side of the coin, a number of folks I know have had the vaccine.  The number of people that I know that have been significantly impacted from the shot is WAY more than the number that have actually gotten the disease.  By significant I mean missing multiple days of work.  I personally know 3 people who have been hospitalized with adverse reactions to the shot.</p>

        <p>You missed the point. I'm simply showing the faulty logic in anti-vax "critical thinking". I'm fully aware that I can get the vaccine. I also fully support others choice to not get the vax. Don't get butthurt if that limits what you can and cannot do in the future. I fully support everyone's freedom of choice until that freedom infringes on others', more basic, human rights.</p>

        <p>U/ikmp you ask fair questions.  I would say that the long term effects of both covid and the vaccine are undetermined.  We don’t have long term data on any longer lasting negative effects of this new virus, nor for the new vaccines.  Even if you assume long term impact of the virus and the vaccine have the same probability of occurring and same severity, there is a non-zero chance that you will not get COVID.  So you have to reduce the probability of getting long term effects based on some probability that you will not get COVID.</p>

        <p>I dont think we can assume that the vaccine and the virus will have the same effects long term, it seems flawed to make that assumption since they are 2 different things. I think the safe logical thinking is to look at the empirical data and make a desicion based on the path of least, known, risk.</p>

        <p>I agree that we should look at empirical data.  However since we are on the topic of long term health impact, that data is not available yet for either.  So in the meantime these are inconclusive.  </p>
<p>I disagree with your conclusion that we should go with the least known risk.  There is a cost-benefit analysis at hand, not just a risk analysis.  If you’re 85 years old, sick &amp; overweight, the long term risks of vaccines is not a huge factor.  The most important factors are the short-term benefits (some level of protection against Covid) and short-term risks (potential negative reactions, serious or otherwise).  If you’re 16 years old and healthy the short-term benefit is very low (potential protection from a disease that is statistically not serious for you) so the potential for longer term risks (even if there’s a chance they don’t materialize) become more important.</p>

<p>But is this not the same as what I said? We should look at empirical data available and determine which path has the least risk (or by your explanation, the lowest cost to benefit)? The path of least risk won't be the same for everyone. My only point is you should not get the vaccine because of the potential long term risks of SARS-CoV-2 just as much as you should not avoid the vaccine because of potential long term risk of the vaccine. I think we are on the same page here.</p>

        <p>You never got your smell back?  That’s pretty rare.  Everyone that I know that had any impact to smell had it return.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your lack of energy.  You sure you can attribute that to the virus and nothing else?</p>

        <p>Been 6 months now and haven’t gotten it back yet. The strange part is now I’m fully vaccinated and I’ve noticed it going back to normal. I have no idea if that is in anyway related to the vaccine or not, just an interesting observation. And as for the lack of energy, I’m planning to see a doctor about it soon. It started when I got covid and I’ve tried fixing everything I could think of that it might have been. Iron deficiency, bad sleep schedule, other vitamin deficiencies, bad diet, exercise, etc. Nothing has changed :( even caffeine doesn’t help. I appreciate the sincerity.</p>

        <p>cmon, the math is common knowledge at this point. the vaccine is less than a year old was my point. meaning we don’t know the long term effects. same goes for covid. i trust my immune system more than a rushed drug tbh especially when it seems to go right through me and all my peers</p>

        <p>To say something is fact because it's common knowledge is faulty logic. Kinda sad this is being said on a post touting critical thinking... If you trust your immune system the vaccine should have no adverse effects.</p>

        <p>I fully understand that a vaccine can have long term side effects. You seem to not understand how immunity works and how the immune system operates. You also seem to not grasp the idea that contracting covid can have negative long term health impacts, since the virus is also still very young. Lastly you seem to not understand faulty logic and weak arguments. I'm not asking you to do the math I'm asking for proof of something  you stated as fact. If you cannot provide proof then it is simply an opinion.</p>

        <p>isnt the maths just using population, cases and deaths together?</p>
<p>UK currently has had 4.4M cases and 127k deaths. so thats 2.7%(?) have died, but even the scientists agree the cases are far too low as many people didnt or havent gotten tested.</p>
<p>but going off the raw data they provide you have a 6% chance of catching covid (overall so that includes everyone who isnt wearing masks, distancing, following any rules along with the people who do follow them) then a 2.7% chance of it killing you. with 80-90% of those deaths being elderly or underlying conditions. thats a 0.00162 chance of death.</p>
<p>we arnt talking about 'long covid' but cases for that are low aswell.</p>
<p>the travel passport is also going to show if you have natural antibodies from having covid which provides 80% (estimate) protection.</p>
<p>it should be similar in all western countries, with decent base hygiene levels.</p>

        <p>If your considering that people should not take the vaccine and that instead we should rely on heard immunity then you can’t use the chance of infection as part of the equation since you need to rely on most of us to get infected to get heard immunity.
The chance of death would start to converge on the limit of 2.7% as we reach heard immunity.</p>

        <p>i mean enough people are going to get vaccinated to hit the 70% (or 80 some say) requirement for it to effectivly die off. </p>
<p>i dislike the idea of trying to convince/force people to NOT have it as much as trying to force people to have it or be a 2nd class citizen.</p>
<p>i dont want it for my own reasons and i believe we do need to hit the 70% target to be rid of the virus, but i dont want to be told i cant do X or Y simply because i havent had it and dont want it.</p>
<p>i also fully understand the idea of new variants and such but as more and more get vaccinated and older strains die off it becomes less and less neccessary for everyone who can have it to get it.</p>
<p>BUT the idea that if only me out of my entire friend, work, family, social group doesnt get it i will 100% get covid and create a new deadly version is just stupid. obviously im not talking about entire city states/countries only being 20% vaccinated. but for me and my little life travelling within europe for my holiday once a year im not hurting anyone and will most likely not be hurt by anyone else.</p>

        <p>The concern is the widespread vaccine hesitancy. To reach herd immunity a large enough proportion of the population needs to have antibodies at the same time. There are many (such as yourself) who may have justifiable reasons to not take the vaccine but there are also many fueling the anti vax fire with misinformation (openVAERS.org for example) or buying into the hysteria created by the misinformation.</p>

        <p>That's really what it boils down to, waiting and seeing. I just hope that through a combination of SARS-CoV-2 contracted immunity and vaccine immunity we reach a level that provides the herd immunity needed to get this under control. At the end of the day whether you're pro-vax , anti-vax, or idgaf, we're all research subjects and it will be interesting to see what we learn from all this.</p>

        <p>im very much more what i see over what the news says, around me there has been next to no deaths, very few cases and little compliance other than masks. so its hard for me to see this as a "massively deadly virus!?!?!?" when its done nothing that me or anyone i know/within the area. the vaccine take up around me is high around 8/10 people i have asked are getting it or have it already (the younger ones making excuses to get it faster) so i expect we will hit herd immunity in a few weeks.</p>

        <p>id say curently 50% of everyone i know over 40 has gotten really ill, nothing hospital related but been sent home from work or had to isolate. the longest so far has been 3 weeks of a constant "tired, cant concentrate, weak, not eating and toilet troubles" but most are 1-2 weeks of this.</p>
<p>no deaths or the strange red blotches as of yet.</p>
<p>just as an extra aswell i only know 2 "anti-vax" people 1 i work with she literally thinks its a microchip but doesnt go shouting about it unless asked. the other is my dads GF she thinks it edits your DNA and in a few years people will start dying of it. i mean they might but not of DNA editing.</p>

        <p>I wonder if there's any placebo effect going on with respect to the adverse effects. It's possible but I don't know for sure. And lol to the extra as well, those are pretty out there ideas. Thanks for answering my questions. Hope all goes well on your end and things get back to normal soon!</p>

        <p>Fair. I tend to trust scientists though, and the proof that it works without negative consequences is in me. As for the not feeling normal, I haven’t had my sense of smell for 6 months now and have had severely declining energy for the same amount of time, with no other obvious cause</p>

        <p>This is the point I'm making to all the anti vax faulty logic about not knowing the long term side effects of the vaccine, the "I'll trust my immune response, thanks" club. We don't know what covid does to the body long term either... period. There is no counter arguement and that anti vax logic is flawed to its core.</p>

        <p>You would find this study interesting - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.07993.pdf
It’s about the logic behind anti-vaxers. 
“MIT researchers 'infiltrated' a Covid skeptics community a few months ago and found that skeptics place a high premium on data analysis and empiricism”</p>
<p>"Most fundamentally, the groups we studied believe that science is a process, and not an institution."</p>

        <p>Thanks I'll dive deeper into that study when I have a little more time! I think I need to make it clear that I'm not in favour of all the governments' actions throughout this pandemic. I believe, at least here in Canada, there has been a systemic health care issue for the better part of the last 50 years, both in health tech and services. The pandemic has simply exposed what's been swept under the rug. I think a lot of gov moves have been knee jerk at best, which is disappointing considering we have pandemic preparedness plans... I think wearing a mask is no big deal and based on this lit review it's at least more effective than not wearing one so why not? https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340603522_Face_Masks_Against_COVID-19_An_Evidence_Review
With respect to the vaccine, I get the hesitancy but don't get why that same hesitancy isn't placed on contracting SARS-COV-2? I don't see how you can be passionately anti vax but be ok with getting the virus. 
Lastly there seems to be a lot of misinformation spread which can be damaging in so many ways. Resources like openVAERS.org are as reliable as Wikipedia and should not be the information one uses when deciding on their personal health and we'll being. Just like I wouldn't check WebMD to see what my "insert symptom here" is (because it almost always is cancer lol)</p>

        <p>I personally am not at all concerned about sars2 
The natural immunity we have from coronavirus in general covers most of us- these sars variants are 99.97% the same and the body recognizes and defends. They know that after sars1 infection immunity lasts for at least 20 years and the variants aren’t different enough to pass thru the immune system</p>

        <p>Well I think I answered that but here you go. I believe that this Covid nonsense has become an all out assault on science. Everything that was established science until 2019 is now voodoo. This boogie man virus has a survival rate of 99% for most people walking the earth right now. Once you get it and survive, guess what? You now have beautiful lifetime immunity. Fauxci has convinced people that you need this vaccine, gene therapy product, to lessen symptoms. It doesn’t provide immunity, it doesn’t prevent infection, it doesn’t stop transmission, the people who’ve taken it ARE the long term trial AND it will need to be topped up via booster shots every year. Why on earth would I take that?</p>

        <p>I'd love to see where you got 99% from, not that I don't believe you just would appreciate statical data which supports your statements. So, to clarify, you would prefer to get a virus that we don't know the long term impacts of over a vaccine that we don't know the long term impacts of because of "lifetime immunity"?

        <p>Emotionally driven or not they’re facts. Would you like the BILLIONS of dollars in fines these stellar organizations have paid, and that I should trust with my health, presented in a pie chart, a simple numbered list with the most fines paid first or in ascending order or bullet points? When Moderna made their initial SEC filing even the criminals at the FDA, more emotional ranting, said, hold up, this is a gene therapy product.  Page 70 this is also a long read but in the spirit of getting the truth out there I’m giving you the page. And finally I’m not taking any chances.

        <p>So point 1. Page 70 clearly states: Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and could act as a source of side effects, mRNA-based medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell DNA; however, side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mRNA medicines despite the differences in mechanism. 
The FDA considers mrna gene therapy, CURRENTLY. The FDA changes designations of items all the time based on research. Mrna based medicines are designed to NOT irreversibly change cell DNA; pretty straight forward. To close point 1, this document does not support your argument. 
2. Sure! If you have charts handy that would be great.
3. What is moderna's motivation to dump a dangerous gene therapy drug on the population? And don't say money because they make it pretty clear that they don't anticipate to make any revenue on this mRNA vaccine, according to the document you provided.
And 4. How do you know you're healthy and no have no underlying health issues?</p>

        <p>I would hope they anticipate to make revenue at some point in the future as that is how a business stays in business. These companies have pledged to keep prices low as long as the pandemic lasts however. (which is also mentioned in this article, although with a negative connotation attached which clearly shows the articles reporting bias)</p>

        <p>This is a great resource. It shows clearly that ALL of the vaccines are currently in stage 3 trials. Some people prefer to take their chances w getting covid bc a “case” means nothing to 99.97% of the population. 
The vaccine however has had innumerable complications, deaths and side effects. 
For “proof” check www.openVAERS.com. And no- VAERS is not 100% accurate. A dr or rn is required to enter the patient data and it’s estimated only 1% of all vax injuries are reported. 
YOU be the experiment, that’s your right. But don’t expect other ppl to be as flippant with their bodies and medicine as you are. Many many ppl don’t trust these companies and just want proof it’s safe.</p>

        <p>What is a great resource that shows all vaccines are currently in stage 3 trials? I didn't see you post a link to anything but openVAERS. OpenVAERS is the Wikipedia of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research and is OPEN source meaning ANYONE can post. I recommend doing some fact checking. I never presented my stance so you're making bold assumptions about my flippant nature. I respect wanting proof, maybe you could give me some clarity on what level of proof is sufficient?</p>

        <p>No. But I don’t use medicine at all. I suffered for 8 years of severe iatrogenic illness which has created unrepairable trust issues. </p>
<p>Do you think most people are unaware of the clinical trials phase? It seems that most ppl don’t seem to know which is hard for me to believe bc informed consent is a huge piece of this all. I know they sign off on that fact in the waiver pre-shot but it sounds like most who are vaccinating are completely unaware?</p>

        <p>That is completely understandable, do you mind me asking what treatment cause the adverse effects? I understand if you don't want to share. 
I can't comment whether most people are aware or not however, as you also clearly stated, it's a matter of trust. Some do and some don't, both stances are justified. Your reasoning is rational and respectable. That being said there is a lot people on this sub making false claims about the vax and making that the reason they won't get it. At the end of the day, based on the information we do have about SARS-CoV-2 and the vaccines the risks (adverse effects, death etc...) of contracting the virus are higher than the risks of getting the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I had an autoimmune that showed up shortly after my first child was born- in hindsight I think it was prob due to one of the last min vaccines I was advised to get prior to his birth- but essentially the autoimmune removed the lining to my bladder. Extremely painful and I used to pee blood.  I was bed ridden for the better part of 6 years. 
Inflammation was my issue but my team of doctors put me on drugs to address the symptoms, never the cause. I was on opiates as the first line of treatment for my disease which caused me not to sleep well, so then ambien for that. Then I had trouble waking up, so they gave me adderall etc. 
I was also on a ton of diff drugs such as histamine blockers etc, all which had side effects that I was advised to take more meds to combat. 
One day I asked the pharmacist what one of the drugs were for and he explained the side effects and it just clicked for me and I discontinued all drugs. 
I manage my issues now using cannabis and kratom and I’ve never felt better. I feel better then I did before that first child and I will never again blindly trust the guidance of ANY doctor. I do my homework and trust my immune system. 
It sucks bc there’s so many ppl trapped in that same cycle and this vax has really had side effects - my understanding is that it turns off the immune system in order to let the mRNA thru and they have no data behind when, and if, the immune system will turn back on. :/</p>

        <p>I can 100% agree that there is a huge problem with prescribed medication and that there is a lot of intervention vs prevention happening in Healthcare. I am genuinely sorry for your terrible experience and I'm happy to hear you find interventions that worked for you! I'm not sure if that last statement is accurate, if you could site your source it would be appreciated. Just based on logical reasoning, the vaccine is designed to trigger an immune response so turning off your immune system would be counter to its intended purpose.</p>

        <p>You have heard it but prob not connected it- the mRNA is considered “foreign” in the body and under normal circumstances the body would destroy and reject. So to bypass that, it turns off The immune system to allow the data in- https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html</p>

        <p>It doesn't state that it suppresses or turns off your immune system, though? Where did you find that information, I've spent some time trying to find it but have not found any reliable, empirical data to support that claim. Maybe my bias is showing and I'm missing the obvious. If that's the case being pointed in the right direction would be appreciated.</p>

        <p>And actually it’s not riskier to get covid then the vaccine- not for my age group at least. I’m 40 and my age group is the ones who seem to be having the most issues w the vax. I personally know 3 who died shortly after vax and one who had a stroke. Actually one of the ppl who died had a stroke first then 3 weeks later her skin “boiled” and even w morphine drip she was in a tremendous amount of pain before her death. 
The other 2 who died were 35-45 and both died within 48 hours of the shot. </p>
<p>There’s just a lot we don’t know and I don’t trust them with my life, which is what we are being asked to do.</p>

        <p>Do you recall which vaccine they received. That sounds horrific! I agree there is a lot we don't know and I think we can both agree that hindsight is always 20/20. To that point though foresight is a 50/50 chance, maybe the vaccine is worse, maybe the virus is. I suppose only time will tell. This is the reason the vax vs anti- vax arguments end in stale mate or, for some people, name calling and hurt feelings. At the end of the day no one knows the right answer. At any rate the bigger problem is people confusing their own, personal, subjective opinion with factual data. That and pumping piles of misinformation into the interwebs.</p>

        <p>No- I didn’t ask. It felt really insensitive to dig on the vaccine details but each family believes it was from the vax. The woman whose skin boiled off was in a care home and they were under orders NOT to vaccinate her but did so anyways which is advancing into a lawsuit right now. She just died 2 weeks ago</p>

        <p>To assume everyone reads this and knows it is violation of Federal law is also insanity. Up until 10 mins ago you thought only hcp could enter data here. I think its safe to assume that some people, following the call to action from some of the prominent anti-vaxx voices, are filing false or misleading reports.</p>

        <p>They estimate that only 1% of events are reported. 
I personally know ppl with severe issues who haven’t filed reports (bc they died) but assume their families didn’t as I wasn’t able to locate them in the system.</p>

        <p>It's impossible to reasonably make that estimate just based on how data and statistics operate. You'd need to have a good idea of how many adverse effects actually occur to estimate the disparity in reporting. I however do appreciate your anecdotal experiences, sincerely and respect that you have concerns based on that. I do not accept having concerns, though, based solely on openVAERS.org and/or what other anti-vaxxers are saying. I hope you understand what I mean.</p>

        <p>I believe a lot of ppl have a lot of emotions tied to antivax stances and mostly it’s due to injury of their children which would make anyone emotional. 
But I’m curious why people would think anti-Vaxers would be a part of this if they didn’t believe there was a chance for harm. Pharma has profits to watch for, but what do the antivaxers have to inventive them?</p>

        <p>It's an emotional investment. The biggest names in anti vax are too emotionally invested in their opinion that they refuse to be flexible in their thinking. Thus when the narrative starts to stray from their beliefs they create false narratives and fear propaganda. It happens on both sides. Also is very common in religion. People have too much emotional investment in their opinions and beliefs and refuse to consider there may be alternative ways to think. I'll say that I am pro vaccine but not mandatory vaccine. If reliable information is provided to show the error in my views I will openly admit I need to rethink my beliefs and opinions. It's a simple practice in being logical and rational. Belive what you want to until it is proven not true.</p>

        <p>But when there’s no data to prove otherwise and a lot of data that confirms, it makes sense to consider their concerns. 
A lot of people HAVE died from this vaccine. 4K so far and to date there’s only been 12k vax deaths since 1997. Thats a striking difference</p>

        <p>No - I think the comorbidity issues detract from the idea that covid killed people. People that died had 2-3 comorbid issues and they were big issues. Comorbid isn’t just allergies or being overweight, it’s things like HIV, cancer etc. things that kill people all the time already. </p>
<p>Beyond that, in the US, UK and Canada the average age of death from covid (83) exceeds the average life span (82). </p>

<p>This is the same rationale you used to say covid deaths are not accurately reported, it is therefor reasonable to assume that vaccine deaths are not accurately reported. Also, 95 million vaccine doses administered in the US and 4000 deaths, that's a 0.0042% mortality rate, much lower than the covid mortality rate. If we consider that these deaths are possibly misteported that number could be lower. I'm just applying the same rationale that's being applied covid deaths.</p>

While I agree it's everyone's choice this reporter simply created doubt by presenting unanswered questions. He didn't provide any substantive information and actually sited data from the same source to both support his argument and discredit the source.

I don’t think anyone from either side of the tv does anything without permission and a motive but I think he’s right in telling people to pause. 
I do think that this is genocide and they targeted a certain genome which has possibly been vaccinated by now. I’m not sure.</p>

        <p>Well how many people have already had it and been asymptomatic? I know about half of the people at my workplace were asymptomatic, and plenty of people just didn’t bother to get tested. We literally have no idea what percentage of the population has it or have had it. Plus we’ve been led to believe this is the second most infectious virus around. So what percent of the population should we calculate? Because it’s definitely higher then the reported cases.</p>

        <p>Sars1 studies. All of the variants, even covid 19, are just slightly diff variations- still 99.7% the same. The body recognizes it and defends against it. So if you have ever had a coronavirus (common cold) your body is covered. 
None of the vaccines can promise that. U have to continue to top off at the expense of your own health- most ppl taking this vax expect to be out for a couple days after bc of the severity of side effects. It makes zero sense to do that vs natural immunity.</p>

        <p>I don't want to be a pain in the ass but can you provide links to this data? I'm shocked that so many are sick and/or dying from SARS-COV-2 when having had the common cold means your covered. I also understood SARS-COV-2 to be a novel coronavirus and therefor our bodies do not have a preprogrammed immune response. Your last sentence seems like posturing, "most people expect"? I mean you can't possibly have evidence of that. I highly doubt there is empirical evidence of most peoples expectations of the vaccine. I'm not sure how you can come to a reasonable conclusion based on posturing and what appears to be statements with no verifiable data.</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> your own body's immune system. In simplest terms, RNA enters body, tells ribosomes in cells to make antigen, immune system recognizes antigen as unfamiliar, attacks antigen and remembers. Same as an infection. The only difference is that the symptoms are far less and there's no risk of long COVID. </p>
<p>Vaccines use your body's natural immune system. They just introduce antigens in a manner that doesn't require infection.</p>

        <p>Can you explain the utter failure of previous coronavirus vaccines effectiveness and safety, and why now, we should trust that the technology will be sufficient and effective, and not cause worse long term side effects or damage; or why we should trust the corporations who manufacture these treatments and who have entire legal teams on staff to fend off lawsuits due to other drugs in their catalog? Can you explain these businesses taking zero liability for issues relating specifically to the covid vaccines? It doesn't add up, and the science everyone keeps referring to doesn't even have a complete picture of what the hell is going on yet, and we're supposed to 'trust the science'. I do trust science, I'm a modern member of society, but I also trust the subjects of science that have been thoroughly researched over decades and long run trials under the scrutiny of peer reviews.</p>

        <p>You can't gish gallop away the fact that I studied this shit for 4 years in college. Previous approaches haven't worked, so we're trying something different. Something that, going by all the evidence, appears to work. Out of the 30,000 people who participated in the Pfizer trial, a grand total of one had to be hospitalized for covid. I like those odds. The rest of your question is just a bunch of the same question over and over again about "why would a big corporation ever need a legal department?"</p>

        <p>Because it <em>is</em> a vaccine? It's a substance that stimulates an immune response without requiring an infection. The fact that there's an extra step where the MRNA causes your body to naturally produce the antigen does not change the fact that it's a vaccine. But then, if you weren't able to use scare tactics over the definition of a word, you wouldn't have an argument.</p>

        <p>I do. Your immune system is arguably the greatest and one of the most important  mechanisms in your body. It has intelligence far beyond the scope of our understanding with the sole purpose of protecting the life in which it dwells. </p>
<p>That being said, I’ve had Covid. I am middle aged, healthy and have no underlying medical conditions. Covid for me was a mild cold. My husband never got sick and only one of my kids had symptoms (very mild). I took the antibody test and naturally, I tested positive for the specific antibodies. There is no reason for me to inject a vaccine into my body when my body now has the antibodies and was perfectly capable of fighting Covid without any intervention. </p>
<p>Many people are in the same position, especially young healthy people, many of whom had Covid and now have the antibodies. I don’t know one person who died from Covid. I don’t even know anyone who knows anyone that died from Covid. I know plenty of people who had Covid though. </p>
<p>Most people do not need a Covid vaccine and I personally wouldn’t take on the unknown long term health consequences of getting this vaccine when I already know my body is more than capable of handling Covid without any assistance.</p>

<p>Remember our bodies are designed to fight off illnesses such as viruses, and we’ve been doing so for years - we’ve been living with viruses (including the coronavirus) for years. </p>
<p>Nothing has changed, the survival rate IS THE SAME. The only thing that’s changed is the media’s coverage on it, if no one watched tv we’d all be living the same lives and YOU wouldn’t have noticed a thing. We just want the freedom to make our own choices.</p>

        <p>So you now see the circular logic of that statement? This is a faulty argument since it can be used both ways. I'm ok with getting the Vaccine because the known risks outweigh the known risks of SARS-COV-2. We can sit here and speculate that we don't know the long term impacts of thousands of things, that doesn't mean they are dangerous, it also doesn't mean they are safe. You have to look at the information you DO have and make a decision based on that. If you base your logical reasoning on speculation and hypotheticals you're only going to drive yourself crazy.</p>

        <p>It’s “faulty” logic to not trust my body, says you? I had Covid, who said I’m “okay” with it? I didn’t choose to get Covid, it happened. I barely had a cold, so what “long term consequences” could I have? Furthermore, the Covid vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting Covid, so not only are you taking on long term unknown consequences of a new vaccine, you’re also taking on possible long term consequences from the virus itself (which I believe is a scare tactic and not actually a reality for most).</p>
<p>But my logic is “faulty” bc you said so, got it.</p>

        <p>Ok I get your point, but I had Covid already not because chose to get it. I actually tried not to get, but alas, it happened. There’s nothing I can do but hope that there are no long term consequences.</p>
<p>That being said, I <em>choose</em> NOT to get a vaccine because there is no long term data AND I already have the Covid antibodies (which I confirmed through a blood test). </p>
<p>So the difference is that there is a choice for one (the vaccine) and no choice for the other (getting Covid despite efforts to minimize my exposure).</p>

        <p>Based on the data we do have the risks of getting the vaccine are lower than the risks of contracting SARS-CoV-2. Based on hypothetical possibilities of long term impacts neither is a logical choice.

        <p>I'm not looking to stop you from getting the shot if you want it. </p>
<p>The pushy hard-sell is really off-putting to a lot of people. Seeing the 0.5% of adverse reactions being dismissed or gaslighted isn't helpful either. One of the nurses who got tremors went to 3 doctors who didn't want to do anything. When she went to the ER the first couple of times, the staff were all over her trying to help. Once she indicated the suspected cause, they lost interest.</p>
<p>She ended up telling a doctor about the symptoms without mentioning the vax. At some point it came up and the doctor asked why she didn't mention the shot sooner. She explained how that went with the other doctors and nurses.</p>

        <p>&rt;    But this anti-vaccine stuff is not sitting well with me.</p>
<p>Do you realize: </p>
<ul>
<li>mRNA technology (used in all the covid vaccines) has never been licensed for use by the FDA before?  Ever?  </li>
<li>There has been no long term testing of these vaccines </li>
<li>the manufacturers have zero legal liability if everything goes to shit</li>
<li>there was immense pressure to get a vaccine out ASAP and who knows what corners were cut to support that?</li>
<li>if you’re under 65, you have almost no chance of dying from covid</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m pro-vaccine.  I have all the normal vaccines that people typically get.  So does my kid.  But this one just doesn’t pencil out for me.   Too many yellow flags, if not red flags.  So I have no plans to get it.</p>

        <p>No, that’s incorrect.  You are likely confusing case fatality rate with infection fatality rate.  </p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html">the CDC</a>, the chances of dying from covid for people under 65 ranges from 0.002% for people under 17 to 0.6% for people 50-64 years of age.   </p>
<p>To put it another way: for every 100,000 people that get covid under the age of 17, 2 will die, statistically speaking.  And it’s 600 out of 100,000 for 50-64.</p>

It’s some next level idiocy to be so dumb that you don’t understand that the “new normal” is because idiots like you all refused to wear masks and now refuse to get vaccines.

Most people don’t think like these people do, there’s varying levels of misinformation but these people are way down the rabbit hole.

        <p>Don't forget misinformation. I was presented with a document that proved mRNA vaccines are gene therapy. Upon reading the document its clearly states that mRNA vaccines do not irreversibly alter gene dna. This document (a 70 page SEC filing by Moderna) is being presented as proof that this is gene therapy because no one is crazy enough to read all 70 pages (I did, lol) will link if asked</p>

        <p>It's rather the other way around. Ppl here ask questions. Ppl like you, believe everything, like the flat earthers, the essential oil idiots, and the antivaxx ... Ironically, ppl like you are projecting, but none of you, have a single argument. Again, only critique :) Now go and shiver in fear, weak minded person. Put that little paper sheet on your face, just like those idiots put tin foil on their head. It will SURELY help you. Or you can just make us a favor, go get vaccinated like a guinea pig. Those vaccines, being a new technology, could be something good for humanity. We just need some fools to test it on first.</p>

Your thought process is just so ridiculous that people don't bother actually trying to have a conversation with you.</p>

<p>Well ... science can't explain gravity. We don't really know what it is, or how it works. Therefor, many hypothesis appeared about gravity, and all science doesn't agree on.  </p>
<p>Panda's also eat rodents ... you are at this point, limited to the science that say pandas eat bamboos. See what i mean? Now, imagine you start to cancel all scientists that pretend, panda eat rodents ... that's they situation we re in with covid :)</p>

<p>Not for most countries, and certainly not for the USA, UK or other English speaking developed countries which suffered or are suffering greatly from Covid.</p>
<p>&rt; Well ... science can't explain gravity. We don't really know what it is, or how it works.</p>
<p>While my lack of physics expertise means I can't say if we know what it is, we do know how it works extremely accurately. General relativity explains it, and is universally accurate.</p>
<p>There's no scientific dispute as to whether the any of the publicly available vaccines greatly reduce the risk from Covid and are vastly more likely to save you than kill you. There might be disputes as to which vaccine is best to provide to different people based on age, sex, and accessibility, or what exactly are the risk factors that make taking AstraZeneca's more likely to kill you.</p>

<p>Is it? Ppl like you, don't know what suffering means ... wait a bit, the suffering is yet to come. You have seen nothing yet xD  </p>

<p>Yep, don't you find that odd, that there is no scientific dispute, over products that haven't been tested, who we know no long term side effects? It is awkwardly strange that there are no disputes at all ... That vaccine, is almost like a religion. You have to believe it .. because the prophets have said so ... ROFL ...</p>

<p>What's the alternative? If we didn't engage in widespread vaccinations to Covid until the people they were tested on had lived for decades, the disease would kill tens of millions. This isn't unique to Covid; no vaccine requires a lifetime of monitoring.</p>
<p>&rt; They are forced upon everyone, for an illness that kills 0,025% of the world population</p>
<p>There isn't a single place which requires vaccinations, so they're forced on no one. At most optional activities are restricted.</p>
<p>&rt; why are those that say vaccines are bad, systematically canceled? Why don't we see them on the evening news? Or put on first pages in mainstream media?</p>
<p>Because such misinformation kills vast numbers of people. You don't see people who claim that smoking is good for you on the media either for the same reason.</p>
<p>&rt; Don't you ask yourself questions, when literally nothing makes sense?</p>
<p>Even ignoring "literally" the only thing not making sense to me is the bizarre hatred some people have of minor inconveniences (not referring to lockdowns here) like wearing a mask.</p>
<p>&rt; as i write this message, there are 105K serious cases</p>
<p>That's a massive number of people that would be vastly higher if it weren't for the enormous amount of preventative measures people have taken like millions of vaccinations. The faster people get vaccinated, the sooner everything can return to normal.</p>

        <p>&rt; the disease would kill tens of millions.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of ppl die every year. It's the faith of all mortals, and it's a normal number when you take a total of around 8 billion ppl. Covid kills much less than cancer, hearth attacks, strokes, etc. It's just a seasonal illness.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;There isn't a single place which requires vaccinations, so they're forced on no one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56812293">Educate yourself</a>  , instead of talking BS. <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14614659/st-vincent-residents-covid-vaccine-banned-evacuated-volcano/">Read these articles</a> , they re all over the place. This is called passively forcing ppl. Certainly, they wont restrain me physically to jab me. They will just forbid me to go anywhere, as long as i don't have a covid pass ... :) </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;You don't see people who claim that smoking is good for you</p>
<p>Again,  <a href="https://youtu.be/sxrCjmqRTz0">educate yourself</a>  ... it was pretty common back in the days, then things changed. And justice was asked, to pay back for all the lies. The same will happen with this covid hysteria. Ironically, ppl like you, will most likely turn their vests, and pretend they were never part of the hysteria.Fact is, all the restrictions have already killed more than covid did ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;the bizarre hatred some people have of minor inconveniences (not referring to lockdowns here) like wearing a mask.</p>
<p>The thing is, a mask as as useful to protect yourself against a virus, than a dunce hat is. But at least, with the dunce hat, you re not having troubles breathing. Surgical masks, are meant to prevent blood splatters in a surgeons mouth while he is busy doing a open surgery. The goggle he wear, are to protect the eyes from blood splatters. But none goggles or mask, are meant to prevent virus and bacteria to pass. That's why the patient also gets antibiotics and antivirals usually ...</p>
<p>Also, if you believe the mask really protects you, there is no reason to force someone else to wear it. I don't want a mask, i take the risk to run around unprotected. Just like i don't wear a kevlar vest, i take the risk to run around unprotected against bullets. Now, in case there was a real pandemic, I got a hazmat suit :)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;That's a massive number of people</p>
<p>On 8 billion, it's ridiculous. That is one person in 75 000+ ... You always have to put things into perspective. Imagine a small city with 75 000+ ppl living in it. One is hospitalized from covid ... only 1 ... not 2, not 3, but 1. Wh0000, so scared now.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; that would be vastly higher if it weren't for the enormous amount of preventative measures</p>
<p>Sadly for you, the official statistics show it differently. Countries that have taken the most measures, have also the most infected and deaths .. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The faster people get vaccinated, the sooner everything can return to normal.</p>
<p>That's the whole point of this subreddit, no one wants that new normal ... ;)</p>

<p>The total number of deaths each year is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-per-year?country=~OWID_WRL">actually about 60 million</a>.</p>

<p>It's not "forcing" when it's things you can easily avoid doing. The second link is more ambiguous, but if there's more people than space on the ships they must be filtered somehow, and what better way?</p>
<p>&rt; Again, educate yourself ... it was pretty common back in the days, then things changed. </p>
<p>You're saying that because cigarette ads once claimed smoking is good for you, we should see people who say vaccines are bad on the media? Even if the two were comparable, that doesn't have any sort of positive implication for your case.</p>
<p>&rt; But none goggles or mask, are meant to prevent virus and bacteria to pass.</p>
<p>Ordinary cloth masks stop liquid droplets, which carry the virus.</p>
<p>&rt; Also, if you believe the mask really protects you, there is no reason to force someone else to wear it.</p>
<p>The mask only offers slight protection; it's much better at preventing other people from catching the virus should you have it.</p>

<p>Only because of the vast amount of precautions people have taken, and those are just the ones very sick right now; over the past 18 months there are way more people who have had the virus and died or recovered (sometimes with lifelong damage).</p>

<p>Isn't the point that anti-plague measures are the new normal, and things won't return to the way they were before 2020?</p>

<p>Trying to prevent ppl from dying, is as stupid as utopian. It's impossible, and if by fantasy magic you would stop ppl from dying, it would be a real problem ... overpopulation is already rampant. Imagine, if no one died anymore ... damn ..</p>
<p>It is estimated that 100 billion ppl have already died, since our specie exist. Just imagine them being all still there ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;It's not "forcing" when it's things you can easily avoid doing.</p>
<p>Yes, being rescued from a volcano, is something most ppl could easily avoid doing. They could also just jump on the lava right? ... <br>
Also, you realize you ask for segregation right? What if we prevented ppl from entering bars or restaurant, based on their skin color for example? ... ho, suddenly your words take a whole other turn, when they re put into perspective, isn't it? :D   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; The second link is more ambiguous, but if there's more people than space on the ships they must be filtered somehow, and what better way?</p>
<p>Ofc, save first the vaccinated. Segregation at it's best. Again, like in my previous comment, how about doing that with BMI ... a fat takes more place in a rescue boat than a thin person, for ever fat, 3 thin ppl extra fan be rescued, as there isn't enough space ... Let the fat burn ... no?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;that doesn't have any sort of positive implication for your case.</p>
<p>Well, those ppl that didn't smoke in the 50's, had certainly not negative implications for not smoking \^\^ But what did they know, cigarettes were almost sold as lung cleaners, supported by experts ... xD</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Ordinary cloth masks stop liquid droplets, which carry the virus.</p>
<p>Well, no, as you can breath thru. Not well, but you can. As for sneezing or coughing, I always take my mask off for that. I did once sneeze in my mask, and had to run around the whole day with snot in it. Never again :D</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Only because of the vast amount of precautions people have taken</p>
<p>Well, again, statistics show different. Countries like mine, that had the most restrictive rules, have been in the top 10 for deaths and infected the whole year long :D But even in my country, the death ratio is only 0,2% for a year and half ... We lose more ppl because of the birth rate that is only 1,6 ... And soon, all our so cherished boomers will die, because no one can stop time and no one is immortal ... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; died or recovered (sometimes with lifelong damage).</p>
<p>It's called natural selection ... trying to prevent natural selection, will ultimately result in the extinction or a near extinction of our specie ... but talking about this in this era, would be like talking about astrophysics in the middle-ages ... xD</p>

<p>&rt; Yes, being rescued from a volcano, is something most ppl could easily avoid doing.</p>
<p>I said "easily avoid doing" about the first link. The second I said was "more ambiguous".</p>

<p>If your choice is saving more people or saving fatter people, the first is absolutely the right thing to do.</p>
<p>&rt; But what did they know, cigarettes were almost sold as lung cleaners, supported by experts</p>
<p>Experts paid by cigarette companies claimed they were healthy; they never had actual data backing it up and certainly weren't promoted by government and university medial bodies the way Covid vaccines are.</p>
<p>&rt; Countries like mine, that had the most restrictive rules, have been in the top 10 for deaths and infected the whole year long</p>
<p>The causality is very simple there; places with lots of Covid are going to impose more rules. New Zealand by comparison has a quarantine which has almost totally kept Covid out of the country, and so once you're inside the place for a few weeks there's basically no changes.</p>
<p>&rt; It's called natural selection ... trying to prevent natural selection, will ultimately result in the extinction or a near extinction of our specie</p>
<p>Covid is really not an efficient method of strengthening the gene pool; it only has a very weak correlation with genetically poor health (environment, location and age are vastly more significant factors than one's genetics) and few who died from it had much chance of reproducing in the future.
If this was actually a concern, even an extremely mild eugenics program would have a far greater effect.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;New Zealand by comparison</p>
<p>is one of the most isolated places in the world. I'm pretty sure, not many ppl died or got covid in Antarctica ... lol ... new zeeland. What a joke. Better compare what is comparable ... Lets say, Norway to France. Norway had not mnay rules, France was full of rules, even curfews at 6pm ... Think about it. Norways has 10 times less victims that france (per million that is)</p>

<p>&rt;Covid is really not an efficient method of strengthening the gene pool</p>
<p>So why the fuzz then? :D It's indeed, not very efficient to kill of humans ... it's just lie the flu. Why do we have to wear masks and have mandatory vaccine?</p>

        <p>So, because you care very much about saving lives, I understand that you're fully vegan, you don't drive petrol fuelled cars, you don't purchase plastic or plastic wrapped goods, you've never once failed to get your flu shot, and you spend most of your time promoting exercise and providing social interaction to the isolated. That's wonderful!</p>

        <p>These guys think that everyone but them themselves are sheep and that you are saying this stuff just because most people say it and it differs from the nonewnormal peoples "critical thinking". Also pretty common that they truly think that people do not care about people that are not their friends or family</p>
