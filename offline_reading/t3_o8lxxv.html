        <p>Tell him that the Lambda Variant is the next giant news story after the Delta Variant and the reason is because Delta and Lambda are the same shape as the pyramid on his dollar bill and the reason for this is the satanist elites are obsessed with numerology and empowering their symbolism.  Lambda being the 11th Greek letter is significant as 11 is an important occult number (6 and 13 and 33 and 47 are probably the most, but Delta‚Äôs pyramid shape superseded it being the 4th letter).  Nu is potentially the last variant of Covid-19 as the lowercase is ‚Äúv‚Äù - an inverted pyramid and it is also the 13th letter of the Greek Alphabet.  I predict either we get the nu variant or the Lambda will be the final major variant before Covid-21 is officially named and declared.  Nobody is taking Covid-19 seriously in 2022, even if they fell for the crappy statistics and the fear campaign this go-round.</p>
<p>Just because rational people understand that all the numerology stuff is nonsense doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not vital to the lifeblood of these satanists.  Masonic pillars have 13 rings for a reason.  We are being trained told to stay 6 feet apart for a reason, and that reason didn‚Äôt have a shred of data to back it up.</p>
<p>All this NWO crap has been planned for generations.  My best guess based on the individuals and organizations involved and the timelines is that there have been multiple probable pandemic dry runs for the long-term goal of worldwide vaccine genocide in 1918, 1955, 1977, 2003, and 2012.  We had a vivid description for 2,000 years of what we now know to be vaccine passports in the book of Revelation.  This slow-motion train wreck is excruciating to watch, and I think it is likely I will bury half my extended family in the next five years.  My 29-year-old brother-in-law lost control of his legs and couldn‚Äôt move his legs at all for an hour after his first Pfizer dose.   And he got the second dose.  My mother has been experiencing severe vertigo for the month after Pfizer 2, which is a classic symptom of blood clots.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm just sad about it.  The end seems near, and as exciting as it is to see it, we haven‚Äôt come close to the worst of it yet.  Our only hope is probably the sci-fi conspiracy theory of the ‚Äúmed beds‚Äù, like in the movie Elysium.  Anything less and we might lose the 1/3 of the world‚Äôs population that Revelation predicts.  This mass world vaccination is the ONLY possible way to do it sans nuclear holocaust.  Unfortunately if 1/3 of the world‚Äôs population dies as predicted in Revelation 9:18-20, it also predicts that people STILL won‚Äôt wake up.</p>
<p>We will see.  I hope I am wrong.</p>
