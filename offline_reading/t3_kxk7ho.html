    <strong>How about a thought for those who aren't "working" from home?</strong>
    <p><p><em>Disclaimer: I still have a job that pays well, I work full time, and I am grateful to be doing so. I know there are a lot of people struggling out there. But there are also a lot of people doing shit jobs in a physical workplace that I am sure relate to the rant I am about to unleash...</em></p>
<p>That said, As a manager, I'm getting pretty bitter at the "work" from home brigade. And I will tell you why.</p>
<p><strong>Productivity:</strong> Guess who ends up doing 50% more work? Guess who has to organize fucking everything? Guess who has to attend all the meetings? Guess who has to take on portions of other people's jobs? Why? Because, Joe, Jane, and Zoey are at home and missing in action - again. Not answering emails, ducking phone calls, out on the back porch, playing with the kids. All while slobbing around in their pajamas. The staff "working at home" in my workplace are probably spending 50% of the day actually doing anything.</p>
<p><strong>Accountability:</strong> Guess who the big bosses come to when deadlines are missed, stuff is forgotten, or the quality of stuff produced is shit? The person "working at home" who is actually responsible for it? Fuck, no. I'm in my office, and they show up at my door to complain - and demand, "Where's that fucking spreadsheet I wanted completed 2 days ago!"</p>
<p><strong>Time:</strong> I'm in the fucking office 9 hours a day. How much of the day are the "remote" guys really spending doing work?</p>
<p><strong>Expense:</strong> I still spend 350 bucks a month on gas, need to maintain my clothing, buy lunch stuff etc etc, while the "work from home" crew spends it on weed, booze, or gets to save it. And then they whine "Where's our tax deduction forms for working at home?" The words "Fuck You!!!" come to mind.</p>
<p><strong>Distraction:</strong> Thanks to "work" from home, not only do I have to deal with emails, the phone ringing, and people physically barging into the office, I get to deal with MS Teams needing to be running all the time in the background. If it isn't the constant interruption of chat messages from someone asking a stupid question from their couch, it's yet another circlejerk video conversation that would take 5 minutes in my office, but consumes 20 minutes of going down rabbit-holes on my screen. It's like herding cats with a fucking drone. Fuck MS Teams.</p>
<p>I suppose that "working" from home is great if your objective is to do as little work as possible, but for those of us left to pick up the slack, it sucks.</p>
<p>Now I know why companies have resisted this trend for so long. It's junk.</p></p>

        <p>Work from home is a gimmick- if you own your own business and actually 'work at home' that is one thing, if you are an employee working at home that is totally different.</p>
<p>I wont even try to work at home, I wont even try to zoom with my clients.  If you want your appointment, you get to see me in the office, I'm not dealing with your cat, your child, you pacing the house, you forgetting to log on etc.</p>
<p>I can't imagine how companies are doing this work at home, i cant imagine how traditional school is doing zoom school, it sounds and looks like a giant circus.</p>
<p>Now everyone has 30 days notice- back in the office- deal with it  sigh...</p>

        <p>I haven’t tried it, my job requires my daily presence. Honestly I’m a little jealous that people are able to do remote work, since I live in a very high cost of living area. If I could maintain my current income but move my physical location to a lower cost of living location, I’d be set. </p>
<p>That said though, I get exactly what you’re saying. I’m an electrical foreman running a new school building project, and our company’s office staff (the ones that support operations in the field) is mostly working from home. It seemed like the speed of information slowed to a halt now that people aren’t forced to come in every day to a work environment. Now when I call my project engineer I’m only getting half or less of his attention as the kids scream in the background or he decides to look over at the TV.</p>
<p>And you’re right, the people still out here have to pick up the slack, so far there is very little accountability. It’s easier and probably cheaper to lose production than it is to be sued in the court of public opinion if there’s an outbreak of covid at the office.</p>

        <p>I am getting so sick of hearing kids in the background of calls and seeing everyone’s cats on camera and people posting their pet photos in Slack. It was OK in March and April. Now? Well.....</p>
<p>And I like animals! My mom has dogs and cats. But after the 500th “cute” pet photo the novelty has worn off.</p>

        <p>I really wasn't trying to come across as a Luddite. I just think that given human nature, and the tendency of employers to take advantage whenever they can, WFH will be another example of "Be careful what you wish for".</p>
<p>Every advance in telecommunications/IT in the workplace has ended up being a net loss of free time, anonymity, and privacy for the employee, for example:</p>
<p>1910 - 1985(ish): "Give us your home phone number, so we can call you in case of emergency".</p>
<p>1990 - 2000(ish): "Here is a a pager, so we can reach you when you are on a date, camping, or shopping".</p>
<p>2000(ish) - Present: Here is a laptop with a VPN tunnel to the corporate network, so we can send you emails and you can access files at home".</p>
<p>2000(ish) - 2010: Here is a cellphone, so we can call you anywhere, any time".</p>
<p>2010 - Present: "Here is a smartphone, so we can send you emails, texts, and voice calls 24/7".</p>
<p>WFH is going to be all of these things, on steroids. I question where the benefit is to the employee in all of this.</p>

        <p>I got chewed out by our office manager for not having my work email on my phone. I told her that I don't get paid enough to do that and they don't pay my cell phone bill. Put some more shekels in that paycheck and pay off my phone, then we'll talk.</p>

        <p>Noticed this got downvoted, likely because people here have a hater boner for WFH.</p>
<p>My SO works from home, and also has to do the stuff you described. It's actually been very stressful due to the strictness of the deadlines.</p>

        <p>I spend every other day working at home and I'm the same. In fact my boss is impressed with how much work I get done. For me it's different my husband is at work and I don't have kids or pets so it's quiet and I get a ton of work done without co-workers barging in to talk to me. I kinda like the staggered shift. It saves gas but also I still get to come in.</p>

        <p>Trust me. As someone who supervises 30 other people, it becomes a real nightmare.</p>
<p>I'm not into micromanaging, but passing and receiving information becomes a real headache - and it makes everything way more time consuming.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be an issue, but upper management is still trying to pretend that nothing has changed, and expects the same productivity as if the offices were fully manned.</p>
<p>It's really frustrating.</p>

        <p>Someone said it here earlier, you're not working from home, you're living at work. Your job has crept in to your home life and your boss has more control over you than before.</p>
<p>The loss of productivity is real. When you don't have someone around the corner to check on you, you can get away with a lot more screwing around. You had a half hour of strictly timed lunch before? Now you get an hour, but they don't have to know.</p>

        <p>When this bullshit started, I worked an office job that I was already very unhappy with. When the mythical “two weeks at home to slow the spread” started, I was excited to stay home and work. </p>
<p>The novelty quickly wore off. </p>
<p>My productivity nosedived. My office is absolutely not designed to work remote and we went remote with zero planning done and the assumption that management would put something together as time went on. </p>
<p>I would have people asking me questions and I couldn’t answer any of them because I didn’t have access to physical materials (files etc.) I needed as I couldn’t bring them home from the office. The response I got for these concerns was “email your boss.” </p>
<p>Sure good idea, except everyone else in my office is also emailing him, on top of the numerous emails he receives every day. My questions wouldn’t be answered for days. </p>
<p>By Summer, my mental state from the work piling up and other nonsense bought about by Corona was reaching a breaking point. It was also compounded by personal issues, like the fact I had to cancel a vacation I planned to go on in April, which would have been the best vacation I have ever went on and was something I had been looking forward to since Winter 2019. </p>
<p>I started getting into almost daily arguments and shouting matches with one of my bosses by this time and in October, they laid me off. I was relieved it was over. </p>
<p>I work on a farm now and am much happier.</p>

        <p>I hadn't even thought about how much gas it costs me to come in and how 75% of the office no longer have that expense. When the schools closed and I had to stay home a few hours, it was bliss sleeping in that little bit.</p>

        <p>I was working at home before the pandemic started but I feel I get so much more done at home. I don’t have co-worker interruptions and I am able to concentrate on my work more. My job is based on projects though so as long as I meet my deadlines and show productivity then I am good. I have many meetings I attend each day as well. </p>
<p>It seems that some jobs aren’t suited for work from home though and if you have employees skipping meetings and not doing their work then you need to hold them accountable and put them on a coaching plan. If you don’t do this then it will continue.</p>

        <p>The problem is that the levels above me "work" from home, too.</p>
<p>It's easy to just push down dictates from on high when you are sitting in your couch in your pajamas and don't really give two fucks as long as you are getting paid. You can always just throw others under the bus.</p>
<p>This mindset isn't just a low-level employee thing, it goes all the way up. And the cozy coterie of "married with kids" WFH" protects each other - because whether they are a worker bee or an exec, they like the new normal, and are happy to leave the middle level management who need to be in their offices, swinging in the breeze...</p>

        <p>I am still going to work but my husband has been working from home for almost a year. He starts work at 8, he wakes up at 7:50, turns his laptop on, brushes his teeth and fixes his hair, puts a pilot on and "goes to work " he still has goals to meet but honestly he spends most of his day watching YouTube or on his phone. I'm a little jealous.</p>

        <p>I was laid off in June and received a new job in September. All of my team works from home but I have to come into the office. I was told that "working from home" was a privilege for employees that they trust. Meanwhile, I think most of the individuals here at the office have had COVID or have at least been exposed to it. </p>
<p>My co-workers who work from home get to run errands, spend leisurely lunches, go to the gym on their "lunch breaks." </p>
<p>If I wish to leave early to run an errand or pick up my kids thirty minutes early, I have to get permission from the Office Manager. When I am on call when I do have to work from home, I have to submit my hours to the Office Manager and HR while the rest of my team gets to submit their hours in the payroll software that they have activated at home.</p>
<p>We use Zoom rather than MS Teams, but it is the same shit, same dance. I have to have it in the background constantly. Meanwhile, there are internet outages, shortages, co-workers brats or pets braying in the background. </p>
<p>I would be for working from home if we all could do it. All animals are equal. But some are more equal than others.</p>
