    <strong>Relaxing the 'mask mandates' was never supposed to happen:</strong>
    <p><p>If anyone recalls, a few months ago Lord Fauci was wearing not one but TWO masks even after being fully vaccinated.  Rand Paul accused him of theater and this is when Lord Fauci first started getting legitimate pushback. His excuse at the time was 'the variants', but this message was too damaging to the overall vaccine agenda; too many people would not bother getting the shot if they still had to wear masks and it didn't even work against circulating variants.  So the CDC backs down and changes their tune.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few months (a little earlier than I anticipated- I expected this in early fall) and we are back to "the variants".  In a matter of days the knee jerk reaction to vaccine breakthroughs goes from 'rare' to 'you can still get it but the vaccine lessens symptoms and keeps you out of the hospital'.  Mind you, vaccinated people in the UK who were covid positive died at a higher rate than their non-vaccinated counterparts.</p>
<p>And the clown world just keeps on spinning.</p></p>

        <p>I’m not so sure, one way of psychological manipulation is to lessen up on pressure from hardship or oppression, then re-apply it.  The it serves as a reminder of what it’s like without it, and makes baring the hardship much harder afterwards. I’ve personally believed that the let up and subsequent lockdown was to coerce people holding out  into getting it, and increase hated of the hold outs by those who have already complied</p>

        <p>It was also used to sell vaccines to the useful idiots thinking they wouldn't have to wear a mask if they got vaxxed</p>

        <p>I see articles on both sides, some say vaxxed people are dying and some say non-vaxxed are dying. Which is it?</p>

        <p>all along the numbers have been skewed in favor of the supported narrative of those reporting said numbers. First they tested using 40 cycles, which amplified false negatives and played into the theory of asymptomatic spread. Then on inauguration day they switched it down lower and we see less. recently they changed it again back up to 40, and stopped automatically testing people who have been vaccinated. you have to ask and get approved to be tested now if you have been vaccinated.   You can see a huge difference in results from other countries where they are still testing every patient vaccine or not. </p>
<p>Also, because of the way the spike protein hurts people you are going to actually see more stroke and heart attack deaths, but those won't be counted as vaccine related.</p>

        <p>That’s crazy, so maybe an increase in heart attack and stroke deaths means that people who are vaxxed are dying in the past 2 months?</p>
