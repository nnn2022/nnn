        <p>&rt;  wearing masks to try to protect the community </p>
<p>Well that means these masks don't work because you expect others to wear them. When appropriate, the right type of mask can be used with the right type of task to protect the user. So the notion of someone wearing a mask to protect someone else it's BS. It's like you are doing scuba-diving yet your expecting someone else to wear a diving mask because you can't dive otherwise. That's how retarded that sounds with these surgical masks.</p>
<p>Also various cities in China have high levels of pollution which is very unhealthy. I am not sure how much a mask will do over time against pollution. Just doesn't make sense using cloth or surgical masks in those cases. A respirator makes sense assuming you use the right filters and change/clean them often but best thing is to live outside those areas</p>
<p>Under normal living conditions wearing a mask (any mask) impacts physical performance hence  detriments health. You don't need to take my word or read and believe some online document, you can test it yourself with/without wearing one and stress your body with intense physical exercise and see what happens. This should never been mandatory.</p>

        <p>Not really but it is better than nothing IMO. Not just that but the other precautions as well. The lack of people giving a fuck about taking any kind of precautions leads me to believe that if a seriously deadly, highly infectious virus ever breaks out, it's game over man. Game over.</p>
<p>On another note, I believe that China is the place a virus like this would originate. This is more r/conspiracy stuff but I think China developed and released this virus as a dry test run to see how the world reacts. To see how effective a biological weapon would be and if it could or would actually be traced back to China and what sort of consequences China would ensure for such an act. With how this went down, China can be sure that they can release a biological weapon on the world and destroy it if they ever choose to, with little to no consequences.</p>

<p>Most people could wear biohazard suits and it would still be game over for millions and millions of people. I think you're underestimating how fragile the systems we live in are. The domino effect a highly infectious virus would cause to our systems in place that keep society together would be nothing more than catastrophic.</p>

        <p>If a deadly virus ever hit the earth that has the contagion of SARS, no piece of clothing or 6 feet of distance would save anyone. </p>
<p>What the hell do you think essential workers are doing?  They are not magically protected. They are going out to work to keep you alive. If Covid was deadly, they'd all be dead.  </p>
<p>Basically, lock yourself in your home and shut off all your utilities.  That's a real lockdown. Now stay there... Alone and with no deliveries.  </p>
<p>A real deadly disease would mean no essential workers.  Basically, you'd have to napalm every single city that had any trace of the virus.  Or drop a MOAB (mother of all bombs); it's like a nuke without nuclear power or radiation.  </p>
<p>Surgical masks have always always always been marked as providing no viral protection until this year so that people like you could have a security blanket. But security blankets won't help you in a real situation.</p>

        <p>Most people would be fucked because the majority of the population rely on a fragile system to survive. A deadly virus would completely cripple the supply chains.</p>
<p>The majority don't grow their own food. The majority won't be able to filter contaminated water. The majority would be fucked if the power grid went down for long periods. Heck, a lot of people would lose their shit if the internet was down for just 24 hours.</p>
