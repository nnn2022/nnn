        <p>My grandfather who is 87 received the AstraZeneca vaccine. I was devastated and warned him about the vaccines. I am a creative person who was taught critical thinking at university by a philosopher, anthropologist and various tutors. Never planned it, just happened and I couldn‚Äôt tell too many people what I believe.</p>
<p>I was asking a friend in the army why do people not see the vaccines as dangerous. He replied ‚ÄòSheep bro, Its in our genes and it‚Äôs psychological warfare, brainwashed and lacking critical thinking intelligence.‚Äô Funny thing is, after all these years he said it. ‚ÄòCritical thinking‚Äô. We need to teach people to be more critical. Teach your kids and then everyone will see it. However most people are too lazy through television, tic tok etc. The elitists pray on the lazy minds and the ones who believe in the good. There not bad people, they just don‚Äôt understand they are living in chains, including myself at times. Plato‚Äôs cave has never been so relevant. Industrialisation has taken this world to a place that just seems normal for the average citizen. Everything is controlled to a point of absolute destruction, evil and greed. Sorry to say but we are on the brink of annihilation.</p>
<p>Years ago in my mid 20s I had a severe illness develop called Spondylaropathy (reactive Immune system) and understand how important health is. The illness started from a bacteria and then the flu vaccine promoted it. For years I didn‚Äôt work and I continuously studied architecture, geometry, meditated and generally building a view on the world. The illness hit that hard I could barley hold a book, sit down and my spine hurt to lie down. Eventually I got better overtime and began surfing which was my success in recovery. I studied pharmaceuticals and rediscovered most end up with other problems or potential symptoms. So I rejected the pills and dangerous drugs. I recovered without the drugs, by surfing, exercise and time. I am not cured, nevertheless I am much better.</p>
<p>I would die if I have the vaccine. I am a dad recently. People need to wake up before its too late.</p>
<p>naturally I pleaded with my grandfather. He explained he wouldn‚Äôt take the vaccine. Later that week my grandpa was convinced by our doctor and the media. Two weeks after the vaccine he had 3 strokes and is in hospital tonight. I am now researching to find answers. People need to wake up and I am not even angry anymore, I am just scared and worry about the future of My adorable 1 year old daughter. Born in the year of ‚Äòcovid-19 ‚Äò wow‚Ä¶. what has this world come to.</p>
<p>Too many people will live with illness and die.</p>

        <p>Supposedly the vaccine protein doesn‚Äôt touch your DNA, rather it teaches your cells to reproduce these man-made immunities.</p>
<p>Either way, it‚Äôs still only approved for emergency use and the Delta is less deadly so I hope they stop pushing this shit.</p>

        <p>I understand your concern. The problem is deep rooted. The problem as I see it is we‚Äôve lost too many of our values too quickly without replacing them with something equally or better. I think this is a recent phenomenon brought about by technology. For hundreds of years social change was relatively slow and things could be tried and we could see if they were bad ideas or were great ideas. Then we could adopt or discard them without too much pain because collectively we didn‚Äôt have too much at stake. </p>
<p>Now we discard tried and tested values and yes things like critical thinking without having a proper replacement. It‚Äôs like every few years there‚Äôs a big social experiment. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure there is a way out of this to be honest. Haha maybe a ‚ÄòButlerian Jihad‚Äô or something similar. Technology is changing rapidly, we all know this but we are not equipped to deal with it. The environment we live in today is alien to our primitive hardwired natures. Imagine what it will be like in a mere 50 years. </p>
<p>Most people can‚Äôt even practice a bit of delayed gratification for their health never mind anything more pertinent. We are like machines that are programmed then behave in a certain way. Some people‚Äôs programming is very, very basic and doesn‚Äôt allow for the better things such as critical thinking.</p>
