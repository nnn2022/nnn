        <p>Cool. Wear a mask if your sick.</p>
<p>Imagine if they had just had a massive education campaign. Please wear a mask if you're sick. It will protect others by 95 percent.</p>
<p>Done. No forcing anyone to do anything. I'll bet people would be alot more respectful of your "social distance" if you're wearing one. Instead everyone is a fucking suspect walking around with a false sense of security.</p>

        <p>I'm going to go based on the picture alone, not looking at the percentages but in the second picture if someone that is sick is wearing a mask and the healthy people don't, there is a 5% chance of catching the virus, going to show that healthy people shouldn't be wearing fucking masks.... get rekt cunts.</p>

        <p>For all the "science" folks out there. How do they even get the data to conclude stuff like this? Did they infect a test group with covid and give one set masks and another none and record the numbers? </p>

        <p>Somewhat, I dont think like "like" the right word. Its like if I said the sun is a billion degrees, so hot. Scientists would be like... Well the sun is actually this specific number but your statements general message is true.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Also the first we is whoevers dumb idea it was to make it up, the second we would be the scientists saying, "We dont have those specific numbers, but the overall summary is correct."</p>

        <p>I see your point. But my point is that if they havent done any concrete scientific testing, how can you even ball-park a number at all. </p>
<p>To me its like saying, the sun is really hot. True. Then someone says, yeah, it's probably thounsands of degrees. And then they do actual scientific testing on it and it turns out to be millions of degrees. The first two werent exactly "wrong" in their assumptions in saying it's really hot. But there is a world of difference between "its really hot" and "its average temperature after measuring is 171764.66 degrees celsius." </p>
<p>If the margins between masked vs unmasked were a lot smaller, like say 10% masked 15-20% unmasked, that would paint a completely different picture on their use and efficacy. Scientists just arent certain of their efficacy because they havent tested it in a controlled environment.</p>

        <p>I agree with your point then. Its dumb and just causes more distrust when things are presented as precise facts. It was certainly done with a good heart, but has now caused more harm than good.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are some pretty decent scientific testing now though, that do go into the numbers of carrier vs recipient transmission (whatever words you want to use). I think the consensus right now is from the scientific community is more that" Yes we don't have enough data to tell you numbers because tests are small or narrow, but we do know there is an impact of wearing a mask for COVID transmission. Even if its minimal its wise to wear a mask."</p>
<p>Actually in the original post I talked with an anti-masker that had a bunch of sources. Spent the time going through all of them and seeing what was actually being represented. Might be worth checking out, Im not a scientist, but I did my best to talk about their sources as objectively and fully as I could.</p>

        <p>Message links if you have them I'd be interested in combing through them to see how it was tested and the results. I've read a few that only provided abstracts of the results but not much detail on the control methods or data sources. </p>
<p>I am somewhat skeptical of activist-type research studies that are done with grants from politically motivated institutions. Objective results that challenge prevailing concensus is hard to come by because of lack of funding and publicity by mainstream outlets.</p>

        <p>Its healthy to be skeptical. To be fair the general consensus in most of these was between, "Our current tests have sucked and its hard to do better." to "There isnt evidence to support that masks are effective for Influenza, but they seem to be for SARS."</p>

<p>Some of his references were great examples that didnt support his point at all. Just cherry picked sentences from the articles, so it was pretty useful for me to look through it. Most of his citations are also gatherings of multiple research studies and are very open about what the issues with the studies are.</p>
