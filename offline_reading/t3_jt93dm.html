        <p>The government mandates that you wear a seatbelt in most places. The government mandates you pay taxes. Why follow those rules if you feel so strongly about not doing what the government says, when wearing a mask during a global pandemic serves the purpose of keeping our fellow citizens safe?</p>
<p>If you don't want to follow the rules of the country in which you live, (which, to be clear, we've NEVER had a national mask mandate), why not leave to find a place you can do whatever you want?</p>

        <p>But..... if I wear a mask and you don’t, I’m the one in danger. And you avoided the question. Why won’t you wear one? All it does is save people, pretty much. And if it doesn’t, the most happening is a slight inconvenience.</p>

        <p>Is it a slight inconvenience to have your business closed down? Is it a slight inconvenience to be forced to get a vaccine? Is it a slight inconvenience to get a negative test every time you travel or go to a concert? Is it a slight inconvenience to be forced to go home at 10 pm because of a curfew? Is it a slight inconvenience to be quarantined when you’re healthy? </p>
<p>The government will use that one slight inconvenience to try to get away with more and more and more and more until you have no rights and they have all the power and control.</p>

        <p>You missed the boat on losing our rights by about 17 years. Did you fight the government when they passed the Patriot Act? What about the Military Commissions Act of 2006? Where were the red-blooded patriots for those actual Federal Mandates?</p>
<p>(BTW, there is NO federal mandate for mask wearing. Still.)</p>

        <p>This isn't rocket science. If we just look at the places where the economy never tanked and unemployment remained relatively flat, what did they do differently?</p>
<p>They had national mask and social distancing mandates along with some kind of payout/welfare from the government to keep everyone incentivized to stay inside for a few months. </p>
<p>Look at Japan. Look at S. Korea. They're basically fully functioning now with unemployment at their pre-pandemic levels. Why? Basic common sense, basic manners--i.e., keeping a mask on in public as a courtesy to one's neighbors. But here in the US? Heaven forbid you're asked to make any sacrifice--no matter how small or how insignificant the effect on our personal lives. </p>
<p>Just a country with a strong contingent of childish babies who think wearing a mask to keep from getting or spreading a lethal virus is a bridge too far for them. At the same time, these SAME people are complaining about having to shut down businesses.</p>
<p>Here's the moronic irony of all this: <strong>If we all just wore our masks whenever we're in public, we probably could've opened the economy up to normal levels MONTHS ago.</strong></p>

        <p>That's evidence to you? Sounds like you really did your research!</p>
<p>Look, we can disagree and call each other names and walk away any time. That's all well and good, but I seriously don't want you or anyone else to get sick, whether we agree or not. The undeniable facts are that SARS COV-2 is transmitted most successfully by little droplets of spit that flow out of our nose and mouth every time we breath. </p>
<p>The easiest and most effective way to avoid breathing other peoples' spit is to wear a mask. This has the double effect of stopping the majority of the spit we breath out also. That's why they're so effective. </p>
<p>When WWII rolled around, Americans had to give up a lot of luxuries, and had to ration a lot of daily necessities. Meat, metal, blood, war bonds, etc. Were they communists for giving up fairly large sacrifices for the US war effort? Weak dummies for trying to help? </p>
<p>The other part of this is the idea of "our rights are being VIOLATED!" If that's your stance, no one has the right to spread disease.</p>

        <p>I don’t mind masks. Honestly I’ve been wearing them. It’s the business shutdowns, curfews and stripping of freedoms that I have a problem with. I just don’t think masks are all that effective. I’ll wear them for others but I don’t think they’re all that effective.</p>

        <p>That's fair. I don't like it either. No one likes wearing a mask, or keeping their distance. I'd much rather be in a room full of friends having a party. But it's a small sacrifice that directly contributes to getting our economy back on track--getting money back in our pockets.</p>

        <p>There's no evidence masks work.  None.  Let's put that aside though.</p>
<p>A government forcing people to assume they are sick, cover their faces, and treat others with suspicion based on the whim of an elected official is anathema to Enlightenment thought and the entire foundation of Western Civilization.</p>
<p>You see, in civilized places that don't drive over people with tanks or eat bats, our default response is freedom and individuality over oppression and collectivism. So dictating that everybody is sick and needs a mask all of the time is very much a primitive, inferior worldview.</p>

        <p>The size of the "piece of cloth" is NOT THE POINT.  Why can't people like you get that?    The point is being forced to wear it when the evidence of the virility of this virus is dubious , at best.    Besides, the moronic CDC just amended their advisement for masks, saying that they do indeed protect the wearer.   So you you go ahead and wear your piece of cloth, you'll be fine, don't judge people who don't want to.</p>

<p>No one can give you a reason to not wear a mask. If you're comfortable and totally fine wearing a mask, then feel free. If that's the case, I doubt anyone will change your mind. But it's unnecessary and I don't believe that government should be forcing everyone in their state/country to wear them.</p>

        <p>Literally 3 people in my family DIED of this virus. 2 of which were not high risk.  A mask could’ve saved them. How selfish are people that they whine and complain that they have to wear a small piece of cloth over their face. My 3 year old cousin does it and doesn’t complain. How are people so babyish? The worst case scenario is that masks don’t do anything and everyone has been mildly inconvenienced by them. 
And by the way, the stupid argument “well if you wear one and I don’t we are all good” is the worst argument ever. Masks only work by protecting others, not yourself. EVERYONE needs to be wearing one for everyone to be safe. And why not make the selfish, ignorant morons who think the disease isn’t dangerous stay home? They’re the ones who literally have the blood on their hands of 200k Americans.</p>

<p>That's unfortunate, but you have to realize that it's far from the normal. How old were they?</p>
<p>&rt;A mask could’ve saved them.</p>
<p>But you don't really know what caused them to contract the virus. And yes, a mask <em>could</em> have saved them, because you never know. But your lashing out over this is like someone whose family member died in a car crash demanding that we lower the speed limit to 15mph in order to stop traffic deaths.</p>
<p>&rt;How selfish are people that they whine and complain that they have to wear a small piece of cloth over their face.</p>
<p>How selfish are people that they feel the need to go out in public and demand businesses and other people adhere to their own personal safety standards solely to make themselves feel better, just so they can go get their pumpkin spice latte from Starbeez, when they could save lives by simply just staying home and being lazy.</p>
<p>&rt;The worst case scenario is that masks don’t do anything and everyone has been mildly inconvenienced by them.</p>
<p>I'd say crippling the economy, kids falling way behind in school, forcing people into losing their jobs and homes, suffering from starvation, pushing people to alcohol and drug addictions, being victim to abuse, coming down with anxiety and depression, and committing suicide aren't exactly mild inconveniences.</p>
<p>&rt;EVERYONE needs to be wearing one for everyone to be safe.</p>
<p>Precisely why many cities/states aren't mandating them. They're impossible to enforce, because many people won't wear them or they'll (intentionally or unintentionally) wear them improperly. Good luck getting everyone in the world to properly wear a mask 24/7.</p>
<p>&rt;And why not make the selfish, ignorant morons who think the disease isn’t dangerous stay home?</p>
<p>This would be a very valid point if the way the world was a year ago (the "old normal") involved everyone wearing a mask and socially distancing. But that's not the case. The "old normal" life involved people being social, having fun, and not wearing masks. If someone doesn't want that, then that's on them to change. Not everyone else in the world.</p>
<p>&rt;They’re the ones who literally have the blood on their hands of 200k Americans.</p>
<p>So why don't we all just stay home all day every day then and just live in bubbles? That way, no one would have to experience death from any outside factors. The reality is, we live with danger every day of our lives. You're way more likely to die from driving to the store to get your massive jug or hand sanitizer than you are from this virus. People act like this thing is cancer just floating around in the air.</p>
<p>Look, I get your reaction to all of this, but it's a very knee-jerk one. And coming on here with a closed mind, being incendiary, and bitching at everyone won't help.</p>

<p>Please show me the data that a paper mask will reduce the transmission rate of a respiratory virus - because I have looked for it and found literally zero. All health guidelines prior to 2020 recommended AGAINST universal masking for respiratory viruses.</p>

        <p>The O2 myth has been thoroughly debunked by many people. It's not an expensive test if you think everyone else is lying about it. Just by a pulse-ox sensor at the corner drugstore and test your O2 sats before, during and after mask wearing. </p>
<p>What studies have been done with mask wearing on bacterial changes, sinus infection rates or ... gum disease??? Seriously? What bullshit are you dipping into in order to believe masks have any effect whatsoever on GUM DISEASE? Did you get this from Q?</p>

<p>We could be dropping everything we are doing and all resources go to heart disease.. heavily educating on health preventative measures etc... you'll get rid of a whole lot more deaths than this pussy covid virus. and 220k deaths my ass. "deaths with covid" there are only 10,000 actual covid deaths and they bulk of them happened during the epidemic. Available right on the cdc web page if you don't believe me.</p>
<p>This shit is blown out of proportion. Think about it. Use your own brain and look at the facts.</p>
<p>Your facts are CNN and CDCs which doesn't even reference any real scientific data behind their recently changed stances. These guys are going to be making money off of us while ruining the world thanks to sheep like you.</p>

        <p>It requires me to play into the fallacy, I’m being inconvenienced (by even how slight it may be) and it seriously obstructs sports , gym, etc while the justification simply isnt there.</p>
<p>Prolonged exposure is what’s important , masking on a plane, train, bus, etc great. But being forced to wear a mask in any other activity when there isn’t prolonged exposure is based in fiction and it’s incredibly annoying pretending like I’m not an idiot wearing a fucking mask at the grocery store knowing it’s doing nothing</p>
