    <strong>Celebrities on holiday during lockdown...</strong>
    <p><p>...is nothing to worry about, <em>peasants</em>, according to the necrophile-sheltering granny-beaters over at the Beeb: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-55546760">Covid travel: Why Instagram is still full of celebrities 'on holiday' - BBC News</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;Some influencers and celebrities have been tagging brands and talent agencies in their posts - indicating their content shared abroad is sponsored or paid work. And travelling overseas was permitted for work reasons under tier four, when your job could not be done at home.</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad they cleared that up! Turns out if you just get given expensive clothes for free, you can go on pandemic-busting jollies anywhere in the world! You don't need Pfizer for immunity, you need Zara or TUI.</p></p>

        <p>Yep, I’m working on a long video about this over on my YouTube channel, NeEd InPuT</p>
<p>Obama and his family enjoyed a luxurious vacation in Hawaii for the holidays. Out kayaking, swimming and playing golf. While supposedly hospitals are all full, cases are up and we were all told NOT to travel or gather.</p>

        <p>You should also feature that attention seeking teAcHEr who was showing her boobs in Mexico on a beach while posting about how teachers need to organize to petition against having to go back to the dangerous classrooms!  She said that she was told that air travel was safer than a classroom because they have ICU level filtration systems.  Yeah okay honey.</p>

        <p>Maybe Obama is one of us? Besides he’s not the president anymore it’s not like he could really do anything</p>

        <p>Well shit, I'll become an influencer and say it's for my job; I'll reactivate my "Insta," tag random companies in my posts and say its my job to annoy my followers with shameless product plugs! Problem solved!</p>
