    <strong>Disappointed in TX</strong>
    <p><p>So I stopped wearing a mask a long long time ago. When the mandate was lifted I remember how happy I felt at the idea of things being back to normal. To my surprise, nothing has changed. Theres MAYBE a few more people not wearing masks but most people still are. Places like the HEB don’t even require them. Gas station, no requirement. Why are these people still wearing fucking masks?!
Well, then I realized the reason why... its because people want to conform. They want to do what the majority is doing to avoid confrontation. THAT is why they are still wearing them. There was a lady wearing a mask that made small talk with me, after I paid, I looked back and saw her tear her mask off as she walked out of checkout. Right there, that moment, showed me that people are still scared to do opposite of the herd. If more people take the mask off, eventually we all will. Quit being so scared!!!</p></p>

        <p>And I also find it funny how there are people complaining about Greg Abbott lifting the mandate, as if they are banned from wearing a mask, when the only difference is that it's no longer mandatory, so they should quit whining about it.</p>
<p>Anyways, onto your point, in my area since I'm in Texas also (Houston), I've seen a lot of maskless people here (including myself), unlike before. I'd say, compared to late 2020 where let's say it was 95/5 (mask to non-masks), now it's like perhaps 70/30 in regards to that, for early 2021.</p>
<p>Also I noticed (right before spring break), in my school, when some of my classmates see me without mine on, some also remove theirs. So it looks like some of them secretly hate it but are just waiting for someone else to stand up to the "rules" due to fear of not blending in or "conforming", like you said on your post.</p>
<p>Give it some time, and I'm sure plenty of the mask wearers will start declining as the months progress.</p>

        <p>People are afraid of some Karen filming them and ending up in some viral video shit. It’s a real fear I’d probably get fired if I ended up in one of those even if I was not required to wear a mask. If I were outed at work as anti lockdown I’d probably get fired. My company is very ‘woke’.</p>

        <p>Yeah that’s why I think people are being too harsh on those who wear it even if they don’t have to. I’m all for standing up for your beliefs but I have to keep my job. I’m not kidding about my work. My company is forcing us to listen to a lecture on how safe the vaccine is and why we should get it. They can’t force us to since it’s EUA only but they would if they could.</p>
<p>Edit to add my company is not customer facing and is not in healthcare.  No real reason why we would need it so this lecture is insanity.</p>

        <p>I dont know if it's conformity or just indifference. For a lot of people, anxiety caused by a likely confrontation is greater than the discomfort in wearing a mask. </p>
<p>I get that the mask is just one step closer to more serious things, and I agree, but where does that rationale lead us? To fighting about every little infringement. And while that would be noble, it would also be miserable, so cant fault people for not wanting to do that.</p>
