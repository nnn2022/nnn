    <strong>Thank you CNN and MSM</strong>
    <p><ul>
<li>
<p>Family more dysfunctional than ever </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My younger brother was a smiling and positive teen that used to play basketball Who I was the closest with before the pandemic. Now we're distant as fuck despite living on the same roof because my father locking us down cause my brother to lost interest in everything he once had. He doesn't even talk to me or my youngest brother because he spends all day reading books about the left and other political books he shouldn't be reading at his age. I doubt he'll ever return to his original self because the pandemic took a major toll on my brother's life. I nearly got into a fight with him all because I told him that Trump wasn't that bad president as the media portrayed him to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The media cause my father to lock down me and my 2 brothers. The lockdown TANKED my mental health and it made me depressed for a long time. Social media made it 1000x worst because I was seeing people having fun with life and enjoying school all because their parents weren't like mines. From March 2020- April 2021 I couldn't see my friends, couldn't leave the house unless it was with a parent. I couldn't go back to in-person school because my father was so busy looking at the "stats". I miss out on my senior year because of the stupid media that my parents watched all the time. Online school basically drained my non-existing energy at this point where it made me even flunked out of it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My dad thinks he "educated" about the virus just because he watched the MSM every time the T.V turned on. He claimed to research the virus and its long-term effect while in reality he just looked up the internet and the CDC. Even worse my father got vaccinated and he still scared of receiving the virus and he stays home all the time working 13 hours per day. Every time I tried to tell him my opinion about the media spreading fear he always tells me to get "educated" when I know the entire thing is bullshit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have to sneak out of a couple of houses because I couldn't take being home all day. One day I got caught by my father and he went beserks and he threatened to take everything I owned. Once again I told him this entire thing was bullshit and the "stats" he always mentions were false. He called me stupid which made me angrily leave the car and I have to spend the next 3 days at my friend's house. When I returned home on my 18th birthday I never got a happy birthday from my parents instead my mother was ranting about how she can kick me out of any time because I'm 18. Like my parents were so fucking brainwashed that they didn't even wish me a birthday. That said a lot about how much the media did to them. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sorry if this is a non-sense rant at this point but I'm just so mad how this covid virus and the MSM nearly destroyed my family. I never really had a good relationship with my mom but COVID-19 just made it 1000x worst. My brother and I don't even acknowledge each other anymore because of our different beliefs and hobbies (Somehow my dad thinks this is all normal because he read the bible and apparently he a "man of God" for isolating himself from everyone) I still have a relationship with my youngest brother because he always been an upbeat kid. My father and I relationship have gotten better since I returned by he always find petty things to argue about. Anyways I just hope the world opens back up because I'm just so sick of this bullshit and how it destroyed families like mine. Stay safe and live your lives!</p></p>

        <p>Hearing stories like this saddens me deeply, but at the same time I  am somewhat uplifted that some people, even younger ones surrounded by doomers, see thru the psychosis and manipulation. Props to you.  Stay strong,  you ll be validated one day.</p>

        <p>My mother called me yesterday, and although she did wish me a happy birthday, she also said it's because of people like me the virus will never go away.</p>
<p>It's difficult when family start to turn on you because of your beliefs, but hang on in there. Now they have had an injection (refuse to call it a vaccine) they are fully committed to the narrative and sadly, it won't be until the MSM eventually make a U-turn and start exposing the BS, that they will be any compassion.</p>

<p>If your dad read the Bible, tell him to look at Revelations 13 </p>
<p>"16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:
17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
18 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six."</p>

        <p>First off, I want to wish you a belated Happy Birthday! And thank you for stating your experience during this crazy time.</p>
<p>For myself, I´m 25, have worked with kids and teenagers in various roles for nearly 10 years now and I hear their experiences during the lockdown. Everytime I hear stories like yours I feel like what happened since March last year has been a war on the young generation by old, corrupt people who care about nothing but themselves.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sadly, I can´t really help you in your situation. However, I want to tell you that your future will be better than what we have experienced in the last 15 months. Instead of events you sadly missed out on, you will have new events and milestones that will be celebrated and in the end, I am sure, there will be something good coming out of this mess, whatever that might be.</p>

        <p>Wow I’m really sorry to hear this. This sucks so bad and I’m sorry you have to deal with this. I’m impressed though that even with all of the influences around you, you’ve still managed to see through the bullshit. My parents and siblings are all mostly in agreement about this stuff, so it wasn’t that surprising that I turned out to be this way. But I’m intrigued on how you came to these conclusions at such a young age all on your own.</p>

        <p>You need a plan to move out and get a job. This toxic environment sounds awful. Don't let it kill your spirit, use it as motivation to get out and become independent. Like another person commented, once you have some distance from them your relationship may even dramatically improve, though it will probably take some time. Good luck.</p>

        <p>Funny how "faith" can look like martyrdom. That's shitty man, hold out for redemption with them but don't be angry if they can't see what you see. A lot of people can't see what's going on and it's a blessing and a curse that we can see it. Much love brother man, I'll be thinking of ya.</p>

        <p>It's so sad to read about your situation and imagining similar scenarios for so many others. I'm really sorry you have to experience this. I understand you feel distant from your younger brother and that all hope is lost but I really, really, really hope you still try to hold on to a relationship with him.  Even if you have to temporarily put your personal beliefs on the side (you can and should of course stay true to them but perhaps just save those types of discussions for other relationships you have) please try to find SOME connection with him.  We need people like you to help carry through younger generations.  Even just reminding him that you're always here for him even if you disagree on everything. Hope things get better for you and your family.</p>

        <p>Hang in there. Sounds like you are at the point where it might be best to move out and rule your own life.  Your parents are unfortunately victims IMO. Hard to blame them for being scared because their authorities told them to be. I commend you for seeing beyond the vail. Wise beyond your years. When I first moved out at 19, I had a falling out with my family until they learned to treat me as an adult. Now we’ve never been closer.  Just remember to love them even if you do not agree with them. This to shall pass. Keep your head up and make the most out of everyday you have!! Lead by example.</p>

        <p>I eh, I can't promise I wouldn't commit patricide at that point. I do feel you, I'm 21, quite smart. My little brother thinks me a fool for not caring about a fine, got embarrassed so bad when i didn't wear a mask he just ran off, I showed him a comprehensive video of how the hoax came to be and this 13 year old kid stood up and said my mind is made up, if this was true this would be on the news....</p>
