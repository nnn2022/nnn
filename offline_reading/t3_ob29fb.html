    <strong>"Simply put: 'As we prevent three deaths by vaccinating, we incur two deaths.'"</strong>
    <p><p>Please take the time to read the full article if you have the time. This is so sickeningly criminal.</p>
<p>This study is calling governments to rethink their jab policies for "lack of clear benefit". <br>
It provides a great amount of detail and reaffirming information that is despicably sad to consider.</p>
<p>A few quotes from this study:</p>
<p>"<em>Currently, our estimates show that we have to accept four fatal and 16 serious side effects per 100,000 vaccinations in order to save the lives  of 2–11 individuals per 100,000 vaccinations, placing risks and  benefits on the same order of magnitude.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>In the optimum case, we risk four deaths to prevent 33 deaths, a  risk–benefit ratio of 1:8. The risk–benefit ratio in terms of deaths  prevented and deaths incurred thus ranges from 2:3 to 1:8, although  real-life data also support ratios as high as 2:1, i.e., twice as high a  risk of death from the vaccination compared to COVID-19, within the 95% confidence limit.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Conclusions: This lack of clear benefit should cause governments to rethink their vaccination policy.</em>"</p>

<p>First thing that came to mind for me:I would be very interested in the demographics of those who are at risk of death from the jab/that have died from the jab, who in-turn would NOT be at risk of death from Covid. <br>
I'm not sure is easily available or provided anywhere (that I am aware of).</p>
<p>For those who are on-the-fence with the jab, (or finally waking up), and are most interested in the statistics &amp; science, that would be seriously hard to dismiss.</p></p>
