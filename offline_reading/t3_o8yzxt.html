        <p>You will have to pay for your hospital bill if you get sick from the vaccine, and further won’t be able to sue about it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider what happens if you get seriously sick with COVID if you’re unvaccinated vs vaccinated.</p>
<p>If you’re unvaccinated and get sick with COVID, the hospital will write down your hospitalization as being for COVID, and you’ll have it paid for by the government.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you’re vaccinated and get sick with COVID, the hospital will seemingly write down your hospitalization as being for something else. Then, you’ll have to pay for your hospital bill.</p>
<p>In essence, vaccinated people have to pay for  hospital bills both from vaccines, and from COVID itself. Unvaccinated people, on the other hand, obviously can’t get hospitalized from the vaccines, and will have their hospital bills paid by the government if they get sick from COVID.</p>
<p>Seems like there’s a financial motivation not to get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>So, there was a person who posted their brother's story on facebook, with real names and pictures and described their situation. Her brother got severe complications from the vaccine, but the hospital just labelled it as covid and didn't mention him being vaccinated. It makes a lot of financial since to not ask if the patient was vaccinated and for the family not to tell, but in this case, even with the family telling, it was ignored.</p>
<p>Many other stories have come out of families having autopsies rejected by hospitals and bringing in third parties to conduct them. Further, doctor's have had their experience with adverse reactions uninvestigated, since the government said: there are no adverse reactions therefore, these could not have been them.</p>
<p>In other words, they refuse to allow the data to be created and published through bribe, blind eye, changes in definition or peer pressure.</p>
