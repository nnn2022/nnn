        <p>No we aren't the baddies. The baddies are the authoritarian cunt bags trying to eliminate civil liberties and bring in socialism using a cold with a survival rate of 99.85%</p>

        <p>Oh low iq leftist has no argument. You are pathetic. Let's destroy your world view on covid.</p>
<p>Covid is a cold with an IFR of 0.15% and a survival rate of 99.85%. Smart people aren't afraid of it. The common flu has an IFR of 0.1%. Most of the links below are either from Cambridge, MIT, the CDC or the WHO. Most of rest of peer reviewed medical journals and white papers by epidemiologists/ scientists so people cant use the fringe source cop out.</p>
<p>Tom Woods actually was talking about the masks causing an increase in cases early on...as highlighted by the Fauci emails. That video: https://vimeo.com/483358807</p>
<p>Social  distancing doesn't work by MTI</p>
<p>https://www.businessinsider.com/6-ft-social-distancing-rule-exposure-indoors-2021-4</p>
<p>Masks dont work, especially the fabric ones:</p>
<p>These are just some articles about masks:  not .gov links or peer reviewed studies so take them with a grain of salt:</p>

<p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8966883/Masks-DONT-stop-spread-Covid-experts-criticise-troubling-lack-evidence.html</p>
<p>Now for the more medical journal type stuff on masks (most of these are referenced in the white paper in the next section, some say they work ans some say they don't...what they all show is the mandates are worthless)</p>

<p>In the US if your below 70 your survival rate is 99.68%. The risk is minimal at best and way overblown. Did you know 95% of covid deaths are 80+ years old and half those died in nursing homes? For being such a super deadly virus it sure has no teeth. </p>

        <p>Short answer: No.</p>
<p>Long answer:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">CDC itself admits</a> that only 6% of the <a href="https://covidusa.net">1.8% CFR</a> of COVID cases die from COVID alone, and they have changed the way they report deaths so that <a href="https://www.who.int/classifications/classification-of-diseases/emergency-use-icd-codes-for-covid-19-disease-outbreak">anyone who dies with COVID in their system is counted as a COVID death</a>. Aside from COVID, these deaths are often reported differently—if someone had, say, tuberculosis, but they died of complications from uncontrolled diabetes, they would be listed as a diabetes death. Now, if you replace “tuberculosis” with “COVID,” it’s suddenly a COVID death.</p>
<p>Aside from the inflated death numbers that still lead to an actual CFR of .108%, which is almost exactly the same as the flu’s .13%, it’s not a good idea to get the vaccine for the reasons discussed in <a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">this essay</a>.  In addition to this, <a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">here</a> is a list of scientific studies showing that every previous attempt to make a vaccine for <em>any</em> coronavirus has ended disastrously, often with most or all of the lab animals dying, and that previous coronavirus vaccines have been shown to lead to complications such as liver damage, prion disease, and cytokine storms on exposure to variants. As seen in the essay, there is no evidence from the data released by any COVID vaccine company that any of these problems have been resolved in this latest attempt at a coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>In addition to this, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/thousands-of-women-report-hemorrhaging-reproductive-dysfunction-miscarriage-after-corona-shots">the numbers with regard to fertility changes in women</a> strongly suggest that the vaccine has a negative impact on fertility and on pregnancy, which is congruent with <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/">what vaccine companies already knew was possible, even prior to release</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577">large study</a> of the “safety and efficacy” of the vaccine has a huge hole in it—they merely vaccinated participants and then hoped and prayed they would come into contact with the wild virus by chance. But there is no guarantee of exposure—far from it—so there is no actual test of safety OR efficacy, when you consider that most lab animals in previous coronavirus vaccine trials (which were systematically exposed to the virus they were vaccinated against) died of ADE, especially if they seemed to develop perfect antibodies.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://id.elsevier.com/ACW/?return=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com%2Faction%2FconsumeSsoCookie%3FredirectUri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.thelancet.com%252Faction%252FconsumeSharedSessionAction%253FI2KBRCK%253D1%2526JSESSIONID%253DaaaxMgxF_jwLS9MicyuOx%2526MAID%253DnwtDnnX6yA6uoIcAtieLwQ%25253D%25253D%2526SERVER%253DWZ6myaEXBLF%25252B9vQ18y9JMw%25253D%25253D%2526ORIGIN%253D844971718%2526RD%253DRD%2526exp%253D75icYvzOgUVEevYEfIgkYg%2525253D%2525253D%26code%3Dnull"><em>largest</em> study</a> of the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines also has a glaring problem with it—it does not account for the incongruent testing of vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. The hospitalization rate of the unvaccinated is higher simply because the COVID test for a vaccinated versus an unvaccinated person is different. The one for the unvaccinated uses an <a href="https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/health/documents/cedep/novel-coronavirus/Ct_Fact_Sheet.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value between 35 and 40</a>, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">even Fauci admits produces a useless result, that is, a 40-90% false positive rate</a>. The one the vaccinated are given, on the other hand, uses a much more reasonable <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/downloads/Information-for-laboratories-COVID-vaccine-breakthrough-case-investigation.pdf">RT-PCR Ct value less than or equal to 28</a>. What this means is that many unvaccinated people are actually being misdiagnosed when they go to the hospital, whereas far fewer vaccinated people are.</p>
<p>Here is a list of studies showing masks don’t work:</p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664">Japanese researchers found that cloth masks “offer zero protection against coronavirus”</a></p>

        <p>Continued…</p>
<p>The reason for all of this trickery on the part of the elites is <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">the Great Reset</a>. Broadly speaking, the Great Reset is a plan involving remaking the world’s economic and political systems on the basis that what we have now doesn’t work. There are many components of the Great Reset, lbut the core theme of it is sustainability in the form of “carbon neutrality,” as they put it.</p>
<p>That sounds good on the surface, even if they are taking advantage of the pandemic as <a href="https://www.weforum.org/focus/the-great-reset">“a rare but narrow window of opportunity to reflect, reimagine, and reset our world.”</a> As the saying goes, though, the devil is in the details—besides <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles">phasing out fossil fuels</a>, they will be <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9501565/How-Bidens-climate-plan-affect-everyday-Americans.html">cutting red meat consumption to just 4lbs per year (a 90% reduction)</a>, forcing people to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/environment/2021/04/04/home-radiators-will-have-ten-degrees-cooler-britain-reach-net/">turn their heaters 10 degrees Celsius cooler</a>, <a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/299414/REP_Absolute_Zero_V3_20200505.pdf?sequence=9&amp;isAllowed=y">stopping shipping and air travel completely</a>, and many other things besides. Most ominous is the WEF’s vision for 2030, which involves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBBxWtKKQiA">people “owning nothing” yet being “happy.”</a></p>
<p>The first of two major methods they are using to begin is process is COVID vaccination, which they are using to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/05/15/vaccine-passports-covid-19-vaccine-verification-coming/7130642002/">introduce vaccine passports</a>, the first of which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/nyregion/excelsior-pass-vaccine.html">having already been rolled out in New York (the Excelsior pass)</a>, to which it is conspicuously easy to attach a digital wallet. And this will likely be the next step, given the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/benefits-cashless-society-mobile-payments/">WEF’s open support of a cashless society.</a> It does not really need spelling out (but I will do so anyway) that the reason for this is to remove physical money from the equation in order to establish control; it is all well and good if you have money, but if you can’t use it because it’s all in the cloud and you’ve engaged in too many “dissident” activities,  then it doesn’t matter if you’re a broke college student or a multimillionaire—you’re still not going to be able to feed yourself.</p>
<p><a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">The prevailing theory regarding taking away everyone’s property and possessions (or their ownership of them, at first) is that there will be a debt forgiveness program</a> (note: while I don’t know how true it is that that link is an actual leak, I am providing it because it makes logical sense, and shows I am not just making up my own theories on this). Once the economy has crashes, the government will say something like “we know the economy is terrible and you don’t have a job, the money to pay your debts, or the means to put food on the table; but if you join our debt forgiveness program, it’ll all go away, and you’ll receive a UBI payment, too.” But in order to join the program, you’ll have to be vaccinated and give up ownership of all your possessions. This would include money (after all, money is used to buy possessions).</p>
<p>The second way is through the budding cyber pandemic, which <a href="https://youtu.be/0DKRvS-C04o">Klaus Schwab himself said will make COVID look like a minor inconvenience, and will involve a grid-down scenario.</a> Indeed, there have already been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-fireeye-breached-after-solarwinds-supply-chain-attack/">attacks on SolarWinds and FireEye</a>. Most troublingly, FireEye’s offensive toolkit, one of the best in the world and normally used to test defensive software for large corporations and the government, was stolen in the hack. This was preceded by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210531124228/https://unlimitedhangout.com/2021/02/investigative-reports/from-event-201-to-cyber-polygon-the-wefs-simulation-of-a-coming-cyber-pandemic/">Cyber Polygon 2020, which conspicuously was planning for that exact type of hack, reminiscent of how Event 201 preceded the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic by just a few weeks</a>, and was recently followed by <a href="https://cyberpolygon.com">Cyber Polygon 2021, which began on July 9th</a>.</p>
<p>They will use this second line of offense to justify the creation of a new system, since the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, along with the shipping container and crop shortages (and other artificial agricultural vulnerabilities), will trigger a depression worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s and prove to the people that the current system doesn’t work.</p>
<p>That said, this isn’t even half of what is going on here, so I highly encourage you to look into it yourself.</p>

        <p>Start with this question: Are you trying to coerce or force someone to do or not do something? Is your intention to scare people thereby making them do what you want them to do? If yes, do some introspection and ask to why. Maybe you don’t fully believe what you are saying you believe, but want external validation? Who knows? </p>
<p>Nobody knows the whole truth, we just have our truth. That is why in my opinion it is best to just take care of your own shit first, then and only then, if someone ASKS you for advice or POV, maybe….. just maybe, give it to them. I don’t advise people not to take it even though I am deeply concerned about the whole situation on many levels. </p>
<p>Other people’s choices are other people’s choices and there WILL be consequences for action or in action. Consider this:</p>
<p>Scenario 1: You advise someone NOT to take the vaccine and they get COVID and die. (How would that make you feel, if you’re honest with yourself and not a sociopath etc?)</p>
<p>Scenario 2: You advise someone to take the vaccine and they get seriously ill and die or in the future there are severe side effect. How would that make you feel, if you’re honest with yourself and not a sociopath etc?</p>
<p>If people take it or don’t take it……. Not your responsibility. Those close to me know my views without me having to advise them to take the vaccine or not, they know what I believe. It’s their choice.</p>

        <p>From my point of view, many people on this sub are likely struggling with some form of anxiety. I don’t blame them, quiet honestly, after the year we’ve all gone through. I just hope that people take care of themselves and go outside every now and then. It’s not healthy to stay glued to subs like this, catastrophizing about everything that could go wrong with the world.</p>

        <p>It's always good to be aware of your own biases. I think that's a positive thing. Questioning your beliefs is healthy and everyone should do it. That said there are a multitude of reasons why there is more at play here than a virus. Watch the Doctor David Martin interview with Reiner Fuellmich. Look at the fauci dossier he has compiled. That should do you.</p>
