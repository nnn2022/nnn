        <p>The virus is pretty deadly if you are over 70, so you shouldn't do that if you are over 70.</p>
<p>If you are 10,15, 20, 25, 30, and you are healthy - the science literally tells you that you are not in danger.</p>

        <p>I’m not going to try and infect myself with anything just to prove a point, that’s stupid and unnecessary when there is so much other evidence available that proves the exact same point. </p>
<p>Am I scared of the rona? No. I had it and was fine with symptoms milder than my last cold was. Would I purposely try to infect myself again? No because being even the risk of being a little sick isn’t fun. Does that mean I think it’s dangerous for the average healthy citizen, myself included? No. I don’t think colds are dangerous for the average healthy citizen but I wouldn’t purposely infect myself with one, because they’re not particularly pleasant.</p>

        <p>Masks do nothing to prevent transmission of nano respiratory virus particles. Sure a few may get trapped in a ball of spit on the mask but a hell of a lot sure don’t. Most places have near total compliance and are still seeing record cases. I think masks are making it worse, I’ve had more colds since I had to start wearing them more than I ever have before, they hold onto so much crap. </p>
<p>And even if they did work I’d much rather get sick every once in a while than have every day be miserable wearing that thing. I have medical conditions that make wearing one absolutely awful and it feels like my life has been destroyed. So yes to me it’s a ridiculous gesture and I don’t do it as much as possible.</p>

<p>believe what the fuck you want, stay home, anti-socially distance and wear a degrading face diaper if you want to. why can't you 'true believers' just leave everyone who doesn't believe alone?</p>
<p>how can i catch this cold virus that nobody has? how can i infect people with something i don't have?</p>
<p>you are a part of the sickness cult, you suffer a psychosis</p>
<p>to answer your inane question directly, YES I WOULD "consciously make close contact with someone who is diagnosed with covid to prove the virus isn't as dangerous as the media is making it out to be"  because i do not fear the common cold, which is exactly what this 'disease' is.</p>
<p>currently there are a mere 58 people with 'active infections' out of 900,000 people where i live and none have symptoms. so how can i catch what nobody has?</p>

        <p>You're right, I'm making an appointment right now with the closest psychiatrist possible for this psychosis. I should never have thought this was real, who was I thinking. I should be more like you, a free thinker. Someone who seeks the truth, and isn't afraid of the common cold. Thank you for opening my eyes. I should call my mother.</p>

<p>statistically speaking most of us have already been in close and/or extended proximity to an infected person. maybe they were asymptomatic, maybe i have been asymptomatic. who knows. and more importantly, who cares at this point?</p>

        <p>right? none of that sounds bad in the least.</p>
<p>last Christmas when i was sick with the flu, i stayed home for two weeks and skipped one of my best friend's 40th birthdays. and she was mad at me and said i should have come anyway!</p>
<p>i don't know what happened to common sense since March 2020. how hard is it to stay at home for a couple of weeks and minimize your external activities? it's okay to skip the gym, it's okay to take off from work.</p>
<p>i will say that i hope this has been a huge wake-up call for companies in the U.S. that don't offer generous sick leave to their employees. i know we love our American work ethic in pursuit of the almighty dollar, but FFS, just let people stay the fuck home without worrying about their paychecks/benefits when they fall ill.  no, please don't bring those germs into work, keep them to yourself, we've got you covered here.</p>

        <p>Yep. I agree stick people should stay home. It was kind of nice to stay home when sick and not worry about being told off for it. I could focus on sleeping and actually recovered quicker because of it. I’d say I was only sick for three days. 
But lockdowns and forcing healthy people to quarantine for MONTHS on end is just not ok.</p>

        <p>it's batshit crazy. now how do we walk people back from that ledge of insanity to the safer side of the pier known as paid leave? also like, letting grown adults make decisions for themselves and their families. we're not programmed to worry about everyone else all the time. our poor little brains are so overwhelmed, please give us a break!</p>

        <p>Over 90% of positives are false positives. </p>
<p>So there is no such thing as a legit Covid diagnosis. It's just the flu</p>
<p>So yes. I've had my flu shot.</p>
<p>And yes. Nursed my roommate back to health when she got it in February. </p>

        <p>I mean...define close contact? Would I be closer than six feet apart without masks while we wait in line at the grocery store? Yeah. Would I stand cheek to cheek with them while they cough up a lung without covering their mouth? No.</p>
<p>And that would be my answer for any illness, even the common cold. </p>
<p>I wouldn't consciously get as close to them as I could if I knew they were sick just to prove a point. But just a normal day, I have no idea they are sick, we are closer than 6 feet without masks but not on top of each other and they aren't coughing directly in my face? Sure.</p>

        <p>If someone had the flu would we consciously make close contact with them to prove the flu isnt as dangerous as the media is making it out to be? What kind of a dipshit question is this? </p>
<p>You try to grasp onto anything to try and convince yourselves everything the TV tells you is all real, you guys truly believe your heroes meanwhile the majority of the world looks at you like the sheep you are, the most uneducated, self absorbed scum we have among us.</p>
<p>Should we go by what your favorite facebook group says and CNN or the actual CDC and WHO who have already told us online masks dont do anything, only 6% of people in the US actually died from covid itself, that your risk is what 0.02% of death etc you people think your somehow smarter then us the people who read the white papers, your truly pathetic.</p>
<p>99% survival rate and you want to wear a mask all day and shut down everyone's business and life, thank god the flu is down 98% this year wouldn't want the flu plus somthing less deadly then the flu.. this is the reason your kind will take the vaccine first, it's going to make things better for us all dont worry, CNN just said dont be alarmed when you see reports of people dying from the vaccine that's normal based on the elderly population getting it first nothing to worry about lol </p>
<p>The hero's better hope they have more super powers then wearing a mask in the car and yelling at everyone they disagree with they are gonna need it.</p>

        <p>I was around my sister when she had it. No one else in the family caught it, and she's completely fine now. It's not a big deal. I usually avoid being around people who are sick in general though, and just ascribe the same common sense rule to this virus. It's really no different.</p>
