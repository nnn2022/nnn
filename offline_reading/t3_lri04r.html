    <strong>Working in construction is refreshing.</strong>
    <p><p>I switched my job from retail to construction and I never felt so content with my life. No uptight dickheads getting pissy at everything. You don't have 5 managers that you have to answer to. You can actually make jokes and kick shit with your coworkers. You actually see the results of your work and you have to actually use your brain to make solutions to various problems. You don't have to deal with entitled/stupid customers.  You make a whole lot more I would whole heartedly recommend considering a trade job if you feel like college or retail sucks.</p></p>

        <p>Thats the best benefit honestly, Being able to go past a building and say I built that or showing your boss your craftsmanship is infinitely more rewarding than retail.. Im not a plumber or an electrician but Because my company subcontracts them and I work around them I learned some basic plumbing and electrical concepts.</p>

        <p>I've been doing odd construction jobs on and off. I agree. Only wear gloves and a masks when it actually makes sense like dealing with saw dust and fine dust and and sharp debris. Plus you learn a lot.</p>

        <p>I was working at lowes mixing paint and i start talking to a customer about government fraud or something and he turned out to be a contractor and he asked if I want to do a gig because I was hard working  and courtious compared to my co-workers so i said sure money's money. My first contract was demolition of a kitchen. I didn't need any tools or anything because they were provided so after every day he gave me a flat 150 cash since it was a gig. I got paid almost 1.5x a day more in construction than at lowes and he said to call him if i wanted more work so I continue working at lowes and a customer really pissed me off( he was trying to get an incompatible paint mixed) and i put my 2 weeks and joined his crew. My company focuses on renovation( mostly carpentry) and demolition. So they taught me things along the way. I was fortunate that my co-workers were chill and patient and I've been there since. I don't know everything about everything but I know a decent amount and compared to lowes I make around 2.5x as much. One of the best choices that I've made. At lowes i couldn't really have a sense of humor or anything because hr or a manager would scold me. But it's much different in construction. My boss doesn't breath down my neck and change my assignment ever 30 minutes. And i actually want to do a good job where as in lowes everything was a massive chore.</p>

        <p>That’s a great story and I’m happy you’ve moved on to bigger and better things. I’m not positive on which aspect of carpentry I want to get involved in. I just know I want to work with houses, repairs, fixing, building type deal. I don’t really know anything about unions, but I thought about going to a trade school, but I don’t want to make the wrong trade to get training for. I noticed you get certified in a specific type of carpentry.. like one person does floors, another does roofing, another does cabinets, etc. I would like to learn all of it tbh lol. I just don’t know where to begin but I’ve been interested since last summer..</p>

        <p>There's a few kinds of carpentry there's framing(you build the skeleton of the house) there's cabinetry and jointery ( you make special furniture/cabinets) there's wood turning( not really carpentry but it's using a lathe to make things like bowls and lamps out of wood.) finish work( installing moldings,spackeling drywalling putting in floors) Generally company's are either big or small both have their pros and cons in small companys you get to do everything because theses simply not enough for specialised work so you do a bit of everything flooring framing spackling etc but you don't get benefits and work can be on and off in a big company you might be assigned a specialised role and you get benefits but all of that comes out of your paycheck. Big companies might have you transfered from crew to crew so you might not always work with the same people or in the same location. Unions vary some are really good some suck. Ask around because the union in your area might be crappy or it might be good. Unions have very strict standards for work and you might need a few years of experience to get in ( assuming that you don't take a training program with them) union benefits vary from higher wages to healthcare to Making it hard to fire you. You would have to talk to the local union rep as an example in nyc the electricians union is called local 3 and they handle lots of government contracts. If youre concerned about learning the wrong trade try it out first at a job site to see if you like it. If you do then you can go into trade school. If not keep doing other things untill you find something that you like ( let's say that you work with some hvac specialists as an apprentice and you don't like it find a job as an apprentice with some roofers and let's say you like that so you would go to trade school for that)  everytrade is unique and the only way to find what you like is to try it.</p>

        <p>Unions are very selective of who they accept and they don't want people who will quit. So I would only apply to a union if I knew for sure that i wanted to do a particular thing. If you want to dip your toes in look up general contractor/ laborer jobs( you could probably stand outside of the home depot or something) and ask contractors if the need a day laborer. as a day laborer expect to do a lot of work for not the greatest pay this is how they filter out people who the company doesn't want. If you prove yourself they'll make you permanent and give you more money.and you will do a bit of everything. Start off as a day laborer first, work for a day with one company then work another day with another etc.</p>
