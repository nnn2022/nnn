    <strong>Socioeconomic Status Responsible for Better Outcomes for Vaccinated?</strong>
    <p><p>Hi friends! I have a question for some of the more stats-y folks here. I'm a data scientist by trade and the following dynamic occurred to me last night while I was in bed.</p>
<p>With breakthrough infections becoming more and more common, the CDC's logic for still getting vaccinated is something like the following:</p>
<p>&rt;The vaccine is not meant to completely block infection. The real value is in preventing serious illness and death. 94% of covid deaths and hospitalizations are from unvaccinated people. [<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/vast-majority-icu-patients-covid-19-unvaccinated-abc/story?id=79128401">link</a>]</p>
<p>In a pure experiment, this would be a good justification. Random assignment and blind treatments allow you to make statements about causality. You can say "getting vaccinated leads to better outcomes", because the only difference in the test and control groups (in the aggregate) is the treatment.</p>
<p>That's not what's happening though. These numbers are observational, so we'd have to control for other factors.</p>
<p>Access to quality healthcare seems to be a major confounder here. People who have good health insurance are less likely to be hospitalized <em>for any reason.</em> We've seen that upper-middle class folks (techies, professionals, coastal elites™️) have super high vaccination rates. We've also seen that minority communities tend to have lower vaccination rates. So the people who are being vaccinated are likely disproportionately white with higher socioeconomic status. My intuition is that these people rarely spend time in the hospital. I can't say the same for minority, lower SES communities.</p>
<p>With this being the case, we would expect to see worse outcomes for the folks who <em>happen</em> to be unvaccinated. This would be the case whether or not the vaccine actually did anything. When you add a seasonal respiratory virus into the mix, the effect is even more pronounced.</p>
<p>Has anyone seen a causal analysis that controls for these factors? The CDC is treating the datapoint as clear evidence that the vaccine is responsible for better outcomes. I wouldn't be surprised if the effect is much less pronounced after controlling for other factors.</p></p>

        <p>Very interesting question! If it hasn’t been factored in, it definitely needs to be.</p>

        <p>Everything you’re talking about is above my pay grade. I’d like to see what you think about this if that’s ok. I got into a conversation with u/fearless-leg7180 who also claims to be an analyst. Would you agree with his assessment that the vaccination rate makes no sense and has to be closer to 40 than to 70 percent?</p>
<p>“I am an analyst by trade. I just ran the data using 2019 census numbers and reported populations by demographic/race. I included children 12-17 and all adults 18+ to account for all populations available to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>The total population of 12+ persons in the US is roughly 234,144,465 people based on 2019 census data. Using the linked CDC vaccination rate by race percentages, I calculated the number of people of each race that has been vaccinated. Totaling 113,386,460 people, out of a total population of around 327,240,000 people.</p>
<p>Then using the sum of all races with at least 1 vaccine calculated above (113,386,460 persons), I divided by the total population of persons in the US 12+ years old. </p>
<p>This yields that 35% of the US population has been vaccinated. (Total # of vaccines/Total # of persons | 113,386,460/328,240,000) OR This yields that 48% of the eligible population (12+ years old) has been vaccinated. (Total # of vaccines/Total # of persons 12+ | 113,386,460/234,144,465)</p>
<p>I’m working on a new table seeing if maybe they are spinning it somehow (I may have Goofed the last calculation listed above because of population percentages) just to see if I can get anywhere near that number. Edit: data calculated.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I decided to also calculate percentages of total 12+ population by race. Once again, using 2019 census data.
Using the 234,144,465 12+ persons I calculated earlier, I then used census data to multiply proportionally by percentage of race in the US. This gave me the number of 12+ persons by race. Totaling 270,671,001 persons. (The census percentages of each race sum to 115.60% due to mixed race persons).</p>
<p>Treating only the eligible population as the whole population, I then performed the same calculation as my other comment. Multiplying the number of persons 12+ from each race by the CDC provided vaccinated percentages by race. This summed to 93,708,127 persons 12+ that are vaccinated.</p>
<p>Last, calculating the vaccination rate I took the Total vaccinated 12+ persons / Total 12+ persons (93,708,127/270,671,001) to get a vaccination rate of 35%. Just for shits and giggles:</p>
<p>Summed 12+ vaccinated persons by census race distribution / Calculated 12+ persons without census multiple race adjustment: 93,708,127/234,144,465 = 40% vaccinated with one dose.</p>
<p>Shits and gigs 2.0: Total population vaccinated (calculated above) / total 12+ persons with Census race adjustment: 113,386,460/270,671,001 = 42% </p>
<p>I’m out of angles to look at this. The percentages I’m calculating are fairly consistent and even with boosted/somewhat dishonest analysis I still cannot get a number close to 70%. Conclusion: it’s a sham.</p>
<p>Posted calculations above. My last possible calculation is doing exactly what the CDC data and article title says. Total vaccinated population as a percentage of population by race / Total ADULTS 18+ 113,386,460/209,128,094 = 54% Still nowhere close. I’m out of ideas and ways to look at this.”</p>
<p>Heres the race data he used</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. As a measly data analyst, I’m intrigued to see how a data scientist views this. </p>
<p>He may have better insight as to how the cdc is capturing this data so that they can project these numbers, as I do not have too extensive of knowledge in the data science field. I just later analyze what data scientists provide to me lol.</p>

        <p>You bring up good points, but even if you adjusted for race and SES you would still be missing a bunch of factors:</p>
<p>-Vaccinated people are more worried by the virus according to polls. That means they probably still socially distance more.</p>
<p>-Human beings cluster together in similar groups. Vaccinated people will tend to live in households with other people who were vaccinated and practice social distancing. Unvaccinated people live around unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>-Vaccinated people are likely to have had higher pre-existing immunity. After all, you're more inclined to get vaccinated if you've seen a household member get severely ill.</p>
<p>-The numbers are bunk anyway because the first fourteen days or so after being vaccinated you still count as "unvaccinated" in the statistics. During that period, your chances of getting infected are actually increased.</p>
<p>What I would say instead is: Take Israel and the United Kingdom. Look at their number of hospital admissions now and compare them to their hospital admissions 365 days ago.</p>
<p>Then you can see what's going on.</p>

        <p>Amazing observations! I agree with your final takeaway of focusing on hospitalization pre and post vaccination. The selective, biased data communication I've seen so far is maddening.</p>

        <p>I would be curious if those vaccinated who then succumbed to covid had been strict  in their social distancing and felt safe to renter society after vaccination? Maybe either way they were more susceptible to getting covid for whatever reason covid seems to go after people and the vaccine was the vector that let their guard down. Of course we will never know the stats of these people - obesity, diabetes, and other comorbidities because it doesn’t fit the narrative of everyone needing to be in fear</p>

        <p>I get that race and socioeconomic status isn't everything, but the factors you mentioned are much harder to measure. People lie about social distancing, and I'm not so sure the vaxed have higher preexisting immunity given that natural immunity takes away the entire medical reason to get the vaccine. As for looking at hospital admissions, I'm not sure you can compare now to a year ago so easily as weren't both countries you mentioned locked down at that point?</p>
