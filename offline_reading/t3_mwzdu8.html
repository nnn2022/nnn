    <strong>Told Club, Don't institute vaccine passports on members.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi <strong><em>*</em></strong>**,</p>
<p>Please don't institute what amounts to a "vaccine passport" on the club. These vaccines are experimental and I have had friends who had family members with seizures, tingling and nerve problems and have had to call 911 upon receiving the vaccines. There are people with health problems including autoimmune problems and history of anaphylaxis who may be making decisions not to receive experimental vaccines with such severe side effects especially since J&amp;J had blood clot problems.</p>

<p>Once the rate of infection dropped down, I would be willing to meet while socially distanced with space and masks. The levels would have to drop a bit more. Thanks so much for giving us a platform to respond as to future club involvement. </p>
<hr>
<p>This is a stamp collecting club, and I am hoping it has enough conservative members in it. [many are older and Republican] that I decided to take the risk.</p></p>

<p>I'm really not sure your point here.  It seems you don't want a private club to require vaccination but you do want them to enforce distancing and masks?   So don't impose your restrictions but impose mine?  Or are you just throwing this out as a compromise?</p>
<p>&rt;  I decided to take the risk.</p>
<p>What risk do you feel you were taking?  Being ostracized by a group of philatelists?</p>

        <p>Threw it out as a compromise. I still wear being high risk but I am lowering the usage and certainly not wearing them outside anymore. </p>
<p>LOL if I got ostracized oh well. :P I just got tired of the vaccine passport thing being touted. I mean none of these people haven't figured out the vaccine doesn't make people immune anyway?</p>

        <p>Got it.  Yeah, everyone has to do what makes them feel right.  It's when others enforce their rules on you that I get frustrated.</p>
