    <strong>Situation in Finland</strong>
    <p><p>It seems I got very lucky. My country seems to have one of the most sane policies when dealing with the pandemic.</p>
<p>Masks have not been even recommended. Health ministry conducted a meta study about masks. Since there is no scientific evidence that widespread mask usage would be very beneficial (or it might as well be harmful), it obviously was not recommended. This is not because there is not enough masks. Finland increased its own production of protection equipment too.</p>
<p>Schools were reopened after being shut down for \~8 weeks. This was because there was plenty of evidence that children only very rarely transmit the virus. There were only few virus cases in schools after reopening. However, everything went very smoothly.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions though. Restaurants have to close at 01:00 AM when normally it would be 05:00 AM. Gatherings of more than 500 people are banned until 1st of August. People are recommended not to travel to most countries abroad. However, every Finn has a constitutional right to leave Finland at will anytime.</p>
<p>There are problems common to every country in the world. Tourism and certain businesses are down. Hence, unemployment rate is rising.</p>
<p>My guess is that we will not be able to fully globally control this novel virus for a long time, if ever. Acceptance should be the next phase. There were hundreds of more or less lethal viruses, bacteria, and fungi before the year 2019. Now there is one more.</p></p>

        <p>The thing about Scandinavia is that they are very practical, down to earth people. It's not that they have more rights than we do in the US. The difference is that people here immediately get emotional, defensive and above all, we've all been conditioned to fear EVERYTHING ("see something - say something", "stay safe" instead of saying "have a good trip" it's "have a safe trip") We have ditched our freedoms and sacrificed reason at the altar of "safety"</p>

        <p>I think you are correct. The mindset is entirely different than an American mindset, which sees everything as a potential for danger and fear. </p>
<p>An America friend of mine studied abroad in Finland and could not get over how you could just leave stuff out in public and not fear people stealing it, for instance. That blew her mind. </p>
<p>The entire mindset is the complete opposite of ‚Äúfear thy neighbor‚Äù, which is what is drilled into the minds of Americans from a very early age. We are constantly set against each other and made to view our fellow citizens as potential enemies who would do us harm. </p>
<p>The issue of mask wearing is just one in a long history of issues that have been used to divide us.</p>

        <p>Sure we have the recommendation of social distancing. It is not enforced though. Maybe people tend to queue to the cashier of a grocery store with more space in between them. Hard to say. This is Finland anyway. We used to keep courtesy distance in queues even before this new phenomenon. However, the distancing was part of the school reopening routine, and the teachers did try to enforce it among the children.</p>

        <p>Yea it's not enforced here by police or anything, but there is stickers and markings everywhere, which is driving me nuts sometimes. </p>

        <p>Even though they are futile, I consider the stickers one of the tolerable features in the security theater. Obviously, they are rather ridiculous at this point.</p>
<p>And was the distancing really enforced in schools strictly? I remember seeing some news footage of schools here in Finland where children were hugging each other and they just let it happen. Can you actually control that?</p>

        <p>I don't think most teachers care to be honest. Like in schools and to some extent also high schools and universities, making sure young people keep their distance to each other is futile and ridicoulus.</p>
<p>Here they often say our strategy for dealing with coronavirus is sustainable, but it really isn't. You can't go against human nature for a long period of time.</p>

        <p>That is the latest mandated by law. The law is the same across Finland. However, many restaurants don't take this option and close earlier. In rural Finland, you might not be able to find a place open that late at night.</p>
