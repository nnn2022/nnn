    <strong>Dr. Derek Knauss</strong>
    <p><p>A while back, a video surfaced of a man named Patrick Gunnels was passed off as being Dr. Derek Knauss. Apparently, the video is of Gunnels reading statements from one Dr. Derek Knauss about the Covid-19 "virus" not existing.  My question is was the good doctors identity ever verified? I have been searching for hours and cannot confirm his existence. I did however find Gunnels YouTube and Gab accounts. I apologize if this topic has already been covered. I just found this sub and I like what I'm seeing so far.</p></p>

        <p>I don't know about Dr Derek knauss but I have seen Dr Andrew Kaufmann being interviewed twice and he said the same thing. https://youtu.be/x5impD0_3nw
He's highly qualified in virology and he's not the only one saying this either. In this link h covers Kochs postulates.</p>

        <p>The statement you are referring to was originally attributed to a Dr. Robert Oswald in December 2020. There was nothing specifically stating that Dr. Robert Oswald had said it, but his picture was included next to it. </p>
<p>Dr. Oswald subsequently released a statement saying that the claim had nothing to do with him. </p>
<p>In January 2021, somebody took the exact same quote and claimed that a Dr. Derek Knauss said it. </p>
<p>Dr. Knauss has never been identified and the entire statement appears to be a hoax given its history.</p>

        <p>I suspected as much. I searched for hours online and was never able to verify his existence. The information I've been looking for is definitive proof that sars covid 2 was ever actually isolated and that's when I came across that video. I admit, I've been living under a rock for months now and am way behind on the most current information.</p>
