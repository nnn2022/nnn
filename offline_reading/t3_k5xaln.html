    <strong>Africa, Tetanus vaccines, HCG and "anti-fertility vaccines"</strong>
    <p><p>WARNING: this is not a Bill Gates Conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>We all know several people have talked about vaccines that sterilize women in poor countries without their consent. Here is an article (it is very long and well researched and very informative with many sources and citations. It follows the WHO and this vaccine from 1976 until at least 2014.) talking about HCG in a Tetanus vaccine given in Africa. The HCG caused infertility for an undetermined time period. The women were not informed they were being given an "anti-fertility vaccine". </p>
<p>If you have time, this is very worth a read. Again, it is a verrrry long article. I think they do these things in 3rd world countries because most people won't notice or have any way of finding out what they have been injected with. Also, note that the WHO, instead of just proving this wasn't true after being accused of it in Mexico and the Phillipines, refused to provide a sample of the vaccine for analysis and suspended their efforts to continue pushing the vaccine in Kenya in 1995. They began their campaign in Kenya again in 2013 and when the Kenyan Catholic Doctors association questioned the vaccine, the WHO said their fears were "unfounded" and that the vaccine was "safe". Of course, once the Catholic doctors got ahold of the vaccines (multi-shot vaccine) they tested it and found HCG which was making women infertile. </p>

        <p>Saved. This will be important in future.</p>
<p>Edit: I wonder if the coronavirus-mRNA-vaccine ~~will~~ could encode for a fragment of Hcg and make it a longer term infertility without boosters?</p>

        <p>I have no idea and wasn't trying to correlate the two. Just trying to show that the WHO, among other entities has a history of deception surrounding vaccines and what is in them and their effects on people. I think it is important to see patterns over time. Especially those patterns that indicate deception over a long time period involving worldwide organizations.</p>
