    <strong>Some Genuine Questions</strong>
    <p><p>Full disclosure: I'm not on board at all with anything this sub's content pushes for, and I have many many thoughts on the matter that I won't put in main post here. I have just a few things that I'm interested in y'all's opinions on here, though, and I'm happy to answer any questions or you have for me or why I'm asking what I am in return. Feel free to answer as many or as few of these as you like, I'm coming out of morbid curiosity and nothing else. 100% cordiality guarantee. </p>
<p>1) What age/gen/demographic/educational background do you belong to? </p>
<p>2) Do you believe that COVID is real? If so, do you believe that it evolved naturally, or do you believe it was human-made/intentional?</p>
<p>3) Do you subscribe to the notion that herd immunity is critical to prevent alternative strains of COVID from evolving? </p>
<p>4) Do you believe it is your responsibility to look out for those who cannot become vaccinated for medical reasons (allergy, autoimmune disease)? If you, theoretically, knew without a doubt that your vaccine avoidance would lead to somebody getting COVID, would you be more inclined to become vaccinated? Would your answer change if that person were medically unable to become vaccinated themselves? Would your answer change if they died? </p>
<p>5) Elsewhere, this subreddit has a reputation for peddling conspiracies. Does this concern you? Do you think your beliefs on COVID make you more likely to believe in other coverups and conspiracies? Do you think any of your previous thoughts on other coverups or conspiracies made you more inclined to believe what you do about COVID? </p>
<p>6) I am fully vaccinated, but I've noticed that I choose to wear a mask in public in part because I don't want people to think that I'm a Republican. For the right-leaners or wingers reading this, do you feel the same pressure in the opposite direction? Do you feel any social pressure to <em>not</em> wear a mask out of fear of being cast as a Democrat?</p>
<p>That's all! Sorry if any of those questions came across as robotic, I'm just trying not to mince words because I know that can be annoying.</p></p>

<p>We knew that before your first sentence.  Every masker, vaxxer, and pro-lockdown fiend seems to create a post at some point or another with some variation of the title "I have a genuine question..". For some reason "genuine" is the word of choice.  Probably because y'all know you're not being genuine at all.</p>

        <p>A bunch of loaded questions here. This is a very anti-intellectual approach. You use the word “believe” often which is a projection of how you approach all of this. We prefer facts and skeptical inquiry here which is the foundation of the scientific spirit.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You need a box to put me in so you can ignore the content of my mind. This is the classic social justice approach to humanity and ideas. You Judge me first by the color of my skin, sex, etc. so you better “know” why I believe what I do. It’s pure bigotry wrapped up in academic garb.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Virology 101 tells us that as they spread they mutate and become less dangerous. Zero evidence, despite media fear mongering, to suggest that the case is any different with covid. In this regard, building herd immunity through natural infection is a desire-able outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t engage in fantasy, conjecture or “belief”. The vulnerable have nothing to fear from me. as an atheist it blows my mind at how fervent many on the progressive left have become in their “beliefs” in the absence of fact around COVID. Though unsurprising in the sense that that type of collectivism would lead towards religious values. It’s just another form of brutal tribalism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No. I love a vibrant and bountiful marketplace of ideas. If reddit and the internet as a whole are not a tool for that than they’re a tool for something else—what?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brother, you’re peeking through holes in a prison wall you made in your own mind. Try the door. It’s unlocked. 
I haven’t worn a mask in a few months now for all non-income based activities. Because facts and evidence, dignity and self-respect motivate me, I don’t care what others think of me. It’s as simple as that.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply! </p>
<p>&rt;A bunch of loaded questions here. This is a very anti-intellectual approach. You use the word “believe” often which is a projection of how you approach all of this.</p>
<p>Maybe I could have phrased it differently, but since I'm asking about beliefs here I think this is relatively okay. They're more-or-less social questions, at least IMO. </p>
<p>&rt;You need a box to put me in so you can ignore the content of my mind. This is the classic social justice approach to humanity and ideas. You Judge me first by the color of my skin, sex, etc. so you better “know” why I believe what I do. It’s pure bigotry wrapped up in academic garb.</p>
<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>&rt;Real. Probably man-made. </p>
<p>Do you think it was man-made for like, control reasons? Do you suspect it was a private affair or a government doing it? </p>
<p>&rt;Virology 101 tells us that as they spread they mutate and become less dangerous. Zero evidence, despite media fear mongering, to suggest that the case is any different with covid. In this regard, building herd immunity through natural infection is a desire-able outcome.</p>
<p>I don't know what the nice way to say that your first sentence is untrue is, so I'll just say that that is neither the scientific consensus that I learned in VIR nor the consensus that I could find online after I read your comment. As for a follow-up: is there any reason, in your mind, for herd immunity through infection to be preferable to herd immunity through vaccination?</p>
<p>&rt;I don’t engage in fantasy, conjecture or “belief”. The vulnerable have nothing to fear from me. as an atheist it blows my mind at how fervent many on the progressive left have become in their “beliefs” in the absence of fact around COVID. Though unsurprising in the sense that that type of collectivism would lead towards religious values. It’s just another form of brutal tribalism.</p>
<p>Not sure I have much to add here, but I am curious if you, as an atheist, feel kinship towards the right--which is more religious now than it ever has been before. Also, do you see the same collectivist/groupthink problems in this community as you do on the left? My understanding is that every group engages in groupthink, but the degree varies. Not sure if you'd agree with that statement or not, but I suspect you might. </p>
<p>&rt;No. I love a vibrant and bountiful marketplace of ideas. If reddit and the internet as a whole are not a tool for that than they’re a tool for something else—what?</p>
<p>Hm... I see what you're saying. I think, though, that if you've got this self-image (which could very well be true, I don't mean this judgementally) as a fact-first, scientific type, then do you not take issue with conspiracies that can't be proven in any way? Do you shirk the unprovable ones and entertain ones that you see evidence for? </p>
<p>&rt;Brother, you’re peeking through holes in a prison wall you made in your own mind. Try the door. It’s unlocked. I haven’t worn a mask in a few months now for all non-income based activities.

        <p>Obvious bait is obvious but I'll bite because I'm bored.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I believe something came out of China. I don't think it's that much different than the flu though (coronavirus is the common cold after all) and the majority (if not all) of flu cases this past year have been rebranded as Covid cases. I believe it was human-made. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, but herd immunity is achieved through a combination of vaccination and infection. So no forced vaccines or any of that shit.</p>
</li>
<li>

        <p>Yo thanks for answering! Promise it's not bait, I'm bored just like you. </p>
<p>&rt;I believe something came out of China. I don't think it's that much different than the flu though (coronavirus is the common cold after all) and the majority (if not all) of flu cases this past year have been rebranded as Covid cases. I believe it was human-made.</p>
<p>Can you expand on the common cold part? I heard this IRL from a member of my girlfriend's family recently, but I don't understand the evidence or context that's being used. Also, 20% more people died (from all causes) in 2020 than in 2019, is that not evidence that this was a very bad virus? Almost nobody dies from a cold (or, comparatively, the modern flu).</p>
<p>&rt;Yes, but herd immunity is achieved through a combination of vaccination and infection. So no forced vaccines or any of that shit.</p>
<p>Interesting angle, one of the things I've learned quickly in this thread is that there's a definite affinity for immunity through infection vs vaccine. </p>
<p>&rt;No. They could die from anything. My life and life in general should not have to change to accomodate a very minute group of people. Also, they can stay home if they're that scared (like we have done for the past year now), we're technologically advanced enough so that they can live quite comfortably from their own homes. If this wasn't the case none of this lockdown shit would have flown the past year.</p>
<p>I would argue that this is fundamentally easy moral decision, though; yes, perhaps the chances are low of me killing someone, and yes, they could probably live like a hermit for the rest of their lives (or at least until the virus is eradicated), but I incur very little downside from just immunizing myself. </p>
<p>&rt;Most if not all of our conspiracies have come true, so no, it doesn't concern me that people call us conspiracy theorists. I've never seen anything too outlandish posted on here (Earth is flat, royal family are lizard people etc.), and as I said stuff like vaccine passports and microchips have been revealed to be true now.</p>
<p>I'd be interested in what conspiracies you guys have had that you think have come true, I've been lurking for a couple months now (again, harmless, I just find it interesting) and I see lots of people claiming that certain things have come true while fundamentally having not connected the dots on those things or misconstruing news. Also, I don't think you can compare a subdermal implant the size of a fingernail to a microscopic chip that would have to fit into a needle. Plus, if the whole point of the vaccine was to microchip me, why did I need two doses? Was the virus just a means of needing everyone to get vaccinated as a vehicle for the microchip? If so, why not just put it in the common flu vaccine? </p>
<p>&rt;Then you don't follow The Science do you? It IS all about politics. I don't give a flying fuck about politics and I actually think society's obsession with it is a fucking cancer but I wouldn't care either way if people thought I was a Democrat or a Republican/Labour or Conservative. I think if you do you're kind of pathetic honestly.</p>
<p>I suppose. I followed the science for safety's sake when I was vulnerable and actively capable of transmitting it to others, and now that I'm immunized most of COVID's impact on me is social, so I'm just following those queues. Kinda surprised that pathetic is the worst I've been called in this thread so far, so I'll take it haha. </p>
<p>Thanks for the reply man!</p>

        <p>You're welcome.</p>
<p>&rt;Can you expand on the common cold part? I heard this IRL from a memberof my girlfriend's family recently, but I don't understand the evidenceor context that's being used. Also, 20% more people died (from allcauses) in 2020 than in 2019, is that not evidence that this was a verybad virus? Almost nobody dies from a cold (or, comparatively, the modernflu).</p>
<p>From coronavirus on wikipedia: In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the <strong>common cold</strong> (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.</p>
<p>Going off that and from everything I've witnessed this past year, the way I see it it's a slightly more lethal version of the flu. There's been plenty cases of overreporting on the number of deaths from Covid (most of which had at least FOUR comorbidities) and the survival rate is around 99.9% for a large percentage of the population. I just think the reaction to it has been overblown and far more damaging than it needed to be.</p>
<p>I'd like to see those figures (the 20% more people dying), I wasn't aware that all the deaths had been tallied up for the past year?</p>
<p>&rt;I would argue that this is fundamentally easy moral decision, though;yes, perhaps the chances are low of me killing someone, and yes, theycould probably live like a hermit for the rest of their lives (or atleast until the virus is eradicated), but I incur very little downsidefrom just immunizing myself.</p>
<p>Go to the CovidVaccinated subreddit. There's plenty of downsides. I find it highly suspicious that a lot of these deaths and side effects are being outright censored or ignored by the media. I've begrudgingly abided by most of the rules and given up a year of my life at this point: ENOUGH. I am not willing to risk myself or be coerced/blackmailed with the witholding of my freedom any longer. We are giving these people far too much power. What's to stop them from doing it again? Also, it'll never be enough for the doomers. It won't just be two vaccines and done; there will be booster shots.</p>
<p>&rt;I'd be interested in what conspiracies you guys have had that you thinkhave come true, I've been lurking for a couple months now (again,harmless, I just find it interesting) and I see lots of people claimingthat certain things have come true while fundamentally having notconnected the dots on those things or misconstruing news. Also, I don'tthink you can compare a subdermal implant the size of a fingernail to amicroscopic chip that would have to fit into a needle.

If so, why not just put it in the commonflu vaccine?</p>
<p>Like I said, vaccine passports. That was theorized right from the beginning (or close enough). A lot of people said "two weeks to flatten the curve" would not be two weeks. The "microchip in the vaccine" thing is a strawman as far as I can tell. Never seen anyone say it would be in the vaccine; just that the vaccine might lead to a situation where a microchip implant becomes a viable thing that people wouldn't protest against having too much.</p>
<p>"Was the virus just a means of needing everyone to get vaccinated as a vehicle for the microchip?" That seems to be the prevailing theory.</p>

<li>The really out there conspiracy stuff that you see was posted by trolls trying to discredit us or idiots dumb enough to believe the trolls. If you look deeper than the title, you will see responses calling out these posts as junk. The rest isn't theory anymore and labeling it as such was a purely political tactic. There were plenty of articles calling the idea of vaccine passports conspiracy theories until they actually started implementing them.</li>

        <p>I've seen plenty of astroturfy bullshit in my time online, so I definitely understand that it can be frustrating to see people post extreme shit to discredit you. On the other hand, though, posts like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/neljkd/things_that_make_you_go_hmmmm/">this one from today</a> are <em>pretty</em> far out there and have no contractors (that I could find) in the comments. </p>
<p>Also, you might be a good person to ask about vaccine passports. So, I've seen a few people now mention that they, as a conspiracy, were "confirmed'; I'm wondering, though, why you guys think they count as a conspiracy. That is to say that, for example, my dad 11 months ago bought the website for an app that he never developed that was about verifying COVID immunity--it seems like a logical step to me that society would be looking for other ways to verify immunity in lots of scenarios. What makes the passport angle special?</p>

        <p>Very liberal Democrat here.  Lived in France for 8 years.  Wish we had more of a socialist society in US, healthcare for all, housing for all, more political parties represented in gov, etc.  when big pharma is making money from the vaccine, I question the transparency they bring to the table.  Scientific method says to question everything.  I am reading studies, articles from around the world and forming my own opinions about the vaccine.  I don’t ever rush to judgment, but leave things open for as long as possible.  The pressure being put on society to take the vaccine and labeling people anti vaxers if they are studying it first, is just wrong.  I know two people who have  been injured after the shot.  A friend had a blood clot and a stroke within 12 hours of first dose and another friends stepmom died within two days of her shot.  I want to honor their lives and wish the media reported each injury or death so that we could do that as a society, but people are afraid to talk about this as they are labeled for doing so.  I myself am afraid to speak up in my circle of friends and work as questioning the main stream narrative is highly discouraged.  Don’t put people in boxes and assume things about their thinking on this.  They might have done more research than you have or had first hand experiences that have informed their choices.  As to your question about c theories, I like reading conspiracy theories, haven’t noticed too many on here though.  If you have a critical mind it’s pretty obvious what is real or fake, but you can always learn something from thinking for yourself.  Censorship is the opposite of a free society.  More research, more debate, more respect for different choices or opinions are my answers to your seemingly biased and one sided questions.</p>

<li>My age doesn't matter, I've always been smart about the government and their pro-death agendas. A quick perusal through any 20th Century History book will clue you into that.</li>
<li>There is definitely a sickness going around. I had it and it smoked me. That doesn't matter. People have been getting sick since I've been alive. I don't agree with one modification of our freedoms regardless of the fact that I had it and know it's an ass kicker.

<li>I don't care about herd immunity because this isn't a virus.</li>
<li>I DEFINITELY don't believe that my or your freedoms should ever be discussed as a mitigation strategy to any sickness. More freedom is always a better solution than less freedom, regardless of the problem. Why? Because guaranteed freedom is even more important than life. Without freedom, what's the point of life even if you're safe? As a free American, I am not compelled to ever have a responsibility for your health, nor do I even have to care. This same freedom could liberate all the Covid worshippers too if they so desired. They could form their own community of paranoid hypochondriacs and live happily ever after somewhere, scared as hell and suspicious of everything. Wouldn't bother me a bit. </li>
<li>There are no more conspiracies. They have all come true.</li>
<li>I don't wear a mask in protest of government overreach regarding this sickness. Oh, and because Fauci told us in March 2020, in perhaps his only honest moment in this whole thing, that they absolutely don't work. Then I read the box the masks come in and it told me they don't work either. This isn't political, it's common sense.</li>

<p>Your answers here are super interesting; why don't you think it's a virus? You said there's "definitely a sickness", why couldn't that be a virus? </p>
<p>&rt;I DEFINITELY don't believe that my or your freedoms should ever be discussed as a mitigation strategy to any sickness. </p>
<p>This may be more of a philosophical/political question, but what about negative freedoms? Doesn't your freedom to own a gun end where my freedom to not get shot begins? </p>
<p>Thanks for the answer!</p>

        <p>Thanks for listening. The pen is mightier than the sword. I believe that.</p>
<p>I believe it's not a virus because of the transmission pathology I have seen with my own eyes. If it's so deadly and infectious, then what I have seen does not make sense. I am leaning more to radiation sickness, which the symptoms of that match Covid near perfect, but I'm also open to targeted toxicity, although I have no idea how one might go about that.</p>
<p>Of course you have the right to not get shot. If I did so without provocation, then I would be liable for the infringement of your freedoms and would have to pay whatever penalty was appropriate.</p>
<p>There is always a matching responsibility to an inherent human right. However, I do not have the responsibility for your safety any more than you have the right to proclaim that I do or should. </p>
<p>The problem with maskers and doomers is that they are promoting the idea that by simply being unmasked I am infringing on their rights when this can not be proven legally. Unlike, if I T bone you on the roadway, whereby the blame is legally attributable. But imagine if I merely passed you in the opposite lane 2 blocks before someone T-boned you and you tried to blame my passing on your accident. No matter how much you might believe that, and maybe with good reason, proving it would be very difficult.<br>
So, sense Doomers can't prove someone has made them sick legally, just wear your mask and be happy with that. After all, it's YOUR personal protection, not mine.</p>

        <p>Could you tell me about the transmission pathology you’ve seen with your own eyes? In my opinion the rate of spread &amp; lethality match up perfectly to a really really bad airborne pathogen.</p>
<p>I also want to push back gently against the idea that it is okay to not wear a mask or get vaccinated because fault for COVID deaths can’t be proven legally. That is completely true, but mask-wearing is primarily a moral problem, not a legal one. Just because nobody can ever hold you liable for getting others sick, that doesn’t mean that you’re <em>not</em> infringing on their safety by getting them sick, it just means your actions won’t have consequences. This is an extreme comparison, but I would say that a really well-trained, uncatchable assassin is still doing a moral wrong by assassinating people, even if she’s completely capable of evading the law with ease.</p>

        <p>&rt;If I was to be apprehensive about all the ways I might hurt people, I would never drive.</p>
<p>Sure! I mean I'm with you on this, but I think that the difference in yours and my thinking then <em>has</em> to just come down to how inconvenient we think getting a vaccine is, right? Not driving a car is <em>super</em> inconvenient, especially in America--you'd have to literally restructure your whole life around that type of thing. Getting 2 doses of a vaccine cost me about 2 total hours of my life, though, and has now rendered me safe and psychologically unburdened. </p>
<p>&rt;As for pathology, I've not witnessed mass infection. I've seen one off infections even when a whole group of people were "exposed" to the person in every intimate way possible. And this has been true for all sizes of groups. If this viral transmission is rapid and super infectious, I've not seen that at all.</p>
<p>Not to get too weeds-y but COVID has a really long incubation time (usually about 2 weeks) in comparison to cold or flu (a couple days), do you think that could be a reason that you didn't see it as a highly infectious disease in your experience? </p>
<p>&rt;I also have hundreds of elderly customers, with every co-morbidity known to man. They are all fine and have been fine, as have all their neighbors.</p>
<p>That's perfectly possible, but I'd say unlikely. About 75 million americans have caught COVID at some point (one in four-ish), and a majority of elderly individuals demonstrate some symptoms, even if they don't die from it. Here's maybe an interesting question: do you think that you could be ignoring larger scientific consensus because your anecdotal experience doesn't match it? Alternatively, do you think you might be ignoring customers staying home with symptoms or going to the doctor because it doesn't fit your current worldview? </p>
<p>&rt;I did, however, lose my first customer to the vaccine this week.</p>
<p>Whoa, are you saying they died? Or just like a metaphorical "loss"? I'm interested in how you expand on this, if you don't mind. If it's a metaphorical loss, why do you view someone getting the vaccine as a negative?</p>

        <p>&rt;<strong>Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.</p>
