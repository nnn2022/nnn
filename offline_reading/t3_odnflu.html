    <strong>Has anyone noticed how excited Doomers are, whenever there's a new variant mentioned</strong>
    <p><p>Sure, they will say shit like "oh this is horrible" or "we all want it to be over but (insert excuse)", but actions speak louder than words.</p>
<p>Notice whenever there's good news on the main coronavirus subreddit or even on the local subreddits like coronavirusUK, there's always that one idiot comment down below saying "wait till the delta/brazilian/UK variant starts saying hello" or some shit like that, and then when there's no problem after all, its radio silence from them until the next variant, rinse and repeat, as if they actually enjoy it. Usually happens on the posts when it says "restrictions will be removed on (insert date here)". They hype it up like a new Marvel villain arriving. it was actually worse in 2020, but nowadays those comments thankfully keep getting downvoted from what I've noticed.</p>
<p>So... what's that? They want people to get sick? Absolute fucking psychopaths</p></p>

        <p>Covidian cultists lib clowns are actually insane. It is now their personality and only meaning in life, it is what drives them to virtue signal and pretend like they are a hero and morally superior. There is no individual thought,  critical or reasonable thinking whatsoever. Goofs have zero common sense and they are just NPC bots. Bootlicking is their only purpose.</p>

        <p>Yes, and especially amongst those collecting Covid19-related 'emergency' benefits, up to $2000 a month.</p>
<p>They love this, as it means they might be able to continue to collect this $$ a bit longer, so it actually pays to pretend fearfulness and concern.</p>
<p>What other freedom-hating , self-entitled virtue signaler wouldn't love to continue to get paid while showing 'how much they care about their community'?</p>
<p>Watch them moan and baby-bird for more $$ and extensions in Canada, as Canada means to lower those same benefits.. the claims of bankruptcy, the claims of starvation, the claims of homelessness.. all a bluff to keep that sweet $$$ coming in.</p>
<p>Once the benefits end, the Mask will end too.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Please note: In Canada in general, it pays to be the oppressed, the victim, the downtrodden. It pays not only in sweet $$$, but power and the use of authority against those who would claim you are NOT oppressed, a victim or downtrodden.</p>
<p>Covid19 only AMPLIFIED this pathetic attitude, and enabled them to be paid for wearing The Mask, and to fight for lockdowns and restrictions.</p>

        <p>The reality is that mass lockdowns and shutdowns of  Pubs,Bars and Clubs suit people who already had a non existent social life or sadly have social anxiety and so on so they are always the ones saying " omg second wave" or " omg this variant is serious" because the lockdowns basically put everyone on the same page socially because there is not shit to do. I will admit at the start of the pandemic I was like this because I was in a bad place mentally but now I've improved slightly and I really can't deal with lockdowns anymore. Things are actually getting better and vaccines work but as you said your still gonna get people that just eat up every fucking article or news headline about delta plus plus 5000 and so on.</p>

        <p>I've also noticed that anxious people are more likely to freak out and unquestioningly believe COVID propaganda, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>It's not really COVID they're scared of. They're scared of everything, COVID is just a socially acceptable outlet for their fear.</p>

        <p>Yes. I have been saying it all along. There are these large number of "doomers" who are essentially losers who enjoy the entire world coming up to their levels. That's why they push for UBI and lockedowns, so people who want to grow in their lives gets stuck at these losers level.</p>
<p>This is Marxism at play here, dragging down everyone. Another one is climate change. The objective of these jokers and their useful idiot followers is to de industrialize the society, not saving the world. They masquerade their lies with objectively good statements like "this for planet earth" or "this is for your health".</p>

        <p>Yes, acting like they are conserned when the situation supposedly gets worse but in reality they enjoy it and can't hide their excitement properly. Maybe they feel that it validates their opinion, I don't know, but I noticed this behaviour already over a year ago. They don't want this shit to end.</p>
