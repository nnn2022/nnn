        <p>I wanted to take the time to break down this article as well. Piece by piece. I'm by no means a statistician or virologist. I'm just someone with a basic medical background that has taken care of severe COVID cases in an ICU, and that had to take plenty of chemistry and statistics classes for a degree. This is a layperson breaking this down. But reading it carefully one can see that it is <em>textbook</em> propaganda and fearmongering. This is how they manipulate people.</p>
<p>\&rt;With statewide COVID-19 cases surging to levels not seen since January, the town of Palm Beach announced Monday that it would require people to wear facial coverings and practice social distancing while indoors on town property — regardless of vaccination status — and called an emergency Town Council meeting for Tuesday.</p>
<p>We all know the "surge" is miniscule compared to last fall. Of course they won't lead with those numbers, they want to open by scaring you.</p>
<p>\&rt;Masks will be provided to visitors who may be unaware of the new policy, Town Manager Kirk Blouin said.</p>
<p>They're phrasing it like its a friendly reminder because I doubt they want to get slapped by the Governor on this.</p>
<p>\&rt;The policy will remain in effect until the town deems it safe to relax mitigation efforts, the town said. Law enforcement has been authorized to issue trespass warnings and remove any individuals not in compliance with the policy.</p>
<p>Funny how we went from trusting science to just accepting the word of one municipal government when it comes to personal liberty. </p>
<p>\&rt;During the past several weeks, the highly contagious Delta variant has fueled an exponential rise in infections and <strong>hospitalizations</strong> throughout the state, according to data released by the Florida Department of Health. In its weekly report issued late Friday, the state noted an increase of 73,199 new coronavirus infections, which was nearly double the number of cases that were reported the previous week.</p>
<p>What are the hospitalization numbers? Cases don't matter, and if they were tested with the PCR test then we can't trust those numbers anyway.</p>
<p>\&rt;The new cases represented the biggest one-week surge since Jan. 27, and were more than California, Texas, New York and Illinois combined.</p>
<p>Clearly an attempt to paint Florida in a bad light, but none of those states have mask mandates in place right now either. Gotta get the political pokes in while you can.</p>
<p>\&rt;Positivity rates also continue to climb, according to the state report, with the state jumping from an 11.5% percent positivity rate during the previous week to 15.1%. Palm Beach County's positivity rate rose from 9.6% to 12.5%. </p>
<p>Another worthless stat made to sound scary. If you have 0 cases one week and 1 case the next, that's a 100% increase in cases. Are those LIFETIME cases or week by week, adjusted for positives? Are they counting the entire county population each time or adjusting for people that have had COVID and recovered and have natural immunity? </p>
<p>\&rt;Council President Maggie Zeidman said the surge in new coronavirus cases is being driven by those who remain unvaccinated, and the town took that into consideration when imposing new restrictions. Though 100% of residents ages 16 and older on the island are vaccinated, according to the county health department, there are some town staff and visitors who are not, Zeidman said, and that has been a cause for concern.</p>
<p>So I guess that whole "91% Effective" number from Pfeizer was a lie then. If it isn't transmittable among county residents, why not just require visitors to wear masks then? </p>
<p>\&rt;Zeidman also expressed concern about the rising number of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people, and the lack of available data on how prevalent those infections are.</p>
<p>Without access to that data, she said, people need to put their masks back on.</p>
<p>That number was supposed to be 90-something percent effective for both Pfeizer and Moderna. <em>Why aren't they trusting the SCIENCE!?</em> Are you suggesting Big Pharma LIED about the effectiveness of a brand new vaccine using brand new technology that the governments of the world were going to pay them billions of dollars for? Phooey! </p>
<p>\&rt;"People who are vaccinated can be infected with the coronavirus, particularly with the Delta variant," she said. "The viral load with the Delta variant is much higher. That means that everybody is susceptible. People who are vaccinated now need to mask up, so everybody has to wear a mask."</p>
<p>A junk statement. A complete crock of shit. High viral loads have been found in people with no symptoms that tested positive for COVID. Relatively low loads have been found in intubated severe cases. A higher viral load with Delta variant patients, common sense would dictate, would mean MORE of the virus was required to make someone sick, making Delta less serious than the original infection. Either way it has no bearing on public health because its still COVID, it STILL has a spike protein, and the vaccine still works.</p>
<p>This is fear. Its all it is. Its a perfect microcosm of how the media has exacerbated this crisis since it kicked off. Its textbook journalistic malpractice.</p>
