        <p>&rt;Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'</p>
<p>&rt;Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered.  From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities.</p>

        <p>Since the CCP vehemently insists that it did NOT start in their virology institute and there were more than questionable "inquiries" from the WHO that left people just as clueless as before I think there's no reason not to believe that this is a real virus.</p>
<p>It's the way how it's framed and abused for instilling fear in people by having lots of conflicting information out there so that nobody knows what's right and wrong anymore, that's what the problem is.</p>
<p>In regards to the question: Yeah it's real. But it is nowhere even near the potency that would, even remotely, justify mask mandates, lockdowns or any other measure, neither does it justify ignoring and violating basic human rights.</p>
<p>The reason why people stick with the "omg you just don't care, do you?" shtick is because it gives them something to hold on to, a moral compass if you will. Since religion has been on the decline for decades and people subscribed to fads that just went away over time, this is something to believe in, though this time, because it plays so heavily on emotions and a topic that is hard to grasp for many, it has a much bigger effect. Then you have charismatic people telling you that they are an expert and the broad public believes it despite having no way of confirming anything that is being said other than by "I am afraid, whatever it takes to make me and others safe.".</p>
<p>Can't blame the doomers too much tbh. The desire for safety is deeply entrenched in human nature. Making sense of it or understanding that this has never been guaranteed or that the same people who stand in front of cameras might not have this safety on their mind is a whole different pair of shoes.</p>
<p>Belief plays a big role. Just like we believe our side, the doomers believe theirs. Though I'd say our side has more attachment to reality since we haven't dropped like flies yet and it seems like the doomer graphs and statistics just never seem to represent what is actually going on, but only a small piece of the big picture. Like <a href="https://i.imgflip.com/3ripe6.jpg">this meme</a> here. Ultimately, when it comes to the scientific stuff, I'd argue that almost nobody has any capacity of double-checking any claim made (Edit: By that I don't mean reading up research online. Even when peer-reviewed, I wouldn't be able to replicate a study to verify it for myself. That's the type of "double-checking" that I mean. You need to take things with a grain of salt.), be it for or against the measures, outside of what they see from their own subjective perception.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the sheer scale on which all of this plays out is extremely intriguing and interesting. Like, bruh, imagine keeping millions of people in a perpetual state of hysteria and fear so that common sense gets completely thrown over board, and it doesn't even matter what you fear or are hysterical about since it stuns you either way. The fact that this is even possible is insane.</p>

        <p>Let me copy&amp;paste this answer I gave yesterday to a similar question:</p>
<p>I suppose that this would depend on how we define the terms "believe", "covid-19" and "real".</p>
<p>I'd  say that reality is the physical world surrounding us, which exists  independently from our perception and perspective before we "filter" it  through our senses and the processing of our brain.</p>
<p>I think that our perception of reality is just an reflection or a model of reality and as such determined to be flawed.</p>
<p>I think we can get this internal model of reality closer to reality by increasing the amount of perspectives that we look at it.</p>
<p>I'd  define believing in something as assuming that the internal model of it  does not have any significant flaws and could easily be defended  against my own inquiry without getting entrapped in contradictions.</p>
<p>Now  let's have a look at how I have perceived covid-19 so far and whether the  way I've perceived it is enough for me to have formed a model of it in  my mind of which I think reflects it's actual nature that is so  accurate, that I'd feel confident to identify it, whenever I encounter  it.</p>
<p>All information I've obtained  about covid-19 so far is from external sources. It supposedly is a specific  type of ailment of the respiratory tract with varying severity. It  supposedly is caused by a specific type of virus that is labeled as  coronavirus.<br>
Furthermore I've heard that no severity at all, also  known as asymptomatic covid-case, should also be possible as long as  reproductive coronaviruses are present.<br>
So according to what I've heard, covid-19 could be with everyone and noone and anything inbetween.<br>
And  since the supposed size of supposed viruses undercuts my threshold for  visual perception, let alone identification, I have no way of personally  confirming whether a supposed asymptomatic covid-case is covid-19 or not.</p>
<p>So  all I really have is the word of other people who claim that they have  methods to detect the virus and who claim that they know the virus can  reproduce and who claim that in cases, where covid-19 is not symptom-free  but comes with an ailment of the respiratory tract, the viruses are the  cause of it.</p>
<p>According to my definition of what is necessary for me to believe in something, covid-19 fails this assessment.<br>
I take it into consideration as one of many possible theories to explain a phenomenon that I have observed.</p>
<p>The  main thing that is missing for me to believe in it would be learning  about a method that I can personally use in order to confirm the many  premises I've heard about the entity called corona-virus.</p>

        <p>It's a term that supposed to represent a set of symptoms. The problem is, it doesn't, because it covers non-symptoms too (like healthy people having covid-19, remember?). Therefore it's latin pharma-BS.</p>

        <p>Actually no...l don't believe it's real they just managed to overinflate the dangers of the common cold and the flu. l used to be a pharmacist so l never though l'd say no to a question like this but here we are. Been working in person since this started,haven't fllowed the "measures", haven't caught anything. So where is it??</p>

        <p>It's all just a mutation of a cold virus that mutates probably every day, if they keep looking for it they will find an infinite number of new variants. covid-19 at most is a single mutation of it and is otherwise a cover up for anyone getting with the the presence of viruses in them. The tests could be picking up anything and are irrelevant anyways even if they did because if you are sick with a corona virus you will know it since there is no asymptomatic spread. Before this year no one ever got tested anyways and only based on symptoms called what they had a cold or if very bad a flu. The rebranding of the "flu" is now being labeled as covid-19 too. I'm not even going to get into why I think germ theory isn't even valid based on my own observations. But it is almost entirely a hoax save for the existence of something that is in fact a corona virus and it's basic outlines of symptoms its presence can cause.</p>
