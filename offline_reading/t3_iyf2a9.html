    <strong>Regarding the “2020 is so bad”-meme</strong>
    <p><p>Well our position is terrible, no doubt, but what annoys me with this meme is that the year itself (isn’t/) wasn’t bad actually.</p>
<p>F.e. (at least here) the climate and weather (so far) was the best of probably the last 5 years – very mild winter, early, sunny spring, sunny summer that was still pretty mild, etc.</p>
<p>But of course that accounts to pretty much nothing because the fascist megalomaniacs further imposed insane garbage on us, forced muzzles, people were and are imprisoned in their homes, they were incited against each other, the economy was shut down and countless small stores killed and the market-share further taken by mega-corps like amazon and walmart, etc. etc.</p>
<p><strong>But nothing of this cruel insanity needed to happen</strong>, and that’s why this meme “2020 so bad” is propaganda, because it tries to paint the picture that all of this was inevitable like a worldwide earth-quake, instead of an obviously planned war against people worldwide, thinly veiled behind some made up -novel- virus.</p>
<p>TLDR: The year is indeed very terrible, but it hadn’t to be, it was all because of the crooks in power further increasing the level of enslavement.</p></p>

        <p>I'm sick of the "2020 sucks" memes. Pro-lockdowners will post it and think they are being funny and they can't even see the irony. 2020 did not have to be this bad, we did it to ourselves.</p>

        <p>We both hate the dumb meme, though</p>
<p>&rt;2020 did not have to be this bad, <strong>we did it to ourselves.</strong></p>
<p>That's victim blaming, I'm not responsible for being abused even more by the psychopathic ruling class. <strong>There is nothing, absolutely nothing I could have done to stop this.</strong></p>
<p>And even if there were something I could have done, that still wouldn't mean the one attacked were now responsible for being attacked.</p>

        <p>We was a bad choice of word. I meant "we" in a bigger sense as in - it isn't the fault of 2020 that this year sucked so much. Just how people will say that COVID has ruined the year for them - it wasn't the virus, it was the lockdown. I am not making sense but I am basically agreeing with the OP.</p>

        <p>2020 has been hell for me, from basically the beginning.</p>
<p>My pet died, got sick with a awful "flu" (coulda been COVID itself, who knows), then my grandmother died, then lockdown crap, then more disasters for me, including a mysterious tumor/cyst now popping up in my body that I'm trying to get seen and doctors are making it VERY difficult for me.</p>

        <p>I’ve hated it since it started.  From the fires in Australia or whatever , that ww3 meme bullshit that I forgot what it even was about , to the virus, comparing the Floyd protests to the purge.  It’s fuvking ridiculous.   Though 2019 had it too</p>
