    <strong>Anyone have a seven-day average BY AGE?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve seen a lot of fallacious arguments which fail to distinguish between age groups. That is to say, the arguments are phrased as “total number of [age-group]-infections out of total number of infections.” The problem with this line of reasoning is that the pandemic <em>evolves</em> over time, in any number of senses of the term. </p>
<p>A better measure for why a particular age group is or is not at risk would be based on how the pandemic looks <em>now</em>. Take the current seven-day average of infections and divide into that the seven-day average of [age-group]-infections. <em>That</em> should tell you your <em>current</em> risk, all else being equal. An even better measure would be to discriminate further by vaccinated vs. unvaccinated, masked vs. unmasked, and compare those groups. </p>
<p>But I fail to see such data being presented. Does anyone have a good site which tracks such data, or is it deliberately being obscured?</p></p>
