    <strong>The side affects of the vaccinations</strong>
    <p><p>Nothing long here I just wanted to share my opinion. I just opened the Covid vaccine subreddit for the first time and scrolled down for maybe a good 15 seconds and about every post being filtered on hot I think is about how annoying and painful or fatiguing and numbing the vaccines are and stuff like that. It doesn’t even add up like they have all these side affects and all these problems and you can STILL get the virus but the people who are complaining about it’s problems and side affects decide to continue doing whatever is said to make them safer without doing any research?</p></p>

        <p>I know right? It's very hard to understand how they can say all these horrible effects from the shot and then snap right back into their brainwashing. Like, "I've had migraines for a month straight and I can't lift a coffee cup from the shaking... and I'm getting my second shot tomorrow!" level of crazy.</p>

        <p>It is absolutely crazy. They are proud to take these vaccines which are only making them ill and do not even prevent them catching and spreading COVID. I understand it is important for the elderly to take it, but any healthy person, you would have to have rocks in your head if you wanted to jeopardise your present and future health like that. The government doesn't care about your health one bit, if they did then CBD oil would be legal worldwide.</p>

        <p>The vaccines are not safe and I will never allow that poison in my body. I would rather take my chances with COVID. Everyone I know who had it complained bitterly about the side effects.</p>

        <p>It is pure brainwashing. The vaccine is just a cover for the treated water intervention.</p>
<p>The vaccine and covid are a cover for a treated water intervention. Several of the defence departments and governments (and corporate sponsors) from around the world (USA, UK and AUS - to name a few) have been using the covid and the vaccine to cover the symptoms people are getting from their poison water. These groups are attempting to dumb the population down by adding immune-suppressing and cognitive depressants into the water system (confirmed compounds are: nipecotic acid and norquetiapine, others currently under investigation). Many people are reacting badly to this so they needed a cover for it, which came in the form of the plandemic and vaccines. The irony is there the vaccines are only saline solution and are purely a cover. The primary objective of the treated water to result in a malleable population who are apathetic and lethargic, which we see in droves now. I am currently building a website where we can upload all the leaked documents and lab result for the tests our group has been in. The best thing you can do is avoid tap water and if you can't distil it as the reactive agents don't survive the process.</p>

        <p>It’s a combination of a desperate attempt to fit in with the people they think will wield power, buyers remorse, and cognitive dissonance.</p>

        <p>Holy shit dude.. you have these side effects for 2 days. Its a sub dedicated to getting the vaccine and it has no repeat subscribers because of how absolutely irrelevant it all is 2 days after you get your vaccination. I fully expected to see this type of low iq but tbh, I still can't believe it.</p>
