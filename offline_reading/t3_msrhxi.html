        <p>Fuck these monsters - both the parents and the doctors. Giving a kid or infant a rushed experimental “vaccine” for something that has a zero percent chance of harming them should be illegal and I don’t get why it’s not.</p>

        <p>This report doesn't make a lick of sense.</p>
<p>According to the report, the 2 year old received the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination (apparently dose 2) on <em>Feb 25th</em> and died on Mar 3rd (6 days later). And was hospitalized for 17 days, implying they were already in the hospital when they received the specified dose.</p>
<p>The Pfizer vaccine isn't approved for use under 16 years old, so it wouldn't be given to a 2 year old unless they were a participant in a clinical trial. Pfizer didn't dose the first participants in their under-12 clinical trial until the <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-biontech-announce-positive-topline-results-pivotal">last week of March</a>, so the 2 year old in this report couldn't have been part of a trial.</p>
<p>So either this report is bullshit, or somehow a 2 year old was given two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, the second <em>while hospitalized</em>, before the clinical trial for that age group had even started.</p>
<p>Like, honestly, how do you make sense of all that?</p>

        <p>Also under Life Threatening? it says No even though she died. The only symptom listed is death, but she died 2 days after onset of symptoms so there must have been others. None of this makes sense.</p>

        <p>Just my 2 cents to throw in.  I've been all over VAERS for months now looking at reports.  Every, single Adverse Event that culminated in Death as the outcome says "No" for Life Threatening.  Doesn't make any sense to me, but that is how they are posted.</p>

        <p>I assume the 2.0 age. Looking through the vaers entries age fields, they are all regular numbers; this is the only decimal I’ve seen in an age field after looking at about 60 or so entries. And it’s the same numeric value as the prior field (version 2.0; 2.0). </p>
<p>It’s also likely just poor data entry on the hospitalization and dates. If I understand correctly, data entered here can come from basically anyone (there’s a wide range of writing styles, information provided, etc). My best guess is that this documents a real post-vaccine death, but I wouldn’t take anything more than that from it.</p>
<p>Edit: people are pissed (understandably so), and angry people tend to jump the gun on things.</p>

        <p>I think retracting/correcting the post is the right thing to do; it’s what I do when I find out I was incorrect about. It’s also important here when lockdown opposition has a negative reputation among many due to the media portrayal of it. </p>
<p>But what matters is the responsibility of each individual to do their own critical thinking and assessment of claims/evidence. Anyone who doesn’t do that isn’t going to be influenced by a correction or retraction because they’re not thinking in the first place - just filtering things they see for what they like. (And corrections/retractions rarely accomplish anything at all, for what it’s worth; in order to even have a chance at undoing the impact of a false headline, the retraction/correction needs to get significantly more coverage and attention than the original content did.)</p>

        <p>This atmosphere of this sub has, quite understandably, gotten angrier over time. Many people here have suffered severe harms due to lockdowns (I have not, but I care about other people), and their patience for discussion has dwindled as a result. The quality of discussion was very different earlier on; now, the sub is largely (not exclusively) used for venting. </p>

        <p>Do you think u/Razerer92 will correct or retract this post?</p>
<p>I tend to think throwing up posts like this that are so flimsy, and especially not correcting or retracting them when it's clear how flimsy they are, completely warrants a negative reputation. </p>
<p>Like, if people here actually want others to engage with them as reasonable people, they don't do themselves any favours by propagating stuff like this and not calling it out. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sympathetic to the idea of each individual being responsible to do their own critical thinking and assessment of claims/evidence, that'd be great in a perfect world. But I think the unfortunate reality is that a lot of people won't do that most of the time, and even if they try many don't have the tools / knowledge to do it adequately. Cause it's hella difficult.</p>
<p>As far as the limitations of corrections / retractions, you're spot on. the whole "A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth puts on its shoes" thing. But I still think it's imperative to go through the process, otherwise you're essentially resigning to who-gives-a-fuck-about-anything information ecosystem.</p>

        <p>I agree with your views on this. </p>
<p>&rt; Like, if people here actually want others to engage with them as reasonable people</p>
<p>Again, I agree ... with caveat that something is true or not without regard to the speaker. I could be a raving lunatic and still be completely right about X; if someone is genuinely interested in making fact-based decisions about X, they will do their research and consider the evidence even though I’m a raving lunatic and I happen to talk about X. </p>
<p>People who resort to ad hominem fallacies (ultimately what this is) aren’t generally interested in evidence based decisions; they tend to be more interested in “proving” that they are right. While you’re completely right from a practical standpoint, I think it’s important to recognize that ultimately this is pandering to stupidity: an intelligent person interested in making informed decisions would ignore the crazy speaker and go investigate X. </p>

        <p>People will eat up misinformation if it goes with their cause.</p>
<p>Everything is of shock and face value but no verifiable sources. Mostly uneducated rural sobs, not a surprise to anybody.</p>
<p>They put reactionary titles and say 'Oh no, babies dying'. Then it turns out Bob's uncle from bumfuck nowhere doctored the picture to fuel his conspiracy fantasies. That's why you check every source you read and see if it makes sense and has been peer reviewed by doctors and virologists. Lack of critical thinking is mind blowing nowadays.</p>
<p>The movie contagion pretty much got everything down to a tee.</p>

        <p>It's true and thanks. I have a lot of good friends that are educated from rural areas, but most nutjobs come from inclusive rural areas. Hard fact to swallow for sure. Look at every conspiracy rally out there, they're almost a cut and paste.</p>

        <p>Rural people typically don't get into "peaceful" protests against police brutality, loot and burn stores down, antagonize all cops for a year, then turn around and beg for those cops to lock everyone down, forcibly vaccinate them, and take their guns away. But please go on about the superiority of you enlightened city bots.</p>

<p>On a side note, my personal conception is that addiction / alcoholism is a disease <em>of</em> choice. But that’s neither here nor there, and irrelevant to vaccines.</p>

        <h3><strong>Guys, NO. Stop, read, and think critically.</strong></h3>
<p>There’s plenty of evidence of adverse effects and deaths. </p>
<p>This one, however, legitimately appears to be a typo; view this in the vaers website, which is riddled with typos, and it is rather apparent.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the rest of the entry is internally inconsistent - dates indicate death 4 days post vaccination, while lower down the entry indicates the person was hospitalized for this for 17 days. </p>
<p>At best, this is completely useless due to the inconsistencies. </p>
<p>Don’t let your desire to find evidence supporting your objections to these vaccines tempt you into accepting clearly bad data. There is already plenty of legit data that is cause for concern, and there will certainly be more.</p>

        <p>So the baby was in hospital for 17 days but given the vaccine 7 days ago? Somehow the vaccine caused this? Tragic incident and thoughts are with the family but stop twisting this into some antivaxx nonsense when it clearly has nothing to do with it</p>

        <p>I mean that isn’t true is it. The vaccine tracking system is in place to record any medical events that happen after a vaccination to try and look for correlations and events that happen more frequently after vaccination than in the normal population. This system works very well. Just look at how incredibly rare side effects of the AstraZeneca and Jansen vaccines could be spotted even when only a few cases had occurred. However, the vast, vast majority of cases on the website were not caused by the vaccine, they just happened after the vaccine. The system is there to protect people, and it does a damn good job.</p>
