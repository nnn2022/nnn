    <strong>What the experimental procedure is all about...</strong>
    <p><p>This is war on poor people. If they claim the experimental procedure is safe and effective, then people should be compensated if they suffer from the supposedly "rare" adverse effects (each day, more are getting them); especially when it's being pushed with tactics like shaming, passports, restriction of rights and freedoms, etc. </p>
<p>BUT, everyone is liability exempt except for the person taking the procedure (which means they DON'T KNOW that it is that safe and effective, namely in the middle and long-term), so how it is fair for the person that has financial struggles to take this, and to find himself incapacitated and unable to work? And then become hopelessly dependent on the government?</p></p>
