    <strong>Trying to summon someone from UK! Need some advice:)</strong>
    <p><p>Hello! So basically I am 22yo from Lithuania, and here it's just as bad as UK just we didn't get to the point of introducing vax pass. Well actually we're even more restricted here ngl. So anyway, I am student in Manchester uni and been wanting to go back live my independent life to UK (lived there before but when shit went down gone back home). And now in May I consider of giving a try to return to UK and try to adapt myself so I could live my life independently like I did before.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I've seen tons of people commenting and saying that they're actually fleeing UK and it's really shit show there rn and it does make me wonder if I should. I mean worst case I will just return to my motherland, but is it even worth giving a shot?  Give me your honest opinion, help ur fellow tin foil hat out. (I have just few friends there, so I'd be solely depended on myself)</p></p>

        <p>I'm not from UK.  A cursory internet search revealed the following article: <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/15/uk-twin-pandemic-and-brexit-crises-prompt-unprecedented-exodus">unprecedented exodus: why are migrant workers leaving UK?</a>  Article laments that up to 1.3 million people have left UK.</p>
<p>UK will likely introduce vaccine passports.  Not sure how happy people are out there.  You don't want to go from bad to worse.  You may be better off staying in Lithuania until this crap is over.  </p>
<p>Just my two cents.</p>

        <p>I'm not from the UK but I am an immigrant in Canada. Can honestly say that this whole lockdown/pandemic crap would have been so much easier to deal with in a familiar environment with family and friends. I wish I could leave to go to my home land while Canada decides what the fuck they're doing. I would feel safer where I'm completely accepted.</p>
