    <strong>So... My aunt had a stroke recently...And this is what the paramedics asked</strong>
    <p><p>My aunt is on her 60's and had a stroke recently due to high levels of stress (she is not vaccinated).  </p>
<p>I didn't go to the hospital with her, but my uncle (who went with her) said that one of the first questions that the paramedics made were: "was she vaccinated recently?"  </p>
<p>You may think: "they are just asking how careful they must be with the patient because of COVID"... I disagree, that word... "recently"... was put there for a reason.  </p>
<p>Take your own conclusions.  </p>
<p>But, in my opinion, if they asked this...It is because this is happening very often as adverse effect of the vaccine.  </p>
<p>P.S.: She is showing signs of fast recovery :)</p></p>

        <p>My Bro has his jab, day later paralysed down one side of face and shoulder. The doc said Bells Palsy, no mention of the vaccine. A week later he's diagnosed as having a stroke, losing his memory too he forgot he had kids to pick up from school and forgot where parents live.</p>
<p>The docs say he's not to take the 2nd jab due to his condition, a condition a fit and health 43y old didn't have before his first shot.</p>
<p>When I speak to anyone at work or outside of the family 'well it can't be due to the jab, must be coincidence'. Not a word or 'is he OK'!</p>
<p>Everything for over a year is C19, nothing is due to the Vac.</p>
<p>It's a clown world and I've lost any respect for most people to think for themselves anymore.</p>

        <p>If this is true, now I’m scared. Not for a single day I feared this supposed virus, but this experimental vaccine otherwise…</p>

        <p>Its very much true. The same day the my brother had his my neighbour has his too, 62 years old and <em>was</em> fit and healthy, he had a heart attack whilst waiting the 15mins recovery time after the jab and they couldn't revive him. That was not a good week. And with Joe's after effects we got scared, and now he's deteriorating things are worrying.</p>
<p>I'm with you on not fearing the virus in over a year, and therefore don't feel I need the vac. It's not for me, I'm 47 and in decent health.</p>
<p>If it was truly the most deadly thing the world had seen we'd all be crying out for a vaccine, not needing to be advertised to get it 24x7 and offered free donut incentives too.</p>
<p>And there wouldn't be different companies coming up with different solutions, it surely would be the whole world working as one against the one virus.</p>
<p>If I need it I'll look for the best medicine when the time comes, as for now I don't feel I need it.</p>

        <p>My fiancée is a paramedic and you are correct in your assumption. They are asking if they are recently vaxxed to see if that is a cause of symptoms. Especially after the J&amp;J vaxs with the blood clots. 
One of the many reasons we are not getting it. It’s a legit question they ask know. Idk if they all do but know she does and some doctors ask too.</p>
