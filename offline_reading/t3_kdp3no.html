    <strong>What's life really like in a communist technocracy?</strong>
    <p><p>Since the NWO is going to impose its highly successful China model upon us, I thought I'd better find out what we're looking at.</p>
<p>Is anyone here familiar with what daily life is like in China?</p>
<p>Do people own anything, or do they rent everything from the state?</p>
<p>Do they live in constant fear?</p>
<p>What's the role of private companies? How do they operate? Do you have to be part of the elite to have a company?</p>
<p>What's the society like? Do people help each other or snitch on each other?</p>
<p><strong>PS</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for all the comments, even though they make grim reading.</p>
<p>More questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do people in China afford those super-expensive luxury flats in Shanghai or the latest iPhones? Because both sell like hotcakes there.</li>
<li>How / why are so many Chinese students allowed to study abroad every year? Does it not bother the elite that the youth may get "corrupted" and start getting ideas?</li>
</ul></p>

        <p>I've visited a communist country before.</p>
<p>It's not fun. No, really. </p>
<p>The shutdowns have always reminded me of that country. No entertainment venues, no proper places to hang out, nowhere to really go to except maybe a supermarket nearby, and so on. All information is controlled by the state, so there's only two channels on the TV, one of which is a propaganda news station and the other is mostly random shows and the occasional political news conference. On some days, food and supplies get rationed, so you are told to only go on so-and-so days to buy things. You don't have freedom of movement. It was also unsettling sometimes because military convoys would ride by at times into the neighborhood I would stay at.</p>

        <p>I have not been to China, but I have been to many other 3rd world and Eastern Bloc countries.</p>
<p>- First off, human life has little or no value. Want an example? Look up the video of the Chinese toddler who gets struck by a car on a busy street. People literally just keep walking, stepping around or over the dying kid like he is a pile of dog poo.</p>
<p>- Future-time-orientation does not exist. They will pollute, destroy, and deface anything for short term gain. I like to call it the "Orc Mentality". This includes fucking over anyone, anywhere you can gain advantage from. This is the root cause of why these countries are dirty, corrupt, smog-ridden shitholes.</p>
<p>- Privacy and personal freedom mean nothing. The masses are kept quiet by ignorance, coercion, and (in the case of China) shallow materialism. It's a function of trying to control massive populations - the only way to do this is to basically run things like a human anthill.</p>
<p>You can easily see a microcosm of this mentality anywhere there is a large Chinese expat (settler/colonist) population, or in commercial establishments they frequent. Take T&amp;T grocery stores as an example - pushing, shoving, queue-jumping, noise, chaos. And mayhem in the parking lot.</p>
<p>And their wealthy elites who buy their way into our countries behave as though they are not subject to or constrained by our petty rules of civil society - watch the behaviour of super-car driving young Chinese in places like Vancouver to see their real attitude towards us and our values on display.</p>

        <p>Someone told me that the government owns your home and your family gets to hold it for 70 years before it’s turned over to another family or the house is destroyed, not really sure what happens to the house or where the family moves to, haven’t independently verified any of this.</p>

        <p>Although I didn't live in a communist country, it was similar in its nepocratic structure.</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt; Do people own anything, or do they rent everything from the state?</p>
<p>No one but the inner party members own anything. They may own it in name, but the state can revoke and acquire any assets it wants. The lower down you are in the party, the easier you are to fuck with. Most rent their stuff.</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt; Do they live in constant fear?</p>
<p>Yes and no. A lot do. But just like in the US and other western nations, people develop psychological defenses against it. So they ignore it, pretend everything's fine, etc.</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt; What's the role of private companies? How do they operate? Do you have to be part of the elite to have a company?</p>
<p>Yes. It is well known that to make it anywhere you need a party member as a big part of your business. When I say big part, it's not that they do a lot of work or even contribute to the company. All it means is that they get a big share of your profits/deliverables. In return, they provide protection for you from other party members.</p>
<p>\&rt;&rt; What's the society like? Do people help each other or snitch on each other?</p>
<p>People do NOT help each other. Being kind is seen as a liability. It's largely dog-eat-dog.</p>

<p>To add to my other comment. It depends. At the place I went to, there was a sort of sense of community...between people who knew of or assumed each other's loyalties. The communists would turn on people who questioned the government, and they made it known. So people acted friendly on the surface, but if you stepped a toe out of line, they would then ostacize you, and make your life hell.</p>

        <p>Nah, that's just what the technocracy wants. Even in my home country, where people are killed on the streets for opposing the power centers, we still will never give up. Hard times make hard men/women!</p>
