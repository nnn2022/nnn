<title>New York transit no longer admits that masks stop the spread. They simply cannot make this claim, because they know it's false. So instead, new message says, "show passengers RESPECT" by wearing mask. So this ISN'T a hoax?</title>

        <p>Of course it's all a hoax. Covid mostly hurt the sick and dying. It did it's damage and moved on. Our reaction to it has been one giant hoax. Hiding all info about hydroxichloriquin was a hoax.</p>

        <p>"Respect" was an early keyword.  An old and dear friend who has swallowed the kool-aid used that word a month or two ago when I was asking her about the mask situation where she lives.</p>

        <p>I don't have a sense of altruism anymore. People have been locked at home for months, given up all social activities, given up medical care, education and income, and given up all the things they look forward to in life. Haven't we done enough for the benefit of others? At what point do I get to focus on myself?</p>

        <p>Mask wearing was a hoax but, I believe, it began with good intentions. People are stupid and the easiest way to convince them things are getting better is to give them a nice visible sign of it.</p>
<p>Masks don't reduce the spread of Covid-19 but because stupid people think that they do, wearing masks gives those idiots confidence to go out. This is, of course, bad policy and compelling people to do something stupid rather than educating the hoi polloi on the facts is not a long-term win. But in the shortest of terms, it probably felt like that.</p>

        <p>I was wearing a mask to skating last week. I had to cough, so I stood far away from everyone (easy to do on the ice) and coughed into my elbow. I pulled my mask down before doing so. I should know within a few weeks how many corpses I have to skate over during practice! /s</p>

        <p>&rt; wearing masks gives those idiots confidence to go out </p>
<p>remember, that the same monsters, who pushed the slave mask mandates are the ones who pushed home arrest.</p>
<p>all of it was and is fear based, rather than science and fact based.</p>
<p>&rt; I believe, it began with good intentions </p>
<p>no it did not. i mean come on, u can clearly see this as everything gets pushed towards a cashless digital dystopia with  tracking of your every move and restrictions on everything and forced injections.</p>
<p>it is also important to separate here.</p>
<p>some local idiot politicians, who didn't understand the science at the time and meant while, might have suggested  masks on a complete voluntary basis, but the general centralized agenda pushed out world wide from top to bottom, that  is uses masks to create a massive sense of fear, create physical harm, torture people and children, isolate people from each other and create a sense of  investment in the fake pandemic.</p>
<p>now u are wearing the mask under coercion, but u still do. so u are part of the ones pushing the agenda, u are invested in it. u might even end up attacking people, who aren't wearing one, because u gave up your freedom and invested into this insanity, so why should this person get away without doing what u are going through with this stupid mask, right?</p>
<p>mask mandates  also fully go against the constitution and basic human rights, so  no government ever has the right to mandate this based on whatever information. this is important to remeber.</p>
<p>and the mandates on masks are also there to  create acceptance for the eventual forced vaccines.</p>
<p>they will tell u, that u might no longer need to wear your slave mask, when u take bill gates dna changing vaccine with who knows what in it. they will tell u, that the vaccine will get u back to your family, to your life, etc.. etc...</p>
<p>but of course it won't and u might die from it, like happened in the early studies:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.lug-info.com/news/one/four-ukrainian-army-servicemen-die-in-covid-19-vaccine-trial-21136?fbclid">http://en.lug-info.com/news/one/four-ukrainian-army-servicemen-die-in-covid-19-vaccine-trial-21136?fbclid</a> </p>
<p>or worse.</p>
<p>the masks are part of psychological warfare against us. if u think, that a little mask can't be, then i would suggest, that u look at what torture is and whether or not we are getting tortured by governments right now with masks being part of it:</p>

        <p>I think the Austrians were one of the first governments that went for mask mandates back in April. They probably thought along your lines "cant hurt and is an easy way out..." boy did this come back to bite them in the ass. When they got rid of it people came back asking for masking (sorry ;) ), so they can feel safe again.</p>

        <p>NY is also airing commercials and ads every few minutes/ft saying that “testing is the way we beat covid, go get tested”. It’s clear they’re desperate to test so they find some so their actions can be more justified and they can shut down again and push the mask thing even more. It’s insane out here</p>

        <p>Yes. It's everywhere. I approve of testing for data analytics reasons,  but not to justify lockdown when the supporting evidence is contrary. Only in a clown world would we shut down the economy because of positive results.</p>

        <p>One of the graph makers for my state covid sub was saying how much it sucks that we sort of hit a bottom on percent positive, was saying it would be awesome to see 1% but that's literally impossible when the tests have a false positive rate of at least 3%.</p>
<p>That's why NY NJ wants to pump the testing up because at least your gaurenteed a few hundred positive cases off the error margin alone if you test enough.</p>

        <p>We knew it was bullshit all along.  "Hoax" implies a certain intent to deceive, which I still don't see.  I see people acting in good faith, and making horrible decisions, and then either doubling down on their bad decisions or making more bad decisions to save face from their previous bad decisions.</p>

        <p>I alwahs thought this. "Wear it to be respectful." I have been tested four fucking times due to being exposed to covid people being in the same room/next to me at work. 2 times no ppe because it was pre-fear mongering. At this point, I am not going to spread it because I don't fucking have it. My dumbass figured that masks will keep me safe from getting the crap from the covid zombies. But people still getting sick from it with masks. So my ass must be lucky. At the beginning I was selfish, I wore it to keep myself safe from getting infected, however now it just seems like a false sense of security.</p>

        <p>This is about humiliation, submission, and control, not any objective concept of health or safety; that much is obvious by now.</p>
