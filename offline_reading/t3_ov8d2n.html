    <p><p>This is literally the bs situation we are in right now. Vaccines will never be able to keep up with mutations.</p></p>

        <p>The general public is stupid and doesn’t get that. They also don’t get when a virus mutates the strain becomes weaker not more lethal</p>

        <p>I always thought the flu shot was weird. Little did j know that it would be a predictor for what happened. </p>
<p>Even at my college, every year they would do a flu shot drive in the lunch room. My friends would consistently get it. When they noticed I wouldn't get it, they started to try and make me look stupid. "You'll get the flu" they said. </p>
<p>After 2 weeks, they would have an extreme case of the flu while I was fine. </p>
<p>Now covid hit, the same thing is going to happen. Since the start I've done no precautions. Even now, I have worked at high populated events, never worn a mask and haven't had Covid. </p>
<p>My friend who were vaccinated all got some sort of sickness.</p>
