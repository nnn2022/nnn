    <strong>Confused and anxious</strong>
    <p><p>I’m on here because I had debilitating anxiety BEFORE Covid about harming someone or doing something that ultimately caused their death. You can imagine how I feel now. I think masks and social distancing and lockdowns are dumb but when I don’t follow the rules I panic for a week because I’m afraid I killed someone.  I see how this thing has destroyed my mental health but there is still a part of me that wonders “what if it’s true?” What if following these rules just keeps one person alive; isn’t it worth it? It’s making me crazy.  I tried going out to dinner last night and I was so anxious my muscles got tight and sore. I’m not afraid of getting sick; I just feel like this has played into my fear and I can’t get past it. I need some perspective.</p></p>

        <p>Hey, this is a personal anecdote but maybe it will help. I also have a great fear of harming someone else. But the truth is, we may all of unintentionally harmed someone in some way and there's no way to know it. </p>
<p>A few years back I was sick with an intense cold and went over to my mom's house. She ended up getting it and it somehow transformed into pneumonia and she almost died. I think back to that now. I didn't think of wearing a mask, because I had a cold. Why would I? So if she had died, would it have been my fault? I came to the conclusion that it really wouldn't have been. Because we are all humans and we can't live our lives in fear that we may end up accidentally giving someone a cold and it turns into something else. </p>
<p>It's literally impossible. It's not like we have AIDS and are going around purposefully sleeping unprotected with other people. It's the same with covid. The truth is, I've known about 5 people in my family alone who have had it.. My elderly grandmother had it who was already in the ICU for congestive heart failure and diabetes complications. She didn't die and is actually doing really well not even a week after. </p>
<p>My point is that you could literally have something as innocent as a cold in the future and could give it to someone else who ends up having severe complications from it. Or you could be driving a car and someone accidentally runs in front of it and does. That's terrible and I hope that never happens. But it could and it does and it does not mean you are a bad person or did anything wrong. </p>
<p>We have to go on living our lives because if we stay locked inside that for sure will cause depression, mass poverty, and starvation, among other things and submitting to that does actually have a negative affect on others and harms them.</p>

        <p>I am lucky in that I don’t suffer from this same sort of covid related anxiety, but I really appreciate the thoughtfulness of your anecdote. Very well said and poignant.  I have one thought to add that might help OP - </p>
<p>Prior to COVID, if someone you knew had given YOU something as innocent as a cold and you had gotten really sick from it, would you have blamed that person or thought your illness their fault? How about post-COVID? Or what if, pre COVID, someone you loved gave something as innocent as a cold to another person you loved and then he or she got really sick. Would you have blamed the loved one who accidentally / innocently passed on that run-of-the-mill cold virus? How about now? </p>
<p>If the answer in the above hypotheticals is “no”, you would not blame the innocent transmitter of a common cold virus for the harm or death that may befall another, then the blame or fault you would not assign to another, you cannot (or should not) assign to yourself under parallel circumstance.</p>

        <p>No I wouldn’t blame anyone else. I hold myself to an impossible standard but you’re right I don’t hold others to the same standard.</p>

        <p>That makes sense, but I guess it’s hard to see it as “just a cold.” That’s definitely not what the majority of people think. And when I start to lean more that way (thinking of it as a regular cold or flu) I hear of someone else dying. Not just strangers but family friends who are young (in their 50’s) and healthy. Then I swing like a pendulum to the other side of the spectrum. Like OMG this is a deadly disease and I need to keep my mask on and social distance.  But living like that for the past year is just so tough. And saying that gets you called a selfish murderer. Harsh!</p>
