    <strong>[UnpopularOpinion] I would rather pay teachers full salary to do nothing at home, just to keep the public schools closed forever</strong>
    <p><p>I don't understand why people are so eager to force public schools to open, when the public school system is one of primary causes of producing generations of mindless drones who have no critical thinking skills and common sense. This is especially more puzzling given that conservatives and political dissidents are the ones at the forefront of trying to get public schools to open. The public schools are the primary facility of the state to foster obedience, helplessness and conformity. Don't fight on behalf of the opening of the public schools.</p>
<p>I get that most people care deeply about their children's future and education and this is a wonderful thing. But we shouldn't confuse public schools with valuable education. The public school today are not your average schools you attended when you were young. It's changed even compared to just 10 years ago. There's so much fully "woke" garbage injected into impressionable young minds and the children are imprinted to think about things that are worse than useless. Here are example of such from just last couple of months, and you know there are so much more.</p>

        <p>Boy, do I agree with this post. </p>
<p>I’m planning on having children in the next couple of years and I’m quietly waiting for better alternatives to public schools. </p>
<p>Homeschooling is my personal choice, though my wife thinks we’d be driven crazy.</p>

        <p>I agree. Public schools have been a cesspool of poison even before the scamdemic. I mean, I know WHY they want them open ($$$$$) but it shouldn't be a high priority, even disregarding the hoax virus.</p>

        <p>Fuck public schooling.  You can socialize kids in a neighborhood home schooling system and since there's more adults involved in watching the children they're personally invested in, they don't have to vie for the attention of one extremely disinterested just out of college graduate that's barely older than them and they can catch any shitty or creepy behavior right away and take a child out of a toxic environment before it goes too far.</p>

        <p>People need to work. A lot of women had to stop working and stay at home to teach their kids because of this. Public school is garbage, I agree. I’m a big supporter of charter schools and homeschooling for those who WANT to do it. But these “teachers” don’t deserve a free pass to laziness when a lot of us have been, and have wanted to be, working in person this entire time. They should go to work or quit or be fired just like anyone else.</p>

        <p>Alternatively, at least push for parents to teach their kids themselves as a supplement to school. Plenty of parents already offer valuable life lessons and morals, but if they don’t push for their kids to educate themselves, the next generation will suffer.</p>
