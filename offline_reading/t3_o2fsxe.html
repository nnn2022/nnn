    <strong>Vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting covid or giving covid to others?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been very skeptical about the whole pandemic pretty much since May of last year, and now that the vaccines are here and people everywhere are getting it, I wanted to know if it's true that the vaccine doesn't prevent covid and/or prevent you from giving covid to others?</p>
<p>I went onto the CDC website and it states plainly it does stop people from getting covid, but because of all of the lies and propaganda surrounding Covid-19, I of course don't believe it for one second. Now I've heard from many different people and posts that it doesn't prevent covid, it just reduces the symptoms. But I wanted to see if anyone here may have any sources that can easily prove this, because honestly most of the time I hear about this it's from posts on reddit or facebook, and I don't want to be the guy that just blindly agrees with a Facebook meme. </p>
<p>I definitely won't be getting the vaccine either way, but I'd like accurate information to relay to people because there's a situation in my personal life where a friend of mine is moving in with his brother, and his brother told him that he needs to start thinking about taking the vaccine when he moves in. </p>
<p>His brother and wife are both very far left people, the typical anti-trump, anti-conservative, pro-socialism types, and I want to give my friend some sources to give to them to try to point out the inconsistencies with getting jabbed. It's stupid too since they both have gotten their vaccines (both doses) and they're still wanting my friend to get the vaccine... its ridiculous because if they got it and it does prevent covid, there's nothing to worry about, but if it doesn't then what's the point of getting the vaccine?</p>
<p>Regardless, if anyone has any info that i can give to my friend, that'd be fantastic, thanks!</p></p>

        <p>So, here the CDC explains that they only count “vaccine breakthrough cases” (those who get infected with covid after vaccination) if they get hospitalized, or die: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html</p>
<p>With the manipulation of that data, of course breakthroughs seem rare, because hospitalizations are rare to begin with. </p>
<p>A previous poster shared the CDC article about their “growing body of evidence” that vaccines prevent transmission, however their sources were loads of non-peer reviewed studies. They note this themselves just above their reference list, that such studies are not reliable. </p>
<p>The FDA confirms it’s still unknown whether the vaccines prevent transmission: https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-frequently-asked-questions</p>
<p>“<em>Most vaccines that protect from viral illnesses also reduce transmission of the virus that causes the disease by those who are vaccinated. While it is hoped this will be the case, the scientific community does not yet know if the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine will reduce such transmission.</em>”</p>

        <p>Right. The symptoms of Covid. That said, if it only lessons the symptoms, but not the spread of the disease that causes said symptoms, the vaccination status of others has literally no effect on you or me. So why should we care what others chose to do? Don't get the jab, catch the rona and die? That's on you. Get the jab, catch rona and be fine? Cool too. Take a vaccine that literally 0 people on Earth know the long term side effects of and then die? Not my problem either. Freedom means choices and choices have consequences. Good, bad or other.</p>

        <p>The reason you don’t get the illness is your body is destroying the virus rather than becoming a virus factory. You absolutely are less contagious and for less time.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The act of coughing due to symptomatic dz makes the spread more effective</p>

        <p>Sounds like this guy gets it. There is less coughing. There is also a smaller number of viruses in your body. Fewer viruses means less virus getting out if you do cough.</p>

        <p>Yeah neutralizing antibodies jump on the virus before it has a chance to effectively replicate in the host cells. So, vaxed people can ‘get’ covid, but as you pointed out you’re less contagious with the the vax, if at all.</p>

        <p>Wrong. I seem to remember that SARS-CoV-2 is what is defined as an AIRBORNE virus where you just have to breathe NORMALLY to spread it.</p>
<p>In that case, having people with lesser symptoms might be a bad thing, especially if their viral load is actually EQUAL TO or GREATER than those people who have symptoms.</p>

        <p>Why are you bring Trump into this?  He got the vaccine.  Vaccines aren't miracle cures or magic shields, the real strength of any vaccine is that when enough people get it we reach herd immunity and stop the virus from spreading and mutating.</p>
