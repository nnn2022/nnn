    <strong>My friend is “horrified” of COVID but marched in several BLM protests.</strong>
    <p><p>But he “stayed on the sidelines and had a mask on securely”.</p>
<p>Won’t go in a restaurant either out of fear - only outdoor seating.</p>
<p>And he’s had “countless anxiety attacks” since this all started.</p></p>

        <p>I feel terrible for people like that. I was one of them when it first started, wearing masks <em>and</em> gloves. I was riddled with fear, anxiety and hate. Then, I stepped back, looked at what I had become, and didn't like it one bit.</p>

        <p>I've seen many, <strong>many</strong> people like this, online and in real life.</p>
<p>For instance, one of my neighbors is horrified as well, and tends to bully me because I don't wear my mask outdoors in my yard, so I've clashed with her many times. She is so afraid, she and her spouse made a fruit and vegetable garden because she fears the virus is going to spread so much that there will be a societal collapse soon. I catch her with a cloth mask, gloves, and a face shield when she goes out. Yet this lady also has parties all the time, with all her guests and herself masked of course, but still. She is also a Biden fan, and a BLM march supporter, based on the signage in her yard. "Rules for thee, not for me" basically.</p>
<p>(I see people in this sub commend people like this woman as "heroes" for "rebelling". Keep in mind, these folks are not spitting in the eye of the government, they just think they are so SPESHUL that they should be allowed to have their own gatherings and be able to go out in public, while everyone else has to grovel in misery. They <strong>are</strong> terrified of dying with this virus, but they also want to have their bread and circuses so they won't be <em>too</em> bored with their lives. These people are selfish motherfuckers, and they are NOT our allies here.)</p>

        <p>That’s really odd. It’s really frightening - anything you say against the lockdown crap makes you a bad person.</p>
<p>“Oh sorry DYING ELDERS AND IMMUNOCOMPROMISED are disrupting your convenience of GETTING A SANDWICH”.</p>
<p>“Saying mask wearing is a personal choice just proves people hiding under the guise of civil liberty don’t view service workers as human beings”.</p>
<p>THIS is causing such a class divide. The blue collar workers were fucked and jobless, while the white collar computer brigade got to work from home from bed. They really can’t understand this.</p>
<p>There’s nothing we can say.</p>

        <p>I've seen blue collar workers who lost their jobs, and got fucked over, yet they are 100% in support of this. I don't know for an absolute fact, but the lady I mentioned seems to have lost her job as a manager at some store she was at. But she is so scared, she supports the lockdowns, New Normal, etc. (I suspect she is also getting the unemployment payments as well...) Some store owners, who lost their businesses and livelihoods, are kissing their tyrannical governor or ruler's asses for "keeping them safe". </p>
<p>Some people who work from home are currently miserable, and hate it. My spouse is one of them. Some people in this sub have also stated they work from home, but hate it.</p>
<p>I get tired of people using this as an excuse to trash entire groups as being "the evil villains" like work from home employees, gamers, the obese, liberals, etc. Clearly, people from various walks of life are in support and against the lockdowns...</p>

        <p>I wasn’t saying that at all.</p>
<p>I’m WFH and loved it at first but not anymore.</p>
<p>I’m just out of college, and most of what I see from my age demographic are people who strongly support the lockdowns and mask mandates - while they also whine that they urgently need unemployment checks since the restaurant they waitress at is closed.</p>
<p>I don’t know how you took my comment initially, but I meant it’s strange how many low level service workers are all for this BS while whining that “no man should have as much money as Bezos” and “screw the big corporations” (oh, the only places allowed open?). This lockdown crap is driving an even further wedge between American socioeconomic classes.</p>

        <p>Oh, I see. I misinterpreted your comment. Sorry about that. I do see that attitude a lot around here, so I thought that was what you were saying. </p>
<p>I honestly don't know what else we can do at this point. I'm very close to just giving up, and just waiting to see what's going to happen next. In spite of what people here claim, I do not see as a "majority", silent or otherwise. Most people seem very comfortable with how the situation is unfolding right now, and we are just a pack of clowns they can make fun of.</p>

        <p>And they also see their serving jobs as “risking their life” when it’s not exactly life threatening to be waiting tables. That’s probably the driver behind why they want the unemployment.</p>

        <p>I mean...a societal collapse is possible, but due to the economic ruin that may come.</p>
<p>Also, I've seen the "terrified of the virus" lot assume the worst, and are taking all these precautions to survive this "plague". I just roll my eyes at their excessive and paranoid behavior.</p>

        <p>I had a friend who is an absolute doomer, who went to the protests half a dozen times.  She then got a Covid test two weeks after, which was negative.  She used that as evidence that “protests aren’t spreading Covid.”
She has a PhD. 
I don’t think I could ever take her seriously again.</p>
<p>Edit: The whole notion that everyone at the protests was social distancing and wearing masks is completely phony. I went one day just to check it out, I live in a major US metropolis.  No one was social distancing and the biggest shouters were not wearing masks. Honestly that was the day I went full skeptic.</p>

        <p>Thinking there's a problem with policing in this country and being against lockdowns aren't mutually exclusive, as someone who both thinks this authoritarian nonsense is bullshit and attended the protests. The protests were in response to authoritarianism. I oppose all forms of that, including draconian lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Good on him. Don't agree with most of BLM's points personally but I'll support anyone's right to peaceful assembly whether I agree with them or not. Provided of course it's not a 'mostly peaceful' assembly. We have them to thank for showing that most of these restrictions are unnecessary, and possibly for building immunity around the old and vulnerable.</p>

        <p>/r/publicfreakout is the worst for this.  </p>
<p>They posted a video of 10,000s of people gathering for black trans matter and other huge protests in June/July.  </p>
<p>This same sub posts all these protest videos, people screaming, shouting touching each other, not all wearing masks.  </p>
<p>Then guess what. They posted a video of a little girl meeting her two friends and all the comments were "SURPRISE COVID" one said "Fuck you stay home" and so many others. One even referenced a ventilator.  </p>
<p>And right there on the frontpage was also protest videos and they didn't have the same comments.  </p>
<p>It's disgusting how these liberals are so smug and always virtuous. They can literally break their own lockdown they support and still call others murderers for meeting less people the same day. They can even set up drug filled "occupied protests" and support that and call it a "summer of love".   </p>
<p>They are seriously delusional. They think people don't see this. They actually call people that don't fall for this "science deniers" and they think people aren't wising up to their bullshit and are in for a rude awakening in November.  </p>
<p>They cannot even think straight. I see big lefty tubers and personalities like Sam Seder or Beau of the Fifth column literally talk about "Republicans want dead kids" when it's clear that kids are not at risk whatsoever, they just cannot ever let go of the "we are good, you are evil narrative", people are thoroughly rejecting this.  </p>
<p>The "science" is arbitrary, nonsensical and hugely political and just a vehicle for their agenda at this point. I can't wait for them to get a rude awakening.</p>

        <p>I’m afraid there isn’t a “silent majority” of us though. I’m scared for November. I’m just out of college and almost everything I see posted online from my peers is this. Then again, it’s social suicide to voice disagreement, so maybe they’re all shut up like I am.</p>
