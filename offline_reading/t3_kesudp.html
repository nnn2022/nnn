        <p>It is a combination of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, Japan has had for decades a broken health system. There are too many hospitals, in fact Japan has one of the world largest bed count in the world, but all hospitals are way understaffed.</p>
<p>Most hospitals in Japan lack an emergency room, and their working hours are actually worse than that of banks. Most hospitals do not work in weekends, and at least another day in the middle of the week, and most close at about 4PM.</p>
<p>This has lead to stories like these for many years:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna29013386">Injured man dies after rejection by 14 hospitals (nbcnews.com)</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/01/06/national/injured-man-denied-by-five-hospitals-dies/">Injured man denied by five hospitals dies | The Japan Times</a></p>
<p><a href="http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/japan-man-dies-after-hospitals-reject-him-36-times/1083368/">Japan man dies after hospitals reject him 36 times - Indian Express</a></p>
<p>You can actually read a very interesting free manga, in English, about all of the problems of the health system in Japan called "Give my Regards to Black Jack"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ebookrenta.com/renta/sc/frm/item/55918/">Give My Regards to Black Jack | Shuho Sato | Renta! - Official digital-manga store (ebookrenta.com)</a></p>
<p>And the second point is, SARS-CoV-2 is now an "Special Designated infectious disease", equivalent to Category 1 and Category 2 diseases, which makes it legally equivalent to Ebola or the Black Death, and basically anyone who shows positive is getting hospitalized, regardless of symptoms.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they changed a little bit this, and made it such that if people showed no symptoms or mild symptoms they would be instead put in quarantine in mostly hotels, but the problem is the number of rooms is also getting limited, and people who show fever are getting for the most part hospitalized anyway.</p>
<p>Not to mention that local governments are actually ignoring this change in the law, and many continue to hospitalize every single positive SARS-CoV-2 case.</p>
<p>Also, beds for people with fever, and specially people with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have designed beds that are just for them, and the number is limited for already limited hospital resources because of how understaffed hospitals are.</p>
<p>So yeah, it is a self fulfilling prophecy, it almost seems like they are doing everything they can to fuck this up.</p>

        <p>Hospitals with bank hours?  Better not get sick on weekends haha.</p>
<p>Probably due to their socialized medicine.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info.  I didn't know any of that about Japan</p>

        <p>You say it as a joke, but people in Japan do actually usually say "Try not to get sick on weekends or at night".</p>
<p>In fact, if you get in an ambulance at night or on weekends, chances are you are going to get subpar medical attention.</p>
<p>The thing is, the medicine in Japan isn't THAT socialized, I mean, it isn't like some of those countries were you don't have to pay anything, you still have to pay about 30% plus your monthly premiums on health insurance, which depend 100% on income.</p>
<p>The thing with Japan is that the medical sector is HEAVILY regulated.</p>
<p>Hospitals and clinics cannot be "for-profit", and the prices for ALL procedures are already decided by the government.</p>
<p>This has created a very nasty incentive in Japan, where there are hundred of dummy "non-profit" organizations to create hospitals, were they take all the measures posible to maximize profit under this heavily regulated environment.</p>
<p>That means, because what only matters are the "points" the hospital get from each procedure, trying to get as many patients as posible in a very small spawn, and reduce the time patients see their doctors, while also making patients take all sort of unnecessary tests and giving them unnecessary drugs just to get paid more is the rule.</p>
<p>The reason why hospital close on weekend and night is because, it isn't profitable. Most people who go to the hospital are the elderly, who for the most part go in the early morning, and usually have plans on weekends.</p>
<p>So yeah, prohibiting "for-profit" medicine has made the system all about profit.</p>

        <p>Crazy.  And Japan is always sold as an argument for socialized medicine.  Although yeah 30% is pretty high.  How do the poor pay for it?  I am mad about 20% in the US.</p>

        <p>It is a highly convoluted system.</p>
<p>If someone is under "Seikatsu-hogo", which is the main form of welfare here in Japan for people who do not make enough money to subsist, all of their medical fees are free.</p>
<p>But being in "Seikatsu-hogo" is a living hell, you have to live in somewhere approved by the government, which means a shithole, you lose most of your privacy, the government tracks every movement you do, and there are people from the city going to visit you all of the sudden.</p>
<p>They track all of your bank accounts, and it is extremely easy to get pulled out of the system because, for example, your parents sent you money.</p>
<p>That's why the number of people under the program is actually pretty low.</p>
<p>Also, the elderly and some other special categories only pay 10%.</p>
<p>There is also a pay limit that depends on your income and other stuff.</p>
<p>What this translates to is, a system in which you are for the most part overpaying very costly premiums each month, and pay 30% of anything plus premiums so that some minorities, specially the elderly, can go to the hospital weekly as a social activity.</p>
