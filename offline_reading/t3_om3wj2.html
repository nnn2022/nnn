        <p>Of course they were forced to retract. It’s that or basically ruin your career and life. It takes a great amount of courage these days to stand for truth.</p>

        <p>I saw one person on Twitter who says the author got fired from his job.</p>
<p>Do they have tenure at German universities? (The author was German)  I can't imagine this firing would be allowed at US universities.</p>

        <p>So rather than have other researchers conduct a study to try to replicate or disprove the results, they would rather just censor this one without giving any specifics as to why it was flawed? Yeah, that's not corrupt at all. /s</p>

        <p>You know, the original publish location has a comment section. It would be the first place to check for disagreements.</p>
<p>Some comments from there:</p>
<p>As a worst case, physical mask volume is about 25-50 ml of a 300 ml tidal inhalation. In their supplement the authors said they would measure the volume of the masks used but do not report this important detail.</p>
<p>Such measurement errors would become immediately obvious if the researchers had performed due baseline measurements, i.e. measurements without masks during the inspiratory phase only and the expiratory phase only.</p>
<p>Their results also show almost the same CO2 readings for both surgical masks and respirator FFP2 masks. If their findings were accurate you would expect a difference, given the differing filter capabilities. </p>
<p>The authors conclude that the reported elevated CO2 levels will lead “to impairments attributable to hypercapnia” without measuring the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). PaCO2 can be estimated non-invasively using a readily-available transcutaneous CO2 monitor or by measuring end-tidal CO2 via capnography [3]. Oxygen saturation data were also omitted despite apparently being collected.</p>

        <p>JAMA recently caved in to blowback on a podcast they did questioning whether structural racism existed in medicine. The Chief Editor asked a deputy ed to resign because of it. Then, that wasn't enough for the PC police so the Chief Ed had to also resign. The current editor knows he's on thin ice so you can imagine they'll bend to the slightest pressure to avoid any controversy. </p>
<p>Supposedly prestigious journals can operate in reality much like Reddit, when you get a small group of fanatics messaging the Admins with excuses to ban a sub. It doesn't take much of a write-in campaign to get editors nervous about their reputation getting hurt.</p>
