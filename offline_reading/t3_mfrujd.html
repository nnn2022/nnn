    <strong>What are some things we can do to 'legally' combat/protest the rising authoritarianism of government?</strong>
    <p><p>Mainly wondering about the US. When exactly does the government violate our rights, when does private businesses violate our rights, and what can we do in the moment and in the long run?</p>
<p>What can businesses do to get government to open businesses back up to the public?</p>
<p>this isn't just for me, it's for everyone. Please list the state that you're confident your response is most applicable for.</p></p>

        <p>Funny you mention "legally", where in the US constitution it mentions any time the powers are abused it is up to the governed to retake them. Dec of Ind says its best "But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government,"</p>

        <p>i'm not prepared to start, or participate, in a revolution or overthrow of the government. I'd assume there would need a total breakdown in business and civilian daily life to the point where revolution is the only option that is left. Otherwise, the civilian population will not be united in a way that I would assume is necessary to be effective.</p>
<p>plus, i don't want to be arrested, fined, or whatever because i refused to wear a mask. I'm far from being financially secured.</p>

        <p>well i have a lot of opionions on a lot of things that contribute to my perspective of the current state of things... but i haven't even really organized that thought out yet. i think I should really get more information before committing to any firm belief... but in general I do not think a revolution is anywhere near and the infringements of rights by having mask mandates and/or businesses requiring masks isn't enough to fuel a revolution. If you're now suspicious of my 'good-faith-ness' then you can read what I just wrote. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mfozvg/not_wanting_to_have_your_rights_continue_to_be/gsp7wqo?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">I don't agree but I do want to understand</a>.</p>
<p>personally, with my own limited knowledge and objectable (i'm assuming at least one person thinks i'm an idiot) understanding, I think that the health measures (masks, business closures, curfews) will spread the rate of hospitalized people so it's more manageable by the healthcares system until most of the population starts developing herd-ish immunity via non-serious infections, vaccines, and/or changing strains of the virus. I see in the next 2-5 years that things will start getting back to normal, but i've only had introductory classes to biology and nothing touching virology besides what I read on the internet.</p>

        <p>&rt;What is my perspective of the current state of things?</p>
<p>wow, i did not read that at all! at least not correctly! for some reason I read it is 'what is your perspective...'. I am sorry and I am embarressed!</p>
<p>ok... um, i do not know your perspective on the current state of things. At the time of you writing it, i only have your comment to reference. Your comment stated an opponent, what is at risk, and death as a potential price.... that leads me to assume that you view the current state as a moment, or very near the moment, where your life is at risk and if you don't take action then it will be too late to preserve your freedom.</p>
<p>that's all assumption based on the comment and the general feeling i get from the sub... i could be 85%(?) wrong, though?</p>

        <p>The constitution and the civil rights act apply to every state and every business operating within US borders.</p>
<p>“Mandates,” “ordinances,” “municipal codes,” none of these are <em>laws</em> and are not enforceable. It is very unlikely a police officer will arrest you for not wearing a mask. If one does, you would have a case for a federal civil rights violation.</p>
<p>A business does not have the right to enforce a medical device on your body. This is a violation of informed consent laws. Further, most states ( if not all) allow for medical/religious exemptions to the face mask/covering. A business asking for proof of either of these is a violation of HIPAA. That being said, I think saying “a mask makes me suicidal” is perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>Any business which opens its doors to the public is defined as a public accommodation. Restaurants. Clothing stores. Grocery stores. All public accommodations. A business cannot refuse service for “any reason.” Refusing service to someone without a mask <em>is discriminatory</em> as you don’t know why they might not be able to wear one. Asking this person to utilize curbside pickup or something like that is an <em>unreasonable accommodation</em> to me. I think it could be effectively argued in court that someone immunocompromised or otherwise scared of getting sick should utilize these services.  </p>
<p>It is possible a business will still refuse you service. Your only recourse at that point is to file a civil suit in federal court. In order to combat the tyranny spread by these businesses we must start holding them liable in court. Otherwise, they have no reason to fight the “health authorities” who are levying “mandates” and unlawful rules. It is easier for the businesses to tell us to wear a mask than it is to fight it out in court, so they take the least course of resistance. We must become the resistance.</p>
<p>Businesses are threatened with fines and other consequences for not obeying health ordinances. Again, these are not laws and businesses are allowing the fear of fines to control them. Taking the state to court over these fines would likely find them not guilty of violating any law, since there are no <em>laws</em> which describe the necessity of masks in public.</p>
<p>I tired to cover as much as I can. These are the basics. Love having discourse about the subject.</p>

        <p>For individuals, there really isn't anything you can do legally, especially when with the stroke of a pen your state dictator can scratch any freedoms, impose any new restrictions.  </p>
<p>The real hope here are legal consortia like Dr. Reiner Fuellmich's group doing all the insane legal legwork to sue those in power, and through the discovery process, uncover the rest of this mess.  I'd look to supporting them.</p>

        <p>The government is always violating your rights, its very existence depends upon it. Pragmatically speaking, its a one-way relationship. You may think you have a choice until you are fined, beaten, kidnapped, caged or killed.</p>
<p>Businesses violate your rights only through government force (bailouts from taxpayer money for example). For the most part its a two-way relationship. They can fire you if they no longer need you or if you're no longer being productive. You can quit if you don't feel they pay you enough, or if conditions are unsafe, etc. There's nothing they can do to force you to benefit them, on the flip side they may even offer you more money to stay.</p>
<p>Arm up, buy land/house in the deep woods, grow a like-minded community. Easier said than done of course.</p>
