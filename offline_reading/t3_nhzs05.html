    <strong>What do we do now</strong>
    <p><p>This subreddit has played such a good role in informing myself, to which I am led to ask, “now what?”. I’m an 18 year old college student who was robbed of their high school graduation, “senior summer”, and my first year of college, and would like to make meaningful change for those in my position and younger so that they don’t have rightful milestones and experiences taken away from them. I don’t want to approach this how the opposers do, with forcing information down their throats and doing so without compassion or dignity. All I see that I am able to do is sport a welcoming smile, and inform my peers when they ask. Does anyone else here have an idea of how the public can use their knowledge to fight the falsified none-sense that has become the government-fueled covid narrative? Striking resemblance of the covid situation to the early progression of the N@z1 regime. Change is integral, and time is of the essence, but I am clueless to how the truth and freedom of thought is to be given to the public.</p></p>

        <p>Good question. What springs to mind is resist and disobey every element of what our governments are saying. Ditch the mask now if you haven’t already. Avoid the injection like the plague. Get ready for things to get ugly. Hug your mother. Put your hope in Christ and in the coming restoration of all things - the new heaven and new earth. He will uphold you.</p>

        <p>Just as I assumed, this won’t end in the same manner it started. I’ve drifted from religion since I was 17, but the dark mental place that this social isolation has put me in is making me open that door again. Thanks for your input, as you all probably are more realistic than my thought of a peaceful transition to normality. I have my fingers crossed and am willing to be patient, but that has only gotten us so far</p>

        <p>This only ends in conflict. The politicians are all bought off so there’s no change from within. The courts and judges are bought off so there’s no justice to the abusers. Your vote has been compromised so there’s no voting to change this. My only advice is to arm yourself and wait. This won’t end well.</p>

        <p>Unfortunate as it is, you’re probably right. I hope this widespread wake up is sooner rather than later, I’ve had 4 friends who committed suicide due to drugs, depression, etc due to lockdown. Stay safe and stay on your 10 toes, I’m hopeful for a good outcome and widespread happiness for all</p>

        <p>As to you, and good observation. I must ask though, will this be as conflict-consumed as you say? The military, law enforcement, and working class can’t all be bought out, and I truly feel that when the breaking point of takeover is crossed, there will be harsh and outnumbered resistance upon the government. Any thoughts on this?</p>

        <p>It’s hard to say. This is an information war. One side is trying to fabricate a truth while the other is trying to reveal the truth. We really won’t know until it happens. Find like-minded people to hang out with. People you can rely on when shit goes down. Make sure you have multiple ways to contact them because most forms of communication are being censored and controlled.</p>

        <p>That sounds right, and is a good example of the level of uncertainty that is present. Good idea on securing communication methods, and having people in your circle is integral. Weather it happens today, tomorrow, or in the future, I hope the best for all, and I hope that in the same sense that people are advocating for religious salvation in this time, that the oppressors will have a miraculous change of direction and heart. Unlikely, but hope is all we have at this current state.</p>

        <p>Learn about the constitution and bill of rights. Here is a really great resource to learn it and it is a free class. I took this class and it is excellent:</p>
<p>https://online.hillsdale.edu/landing/constitution-101</p>
<p>Here are some ideas of how to become more active:</p>
<p>(1) Find a local activist group in your area, if there are any. See if you want to join them.</p>
<p>(2) On YouTube there are a number of people not much older then you that might be able to get you in contact with others. One person is Behizy. </p>
<p>(3) There are many topics to fight such as Critical Race Theory, defend our freedom of speech, defend our rights to bear arms, stop the mask mandates on children, get corrupt politicans out of office and replace with MAGA folk, and many more. Choose one that resonates with you and find an established group (from any location) that is fighting it and join them.</p>
<p>(4) You could start your own grass roots movement. You will need to do a lot of work and build a good group of people to help the cause.</p>
<p>(5) Start your own YouTube channel. You will need to grow it and network with others on YouTube.</p>
<p>(6) You could be like CatTurd on Twitter and just do that. He did start it two years ago and doesn’t know why it took off. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

        <p>You’re welcome. There is a group of lawyers suing people and organizations for crimes against humanity using the Nuremberg code. They are after the CDC, WHO, and NIH first and have 10 violations listed. I heard that each violation carries the death penalty. Take care.</p>
