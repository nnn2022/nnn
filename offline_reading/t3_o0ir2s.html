    <strong>Exposure to the common cold CAN protect against coronavirus, Yale study finds</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Researchers from Yale University have found that a virus that frequently causes colds triggers an immune response that may prevent a coronavirus from spreading in that same patient.</strong></p>

        <p>This was predicted over a year ago.</p>
<p>Korea and Japan had relatively less COVID deaths than the west.  Scientists tried to isolate variables to determine what was causing the disparity.</p>
<p>First they latched on to the visibly obvious difference - the masks.  But it quickly became apparent that the masks were useless.</p>
<p>Then virologist posited that due to China being the origin of many wild coronavirus diseases (called colds before 2020) that the neighboring countries had a deeper well of society with immunity protections against coronaviruses.</p>

        <p>"Common cold symptoms include a sore throat, sneezing, coughing, and headaches"</p>
<p>also known as the "delta" variant now</p>
<p>all those asymptomatic cases were just positives for a cold, just as the WHO were warned about by the makers of the assay, they told them it would happen and that all asian virus would be detected in April 2020 when the decided that only one sequence needed testing instead of three</p>

        <p>Yeah, this is what is referred to as innate immunity.  We have already seen cross reactivity before and we can estimate that between innate immunity and adaptive immunity, the vast majority of people that covid infects nothing is noticed and we don't even develop antibodies because the disease is wiped out on arrival.</p>
<p>People get confused between terms though. All of these would still be infections, but only a minute number become cases. </p>
<p>The main problem I have with accepting any of this is that we have never tried to establish the level of innate or cross reactive immunity. The whole point of the vaccine is supposedly to develop these two things, but we never check our pre-existing levels?</p>
<p>In September 2020, the WHO said there were three types of countries showing different covid outcomes and the best showed a median IFR of 0.09%. 1 in 1100 cases lead to death. Trying to identify and focus on the 1 in 1100 people.</p>
<p>The obvious thing to do would have been to adopt the practices that were most effective at lowering the loss of life years, they used it as an opportunity to promote a long term agenda.</p>
