    <strong>Elon Musk</strong>
    <p><p>What do you guys think?</p>
<p>He was pretty based last spring refusing to shut down the Tesla factory and eventually moving it to Texas, basically telling Gavin Newsom where to get fucked.</p>
<p>I used to really like him, and his actions around that time were strangely what started the gradual process of waking me up from my short phase of doomerism and eventually being redpilled in general.</p>
<p>That being said, I’m starting to not be so sure how I feel about Neuralink and his space agenda.</p>
<p>So what does this sub think of Elon Musk? Is he based? Controlled opposition? Secretly an alien? Just as bad as all the other billionaires?</p>
<p>I just figured I’d make a dedicated discussion thread for him because he gets mentioned a lot and it’s an interesting topic, but I haven’t seen one or at least not that I remember and not recently. I look forward to hearing all of your lovely opinions!</p></p>

        <p>That’s how I’m starting to feel too. And Grimes had a creepy song about AI and obtaining power recently. I used to listen to her a lot back in the day, before they were together, so that really stood out to me.</p>

        <p>Echoing what others have said:</p>
<p>We can't really know what kind of person he is directly, since we will never rub shoulders with such people. Twitter is as close as we can get to most of these rich people.</p>
<p>But we can, and should assume that billionaires will always choose expanding their empires over anything that benefits us directly. And, very importantly, we should assume that any "news" we get about them has been filtered through a very expensive PR machine - just look at what Bill Gates has been $doing$ in the last decade to completely alter the world's view of him, from a power-hungry monopolist to some kind of world vaccine messiah.</p>
<p>I think Elon Musk is quite likable as far as Twitter personalities go, but I would never assume for a moment that he's looking out for us. You don't get to play ball in the big leagues unless you make concessions to people even more powerful and evil than you are. We already know he cooperates with spooks (sending satellites up for them) - why should we assume he's not involving them with things like neuralink as well?</p>

        <p>Very well said, this is more or less what I’m thinking too. </p>
<p>I figured this would be the general consensus but he was given quite a bit of credit by the opposition at the beginning of the pandemic so I was curious to see if it had changed. No one’s defending him so far, lol</p>
