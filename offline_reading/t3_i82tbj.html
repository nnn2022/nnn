        <p>Not sure I buy this article at all. Yes, PCR testing is a crapshoot. But we have fully sequenced various mutations of sars-cov2. The author of the article couldn’t even use the proper virus name. </p>
<p>“A Genomic Perspective on the Origin and Emergence of SARS-CoV-2”
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420303287?via%3Dihub</p>
<p>&rt;    The earliest genomic genome sequence data made it clear that SARS-CoV-2 was a member of the genus Betacoronavirus and fell within a subgenus (Sarbecovirus) that includes SARS-CoV (MERS-CoV falls in a separate subgenus, Merbecovirus) (Lu et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020). Indeed, initial comparisons revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was approximately 79% similar to SARS-CoV at the nucleotide level. Of course, patterns of similarity vary greatly between genes, and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit only ∼72% nucleotide sequence similarity in the spike (S) protein, the key surface glycoprotein that interacts with host cell receptors</p>
<p>I would personally bet money that this pandemic is just history repeating itself. One of the common cold viruses is another coronavirus that appears to have come from cows. It was very likely more deadly at first and then settled into the background of flu season.</p>

        <p>How long ago was the cow virus?</p>

        <p>They don't know how long ago with any certainty. So the one thought to have possible come cattle is hCoV-OC43. They think that it may have been responsible for the respiratory pandemic that occurred 1889-1890.</p>
<p>The theory is that each coronavirus which can cause the "common cold" was once a pandemic of sorts at some point in history before they became what they are now, the common cold. That they were quite deadly at first then as the above poster said settled onto cold and flu season only causing complications in the very sick and elderly. All coronaviruses are thought to be zoonotic so start off in animals. We have only known of human coronviruses since the 1960s but they are likely to have existed LONG before that throughout history. We know that least 4 of the now 7 identified coronviruses that infect humans have been around a long time. Two have been since around the 1960s but we don't know how long precisely, could be far longer. The other 2 including the one above are thought to be far older. We don't know exactly how old. There may have been others in the past as well that died out at some point in history and no longer exist today.</p>
