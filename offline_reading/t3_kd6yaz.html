    <strong>anyone have sad/ funny stories of being banned from a subreddit over this?</strong>
    <p><p>I was banned from r/statenisland for pointing out that 1,100 is (approximately) 5% of 25,000.</p>
<p>For context, Cuomo had just said staten island had 25% of the city's covid deaths. When to date we have no more than 5%... and that 1,100 number includes 'probable' cases so it's likely even less.</p>
<p>Anyone else banned simply for stating a fact, or for something similarly ridiculous?</p></p>

        <p>absolutely. i made fun of people who're very pro lockdown and had regularly a massive gang up on me of bunch of doomers (mostly from covidiots). sometimes i would state facts, other times i would ask questions of the "why is blm allowed to gather" type, other times i made up songs ("if youre stupid and you know it wear your mask! etc etc"). it was glorious, their reactions just cracked me up. the more they make a fuss the more i am amused. i presented myself as a black woman in tech with an alter ego of georges sorositos, MD who went to the jewish community college of herbal medicine and stock market sorcery. i mean it was really supposed to be a joke, but you cant even joke these days can you?! let alone anything else</p>
<p>eventually  I had a stalking type doomer who'd just post the same idiotic thing over and over again and i called him a fggot back, and got completely wiped out off reddit because of "hate speech policies".  funny thing is, i too, am a sort of fggot lol</p>
<p>I mean this place (reddit) is such a censored echo chamber BS joke...it didnt use to be that way years ago.</p>

        <p>I have a 7 day ban from r/TrueChristian for saying that the Covid19 Vaccine caused 3 people to get Bell's Palsy, and has even killed people. Everything I said was true, but over there they have a silly Rule where you cannot spread what they deem "disinfo" so I was temp banned. </p>
<p>The mod who banned me there was implying in a comment to my post that the vaccine was not to blame for the volunteers getting Bell's Palsy. </p>
<p>I got news for them though, once the ban is lifted I will continue to spread the truth even if they perma ban me.</p>
