        <p>It’s been here far before this was ever considered a pandemic. Far before all the lockdowns. I had Covid early Jan 2020 and so so many others I know had ‘a mysterious respiratory illness’ Nov and December of 2019. When I got tested for the flu it was negative and the drs couldn’t tell me what I had. This was before Covid was a thing. Once Covid became mainstream I understood that was what I had, every symptom down to losing sense of taste, chest infection, trouble breathing etc. It took me ab two weeks to recover. </p>
<p>Life went on as normal for many months after Covid arrived, lockdowns shouldn’t be a thing.</p>

        <p>I am one of those people who had a mysterious respiratory illness but it was back in Feb. I was working closely w/ thousands of vendors from across the globe at the time. When I went to Urgent Care, I was absolutely terrified bec my doctors and nurses were basically in bio-hazard suits. At the time I didnt even know the term “PPE” yet. I remember thinking “holy shit, they are treating me like I have ebola!” It reminded me of that movie outbreak. Long story short, I lived to tell the tale, and was never confirmed to have corona. It wasn’t really even a “thing” people spoke about yet. I still wonder if I had it. Either way, it was scary af going to the dr for what I thought was a bad cold/flu, and not even being able to see the medical staffs face.</p>

        <p>I know, I am curious. I never got a test, partly out of protest, and partly bec I just wasn’t really motivated enough to, but considering donating blood. It would be interesting to know, even though like you said, it’s probably too late now. </p>
<p>My symptoms were: cough, trouble breathing, body aches, vomiting and diarrhea. Urgent Care couldn’t do much for me, but I did get some IV fluids for dehydration and that helped a lot.</p>

        <p>My wife had one of the mystery respiratory illnesses after a trip to San Diego last December. Lasted for six weeks. At the end of it her face was so swollen she couldn’t open her eyes. No amount of testing came up with a diagnosis. All signs pointed to lupus which came back negative. Although now we know that it triggers lupus symptoms in some people. It’s been around a good long time and nothing to get in a panic about.</p>

        <p>Mmmmhmmm... I thought so... they found that this was going around in summer 2019 here in the United States recently as well.</p>
<p>That shows that this is NOT a novel virus but one that most likely has been going around for years.</p>

        <p>To be honest, I am not very familiar with the Q-philosophy, what makes you think that? I can explain my response though. The reason I call it scamdemic is because the lockdown is a scam and there is no virus pandemic, because pandemics affect everyone and I am not affected (and nobody can prove me wrong on that). Now I am affected by the restrictions, which are placed under some emergency smokescreen (for my "good") therefore the scamdemic is a term that can best describe the present situation.</p>
