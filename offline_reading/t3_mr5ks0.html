        <p>Thanks for posting this link, that was an interesting read! I'm going to leave this post up in hope that it brings forth a civil discussion. I do believe the virus is real but it's not as dangerous as it's made out to be and it's a strain of coronaviruses that cause the common cold</p>

        <p>This is what I was thinking since May 2020, when I went to the CDC to check flu counts, and it said they were no longer tracking the flu as of April 2020, after having a discussion with my mother. Guess I was right and she is wrong. Can't wait until she is told ðŸ¤£</p>

        <p>Um, before telling your mother you might want to look up 'flu season' and see if there are other reasons why the CDC doesn't track the flu in late spring and summer...</p>

        <p>Technically they are both coronaviruses so I guess perhaps this is true on some level.  It's obvious that this one is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm">different than the normal flu</a> but there are also many similarities as well.  "Covid is fake" is a pretty bad argument.</p>

        <p>Without 59 celebritzies and a dozen corrupt leftist politicians supporting this doctor, it doesnâ€™t matter how true it is. It will get no traction at all, and may even result in someoneâ€™s early death.</p>

        <p>As an independent, skeptical of everyone, I'll need to dig deeper on this one.  It's like the guy wrote a press release and it was picked up by hundreds of linked list websites but their all rather scammy.   Dr. of what, where, was it a mail order Dr. degree or honorary degree? what else has published?   Saw this on Alex Jones who sadly enough has a better track record than MSM, but his shows are like a bad tabloid at the check out counter.  Wish MSM didn't lie to us a good deal of the time as I'm not a believer of the vaccine either, like their forcing us to take an experimental shot never been tested on humans until 2020 and failed every time since the 70's on animals.  Not a warm fuzzy feeling about that, not to mention the Death as a side effect on the CDC website is still in the top 30 side effects out of almost 4000 side effects. <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/VAERS.html">Re: wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html</a> over 2,300 have died from the vaccine already!</p>

        <p>I can't even find out if this Derek Knauss chap is a real person let alone a doctor. I've just shared the article with everyone I know but now I'm wondering if I've fallen for some misinformation. 'They were so convincing in their argument, they swung me!'</p>

&rt; over 2,300 have died from the vaccine already!</p>
<p>Come on, if you're going to start throwing out numbers at least try and understand what they are.  The very data you linked shows 2053 deaths reported to the system. The standard for reporting is that an event happens within a time period following the vaccination. The US was running about vaccinating a ton of elderly people in long-term care homes.. you know, people who are far more likely to die than a fit younger person and are far more likely to have other health issues.  Nowhere in VAERS does it require proof that the vaccine caused the result and the reports can be submitted by people with zero medical knowledge or training, family etc.  As of Apr 1 over 100 million Americans have had a dose.. 2035 is statistically insignificant, even without the mitigating factors.</p>
