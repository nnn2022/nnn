    <strong>Unintended Consequences</strong>
    <p><p>I'm currently renting a duplex apartment from my parents, who own the building but live elsewhere. They are looking to sell it, and I'm concerned about being forced to move. Not only am I content and comfortable where I'm living, but I'm also worried about the severe lack of housing available in my area. And it's not a lack of affordable housing... Just housing in general. There is literally nothing but Section 8 and 55+ living available within a 50 mile radius. </p>
<p>Before my parents can sell the house, they have to gain access to the upstairs for potential buyers to view. Upstairs tenant is being non-compliant, and despite working full time, claims to not be able to afford rent, having not paid rent for the past several months. Luckily for her, she is protected under Covid provisions. They are still trying to move forward with an eviction for a laundry list of other reasons</p>
<p>If the sale goes through, I could very well be forced to move out into the streets and be homeless, while the tenant who refuses to pay rent gets to continue to live upstairs at my parents expense. </p>
<p>By contrast, I work full time and pay my rent on time. I don't make excuses. And yet I'm the one who potentially gets screwed over.</p>
<p>So now I'm between a rock and a hard place. If the new owner wants to move into my apartment, do I become homeless, or do I lie and say I can't afford rent, effectively stopping me from being forced to move out?</p>
<p>EDIT - The people who refuse to pay rent would otherwise be on the streets, if it weren't for Covid regulations. This leads to a lack of available apartments for people who do pay their rent</p></p>

        <p>This whole thing has been so full of perverse incentives. Sorry you're going through that. It must be incredibly frustrating. I hope you can find a solution without having to lie.</p>

        <p>Yeah this sounds so unfair I would say you are absolutely morally justified to lie.
And I gotta say, your parents sound like fucking assholes for going through with this knowing the situation they're putting you in.</p>

        <p>I don't blame them honestly. I understand why they're doing it. My mom is not in such a good place, and my dad isn't getting any younger. It's a big weight that will be lifted off their shoulders</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that I will be forced out, but it is certainly a possibility</p>

        <p>heh, none of these consequences are unintended.</p>
<p>why don't you buy it from your parents?</p>
<p>the no evictions dictate only stops the actual eviction from occurring. the process can be started now, and when the eviction ban is lifted, your parents will have the order ready to go.</p>

        <p>I've thought about buying it from them, but I don't intend on staying in this state long enough to justify purchasing it. Also, I don't want the liability that my parents are trying to escape looming overhead</p>
