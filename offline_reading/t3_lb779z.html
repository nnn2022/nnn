    <strong>Notice how quickly debate with Pro Lockdowners turns into Name calling and proposing extreme hypotheticals when you highlight the bad side effects of lockdowns.</strong>
    <p><p>This is because they have no rational or logic based response to it and don’t want to admit that they were wrong about advocating for lockdowns. At that point you’ve won. You pointed out the side effects of the lockdowns and all they could respond with is name calling, claiming your data is Bs despite the evidence or proposing a extreme hypothetical where 10 million would’ve died without lockdowns so they were an necessary evil while also assuming that being anti lockdown means you deny Covid all together. </p>
<p>At best you’ll get them to acknowledge they support the idea that the government should be paying everyone. Of course only after they’ve belittled you for being concerned about your own survival and downplayed the issue of poverty itself . But once again that’s another hypothetical. When the reality is THE GOVERNMENT ISN’T and even if they were there are still economic issues in all the countries whose government took care of them. The reality is that people still have bills due and will have to pay them at some point. The reality is that the government has failed to adequately compensate the people they forced out of work . The reality is hardly any of these stay home/lockdown apologists are gonna about pay your bills.</p>
<p>Hell they don’t have to. At the very least just be a little more understanding of why people hate lockdowns instead of trying to strawman their arguments,downplay the damage, and ignore our concerns. Realize most anti lockdown acknowledge that Covid is real just think that other measures that don’t require fucking us and our friends/family need to be discussed. But we can’t have that consversation when y’all are gonna deny and strawman any lockdown arguments. </p>
<p>What’s gonna funny/sad some of you pro lockdowners are gonna come in these comments and make my point for me</p></p>

        <p>Reddit is full kids who don't have too much experience following an argument, a central point and a line of logic. Maybe it's worth leading the way and teaching them.</p>
<p>Then there's the crowd which is genuinely afraid, for their own health or of their close ones. You can't reason with fear. There's no point in continuing the discussion.</p>
<p>Finally, the rest are trolls. Just ignore them, down-vote and move on.</p>

        <p>I thinks its more of the emotions leading the arguments. When people are emotional/fearful/angry they are more likely to resort to name calling and hypotheticals. When angry, people need to direct that energy somewhere and it is usually to whatever is front of them that threatens their worldview. They're not all idiots, the emotions are getting in the way of thinking logically.</p>

        <p>I would agree with this but as a secondary factor, as all people have the capacity for such emotions, and not all respond that way (specifically those who are honest about the scam or simply ask valid questions and get attacked for it), it's not a result of emotions. </p>
<p>The emotional angry response is secondary - a result of having no logical argument or answer for their actions, as OP noted.  They cant respond, they are angry they cant, so they attack.  It's all they can do.  That or block/censor.</p>

        <p>The affects of lockdowns have obvious pros and cons. Locking down will cause the economy to suffer, no question about that. However, not closing the economy would be better for the economy, but more people will die from the virus. Whether you believe the virus is actually dangerous or not, we can all agree that people will die if we don’t lockdown. People will also die if there’s a lockdown, but it wouldn’t be as high (from the virus), and it would probably be more starvation related deaths. It’s a lose-lose situation. It’s honestly up to if we want the economy to stay up, or have more people die from the virus. No side is truly right or wrong.</p>
<p>Insulting the other side of the debate doesn’t get us anywhere. Even if a person was rude towards you, flashing how rude they were, and exclaiming how wrong their views are also doesn’t do anything constructive. Always try to be respectful, no matter what.</p>

        <p>Your whole argument is based on 1. There’s an actual novel Corona virus going around the planet killing everything in site. 2. The measures taken to mitigate this “threat” are justified because, more people would’ve died if we didn’t lockdown. Never, In the history of the world have we locked down heathy people, EVER. This virus has never been isolated and proven to exist anywhere on the face of the earth. Asymptomatic is NOT a thing. If you have said virus you present clinically. If you have said virus and don’t present clinically you are immune. You’ve cleared the virus and cannot spread it. The PCR test used to drive this narrative is 100% complete BS. It’s own creator said his test was never to be used as a diagnostic tool. There are no pros to locking down healthy people ZERO. This is a concerted and insidious effort to destroy what’s left of the middle class and small businesses. You can’t half see the picture anymore. If this needs pointing out here it is emphatically laid out for you. We cannot continue to see a nonexistent upside to this nonsense. There is none.</p>

        <p>Hey man. I understand what you’re saying, but that’s some pretty heavy misinformation. First off, Sars-Cov-2 is real. Idc how much you think the virus is dangerous or not, you can’t say it’s all fake. There’s been concrete evidence proving it’s existence, I’ve even had close friends that have gotten the novelty virus. Whether or not it’s actually super duper dangerous is still up to debate. Second, Being Asymptomatic is indeed real, and it’s not just for Sars-Cov-2. It’s most common with Influenza. Lastly, we have had lockdowns before that locked in healthy people. During the Middle Ages, many towns would isolate themselves from the sick, and quarantine home. In fact, many scientists believe that’s how they helped end the plague at the time. Even George Washington isolated his soldiers, to try and prevent them from getting smallpox from the diseased. During the outbreak of Influenza (1920) in the US, not wearing a mask was illegal, and socializing with people for no valid reason was also illegal. Most people were quarantined home, even if they weren’t sick. Saying that we’ve never had a lockdown with healthy people in history, or even in the US is just flat out wrong my guy. Not trying to sound rude or disrespectful, but please don’t spread misinformation. That’s the most dangerous thing in this world.</p>

        <p>Cite me one source that says someone has isolated this virus. You’re going to come back with 100 Google searches “saying” it’s been isolated and we have it. It’s getting tedious battling you Google search people. The CDC is the absolute last source I would trust with any of this. I wouldn’t build a sand castle with your “concrete evidence” your friends got normal, for this time of year viruses that have been co-opted and brought under the scary Corona virus umbrella. Cite me a credible source that explains why influenza suddenly vanished this year. Please stop saying that asymptomatic is real, it is not. You’re not sounding wrong or disrespectful you’re sounding ignorant and uninformed.</p>

        <p>Where’s your sources to back up your information? You already said that no matter what I show, you won’t believe it. Influenza did not disappear this year. Saying that is extremely ignorant my friend. Influenza is still around, but cases aren’t nearly as high this year because of the higher percentage of masks, and social distancing. Last time I checked, no “normal” viruses cause lost of taste as the most common symptom. I think you need to fact check yourself. Screaming “conspiracy!” At every thing involving the virus, or every credit source for the virus just makes you sound crazy dude. Not every government branch or country is trying to fake a pandemic... </p>
<p>https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/</p>
<p>This shows that the flu is still active, but like I said, it’s not nearly as high this year, due to Covid precautions.</p>

        <p>I said, don’t show me Google searches and it’s the first thing you do. Whatever. Let me use your own nonsense against you because there’s nothing more satisfying. The CDC document is titled, “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.” It is dated July 13, 2020. In that document, on page 42, in a section titled, “Performance Characteristics,” there’s this: “Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays [diagnostic tests] designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA…” plain English it means they don’t have the virus. The CDC doesn’t have the virus. There’s numerous FOI requests filed of multiple govt. agencies requesting documented proof of an isolated virus. Guess how many have complied with the documentation? Zero. No one is going to go on the record and hang themselves legally saying they have it. The flu did disappear, it’s amazing really. Again from the CDC, “The model used to generate influenza in-season preliminary burden estimates uses current season flu hospitalization data. Reported flu hospitalizations are too low at this time to generate an estimate.” Plain English, influenza cases are so insignificant they can’t bother tracking them. It beggars belief to say that flu numbers are almost nonexistent because of masking and social distancing. If we’re so compliant and brought the flu numbers down why hasn’t COVID stopped? I mean that’s the whole narrative right? This killer virus is decimating the world because we’re not masking enough and social distancing enough. Even Google will tell you there are multiple viruses that cause loss of taste and smell. No one is screaming conspiracy you’re quite adept at putting words in people’s mouths. You’re out of your depth here if all your going to do is go on Google and try and come at me with what you “researched” I’ve sat and read through these articles. I’ve done the real research. This is all bullshit and I’m quite furious with myself for entertaining you. You get all defensive because I called you ignorant and uninformed showing you clearly don’t even know the English language because it’s not an insult.</p>

        <p>“The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assays contained in the CDC 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019- nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel were determined in Limit of Detection studies. Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV were available for CDC use at the time the test was developed and this study conducted, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen. Samples were extracted using the QIAGEN EZ1 Advanced XL instrument and EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Cat# 62724) and manually with the QIAGEN DSP Viral RNA Mini Kit (Cat# 61904)”</p>
<p>Same page. They said they didn’t have the virus isolated for the test at the time. They then explained how they knew how to create the tests at the start of the pandemic, using the RNA data sent in from other labs (most likely from China). This is not them saying that the virus isn’t real man. If you continue to read the document, they constantly explain how they have the virus isolated now, and are continuing to perform tests. Also, again, you’re comparing the flu to Covid. While yes, both are corona viruses, they have many differences. For example, the flu is not nearly as contagious, and we already had a vaccine for it (whether or not it’s a good vaccine is up to debate). Flu vaccinations were through the roof this year, and with the masks and social distancing, it’s obvious why flu cases were at an all time low this year. Again, the flu didn’t magically disappear, I have no idea where you’re getting that assessment from. </p>
<p>Also, your debating makes no sense dude. I provide evidence for my claims, and you immediately tell me off on how I sent you stuff from google. Then you literally sent me a document that’s from google (as are 99% of articles and documents). Honestly, the hypocrisy from you is outstanding. I’m not trying to fight with you, and I don’t really know why you’re acting irrationally right now. If you respond again I’m just going to ignore it, since I have a life to live. I’ve already provided evidence to support my argument, and fight yours. You’ve hardly said anything constructive in this conversation.</p>
<p>With all that said, I do believe the virus is real. You don’t have to, but regardless, I do hope you stay safe. I wouldn’t wish any harm on people, even if they have opposite opinions than me. Stay safe, and have a great day.</p>

        <p>I do think we should have restrictions, but shouldn’t fully lockdown everything. Like you said, achieving a middle ground appears to be the best answer to this pressing problem. Keeping the economy stable, and lowering the spread of the virus at the same time is possible, but I’m not 100% sure we can do it. I just have hope that we can find a good solution that both sides can agree with.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns destroyed my life and literally took 5 years of busting my ass going from hourly to a nice salary to nothing. While I'm pleased you are at least open to civil debate...honestly?  FUCK YOU. You can't agree all people need the opportunity to not just survive but thrive <em>and</em> support lockdowns. Lockdowns take that ability away and it literally took that away from me, my wife and 3 year old son. Only reason you support lockdowns is because your income hasn't suffered.</p>
<p>Try having that same opinion when it causes you to lose everything like it did for me. People like you are taking food out of my family's mouth. Fuck you dude, fuck you.</p>

        <p>Wow. Look at how quickly that debate turned into swearing and personal attacks. Wasn’t that supposed to be what I am guilty of, as per the OP?</p>
<p>My income has been affected. </p>
<p>I support lockdowns because I live in a country that has far better income support and social support than it has the ability to increase health care capacity. </p>
<p>I don’t think we live in the same country. I’m not taking food out of your family’s mouth. Give me some way to contact you and I will send you a grocery gift card.</p>

        <p>He isn't the majority ignore his outburst, I think its great you're still doing well during this pandemic and am also personally doing just fine. I am absolutely against lockdowns though, strictly because people are going crazy and mental health is seriously suffering for a large portion of the population.</p>
<p>I have had 4 friends kill themselves during this last year (all age 20-30), some because they lost their jobs and homes, others because they got into drugs to try and stay entertained. I don't know of anyone who has died of covid, and plenty that have caught it. </p>
<p>This lockdown is essentially trading old lives for young lives, thats the one biggest thing that bothers me. If you look at the total deaths worldwide, from all causes and compare years we aren't that far ahead from 2018 and 2019. The difference here, we are financially ruining a huge percentage of people from the age of 20-40, a lot of these people will never recover. All of these people may live through the pandemic, but at what cost? Sure the older people (75+) will get an extra few years on the earth and thats great, but you are essentially ending 40+ years of prosperity from the vast majority of the young population. I get it, lives are more important than money.. but we live in a time where having money dictates how enjoyable and full your life will be.</p>
<p>There should not be any lockdowns, especially now that there's a vaccine. People deserve to choose how they want to live their lives. Everyone that supports a government mandated lockdown is anti choice, what's the saying? My body, my choice. Its a relevant saying in all sorts of rules and regulations, why now do people suddenly not agree with this?</p>
