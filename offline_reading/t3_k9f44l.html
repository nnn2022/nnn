    <strong>Wave of political crises: indirect lockdown protests?</strong>
    <p><p>What was not so evident this year is that the countries in which lockdowns caused severe consequences (starvation, illiteracy, economic depression etc) had political crises. We, skeptics, can make the dots, but was this massive wave of political crises not a lockdown protest under more "socially acceptable reasons":</p>
<p>1- Peru: The super-lockdown President Martin Vizcarra was impeached November 9th. The opposition "found out" his illicit deals with construction companies, as if they had not know before, and used these deals as a reason to impeach him. The Vice President, Manuel Merino,  was told that, if he stayed in office, he would be impeached too, so he resigned in November 15th, 5 days in office.</p>
<p>2- Israel: the massive Netanyahu protests that boiled over his second lockdown</p>
<p>3- France: the protests that took place last week about not filming police acts. There is footage that the protests were so violent that they put the riot police to run away.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I think we can make the dots, no?</p></p>
