    <p><p>Looking for hope! Any anecdotes, evidence, knowledge of history or psychology to support your opinion. Cynics: why do you disagree with the optimists? I think the cynics have some believable predictions but I am curious if their are lots of positive predictions.</p></p>

        <p>I'm somewhere in the middle. I think the government will likely be forced to relax restrictions only because of the pushback. </p>
<p>Right or wrong, there will be pushback. </p>
<p>People are tired of the restrictions especially because we're not seeing bodies in the streets. Do we want to see bodies in the streets? No. This definitely seems like a waiting game and most people do not want to get the vaccine at least as far as anecdotal evidence goes. 
An acquaintance of mine is quitting her job in the healthcare field because she does not want to be forced into the vaccine and the restrictions feel like a charade. </p>
<p>As well, PPE equipment is being reused, even in hospitals. At the very least we should be making more...this is America... we're supposed to be able to do these things. </p>
<p>People feel like they're being bamboozled. And maybe we are.</p>

        <p>People are already tired. My city today looked like a normal Black Friday. Traffic was insane. People aren’t staying home. Restaurants were packed inside and out. The parking lot yesterday for a restaurant that does thanksgiving meals/dine in was entirely full. So they’re already tired. The thing about restrictions in the US is that in places where basically everything is open, it’s kind of hard to make civil unrest happen ovyer it because we aren’t being stopped from socializing, businesses aren’t being kept closed &amp; almost every activity is allowed barring concerts although in my city they’re skirting that by basically offering block party style concerts at smaller venues. I’m basically able to enjoy everything I normally would enjoy. It’s hard to push when the vaccine arriving is the last basic push for everything to be entirely normal where I live. I can’t speak for other states, tho. That’s a different battle for them. </p>
<p>In terms of vaccines, I heard it posited like this: there’s no way to uniformly distribute vaccines all at once. It’s literally impossible. So they’ll be distributed to high risk groups first which will lower deaths and infections which will then render forced vaccines moot. Everyone looking at these death totals don’t comprehend that 42% of them are coming from LTC &amp; another large percentage is non-LTC elderly &amp; infirm. A LOT of these deaths were slated to happen this year or were deaths that normally would’ve happened in 2019. Deaths in 2019 were at a 5 year low. A lot of people lived longer than expected. They are now dying. A vaccine will once again lower those numbers. The same people screaming about old people dying are the same people who complain about over population and old people who take up resources. Why they now want to stop all death is beyond me but hysteria is a helluva drug.</p>
<p>The vaccine being released is final line in the sand for many many people currently still pushing for restrictions. 2 of my closest friends are major doomers who were germaphobes before all this and now it’s up to 100. But they’re also the type to say “jab me with this fucking vaccine so I can throw a party with 100 people at my house”. Like they literally plan to throw a huge ass party the minute they’re vaccinated. There is no wait and see for them. The vaccine is the hard and final line for them. My friend said he would burn down his entire state if they try to pull any additional shit after the vaccine. After reading a lot of threads in r/Coronavirus , I don’t believe my friend is alone. The vaccine just existing is a hard line for many people. Many many people. Everyone knows there’s nothing coming to save us after that. I don’t expect anyone to lay down quietly if shit attempts to be dragged out beyond a vaccine. That’s a whole ass bear the government should think long and hard about poking because a lot of people are ONLY playing by the rules because of a promise of the vaccine ending this bullshit existence. Gloves are off if it goes beyond that.</p>

        <p>You can't convince people without evidence that everyone is dying around them forever. Eventually more and more people are going to realize no one around them has died from this thing. It's like they're telling us it's raining outside. It's a deluge. And people are looking out their windows and the sun is shining and they're like huh? Well I guess the rain must be coming. But it doesn't come. And doesn't come. And doesn't come. And eventually they get sick of living in fear of the rain that never comes. Then they start to see all the insidious steps these weathermen have taken to keep them inside and afraid in spite of the fact that the damn rain never came.</p>

        <p>I have no idea what to think. I know people I work with were fairly lax about this early on, but seem to have really doubled down lately. One of my coworkers around June was saying they thought this was basically like the flu and they weren't that worried about it. Now, they wear masks all the time and said they even plan to keep wearing them after experts say we don't need to.</p>
<p>Two other guys at my job who used to be huge muscular and went to the gym literally every day, have not been a single time since April. They don't seem to be in much of a hurry to get back either. One of them I remember said they kept getting told they needed to wear a mask at the gym early on in this, but they didn't want to, said there's an agenda behind them, etc.</p>
<p>Now? This same guy has started wearing a mask all day at work, keeps his door shut with a sign up that you must knock to enter, and even keeps it shut when he's not at work?</p>
<p>Yeah, it seems early on people who thought this was just a joke or some conspiracy are now doubling down.</p>
<p>In my area there isn't much pushback. Everything is basically open - restaurants, stores, theaters, etc. The only things we can't do right now are large events and stuff like that. I think the Christmas parades got cancelled back in the summer and a lot of people were upset.</p>
<p>But since my state is opened up, and we can do most stuff, people don't really give much thought to the rest of the restrictions such as masks and social distancing.</p>
<p>I'm hoping a vaccine will end this, but if the goalposts get moved to "well everyone in the world has to get a vaccine before it's 100% safe to take off your masks and stop all the restrictions," I really think the same people who are waiting on a vaccine will just pivot to that. Because most of them don't think having to wear a mask is a big deal.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure if there would be much pushback if we were told to wear masks and social distance permanently. Just the people that don't even seem to care about going to the gym for almost a year, who that was their whole hobby, make it seem this way, to me.</p>
<p>OTOH, I think people are going to be pretty mad if they have to give up a whole second summer, Thanksgiving and Christmas if it comes to that. But also, they can still do those things, and do them under the radar if need be. So I'm not sure there would even be much public opposition to them wanting us to keep this up for another year.</p>
<p>I didn't go out for Black Friday so I can't say what things were like in town, but I know our neighbors had people over as normal.</p>

        <p>&rt; I'm hoping a vaccine will end this, but if the goalposts get moved to "well everyone in the world has to get a vaccine before it's 100% safe to take off your masks and stop all the restrictions," I really think the same people who are waiting on a vaccine will just pivot to that. Because most of them don't think having to wear a mask is a big deal.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask <em>isn't</em> a big deal in itself, it's the precedent it sets for getting idiots to militantly promote unchecked submissiveness to the state, at a time where the media appears to be salivating over the idea of requiring people to vaccinate to engage in society. Totally normal, in a time of insane media fear mongering just sign me up to be a Guinea pig for the pharmacutical companies please</p>
<p>House arrest, muzzles, coerced vaccines, has everyone gone mad? I feel like I'm in an alternate universe</p>
