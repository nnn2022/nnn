    <strong>Nuremberg Code Violation?</strong>
    <p><p>Since the vaccine is still in trial phase, wouldn't the government be breaking the Nuremberg Code if they force you to get the vaccine in order to work, travel, shop, etc?  Also, couldn't you sue your employer if they force you to get the vaccine, along with the medical professional that gave you the vaccine, since part of the Nuremberg Code states that you must be a willing participant in any medical trials?</p></p>

        <p>Yes, they are blatantly violating the Nuremberg Code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"the person involved [in experimentation] should have legal capacity to give consent; should be so situated as to be able to exercise free power of choice, without the intervention of any element of force, fraud, deceit, duress, over-reaching, or other ulterior form of constraint or coercion; and should have sufficient knowledge and comprehension of the elements of the subject matter involved as to enable him to make an understanding and enlightened decision." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment.”  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.”</p>
</li>
</ul>

        <p>People will start arguing that social pressure and business deciding to close their doors to you isn't duress, force etc. but just a free business decision. And the EHRC's ruling today will make them feel vindicated.</p>

        <p>I'm all for private businesses being able to turn customers away for any reason, but private businesses absolutely have no right to ask for private medical information.  HIPAA should be upheld.  I know there will be businesses that fight, but I hope that there are some lawyers out there willing to take on these blatant HIPAA violation cases.  It makes me happy to see some states taking a stand against these "passports".  Let's hope more states stand against it.</p>

<p>Businesses (other than insurance companies and healthcare providers) aren't bound by HIPAA when dealing with customers.</p>
<p>With any luck and a few daring legislators, they <em>will</em> be one day, but as of now, they aren't.</p>

        <p>I wish I had the answer.  I was pointing this out because so many people are totally ok with vaccine passports, and have not given a second thought to our civil rights, the Nuremberg Code, and how it appears that we are sadly headed in the same direction of nazi Germany.  I'm not even a big history buff, but this smells distinctly of our past during the time of Hitler.  Human rights violations are coming in a big way.</p>

        <p>Absolute insanity!  People don't understand that those of us that are not willing to participate in a clinical trial of a rushed vaccine typically 100% support a person's individual choice to participate.  In fact, we NEED people to volunteer for the vaccines.  My argument is that it should NEVER be forced participation.  The government is not physically forcing the vaccine..yet, but it is force when the government says, "you don't HAVE to get the vaccine, we are not forcing you.  You just will not be able to travel, work, buy food, or run a business without it.". THAT IS forced vaccination: starve or get the shot.  That is terrifying, and I honestly feel it is coming very soon.  We already have people turning in friends, family, and neighbors for not complying with the government lockdowns.  History is repeating itself.  The German people thought they were being good citizens by turning in their neighbors for non-compliance with the Nazis.  It is reprogramming, and it is horrifying to see this on repeat. 😕</p>
<p>Edit:  The Nuremberg trials laid the foundation for BASIC human rights.  Anyone who laughs at that or the Nuremberg Code is absolutely a fucking moron.</p>

        <p>I'll never, ever wonder again, "How could that happen? How could people comply?" because I am seeing it right now. I just have no idea why I am on this side of the debate, and not the other one. I think the others are less miserable, to be honest.</p>

        <p>It's a non-starter, unfortunately, just like the HIPAA argument.</p>
<p>The guy at Wal-Mart probably thinks the Nuremberg Code is something you do to get infinite extra lives in <em>Castle Wolfenstein</em>, and if he doesn't want you in the store, no amount of international law from decades ago is going to change his mind.</p>
<p>Myself?  I <em>pray</em> that someone challenges this in court and wins using the Nuremberg Code as precedent, but the hand I'm praying into isn't filling up nearly as fast as the one I'm shitting in.</p>

        <p>Here are my thoughts: I think that is exactly the stance thegovernment &amp; people who support HIPPA violations are hoping we will all take.  If we all think we will lose before the race starts, then noone will fight.  Stand strong in your beliefs.  Hell, if a burglar can sue a homeowner if he gets hurt while robbing your house, I think I can sue a business for HIPPA violations.  😀💪🦄</p>
