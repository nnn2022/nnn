    <strong>I believe in masking and vaccine. I don't believe that we can't return to the old normal, and I think the variants are a façade.</strong>
    <p><p>I do think that the COVID-19 pandemic is real, and we saw what happened last year. I mask up, wash my hands and maintain a safe distance. When our country opens vaccinations for people under 18, I'll gladly take it.</p>
<h1>The New Normal Narrative</h1>
<p>One popular narrative that the large media houses of the world have been peddling is "there is no old normal anymore". The NYT did a "survey", where they claimed that a majority of New Yorkers believe that the new normal is here to stay. </p>
<p>I disagree. If the "new normal" was here to stay, the 1960s Asian Flu epidemics, or even the SARS epidemics of the early 2000s would've radically changed us. We would've been wearing masks. Yet, post the control of these epidemics, only a few months passed and our concerts with a maximum seat limit of 70,000 had 100,000 spectators.</p>
<p>This is because unlike the seasonal flu, or any other such disease, a pandemic is an exacerbated acute disease. I'm not a doctor, but as far as I know, if you stop the contagiousness of something, you can go back to normal.</p>
<p>When you have a stomachache, a doctor will advise you temporary advice on diet and medication. You aren't supposed to take that medicine and eat only jam for the rest of your life, if I'm not wrong?</p>
<p>I think this is the same for the COVID-19 pandemic. While it should be tackled, we shouldn't be gearing up for permanently adapting for it. Instead of treating it as a curse that will harm us for eternity, we should instead tackle it as a short war.</p>
<p>Again, I don't believe I'm not dining without a mask two years later.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>The Variants For The Vaccine</h1>
<p>Now, I support the vaccination drives. I think it is important that immunization happens in citizen against a threat. I do understand that there are side effects, which, some people may be thrown off by, and they should be encouraged and not forced towards the vaccine.</p>
<p>What I don't believe in is exaggeration through novelty. By showing us a new "Delta" or "Lambda" variant, what is happening is fearmongering. It is a textbook recipe for failure, especially during times of failure.</p>
<p>And - if the vaccine isn't effective on these new "variants", work on it. Small spikes in the protein of the virus are shown as if they are threats to humanity, to distract people and create fear. I think it is all a psychological ploy in direction of big pharma.</p>
<p>Voluntary participation is a concept largely ignored in these variants. Hence, I believe in the non-existence or exponential exaggeration of the variants.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>I'd like to just share that this pandemic is not just about protection or caution - it is about not being reckless while still being brave.</p></p>

        <p>If you think they plan to return to normal you have not been paying attention..</p>
<p>The 'vaccine' isn't produced like a vaccine, it doesn't work like a vaccine, and it doesn't protect like a vaccine. Add to that no long term data, AND it's on record that they stopped animal trials of the mRNA vax because when introduced to the wild virus the animals died. </p>
<p>The cheap treatments they are suppressing could have ended this a year ago. They haven't done widespread hcq+zinc trials because if hcq had on label treatment of covid they'd never get emergency use auth for these notvaccines. </p>
<p>Masks are just symbolism. It's a joke they would make this public mandate. All ordered by the world economic forum with bribes (covid support payments in exchange for masks and lockdowns)</p>

        <p>I'm  perfectly healthy. Nothing reckless about that fact.</p>
<p>What is truly reckless are people making decisions based on fear and suspicion, and the inability to take responsibility for themselves and their own safety - and support draconian measures against EVERYONE ELSE to ensure their own need for a safe space.</p>
