        <p>we used to be so even-keeled and well-balanced. a nice smattering from the right, and a nice smattering from the left. but at some point in the 2000s, we took a hard right turn, and i firmly believe that's why we are where we are now - we've over-corrected to the left. Virginia used to be a really purple state, with more liberal areas in Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads, and Richmond, but firmly conservative areas in central and southwestern Virginia. now, the red-blue polarization is striking and perplexing.</p>
<p>the Democrats are squandering a lot of good will right now by pandering to the worst whims and desires of the blue primary base. but those D primary voters - just like R primary voters - are really out of touch and out of step with ordinary people. if the Democrats continue to overcorrect and impose woke-will from the top, the people in Virginia have a tendency to snap back and immediately vote for the Republicans in the next election. i can already see this happening even in the people's republic of Northern Virginia where many of us are quiet about being anti-lockdown in public, and while we previously voted blue, we have no issues voting red because we want to right the ship. political moderates in Virginia are just very mellow about it. we can't all be Patrick Henry, lol - some of us are George Washington.</p>
<p>i don't want to leave (even if i am only occupying southern territory) - this is our home too. we don't have to let this happen. what we need to do is vote local, vote often, and vote smart. vote for the candidate you really think is the best for your area and the Commonwealth. don't vote straight down the party line - pick and choose. make 'em work for your ballot. i'm going to vote my conscience for the future of the Commonwealth. don't give up yet.</p>

        <p>Where have masks actually prevented spread? We've had mandatory masks for months in plenty of places through out the world, so this data should be easy for you to provide. I am yet to see any data that supports masks being effective at slowing the spread of the disease. I hear bold claims that they work and it's been proven, but no supporting data.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the welcoming discussion. What exactly are you asking for? What would satisfy you, evidence wise, that mask wearing is effective at limiting the spread of an airborne pathogen?</p>
<p>This is a wide ranging article that covers many mask related concerns, with studies backing their benefits and explanations behind the seemingly ever changing recommendations: https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/06/417906/still-confused-about-masks-heres-science-behind-how-face-masks-prevent</p>
<p>This published paper also analyzes the situation: https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00818 </p>
<p>Alternatively, you seem convinced that they don't work. Where is that evidence?</p>

        <p>So here's the problem, both of your links you provided are from mid June. This is a problem because mid June is when most mask mandates were started. Most places had not mandated masks until after these articles were even written. Yet they were already claiming that mask mandates worked. The only place that had mask mandates in the US pre June was the North East. But the mask mandates in the northeast were basically pointless. Take <a href="http://imgur.com/a/7Jcmo6j">New York</a> for example. New York's cases peaked on April 10th, but their mask mandate didn't go into effect until April 17th. New York's cases peaked and declined without the help of people wearing masks. If masks did have an impact, the data should reflect that, and the case trajectory should have changed showing an decrease in the rate of new cases. But this is not what happened. Cases declined, and continued declining at the same rate. Masks made no difference. </p>
<p>California issued a statewide mask mandate on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/18/880583357/california-gov-newsom-makes-face-masks-mandatory-amid-rising-coronavirus-cases">June 18</a>. And some places like Los Angeles County had mask mandates in effect since <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/05/l-a-county-coronavirus-update-public-health-director-says-masks-are-in-fact-mandatory-across-the-entire-county-1202935226/">May 14.</a> So you would think that cases would slow down in California, but that's not what happened. <a href="https://imgur.com/dZVhEwi">Here</a> is the daily new cases chart from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/california/">worldometers</a>. It clearly shows that mask mandates have not led to a slow in the spread of the virus. In fact, the opposite happened. As masks were mandated, cases began to rise at a more rapid rate. After the statewide mandate, cases dramatically increased for over a month until it peaked on July 25th. If masks were effective, you would expect at the least a flattening of the curve. But this did not happen. What is also interesting is that Los Angeles County accounts for nearly half of all of California's <a href="https://imgur.com/ky2V0gh">deaths</a>, and they have had a mask mandate in place since mid May. And this <a href="https://imgur.com/PNjQIHP">map</a> from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html">New York Times</a> shows that California, and the LA area are very compliant when it comes to mask wearing. Mask wearing has not been effective in California.</p>
<p>The same thing happened in Florida. While there is no statewide mask mandate, most of the largest cities in the state (Miami, Tampa, Orlando) implemented mask mandates by <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/06/19/major-florida-cities-now-require-use-of-face-mask-in-public-places/">June 19th.</a> Yet after the mandates, cases continued to rise for nearly a month, finally peaking on <a href="https://imgur.com/48pabWz">July 13.</a> And in similar fashion, the curve wasn't flattened at all, on the contrary, the rate of new cases increased after mask mandates were implemented. Mask wearing has not been effective in Florida.</p>
<p>Texas has a similar story. While a statewide mask mandate was issued on July 3rd, the largest cities (<a href="https://patch.com/texas/irving-tx/dallas-county-judge-issues-order-requiring-face-masks">Dallas</a>, <a href="https://houstonse.org/blog/harris-county-new-mask-order/">Houston</a>, <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=342433">Austin</a>, <a href="https://www.bexar.org/3234/COVID-19">San Antonio</a>) all implemented mask mandates around June 22. Yet after this mandate, cases continued to increase regardless, finally peaking almost a month later on <a href="https://imgur.com/qUuLpYw">July 16</a>. Mask wearing has not been effective in Texas.</p>
<p>The same thing can be said for Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Virginia. All of these places implemented mask mandates, yet cases continued to increase regardless. And this is not just an American thing. The same thing has been observed around the world. Spain, France, Belgium, Peru, The Philippines, Argentina, and countless other nations implemented strict mask mandates, only to have cases to continue to increase. And then you have places like Scandinavia, which didn't impose masks at all, yet had similar results (Sweden) or better (Denmark, Norway, Finland). When you compare <a href="http://imgur.com/a/TAhbmWd">Sweden</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/dKeWa4B">Michigan </a>,  two places with around 10 Million people and 1 major metro area, you'll see that they both peaked and declined. The difference is Sweden didn't lock down or mandate masks. Michigan mandated masks on June 18 and had a strict lock down. But after Michigan imposed its mask mandate, cases continued to steadily increase for the next 2 months. Michigan also ended up with a thousand more deaths and many more total cases. </p>
<p>The data is overwhelming that mask wearing does not slow the spread of covid. Nearly every place where it has been tried has not resulted in reduced case numbers or even a flattened trajectory. The links you posed reference some studies. Studies are fine and good, but you can find studies on both sides of the argument. <a href="https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy">Here</a> is an article that lists multiple studies showing that masks don't work. I don't share this as conclusive proof of masks not being effective. I share it just to emphasize the fact that there is no scientific consensus on the subject. But in the end, real world data should always trump limited studies. And at this point we have real world data, and it does not support the idea that masks are effective at slowing the spread of this virus.</p>

        <p>If that's all true, we have to ask why.</p>
<p>We know that masks, worn properly, are effective at significantly reducing localized distribution of aerosolized particles from the wearer and intake of particles from the environment.</p>
<p>If they weren't, they wouldn't be used in industry and hospitals. So where is the failure? Can we isolate mask use in those statistics and trajectories you've quoted? It's far more complicated than "mask mandate, therefore if there's no reduction, they were a failure."</p>
<p>That's like saying that since we have the level of infection that we do, we shouldn't have bothered distancing or locking down at all, when we know from centuries of experience that that works. We just did a shit job of it in the west.</p>

        <p>You are making bad assumptions. </p>
<p>What kind of masks? What do you consider worn properly? What do you consider significant? What do you consider localized? What kind of particles are you talking about?</p>
<p>What you say that "we know" is extremely vague, and not actually settled in the least. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy">studies</a> that contradict what you think we know. You are assuming things that aren't actually true or proven.</p>
<p>Masks are used by medical professionals in a hospital setting to prevent bacterial spread, not viral spread. If you read any if the studies I posted, you will see that it's pretty clear that masks are not effective at preventing viral spread. That was never their intention. That is not why medical professionals wear them. This is fairly obviously knowing the sizes of viruses compared to bacteria and how they function. And how masks are used in a medical setting is wildly different to how masks are used in the general public. I'm fairly confident surgeons aren't picking up a cotton mask from the gas station, heading into work, performing some surgeries, then rolling it up, putting it in their pocket, heading to Walmart, putting it back on, picking up some snacks, putting it back in their pocket, heading back to the hospital, putting that mask back on, and performing some more surgeries. Yet that is how masks are used in public. Any success seen by medical professionals with masks has more to do with the fact that they use high quality masks (not repurposed old t shirts or bandanas), they are trained how to properly use them and effectively fit them to their faces, they don't keep using old, dirty, used masks, they are constantly washing their hands and maintaining high levels of personal hygiene (that they have been professionally trained to do), and they are working in a sterile environment that is constantly being cleaned with specialized cleaners all day long. Comparing how masks are used in a medical setting by medical professionals to how they are used in the general public by average people is pretty ridiculous. And masks used in industry are definitely not used to prevent viral spread. They are used to block large (compared to a virus) dust particles. Your assumption of why masks are used in hospitals and industry is incorrect.</p>
<p>How else do you propose we determine whether mask wearing has been effective? If masks are effective that should be reflected in the numbers. If wearing masks dose not show any impact in the reduction in the spread of the virus, why should they be mandated? You are assuming mask wearing being effective at reducing viral spread in a public setting is a foregone conclusion. But this assumption is not supported by the science or the data that we have where mask wearing has been implemented. It's a cop out to claim that it's too complicated to be able to determine whether mask usage is effective from the numbers. And it's completely absurd to feel like determining the effectiveness of mask usage in the actual numbers is too complicated, but then completely trust limited studies with questionable methods or relevance and computer models that have been shown to be wildly inaccurate. And then to choose to base policies on the theoretical studies filled with tons of uncertainty and very little agreement, over actual, real world, in practice, data, is utter madness. </p>
<p>Also your claim that lock downs have been proven to work through centuries of experience is 100% not true, since never in history have humans ever locked down like we did this year. Its totally unprecedented. And in all honesty, did lock downs actually work? I guess it depends on how you define "work". If you look at most places with the highest death tolls, you will see that they all locked down. There is no link between lock down measures and better covid outcomes (fewer cases, hospitalizations, deaths). Japan is a great example of a place with a minimal lock down, and very few deaths. And where common mask wearing didn't have any noticeable impact on their recent spike in cases. Sweden is another place that had no real lock down and no mask mandates, yet has ended up with similar or better outcomes than places that locked down hard and mandated masks. And then when you factor in the actual cost and long term ramifications of the lock downs, I find it impossible to claim that lockdowns were in any way "successful". The data doesn't support it. Common sense doesn't support it. I think you need to reevaluate your assumptions.</p>

        <p>Their summary is flat out wrong and doesn't reflect the study.</p>
<p>They had one model that predicted infection and showed that <strong>number of adult contacts</strong> was a significant factor.</p>
<p>Then they made a second model that predicted number of adult contacts. It's only in this model that wearing a mask was a risk factor for <strong>higher number of contacts not infection.</strong></p>
<p>So wearing a mask made people more likely to ignore social distancing and other things that help to prevent spread.</p>

        <p>No, you're misrepresenting what they're saying. They're saying <strong>masks increase the rate of infection</strong>.       </p>
<p>Their hypothesis is that it <em>may be due to behavioral causes</em> and that, <em>"Further research into the effectiveness of marks and behavioral responses to 
mask mandates is urgently needed."</em></p>
<p>The text in italics is key, cause it shows yet again that there's no conclusive research proving mask  effectivenes.       </p>
<p>Besides, a false sense of security (and the lack of traning) in average citizens is a direct effect from wearing a mask and should have been absolutely accounted for in the policies cause it has a big role in its effectiveness in case that masks actually work in lab research enviroments.</p>
