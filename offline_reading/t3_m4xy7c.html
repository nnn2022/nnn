    <strong>Just because I'm not willing to be a guinea pig doesn't mean I'm anti-vax</strong>
    <p><p>You don't have to be anti something to be legitimately concerned about the safety and efficacy of a consumer product that you are considering putting inside your body. Being concerned about the mercury levels in fish doesn't make someone anti fish. Being concerned about glyphosate on your food, or heavy metals in your vegetables doesn't make you anti food. Being concerned about pollution in your drinking water doesn't make you anti water. Big Pharma has created a label and socially engineered society to attack people critical of a product they don't even have legal liability for damages on. According to Canadian virologists, it takes a minimum of 10 years to develop a vaccine that is safe for distribution and that has gone through all the proper trial stages. There are too many risks in untested vaccines. And even if they test them thoroughly, it's still too short of a time period. What if the effects are delayed? You get the vaccine and then get some form of cancer in a few years. Or makes you barren. </p>
<p>Don't forget that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782271/">the polio vaccine took 20 years to develop and get approved, according to the World Journal of Virology</a>.</p></p>

        <p>I'll go a step further and say that the charade with COVID has made me a lot more skeptical about the extent to which they push vaccinations as a whole. Also reading about debacles with the measles vaccine, HPV vaccine etc. I'm quite convinced there is toxicity in the contents of many vaccines, and would not agree to vaccinate my child unless it was absolutely necessary. If you're going to vaccinate, it had better be for something damn serious (e.g. smallpox or polio). And even there frankly, people underestimate the influence deplorable living conditions (lack of adequate nutrition, clean water, sanitation) etc. have on the transmission of those diseases, which vaccination by itself does nothing to address, as well as the importance of the immune system (far and away the centerpiece for health).</p>

        <p>Whenever the pro-vax lobby wants to show how great their jabs are, they'll typically show a graph showing the decline of polio, smallpox, whooping cough, TB, etc since vaccines were produced. What they won't do is to stretch out the timeline further to show that the decline began with the Industrial Revolution and that the vax-era only account for a tiny fraction of the decline in preventable diseases. </p>
<p>It's hilarious how the pro-vax lobby can tell you that organomercury, organoaluminium, etc are 'safe' when in vaccines but simultaneously tell you that mercury-dense fish and aluminium cookware should be avoided. #ScIeNcE!</p>

        <p>The vaccine rabbit hole is deep. It's not just the safety of them thats up for debate, it's also the effectiveness. There is quite a bit of evidence that suggests many of those diseases were declining prior to the introduction of their vaccines. Believed to be due to engineering advancements in sewage management, access to better nutrition and the like. I for one will never get another vaccine in my life, nor will my kids in the future. They use the same fear based tactics for those vaccines that they're using for this one. How many unvaccinated children do you know who have died of polio or measles?</p>

        <p>There are a couple of people I just stopped talking to about it because they insist that <em>the only</em> reason for any of the declines was vaccines, and without vaccines we'd be at 18th-century levels of mortality. Completely ignoring other factors. I'm willing to believe that they were <em>a</em> reason for the decline of certain illnesses, working alongside improvements in sanitation, nutrition, hygiene, and medical treatment for when you do get sick. It makes no sense to think that a well-fed, hygienic population who can go to Walgreens and get meds easily would have the same health outcomes as people who are starving with parasite problems and few to no meds available.</p>

        <p>When I was a kid I almost died from vaccinations. I'm not sure how much weight the argument has for adult bodies, this was when I was very young. But yeah no way am I vaccinating any kids if I have them before they're 18.</p>

        <p>If a medical treatment was being studied and found to kill rabbits, would it would be a good idea to take that as a human? Of course that argument holds weight for adults my dude.

        <p>Good point and all love as well. Haven't really put much thought into my personal stance before as I just kinda kept quiet and didn't take them. Let others do what they wanted. But now everyone's trying to shame or force you to get this jab so I'm trying to be more vocal. I agree, it's like  Stockholm Syndrome to me. You could put a nuke in front of some of these people and say "light it to get rid of covid" and they would.</p>

        <p>My wife argues "Oh well, there's mercury in everything".</p>
<p>To which I go "Yeah. But there's a difference between eating something and injecting it. If someone puts a gun to your head and says take this ounce of paint and either drink it or inject it. Which are you going to choose"?</p>
<p>Exactly. We'd drink it because we'd probably survive it and who knows what would happen if we injected it. So it goes with injecting mercury and aluminum and genetically modified organisms.</p>

<p>I never used to but doctors and I think it was a bout of flu that caused my ME/CFS. Even a cold can knock me out for a week or more let alone getting the flu again.</p>

        <p>Vaccines are so safe and effective, the government has made it unlawful to sue vaccine manufacturers for the damage the vaccines cause.</p>
<p>It's allegedly to make the vaccines cheap... except they're not cheap, they're HEAVILY subsidized in addition by the government. So the result is pharma gets rich and has no liability while John Q Taxpayer and the Fed pick up the tab for the damage they cause.</p>
<p>They're so safe and effective, they haven't been approved anywhere in the world. Except people swear up and down they're still safe and effective... well if that's the case, why in the fuck do we force other medications to go through some long, expensive process to prove they're safe and effective if that process doesn't actually increase safety or effectiveness ?</p>

But lining up to give the govment a vein once a year just to reduce the symptoms of a sickness that will likely pass after a week of discomfort, making my immune system that much stronger, don’t seam smart to me.</p>

        <p>Flu shots do not work.. and they most certainly will make your conditions worse in the long run. There are soooo many natural alternatives to a flu shot man. High quality zinc / vitamin C supplement, elderberry syrup, chaga mushroom tea, raw garlic/onions, raw honey, staying hydrated with fresh juices, lemon water, Thyme tea antiviral. None of which have mercury in them. I wish you the best.</p>

        <p>If it was gardasil, it's one of the worst vaccines you can get. It has ruined the health of many many women.. though the internet tries to bury their stories. I'm saying this because you said "at least that one was porperly tested." I'm glad you're ok, but these things accumulate in your body and can cause problems down the line.</p>

        <p>You’re right and I appreciate the concern. I guess it’s one of those things I won’t know about until it happens.</p>
<p>I remember my friends sister got it a couple years later and it made her extremely sick. She ended up fine but her reaction was bad.</p>

        <p>So you quote the science when it works for your narrative, but what about the science that explains why we were able to come up for a vaccine so quickly, or the fact that it did go through the 3 phases of testing? The obvious fact that scientific advances means we can do things quicker than previously, we didn't have to reinvent the wheel for the mRNA vaccine. Also since it doesn't affect your DNA, it's illogical to think it can cause DNA mutations, that's like saying putting tires on your car will cause engine failure.</p>
