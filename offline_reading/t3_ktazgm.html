    <strong>Banned from r/worldnews</strong>
    <p><p>R/worldnews have just posted a link to the bbc saying that a third vaccine has been agreed for use in the uk.</p>
<p>I posted the following and was PERMA banned. What in the hell?</p>
<p>Still.....</p>
<p>Why get a vaccine for a virus that most healthy people survive (from any government website that shows death statistics), that hasnt been tested, that doesnt prevent transmission (from Pfizer themselves) and will probably need to be topped up every 6 months (from Matt Hancock himself)</p>
<p>Oh yeah it's to waste money like every few years when the next big thing comes out... </p>
<p>How much money did the uk spend on Ebola jabs, swine flu jabs.... neither were needed but boy did we stockpile that...</p>
<p>And here we are a few years later and enough proverbial excrement has been thrown at the wall something has stuck and for some reason everyone has lost their mind over it.... </p>
<p>Average age of death..... 80
Chances of dying if under 55... ridiculously low
Chances of dying if under 55 with no health issues.... practically none.</p>
<p>Depression is rife.
Suicides are up.
Debt is up.
People are scared to go for necessary surgery/appointments</p>
<p>Then boris the utter see you next tuesday has the audacity to tell people like me (who are not conspiracy theorists but can see all of this I've typed above) to grow up.</p>
<p>The government has never and will never have YOUR best interest in mind... just money and control. We are all modern day slaves and we cant do anything about it.</p>
<p>Dont get a vaccine for something your immune system can and will fight off... if you do, this will continue to happen over and over again. Think logically. </p>
<p>Think how many people you know, same age, same health who have had it and how all of them are fine...( I realise there are extreme outliers and honestly it's so sad but they are just that)</p>
<p>Everyone is happily giving their rights and freedoms up for nothing. I'm all for protecting the vulnerable so we should do just that.</p>
<p>I dont wear a tin foil hat, I dont believe in lizard people, I do see facts as above, I do see real life experiences. (Anecdotal evidence is evidence when everyone you know in the real world NOT REDDIT has the same experiences.)</p>
<p>I dont believe there are microchips but if you cant see what I have written above for what it is, your either blind, a liar, naive or on here to deliberately negate points like this.</p>
<p>Look at the videos surfacing of a 92 year old man being arrested for 'being in breach of covid regulations'whatever the hell they are.
A Scottish family attacked in their own home by police because some curtain twitcher lied about them... is this really what you want for you, your family and this country?</p>
<p>Good luck everyone but seriously dont keep buying into this. A vaccine is not what is needed. It's the opposite, we need to stop feeding this monster.. refuse the vaccine, take off your mask. things will go back to normal when the government say so either way.</p></p>

        <p>actually. I got some responses eventually. As follows</p>
<p>Please. If you are going to ban me. Can you explain why? I have offered an opinion that, yes goes against what everyone is saying but is based on facts, experiences and real conversations.</p>
<p>Just as everyone has a right to push a vaccination surely other people have a right to recommend against it?</p>
<p>[–]subreddit message via /r/worldnews[M] sent an hour ago
Nope. You have no rights here, this is a privately owned and operated community and we are showing you the door, because you are promoting information that is hugely dangerous during the biggest public health emergency of our lifetimes.</p>
<p>[–]to /r/worldnews sent 40 minutes ago
It's not about rights. It's about freedom of speech. World news should be about both sides. Just because you say so, doesnt mean that what I have said is dangerous. It's not. It's just a different view. In the past, that's what news was. Un biased Information. What you are doing is forcing people one way and not allowing any other opinion. There is no health emergency and you know it.</p>
<p>I'm actually gutted you have acted in this absolutely disgusting way for putting my opinion out there. But hey, I'm sure you wont lose any sleep over it</p>
<p>[–]subreddit message via /r/worldnews[M] sent 33 minutes ago
There is no both sides. There is the correct side, and the side that dies cold and afraid without their family being able to see them for a week while being intubated.</p>
<p>[–]to /r/worldnews sent 20 minutes ago
No. Absolutely not. There is always two sides but you enjoy your pedestal. People are dying alone and afraid because they are not able to see their family. You should not censor speech. Unless its hate speech obv</p>

<p>I've had a number of these conversations recently and they NEVER end well. This person hasnt muted me which is a massive thing tbh.</p>
