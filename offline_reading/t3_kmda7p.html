    <strong>I just realized something...</strong>
    <p><p>Many of you already thought about this but Trump apparently lost the election and now the media has nothing but covid to fall back on. Because Trump was on the news 99% of the time and now its covid on the news 99% of the time. This covid tyranny will never end unless theres something new and bigger. Sorry to make this political, I don’t care if you hate the guy or like him. Or somewhere in between like me. You can’t deny Trump was on the news 24/7 and countless articles, posts, etc about him online. They have nothing now so they just repeatedly report on anything covid related. CNN apparently was or is being desperately sold off after the election, even the owners understand they aren’t real news.</p></p>

        <p>Theyre gonna miss him when hes gone. He was the greatest thing to happen to the country no matter who you are. </p>
<p>The left loves to hate him. Their collective hatred of him was one of the only unifying things the DNC had. </p>
<p>The MSM got huge ratings just on Trump-hatred alone. Now theyre gonna cover a bumbling senile man reading off a teleprompter <em>yawn</em> or read off flubbed covid statistics <em>yawn</em></p>
<p>Though. I wouldnt give Trump up just yet. Guy writes in every book to never give up. Hes unconventional and has comeback from bankruptcy multiple times in business. If 2020 has taught us anything its that anything can happen</p>

        <p>He's a goddamn war criminal just like the ones before him. A fucking puppet nothing more. He's done exactly what he was meant to do. Biden will fuck it up more and people will still believe in the two party illusion blindly thinking an external savior will fix things. I really wish people would see Trump has the power to end this, always has, but will not because this is exactly how the elite want this to play out. Seriously people need to wake up.</p>

        <p>What war crimes? He brought new peace accords, destroyed ISIS, and is pushing to get all troops out of afghanistan/iraq. If he was a puppet he would be in for 2 terms without question. Idk, what stuff your reading but it seriously has gaping flaws in it. </p>
<p>Gonna need to see some evidence to convince me, wild TDS style accusations not convincing at all.</p>

        <p>Peace accords, lol. Those countries were already working with Israel regularly, it was just unofficial. Israel and Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been cozy for several decades now if you paid attention. The shit going on in Yemen, which is by far the worst humanitarian crises in the M.E., is fueled by the 350 billion dollar weapons deal with Saudi Arabia which is directly tied to the Trump Administration. Another war crime, and what's fucked up is you and the whole world look the other way, smh.</p>
<p>He committed war crimes in Syria too, were he admitted on national television "We're keeping the oil." You cannot steal another countries resources especially since we are not officially at war with Syria. We have troops in Syria and despite claiming he was withdrawing troops we still have over 3000 troops there.</p>
<p>The killing of General Salimani, also a war crime. The US actually officially invited Salimani to mediate in a meeting between Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. He had diplomatic immunity while traveling and he was subsequently killed using the "Bethlehem Doctrine" a very sketchy means of reasoning to carry out extra judicial killings on foreign soil and detailed in <a href="https://theduran.com/lies-the-bethlehem-doctrine-and-the-illegal-murder-of-soleimani/">this article.</a></p>
<p><em>"What very few people,</em> <strong><em>and almost no international lawyers</em></strong>, <em>accept is the key to the Bethlehem Doctrine – that here “Imminent” – the word used so carefully by Pompeo – does not need to have its normal meanings of either “soon” or “about to happen”</em>. <strong><em>An attack may be deemed “imminent”, according to the Bethlehem Doctrine, even if you know no details of it or when it might occur.</em></strong> <em>So you may be assassinated by a drone or bomb strike – and the doctrine was specifically developed to justify such strikes – because of “intelligence” you are engaged in a plot, when that intelligence neither says what the plot is nor when it might occur. Or even more tenuous, because there is intelligence you have engaged in a plot before, so it is reasonable to kill you in case you do so again."</em></p>
<p>The first Gulf War was fought over a similar scenario and we invaded Iraq for it in 1991. Difference is it was Kuwait who was stealing the oil and Iraq attacked them, with the US's permission and Iraq was punished for it.</p>
<p>It pains me that Americans don't due there due diligence regarding foreign policy. What's even more perplexing is you'll believe the MSM when they say Trump will protect you from the big bad mooslums but you call BS on the virus. Ever occur to you they might be lying about it all? Were you aware of this flimsy dubious Bethlehem doctrine?</p>
<p>100% of Trump supporters I've mention this to give me the same blank stare I get from a doomer when I point out the virus has not been isolated and that the PCR test isn't designed for diagnosis. This is the reason why people believe in the 'Rona, willful ignorance.</p>

        <p>Most of that stuff was setup by previous administrations because of the military industrial complex/intel services with little to no judicial oversite. Like blaming Trump for "kids in cages" when Obama built the cages. Theres no new wars. All this mess has been happening since the early 2000s and even before. Like you said, Trump is not a savior figure, he cant fix the world in 1 or even 2 terms. </p>
<p>Bodies and drone strikes in the middle east is not enough for me to get angry at Trump and act like I am some bleeding heart centrist. The middle east is fucked and its always been fucked and theres too much money to be made in keeping it fucked. Sorry thats the world and reality. </p>
<p>The military industrial complex and the intelligence agencies are bigger than the presidency and thats just the facts. Trump is virtually surrounded in the white house by swamp creatures so dramatic and lasting change, even positive, is extremely difficult. Sure, we can criticize Trump for all the things he didnt do, and theres a lot. </p>
<p>A puppet, warmonger, and deepstater? Dont think so. All you did was outline foeign policy problems that are not unique to this administration. Problems that a lot of times are outside presidential influence.</p>
