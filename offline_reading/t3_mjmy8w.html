    <strong>Take Your Degree And Shove it Up. It Won't Mean Nothing, In The Near Future.</strong>
    <p><p>Yeah you heard me. We are not going back to normal. This is the great effing Reset. Masks will be made effing mandatory permanently and same with this bs vaccine. Most middle class businesses have already been destroyed while, your getting petting monthly checks to "stay home" which you think the government is doing a favour to you. No you low IQ covid doomer idiots inflation, and cost of living will rise so much that, your petty check won't mean nothing. This is the great reset. Listen the F up. </p>
<p>The people that think all this nonsense that is made mandatory, and keep giving the gov the applause that they are doing something "great" to help us, go F yourselves. They want you to bow down to them, and be their slaves. You guys are getting screwed the ass by all fronts and yet you don't see it.</p>
<p>You guys worship that fauchi F doll and bow down to suck his off. They screwed up the economy so much, that we are not going back to the old normal. We are all screwed.Â  And these Biden worshippers, are blind to even see it. Take that degree and go F yourselves with it. It won't mean shi in the near future. All the guys I've talked to that did MBA, and what not, they legit told Me it's over man. And it truly is. As hard it's to say it.</p></p>
