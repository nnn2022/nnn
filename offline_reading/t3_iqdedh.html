    <strong>Keep the Pen!</strong>
    <p><p>Jesus Christ, just back from the dentist. The receptionist was batshit crazy with the security theatre. I come in, and she pushes a survey toward me on a clipboard, you know the one, and says abruptly, "Fill it out and sign it. And let me take your temperature." I leave the pen on the counter and turn to head to my seat by the door, and I get this, "KEEP THE PEN!" Holy hell. I lifted it and put it on the floor behind my chair. Then I'm waiting and waiting. And she comes out with her spray and starts blathering on about people back in her church that died and she CANNOT BELIEVE THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T TAKE THIS VIRUS SERIOUS!! She was taking the piss out of me. She sprayed and sprayed and rubbed and rubbed and sprayed some more. She did the counter, the clipboard and even the door handle and the handle on the outside. It was clear I had CONTAMINATED her workspace. Once called in for my cleaning, I had to listen to the Dentist and her assistant laugh and carry on and belittle people that don't want to wear the muzzle. I laid there with my mouth open. It made me so sick. She can't wait until the vaccine, she said, so that we don't have to wear the masks. URGH!!! I purposely got up and did not put my muzzle on and spoke to her about teeth grinding. I could tell she was getting a bit uneasy. She hurriedly answered my question, and her body language spoke volumes: get the fuck out of here before you give us all Covid!!</p></p>

        <p>They're actually real. I had one, in February, when I probably had COVID but didn't know it. I only recognized it after, LOL. But the good news is that I'm supposedly immunocompromised but I didn't even end up in the hospital.</p>

        <p>Very VERY few. They wear N95s (and in this setting- they should). I’ve not heard of even ONE outbreak traced to a dental office either. Dentists and their staffs have been doing this for years and years and are pros at infection control.</p>

        <p>I went to pay my phone bill at the mall the other day, and I was waiting for a long time because the customers ahead of me were yammering with the girl working the counter over the masks. Not kidding. Just going on and on about how only "crazies and idiots" refuse to wear the mask, how the masks are cute and bring out people's eyes, how the masks were comfortable and they never wanted to go back to not wearing them and so on. This went on for <strong>ten minutes</strong>, them just gushing like that, until I got fed up, and left. This is why I find it very hard to believe people on here who claim "everyone hates the masks", because I see the exact opposite, just a creepy admiration for them, and a push for masks as a part of the "New Normal".</p>

        <p>I’ve only worn a mask once this whole time. I’ve actually started wearing lip gloss and lip stain more bc I never realized how important our mouths are to all forms of communication. </p>
<p>I’ve actually brought that up to people and they look at me like I’m crazy for a minute but they have to realize it sometime right? Just plant that seed. The masks cut off a large portion of our ability to connect and communicate with other people. </p>
<p>I look at peoples mouths a lot when they talk to gather information. It helps me understand what they are saying and I can usually tell the emotion connected to what they’re talking about.</p>
<p>Luckily I live in an area where the majority doesn’t believe the state can MANDATE you to wear a mask anyway. I would say it’s probably 60/40 with mask wearing on a decline around here. I’ve also never been hassled about not wearing once. Got an evil eye once and a couple “friendly reminders” from staff but I just don’t go places I don’t have a choice to wear one or not.</p>

        <p>Masks are very uncomfortable if worn while doing anything physically strenuous. That's just the reality, regardless of your political views. I have gone to several BLM marches where at the beginning almost everyone is masked, and after several hours of marching many people have let them slip off. Also on hikes typically people will not wear masks during the climbing parts. I remember seeing a video of police in NYC shoving a woman to the floor in front of her kid because her mask slipped off, she was climbing up stairs and I think she was talking about how she couldn't breathe. That is just the reality: the oxygen deprivation caused by masks is slightly enough not to matter while you're standing or sitting around, but it causes real problems if you're doing anything that's tough for you physically.</p>

<p>Normally when I visit the doctor I have to sign the paperwork at the front desk but apparently not anymore! All the medical professionals I see are really nice but it worries me how easy it is for somebody else to sign off on the bill for you, and whether this could be abused.</p>

        <p>Same thing happened to me yesterday.  Was in the dentist office with my son.  We were the only non employees in the office...  my son was in the back with denitist I was in waiting room ( the only one) and the receptionist was behind desk.  I woman in her like 100s came in.  All alone.  Gasped when she saw me sitting with my mask on reading a mag.  The receptionist told her to come in and the woman said “is it safe with her there?” Meaning me.   Now I know I showered in the morning and wasn’t crawling with bed bugs or lice so what did she mean?  The dreaded Covid Cooties??? I couldn’t help myself so proceeded to “fake cough” uncontrollably ( did I mention I live in Diblahhhsio world? ) which explains my dark cynical humor. She crept outside and waited in the lobby. Are these people serious??? That woman prob lived through 7 major wars (including the Civil) the Depression , the Hindenburg and at least some quasi illnesses. I am done with these morons.</p>

        <p>I'm a rebel. I went to three businesses today without a mask on and they didn't care. First place, the cashier was running around with her mask below her nose.</p>

        <p>Ugh I’m so sorry that was your experience. I switched dentists recently and the staff at the new office couldn’t have been nicer. They did the temp checks and screening questions as required, but other than that they had a fun, friendly environment. (The front desk staffer who met me at the door had her dog in the office that day.) I hope you find a dentist with less insane staff. And what’s with these medical professionals who are so weirded out and uptight about COVID? I know a lady who’s a doctor; she and her kids skate with me. She didn’t want her kids changing out of their skates in a room that was “too crowded” with less than 10 people in it. Like WTF, Karen how did you survive medical school? </p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for the tangent. She should have saved the conversation about her church for the break room or her house. It sounds like this office wasn’t particularly professional before the pandemic but now they are justified for acting like this, so they run with it.</p>

        <p>Wow I would switch dentists!! My spouse is a dentist and he and EVERY SINGLE ONE of his staff are anti-lockdown and skeptics in their personal lives. They have to do the the health screenings and masks in the waiting room- because it is required by law and they could be shut down otherwise. They don’t discuss their views with the patients. Dental offices have always been extremely hygienic and pros at infection control. Most of these new requirements are simply security theater required to keep the office open.</p>

        <p>Does he require his patients to gargle some medicated mouthwash for 30 seconds? The assistant set a timer and said it was required now. I  tried my best to keep it in the front of my mouth. God knows wtf is even in that. And yes, I need to find a new dentist.</p>

        <p>Nope- he does not! It is not required and many offices are not doing that. Yes- just find a new dentist. The majority of dentists (and I know a LOT of them) think this is all a bunch of BS for anyone but the extremely elderly and/or frail.</p>

        <p>i don't agree with masks, but i don't think you should try and scare people who do chose to wear masks by going up close to them. just show them that you don't care and leave them alone</p>

How do you know in what proximity I stood? BTW, I never have tried to scare anyone.</p>
