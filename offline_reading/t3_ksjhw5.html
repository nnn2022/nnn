        <p>I have to admit I thought Johnson was an idiot for going for herd immunity... But it would've been the right choice, because summer is outdoor time which would've allowed a more relaxed spread of the virus with a moderate load on health services. </p>

        <p>No-one is following this. Everyone makes their own exceptions (some a lot bigger than others'). We still don't have a curfew, a blanket stay-at-home order, or a ban on religious gatherings, so compared to <em>some</em> - *cough*, Cali - we're doing well.</p>

What you have described is a totalitarian nightmare beyond anything I ever thought imaginable. However just because something isn't THAT, doesnt mean it isnt insane.<br>
How often have you heard people ask "am I allowed to....".People are getting used to the idea of requring permission for every aspect of their lives.  </p>

        <p>That's genuinely frightening, and brings up something I read about early in the days of all these U-turns and half-statements: the intention is to make people unsure of the law, so if things are assumed to be illegal (a complete reversal of the norm) we will remain unsure and cowed. I'm sorry to hear all those people bought into it (especially that deranged co-worker; he does know he's in a building full of other people, right?).</p>
<p>Still, I don't know anyone that committed to the law. Among them, if they don't know whether something is illegal they just go and do it. There's near-zero enforcement and none of them have been caught. Maybe there's a big class divide in how likely people are to obey the restrictions? To middle-class families for whom getting a fine or a record is a big deal, it's a much greater threat than to those whose friendship group includes ABH Alan and Disorderly Dave.</p>

        <p>I think its subtle and insidous in it's effect. Of course people break these "laws", however in the act of doing something such a normal thing as visiting a family member, people have an awareness that they shouldnt be do it. And the millitant sect which have emerged is growing and becomeing more severe in their investment.<br>
Even the thought process of "fuck it, i'll walk the dog whenever I want" has such dark underdones in the very fact of it's exitence.</p>
<p>That in engaging in even the most funadmental and unassuming acts of day to day life, people now instictively check internally whether they have permission. Whether they decide to or not inspite of this is irrelevant, the thought pattern has been embedded.<br>
For what it's worth, I don't believe in some grand conspiracy. Rather it's like watching a society which for a generation have been distracted to such a degree where they have been completely able to avoid confronting the realities of their own inevitable mortality and even more so, the lack of inerant meaning in life and death.   </p>
<p>Suddenly it has became unavoidable, and as a defence mechanism they try to retreat into the safety of non-existence in the hopes they can go back to blissful ignorance.  </p>
<p>Bit of a tangent there.....sorry.  </p>
<p>I guess the TLDR of what im trying to say is:  If every action you perform outside of your home is autimatically checked against the edicts of the government, we are in a worse state as a collective than humanity has ever been. Even in the worst kind of totalitarian states, there was distinct allowed or not allowed and people were free to do the things they were allowed to do.  </p>
<p>Now all we are free to do is work. Everything else must be approved.</p>

<p>Reminds me of this post I saw a few months back, where somebody asks for advice on how to disinfect their notebooks because they don't want them to be "vectors for disease transmission". </p>

<p>It is absolutely bizarre the way people are acting...no, your stationary is not going to kill anyone, you all need to chill out. The problem is, when people are allowed to get away with this behaviour, they feel justified in doing it again...that's how the craziness spreads.</p>

        <p>LMAO. As someone who escaped schizophrenic psychosis in late 2019 - it was so funny seeing everyone else go insane! But sad, and it's no surprise it has lead to many suicides, just like psychosis left unchecked. Paranoia, insanity, and fear are good things, so long as the nice man on TV says so!</p>

        <p>&rt; The fact that my mum asked me "am I allowed to see Uncle peter because he lives on his own"</p>
<p>Serious question for your ma:  What's the alternative?  Leave Uncle Peter to die on his own? (I may be wrong, but I'm assuming Uncle Peter is older and warrants a visit once in a while, if for no other reason, just to say 'hi' and to make sure he's OK.)  Regardless of what any government agency says, people who are getting on in years appreciate and sometimes depend on visits from relatives.  Would she stop doing that just because some prick says not to?</p>
