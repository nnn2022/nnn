    <strong>The lack of questioning / analysis in most people is what frightens me the most.</strong>
    <p><p>If you were to ask someone why they're taking the vaccine, why they pee themselves in fear when someone enters a store with no mask, why they wear a mask IN THE CAR, why the haven't seen their family in months, ect, ect - They would tell you the usual response.  </p>
<p>There is a deadly pandemic, no a - GLOBAL PANDEMIC happening and they are trying to stay safe.  </p>
<p>Fair enough, right? But is there ever an ounce of fact checking before you go ahead and cower to fear? Any conversations with friends and family about the validity of this GlObAl PaNdEmIc besides "I can't wait to go out again" and "It's so terrible, I know!".  </p>
<p>There isn't. Surely there must be a common resource the brain utilizes to think through a situation before committing. To run through a check list of things that do / do not pass before you mindlessly obey. But no - It's entirely devoid of that resource. It simply doesn't exist.  </p>
<p>Again, when this topic is brought up it's so terrifying because it is as though they have NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT QUESTIONING it. The fear that appears on their face when they realize that maybe this isn't the whole story. So you're shut down, call a conspiracy theorist and that's that.</p></p>

        <p>I was a Covid true believer but my past in conspiracy trained me to examine things, and even early on, I questioned PCR tests and why they let Covid spread. Let's just say the mountain of BS they were shoveling just stopped holding up. They are basically using trauma programming on the populace, fear shuts down critical thinking. Everyone is afraid of death or loved one's dying and they are using that to the max. This is why they are getting people to line up for an experimental vaccine.</p>

        <p>You can be very emotional and think for yourself at the same time. The difficulty is separating emotions from decision making which is very difficult to do for a lot of people.</p>

        <p>In my experience, 65% of people are leaning towards emotional thinking, also called emotional thinkers. These people have a tendency to follow. They go towards what their feelings and impulses direct them to do. This makes them great paired up with other emotional thinkers, but also most confined to their instincts, tending to be oblivious. 25% of people lean towards logical thinking. These people lean more towards leading than following. They question things, but tend to be less emotionally active than their emotional counterparts. 10% doesn't fit in both, and can be considered "abstract thinkers", following an abnormal thinking pattern. Artists tend to be like this, but someone with aspergers syndrome or autism could also be considered an abstract thinker. </p>
<p>This is not real science of course, just something i've observed.</p>

        <p>I am on the autistic spectrum. Most Aspies I know are questioning this narrative, however some of the STEM focused ones, are falling down, the "it's science" pit.</p>

        <p>It worries me when people who follow their intuition don’t have any major red flags about the psychopaths running this narrative. I’m a very emotional/intuitive person and after the initial scare, the insincerity and manipulation became so obvious. But I guess a lot of people aren’t taking a moment to discern between intuition and anxiety.</p>

        <p>This is all so true. I'm a dreaded anti-masker and when I see people flee from me in a grocery store I just shake my head. I'm a very fit, healthy person. If the argument is "you may have it but not know it" then are we really so scared of a virus so weak that we don't even know we have it? All of us in the store could be "spreading" it but absolutely none of us have the slightest symptom? Wow. This really has been the most incredible marketing campaign in human history.</p>

        <p>More people are followers then leaders. People as animals weren’t made to question. The brain doesn’t want to learn; it wants things to confirm what it knows. This roots in the whole pack thing and yadda yadda. But the media is exploiting these things most cannot control, and they give in, because following is easier then thinking.</p>
