    <strong>"They live different lives outside of the cities."</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/11/how-life-could-change-2030/</p>
<p>So in this BS article we have all read by now (if you haven't please read) this simple statement is what gives me hope. "They live different kinds of lives outside of the city" </p>
<p>This means that people like us, people who won't give into the false worldview of the perpetrators of "the great reset." Will be "allowed" to live in our own cities off the grid and completely autonomous of the regime? Am I reading this right? I mean we might be subjugated to share croppers at best and vilified as outsiders at worst. Never to be allowed into these "reset Cities." You know what? Fuck them. We can do it ourselves. Independent of a mother or father figure via authorarian regimes.</p>
<p>My proposal is that we start now. We get out of the cities, move into small farming villages, put our energy strictly into positive things. We won't have advertisers, we'll have builders. We won't have 5000 different deodorants. Just one that works very well. Same with any product. Get rid of the useless jobs meant to just keep societal collapse at bay. We won't have investment brokers but will have bakers and farmers. Mechanics and electricians. People that matter with the same, sane goal in mind. Complete unity of the human race. Let the love flow. </p>
<p>I'm not saying this to sound like a communist or that we should live in a commune but we should all have jobs that's actually matter, not stealing R &amp; D from another company to copy the same products over and over again. </p>
<p>We should only put our energy towards what actually matters in this world. Living and loving a positive life as a human being on this planet while still owning our bodies minds and spirits. I believe we can do it. </p>
<p>Different forms of media have called it "Paradise" or "Outer Heaven" or "Galts Gulch." These are all the same idea. Create a breakaway society free from the cluches of lies we've been told since birth. We can focus on objectivity instead of subjectivity. Parent our children with the simple phrase "always tell the truth." And hold an objective view of nature in the highest regard. Get back to what matters. Get back to nature.</p>
<p>We should be using technology in a more positive way. A way in which we control it and not the other way around.</p>
<p>We should own our minds, bodies and souls. Not others.</p>
<p>We should own our rightfully obtained property through and through to do as we see fit with it. As long as it hurts nobody else or nature.</p>
<p>We should only use what's needed and keep things to a minimum by proper use and preparation of goods and services. </p>
<p>We should protect ourselves in a moral way and live morrally.</p>
<p>Fuck these cities and fuck these authoritarian motherFUCKERS. Be free.</p></p>

        <p>Idk if you read the Hunger Games, but in the very first few chapters, Katniss mentions a girl she saw running through the woods (that she wasn’t supposed to be in) and she says it in a way that implies there are a few people who elected to live outside of the districts. She sees this girl running for her life from a Capitol helicopter and then doesn’t see her again. Until she arrives at the Capitol and the girl is a servant with her tongue cut out. </p>
<p>I don’t want to live in those cities but it is dangerous that they will even exist. It allows for all kinds of things to go on on the outside and they still control it. Except if they do bad things, no one inside the cities knows about it. It creates outlaws and abandoned people. They could do anything to us, and no one would help us. We would have minimal resources and they would have everything. We would always be the test subjects, the pets, the servants, the victims, the people they turn to when they need a punching bag. </p>
<p>Do not allow these control cities to exist.</p>

        <p>You're right but I do not live in a city, I can't do anything about it and I don't care for the city life as it feels like being mentally strangled. </p>
<p>I urge anyone with any ounce of confidence in self sustainability to get the fuck out while they can. I wish we could save them but most metropolitan areas have fallen.</p>

        <p>I agree. If the cities are inevitable, we need to at least make sure we have the upper hand out there. Let it be known not to mess with us.</p>

<p>The people who refuse to be part of the IOB and smart cities will live in " equivalent of 18th century slums " outside the cities </p>
<p>Slums they will be realising disease from </p>

        <p>You can move out the city however.. you still need your name tied to them to use their currency</p>
<p>Money and internet are two problems moving off grid.</p>
