    <strong>COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death: disentangling facts and values</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;<strong>even in the case of mere suspicion of COVID-19, that is to say in the absence of swab or serological testing or other diagnostic imaging procedure that reliably confirms the infection, the disease must in any case be indicated as the underlying cause of death.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Therefore epidemiological and public health reasons make it possible to indicate COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death <strong>even in the case of a mere unconfirmed suspicion</strong>, and thus to identify COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death even in the presence of other and independent lethal causal chains.</p>
<p>&rt;As in the case of COVID-19, this was supposed to reflect interests of importance for public health, <strong>rather than what is acceptable from a purely medical point of view.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>a statement on a death certificate, identifying COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death,</strong> may be considered a non-purely descriptive predicate, as grounded on both factual (causal chains and the patient’s medical conditions before and at the time of death) and <strong>non-factual reasons</strong> (the importance of prevention and the epidemiological clause exception).</p>

        <p>Am I reading that correctly that covid can/should be listed a the cause of death for <strong>non-factual</strong> reasons from a public health/prevention view point?</p>
<p>For example, we want less <strong>actual</strong> road deaths so we will list everything as a road death to slow down everyone's driving?</p>
<p>Surely im reading this wrong?</p>

        <p><em>To compound on what OP said:</em></p>
<p><strong>Mortality Coding</strong> (related to OP's post):</p>
<p>https://www.propublica.org/article/study-urges-cdc-to-revise-count-of-deaths-from-medical-error</p>
<p>&rt;Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch for the CDC, disputed that the agency’s coding is the problem. He said complications from medical care are listed on death certificates, and that codes do capture them. The CDC’s published mortality statistics, however, count only the “underlying cause of death,” defined as the condition that led a person to seek treatment.
<strong>As a result, even if a doctor does list medical errors on a death certificate, they are not included in the published totals. Only the underlying condition, such as heart disease or cancer, is counted, even when it isn’t fatal.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>i think the problem lies in people's unwarranted faith in the healthcare system, when it was designed since the prohibition of hemp/marijuana to become a "for profit" industry that creates patients rather than cures them. this makes it much harder for people to realize they are being lied to</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>so basically you can be diagnosed at anytime without a test, which is the opposite of how medical errors are coded:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Covid Coding</strong> (Case Guidelines)</p>
<p>https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/covid19/en/</p>
<p>&rt;An emergency ICD-10 code of ‘U07.2 COVID-19, virus not identified’ is assigned to a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 <strong>where laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Both U07.1 and U07.2 <strong>may be used for mortality coding as cause of death.</strong></p>
<p><strong>contact tracing invents cases as well</strong> (Scrubbed website below)</p>
<p><strong>Covid Guidelines to determine cases:</strong></p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html</p>
<p><em>so a test is not required for a positive case or a Covid death statistic</em></p>
<p><strong>Covid Case Guidelines</strong>
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/case-definition/2020/</p>
<p><em>this site included a heading at the top in bold, not just "Interim-ID-01/02" BEFORE APRIL 2020</em></p>
<ul>
<li>CSTE statement <em>was</em> Interim-20-ID-01:</li>
</ul>
<p>https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19_NO.pdf</p>
<ul>
<li>Which states: "CSTE will assume all targets during contact tracing are asymptomatic and thus be counted as a positive case"</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(Since, they have switched to Interim-20-ID-<strong>02</strong>:</em>)</p>
<p>https://www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/ps/positionstatement2020/Interim-20-ID-02_COVID-19.pdf</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>which states the same thing</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>aka if you display any common symptoms for any common illness (like a cough) or maybe went to a place where someone might have coughed, you could be determined positive through contact tracing. Contact tracing assumes all people are positive, due to potential asymptomatic cases which is why the case count is inflated</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death year after year according to an 8 year Johns Hopkins study (doctors are people too and make mistakes):</p>
<p>https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/study_suggests_medical_errors_now_third_leading_cause_of_death_in_the_us</p>
<p>https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/05/03/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death/</p>
<ul>
<li>covid case and death counts are inflated medical errors and assumptions! (as well as contact tracing which literally invents cases, as well as hospital's monetary incentives)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Doctors take bribes and kickbacks to prescibe medications, even if it's known to be deadly like Fentanyl, so why would Covid be any different:</strong></p>
<p>https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/practices/another-doctor-charged-taking-bribes-kickbacks-to-prescribe-fentanyl-alleged-insys-scheme</p>
<p>https://www.propublica.org/article/doctors-prescribe-more-of-a-drug-if-they-receive-money-from-a-pharma-company-tied-to-it</p>
<p><strong>convid</strong> https://www.denverpost.com/2020/05/20/coronavirus-covid-medicare-payments-hospitals/</p>
<p>&rt;“The idea that hospitals and doctors are falsely inflating COVID numbers and even putting patients on ventilators to drive up their payments is not just ridiculous, but it’s insulting to the doctors who are putting their own lives at risk,” said Joe Hanel, spokesperson for the Colorado Health Institute.</p>
<p><strong>interesting, because nationally, the next link shows how MAYBE 21% would be under the age of 65 and not on Medicare, everyone else was a senior citizen:</strong> <em>(38,000 out of 180,000)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>94% of Covid deaths involves 2.6 comorbities, is this akin to medical errors and they just report the statistics however they want?</em>
https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TLDR: there is quite literally zero burden of proof to determine a Covid case or death, it relies on assumptions in case guidelines, contact tracing, and morbidity statistics; this is not a conspiracy</strong></p>
