    <strong>CDC Director - Case of Nepotism? Or More?</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone looked into Rochelle Walensky? The current Director of the CDC.  Some quick googling and I thought this was all pretty interesting. Apologize if this is nothing new. BUT, this is what I found after 30 minutes of googling. Just facts below, you can make up your own mind if there is something nefarious here. But I find it hard to believe this is just a coincidence--that the CDC Director (an appointed position) has a father this well connected.</p>
<h1>Rochelle Walensky:</h1>
<p>-She is the current (new) Director of the CDC.</p>
<p>-She was appointed by the Biden/Harris administration. She is an obvious supporter of this administration, even referencing the Biden/Harris administration's plan with vaccines as "our plan" and has shown support in various other ways.</p>
<p>- All she does as CDC Director is push the Covid Vaccine. Check her twitter.</p>
<p>- She recently tweeted that giving 1 million vaccines to 12-17 year old kids would prevent just ONE death, yet would also cause 40 cases of myocarditis (heart disease). <a href="https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1408116464683569157">https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1408116464683569157</a></p>
<p>- Her father is Edward Bersoff</p>
<p>This is where things get interesting. <br>
At the very least, this is an obvious case of nepotism. Potentially a case of corruption and deeper implications. There is no way it is just a coincidence that the CDC Director (an appointed position) has a father this well connected! And, on top of that, this so-called CDC Director is anything but scientific in her actions, and clearly is just a political mouthpiece/puppet.</p>
<h1>Edward H. Bersoff:</h1>
<p>Read about his extensive connections, work history, and board seats here:<a href="http://www.knowledgeway.org/about/board/bersoff.html">http://www.knowledgeway.org/about/board/bersoff.html</a><a href="https://www.cmequity.com/dredwardhbersoff">https://www.cmequity.com/dredwardhbersoff</a></p>
<p>- Edward Bersoff founded BTG, Inc. BTG Inc. was essentially an information technology company for the government. 60% of their business was government contracts. And mainly military and DoD contracts in nature. Read about it here: <a href="https://www.company-histories.com/BTG-Inc-Company-History.html">https://www.company-histories.com/BTG-Inc-Company-History.html</a>  </p>
<p>- Edward Bersoff sold his company to Titan Corporation. He was then appointed to the board of Titan Corporation.</p>
<p>-Titan's business is almost strictly military and US Department of Homeland Security contracts. And they have had several PROVEN controversies/illegal operations, from money laundering to global political bribes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Corporation">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Corporation</a>Two examples below:</p>
<ul>
<li>On March 2, 2005, the company admitted to illegally providing $2 million to the 2001 re-election campaign of President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_K%C3%A9r%C3%A9kou">Mathieu Kérékou</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin">Benin</a>, and agreed to pay $28.5 million in fines and civil penalties.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Corporation#cite_note-4">[4]</a> Titan pleaded guilty and paid the largest penalty under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in history for bribery and filing false tax returns.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Corporation#cite_note-5">[5]</a></li>
<li>Titan Corp briefly partnered with SkyWay Communications<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Corporation#cite_note-6">[6]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Corporation#cite_note-MadCow-7">[7]</a> and owned stock in several other corporations related to SkyWay. SkyWay's former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC9">DC9</a> aircraft, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N900SA">N900SA</a>, was captured in April 2006 with 5.5 tons of cocaine on board. Investigation of the cocaine bust by Mad Cow Morning News<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Corporation#cite_note-MadCow-7">[7]</a> led to the discovery that Titan had employed Makram Chams, a Lebanese national. Chams owned a Kwik-Check convenience store in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice,_Florida">Venice, Florida</a>, where the biggest overseas money transfer to the 9/11 terrorists ($70,000 from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE">UAE</a>) was sent, according to the testimony of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI">FBI</a> agents during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_Commission">9/11 Commission</a> hearings.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Titan Corporation was awarded "a competitive contract with a potential value of $163.9 million from the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command on behalf of the U.S. Northern Command for the US Joint Task Force Civil Support on January 12, 2005. The contract is "to provide a full range of planning, analysis, exercise, and information technology services for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Consequence Management operations," a Titan press release announced."-This company essentially is the sole operator of the US biological management operations and information technology.</p>
<p>Here is a excerpt from news of a Government Contract BTG was awarded. What's interesting here is BTG's "team members". Specifically, Telos Federal Systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>June 7, 1996</em> - The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has selected Virginia-based <a href="http://www.btg.com/">BTG, Inc.</a> as one of the prime contractors on the $1.1 billion Information Technology Omnibus Procurement (ITOP) program. The ITOP contract, designed for the purchase of information technology services and products by DOT, is also open to other federal agencies. BTG's team members are <a href="http://www.colybrand.com/">Coopers &amp; Lybrand</a>, Telos Federal Systems, Computer Based Systems,<a href="http://www.hdm.com/">Harvard Design &amp; Mapping</a>, <a href="http://www.ncsi.com/">Novadyne Computer Systems, Inc.</a>, Reliable Integration Services, Technautics, D.H. Wagner and Associates and <a href="http://www.access.digex.net/~wizdom/">Wizdom Federal</a>.</li>
<li>Telos Federal Systems essentially runs the DoD's and other government agency's cloud network and cyber security.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos_(company)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos_(company)</a><a href="https://www.telos.com/solutions/federal-government/">https://www.telos.com/solutions/federal-government/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can continue to go down the rabbit hole of Titan, BTG, Inc. Edward Bersoff.  The more you google, the more you find. It's endless. Edward Bersoff is also associated with the Electronics Research Center of NASA. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_Research_Center">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_Research_Center</a>  </p>
<p>-Currently, he is mainly involved on various committees and boards, mostly financial in nature. He is the money man when it comes to government contracts. </p>
<p>- He is on the board of a Private Equity firm that appears to specialize in political/government dealings.<a href="https://www.cmequity.com/dredwardhbersoff">https://www.cmequity.com/dredwardhbersoff</a><a href="https://www.cmequity.com/past-investments">https://www.cmequity.com/past-investments</a></p>
<p>- Ed Bersoff was recently appointed to the board of Solerity, a US national security tech company. And 5 months later, the company underwent a full re-branding, focusing entirely on government contracts.<br>
This guy is everywhere. And it's just a coincidence that his daughter was appointed to the Director of the CDC? </p>
<p>- Ed Bersoff has played a role in the US's reaction to Covid. And he is personally writing to POTUS and Congress trying to influence them!<br>

<p>-  Ed Bersoff recently founded Parabilis, a government contracting company. He and his company pushed for PPP loans to use Parabilis, so that they could profit.  <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2020/07/ppp-money-is-back-for-now/">https://federalnewsnetwork.com/commentary/2020/07/ppp-money-is-back-for-now/</a> </p>
<p>- In the interview linked below, he openly talks about the "mysterious world of government contracting".<a href="https://www.myja.org/news/latest/2020/8/24/learn-about-the-2020-laureates-ed-bersoff">https://www.myja.org/news/latest/2020/8/24/learn-about-the-2020-laureates-ed-bersoff</a><br>
<a href="https://parabilis.com/">https://parabilis.com/</a></p>
<p>-I'm still looking into it, but I would venture to guess that Parabilis, as well as the Private Equity firm he is on the board of (CM Equity) is benefiting directly or indirectly from the government contracts due to Covid and Covid Relief bills. The government is handing out billions of dollars because of covid. This guy is the king of government contracts. He is still starting companies and serving on boards. And his daughter is the Director of the CDC! The sole US entity/agency responsible for how the country reacts to Covid. If covid goes away, so does the trillions of dollars the US is printing and handing out (because of Covid).</p>
<p>This is so blatant and transparent. It's not even hidden.<br>
Regardless if you don't think there is anything remotely nefarious here, at the very least, it is extremely unlikely that this man's extensive and deep political and government connections did not have any impact or involvement in his child's current position that is CDC Director. Which, I will remind you for a third time, is an appointed position.</p>
<h1>TLDR: Current CDC Director was appointed by Biden/Harris administration also happens to have a very successful father with extensive ties to government.</h1>
<p>My final thoughts on why this is important and should be looked into further. The CDC Director should not be a political position. It should be as simple as that. This posts is simply trying to show that it is most likely riddled with politics and favors and nepotism. It is the Director of the Center of Disease Control and Prevention. No where in that job title or entire agency should we want politics playing a role in the decisions. The most qualified person should have the position, not the person with the most political connections. Countless lives are at stake.<br>
Furthermore, it IS an important position and has DRASTIC consequences and implications. Beyond just human lives. The Director of the CDC is responsible for how the US is reacting to the COVID pandemic, from a health perspective and a political/government perspective. Hundreds of thousands of people have died, generations are being jabbed with vaccines, social distancing restrictions, covid restrictions, mask mandates, government over-reach, complete disregard for the Constitution, stimulus, jobs, inflation, etc...the entire way our society, government, and culture function is being effected by Covid and how the CDC chooses to react to it. And these are not short term change. We will feel these consequences for the rest of American history. One third of all US dollars were printed in the last year solely because of Covid! Our monetary system is totally screwed because of Covid (yes, it already was a lost cause, I know).<br>
<strong>I would argue that nothing has been more important or influential to the US than the Covid Pandemic. And the CDC is at the center of it.</strong><br>
YET, the Director of this organization might be a simple case of political favors, connections, or nepotism. And the Director's father could be profiting from this or influencing the decisions of the organizations? And no one is talking about this or questioning this position at all?<br>
Yes, Rochelle has an exhaustive resume. But once you start to look into that, you can also see/argue that her resume may also be a case of nepotism or connections. For example, her father has extensive ties to Harvard...where Rochelle was a professor and conducted research. I haven't yet, but I'd be curious to see Bersoff's donation history.</p></p>
