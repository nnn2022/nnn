    <strong>Covid Vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>I know mostly everyone here is aware of that community. But has anyone noticed how mentally ill they are over there? Almost every single thread there are people bringing up symptoms they had etc. and "oh that was my anxiety" or I had symptoms that "I chalked up to my anxiety like nausea, fatigue, etc." There is always references to anxiety or depression in a lot of these threads and other mental illnesses. Anyway I am just wondering if anyone else notices it and thinks that it contributes to their doomerism or lack of values toward freedom. Also there is usually something like this that I saw in a recent post about some young guy who had covid but got the vaccine anyway and had a rough go of it and sore swollen lymph nodes and lockjaw. " Just keep reminding yourself that a rough ride means your immune system came out guns blazing and took care of business. You‚Äôre well protected! Yay üòÄ "</p>
<p>It amazes me that they reference the immune system as if it only works alongside a vaccine and not from the natural virus? Insane. Anyway I love you guys. And so thankful this sub is still here after all this time.</p></p>

        <p>It‚Äôs sooo funny. I‚Äôve seen posts where people say they‚Äôve had seizures after their vaccine... and yet people still comment that it‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter than long haul covid.‚Äù I‚Äôve had covid. My parents have had covid. My friends have had covid. it is NOTHING compared to these side effects.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôd bet a vast majority of these mentally ill vax shills are on anti-depressants/anti anxiety medication as well..... </p>
<p>interestingly enough these medications can cause psychosis, mania, can induce bi-polar episodes, and over time, are linked to brain damage.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs interesting to me how doctors prescribe these medications to anyone and everyone. It‚Äôs almost like they want the population numb and helpless. </p>
<p>But trust the science.</p>

        <p>They‚Äôre fucking idiots. Those ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù are actually their body‚Äôs reaction to being poisoned. The human body creates symptoms to try and detoxify itself. What do they think the purpose of having a fever is? It‚Äôs to sweat out poison. Vomiting, a runny nose, a cough, and diarrhea are all created by the body to try and detoxify itself by any means necessary. Symptoms are the cure from being poisoned. Period.</p>

        <p>Yah it blows my mind, these people have zero free thinking capabilities. Your lymph nodes collect and get rid of toxic garbage in your body, and now they are inflamed after the vaccine. But they can't put 2 and two together and think it's the vaccine "working". Yah it's working alright. I read the r/covidvaccinated forum everyday and just roll my eyes, of course I can't comment and give my 2 cents because I was banned months ago lol</p>

        <p>Same. I merely asked a question in one thread and got banned. lol That only reaffirms that we are on the right side of this debate. They have to censor dissent to keep their fake nightmare alive.</p>

        <p>I agree. Regardless of covid, the wayward and violent attitudes of the "woke" crowd is transparently indicative of a lack of faith, and I say that as somebody who is not religious. All the woke crazies I know have no plans for their future, very little desire for their family or to have their own, no real interests, hobbies or tenacious drive, no ambitions...</p>
<p>Lack of spirit, lack of faith, whatever you want to call it, has made these people grip a hold onto anything, ANYTHING to make themselves both the victim and a messiah of virtue at once.</p>
