    <strong>What states/counties are not enforcing shutdowns and masks?</strong>
    <p><p>I am wanting to move somewhere. I have heard Florida has been pretty relaxed about all this. Anyone know other areas not submitting to the NWO?</p></p>

        <p>I'm in Indiana and it's pretty lax. People wear masks but I've never been hassled for not wearing one. Other towns like fort wayne don't care about masks very much. </p>
<p>I went to Montana this summer as well. They are very non compliant on any of the COVID rules. Just don't go to lefty bozeman or missoula.</p>
<p>My dad is in Florida, he says it's pretty much all over, still some mask wearing in stores but everything else is open.</p>

        <p>The real key is to get away from big cities. The closer you are to them the worse things will be. I went out to rural ohio two months ago and nobody was wearing masks. They looked at you weird if you did.</p>

        <p>This is exactly it.  Places that are used to controlling, over reaching government and masses of people who act out of complete avoidance of one another.  Easy to make them comply.  In rural places, where distances between people already are greater, people don’t need to hide in the crowd, and cannot, as there is no crowd to hide in.  In my own metro, I live in what would be considered a suburb.  The closer I venture toward the city core, the more “compliant” some people are, yet, the higher the risk of being a victim of violent crime, because that “sect” of society, doesn’t abide by the rules ANY TIME.  Not just during a pendemic.  The further I drift away from the city center, the less “compliant” with pandemic rules people become, and less likelihood exists of engaging that part of society who thinks they can act in whatever aggressive manner they wish.</p>
<p>The answer is clear: cities are for the criminal element and compliant cucks.  Rural America is for respect for another and common sense.</p>

        <p>Central and rural PA.  Even though our extremely liberal governor is very cautious in his rules, in the red parts (rural/farm) of PA, people are very lax about masks and such.  Where I live (about 10 minutes outside of Hershey, PA) folks wear masks in the big stores like walmart and grocery chains, but you can walk into any smaller local store without a mask and not get a second glance.  Where I get my haircut, the customers - <em>nor the barber ladies</em> - have never worn masks throughout this stupidity (although the shop was closed for about a month and a half).</p>
<p>The funny thing about this particular barbershop is that this is where all the local state cops get their hair cut (we have a big state P.D. barracks and training center nearby.)</p>
<p>Virtually no one wears masks outside, to the point that when I travel somewhere I am always surprised to see people outdoors wearing masks - it looks so strange.</p>

        <p>Down south in certain places. </p>
<p>In my area the only places that typically enforce it are the clinics since they're bought out, but most shops don't seem to enforce it. I don't know how long all of this will last though.</p>

        <p>Like everyone else in here, its the small cities where you can "get away with it". I live in a rural part of va, only about 45 min from DC and its pretty common to not see people wearing one. No reason to resort to moving to FL.</p>

<p>It's been pretty much the same in Europe. Smaller countries somehow managed to "get away from covid" by being too small to be noticed as heaven of no madness... until they get noticed at which point the virus magically invades and cases "skyrocket".</p>

        <p>I would definitely like to move but I'm not convinced that any place that's open now (eg Florida) is guaranteed to be open at any time in the future - not even the near future.</p>
<p>It's not like a governor is a sovereign - these people are all easily politically manipulated, either out in the open (with 'science!' and coordinated media attacks) or behind the scenes with blackmail.</p>
<p>There's nothing stopping them from drumming up rising 'cases' and classifying natural deaths however they like, in an attempt to provoke a demand for more lockdowns, anywhere on Earth. People like us are in an absolute minority and we haven't figured out how to stop stampedes.</p>

        <p>I feel the same way. My idea is that people who are anti-mask need to start congregating to certain areas. Lets take over all the warm states lol. the dumb fucks can live in Alaska and shit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If there was a consensus on where anti-mask people would like to live and it's warm - I'd move there in a fucking heartbeat. We all move to one state/county and take over.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But realistically I think there's enough against it that we could take over the entire south. Bring back the mason dixon line.. this time its an anti-slavery line. people in the north can choose to stay and live as slaves, the rest of us who want freedom can migrate south towards freedom.</p>
