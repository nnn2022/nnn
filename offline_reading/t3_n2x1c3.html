    <strong>You Sure You Love the Military? A Parent's Perspective</strong>
    <p><p>My daughter is 21 and in the reserves, I won't say which branch. She has drill this weekend and has been there for 24 hours. She likes drill and likes her unit....until today.</p>
<p>Now, she has been brow beaten to no end by her mother and I that she is to NEVER allow the military to stick her with this. We have made her promise multiple times that, no matter how great the pressure, she is to resist to the point of being kicked out. She knows very clearly that we are NOT joking about any of this and she trusts us completely.</p>
<p>As soon as she arrived at drill yesterday, the pressure was on. They only meet once per month and most drills have been done remotely  for the past year, which is beyond pathetic. They made sure to gather them in person this time however because the push to get stuck is on! She was not able to go into all the details today, but there are both ridiculous incentives and veiled threats being thrown at those who refuse to be stuck. There is a group of them that have banded together, against their fellow soldiers, to find solidarity and courage to resist. She is quite shocked by the desperate behavior of her superiors and their bizarre pressure has only strengthened her resolve because it is all too strange to not be apprehensive.</p>
<p>We should all be concerned for the morale of our military right now, especially the amongst the lower ranks. The leaders of the military have totally sold us out. We could literally be poisoning our soldiers to death with every shot for all they know. I have told my wife what a devious plan it would be for our military to be completely undone by the "killshot". A brilliant plan of treachery and deceit by our enemies. I believe we are in fantastic danger of that happening.</p>
<p>As a parent and a veteran, I'm outraged by daughter's chain of command but she is a big girl now and it's good that she has to stand up for herself. I could care less if they kicked her out tomorrow as I was never happy she joined to begin with. As a citizen, I have little faith that our military has our best interests at heart and that it will be up to the "formed militias" to defend this great land should we be attacked.</p></p>

        <p>The gulf war syndrome, where soldiers were used as guinea pigs for the profit of big corporate mafia, all enabled by corrupt politicians and uniformed high ups, which then used every dirty tricks possible to deny everything so they wouldn't have to compensate the victims.</p>
<p>Let's also remind ourselves about the Viet-Nam vets who were also denied any support and decency after being exposed to toxic dioxine, thanks to Monsanto and their agent orange defoliant.</p>

        <p>The fact that soldiers can get roped into blindly taking vaccines that are unproven doesn't give me much hope when I see the 2A guys crowing about how the military would side with the people on issues of gun confiscations or rounding up dissidents. The military as a whole will do what it has always done, which is follow orders from people who crowned themselves king.</p>

        <p>We have a base surgeon that made it pretty clear that he could issue medical limitations on a member that would essentially have an individual treated as a walking disease. Officers in charge seem to have no issue with this clearly unethical abuse of authority. It is a constant fear to be in the military right now, not knowing when they will make this mandatory to continue service.</p>

        <p>My fiancée is in the National Guard and I told him the same thing. Luckily the pressure hasn’t been bad for him yet, but we are in Texas so that may be why. I have made it very clear to him under no circumstances will either of us risk this, especially since we want to get pregnant soon AND he has a peanut allergy and has gone into anaphylactic shock before. He didn’t need me to tell him though lol, he had already told them no to doing going to Europe because it would require the vaccine. Good for your daughter for protecting herself.</p>

        <p>Calling the military’s commitment into question just because your daughter’s reservist unit is being a bit weird is a bit over the top. They’ve been told to apply pressure and see what shakes loose. They would still defend you if we were attacked.

        <p>The military was given the report of election fraud before the inauguration. They were obligated, by law, to take specific actions if the election was interfered with by foreign countries. They failed to perform that duty, even in the face of extraordinary evidence that manipulation of the elections had taken place with foreign actors involved. If the military leaders won't do their jobs when clearly directed to do so, what makes you think they will defend us when the enemy comes calling? We have been sold out at every level.</p>

        <p>So you would have preferred the military perform a coup for what to 50% of the United States was a duly elected president, instead of allowing the electoral college to vote as is their job and the general election realistically doesn’t actually have any power over? You want that standard set? Glad you’re not in charge dude.</p>

        <p>I'm for election integrity, I really don't care who wins. It's two sides of the same coin. But someday, like next election, we might need to be sure that all legal votes have been counted and all illegal votes have been dismissed. </p>
<p>As a bonus, it would have been nice to see the military due their duty. Had they done their duty, their would have military supervised elections, so nobody would have ultimately been disenfranchised. Of course, had that happened there would be a LOT less leftists in office today. Their Daddy, Stalin, taught them how to steal votes a long time ago.</p>

        <p>I get the objection but " We could literally be poisoning our soldiers to death with every shot".. that is just false.  Haven't 10s of millions of people gotten the vaccine?  Do you think that there is some time delayed effect and in a few months millions of people will be dropping dead?</p>
<p>I kinda feel sorry for your daughter to be honest. If she is 21 and in the military and still being treated like a 10 year old by her parents.  Overbearing doesn't even begin to describe this situation.</p>
