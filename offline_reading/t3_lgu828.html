    <strong>The cult of covid</strong>
    <p><p>Covid and the Cult.
There's patterns that align between a cult and covid.
1.  The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and regards to their belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as LAW.
(Live by the word of MSM, Fauci, Birx, WHO, CDC, Cooper, and let's not forget that mandates...again are not LAWS)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.
(Censorship, Cancel Culture, job loss)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mind-altering practices such as meditation, chanting, denunciation sessions, or debilitating work routines, are used in excess and serve to suppress doubts about the group and its leaders
(3 W's, posters everywhere, masks, social distancing, reduced capacity of shoppers in a store, small businesses shut down, CNN 24/7 Covid case/death clock, "We are in this together"  "Stay home, Stay safe"  "I wear my mask not for my protection but for my communities protection"  mandating masks at work and in public places.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leaders and its members.
(Mask virtue signaling, Vaccine cards, selfies wearing your mask, all in solidarity.  If you do this then you are a caring human.  If not you are SELFISH!!!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The group has a polarized, us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.
(No matter how something does not make sense, people do not question it, they just do it!  The mask has become a symbol of honor and respect.  As Fauci put it, "It's patriotic"...all while charts, graphs, data does not match the narrative)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The leader is not accountable to any authorities.
(Fauci, Brix, WHO, CDC, Cooper, et.al.  They have NO accountability.  They can change their minds, go back and forth, back track and EVERYONE just keeps going along with them?!?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The leadership/members induce feelings of shame and/or guilt in order to influence and control members.  Often done through peer pressure and subtle forms of persuasion.
(Wear your mask or risk passing it to family member and YOU will kill grandma and have to live with that guilt.  Calling off holiday celebrations because you were told to, missing out on memories you will never get again.  Stay away from people, especially non-maskers, they can infect you and you will infect others.  Pressure friends to follow the masks mandate, call them names, embarrass them at every turn. If you are a grown ass man...go tattle on another MAN that doesn't follow the mask fraud!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Members are encouraged or required to live/or socialize only with other group members.
(Do not go near a non-masker, demand family they must wear a mask at gatherings even if all of them think it is a fraud or keep children, grandchildren from them until they comply.  Talk with each other about your strategies to reduce covid using your masks, etc....but immediately turn away from anyone that shares the opposite view point...shun them, make them feel unwanted.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If most of these apply to you...do some DEEP reflecting within.</p>
<p>What are you really doing?
The directions you are following, are they really helping?
Do you go with the orders and mandates given just to avoid confrontation with family and other  people in the community?
If you are...then you are as complicit in this game as the ones that believe it; hook, line, and sinker!</p></p>

        <p>At the beginning, I politely and calmly tried to debate people, and show evidence at how stupid this whole Scamdemic has been.</p>
<p>That didn't work, which made me greatly question my faith in humanity.</p>

        <p>There are two types of intelligence.  The one that we have been trained to value most by this sick society is a kind of instrumental logic which is simply the outgrowth of animal cunning. The other is the ability to see overarching trends and it is this which separates (some) humans from animals.  </p>
<p>"The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift. We will not solve the problems of the world from the same level of thinking we were at when we created them. More than anything else, this new century demands new thinking: we must change our materially based analyses of the world around us to include broader, more multidimensional perspectives" - Einstein (really)</p>

        <p>Cults are the group dynamic of evil. As evil is spreading through society, cult like dynamics are cropping up everywhere, from SJW cancel culture, to covid cultists. It's all related to the same root pathology in lack of good will.</p>
