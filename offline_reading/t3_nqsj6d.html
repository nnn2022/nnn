    <strong>"Has it been on the news? It might not be true if it hasn't"</strong>
    <p><p>Its starting to get really irritating with family and friends. So much shit I have said and they haven't believed me, they've  actually called me crazy, only for what I've said to actually happen. </p>
<p>You'd just think that after so many warnings, before things happen, that they'd maybe stop and think "I didn't believe her last time and she was right, maybe there's truth in this" and actually look it up instead of just jumping to thinking I am crazy and full of shit again! </p>
<p>I warned my sister of the NHS about to share our medical data with third parties. She didn't believe me until she seen it on Facebook. Fucking Facebook. I tell a friend the same thing and she asks me if it has been on the news. I do not watch the news. So I sent her articles. Her response was "well, if it hasn't been on the news then maybe it isn't true" 
Fuck my life! I told her to call the bastard doctors surgery for confirmation if she thinks I'm bullshitting her. </p>
<p>They only believe what the media tells them and if the media decides to keep things on the quiet until its too late, then what good is that? That's what they've done with the NHS thing. I dont think it has hit the news yet, and if it has, it is not as big as it should be. </p>
<p>They can fuck off from now on. Its not worth feeling like shit knowing that they think I'm crazy. I dont understand what they think I have to gain from lying to them. I do not understand why they can't look this shit up themselves. I wouldnt mind them thinking I was crazy then. Prove that I am fucking crazy! At least then they would be actually looking shit up themselves instead of relying on the box filled with lies.</p></p>

        <p>They are brainwashed by the mass media's false veneer of authoritativeness. You know the truth, don't beat yourself up trying to get others to be less asleep. It's a common issue with the masses unfortunately, if the media isn't talking about it, then it doesn't exist. I think even just encouraging less time online or watching the news cycle would do wonders for reviving the average joe's critical thinking skills.</p>

Yup, 1 month without the media telling them what is what and they'd feel like new people.</p>

        <p>There’s a great study showing 75% of people do not have an internal monologue. That voice that asks questions and tells you that you need more information.. is only found in 25% of the population. </p>

        <p>I knew some people didn't have an internal monologue, but jesus christ 75% is not what I'd of expected. I guess that explains why we come across more people who are brainwashed than we do with the virus.</p>
<p>I'd also like to see a larger study done!</p>

        <p>I know this sounds like a weird question but I'm working a hypothesis that people who can't see the obvious agenda have Endocannabinoid Deficiency Syndrome (as humans also produce their own cannabinoids which is what the "runner's high" is... but not everyone is capable of producing them.) </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do they smoke weed? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do they have chonic headaches, irritable bowl syndrome, or fibromyalgia?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These conditions in particular don't have a known cause and are called central sensitivity syndromes; sharing chronic pain, and effect multiple area of the body (all containing endocannabinoid receptors)...thought to be caused by a lack of endocannabinoids.</p>
<p><em>The ECS also promotes neuron growth and neuroplasticity which slows greatly once we reach 25. This could explain why people aren't able to forge new lines of thought and just appear as a zombie.</em></p>

        <p>Too many people are so cooked in the brain and going insane now.  I totally feel what you are saying. 
It’s pointless trying to wake them up, or many of them at least.  Things will get really bad soon, then maybe they will finally open their fucking eyes, most not though. Deer in the headlights syndrome as it seems.<br>
Take care of YOU now and the ones who are aware of this madness.  Stay strong and know in your heart that you are not alone. Many of us are aware.</p>
