    <strong>Is there any way to look at how different countries classify Covid deaths?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m in the UK and we classify any deaths within 28 days of a Covid positive test as a Covid death. You can view this information/definition of a Covid death on the UK government website.</p>
<p>In the US, I believe it’s similar but can vary state-by-state, I believe you can also view the definition of a Covid death on the CDC website.</p>
<p>But aside from these 2 countries, I’m not sure if many other countries define what a Covid death is on their government website? At least from my little bit of searching. I’ve tried looking on German, Japanese and a few other countries’ government websites but unable to find how they classify Covid deaths.</p>
<p>If anyone knows of any information on how different countries classify a ‘Covid death’, I’d be really interested to see it. I suspect most nations do make their counting method publicly available but it’s just hard to find if you’re not sure where to look as a foreigner.</p>
<p>It would also shed a lot of light on vastly different death rates etc.</p></p>
