    <strong>I will consciously object to receive a COVID vaccine : doing otherwise would be the highest form of endorsement of the lockdown groupthink.</strong>
    <p><p><em>Disclaimer: I am NOT against COVID vaccines per se. These vaccines seem to be (at least for now) effective for preventing severe forms of COVID, as well as </em><em>reducing</em><em> transmission. My position isn't at all an attack on the science behind these vaccines. My objection here is philosophical &amp;amp; political. This should NOT be interpreted as an anti-vax piece.</em></p>
<p>I'm 19 years old, living in a province (Québec, Canada) that has marched on our rights every single day of the last 14 months and where domestic vaccine passports are gonna be a thing. I closely followed the COVID situation since January 2020 as a radio columnist and has been against lockdowns since the very beginning.</p>
<p><strong>I will NOT take the vaccine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I believe that doing so is equivalent to endorse &amp;amp; exonerate what has been done these past 14 months.</strong></p>
<p>Why so?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>I am NOT significantly at risk.</strong></p>
<p>My risk of dying of COVID, or being hospitalized, is very low. Even if it wasn't the case, that risk assessment is mine to make, like any other health decision. I never considered myself at risk for severe flu, so I never took the flu shot. Even if COVID risk is a bit higher, that is a risk I am prepared to live with, so I will make the same choice. That liberty of choice should remain, and forcing yourself to please the majority is setting a bad precedent for it. If you really wanna protect yourself, fair enough ; if you don't, please stand your ground. Values that underpin these rights survived history because people who had belief in their utility acted according to their conscience. Please don't break this cultural chain.</p>
<p><strong>2. Vaccines are, explicitly or implicitly, imposed as the condition for the end of lockdowns.</strong></p>
<p>That's a big one, and you should certainly think about it.  Like, a lot. They impose mass vaccination as a criteria for the end of this shitshow. This is their narrative : lockdowns will end BECAUSE we will be massively vaccinated. As much as you probably want this to end, taking the vaccine to help satisfy the threshold is total submission to their fatally flawed worldview. You are giving them the final gift to wrap this up as a good health policy. Lockdowns don't exist in autarky : there the product of a deeper cultural shift (at least for authorities). If you are deeply against lockdowns and they have done to us all,  like me, acting according to their narrative <strong>is</strong> confirming its validity. Actions matter more than words, they determine the cultural &amp;amp; political landscape in which we are gonna live, after all this.</p>
<p><strong>3. Personal protection conferred by vaccines, to those at risk, is enough to bring the risk of COVID below the threshold for it being considered an health emergency</strong></p>
<p>I think I don't even need to justify this one. COVID is a almost a non-issue for the young and healthy and now that the others are protected by their vaccines, their health should not be my burden anymore. It's the responsibility of our healthcare system, like any other disease with a similar risk than "COVID in a vaccinated individual". Florida understood it. Herd immunity (by vaccines) is unlikely, and it is not necessary for COVID to be considered a <em>normal</em> risk. Accepting the vaccine as a young and healthy person who is against lockdown groupthink is equivalent to endorsing, by your actions, the narrative that underpins it. It's accepting that there is still an health emergency to which I am morally obligated to remedy. When at-risk groups are vaccinated, this is NOT the case anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Consenting to being saved is, at its core, admitting that we needed to be saved in the first place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consenting to protect ourselves from something that is not risky is letting irrational fear dominate our culture.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The primary side-effects of our individual vaccination choices are political and cultural, not medical.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm not surrendering to lockdown groupthink. I will not cross the line into the New Normal.</strong></p>
<p><em>Edit: Considering that there is a possibility that mass vaccination combined with the apparition of immune escape in the next months lead to VAED (vaccine-enhanced disease), my initial disclaimer was not quite correct. I’m not that worried about side-effects, but I’m worried about this. You should be too.</em></p></p>

        <p>Good job, fellow Quebecer, I will not accept coercion, vaccine passport / mandate. I will also not take this vaccine because we have safe and effective cures like Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin and Vitamin D. All things that the QC government censor and block access too. Makes you wonder what the hell is going on. I think I know partially the answer to that.</p>

        <p>Albertan here. Same train. The idea that our rights can be set aside for a government defined "emergency" is bafflingly authoritarian. </p>
<p>"So we have a charter of rights and freedoms to protect us from oppression and authoritarianism?"</p>
<p><em>"Yes"</em></p>
<p>"It applies at all times?"</p>
<p><em>"Well, not unless it's an emergency situation. Then we can suspend them for the sake of the people."</em></p>
<p>"And who gets to define what constitutes as an emergency?"</p>
<p><em>"The government."</em></p>
<p>"So the exact entity that shouldn't have that power because it is likely to be the very thing that leads to authoritarianism?"</p>
<p><em>"Yeah, that thing"</em></p>
