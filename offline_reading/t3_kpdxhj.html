    <strong>What will you all do when this is our permanent normal?</strong>
    <p><p>Bitching on reddit won't do anything and you guys won't do much in person besides maybe not wear a mask. You're all to scared to actually stand up</p></p>

        <p>This is a very good question.</p>
<p>It pretty much is our permanent normal, there is no end in sight.</p>
<p>I will vote for any politician and party that is anti lockdown even though I have no faith in the system I will be doing it as a gesture of support to anyone who is willing to stand up against this. </p>
<p>I will continue to not comply, ie not wear a mask, see my friends, travel, go to the gym that's refusing to close, support any business that is refusing to close. Mass compliance is our way out of this.</p>
<p>I don't know what else to do. If I owned a business I would refuse to close it. If there weren't things tying me to this country I would move to Sweden.</p>
<p>I agree with you about the mask thing. It's so depressing to see people on this sub being too scared to not wear a mask. What's the point of being awake to the bs if you can't do the bare minimum of not complying?</p>

        <p>The problem is me not wearing a mask can result in me being fired and losing eve I’ve worked for and all the money I’ve paid in tuition. I can’t afford to destroy my life and livelihood just to make a point.</p>

        <p>If there were any type of protest near me I would be involved right now!</p>
<p>I already go Mask free everywhere and I even make it a point to smile and talk to strangers more than I ever did before. </p>
<p>I’d like to do more but I do not know what I can do.</p>
