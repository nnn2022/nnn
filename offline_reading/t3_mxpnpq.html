    <strong>Kicked out</strong>
    <p><p>Due to the lock downs all publicly funded places such as Library’s, Museum’s, conservatories ect are still closed. Despite it being just that. Publicly funded. Regardless, I’d still like to experience some kind of life with my wife and 1 year old daughter. We set out to tour green houses... boring I know, but my little girl loves flowers so I’m in. The place is crawling. And I mean crawling.. due to everybody being locked out of most aspects of life. I only made it about 20 feet into the green house before I was asked if I had a facing covering. I replied no. I was then directed to the front of the store to grab a mask or face shield to which I politely told the young lady “No I won’t be doing that either”. At which time I was told I had to leave. I’m not surprised by what happened. Infact it happens a lot. It’s just crazy that Canada. A country I went overseas and fought a pointless war for is now a place where a father will be told he isn’t welcome with his daughter because he isn’t wearing a non medical device over his face. In the future when everybody is forced to have these experimental vaccines and what ever other corrupt craziness may occur, at least I can look my little girl in the face and tell her that I’m sorry everything is the way it is, but I didn’t comply. I didn’t add to her now dystopian life.</p></p>

        <p>Unfortunately I think you’ll be waiting for a long time my friend. Unless I’m just being fooled by the media I see an overwhelming amount of bootlickers all around me. I understand that no country is perfect and without issues, but I never thought I’d see the day where I could 100% say. I am ashamed of being Canadian.</p>

with y’all’s skepticism on vaccines, but some of this behavior is just anti-social. You knew the fight you were picking and you did it anyway like a goober just to get online and cry about it.</p>

        <p>It’s not anti social. In fact I was literally trying to go into a social setting. Just without a mask. I’m not happy to be kicked out because I refuse to.. and I can’t believe I even have to defend this.. wear a mask when outside of my home around other human beings. Masks aren’t even effective at stopping this flu. If you think complying with every rule put into place is going to make things go back to the way they were before, I believe you are wrong.</p>

        <p>Whether masks are effective is outside the scope of what I’m saying. The people you were around either believe they were effective and were complying out of that belief, or simply charged with enforcing the mask rule as a policy of the greenhouse. You knew that going in maskless would cause them some discomfort and distress, but you wanted to do it anyway to make your point. In essence you were happy to inconvenience others to stroke your own ego. Thus — antisocial.</p>

        <p>Fair enough. Those are all valid points. I did go into the green house full well knowing that there was a very real possibly of being kicked out. I also did know that going in maskless would cause discomfort and distress. I can honestly (as honestly as one can to a total stranger on Reddit) tell you that it was not a ego thing. I get no sense of satisfaction of being the odd man out. I’m not comfortable going into crowded places either as the only guy with no mask. I’m doing it because I feel like it’s the right thing to do. That’s it.</p>
