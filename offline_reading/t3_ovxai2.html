        <p>You don't debate. Debating gives merit to the idea that others have any right to tell you what treatments to take. They don't. You just politely say that you aren't interested at this time, and if asked why just say that you aren't a doctor or scientist and don't feel comfortable sharing your position. They can't hold you down and jab you, so you are under no obligation to win a debate.</p>

        <p>Yeah I just say there is no benefit for me. I don't want to break my parents faith in it either because they are finally starting to let some of the fear go with it. We'll see if it holds strong this next news cycle though.</p>

        <p>99%? From the beginning of this pandemic perhaps... what is the date range of comparison?  I don’t see it presented in the article.</p>
<p>What I’m specifically asking for is the date range they’ve collected this data and breakdown of vaxxed/unvaxxed.  </p>
<p>They’ve been playing fast and loose with figures not providing any data set.</p>
<p>Edit:  the slides from the CDC are using death totals beginning 1/2020.  See for yourself.  They’re purposely manipulating the data to fit their narrative.  Unbelievable.</p>

        <p>"I'm young, healthy, and unafraid of a virus with a stupidly high survival rate."</p>
<p>As far as the "99% of Covid deaths are now of unvaccinated people", that's great. That's what's supposed to happen if the vaccine is as safe and effective as advertised, right? Naturally, almost all the deaths (and cases) will be consisting of those who didn't take the vaccine. This means that those who are vaccinated have incredibly little reason to be afraid of this virus any longer, or be afraid of the unvaccinated. If someone's still freaked out, they can feel free to take any and all personal precautions necessary to make them feel safe, just like before the vaccine was available. And then go back to living a normal life. Or don't, and can feel free to live inside for the rest of their life.</p>

        <p>so lets pretend this number is real. its leaving out deaths from the vaccine, and of those of us who get covid still have over 99.8% chance of survival. </p>
<p>i am young, i exercise every day, i take vitamins and have no pre existing conditions. I’m more likely to be killed by a car than covid. </p>
<p>its been established that the vaccine doesnt prevent transmission, just makes it a little less intense. if you are old, obese, or have respiratory problems, maybe the vaccine is worth it.</p>

        <p>TLDR;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The vaccines have not been tested thoroughly and the incentive for companies to lie about them has never been greater (+no liability if anything goes wrong)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I infect someone who has been vaccinated, me being vaccinated would probably not have stopped that from happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Dirty" Communities are far more evolutionary competitive than "Quarantined and Vaccinated" Communities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>.1. In the short term: with the amount of money on the line there's never in the history of humanity been bigger incentive for pharmaceutical companies to tinker with results and claim that their vaccine which they put together for SC-2 in less than a year is 99% effective (which even with vaccines for other pathogens, especially flu-like viruses, that have been refined for decades, is extremely unlikely). There is a reason medication and especially vaccines get clinically tested for around a decade before they are allowed to go public (there are loads of examples of things going wrong in the past). The icing on the cake being that the companies which likely lied about their results will not be held liable if anything goes wrong with the vaccine anytime soon. If you are over the age of 40, have children, and/or have an ubderlying condition then the vaccine could save your life. If you do wish to take a vaccine in the near future and don't fall into the vulnerable demographic there's nothing wrong with waiting a couple years to see some real proof that there are no short-term, or even long-term, side-effects.</p>
<p>.2. If you are vaccinated, you are as safe as you possibly can be from succumbing to C-19. Me being vaccinated or not has nothing to do with your ability to fight off the virus. If I get infected (and infect you) with a variant that the vaccine doesn't protect against, then me being vaccinated would not have stopped that from happening.</p>
<p>.3. LONG TERM &amp; THE KILLINTG TRUTH: if you have 2 communities side by side; one of which vaccinates and suppresses a pathogen while the other harbors and "breeds" them. Within a couple of generations you'll have one community which is reliant on a vaccine to elicit a proper immune-response while the other does so naturally (as all individuals in that community that could not handle the pathogen were unable to pass on their immune systems). The "dirty" community will have bred many variants to the pathogen that will have evolved to be more succesful at infiltrating human-immune-systems while the immune-systems of that dirty community will also have co-evolved to be more adept at handling those variants. As we've seen last year it takes more than a year to get a working vaccine to the masses so when one of the variants from the "dirty" communities innevitably makes it's way into the "clean" community, the "clean" community will have an incredibly hard time dealing with this new variant naturally. We have evidence for how deadly such an interaction can be with the "Colombian Exchange" when all the "dirty" world-fairing, plague ridden, european travelers made their way to the quarantined Native Americans, Khoisan, Aboriginees etc. and ended up decimating their communities with the flu's and other pathogens they had been breeding for the past generations (with many "clean" communities loosing more than 90% of their population to these pathogens that the "dirty" communities had bred). So a "dirty" community is much more evolutionarily competitve than a continually quarantined and vaccinated community. Note that if a pathogen is eradicable it is in the best interest of the world to eradicate it; but we aren't even able to feed the whole world let alone get everyone to quarantined and vaccinated (all in a couple weeks time) so it is inevitable that the pathogen will gain resistance to a vaccine or treatment and that especially a flu-like virus is still impossible to eradicate. If a pathogen can not be eradicated the "dirty" community will always outsurvive a "clean" community. What I'm really saying is that the relationship between pathogens and social communities (like the ones humans have) are actually hugely mutually-symbiotic; one civilization has never wielded a more deadly weapon over another civilization than disease. What is a normal flu-like virus for one community (like influenza and rhino are now) could be a death sentence to a community that has never learned to cope with those viruses. I believe SC2 will very soon be part of this flu-group (killing the exact same demograpic) and that it will continue to evolve in pockets all around the world. So, if a pathogen doesn't stop evolving, are we so arrogant to believe we don't have to? (So personally, if I had an immune-system that could not handle SC2 i believe it's better for the future of humanity if i didn't have children)... Not to mention "dirty" communities who interact with a wide variety of pathogens are much more adept to dealing with the next inevitable outbreak (e.g. communities that go through SC2 naturally probably have a much better chance at surviving the next "Sars" pandemic, whether it's MERS -which officially has a 40%+ mortality rate- or any other pathogen that affect our cytokines or the rest of our immune-systems in a similar way)...</p>

<p>In the short term: with the amount of money on the line there's never in the history of humanity been bigger incentive for pharmaceutical companies to tinker with results and claim that their vaccine which they put together for SC-2 in less than a year is 99% effective (which even with vaccines for other pathogens, especially flu-like viruses, that have been refined for decades, is extremely unlikely). There is a reason medication and especially vaccines get clinically tested for around a decade before they are allowed to go public (there are loads of examples of things going wrong in the past). The icing on the cake being that the companies which likely lied about their results will not be held liable if anything goes wrong with the vaccine anytime soon. If you are over the age of 40, have children, and/or have an ubderlying condition then the vaccine could save your life. If you do wish to take a vaccine in the near future and don't fall into the vulnerable demographic there's nothing wrong with waiting a couple years to see some real proof that there are no short-term, or even long-term, side-effects.</p>

<p>If you are vaccinated, you are as safe as you possibly can be from succumbing to C-19. Me being vaccinated or not has nothing to do with your ability to fight off the virus. If I get infected (and infect you) with a variant that the vaccine doesn't protect against, then me being vaccinated would not have stopped that from happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LONG TERM &amp; THE KILLINTG TRUTH: if you have 2 communities side by side; one of which vaccinates and suppresses a pathogen while the other harbors and "breeds" them. Within a couple of generations you'll have one community which is reliant on a vaccine to elicit a proper immune-response while the other does so naturally (as all individuals in that community that could not handle the pathogen were unable to pass on their immune systems). The "dirty" community will have bred many variants to the pathogen that will have evolved to be more succesful at infiltrating human-immune-systems while the immune-systems of that dirty community will also have co-evolved to be more adept at handling those variants. As we've seen last year it takes more than a year to get a working vaccine to the masses so when one of the variants from the "dirty" communities innevitably makes it's way into the "clean" community, the "clean" community will have an incredibly hard time dealing with this new variant naturally. We have evidence for how deadly such an interaction can be with the "Colombian Exchange" when all the "dirty" world-fairing, plague ridden, european travelers made their way to the quarantined Native Americans, Khoisan, Aboriginees etc. and ended up decimating their communities with the flu's and other pathogens they had been breeding for the past generations (with many "clean" communities loosing more than 90% of their population to these pathogens that the "dirty" communities had bred). So a "dirty" community is much more evolutionarily competitve than a continually quarantined and vaccinated community. Note that if a pathogen is eradicable it is in the best interest of the world to eradicate it; but we aren't even able to feed the whole world let alone get everyone to quarantined and vaccinated (all in a couple weeks time) so it is inevitable that the pathogen will gain resistance to a vaccine or treatment and that especially a flu-like virus is still impossible to eradicate. If a pathogen can not be eradicated the "dirty" community will always outsurvive a "clean" community. What I'm really saying is that the relationship between pathogens and social communities (like the ones humans have) are actually hugely mutually-symbiotic; one civilization has never wielded a more deadly weapon over another civilization than disease. What is a normal flu-like virus for one community (like influenza and rhino are now) could be a death sentence to a community that has never learned to cope with those viruses. I believe SC2 will very soon be part of this flu-group (killing the exact same demograpic) and that it will continue to evolve in pockets all around the world. So, if a pathogen doesn't stop evolving, are we so arrogant to believe we don't have to? (So personally, if I had an immune-system that could not handle SC2 i believe it's better for the future of humanity if i didn't have children)... Not to mention "dirty" communities who interact with a wide variety of pathogens have a higher chance of surviving the next inevitable outbreak (e.g. communities that go through SC2 naturally probably have a much better chance at surviving the next "Sars" pandemic, whether it's MERS -which officially has a 40%+ mortality rate- or any other pathogen that affect our cytokines or the rest of our immune-systems in a similar way)...</p>
