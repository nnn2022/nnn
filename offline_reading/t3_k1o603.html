    <strong>I wonder who actually had a zoom thanksgiving</strong>
    <p><p>Our thanksgiving celebrations are typically small every year, with four people total. My family is a little more doomer than me, and I was worried thanksgiving would be an issue, but I think even the doomers have limits, at least most of them.</p>
<p>I’m wondering who actually sat at home all by themselves and had a zoom thanksgiving as Lord Fauci (mask be upon him) and other saints pleaded. Then they went back to playing video games in their custom gamer chairs, masturbating furiously, and ordering bulk Cheetohs from Walmart.</p></p>

        <p>Has to be the biggest losers of all time. My family takes it seriously (though I'm slowly showing them the light) and they don't care at all about having Thanksgiving being "dangerous". Perfectly fine with it.</p>

        <p>I’ve seen people post on social media their “Zoom Thanksgiving” pictures. Along with a cheesy virtue caption to add along how are they thankful for everyone keeping safe. Go figure.</p>

        <p>Does it count if I didn't even do that? I slept in, watched like half of the parade, watched the Texans/Lions game, and played with my dog all day...not making any Thanksgiving food since it's just me, but making him a batch of pumpkin cupcakes currently...my family's all over the country and/or we're not on good terms currently and my roommate's gone, so yeah, just me and my dog, no socializing, not even virtually.</p>

        <p>I pretty much never see my family on Thanksgiving because of work so we are used to video chatting on this day anyways but I’ve seen cars lining many residential streets in my city today and saw many large families gathering at the park with tons of food since it’s like 72 degrees and sunny where I am today. Amazing day to celebrate outside tbh not because the government said to. My city feels completely normal for a thanksgiving and that is what I’m giving thanks for today!</p>
