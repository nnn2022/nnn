        <p>Honestly only people who are at risk of dying from covid should get it, like older people or people with weaker immune systems or any kind of sickness that makes them more likely to die because 1. It makes it harder for those who really need it to get it and 2. What's the point of putting shit into your body when it won't effect anything?</p>
<p>I really don't get why so many healthy bodied people want to take it so badly or celebrate when taking, my guess is they think it'd just bring things back to normal</p>

        <p>The experimental injections haven't gone through the same rigorous testing as other treatments for me to say anyone really needs these injections.</p>
<p>There are alternative treatment options available that are both effective and safer to use than these experimental injections.</p>

        <p>The only testing I know of is companies giving the vaccine to a hundred people and then having another hundred that were told they were given the vaccine, and if I am remembering this correctly most of the tests the group who toke the vaccine had less than a quarter covid infection rates of the non vaccinated groups and in the vaccinated group 0 people died of covid, I do think it should help but like I said healthy bodied people have 0 use for it and are just putting junk in them</p>
