        <p>You forgot to mention that if the hospital is using PCR testing in the 38-45 cycle threshold you are looking at a likely 90% false positive rate.</p>
<p>So not only are they not being admitted for Covid, they don’t even have enough of it in their system to make anyone else sick.</p>

        <p>I have been wondering that myself. I came to the conclusion that maybe they want to believe it, on some level. So what’s the pay off? Not having to take responsibility for your own health for one. A convenient scape goat is being created, which is always useful when things are going sideways. Looking at the truth and examining the real real problems is time consuming, expensive and hard work. ‘Everyone’ wants a quick fix.</p>
<p>Edit: For clarity there are probably lots of reason and this just one probable contributing element. I am not a panacea for this clown world we are openly witnessing right now which we have relatively recently entered into.</p>

        <p>We already knew this. The death certificates stated 'died with covid' and not 'died from covid'. It's mainly dumbasses that don't have the necessary reading comprehension skills to understand this.</p>
