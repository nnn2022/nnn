    <strong>The damage is permanent. The normies are too blind to see it.</strong>
    <p><p>Well, back from yet another account suspension. I'd like to say it's good to see all of you again, and to the Reddit Admins, a hearty "Kiss my fucking ass!"</p>
<p>Anyhoo...</p>
<p>Even if you don't believe in The Great Reset, even if you don't believe in Agenda 2030, even if you don't believe our governments and elites aren't using this fake pandemic for their own ends - you have to understand one simple truth:</p>
<p>Society won't come back from this. The damage is too deep.</p>
<p>- We have completely destroyed the generations from 10 to 25 years of age. Their psyches will never recover from the lockdowns, the isolation, the fear, the growing dependence on government largesse. When they are old enough to vote (assuming that will still be a thing), they will be coming for your remaining freedoms with fire and sword. When they are old enough to attain power, they will destroy us.</p>
<p>- Trust is dead. Whether between neighbours, co-workers, people and governments, people and institutions... it's done. Human nature at its most foul and base has come out in the open - snitching, bullying, gaslighting, use of other's misery to one's own advantage - the genie isn't going back into the bottle. You can remove the masks, you can remove the "social" distancing, but you won't be able to remove the divide between those who sold out, and those who suffered and were demonized by their fellow man. There will be blood.</p>
<p>- Democracy (such as it was) is dead. Politicians have finally found the silver bullet (fear of death/disease) to make the populace beg for their chains. Every loophole, every "interpretation" of constitutional documents, every end-run around proper processes and safeguards has come out into the open - and most of the populace doesn't care. Give them Netflix, cheap drugs and booze, DoorDash, and a check every month, and they will happily load the "deniers" and "heretics" onto the cattle cars. The window of successful resistance is closing day by day. But there will be resistance. How successful it will be, only time will tell.</p>
<p>- Science is dead. It has become simply another political tool of the elites, to be spun, corrupted, and co-opted to suit whatever agenda is the flavour of the day. Dissent and kiss your grants, your funding, your platforms, your employment goodbye. It started with AIDS, gained a mass following with "global warming", gained more and more power with the "trans" movement, and is triumphant with the manufacturing of ChinaVirus hysteria. Science is whatever the man paying the bills says it is - just like the Medieval Church. Half the population are blind followers, half see the bullshit for what it is. The two sides will eventually go to war.</p>
<p>- Individual responsibility, innovation, and the Middle Class are dead. In less than 70 years, the freest, most prosperous, most open society to ever exist has been reduced to servitude. Small businesses won't come back - who in this current climate of government caprice, micromanagement, and uncertainty will roll the dice? Even if the Scam-Demic "ends", does anyone have any confidence in the future? We now have government big enough to give citizens everything - and to take it all away. And they are coming to take it all - your car, your house, your freedom of speech, your freedom to question and to think...</p>
<p>Even if The Virus is gone tomorrow, and "victory" is declared, the old life isn't coming back. It doesn't matter whether you believe (as I do) that this is by design, or if you believe it's just a malign coincidence, the end result will be the same.</p>

        <p>I see three major issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone blames everyone else for killing and / or impoverishing their loved ones.</li>
<li>A majority have paranoid delusions due to relentless, fact-free fear porn (e.g. people under sixty still thinking they have a &rt; 10% risk of dying from a random encounter on the street).</li>
<li>The concentration of wealth has reached near-Bronze Age levels. It isn't seventy years' progress that's been undone, at least not in material parity; it's three thousand.</li>
</ol>
<p>These all need to be resolved for us to have even a <em>chance</em> of peace amid a 10 - 30% economic downturn, yet no-one wants to even talk about them.</p>

        <p>I think there are only 2 scenarios for "peace":</p>
<p>- They destroy us, or at least completely cow us into silence.</p>
<p>- We go our separate ways, and reform into smaller units and societies that suit us.</p>
<p>Overthrowing their tyranny will only delay the inevitable, as they will simply keep working behind the scenes to enslave us yet again, and use our desire for a free and open society against us - as so many groups have been doing in the last 50 years.</p>
<p>They will not let us go freely, as we will take the majority of the intelligent, productive, and moral citizenry with us. They will lose face - and revenue.</p>
<p>So I don't foresee "peace" in our futures...</p>

        <p>I am 100% with you on the smaller units. People talk about America breaking up as if it’s a terrible thing. I think it would be great. A split into two parts would be a start but even smaller independent states would be ideal. The EU breaking up is an absolute necessity.</p>

        <p>Your third point is almost entirely due to the Fed. The manner in which they "print" money is by buying assets with money they granted themselves, which drives up the prices of assets (stocks, real estate, etc.) and makes anyone who already owned them relatively richer. Stagnant wages aren't due to a generation of unusually greedy business owners, but rather the wages are correctly valued but assets are over inflated. Socialists then push rhetoric that blames this on <em>all</em> rich people (instead of on the connected people who got wealthy because of who they knew instead of what they created) and demand wealth redistribution, but that will make the problem worse and further enrich the connected class like what happened in every socialist country in history. The way to fix this is to stop handing control of our currency and economy to corrupt bureaucrats.</p>

        <p>My opinion on this is it's the children on the younger side that are most likely to have the biggest scars from all this.</p>
<p>They are the ones not really understanding what is happening around them, and they are in the most important development stages of their live. Everything feeds their subconscious at torrent speed while they rely on everyone around them telling them what to do and what to believe.</p>
<p>It might not look like it right now, but all these things will come out as they grow up, and it won't be pretty to see.</p>

        <p>I agree for the most part, but it might also have the opposite effect on some kids. They might grow up to become rebellious and distrust authority, and things will be so fucked they have nothing to lose. We’ve see this in a lot of kids who have authoritarian parents and in places like East Germany. The majority will probably be a bunch of submissive hypochondriacs though.</p>

        <p>Yes and it's also how I see it, but everything that is done is base on the majority agreeing with it.</p>
<p>As long as they have the masses following their ways, they don't give a damn about the rebellious minority. The majority will fight these rebellious themselves on top of it. Just like we see it now.</p>

        <p>Some kids will resent this, most will not.</p>
<p>Trust me. I used to be in a support group for children of abusive parents. Most of them were still in denial they were abused, loved their parents, still <em>served</em> their parents, and so on. I even got chastized myself for saying I hated my parents, and will never forgive them. People are ignorant and gullible, and they often side with their abusers even when they claim they don't.</p>

        <p>I'm 24 so not exactly a kid. But Covid has made me rebellious, resenting authority and rules, untrusting of anything the government or media says, and very critical of anyone who follows the narrative. The damage has been done and is irreversible. And in a way I'm grateful for it because now we can see people and agencies for who they really are.</p>

        <p>I too just have anecdotal evidence with my high school aged nieces and nephews, but it sounds like most of them mock the hysteria and just want things back to normal. Maybe that's just how it is in rural areas. Homecoming dance was cancelled by the school, so they had an underground dance instead</p>

<p>However, in the last few months, I have seen much more compliance and hysteria even from the teenagers. Seems they were likely beaten into submission, and put fear into them by parents, the media, etc.</p>

        <p>I think people are far too comfortable, which makes it a lot easier to go along with the Great Reset and "saving the world" from a fake pandemic by stripping humanity of everything that matters the most. As long as they can order a pizza and have it delivered in 15 minutes and have their trashy netflix sitcoms, not a whole lot of change will happen I don't think. I don't doubt the elites who profited the most from this will overhype viruses in the future, now that they know how easy it is to get the masses to comply. It took the Soviet Union nearly a century to fall because the sad truth is people either don't want to be free that badly, or not enough are willing to stand up and fight when it comes down to it. Hopefully, it will not come down to that. I truly believe the power elite are willing to stop at nothing to enslave the globe. As long as we can communicate the danger openly, I see hope. Just in the past months, Ive seen a lot more people in my personal life lose their legitimacy in the system from having their lives ruined by this phony virus. More people are slowly waking up, but it will take time.</p>

        <p>Absolutely true - the sheeple are far too comfortable in their servitude. But that will change.</p>
<p>The elites are not going to waste money paying UBI for "useless mouths" forever. They only need so many serfs, so many techs, and so many bureaucrats. In their society, AI and robots will make most of the population redundant - a net liability.</p>
<p>The sheeple will be in for a massive shock, a massive drop in living standards - and a massive cull.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union was brought down by external, not internal forces - it simply couldn't match Western military and tech spending (like Star Wars/SDI), and bankrupted itself trying. There was no revolution from within (the satellite states are a separate matter).</p>
<p>Once the global elites gain control, there will be no external force to bring them down. Tyranny without end.</p>

<p>As long as the Soviet leadership could keep some food on everyone's table, ensured they had "work" where no one asked too much, and kept them in cheap vodka and smokes, the illusion could go on forever.</p>

        <p>First of all we should not overreact like that. You have to stay chill to properly read the situation. No, we can’t say something so doomer as “there’s no going back”. True, it stunted a lot of people for sure, but let’s say media comes on and says it’s over. I bet tons of sheep will take off their masks and forget about it. I might be wrong too, but we don’t know what will happen tomorrow and it’s wrong to try</p>

        <p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>People here can be so foolish.</p>
<p>Even if things "opened up" tomorrow, and masks and other restrictions are 100% dropped, life is not magically going back to 2019 status quo. Life has become a fucked up mess, and this is going to leave deep scars for us forever.</p>

        <p>That's the thing, even if people take their masks off and drop the social distancing we won't forget the snitching and bullying done by them. The sheer amount of times these sad and lonely people snitched on a fucking kids birthday party makes my blood boil.</p>

        <p>Literally turned this country into a third world shithole in every aspect imaginable. </p>
<p>Shortage of certain goods. Stores not stocking up for weeks or even months. </p>
<p>Shitty customer service, no more returns of goods in most stores, like of which you can expect to see in Iraq or Afghanistan. </p>
<p>Hour long hold times on the phone for every goddamn business or government agency. </p>
<p>Slow and even more inefficient government agancies such as DMV.</p>
<p>Hotels and restaurants limiting their amenities to take advantage of this bullshit hoax. No more free refills, no more free breakfast, no more everyday housekeeping at most hotels. Very limited hours pool access. </p>
<p>Hyperinflation. USD has fallen ~25% against ALL major foreign currencies. </p>
<p>US passport is as valuable as Zimbabwe passport. A US passport holder used to be able to travel to 143 countries visa-free. Now, almost nowhere. </p>
<p>The only reason I didn't mention freedoms is that you covered it well. The constitution means absolutely nothing anymore. The sheep proved they don't want nor do they deserve any of the freedoms granted to them by the bill of rights. </p>

<p>Funny you specifically mentioned that. I've been tossing around the idea of doing a post related to this. I did three tours in Afghanistan, and really notice how our society is starting to look and behave more and more like that place.</p>

        <p>I think that myopic "orthodox thought" has caused all of this. Both orthodox religious and orthodox (so called) "scientific" thought. Einstein said that "We cannot solve our problems with the same <strong>level</strong> <strong>of</strong> thinking that created them." Either mankind finds a different level of thinking or your doom laden prophesy will come to pass. There will be strife whatever happens.</p>

        <p>See, the concept of the Tower of Babel is a perpetual thing. Whether you're looking at it from a historico-mythological perspective or a religious one, Babylon's tower never fell for good. It has been built back up over the last few thousand years and it is close to the metaphorical clouds once more. Those at the very top of it however do not wish it to fall once more, they would rather have those below them perpetually supporting it, for eternity. Even if the tower was to crumble once more, those at the top will try to find a way to survive it, and begin building it anew, with new slaves, once more. In a way, the tower falling and being built anew is the same concept as the Great Reset. Empires rise and fall, masses overpopulate then get depopulated, but those at the very top of the tower remain in control of it.</p>

        <p>I just stumbled on to this sub. 
Reading these posts reminds me of how I used to be, and how much I've changed and grown.
I used to be into conspiracy theories BIG time. 
Now I cringe when I think about some of the ridiculous things I used to believe in.
I'm so grateful I'm not stuck in that fearful,paranoid antivaxxer way of thinking.
I thought I was "Woke" ! That I had secret knowledge of what's really going on("look at all those sleepwalking brainwashed sheeple!")
But in reality, I was a scientifically illiterate fool who had never learnt about logical fallacies and cognitive biases.</p>

        <p>On what basis do people like you believe that science is dead though? Like what gets people here to believe that scientists all across the world are not trustworthy anymore? Cause normally one would expect such claims done if the person has their own scientific researches that don't align with those of most researches. </p>
<p>The economy will certainly be hurt by this lockdown and we will have to live through consequences after that, but everything else I am pretty sure will never actually be a problem like described here. I particularly doubt the psyches of all 10 to 25 year olds are now completely destroyed. </p>
<p>I'm sure we will see how most of this will never be the case. Of course there will be problems that have been caused by the lockdown, but not general ones like described here.</p>

        <p>I mean actual science being subsumed by "political" science.</p>
<p>"Global warming" was inherently a political movement, with the stats and narrative massaged to match certain agendas - see "the hockey stick", and "hide the decline". The agendas were very similar to the Great Reset agenda being pushed now via the Fake-Demic.</p>
<p>"Trans" is the demand that actual science and biology be subordinated to "feelz" propagated by vocal pressure groups who are seeking political, legal, and economic advantage for themselves. If I think I am a werewolf, you give me meds and therapy to cure me of my delusions. If I'm biologically a dude, and I think I'm female, you give me surgery and hormone treatments??? WTF?</p>
<p>It's fucking absurd.</p>
