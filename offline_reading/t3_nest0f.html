    <strong>The "End" Is Near! And not just for facemasks...</strong>
    <p><p>Joe Biden will make a "Mission Accomplished" speech by July 4th, if not on that weekend or specific day. He will explain how he and the Democrats saved us from Corona virus. All the Democrat Governors will follow suit.</p>
<p>The science doesn't matter at all. It's a planned end to the plandemic.</p>

<p>The "End" is in quotes because the specter of a "New Variant" will always hang above our heads like damocles sword, and the people who orchestrated the Plandemic will grab that sword and swing it again in 2022...</p>

<p>But for now?! It's time to go out and thank a Democrat! Trust The Narrative. Trust the Science.</p>
<p>It will unfold differently for those of you in other countries, I am sure. But I think the US will be the bellwether and most western nations will fall in line as the US takes this path to "The End".</p>
