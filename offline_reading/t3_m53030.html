    <strong>It is NOT NORMAL to make healthy people sick! Vaccine side effects</strong>
    <p><p>I was on a zoom this week and someone I know got the first dosage of a Covid vaccine, and they have been very ill for 10 days, in bed, extreme fatigue, I don't know all the facts, they are vague but the vaccine made them sick, it started the day or right after they got it. I got irritated hearing someone say, "well maybe they had covid" [I guess that's the cover story for the vaccs, but these were people I know who were isolating so that makes no sense] It was scary for formerly perfectly healthy people to escape extreme illness for these vaccines. I think this person could be in serious trouble now too. Others attested to a few days of having symptoms like an extreme flu. The lack of questioning of the vaccines is really worrying me even when people are saying that it made someone sick or themselves sick.</p>
<p>This was an older but very healthy and active person.</p>
<p>I am getting tired of people being made ill by these vaccines being "normalized". Who knows what is going to happen down the road. I can see a die-off coming and am freaked out.</p></p>

        <p>I have taken tons of vaccines, even TB one several times. I also am on MULTIPLE medications that never made me sick like this vaccine is making people. I have turned down a few for dangerous side effects, my body my life, and I will apply this logic to these crappy vaccines too.</p>

        <p>We've already had a bunch of people get serious reactions from the vaccine at work, leading to lost work. Mostly severe flu-like symptoms, pain, nausea, migraine etc. One employee has been out for weeks due to an immunological reaction and another one had her arm blow up like an inner tube after the first Moderna vaccine, she spent the day after the shot vomiting.</p>

        <p>This is hardly the first vaccine to cause severe flu-like symptoms. The shingles vaccine has been around for a while and has similarly severe side effects. The rabies vaccine commonly causes hives and flu-like symptoms, but it’s your only defense against a disease with a nearly 100% fatality rate. It’s obviously up to you whether or not the side effect profile is a tolerable risk, but don’t pretend that a strong immune response is indicative of some nefarious plot.</p>

        <p>I wasn’t comparing fatality rates. I was mentioning other vaccines with shitty side effects and pointed out that you don’t always have the choice to skip a vaccine because of the side effects (yes, technically you can turn down a rabies vaccine, but it’s a death sentence). You and the other posters in this thread are acting like it’s weird that the COVID vaccine has severe side effects, when it really isn’t that odd. We’re just lucky that most of the viruses with really nasty vaccines aren’t found here.</p>

        <p>Yes! Good post. I know a lot of people who taken the vaccine through my work and just friends, etc. I would say about half of them had negative reactions. Exhaustion, chills, nausea, etc. And when I bring that up the answer is always “Well it’s ok because that means it’s working.”</p>

        <p>yeah that's what I think what the actual fuck, when people are sick with extreme enough illness to be in bed. High fevers too. so we are to take this vaccine to keep from getting sick just like that or less [for most people?]</p>

I am in a very bad position, I want to bring up hey maybe these vaccines are dangerous but I know the indocrination is so strong I may not get anywhere. it's scary to watch people get sick. The person in question was present the day I said, "I do not trust the new mRNA technology" and I remember one person who had some science background saying, "Don't worry they are alright." to the group.

<p>I'm being sarcastic. Everyone I talk to about RNA wants a source to a 100 page paper on it and why its a bad idea to rush into it. It's painfully obvious this "vaccine" is dangerous and people with any sense, intelligence, or survival instinct will not get it.</p>

<p>My guess they'll start dropping dead. Media is start saying "covid 20 because of antivaxxors plz report any and all suspicious behavior." And the weakminded sheep will have either two choices. Blame antivaxxors for the mutation. Accept the fact that they accidentally poisoned themselves and their children and their days are numbered with the fact that they basically have aids. Which do you think most will choose? If you haven't woke up before you get the vaccine you never will.</p>

        <p>I follow that page too, I actually started on Reddit looking for some answers to why I was having the reaction I did, &amp; reading some of the comments on there... well, let’s just say Its easy to see that some lack empathy.... a lot of the “if it’s not happening to me, stop complaining because I’m fine” mentality floats around. It’s so sad, because some, like myself, are 14 days passed their vaccine &amp; still suffering &amp; searching for answers!</p>

        <p>Vaccines are to lessen the severity if you do contract it as well as help with immunity.  Yes some Vaccines do make you immune but not all.  Vaccines are putting dead virus cells in you, so your body reacts the same as a live virus.  Thus why you feel sick because your body is reacting the same.  Saying no Vaccines ever work is such an uneducated opinion you make yourself look foolish.  I think you need to reconsider your opinions.</p>

        <p>"immune response" What a crock of shit.</p>
<p>When the body is doing something like that, it's being made sick. I have severe autoimmune diseases. Vaccines before were not designed to make a person ill. Yes sometimes there were side effects. It's funny most are being made as sick as Covid would make them. [outside of the small silver percentage that would end up in the hospital]  Fear is being used to corral people as willing guinea pigs.</p>

<p>I guess the "useless eaters" don't matter which is why they don't care about unloading an experimental vaccine on vast quantities of the population that doesn't even bring immunity. I am not an antivaxxer. LOL the world's not out to get us, when they totally screwed up our lives?</p>

        <p>booo hooo hooo you can't go to restaurants and movies and masks are big means so now your life is totally ruined boo hooo hooo. Our lives would be less screwed without people like you and the rest of this subreddit. Don't give a fuck about what you do or dont claim to be. Ignorant filth all the same. </p>
<p>Also miss me with your pretend belief that it's "experimental." Especially since there's more than one kind of vaccine out there and other kinds in development. You'd find a way to fear-monger about the vaccine no matter what. But sure, keep pretending you're informed and so woke and such a free thinker.</p>

        <p>Ok mr. know it all, what's my motive to "fear monger" about the vaccine? I wear the masks. I guess you don't care about the people who have lost businesses or who are totally isolated. And you are seriously going to argue it's "not experimental" when it's not FDA approved and they openly say it is in "trials"? Are you kidding me?</p>

        <p>Are you serious?  Goes a year without getting sick, gets the vaccine, gets sick. 'oh they probably just got sick.'  And I'm sure the person in hospice care dying of cancer with hours to live died of covid if they tested positive.  Man, I wanna know how you get there mentally.</p>

        <p>Ahh yes our old friend the Occam's Razor. Lets see what else it slices. Hmm, seems like the mortality is heavily stratified towards people of higher age and with comorbidities, weirdly just like regular mortality. Could it be that vulnerable groups already predisposed to negative outcomes with respiratory diseases are indeed still having bad outcomes while the majority of the rest of society remains largely unaffected? No, that would be too simple. Hmm, seems like lockdowns have not had a quantifiable effect on rates of negative outcomes. Could it be that they are inherently misguided and ineffective, so obviously so that they would have never been considered prior to 2020? No it couldn't be, it must be because bad people aren't complying, although the data shows otherwise. Hmm, seems like mandated improvised face coverings don't have a significant demonstrable effect compared to places without mandates. Could it be that they are inherently unable to check airborne viral transmission due to their obvious design shortcomings and widespread lack of NIOSH approval? No it couldn't be, it must be because bad, dumb people refuse to wear them, despite reported compliance levels of over 90% in places. Arbitrary distancing and hygiene theater requirements (complete with literal strike marks on the floor for the characters marks) haven't made a quantifiable difference? Could it be that none of this has any impact of the aerosol dispersion of an airborne viral threat? No way, its because bad, stupid people are denying it exists. Almost every aspect of this farce wouldn't survive a swipe of Occam's Razor, and that's exactly why it hasn't passed the smell test for almost an entire year now.</p>

        <p>No, I don't think so, but isn't that a convienient excuse. They can tell everyone who gets sick, oh you had covid to cover up any dangers of the vaccine. If they were telling the truth, these are older people who never left their house. They would go outside away from people. They were living more isolated then me from what they said.</p>
