    <strong>Why continue to wear masks?</strong>
    <p><p>I've been reading this sub for a while and a recurring theme here is the belief that everyone will have to continue to wear masks for ever. That this is the new normal even when the pandemic is over. </p>
<p>Why tough? What does the government or big bussiness win by people continuing to wear masks? I genuinely have no idea and I am really curious to hear your thoughts on this as i've haven't yet read an explanation for this.</p></p>

        <p>Masks are a form of subversion to instill fear, you can avoid the news, avoid the internet, avoid the radio but everywhere you go you will see the psyop message that "danger" lurks around every corner</p>
<p>It just ensures you can never get away from the narrative they want to portray</p>

        <p>Seeing people in masks makes me anxious, and I suspect this might be true for many others. Facial expressions are important in societies. We primates rely on them for so much communication and inference. When I am out in public I tend to rely on people's facial expressions to gauge them. When the masking stopped where I live, and I went to the store, and the nice worker smiled at me as I returned my cart to the front of the store, and I smiled at him- I was instantly relaxed, and, because it had been so long since I'd had that kind of simple interaction with a stranger, it felt positively magical. Masks create literal borders between individuals.  The masks make us faceless, a crowd of unknowns, and we all become "others" to each other. It's an awful thing.</p>

<p>https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-administration-recommend-vaccinated-wear-masks-areas-low-vaccination-rates-n1275012</p>
<p>This isn’t just America. Several other Countries also been talking about making wearing masks mandatory again while it’s public knowledge the WHO and CDC admitted regular masks have less then 0.2% effectiveness in preventing spread.</p>
<p>I think (more like; I hope) this is just incompetence and they just don’t know what to do and hope that reminding people of Covid by having masks everywhere will keep people alert.</p>

        <p>From the article:<br>
"While the Covid vaccines have led to a steep decline in new infections, deaths and hospitalizations, multiple studies have found they are less effective against the new delta variant that now accounts for the vast majority of infections in the United States"  </p>
<p>There are no vaccines for the delta variant, even though you will have a very mild sickness  if you've taken the vaccine or contracted covid earlier (not delta variant). In heavily unvaccinated areas the delta variant will spread and multiply and then reach all the vaccinated people, This is there reasoning for wearing masks again even though you are vaccinated, so it just seems like another step towards fighting the pandemic.   </p>
<p>Also this: <br>
"Administration officials still contend that the fully vaccinated represent a very small percentage of transmission, which is primarily occurring among unvaccinated people. Walensky said the decision to call a return to mask use wasn't taken lightly, and that she hopes it will be temporary — until the ranks of the vaccinated increase, and the amount of virus circulating in the community decreases."</p>

        <p>It's not my job to "protect" others, though. I did take the vaccine... yeah, I presumed that it worked the same as the traditional vaccines that I as a vet tech for 3 decades would encourage clients to get for their pets. I also had COVID in December and it was SO mild in my case that I really thought it was just my usual "cedar fever", as it hit me at the same time as the pollen season for junipers and red cedars which are one of my hardest allergies. (Juniper and cedar shoot out VERY, VERY large amounts of pollen, and that happens here from December to about February).  I never would have suspected COVID, until I lost my senses of smell and taste. But I had NO fever, NO other symptoms other than what felt like-- and may well have BEEN-- my allergies. But I got my vaccine in February, when 2 rounds were recommended for everyone, and the jab was still recommended even if you had COVID.  I was in Group 1B, one of the earliest groups, because I have a health issue that they said COULD put you at higher risk of severe illness.</p>
<p>Then came the flip-flop, when they changed to one round for those who had COVID, but that happened after I had already been jabbed twice. Then came the rewards for people who went in after me to get "incentives" and even money in some cases for getting the vaccine. People who got the jabs when I did got NOTHING, just a stupid sticker.</p>
<p>I was duped. I ended up with a second jab that I actually DIDN'T need. But... I can't "call back a bullet", so to speak. I can, however, REFUSE to wear a mask. I CAN refuse to play along with this stupid game. <strong><em>And dammit... I WILL REFUSE.</em></strong></p>

        <p>It is to dehumanize the population, us. If you can’t see someone smile, how will you know they’re happy? You’re supposed to assume everyone is as sad and confused as you are. (Not implying you’re sad and confused, just using that as an example) When you see someone’s facial expression, you know what to say and how to say it. With a mask over everyone’s face, you can’t tell how to speak to someone other than a nod. Masked faces look the same at a funeral or at a grocery store.</p>

        <p>Propaganda- literally keeping "the pandemic" in front of everyone's' face. Because you'd forget it without constant reminder. </p>
<p>Also, dehumanization. As the internet has abundantly proved, (&amp; studies) people are willing to be more aggressive &amp; show less empathy for others if they have anonymity &amp; do not see others. It is the reason in the Army we were trained to "engage targets" (Tangos)  &amp; not consider them as people. </p>
<p>Finally- to make those 'lesser' to suffer. Suffering is the point! Notice the rich &amp; our Rulers can ignore 'mask mandates' as they please. It was no error that last year, while Fauci was badgering for mask mandates &amp; distancing there was a picture of him with his friends, in a cleared out stadium watching baseball without a mask, all sitting together. It is no mistake that repeatedly it is shown 'before' scenes of him &amp; others hanging out together without masks, only to put them on to "go live". The message is "WE are better than YOU!"</p>
<p>The same for Islam requiring women to cover their faces. Suffering &amp; dehumanization is the point.</p>

        <p>Here in Los Angeles, I just went over a month without wearing one at all. Then our idiot health department doctor decided to bring back the "mandate" even <em>after</em> the governor took them all away and reopened the states. Even though it's not a real law, all the restaurants and stores are enforcing it. </p>
<p>It's extremely frustrating and concerning, because our re-opening plan (with the color-coded tiers) was supposed to indicate the path back to the old life. Then all the counties moved to the "green" zone, which had to mean no more mandates. Even our governor understood this. And now the health department--based on one idiot doctor's wishes--thinks it has the authority to bypass this. They even literally said the policy would be "like it was before the 15th of June"...so we move back to the way it was in the tier system, because they said so, but now there are no tiers to indicate when it'll go away, so we're completely at the mercy of their will.</p>
<p>And yes, human life would pretty much be destroyed by permanent masks. So of course that's where they go first when they decide to bring back restrictions. And all the terrified masochistic idiots here are following it eagerly like a cult. People even go out of their way to stop strangers on their way inside and remind them they need a mask. I don't understand why they're so adamant about keeping something that was unknown to them two years ago.</p>
<p>I live next to Orange County, so I go there instead whenever I can. I still never have to wear one there. But the CDC is talking about implementing some sort of federal indoor mandate. So is that what people mean when they say we'll have to wear masks forever? Because some parts of the U.S. hardly do at all now.</p>
