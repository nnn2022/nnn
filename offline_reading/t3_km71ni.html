        <p>South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, all had light restrictions if I remember correctly. Unlike Communist China. Korea's early success was due to fast contract tracing. By the time lockdowns were implemented in North America and Europe and they introduced contact tracing, it was already too late. The virus couldn't be contained any longer.</p>
<p>The death rates are higher now in South Korea and Japan than they used to be (but still very low by the standards of Europe and the USA) because coronaviruses are seasonal. It's flu and cold season in South Korea and Japan. In Seoul the temperature typically ranges from 26-40 F in December. But will South Korea and Japan ever reach the death rates we have seen in Europe and the United States? I highly doubt it. I suspect that North-East Asians have built up considerable T-cell and possibly antibody immunity to prior coronaviruses over the years. Given their proximity to China. So it wouldn't surprise me at all if their death rates remain low.</p>

        <p>I also highly suspect many of these Asian countries have a high level of baseline immunity. It’s kind of like when the European conquistadors brought smallpox to the New World. The Europeans had built up some herd immunity to smallpox and had low levels of deaths due to living with the virus for generations. Bring the same exact bug to Americas where everyone is immune naive, and it’s basically game over. Massive epidemic tons of deaths. Something similar is going on with these Asian countries. I think they have much more exposure to coronaviruses and possibly have some built in genetic advantage as well. The lockdowns, masks, and contract tracing just don’t explain the massive differences we are seeing. </p>
<p>It also helps that most Asian countries aren’t counting asymptomatic cases (because why would you diagnose someone with a disease when they have no symptoms). They aren’t counting “probable covid deaths” either according to the super loose CDC guidance.</p>
