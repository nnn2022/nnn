    <strong>The ASSUMPTION that everyone would go along and get a vaccine (regardless of its safety/effectiveness) is why they aren't working. Not BECAUSE people aren't getting vaccinated. That is the angle people need to be addressing.</strong>
    <p><p>As the title states, a global implementation of a vaccine on a population of people with vastly different beliefs, body types, political views, health conditions etc., with the assumption that every person will sign on, is why it isn't working. For the people in power to try this at a time when we are all so divided(more than ever) is asinine. Yes, I know we can get into whether or not this is intentional and done with malicious intent, but we can address this from a completely neutral point of view that both sides of the argument can agree on. Why would leaders think they can get everyone on board without fault? For a vaccine like this to work you need unanimous support(or vast majority support). Otherwise the virus will not go away and instead mutate in order to survive. This is virology 101 and the people in power and experts know this. The effectiveness of the vax is a completely different topic that people can argue until the end of time over. Effectiveness means nothing if people don't take it.</p>
<p>If we can't agree on political views or even climate change, why on Earth would they think we would agree on this subject? Stop blaming the other side for what they did or didn't do, but instead blame the ones in control for thinking this was the right plan for a divided population! When looked at from  that angle, both sides can find common ground a MAYBE agree on something to move forward with.</p>

<p>What about Africa? <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2021/health/global-covid-vaccinations/">https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2021/health/global-covid-vaccinations/</a></p>
<p>People pretending like everyone has a choice. There are billions of people who don't have access.</p>
<p>What was the plan there?</p>
<p>We're we just going to segregate Africa?</p>
<p>The truth is, at best, they just gave people a bunch of shots that don't work and now they need an excuse.</p>

        <p>Yes, with safeguards in place for vaccine makers and pushers -too.  Insanity.  I was actually thinking about this all day.  How stupid and careless.</p>
