    <strong>The Truth About r/Coronavirus. They are all idiots.</strong>
    <p><p>Common sense is not so common these days huh? You go on there and if you lurk, you would just see their nonsense and it's like WTF? In simplified version, they are bunch of lazy fks who want to live off the government, who had no lives prior to covid, and want to stay home all day and do nothing, and shame others for not wearing a fking mask for a "disease" which has a death rate of less than 1%.</p>
<p>Are these people that crazy and dumb? No matter what degrees they have or whatever, they are lacking simple and basic common sense. Rn their saviour who they worship aka Fauci fk doll, he and his crew are laughing their as*es off because I bet they couldn't believe how easy it will be to fool everyone and make everyone fall for it.</p>
<p>These fks don't want to go back to normal, and they want to stay fking lazy, live off the government and shame us for being logical. Fk them. Never surrender to these fks. I just want to knock them out.</p>
<p>And you doomer lurkers wear 5 masks instead of 2. Make your Fauci happy!</p></p>

        <p>&rt; In simplified version, they are bunch of lazy fks who want to live off the government forever</p>
<p>First, I just want to point out that you have the spelling and grammar knowledge of a small child. You're the last person who should be calling <em>anyone</em> stupid. </p>
<p>Did you know that universal basic income trials in America have shown that people who receive a UBI each month actually work <em>more</em>, not less? Did you know the data shows that the money is overwhelmingly spent on necessities? Did you know unemployment benefits have proven time and again to be one of the strongest tools to improve economic growth? Nah, you didn't know any of that because you're incredibly ignorant and you <em>like</em> being ignorant. </p>
<p>&rt; they had no lives prior to covid</p>
<p>Lol you participate in the MGTOW subs. Imagine being an ugly loser virgin while claiming anyone who wears a mask has no life lolololol. </p>
<p>&rt; and shame others for not wearing a fking mask for a "disease" which has a death rate of less than 1%.</p>
<p>In America alone- 29.3 million infected, 531,000 dead. Many of those who "recovered" are still dealing with potentially permanent side effects. And of course your response will be, "who cares?" because you are pure trash. Do you live within a society or have you isolated yourself like a nomad? Because if you live in a society, you're actively enjoying all the benefits of that society while also actively trying to destroy it. You are the embodiment of entitlement and stupidity. </p>
<p>&rt; They love to be fking miserable in their little hell holes boxed fking lives</p>
<p>Again, we can all see your pathetic comment history. </p>
<p>&rt; No matter what degrees they have or whatever, they are lacking simple and basic common sense and intellect.</p>
<p>Lol I guarantee you're an uneducated loser.</p>
<p>&rt; Rn their saviour who they worship aka Fauci doll, he and his crew are laughing their as*es off, because they couldn't believe how easy it will be to fool everyone, and make everyone fall for it.</p>
<p>Quick question to the rest of the people in this sub- does this guy speak for all of you? Because it's painfully obvious that he's an unhinged crybaby who can barely string a coherent sentence together. Lmao he's on some QAnon-level shit here. </p>
<p>&rt; I just want to knock them out.</p>
<p>Lol I know exactly who you are. If I came up to you and said all this shit to your face, it's a fact you would stand there and take it with a stupid smile. You jump online and hide behind your anonymity while acting tough and talking shit, but in real life, you're too scared to even talk to the opposite sex. </p>
<p>Your entire life centers around how society has rejected you. You're a loser through and through.</p>

<p>Don't tell Me what you do. I frankly don't care. The amount of words you're writing says alot about you lowkey. I'm just flattered by you're very long essay. I didn't read except the first paragraph, but the amount of time you invested. 👏👏 and you also got award! Congratulations.</p>
