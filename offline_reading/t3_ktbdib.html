    <strong>Count the ambulances</strong>
    <p><p>Recently I spent a considerable amount of time with someone that would watch Covid news for probably 8-12 hours a day. The TV would be switched on at 9am, play till 6pm, short break, then one or two hours more in the evening.</p>
<p>Every time an ambulance went past the house they would say 'Another ambulance!'. We lived by a main road. There were probably a dozen or so ambulances going past each day. I've lived by main roads before and this isn't unusual.</p>
<p>My point is that this person was looking for validation that their belief in this pandemic was correct. They had no idea why those ambulances had been called. But every siren that wailed was another small confirmation to their beliefs.</p>
<p>They were living in this perpetual bubble that things will get better, despite the overwhelming evidence that they won't and that probably they are going to get worse. Every small hope would be grasped and held dear. "Vaccine soon!" </p>
<p>I have had an interesting life and experienced abuse in several ways: neglect, control, manipulation, lies, disinterest, broken promises. When people who purport to love you treat you in an abusive way, you become wise to it.</p>
<p>This whole experience is ringing every warning bell I have in my church of trust. I'm not the first person to observe this.</p>
<p>It was scary and upsetting to see that person change from someOne, into someThing that was controlled by Covid, every day changing their thinking so they could align with what Covid wanted and the behaviour and expectations that Covid required.</p>
<p>I've been down this road many times before, sometimes as an innocent victim, sometimes as someone too trusting and niave, sometimes as someone who thought they could change things this time, sometimes as someone tricked, sometimes as someone knowingly walking into things because the allure was just too strong.</p>
<p>Not any more. Everything about this stinks. When is enough abuse, enough?</p></p>

        <p>As you probably know OP, a healthy balance is important in life and especially when it comes to watching the MSM... could this person turn the TV off and go outside for fresh air and sunlight? Vitamin D is pretty important</p>

        <p>They could, but I think they have decided to reside indoors for the foreseeable.  B</p>
<p>This was the first time that I've ever felt that I was choosing a side. They were actively trying to demotivate me and persuade me to give up and give in. It was very sad to see someone, so full of an ideology, that their personality had disappeared. I know what it's like and I feel for them, but I know that only they can break out of it, if they choose to.</p>
<p>I've always in my life tried to see through lies and see through inconsistencies and things that don't make sense, even when I've been blindly living through those things myself.</p>
<p>It's hard to live within a lie, when you know and have acknowledged that it's a lie. It becomes even the more harder when you can't escape from that lie. You have to learn to live with it somehow; ways of coping, strategies. It never becomes easy, but at some point you can manage to cope with the lie by controlling / allowing how much it affects you personally. You can't change it, but you can manage it. It's not easy, but I prefer that to the alternative, which is to accept the lie.</p>

        <p>I live in the UK, and I noticed more sirens a couple of months ago, yet I was seeing these videos of empty hospitals, I'm sure they were doing it like you say to subconsciously confirm that we have a deadly virus.</p>
