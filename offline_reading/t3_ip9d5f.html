<p>I mean there's no way that more people becoming aware of how serious this pandemic is and behaving accordingly can possibly reduce transmission... It must be random correlation.</p>

        <p>Ahh grocery stores: The number one vector for disease transmission.</p>
<p>Meanwhile bars are reopened, private gatherings went from shameful to completely commonplace, 500,000 people congregated in Sturgis, protests broke out in nearly every city, students returned to school, and many workers went back to the office.</p>
<p>But that's all completely negated by mask mandates.  Because grocery stores were what was getting everyone sick to begin with.</p>

        <p>If things don't fit the narrative then just move the goal posts. We'll see as time goes on if deaths see a spike, but so far it isn't the case in most states. It depends a lot on who is getting sick.<br>
I wonder if they'll ever make the distinction between infections and cases. Probable not.</p>

        <p>I don't know if you mean that, but it's the wrong way to look at things. We should be taking care of our elderly and help to ensure their safety. Death is a part of life, but it doesn't mean they have to die early.<br>
We can protect people without lockdowns. However, it would be more difficult with callous thoughts like this. You can feel however you feel, but I think it would be different if you were in their position. You can reject the lockdowns and worry about freedoms being taken away and still have compassion for those who are suffering.</p>

        <p>There is so much wrong with your line of thinking it's hard to know where to begin. If you oppose masks because they are ineffective at preventing disease spread, I understand that completely. But you don't like he way the look and feel, boo hoo. Isn't your life hard? If we are talking about personal rights, I think there is an argument there. That is why there is no federal mandate; they don't have the authority. But it is not for any of the reasons you have in that thick skull of yours.  </p>
<p>You claim that it is deadly and "killing the weak" and you also seem to think that it just doesn't concern you to do anything that would prevent a death, because you are too weak of a person to wear a mask. You also talk about natural selection, but you don't know shit. Humans didn't survive because we are the biggest and baddest animals around. We survive because we are smart and know how to cooperate with each other. Qualities that elude you. There may be good reasons to be against masks, but you are against them for all the wrong reasons. 
To be frank you are just a selfish cunt. You sound like the kind of person who would walk all over someone else's personal freedoms to have your own. Newsflash, your right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness does not give you the authority to take another person's away.  With people like you around, it's no wonder people think we are all a bunch of twats over here.</p>

        <p>So then you agree that to protect others, people should wear masks, in particular around the "Immunocompromised"?</p>
<p>Why the hell are you here, you sound like the liberal shits forcing us to wear them. And just because there isn't a federal mandate it doesn't change that state governors, regardless of retarblican or democrap affiliation are FORCING citizens to wear masks!

        <p>No, I don't think people should wear masks, but not because I don't give a fuck about other people. It's because the public wearing masks causes more problems than it's worth. People don't know how to use them and they aren't meant to be reused. Also, regular 3ply cloth masks don't change your co2 levels in any significant way. How do you think brain surgeons work for hours in them? <br>
Just so we are clear, I'm weary about this whole fucking thing because everyone in power seems to have an agenda these days and guess what, it isn't so that you and I can live a better life. They took something that's a bit more dangerous than usual and used it as a means to spread fear and gain control. I also believe that there is more propaganda than truth these days, from all sides in this shit show of an election year. But all you most people see is red and blue and can't entertain a nuanced opinion to save their life. That's why to them you're either a libtard or a nazi. Fuck anyone who might disagree in the slightest, am I right?</p>

        <p>Then don't wear a mask. I don't care. The only thing I don't like about what your saying is your zero regard for other people's well being. If you didn't believe the virus was deadly I couldn't blame you for thinking the way you do, but you clearly do and just don't care if anyone is hurt. It doesn't have to even be true, but the fact that you think this way is pretty messed up. Also, nothing I said, hurts the cause. The fact is, we are being played and people need to figure that out.</p>

        <p>Exactly. That's because "active cases" is subject to testing availability, reporting and voluntary reporting. </p>
<p>Of you cut testing in half you will definitely see a decrease in "active cases"</p>
<p>Testing should be used to inform people how much they should be quarantining vs. distancing but not policy guidelines because hospitalization and deaths are better metrics.</p>

<p>&rt;The point is that no reputable scientist will say that Texas is anywhere close to reaching herd immunity. </p>
<p>I’m not going to get into an argument about this statement itself because I (sort of) agree with you that Texas isn’t at herd immunity since there are too few cases for Texas to be there. (I say “sort of” because Texas could actually be depending on the amount of undetected corona cases, especially with the estimated % infected for herd immunity to be reached being quite low now.) However, you can be right for the wrong reasons. Your graph shows nothing about Texas not being at herd immunity. In fact, I would actually say it strengthens the main post’s case.</p>

        <p>If you take out the peak day in the deaths graph Texas is barely if at all declining.</p>
<p>My point is that making any kind of policy decision to reopen right now based on that or OPs idiotic assumption will absolutely make our current position look like a low point. </p>
<p>It's basically like watching a stock drop 1% and thinking "wow, I have to sell now before it drops lower" which on turn makes the stock increase. </p>

        <p>You know the adage about trying to time the market?</p>
<p>You seem convinced that everything is declining, but that really isn't something that can be determined right now. If next week we have more deaths dies that mean they are increasing? Because that's happened repeatedly. What if it's 3x higher in a week. </p>
<p>Your blind optimism that things are getting better is what leads policy makers to open up early which has repeatedly set trends back.</p>

        <p>It cannot be determined right now? I can look at graphs with my own eyes and see that it has been declining. I’m not making predictions about the future by doing that. </p>
<p>I never said it will certainly continue declining, although it likely will since there is no reason for the trend to be broken. Your reasoning relies on a false equivalency: equating trends within the stock market to trends of the spread of a virus. (Although actually, I’m not so sure you know much about the stock market, as it’s nearly a guarantee that over a long period of time a properly diversified portfolio will generate a return proportional to the growth of the economy.) </p>
<p>A legitimate argument you could make is that schools reopening will cause a surge in cases and therefore deaths (since that is the only thing that has changed over the past couple of weeks), but you have failed to make that argument. Once again, you can be right for the wrong reasons. Note that I’m not necessarily saying you’re right this time.</p>

<p>I legitimately think you’re a troll now. The way you write makes you seem reasonably educated, but you say a lot of things that really make no sense. If you’re not a troll, perhaps you are well-educated  (maybe you went to a solid high school) yet lack general intelligence. </p>
<p>Also, the first part of your comment raises an important question. What is “the meantime”? Unfortunately, the virus will not go away unless we have a very effective vaccine. So if this “meantime” lasts for an indefinite amount of time, what difference does it make as to when we reopen as long as hospitals stay under capacity? We (as a country) had this discussion in April actually. Wasn’t the whole point of locking down to “flatten the curve” and make sure that hospitals were not over capacity? Why are the goalpoasts changing now? The current lockdowns are clearly a mistake.</p>
