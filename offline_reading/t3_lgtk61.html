    <strong>The power of the mind (the nocebo effect)</strong>
    <p><p>I was not always an skeptic about covid 19. At the beginning of the first quarrentine I was honestly scared, no so much for myself cause I was not in a risk group but I was expecting a lot of people to die. I was desinfecting all the products from the supermarket and using gel for the hands all the time. </p>
<p>As time goes by and nothing actually affected my own life (meaning not only me but all the people I know) yes I heard some cases of friends that allegedly got it at the beginning, they have been diagnosed via conference call (which I found sketchy to say the least) also notice that my friends that allegedly got it they always get the flu.
Then I started learning about PCR "tests", death certificates, empty hospitals and all the nosense of this scam. </p>
<p>The only person I know that has been hospitalised is my aunt, however I wanted to point out that she is the most political person I know, all her Facebook posts are about politics (this is in Argentina, which is arguably the most political place in the world) and ofcourse her political party is pro covid restrictions so she would defend to death what they say, she took all the precautions, stayed at home, practice social distance with husband and sons,  mask and you name it. 
She is a actually kind of amateur swimmer she won many competitions, she don't smoke and pretty super healthy for her age that must be something around 60.</p>
<p>I'm 39 I've been travelling since 19 been in +25 countries , I speak 4 languages know a lot of people around the world.</p>
<p>It caught my attention that the only person I directly know that actually got hospitalised it was a full on Covid believer/doomer, ofcourse during her stay at the hospital she kept doing selfies and Facebook posts explaining the gravity of this disease and the dangers of the deniers who don't take precautions.</p>
<p>Do you have a similar story?</p>
<p>How much does the power of the mind can influence your well-being and even make you sick if you fully/blindly believe in it?</p></p>

        <p>I still haven't met anyone who has officially had it.</p>
<p>I have a covid skeptical friend who has regularly broken the rules for months. He hasn't gotten the virus.</p>

        <p>I am a covid skeptic.  I have broken plenty of rules.  I have not gotten the virus.  </p>
<p>My take is we are currently living under a paradigm of fear created by a loose trifecta (quadfecta?) of: Big Pharma, Government, The Media, (and social media).</p>
<p>All of these institutions have something to gain from these restrictions.  </p>
<p>Big Pharma, it's easy to see how.  They will make hundreds of billions from their vaccines.</p>
<p>The Government has enjoyed their highest approval ratings ever.</p>
<p>The Media needs to keep people watching, and has resorted to extremism.</p>
<p>Social Media has been hijacked by a bunch of mendling activists who engage in cultural Marxism to silence their opponents.</p>
<p>It doesn't need to be a Conspiracy Theory if at every step there are different motivations.</p>
<p>But I think the biggest evil coming out of this, is the way we're being told to view health, and our relationship to other people.</p>
<p>Now, we are no longer able to choose our own health and well-being.</p>
<p>We're being told to view other human beings as potentially dangerous equivalent to terrorists.  At any moment, anyone one of your friends, or even you(!), might suddenly be struck with a super deadly virus, and kill grandma!  Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!!</p>
<p>It's like saying anyone at any time could suddenly turn into a mass murderer.  I suppose technically that's true.  That's also incredibly stupid.</p>
<p>I have lost an enormous amount of love and respect for my friends and colleagues.  I have lost much of my faith in humanity.</p>
<p>Fuck the people who have done this to us.</p>
