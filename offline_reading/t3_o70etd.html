        <p>It’s just dumb I’m so moderate so I might get downvoted here for saying that, but it’s just so pathetic from them I was talking about how I got sick after I got vaccinated, which is true</p>

        <p>Let me just follow up that I am sceptical of the government and think forcing the vaccine upon people is wrong. Furthermore I think the current lockdowns in place are completely pointless given the death rate.</p>

        <p>You know, I recently listened to a podcast in which it was discussed that in earlier times, discussions were meant to provide both parties with arguments to think about. Out of the learning opportunity arose the food for thought that's necessary to exercise critical thinking. The hosts claimed that in today's world, it were more about propagating some kind of objective truth, or narrative, if you will. In such a scenario, everybody who is against said narrative or associates (even in critical discussion) with those who are, poses a danger to the established order (of homogeneity). That would be considered what is an element of danger.
So you coming into this sub of looneys is so dangerous, such a deviant action, that the right recourse for your presence here would be to ban you from contact with those of righteous opinions.</p>
<p>The question is not whether this sub is correct or incorrect in it's assumptions, but rather how high you value academic thinking and freedom of speech. Are those goals, in your opinion to be valued higher than a potential objective truth.
Are you, after some deliberate reflection, really sad not to be able to associate with people of such an authoritarian stance? (You could always create a new reddit account.)</p>
<p>I wouldn't consider this happenstance a loss in my book.</p>
