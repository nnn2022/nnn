    <strong>Convincing People</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone on this sub ever actually convinced someone to give up masking, vaccines, or the covid hysteria before? </p>
<p>I would settle for even a little acceptance. If you have been able to do that how and what was the conversation like? </p>
<p>I have been unable to convince even my close friends, thankfully they are real friends and won't stop talking with me even if we disagree. I just dont think there is a way and would love to here that someone has had success.</p>
<p>Edit: Spelling, probably more than once lol</p></p>
