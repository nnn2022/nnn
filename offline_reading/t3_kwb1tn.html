    <strong>The line for vaccinations is blocking both entrances into my neighborhood</strong>
    <p><p>Pretty fed up. I live in a neighborhood with 2 entrances on perpendicular streets and at the end of one street is the fire station. Well theyre doing covid vaccinations at the fire station as of last week and since then there has been a 2+ mile line wrapping around my neighborhood. </p>
<p>You would think these people had common decency and could mind the gap for the intersection. But no, the first day it was a honk fest at 6am of a bunch of scared sheep cramming to get their vaccine. Sure after a day or so cones were setup, but these idiots in line were still trying to stay bumper to bumper. Not giving 2 shits about residence trying to get in our out of the neighborhood, and in some cases honking and aggressively pulling up, as if theyre so scared someones trying to cut? The other problem is that both streets that the line goes doen are 3 lanes @55 miles an hour limit, so you can imagine the shit show this creates at traffic hours when most people are usually doing 60. </p>
<p>Anyways, on the 3rd day they had police at each neighborhood. i spoke to one about the fastest way i can get thru and while he was quite sympathetic i was still annoyed. Basically if i couldnt get in or out on my own i had to flag down an officer to move traffic for me. Heres the kicker; the cop himself was annoyed because half of the people in line weren't in the correct tier, and would be turned away anyways. What should have been a quite manageable line ended up being a shit show because people can't fucking read, it was just a no fucks mad dash to ma cure!! But I was really joyful when i thought of these people sitting in line for avg. 6 hours just to be told off at the front because they didnt qualify. That was nice. </p>
<p>My strategy thats been working is to just come in hot, lay down the horn, and blast Metallica. People seem to respond well to that, and by that it mean they stay out of the way. I have good insurance and i hope they do too.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah. A local clinic had vaccines in a neighboring city, and the line was humongous. Same for the Covid test sites. I feel like it's gotten worse in the last few weeks.</p>
