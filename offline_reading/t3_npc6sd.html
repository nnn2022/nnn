        <p>Because, despite Newsom earlier telling you "most" of his Covid-related restrictions will end June 15, his Cal/OSHA staff now recommends pressuring virtually all indoor workers to wear masks indefinitely. This is happening in Newsom's administration on his watch!</p>
<p>"California workplace regulators recommend keeping July 31 deadline for easing masking, other COVID rules," Associated Press, May 28, 2021</p>
<p>The masking requirement “will require employers to track vaccination status, stockpile N95 respirators and create policies and procedures for two classes of people: vaccinated and non-vaccinated,” said Helen Cleary, director of the Phylmar Regulatory Roundtable, a coalition of large businesses.</p>
<p>California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board regulations apply in almost every workplace in the state, and its pandemic standards apply to all employees except those working from home or where there is a single employee who does not have contact with other people.</p>
<p>The rules would remain in effect into early next year, even as coronavirus cases plummet after a devastating winter spike and more people are vaccinated. The state’s infection rate remains less than 1% and more than 17 million of the state’s 40 million residents are fully vaccinated, health officials said Friday.</p>
<p>"Significant Updates to Cal/OSH's Emergency Temporary Standards on the Horizon," The National Law Review, May 17, 2021</p>
<p>New Provisions Effective July 31, 2021:
The proposed revisions to the ETS will create new provisions beginning on July 31, 2021, regardless of the ultimate effective date of the revised ETS themselves, including:</p>
<p>Requiring employers to provide respirators to all unvaccinated employees working indoors.</p>
<p>Requiring employers to provide COVID-19 testing on paid time to any unvaccinated employees showing COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>Prior to July 31, 2021, employers will still be required to enforce physical distancing requirements, except for employees wearing properly-fitted respirators and at locations where all employees are either fully vaccinated or require a reasonable accommodation under federal or state law, i.e., for medical or religious reasons. Employers must supply respirators for voluntary use by non-vaccinated employees and test those employees for COVID-19 at least once per week (at no loss of pay to or out-of-pocket cost for the employee).</p>
<p>Also prior to July 31, 2021, employers will be required to evaluate the need for respirators in compliance with 8 CCR 5144, the extensive California regulation governing respiratory protection programs. Employers should familiarize themselves with these requirements as even voluntary respirator use by employees comes with certain specific obligations.</p>
<p>ACTION STEPS</p>
<p>STEP ONE: Since these are recommendations by Cal/OSHA staff to be voted on by the 7-member Occupational Health &amp; Safety Standards Board on Thursday, June 3, please send your opposition messages now:</p>
<p>Governor Newsom (Use his web form and select "Comment" and "Covid-19"). Beginning Tuesday, June 1, you can make a live call at 916-445-2841 from 9am to 5pm to his "constituent services" staff to leave a live, short message.</p>
<p>"You promised us no more restrictions as of June 15. You need to keep, not break, your promise. You need to stop Cal/OSHA's notion of rejecting your June 15 schedule and imposing ongoing mask and distancing restrictions. This is your administration and your promise and it's on your watch. No more restrictions, from you, your administration, or Cal/OSHA."</p>
<p>Occupational Safety &amp; Health Standards Board (Use their web form or leave a message June 1-2)</p>
<p>"(For the seven board members) Please reject the proposal going against Governor Newsom and the CDC by not ending Covid workplace restrictions on June 15. Follow these authorities and end all restrictions June 15."</p>
<p>STEP TWO: Plan now as an employer or employee to resist any new restrictions.</p>
