    <strong>Must be nice.</strong>
    <p><p>To be able to worry just about a virus with an over 99% survival rate. 
To be able to take an indefinite vacation from work and regular life and use covid as an excuse for when you don’t feel like doing something. 
To financially not need the stimulus check. 
To convince yourself everything’s fine and sleep well at night. 
To be retired and have your house and car paid off, knowing you’re “on your way out” of this life anyway. So why does it matter what’s left behind.  </p>
<p>But no the everyday man still works (if he’s lucky to be able to still have a job) and does everything he’s supposed to while inflation begins to crumple the dollar in his pocket. 
Maybe these well-off older folk will finally wake up when it begins affecting their pensions and 401ks. But I’m not so sure anymore. </p>
<p>Want me to wear a mask and get a shot? Then give me your stimulus check.</p></p>

<p>A fifth of US dollars were printed in the last year. They'll feel it...</p>

        <p>It's just going to continue to pump up equities and crush savings. If your money is invested you'll probably be fine. If it is in savings, or you don't have savings and live paycheck to paycheck, you'll be fucked when inflation begins to effect your purchasing power.</p>
