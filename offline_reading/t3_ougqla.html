    <strong>Unpopular opinion but I don't have an ounce of sympathy for any of those people in r/CovidVaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>TL; DR, There you go. The title pretty much says it all. </p>
<p>We tried our best to warn them. We kept warning them for MONTHS. What did we get out of it? Being called names. Being insulted. Being addressed as conspiracy theorists. Receiving death threats and death wishes. Being harassed on daily basis. And so on. </p>
<p>The flaws in the data and researches provided by their beloved "experts" were crystal clear to us. Out of pitty, we tried to warn them but in response, the best they did was coloring us as crazy people and ignoring us. </p>
<p>But look at them now. Hoo boy turns out us far right extremist, Trump boot licking, anti science nazis, straight white incels, somethingist somethingphobics, Fox addicts, Tucker worshipping losers were right all along. </p>
<p>I'm not a very emotional guy and I'm barely moved but right now I'm writing all this with a heavy heart (not crying. Just somewhat sad, laugh at me if you want). I don't know why. Maybe it's out of some sort of relief, maybe it's out of some kind of pitty (that I'm unknowingly  trying to fight off) for covidians, or maybe for all the energy I wasted on convincing them, all to no avail. Maybe it's not even sadness. Maybe I'm actually happy to finally see that I'm proven right (ONCE AGAIN). But I do know one thing. And that is, at this point, after all I, and so many others have been through, after everything that covidians put us through, I no longer have any sort of sympathy for any of them and whatever happens to them they deserve it. </p>
<p>I encourage all and every single one of you to go to the r/CovidVaccinated and take a good and long look at the posts there. Before seeing the post myself I was thinking  "ok, the posts on hot are gonna be like 'I'm so happy with the vax' but if I sort by new I'm going to see people being completely dissapointed in the vaccine" and hoo boy I was wrong. Go to the mentioned sub, don't scroll by "new", ignore the first couple of posts and then boom, you will find yourself in middle of sea of dissatisfied people who are complaining about the side effects of the "vaccine" (if you can call it a vaccine at this point). They're not even trying to hide it anymore. I don't know, maybe they want to but they can't anymore.</p>
<p>To those people I have one message: dear covidians and doomers, you deserved it. You were fucking warned. You were warned in every single way that a human being with a properly functioning brain could've been warned and yet you decided to ignore us. YOU CHOSE THIS. NOT US. YOU. YOU DID IT TO YOUR FUCKING SELVES. I know some of you are going to pin this on us but just forget it. This time you absolutely don't get to play that card. This time you don't get to play the victim game. Whatever you're going through, whatever health problems you're facing rn, whatever health related issues you will have in future, YOU FUCKING DESERVE IT. You chose this. It's high time you morons took responsibility for your actions. 
This is what you asshats get for painting tens of thousands of medical experts who were banned simply because of questioning this "pandemic", as crazy conspiracy theorists. This is what you get for listening to 600 Hollywood celebs you follow on Instagram on the healthcare issue. This is what you get for blindly following a billionaire with no degree or experience in healthcare field. You deserve this. YOU CHOSE THIS. And now for the first time in your whole miserable pathetic lives (that are effectively worse than death), you have to take responsibility for your actions. It's also good to see that for the first time in your lives you're waking the fuck up. Now I know there aren't too many of you lurking in this sub anymore (judging by comments), but just in case if you see this, spread the message to the rest of your covidian friends. </p>
<p>And as for the mods, and other members of r/NoNewNormal, I wanted to say thank you. Thank you for helping me realize I wasn't the crazy one. Thank you for making me feel welcomed. Thank you for standing beside me despite being hundreds of miles away from me. And thank you for reading this. If you didn't, have a good day. </p>
<p>Peace.</p></p>

<p>It's not that you're wrong. Cause you're 100% right.</p>
<p>At the same time, the social pressure applied to coerce people to go and get this shit is <em>immense</em>. Saying "no" means saying "I don't trust the government, I don't trust the news, I don't trust the medical establishment, I trust no one but my own judgement". Which is what we do, and it's the healthy thing to do, but it's not an easy process to get there.</p>

        <p>I had something in my mind as a response to this comment but then you mentioned my response in your own comment. So now I have a question for you instead </p>
<p>&rt;Saying "no" means saying "I don't trust the government, I don't trust the news, I don't trust the medical establishment, I trust no one but my own judgement". Which is what we do, and it's the healthy thing to do, but it's not an easy process to get there.</p>
<p>While I completely agree with you, tell me, which one is harder? Doing what we are doing now or facing the health related issues caused by vaccine? </p>
<p>I scrolled down in that sub for barely 60 seconds and I was genuinely overwhelmed by the amount of people who were dissatisfied with the vaccine </p>
<p>• hey, after receiving the second dose of Pfizer I have a pain in my neck and it's been there for two months now</p>
<p>• after getting vaccined I feel like I'm having a brain fog. I keep forgetting some words and I feel like my brain doesn't work properly. </p>
<p>• I feel like there's something wrong with my periods. Their cycle have changed. </p>
<p>You were completely spot on when you said adapting the mindset that we have is hard. I'll go as far as saying that staying on the path that we are now is even harder. But it's not as hard as dealing with the side effects of the vaccine for months. When you sit and really think of it, you'll notice it's just a truly simple math. </p>
<p>The worst you can get by rejecting the vaccine is losing some of your real life friends and even that, is not as bad as dealing with health related issues for months</p>

<p>Well, we shouldn't make the same mistake branch covidians do, which is assume every single person that gets covid is hospitalized and dies.</p>
<p>Vaccine side effects are a reality, which sure is downplayed by MSM, but it's not that everyone that gets the vaccine dies immediately, or immediately has bad side effects.</p>
<p>Still: </p>
<ul>
<li>Long term effects are not clear, and phase III trials are ongoing. Vaccines have gotten emergency approvals, and are not and cannot be considered safe until long term studies are done</li>
<li>Vaccines do not stop spread. They are not sterilizing vaccines. They protect you and only you. If they do that.</li>
<li>If you're healthy and youngish your risk/benefit ratio is overwhelmingly in favor of you <em>not</em> getting it, <em>even just considering the short term effects for which we have clear statistical data on now</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you listen to the "experts", the media, the government, they're clearly either lying by omission or straight up lying about all the three points above. But it's a lie they repeat over and over again. It is not easy to go out and say "everyone in the world that has authority on this topic is willingly and intentionally lying to me". If data wasn't overwhelmingly in favor of our stance, you would seriously doubt yourself. I know I did, and I still do. It's still unbelievable to me that we're living inside the biggest mindfuck operation ever brought foward by the governments all over the world, but again - data is overwhelming. It doesn't lie. It's either data is fake, or the government is lying. And data comes <em>from the government itself</em>.</p>
<p>&rt; The worst you can get by rejecting the vaccine is losing some of your real life friends and even that, is not as bad as dealing with health related issues for months</p>
<p>Oooh no. Oh no no no. I cannot sit inside a restaurant without a vaccine card starting the 6th of August. I will be banned from air and rail travel starting the end of the month. And this is just the beginning - they're building things that look a fucking lot like prisons all over the world... not sure what to think of that. Time will tell. But no, this is not just about "losing friends". They will make life impossible for us.</p>

<p>I'm not making the same mistake. I'm merely stating my observation in there. Keep in mind that I picked one of the least biased communities to do so. And like I said before, I encourage everyone in this sub to visit that sub as well. </p>
<p>&rt;data is overwhelming </p>
<p>Data is overwhelming because they keep manipulating it. It's overwhelming because they keep censoring experts who have anything to say against the current situation. Data is overwhelming because they keep cherrypicking it. Otherwise we would've won this a long time ago. </p>

        <p>Honestly although I’m on your side regarding this entire cluster fuck of spinning and manipulation…. I still feel that no one deserves to be given an experimental drug, vaccine, or whatever and be lied to!  I get that you’re upset but people are simply overly loyal and yes they need to learn to think for themselves but saying they deserve it?  </p>
<p>That sort of justifies the evil that invoked it does it not?  I’m not here to say they were wrong we were right.  </p>
<p>I’m here to say bro… this shit doesn’t make sense.  Nothing is adding up and I can’t move forward on faith here.  I can’t make myself trust something that doesn’t make sense. I can’t blame them for being ignorant to the evils that could be because at the end of the day…. My mind could also be changed with substantial evidence.  If I see people turning into zombies after someone  coughs on them  and I see Dr.  Fauci give them a magical medicine that shuts the zombie off… well that might change my mind!</p>
<p>As of now… hell no!  I don’t trust that fool with NyQuil!  But I do feel for the people who have been victims on the other side. </p>
<p>I guess I can’t let their attack plan be my attack plan.  That alone will make me a zombie.</p>
<p>I believe in science.  I have had covid-19.  My entire family has had it.  I know hundreds of people that have had it.  I don’t know one person that has died from it.  </p>
<p>I do know one person that mysteriously died after receiving a vaccine.  She was totally healthy.  I also know one person that had horrific side effects for months from the J&amp;J… only to get covid shortly after.  </p>
<p>I’m with you but I’m also with anyone that is thinking for themselves.  Even if they are on the other side.</p>

        <p>&rt;no one deserves to be given an experimental drug, vaccine, or whatever and be lied to</p>
<p>Me too. But just take a fucking look at them and see how willing they were to get it. You can say that they were manipulated into receiving the vax but it's not like people like didn't try to warn them. God knows we did. I personally talked with tens of covidians on this very sub with my previous accounts.</p>
<p>&rt;I’m here to say bro… this shit doesn’t make sense. Nothing is adding up and I can’t move forward on faith here. I can’t make myself trust something that doesn’t make sense</p>
<p>Me too. Difference between you and me is that I can blame covidians for "moving forward on blind faith" but you can't. Maybe I'm being too harsh, maybe I'm being too mean, maybe I'm being a complete jackass but truth be told I really don't regret it. Yes you can rightfully argue and say that what I'm doing is evil but I'm not the one blackmailing and threatening people in getting the covid vaccine, I'm not the one harassing those who don't want the vax, I'm not the one who openly says "hope all of you who don't want the vax, die". It's them. And now it feels like the universe is giving them a taste of their own medicine. </p>
<p>&rt;My mind could also be changed with substantial evidence.</p>
<p>I will gladly get the vaccine if I see solid pieces of evidence that actually supports the vaccine's efficiency. But there really isn't any. However shutting down opposition, censoring the criticism, cherrypicking the data and manipulating it, is not "evidence".</p>
<p>&rt;I believe in science. I have had covid-19. My entire family has had it. I know hundreds of people that have had it. I don’t know one person that has died from it. </p>
<p>Around me (with the exception of my parents) every single person who was strictly following "safety guidelines" ended up getting it (neither of them died fortunately. They're all well now) and on the other hand people like me, who didn't wear masks, weren't vaccined, didn't stay in during lockdowns ended up being just fine. Make of that what you will. </p>
<p>&rt;I’m with you but I’m also with anyone that is thinking for themselves. Even if they are on the other side.</p>
<p>Of all the covidians I've ever encountered with on this sub, only two or three of them were free thinkers. The rest were bunch of doomers with no basic understanding of ANYTHING. Yes I do respect the few covidians who were genuine free thinkers but seriously though, how many of them are out there?</p>

        <p>Whatever it is, it's getting out of hand and it needs to end immediately. And the best thing to do is to reject these new laws and rules. Even if covid is actually as deadly as they claim it is. If that's the case we need to implant the old rule of quarantine, which is quarantining the the sick and the weak and allowing the healthy people to go on with their lives</p>

        <p>I feel pity for them, though I understand feeling like they had it coming. Most people are followers, not leaders. That's just how it is.

        <p>If you divide the people of the world in two categories of leaders and followers, my name is probably somewhere in the "followers" list as well. I don't have any "leader" personality traits. I believe it's not about leaders and followers, it's about critical thinking and lack of it. It's the lack of critical thinking that led them into this mess they have found themselves in</p>

        <p>You shouldn't feel happy about it. Are some of them smug assholes? Yes. But who isn't guilty of being a smug asshole at some point in their life. Cast the first stone and all that jazz. Instead of kicking someone when they are down, you should be the bigger man and show compassion. If someone told me last week "ugh, I can't believe you aren't getting the vaccine you anti-science bigot! My grandma can die because of you!" and this week is like "I took the vaccine and now I have long Covid. This sucks", I would just tell them "I am very sorry to hear about your adverse reaction. I wish you the best and hope you get well soon" and genuinely mean it. Don't let hatred breed more hatred. Don't let them make us the Hatfields and McCoys, fueding for decades until we don't even remember why we are feuding.</p>

<p>CNN tells them to hate and harass you. Fox News tells you to hate and harass them. It seems all media, regardless of party alignmnet and bias, wants you full of hatred and attacking your neighbor. The best way to tell the elites to go fuck themselves is to not play that game. I will not allow my neighbor to become my enemy.</p>

        <p>I will not allow my friends to become my enemies either (not over covid at least). But if my "friends" decide to give me a forced vaccinations then they're no longer my friends. The vast majority of covidians were the same people who were straight up sending death wishes to all of us. Were there any free thinking individuals among them who engaged in civil discussions with us? Of course there were. But even those people have to be held accountable for their actions, just like all of us should be held accountable for out actions (regardless of what our actions might be) </p>
<p>That being said, I hope in future when covidians start regretting their decisions and their attitude towards us, I'll be able to forgive them and provide them the sympathy they need. But come on, admit it, that at least for a short period of time, we should reject them so they'll be forced to finally reflect on their actions and decisions. </p>
<p>It's not about revenge, it's about responsibility and accountability. And those two are very rare virtues among covidians</p>

        <p>Nope. I just don't agree. I get that people hate me and wish me dead. I refuse to hate them back. Obviously I would take steps for immediate self-defense if someone were to get physical with me, but I don't wish anyone ill because they said mean things on the internet and I don't rejoice in their suffering.</p>

        <p>I totally get your frustration, anger and sadness, but I don't think villainizing those people will lead to anything good. Just because they villainized the critical people, doesn't mean they should fire right back at them with the same medicine.</p>
<p>What both sides have in common is fear. The vaccinated people took the vaccine because they feared what the media told them to fear. They feared never being able to go back to normal ever again, they wanted the bs to stop just as much as everyone else.</p>
<p>I want to make it clear that I in no way support the hate-speech you describe and that I've seen. I am just trying to say that I don't think we'll ever be able to come back to any kind of functioning society if both sides keep the hate going. Someone has to let the hate go. And I think it's our job to do so. </p>
<p>Just imagine the cognitive dissonance going through these people's heads... And how much they have to go through mentally before being able to first accept that and admit to themselves they were wrong and then secondly actually taking the time to post it on the internet. Imagine KNOWING that you let someone inject you with this toxic, and you did it willingly, and now you know it is hurting you, and there's absolutely no way to reverse it. I'd be fucking scared. These people are waking up, as you said. These people probably won't be supportive of forcing vaccines on other people because they know what it did to them. Please, don't rub it in their face that they ruined their lives when they seek sympathy and understanding, especially when they admit to being wrong.</p>

        <p>Been reading your comment over and over and over again, trying to come up with a proper response... But I can't think of any... I guess this is the second time that something like this happening to me throughout all of my years on the internet. </p>
<p>Your comment surely has given me a lot to think about. Maybe I'll change my mind for the better in the future, maybe I'll do the opposite. However this comment will linger somewhere in the back of my head for some time, specially the last paragraph. </p>
<p>My guess is that my opinion will change based on the way that covidians will act from now on. If they continue to support forced vaccinations (which I guess they will) I'll definitely be even more harsh on them. But if they do the opposite, I hope I'll be able to give them the comfort they're looking for. </p>
<p>Anyway, you have showed me a new perspective. I truly appreciate that</p>

        <p>I do believe we need to open our hearts to anyone willing to admit they were wrong. No one deserves to be murdered or maimed by the elitist cabal. Sure, I fully support standing our ground against those who screech and defame us, but for those seeking forgiveness? We need to unite. Strength in numbers.</p>

        <p>In a way I agree with you. We all know not every single person who had the vax was an asshat. We know there were few of them who engaged with us in a civil way (and for one wish them the best). Problem is the vast majority of them were asshats. And in order for them to "join" us, they're gonna need some time alone to reflect on their own actions, and maybe build up the courage to interact with us</p>

        <p>Actual quote from that sub:</p>
<p>29/f takes first jab:<br>
"fast forward and the panic attacks <br>
persisted EVERY SINGLE DAY.  I went to countless doctors who told me that is not a possible reaction caused by the vaccine but I refuse to believe I developed a debilitating panic disorder overnight out of <br>
nowhere.  I know myself and my body and I have never experienced anything like this before.  I met with a doctor who finally told me he believed me and I felt like I could cry he said I should think long and hard before getting the second shot. I decided to get it because after all I went through I might as well be fully protected. That was another horrible experience getting the second shot but I did it and all the doctors there could say was you we’re probably just nervous to get the shot, which I was not.I now need to be medicated to deal with life"</p>

        <p>Its not we vs them. I understand if you dont have sympathy  but dont have hate for a whole group. Hate the individuals that say stuff like fire unvaxxed, dont sell to them or put them in ghetos.</p>

        <p>I don't have hate for the whole group. Obviously among them also were a few free thinking individuals who engaged in civil discussions on this very sub with us. I respect them and I wish them well despite our disagreements. Problem is that only a very small group of them were like. The rest were the same assholes who were sending death threats to us. </p>
<p>It's not about hatred and resentment it's about actions and consequences. Now what's happening to them is almost as bad as what they wished upon us. </p>
<p>I hope one day all of them will wake up and fully recover. Having someone from the opposing side join us is better than them dying, because it makes us even more powerful. But for that to happen, covidians are gonna need some time to reflect on their actions and decisions... And maybe some Assholes like me to rub it in their faces</p>

        <p>Yes, the ones who lied to the people and manipulated them into getting this experimental poison are the real enemies of public, I won't deny that. But tell me, didn't we try to fight off this propaganda? Didn't we try to warn them? Didn't we try to help them see through this bullcrap? We did. Matter of fact we did all of that for months. And yet they intentionally ignored us. Now, at least for short period of time, we need to ignore them so they can think about their actions.</p>

        <p>This sub in general might be a small corner of the internet but it's not the only place on the internet (or even in the world) where people were openly criticizing and questioning the events regarding coronavirus. I can think of a long list of people who did the same but covidians just painted them as FaW wAyT IsTiRiMiSt and then ignored them. Yes. It wasn't equal air time. It never was. But it was no air time either. </p>
<p>Besides, it's not like those of us who are part of this community found it because we were guided by some divine being. No. We saw the double standards, we had our doubts and then we started looking for people who had doubts and questions similar to us and from there on, we slowly started building and forming this community.</p>

<p>I don't need to look further than all the generic subs that ban me for participating here to see this is not about a deadly disease.  </p>
<p>If free speech and dominion over your body are removed, we have already fallen.  </p>
<p>2 years is a long time, my sympathy becomes apathy becomes pity becomes resent.</p>
<p>I've made peace with myself about it.  </p>
<p>A proverbial line in the sand.</p>
<p>I am so disappointed by many people I used to respect.</p>
<p>I consider them dangerous now, weak drones who mindlessly comply without reflection.</p>
<p>I would never again let them care for my dog let alone a child.</p>
<p>I'm also not eating any food they prepare for me.</p>
<p>I don't owe them an explanation, but I'm happy to discuss it. </p>
