        <p>I absolutely loathe how this garbage has seeped into every aspect of life. It's all over the advice columns, and the answers and comments almost always support the hysteria narrative. It's like there is no little corner of life where it can be escaped, and I suppose that is intentional. Feels like torture.</p>
<p>I teach college, and my classes are usually designed to be very interactive. Our going back plan for the few classes that will be allowed on camous is social distancing and masks required at all times. I really can't even imagine how messed up that's going to be and how much it is going to take away from everyone's experience. So sad.</p>

<p>It is intentional. It's a psy op. From the start there wasn't a single business that didn't post some kind of covid message on their site, even the ones that are completely online!</p>

        <p>Mods, please change the flair if I picked the incorrect one.</p>
<p>This letter just makes me feel creeped out. I know people that work in healthcare that can still eat out and otherwise live normal lives. Why is this manager so bound and determined to control what his/her employees do when they’re not on the clock?</p>
<p>Also, if you want to read the comments, some of them are suggesting the offended employees need to be “re-educated” and have a visit from a public health worker. Some even condone firing the employees and say things like “the trash takes itself out” about the diners who want to quit.</p>
<p>The OP is in the comments, and from what I can see, doesn’t say where they’re located but does mention that the dinner took place at a restaurant with a patio and is upset that masks weren’t worn. Depending on their location, the employees didn’t even do anything wrong. In PA, we only have to wear masks at restaurants when exiting, entering and using the restroom. They can be removed at your table. </p>
<p>I can’t imagine that we’re now in a world where it’s OK to consider firing someone who went out for dinner with friends, and that employers can control your personal life to this degree. And these idiot comments and Alison (the blogger) are cheering the OP on.</p>

        <p>Oh I definitely agree. What do you expect from the crowd who, if there were no pandemic, would be clutching their pearls because they might have to attend the company picnic and be pleasant with coworkers? </p>
<p>These people further amaze me when Alison does a salary survey, and all these commenters who hate being pleasant at work always make high five or low six figures and see themselves as indispensable superstars.</p>

        <p>To think about how politically biased this is, imagine if the coworkers did something “pro-SJW” outside of work, and the boss was unhappy with that? Ex: attended BLM protest, had gay sex, or attended a Biden event.</p>
