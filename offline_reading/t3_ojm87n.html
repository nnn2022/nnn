        <p>I never thought I’d be grateful getting old, until the world started crumbling hard in 2020. 
I fear for all the young people and what kind of dystopian future you will live through.  Hang in there and stand strong.</p>

        <p>Yeah l used to feel bad about getting older but now l'm not actively trying to avoid death anymore. Finally got a motorcycle this year. Haven't done it until now because l thought it was risky and wanted to be around for more time. Not anymore,don't want to be around for this future.</p>

        <p>Amazing how our thoughts on life change when things go to shit. 
Good for you that you bought a bike. Enjoy it as much as possible or anything else that brings happiness to you. 
I feel exactly the same, I’m not planning on living in this dystopian hell once it fully crashes either. 
I’m terrified for my husband and animals though.</p>

        <p>I want to see is a study about natural immunity as a result of being covid recovered. I want to know what my body has done to develop antibodies to the SARS-COV-2 virus. Are the antibodies that my body is producing focusing on the spike protein or the virus itself? What is my body doing that is so different from the vaccine? I know the vaccine is using the Spike protein but what is my body doing different? What are my antibodies attacking?</p>

        <p>I took this passage from a study done on vaccinated and people who had caught Covid and developed a natural immune response</p>
<p>"There was a difference between the antibodies elicited by natural infection compared to that from the vaccine. Since the vaccine does not have the nucleocapsid protein, there are no antibodies against this in the vaccine-induced antibodies. However, antibodies against nucleocapsid were seen in natural infection, suggesting this could be a biomarkerfor natural infection.Further testing revealed that vaccines elicit more antibodies against the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) compared to the antibodies seen in natural infection. All individuals had antibodies to seasonal flu, and cold and the levels were the same for all irrespective of whether they had COVID-19.Natural infection produces antibodies to the nucleocapsid and all fragments of the spike protein. The highest antibody levels were against the nucleocapsid, full-length spike protein, and the S2 subunit."</p>
<p>As you can see natural immunity cover the whole virus, the study went on to say that the vaccine produced massive amounts of antibodies against the RBD which makes sense as that was the area they were targeting i believe</p>

        <p>One of the possible contributers to the issue vaccinated people are having with the variants is something called "Leaky Vaccines". Essentially according to this paper when you manufacturer anti-disease vaccines vs sterilizing vaccines (destroy's the pathogen associated with the virus) then you allow lethal viruses to live on and mutate into more lethal strains.</p>
<p>&rt;Could some vaccines drive the evolution of more virulent pathogens? Conventional wisdom is that natural selection will remove highly lethal pathogens if host death greatly reduces transmission. Vaccines that keep hosts alive but still allow transmission could thus allow very virulent strains to circulate in a population. Here we show experimentally that immunization of chickens against Marek's disease virus enhances the fitness of more virulent strains, making it possible for hyperpathogenic strains to transmit. Immunity elicited by direct vaccination or by maternal vaccination prolongs host survival but does not prevent infection, viral replication or transmission, thus extending the infectious periods of strains otherwise too lethal to persist. Our data show that anti-disease vaccines that do not prevent transmission can create conditions that promote the emergence of pathogen strains that cause more severe disease in unvaccinated hosts.</p>

        <p>Its scary. We dont understand the body, but the body is smart. When suddenly theres 20 million foreign RNA strands that look like a virus in your body, what would a logical body do? Look for the culprit. No wonder the immune system goes berserk. Its like coming home from work and finding a stranger's shoes in your living room. Youd be paranoid for a year.</p>

        <p>absolutely correct, the "science" estimates there are 30 trillion cells in a human body but they dont really know how many,  we have barely scratched the surface on the complexities or how they and everything else act and react with each other</p>
<p>But it has got us this far managing things quite well on its own so who or what kind of idiot thinks that the answer to a virus, that most of us are already immune to or fully equipped to fight off, is to genetically modify some of those 30 trillion cells to produce a pathogen</p>

        <p>“If there is something in nature you don't understand, odds are it makes sense in a deeper way that is beyond your understanding. So there is a logic to natural things that is much superior to our own. Just as there is a dichotomy in law: 'innocent until proven guilty' as opposed to 'guilty until proven innocent', let me express my rule as follows: what Mother Nature does is rigorous until proven otherwise; what humans and science do is flawed until proven otherwise.”</p>

        <p>Why? 162 epitopes on the actual virus, only 26 on the manufactured spike ...which will lead to a more robust immune response? It’s like comparing vancomycin to penicillin imo.</p>

        <p>This is what Geert Vanden Bossche had predicted. He explained that the vaccines provide a very narrowly focused immunity because it only targets the spike protein. All it takes is a mutation to the spike protein and the vaccine becomes less effective or completely ineffective. </p>
<p>If you catch COVID and recover, then your body has been exposed to the whole virus which gives you much broader immunity. So even if there are some mutations, the virus overall is still similar enough that you can mount a good defense.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's called math. Your chance of infection is 2%, so if natural immunity did not exist at all, your chance of getting infected twice would be 2% squared, or about 0.04%
Its like winning the lottery twice. If natural immunity exists, the infection rate would need to basically be 0</p>
