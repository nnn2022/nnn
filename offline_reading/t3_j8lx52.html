    <strong>Just Got Berated at a Major Airport for Not Wearing Mask (while eating)</strong>
    <p><p>Waiting for my flight at a major international airport and I'm sitting in an empty gate waiting area since I'm early for my flight. I'm sitting about 20 yards or so away and this guy passing by berates me for not wearing a mask. I was fumbling to open a container of fruit I purchased which tbf I couldn't expect him to see, however, the fact he yelled at me across the way presents the modern day problem. I think the gestapo is making a comeback.</p>
<p>EDIT: For those skeptical and feel like reading a novel to fully understand what happened. Also in the comments below for all you skeptics out there. 
"Ok if you really want a play by play here it is. I was trying to spare reddit a novel. I was minding my own business, in an empty gate waiting area about 20 yards radius away from every person. I had just finished eating my breakfast burrito (so mask was off) and I had my earbuds in and was watching my show on Netflix. At the same time I spent a stupid 10 minutes trying to open those airtight fruit containers. Just because I had my earbuds in didn't mean I couldn't hear excessive loud background noises (e.g airport announcements, TV behind me, some bozo who berated me). So I missed his first few words until I saw him waving his hands and looking directly at me. Remember, I'm the only person in an empty gate waiting area so it's not like it could have been anyone else. At this point I removed my earbuds. I heard him clearly shout from 20 yards away "Why aren't you wearing a mask?!?!? This is an airport!!!" All the while he was on one of those moving walking platforms."</p></p>

        <p>If we are going by the narrative, aren’t we supposed to wear a mask only when it’s not possible to physically distance?</p>
<p>So you were sitting by yourself 60 feet (20 yards) away from this idiot, and you need to wear a mask to “protect” him and others... why exactly?</p>
<p>So now not only have the sheep forgotten why we supposedly locked down, but now they forget why they are even wearing the masks. </p>
<p>Ugh.</p>

        <p>Lol I have my earbuds in and I gave him a blank, confused stare because I had no idea what he was going off about. If he just dedicated that much effort into employing himself I'm sure he'd be much happier.</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right. Masks make every single word a person says audible. My bad. I'll just delete this post for your satisfaction. Does that make you feel better? Do a happy dance? Should I give you a juice box and a gold star?</p>

        <p>Low_Oven185 raised a good point since even I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that statement. If you didn't know what he was talking about, how do you know if he was talking about your mask or possibly something else?</p>
