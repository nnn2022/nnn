    <strong>Could someone explain the logic behind this cause to me?</strong>
    <p><p>I’d like to hear why people think the way they do about COVID and masks.  I do not, however, wish to start a feud with anyone here.  Please keep the discussion civil</p></p>

        <p>Im a pharmacist I knew that common public health policy does not include quarantine under any circumstance. As an American, I knew that I have a right to assemble. As a human being, i think i want to see other peoples faces and for them to see mine.</p>

        <p>Masks are not my hill to die on, but the lockdowns are killing people. The “if it saves one life” crowd doesn’t really care about lives. If they did, they would be honest about the impact of the lockdowns. </p>
<p>The news refuses to acknowledge this fact, but worldwide deaths from poverty, despair, missed medical diagnosis will dwarf COVID deaths - if they haven’t already. </p>
<p>Children have been completely lost since schools have closed - I don’t mean lost as in not receiving education, I mean LOST. Lost as in lost track of in the system. Of similar vein, no one wants to acknowledge victims who have been locked in with their abusers, either. </p>
<p>The economic destruction is breathtaking. Small business owners completely sunk, while major corporations reap the benefits of no competition. It’s sick. This will have a chilling effect on entrepreneurship moving forward because why take the risk if the government can shut you down at any time? </p>
<p>These are just a few of many concerns I have...</p>
<p>In regards to masks, I just question the true efficacy. That person wearing a mask next to you in the store likely hasn’t washed it for a week, pulled it out of their back pocket and will touch their face 100x more due to discomfort - and then touch everything in the store.</p>

        <p>I never thought about it that way.  The lockdowns have certainly changed the way we all do things almost entirely for the worse, and it does seem like a last minute emergency plan.</p>

        <p>I have been completely sober of all drugs, alcohol, and pharmaceuticals, for over 5 years. My diet is 100% plant based whole foods, mostly organic, again over 5 years. I take high quality zinc, vitamin C, and other supplements to support my immune system, and have well before this "pandemic." I don't need to wear a fucking mask, or social distance, or stay home, to protect myself from a virus that the government has told me to be afraid, when I'm not even remotely concerned. </p>
<p>Do you understand now? Do you see the irony when a mcdonald's eating, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, soy boy degenerate, tells me to put on a mask? I can go on if you wish.</p>

        <p>Without going into tons of detail, in my experience, people who are pro-lockdown (conciously or unconsciously) value the life of someone impacted by covid more than the life of someone impacted by lockdown- even when the outcome is the same (ie Jon dies of covid, Jane dies of suicide due to mental health issues brought on by isolation induced by lockdowns)</p>
<p>If people <em>truly and unequivocally</em> believe that all lives are equal, then they need to consider the real impacts of both covid AND lockdowns.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people I know are unwilling - NOT unable, <em>UNWILLING</em> - to do this.  If they did, they would understand the point of view of those of is against lockdowns/new normals</p>

        <p>For the record, based on many studies done so far, specifically related to this, suicide rates have not actually deviated from normal with everything going on, some have even gone down slightly.</p>
<p>One example: https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775359</p>
<p>Nothing is completely conclusive at this point, but there is no evidence that actually suggests that there has been any type of significant shift in the number of suicides during this time.</p>
<p>Additionally, based on your "experience", those people probably didn't care much about mental health etc before the pandemic either, so this isn't really a change for anyone. For the most part, anyone who cared about mental health before, still care about it now, those that didn't care about it before still don't care about it now.</p>

        <p>&rt;  Jane dies of suicide due to mental health issues brought on by isolation induced by lockdowns</p>
<p>That certainly seems to be bringing suicide into the conversation, and if suicide rates aren't changing because of covid and lockdowns, then it doesn't fit your narrative that the lockdowns are actually causing an issue with suicide, and you would also be ignoring any suicides prevented by the lockdowns.</p>

<p>Jane dies of [insert treatable medical ailment here] because she was unable to access the healthcare necessary to treat said ailment after losing her job and health insurance.</p>

        <p>There is no point in bringing something up unless you think that covid etc has an effect and changes it's normal course and rate, thus making it worse. If the rate doesn't change, then you can't blame something on it.</p>

        <p>Tell you what. If you can honestly articulate what I think, I will explain to you why I think that. But I'm going to bed that the only thing you will be able to articulate is the straw man that most people in thrall to the media have of us.  I don't think that is malicious on your part, I think that you are simply being told one side of the story by the media, and then also letting the media tell you what everybody who doesn't listen to them "obviously thinks"</p>
<p>Edit:  And to be clear, I am not looking for a gotcha here. I will be more than happy to Explain my position, but I'm not Interested inTrying to talk people pass the same straw man over and over against</p>

        <p>I’m also curious what evidence you’ve seen that masks and lockdowns work. All the evidence I’ve seen shows that countries and states without lockdown measures have faired better or at least equal to those with strict measures. I’ve seen no data after a year that shows me locking down saved lives.</p>

        <p>No Virus Has Ever Been Isolated. Ever. Not this one. Not any.</p>
<p>The virus has never been isolated so how can you test positive for something you can’t identify? No virus has ever been isolated, they cannot fulfil Koch’s postulate. Even Koch's postulates don't hold water. Read the book Vaccine Epidemic.</p>
<p>There is no proof viruses cause disease. We have been blaming the germ in error.</p>
<p>“Contrary to what most people believe, there are no pathogenic viruses. The claims about the existence of viruses and viral diseases are based on historical misinterpretation.” - Dr Stefan Lanka  </p>
<p>A decisive thesis of "Virus Mania" -an excellent read-  is that there is no evidence that the particles that have been given names like HIV, H5N1 or SARS-CoV-2 are disease-causing viruses—and that these particles may very well be of non-viral origin. One central reason for this is that the particles claimed to be viruses have not been purified in the relevant studies. However, such "purification" is an indispensable prerequisite for detecting viruses and creating valid antibody and PCR tests based on them. This is also stated by scientists who are the most renowned in the world.  The list of experts is here: https://www.torstenengelbrecht.com/en/home/  </p>
<p>Every year people are triggered into detox responses that the ignorant blame on a virus, called the flu. The body is brilliant and knows how to get rid of all the poisons people shove into their body's each day. If you eat well and know how to actively remove the poisons, you will never have such symptoms. You don't catch anything! You make it.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I would suggest if you want to read more check out Stefan Lanka's work here. <a href="https://yummy.doctor/blog/misinterpretation-virus-ii-2-by-dr-stefan-lanka-beginning-and-end-of-the-corona-crisis/">https://yummy.doctor/blog/misinterpretation-virus-ii-2-by-dr-stefan-lanka-beginning-and-end-of-the-corona-crisis/</a></p>
