    <strong>My very good friend who was against masks or vaccines just got vaccinated. Voluntarily.</strong>
    <p><p>The weirdest thing is that in private conversations he always admitted corona was a way to suppress the population and kill small businesses, that masks were useless, that the whole world got mad, and there was some hidden agenda in all of that. No one he knew died from the virus, and he had struggled with some health issues because many hospitals wouldn't just take non-corona patients in. He shared all those frustrations frequently on social media. All of a sudden he books an appointment with a vaccination office, and gets himself a shot. Without any pressure from his work. Without even telling anyone. Not even his closest friends. I talk to him a day after that and he sounds like a completely different person. Making zero sense, ignoring my messages, talking some gibberish about how he needed to protect others. What the actual heck? Was his brainwashing finally complete and then something clicked in his brain to go and do something so unlike him? I honestly think I might have lost a friend of 15 years.</p></p>

        <p>He probably wants to "get back to normal" or go to the hospital, and doesn't see any other way. That or he met a woman who is into vaccines and he switched up for her.</p>

        <p>I had a friend do the same thing,  and also lecture me on "doing the right thing", he decided to get it after some reading.  Which is weird the more I read about the farther I want away from it. Anyway he had always been my gun toting and weed smoking buddy. I'm pretty bummed. Can't control other people.</p>

        <p>Honestly, it’s not out of the ordinary. I myself am guilty of masking while working and running into a shop with my uniform/truck because I don’t want to lose my job/be plastered on the internet. Every time I do it I am aware I’m not helping the cause. </p>
<p>My guess is he is feeling pressure from all around he just has been able to speak freely with you (which is a wonderful thing by the way, well done).....I mean that sincerely. Make sure you don’t lambast him and alienate him, because he spoke truth with you and to you. Societal/family/professional pressures are very real, very intense and different for us all. We all have lines in the sand, all of us make decisions we don’t want to (myself included). It doesn’t mean we’ve lost our humanity or changed our thoughts. I know actions speak louder than words but this whole situation is so draining on peoples mind and souls, we are going to have to accept people will do things that may not reflect what they believe. It’s a scary thought but it’s true.</p>

        <p>There are many pediatricians out there who will not see an unvaccinated child. When I was finally ready to give in and get my son the bare minimum vaccines for school, I called several places and they refused to see him to GIVE him vaccines because he didn't have any. It honestly blew my mind that it kept happening and was not a one off. I finally did an internet search for "my city anti vaccine pediatricians" and found a forum of parents discussing that. They named one. I called her. And that's been my kid's Dr ever since. She believes in vaccines for sure, but also believes in personal choice thankfully.</p>

        <p>One of the things I’ve learned since the scamdemic started was how fickle people can be with their beliefs. I’ve seen people go from skeptic to doomer and vice versa since this mess started. </p>
<p>People flip flop and rarely acknowledge it. That’s why we meme that years from now, everyone and their mom is going to say they were against the lockdowns. We can predict this because people find comfort in joining the herd and by then, public opinion will have changed. </p>
<p>If you want to know where someone truly stands on a topic, avoid leading questions that give away your stance. When I ask open-ended questions to people about the new normal, most of them do not seem to have strong opinions for either side. </p>
<p>It’s the NPC conformity mindset + the media that’s keeping us in this hellscape. Im sorry about your friend. Maybe he believed that the vaccine would be the endgame, like that one guy who used to be a mod on here.</p>

        <p>My ex's new wife got both of hers voluntarily. I found it weird because my ex was and still is totally against it. I hope she doesn't brainwash him too. </p>
<p>The weirdest part was talking to her about it. I said to her so NOW you don't have to wear a mask. Of course she said she does and gave me lame reasons why. Then she tells me it's okay because the nurse explained the vaccine has part of dead virus that trains her immune system to fight off the real virus. She's in healthcare BTW. I told her neither Pfizer or Moderna are made from a dead virus like the flu is. I explained they are experimental mRNA vaccines that haven't even been FDA approved. She got Moderna. She was confused a little but still shrugged me off. I also told her the vaccine is only good for three months (per my own healthcare job) and that she'll need boosters for the variants. She was completely clueless. I had no idea she was that damn dumb.</p>

        <p>This wasn't just a Facebook 'friend' was it??? That would be like someone saying "The boyfriend I met through a dating site has been awesome! We were gonna finally meet for the first time but now he wants me to send money because he's a Nigerian prince that needs to pay a wealth transfer tax........"</p>

        <p>Possible explanations from someone (me) who has thought about under what circumstances i would ever take a covid vaccine, even though i am strongly against all covid measures, including these vaccines. This is paranoid stuff from. my. brain from 2 months ago:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Being suicidal, nothing to loose, scared, proving a point to friends and family by being deeply ill after vaccine to show/demotivate them not to take it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During vaccine get contact info of the person that is vaccinating me and install a system that automatically informs them in case i die shortly after,  in order to make them scared/skeptical and feel guilty and stop with this shit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Believing that the vaccines have emergency permission, thus are still in testing phase until 2023,thus 50% of vaccines might be saline placebos. I would take the chances, just to have a clear mind and not have to worry about any doomer news like "required digital vaccine passports for normal life" anymore</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I actually dont take the vaccine at all, but act like i did and spread fake info and photos of me taking the vaccine, subsequently forge my vaccine passport, and everyone will believe i am vaccinated, including close friends who will see themselves as witness, even though they jusy heard of it from social media</p>
</li>

        <p>13 days late for this post, but this is one of the creepiest posts I've read on this sub tbh. The way he seems to have just suddenly fallen for the propaganda was shocking. Hopefully you can still make him see the light, OP.</p>

        <p>I made a small joke two weeks ago, not related to vaccines or anything like that, and he overreacted so much, he called just stopped talking to me whatsoever. A very good friend we shared lots of jokes with for so many years. This is so creepy indeed.</p>
