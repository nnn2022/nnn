        <p>Yup. I was entirely guilty of panic for the first 2 months or so. Scared of doorknobs, scared to see my elderly parents... Pretty hard not to be.</p>
<p>Then the science became clear. It's just a flu that is 2-3 times stronger than the normal flu.</p>
<p>It's not the apocalypse. It never was.</p>

        <p>Yep, that was exactly my path as well. Gloves on at the grocery store, counting days after being out to be sure I hadn't gotten it. It's like everyone stopped tracking the numbers and stopped asking basic questions.</p>

        <p>for me it was about 2 weeks.  I wouldn't say 'panic' but an overabundance of caution.  When I didn't see truckloads of bodies on the evening news or online I realized this dread disease was just like SARS, Legionairres (-5 sp), and every other thing that's come along in my 57 years that was supposed to end the world and kill us all.  A large load of bullshit.</p>

        <p>I was in constant contact with my elderly parents, so I was "panicked". I'll admit it. I figured since it was the entire world being effected, and they were predicting millions dead and anyone young or old would die... And I believed them.</p>
<p>So yeah, about 2 months.</p>

        <p>I'd say in that situation better safe than sorry.  My wife live with my elderly parents at their request so they don't have to think about homes.  I don't mind really.  But ya when I'd get home in the afternoon I'd strip in the garage, bag my clothes, and take them to the laundromat to wash them and go immediately to the shower.  In addition to masking and glasses daily.  But when it became apparent to me how overblown it was we cut that shit out.</p>

        <p>And twice as contagious..Plus you can get over the flu in a week or so. There's a lot of people still suffering long term effects 6 months or a year after recovering from the acute symptoms. It damages your immune system unlike the flu. You might be fine but the person you pass it to might be an asthmatic with allergies who could be hospitalized with it. It has a 0.2% mortality rate but there's more to it than just 'live or die'</p>

        <p>I had it and I recovered in less than a week. Laboratory confirmed antibodies etc. Coronavirus is a cold virus. That's indisputable, pick up a text book and read about the causes of the common cold: you have rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, RSV and parainfluenza.</p>
<p>Flu can damage your immune system too, it can take a while to recover for some people and some people have post viral fatigue, sepsis etc from literally any viral infection. Stop behaving like a crazed lunatic and go read and understand something that is not wrought with emotion. Don't blather on repeating what the news says they are not experts and cherry pick opinions and sound bites to push their own agenda. That's not conspiracy theory either, that's literally how they work, and their agenda can be as simple as more eyes on their broadcast or clicks on their website.<br>
Be careful trusting government officials as all they truly care about is political gain and not looking bad (covering their own ass), now that lockdowns have been a thing they'll try and use them at the drop of a hat to look good. Seriously ask an official if having a virus means you have immunity afterwards or if a vaccine gives lasting immunity and reduces spread and they'll give you a non-answer because they're in cover-my-ass mode.</p>

        <p>That means nothing. I know someone who had it and had no symptoms. I know someone else who got it seven months ago and still isn't right. If anything it just shows that it's not dangerous to young, healthy people..We already know that</p>

        <p>No. We don't do that here. I think that was only China afaik. I got the nose and throat swab...Not "for science" but for the result of the test....I can't quite figure out if it's the drugs you're on or if it's drugs you need to be on. Maybe talking to someone would be a good start. Let your feelings out to someone who gives a fuck about your laughable little opinions</p>

        <p>The fact that you wanted to put "sane" in your username and that it sounds like "know I'm sane" says a lot. You know you're not normal. You know that normal people don't behave like you do. They don't have the paranoid delusions that you do. I can only advise that you talk it out with a professional. Talking to your doctor would be a good starting point. I know this whole situation is wreaking havoc with people's mental health. It wouldn't hurt for you to check in with your doc. They may help you get to a better place mentally.</p>

        <p>Explain how a <strong><em>novel coronavirus</em></strong> is a flu.</p>
<p>Also, while it is true that the common cold is caused by over 200 viruses and most coronaviruses are in the common cold range (though rhinoviruses are the most common), SARS-COV-2 is vastly more contagious and causes a much more severe sickness (COVID-19), not to mention the unknown future health problems including lung damage and cognitive issues.</p>
<p>I would call fevers in the 102-105 range, shortness of breath, chest pain, extreme fatigue, headaches, cognitive impairment, and other problems with the cardiovascular system a lot worse than, "Oh no, my nose is stuffy and I don't feel great."</p>

<p>One of the most known things about SARS-COV-2 is how contagious it is, but I'm fine with citing the obvious.</p>
<p>"While COVID-19 and flu viruses are thought to spread in similar ways, COVID-19 is more contagious among certain populations and age groups than flu. Also, COVID-19 has been observed to have more superspreading events than flu. This means the virus that causes COVID-19 can quickly and easily spread to a lot of people and result in continuous spreading among people as time progresses."</p>

        <p>&rt;when it's objectively not a flu?</p>
<p>You're already wrong because covid-19 symptoms almost 100% overlap with the flu. Even the protein coat is the same.</p>
<p>The fact you need to take a test to find out if you have "it" is strong evidence.</p>
<p>&rt;I would call fevers in the 102-105 range, shortness of breath, chest pain, extreme fatigue, headaches, cognitive impairment, and other problems with the cardiovascular system a lot worse than, "Oh no, my nose is stuffy and I don't feel great."</p>
<p>Except you literally can get those same symptoms you listed above with a regular flu.</p>

        <p>I had most of the above symptoms with regular flu early in 2019. No cardiovascular problems that I'm aware of but then again no one checked. </p>
<p>I suspect that many people think "the flu" is any illness that brings a stuffy nose and sore throat. Ironically those symptoms are much more likely to be a rhinovirus or coronavirus. The flu is a brutal bug that will knock you on your ass for a week and fade out slowly over the weeks that follow. Here's a test: if you wouldn't trade 2 weeks of pay to be healthy again, then you don't have the flu. It's something else.</p>

<p>Now go google what the influenza virus protein coat looks like. Here I'll link a children's biology website: </p>

<p>&rt;I'd rather go through a month of the flu than have COVID ever again. I've never been sicker in my life. </p>

<ul>

<p>Not obese</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not vitamin deficient</p>

</ul>
<p>And it's going to be the same for someone thats immuno-compromised vs the flu, and yet, we don't lock down the country every winter for their sake. </p>
<p>&rt;And you need a test to find out if you have the flu and which one you have. You can also be tested for literally most viruses so I have no idea what point you were making.</p>
<p>The point is, that COVID is so unremarkable that you need to take a test to differentiate the strain that you were arguing was so different.</p>

        <p>Like, "the flu" is used colloquially for not feeling well, but there are many strains of flu and there's a difference between flus A, B, and C. So no, coronavirus isn't a flu; this is just propaganda to make it seem like it's not as severe as it really is.</p>

        <p>Over 530,000 of your fellow Americans (don't know if you're American or not) died of covid DESPITE all the public health precautions instituted by the federal government (under both Trump and Biden) and virtually every state, of course with varying degrees of adherence. Public health officials and others who study and combat infectious diseases as their <em>life's work</em> told us on the onset that if we took these precautions, we won't prevent all deaths, but we will significantly reduce the number of unnecessary deaths of our fellow citizens and most importantly, we won't overwhelm our hospital systems which would further increase the number of unnecessary deaths associated with the impact of this virus. They also anticipated that if we collectively take these precautions, and the death count is (thankfully) less than the projected death counts at the beginning of the pandemic if we took no mitigation efforts at all (projected around 2.2mil deaths in the US), that people will interpret those lower death count numbers to mean that the virus/pandemic isn't/wasn't actually that serious to begin with, overblown, overreaction, etc.</p>
<p>You said "It's not the apocalypse. It never was." I don't recall a single respected scientist saying that this could be an apocalypse (I'm sure you're using hyperbole, but people with beliefs similar to yours love to construct and argue against these straw man positions), but know of many scientist who warned of just how bad things could get if we did not take this seriously. Sorry to hear that your interpretation of taking it seriously was to panic for the first 2 months and be fearful of things like door knobs-- especially when there was a lot unknown about the virus, I don't think that was necessarily an unreasonable reaction to have back then. Hopefully now you know it's as simple as all of us doing our parts to protect ourselves and our fellow Americans by wearing a mask when you're in situations where you'd be in close contact with people outside of your household, hand washing, and limiting unnecessary travel and social gatherings until things are better under control. But more simply, just wear a mask when in close contact around others outside of your household (minor digression). </p>
<p>All this being said, do you still believe that all of this was an overreaction to something that is "just a flu that is 2-3 times stronger than the normal flu," or do you think it's possible that the Trump administration (at least initially) and the Biden administration were right to take this seriously? Separately, do you know anyone personally who died of COVID and if not (that's great, genuinely happy you don't), do you think your perception of the seriousness of the virus would be different if it directly medically impacted you or someone you know in a significant way?</p>

        <p>Thanks for taking the time to respond. So is it your position that the covid death totals from the CDC aren’t to be trusted? Also that we can’t trust hospitals and physicians (who actually determine cause of death) to determine accurate cause of death, because of profit incentives? Can you point to a source you trust that lists the accurate death total, unless you happen to believe that covid deaths aren’t really real somehow?</p>

        <p>Unfortunately no there isn't a civilian based system to determine that the hospitals are being honest with there reporting and most of these cases are historically broken by whistle blowers. Did I also mention over 5,000 deaths in NY were contributed to covid without a test. To make the situation worst even with the tests we have they are known to have a hit and miss success with Elon stating 2 of his four being positive and 2 being negative. Overall what I could find threw 8-16 percent of cases in doubt if you use NY as a example for the nation possibly more if false positives were added to the death count with preexisting conditions like cancer and heart disease which typically top the charts for cause of death in the US.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your well thought out response, gives me insight into how people who share your beliefs (not ascribing a positive or negative value to those beliefs) are perceiving a different reality than people who don’t share the same belief and skepticism. One thing I will say is concerning to me is how both groups (with those trusting science and medicine being the dominant of the two), can perceive the same things with drastically different conclusions. It’s like we’re living in different planes of reality especially when we cannot agree upon basic facts like is the CDC/hospitals/doctors lying to us about the COVID death count. COVID is one example of many of how our fellow countrymen can’t even agree on fundamental truths about our shared realities, and is sowing deep and I fear irreconcilable differences that may not be tenable in the long run for our country. From a birds eye view, are you seeing the same troubling phenomenon occurring in our society? Again I appreciate your respectful dialogue, I hope others reading on this subreddit can appreciate a civil discourse too.</p>

        <p>I don’t forgive the initial panic. That’s how we got here and it was already wrong then. Lockdowns weren’t even an option in any pandemic planning scenario prior to 2020 and they were planning for viruses far worse and more novel than this. The whole reason for planning ahead is to not panic and do what we did over the last year. Now we’ve rewritten society and thrown all our freedom down the drain over this. Throwing away core values during a crisis is never acceptable and that’s the whole point of why our constitution exists.</p>

        <p>I have mixed feelings, I have some family members who have died after getting covid, but they also had other problems like cancer etc. I'm not scared for myself or the people I currently live with, if anything I'm getting to the point where I've had enough and couldn't t care less, the only thing keeping me following some of rules is that one of immediate family is now a carer for a very ill grand parent so I still don't want to bring covid home as I don't think my grandparent would survive. I still believe in covid, I know its real, but fuck, the govt in every country is really using it to gain more power over the people and I'm stuck in limbo of wanting to say fuck the system but also not wanting to potentially lose another family member. I don't understand how I can still go to work as an 'essential worker' throughout this pandemic, yet I can't see more than a few friends outside or tavel more than X miles for exercise. I feel like I've seen it go from protecting the vulnerable, to politicians doing everything they can to protect and increase the power they hold.</p>
