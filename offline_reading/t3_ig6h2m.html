    <strong>San Francisco International Airport opens first airport COVID-19 rapid testing site in the US</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://archive.is/oFFga">https://archive.is/oFFga</a></p>
<p>"The first airport COVID-19 rapid testing site in the United States has opened in San Francisco International to screen employees and airline flight crews, but not travelers — at least not yet."</p>
<p>Said one Very Important Doomer in the comments: "I use to be a frequent flyer but I am not flying until I know everyone on the plane is negative for Covid. So instead of losing billions of dollars, maybe airlines and hotels should invest in rapid tests for all flyers. But I would still want the mask rule in effect. I am exactly the type of first class flyer airlines want, and they won't get me until its [sic] safe."</p></p>

<p>Do they?  </p>
<p>Do they really?  </p>
<p>Do they want just one pain in the ass who wants everything just because they want money who can fly a limited period of time, or do they want a thousand people buying tickets with much lower standards every day?</p>
<p>People with money who flex like that seem to not know how business actually works.</p>

        <p>My point exactly.  </p>
<p>Why would you want one customer who spends money regularly but not every day, versus thousands who may travel less frequently and spend less but there are tons more of them such that you see profits every day?</p>
<p>Either this person doesn't exist, inherited a lot of money and doesn't know how business works, or is the quintessential proof of the Dilbert Principle.</p>

        <p>I swore off flying a few years ago until we get planet earth settled. The 737 scandal was the final kick in the ass but even before then I only flew once every few years or so.</p>
<p>The body scanners were my initial deterrent, but after a couple times of pat-down groping I was done flying. I would rather quit work and take weeks to get where I'm going. There is no better way to see america than from on the ground anyways.</p>

        <p>The economy is booming.  Why would anyone want to go back to the old normal.  I’ve lost everything and am just flabbergasted that the economy is great and everyone is rich and happy.  No change is needed.  Buy a new house, boat, vacation house, and car.  Who cares about lockdowns.</p>
