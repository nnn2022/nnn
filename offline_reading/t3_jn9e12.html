    <strong>A message to the American People from the President (A fantasy speech that may not happen)</strong>
    <p><p>An fantasy opinion piece based on the article "The Case for Lockdown Reparations"</p>
<hr>
<p>My follow Americans, On March 17th 2020 this country was at the beginning of the throes of a flu pandemic called SARS-CoV-2 also known as COVID-19. I proposed to all state governments that they give 15 days to slow the spread. Instead they exploited the pandemic to lockdown much longer than that and then prolonged their lockdowns with phased openings, and unconstitutional vaccine mandates, and created mass testing programs that prolonged the pandemic into a casedemic spreading fear, doubt, and uncertainty into the socio-economic frabic of our country.</p>
<p>In reality after June 1st the virus has subsided and further data revealed that the virus mostly affects the elderly, the already sick, and those with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and obesity. </p>
<p>State and local governments knew about this and ignored it for ulterior political ends by following the guidance of public health officials at the federal and state level that have affected your civil rights, your constitutional rights and have irreparably destroyed livelihoods and futures in a act of government overreach.</p>
<p>This is also amplified by a unprecedented media propaganda campaign to induce fear and hysteria into the populace.</p>
<p>This damage has been further caused by the recent protests against police brutality, which almost everyone one of them have devolved or co-opted into looting and rioting. Which the coastal state governments of the east and west coasts, with the exception of Florida, enabled the looting and rioting under peaceful protesting. This has resulted in property damage, assults, road blockading, and in cases murder. Your local and state governments knew and were willfully derelict in their duty to protect you and your property from domestic violence.</p>
<p>For this on behalf of the US Federal Government I’m sorry. I am sory that your state governments failed you. No amount of words I would say to you with platitcate your loss. As many people have lost not only their livelihoods but all means to bounce back from this as many small businesses have lost their means of living and in some cases their means of living have been burnt or looted with impunity. In some areas, local governments have willfully released offenders who committed violent crimes against the person and property during these protests, they get sent to jail, only to be released again and brazen enough to do it again.</p>
<p>What we can do and which we are doing immediately is to start rebuilding your lives, our lives.</p>
<p>And the first step is force, by all means legally necessary, all states to reopen their economies and businesses immediately. I’ve instructed the justice department to sue all states that are still in lockdown under the civil rights act 1964 and the constitution under the 1st and 5th amendments, and still imposing mask mandates that are affecting those with medical issues and disabled. In addition, I’ve directed the justice department to explore criminal and civil penalities against the mass media companies and social media for fearmongering the American public regarding the coviid19 pandemic and inciting state governments to implement unconstitutional lockdowns</p>
<p>Our second step is to immediately proceed with indictments of the coastal states, especially for New York and California for civil rights violations, Americans with disability act violations, and for mass manslaughter charges for willfully forcing nursing homes to accept covid positive patients. The Justice Department will be applying for those arrest warrants as we speak and will be executed by the US Marshalls as soon as it’s finalized.</p>
<p>The third step is to implement reparations for individuals and small businesses adversely damaged and harmed by these lockdowns. Our current package that we will send to Congress will be as follows:</p>
<p>Every individual in the US that has a income of $100,000 or less per year will receive 24,000 dollars. With past due rent, mortgage, ultities, and taxes forgiven. If you receive disability benefits under Social Security or the VA we will give you another 24,000 dollars in a lump sum and 300 dollars extra per month in benefits for 5 years. If anyone in your family dies of covid or from complications of covid19 we will give you another 24000 dollars If your elderly loved one dies directly because of the lockdowns we will give you 30,000 dollars. This money will be more than enough to start a business, or to be able to move to a different area or state that has a higher quality of life, or travel outside of your state for a given period of time.The money is yours to use and use alone. </p>
<p>For small businesses and sole peripteries, we will give you up to 50% of lost revenue based on 2019 revenue, with past due rent, mortage, ultities forgiven. Or if you wish to retire completely (which we will not blame you for doing so since some of business owners are old and can not start over) we will give you full compensation for what your business was worth in 2019, with you given first right to refusal to any business that wants to take over your storefront.</p>
<p>As for owners of homes and apartments and business properties: We will forgive your past due mortgage and ultities</p>
<p>For people who are at risk of being homeless or are homeless and stable mind and affected by drug addition: We will provide immediate assistance via section 8 or section 811 properties and housing so you will not fear being homeless for the upcoming holidays.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each commercial and residential property that is owned by proposed agency will not be sold or rented to a overseas person. It has to be sold to an American, by an American.</p>
<p>Conventions and large events, especially for Arts and Culture, and fandoms for entertainment cultural properties: especially Japanese anime, western animation, books, media, video games, comics , fantasy that have canceled entirely or forced into a virtual format, will be given up to 50% of lost revenue and direct assistance to add an extra day, extended hours, or compensatory in-person events to make up for lost time. Priority will be made to small non-profits, then medium non-profits, and finally large non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>Large events and concerts that are forced to cancel on 2020 for any reason during the lockdowns and forced to cancel until 2021 or 2022 or completely will be given up to 50% of lost revenue with assistance to schedule or reinstate concerts that are canceled until 2022 for 2021 with additional hours and events. The funding will go directly to the artist, or the performance was done with a virtual character will be given to those who operate the virtual character which is a person or company.</p>
<p>Traditional Arts and Culture and Historical museums and theatrical places will be given up to 50% of lost revenue and direct assistance to add dawn to late night hours for five years. Priority will be made to small non-profits, then medium non-profits, and finally large non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>If you purchased a ticket to these events and you have proof of purchase, you do not have to buy another ticket. It’s free and we agency will pay for the cost of the ticket to given by the organization or artist.</p>
<p>For people who have been unable to attend their medical appointments for any reason and can not afford one, with medical conditions have gone worse. For those who have been adversely affected physically and mentally by these lockdowns we are prepared to offer 5 years of Medicaid and Medicare for every American, and if the person is under 18, we will be give to support until the age of 18 and until the age of 25.</p>
<p>Cities and towns will be provided funding to expand community centers, libraries, and meeting areas from dawn to 11pm for at least 5 years. Said funding will be sent straight to the library, meeting area, and community center organization.</p>
<p>Public Transit agencies will be given funding to allow restoration of hours or expansion of hours, whatever if it’s dawn to midnight to 24 hour service, for five years.</p>
<p>For displaced workers, especially in the hospitality, large-events, travel, or for any industry, we will provide direct funding for community colleges and trade schools (non-profit) for two years worth of in person training. If community colleges wishes to do virtural training, they must provide a in person option.</p>
<p>For public schools proms, parties, graduations: We will give you a proper one, not a dystopian virtrual susbsuite. Because funding will be directly provided for every county and city distrct to have a proper event for the class of 2020 and class of 2021.</p>
<p>For cinemas solely owned, or independently owned, and threaters solely owned or held by a organization we will give you 50% of lost income based on data on 2019, and we will give you assistance in providing individual rights to movies outside of the United States and independent movie creators and production companies in the United States.</p>
<p>For students for public schools forced to hire tutors or sent to private school, you will be can be reimbursed up to 50% for private schools and given funded or subsidized for tutoring services for all age grades.</p>
<p>If you went to a public college or university which the majority of classes are virtual, you will be compensated 50% of tuition.</p>
<p>IF you have federal student loans and are under $100000 of yearly income. it will all be forgiven, effective immediately.</p>
<p>If you did traveled out of state. We will refund you 50% of hotel, airfare, and transit costs.</p>
<p>For law enforcement: We will fill in any gaps that have been cut by state and local governments in the aftermath of the police brutality riots. Which have been exploited to end certain organizations and programs such as the NYC anti-crime unit, and Seattle’s Homeless Navigation program.</p>
<p>If you are forced to move to a different county or plans to move to a different state due to deteriorating quality of life due to the lockdowns, we will refund you 50% of moving, housing, and transit costs.</p>
<p>How will this recovery program be funded?</p>
<p>These reparations will be funded by a sur tax of 30% revenue from 2020 from every company that profited from the lockdowns since march 2020: including Google, Amazon, twitch TV, zoom, medical corporations, Walmart, target, any big tech or big corp that profited massively from the lockdowns will be subjected to this surtax.</p>
<p>Those businesses that have work at home employees with a income over 125000 dollar a year, they will be subjected to a 30% solidarity tax for 5 years.</p>
<p>Second, our plan is to seize state employee pension plans from every state that prolonged their lockdowns. Many of these states imposed unconstitutional vaccine mandates as a way to demand a bailout in lieu of vaccine in further destroy your quality of life and decimate the concert, convention, and large event industry without due process. If people want to receive a vaccine outside of those who need one, that is their choice, it should not be forced onto the populace. And this vaccine will be free of charge to every American, permanent resident, or legal resident that chooses to receive it.</p>
<p>Furthermore we viewed these prolonged lockdowns as a scheme to funnel any bailout money into state employee pension plans, while your taxes are raised and reduce service to avoid being held responsible for socio-economic damage caused because of the lockdown</p>
<p>Finally, we will impose a 25% tariff on all large companies and corporations that manufacture goods in China using mainland Chinese companies to manufacture goods in China or large companies and corporations selling goods directly to the United States . This tariff will be phased in by 12 months until the percentage reaches 25 percent on January 2022. This tariff will not apply to small businesses and small properoters who have no real option but to rely on Chinese mainland companies for their livelihoods.</p>
<p>In addition this package will wave sovereign immunity for all torts and harms caused by these lockdowns from March 1st 2020 to November 3rd 2020. This will allow individuals, groups, and organizations or private indivudals on their groups and organizations behalf, or legal firms on their behalf to legally sue state and local governments for financial compensation. This include perusing the state governors, executive department officers, and legislators personal assets and pension fund. If these governments get bankrupt, any financial reconstruction assistance including bailouts from the federal government will be under the condition that all elected state officials in the executive and legislative branch resign and new officials be elected into office and the state officials that resigned will never be eligible public office again.</p>
<p>None of the money from this package will go towards local and state governments directly which will attempt to funnel money into unfunded pension obligations</p>
<p>This proposal will be entitled The Pandemic, Unconsitutional Lockdowns, and Civil Unrest Reparations and Reconstrucftion Act of 2020, also known the Reparations and Reconstruction Act 2020</p>
<p>Soon after this bill is passed there will be a Reparations and Reconstruction Agency which individuals and small businesses, and organizations can register for benefits and assistance. </p>
<p>This website will be under www dot RRA dot gov us.</p>
<p>The US Federal government will ensure that all state and local governments involved in this self-inflicted crisis will be held fully responsible. We will make sure that state governors directly involved will be tried in Federal court, be sentenced, and be sent to prison. We will ensure that you will be able to enjoy life in our country and be able to build a new life in our country. These lockdowns were a mistake and should never have been done. </p>
<p>With this passage of this bill, we will hopefully close this sad chapter of our country as we begin to celebrate the Thanksgiving Holiday, and the Christmas and Jewish, and Muslim Holidays, and begin to celebrate a new year, and a new chapter for our country and to celebrate our constitutional freedoms and liberties that have been denied by your state governors in the guise of public health. </p>
<p>God Bless You, and God Bless the United States of America.</p></p>

<p>There's a huge constitutional impediment to that idea. Amendment XI states that the federal courts cannot hear any case in which a state is sued by citizens or subjects of any other state or foreign state. That amendment has also been interpreted to mean that state courts do not have to hear certain suits against the state.</p>

        <p>I think prosecuting the media for scaremongering sets a very dangerous precedent. As much of a problem as the media are, I do not want to pull the pin on that grenade. If we prosecute the media for publications we don't like today, that same power could be used against media favorable to you or me in the future.</p>

        <p>The problem is that the media will do it again, they know they can profit from this scaremongering and won't face any consequences because they know people will buy their product.</p>

        <p>Funny how a guy always claiming to be broke and on the verge of homelessness and suicide, could afford a trip to South Dakota. Too bad there were no anime conventions there for you to attend.</p>
<p>Good luck getting these pity handouts to last you the rest of your life Mr. Okeh.</p>
