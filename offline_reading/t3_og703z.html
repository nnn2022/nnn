        <p>I always say it... I feel ashamed of my generation, and I feel bad for the next ones. I can only imagine all the subliminal stuff they’re being subjected to in the background too, that as adults we don’t really perceive anymore. They don’t see an exit to all this. They see the soulless, faceless masses and that’s all they know now. Scary world for a kid.</p>

        <p>Sadly, it's all because this generation accepted this garbage as normal and projects their constant desire for affirmation and attention on to their children. There is no reason a 30 something mother of 2 or 3 kids, girls especially, needs to be posting filtered photos of herself constantly to social media and plastering their children's photos all over social media. </p>
<p>We have a generation where these children's parents determine their own self worth from likes, comments, and followers. It's disgusting and toxic.</p>

        <p>It's sad, but there's a few people out there fighting the good fight. Hopefully we raise a few children with the power to change things for the better. </p>
<p>Either that or they'll be hermits in the mountains somewhere.  Lol.</p>

        <p>Lol I’d gladly become a hermit at this point. I think the children being brought up right now will be the kids that set city halls and cop stations and schools on fire. They’ll see who's making the rules, who's enforcing them, and who's torturing them. God knows what they’ll turn into soon. But for sure they won’t be socialized nicely.</p>

        <p>This is true. A few years ago, I gave up my career and we moved to the country. No internet. No cable. Good old fashioned homesteading. </p>
<p>The biggest shock to me was seeing the freaking 10 year Olds out here given their own cell phones and left to the internet to be raised. Nowhere is really safe, but I'll say we're much happier here than we ever were in the "fancy" cities we lived in.</p>
<p>Maybe a generation that isn't socialized nicely will be the change we need to start rebuilding. Or maybe my coffee made me experience a short period of optimism.</p>

        <p>I’m also in the countryside and never intend to move inside the city again, it’s too depressing. </p>
<p>We are in dire need of a generation bold enough to light the fires that will free our species.</p>

<p>The common theme in the cases in this article is social media and unrestricted access to cell phones and internet searching for minor children. </p>
<p>Bottom line is parents need to stop being lazy and taking the easy way - put your foot down early, lead by example and forbid your children to have their brain poisoned on FB.</p>
<p>The one mother talks about how she explained to her child how it was her fault the algorithm showed her stuff about sad kids because those are the posts she kept "liking." No. We don't explain the algorithm, we take away the damn access to social media. Oy.</p>
