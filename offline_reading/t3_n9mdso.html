    <strong>I live with someone who got both Moderna shots, how screwed am I?</strong>
    <p><p>My brother just got his second dose of the Moderna "vaccine" today, despite my attempts to convince him not to. So far he has no side effects. But I've been hearing a lot about vaccine shedding lately, where vaccinated people are making unvaccinated people sick. I live with my brother, and I can't afford to move out right now. I've been trying to find what information I can about this, so I'm wondering if anyone here has anything they could share regarding vaccine shedding, especially in reference to the Moderna shot. I don't know if the stories I've heard are real or not. I hope I'm just being overly paranoid, but I'm concerned. I've also heard people's pets are dying, and I have two cats. If the vaccine shedding is true, then how much contact does it take to make me sick? I can avoid him for the most part since it's a split-level house, but does that even make a difference?</p>
<p>Any information would be appreciated.</p></p>

        <p>I think the shedding thing, while there may be validity to it, is being hyped up to form yet another division between all of us. I definitely can't look at my dad the same after he got his first shot after me saying a million times they are experimental etc... but I think the shedding is to get us to view them as dangerous the same way the irrational view us without masks as dangerous. I think we need more evidence than the menstrual cycle stories and other anecdotes from the web.</p>

        <p>Totally agree. </p>
<p>But, then again we may be wrong. This thing is 100% untested IN THE LONG TERM. Guess we will all wait and see. I hope I am wrong. I hope they can all point and say they told me so. But, I am too leery to give in.</p>

        <p>I never ever get sick beyond a mild cold for a few days. Never get the flu. Had covid last fall with mild symptoms.</p>
<p>My wife got the moderna shot a few weeks ago and within one week she had severe “sickest I’ve ever been in 7 years” symptomatic covid plus a full body rash.</p>
<p>Within a few days of her becoming terribly ill I started to experience a lot of the effects people mention in the covid vaccinated sub.</p>
<p>High unexplainable heart rate for days and constant mild fever lasting weeks. Eye twitching. Constant sore throat.</p>
<p>I literally never get sick beyond a cold and I had covid last year and the past few weeks I’ve experienced the symptoms of being vaccinated despite not taking the vaccine myself yet working at home with my wife and sleeping in the same bed.</p>
<p>Once you understand that the spike protein itself is highly toxic and responsible for most of the severe symptoms of covid it makes sense that being nearby someone whose body is creating literal trillions of spikes could cause problems even if you didn’t take the vaccine yourself.</p>
<p>I used to think it was a psyop for divide and conquer purposes too until I saw and experienced all of this firsthand.</p>

<p>It took a week or two after her vaccine for me to notice symptoms. Pay attention to how much time has passed and see if you start to feel sick after one and a half to two weeks.</p>

        <p>I think you are right to be concerned. The reports of unvaccinated women having bad menstrual symptoms after just being around vaccinated is too high to ignore. I have no advice but only to go with your gut that this is a problem. Don’t listen to the nay sayers.</p>

        <p>Nobody knows yet (except maybe the globalists).</p>
<p>If the shedding was true, would they still be pushing the vaccines so hard or wouldn't they need to because it would spread from itself?</p>
<p>Then again, maybe they haven't vaccinated enough people yet for the shedding to be effective...</p>
<p>If shedding is real, then you can't leave your house anymore (in your case enter your house... ;) ), because anybody you would encounter could be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Best advice: Don't live in fear and trust your SELF.</p>

        <p>You have no idea what is in those shots or what sort of genetic modification has occurred.</p>
<p>Even if germ theory is all bullshit, terrain theory relies on blaming toxins for all illness (which I mostly agree with) but that doesn’t exclude these shots from still spreading literal DIS ease.</p>
<p>If people’s bodies are being modified to synthetically create toxic proteins then they can still be spreading disease to everyone around them same as if they were creating cyanide in their cells and expelling it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be a viral contagion or bacteria.</p>
<p>Read my other comments in this thread. Covid vaccine shedding is real and I’ve experienced it first hand.</p>

        <p>Germ theory doesn’t have to be true for these shots to still be toxic and hurting others. We have no idea what kind of technology is in these things and what they are actually doing in our bodies. So many stories of unvaccinated people having symptoms after spending time around the vaccinated. If it were just psychosomatic you can’t explain that away so easily, especially considering many people didn’t even know others were vaccinated until AFTER their periods became messed up or started experiencing other symptoms.</p>
<p>Read my other comments in this thread. I speak from personal experience that the vaccinated can and will absolutely cause symptoms in the unvaccinated. Especially in the same household.</p>
<p>Way too many examples of everyone becoming ill immediately after the vaccine to chalk up to psychology. Especially otherwise perfectly healthy people like myself who never get sick beyond a couple days of a runny nose and sore throat.</p>
<p>Germ theory doesn’t have to be true for the spikes or any other stuff produced from the vaccine to be toxic.</p>

        <p>mRNA degrades so it has a limited time period in which it can produce spike proteins in the cells.  So if you're worried, stay away from them as if they were sick for a couple weeks.  </p>
<p>Personally I don't think it's a thing.  I don't see a plausible way for large amounts of spike proteins to be communicable through the airways.  If the immune system couldn't handle them then the person who took the vaccine would be 100X more fucked than you.  On the other hand these vaccines are new, so who knows if they're doing something else.</p>

        <p>We don’t know exactly how the tech in the vaccines modifies how the body handles things.</p>
<p>Hydragel and other military nanotech can potentially be doing things very differently than what is sold to the public.</p>
<p>I speak from personal experience that the effects of spike shedding are very real and are problematic for far longer than just a few weeks.</p>

        <p>I watched a video of a doctor who knows a lot about this stuff. Shedding is not a medical term, but describes something that can happen. However, there is not enough data to say whether this is happening with any of the COVID vaccines or not. It could be happening, it could not be.</p>
