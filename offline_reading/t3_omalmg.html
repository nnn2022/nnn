    <strong>My grandpa is sick after the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>Yesterday I posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/olfc7t/my_grandparents_got_the_vaccine_and_now_they_are/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">this</a> about my grandparents being sick after the vaccine and how my grandpa started slurring words etc. </p>
<p>Now today it's even worse, my mum just came from their house and told me she was talking to him about his phone or something and he couldn't say anything else other than "I don't know what you're talking about". As also mentioned in my post from yesterday I want you to mind he's usually very smart and now he doesn't know what he's saying anymore. My grandma also said he has lost a lot of weight </p>
<p>I know this is not a place for diagnosis but I wanted to ask if anyone else has anyone around them who has had similar things happening to them after getting poisoned and what the outcome was? I'm so scared for them, no one is listening to me except my mom. My grandparents are so blinded it's beyond me</p></p>

        <p>So sorry to hear ❤️! My mother’s husband has a blood clot in his lung, as the result of the vaccine. I spoke to a nurse who said the vaccine landed her in the hospital, I didn’t intrude by asking more details.</p>

        <p>My dad 86 has had a sharp cognitive decline since his JJ shot. He's had a brain scan read only so far by a nurse practioner (Medicare for all anyone?) She said he has an abscess of a tooth which his dentist ( who is the asshole who bullied him into the vax) vehemently disputes. No progress toward a definitive answer yet which seems to be par for course. </p>
<p>They do this with dogs too.  New meds come out. Vets and ads tout it as some miracle. Dogs start dropping dead and the offending drug is quietly pulled never to be spoken of again.</p>

        <p>Yes he does. It's not confirmed yet, he has a doctors appointment on Monday but so far everyone suspects he may have had a stroke</p>
