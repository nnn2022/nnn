    <strong>I am going mental.</strong>
    <p><p>I am going mad. I am torn between appeasing my household family (girlfriend and step-daughter) and shoving a mask on and doing as the government says, being a good, law abiding citizen in supermarkets and all the other wonderful places we can visit... other supermarkets. Or the alternative, not wear one and be interrogated by every "security marshal" that the UK has summoned to its defence and cause my girlfriend distress and anger. I have tried to just accept the nonsense as fact but unfortunately for my critically thinking brain, the statistics do NOT lie and it is driving me insane.</p>
<p>I want my relationship with the love of my life and her daughter to survive what is clearly a collection of lies and misinformation (from the UK government) but I refuse to accept something so evidently false.</p>
<p>I simply cannot comply with what is blatantly not true. It is driving me/us to breaking point and I would appreciate any advice and help put my way. </p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

        <p>Might I add that my girlfriend is not an Orwellian sheep (as per Animal Farm) and fully agrees with me that the Covid-19 Scamdemic is about as factual as the Lord of the Rings. However, she does appreciate a stress free and calm lifestyle for her daughter and my step daughter.</p>

        <p>She needs to understand that by complying and normalizing this now to avoid stress and keep the peace, that she is very likely contributing to a future where her children cannot simply "comply and live in peace" like she could. There will be blood, and it will be her children's blood.</p>

        <p>Have you had the conversation yet about ‘I’m not having the vaccine’</p>
<p>It happened to me a fortnight ago..
The wife’s sister is a carer &amp; she told us she was having it the next day.. and we gets talking &amp; I informed the pair of them that I won’t be having it.
The wife just gave me a look &amp; said ‘well that’s our abroad holidays gone then’</p>
<p>I didn’t feel like telling her it’ll probably mean me losing my job once my employer makes it mandatory.</p>
<p>They’re so wrapped up in the tv news I honestly wouldnt know where to start with them.
If I was to try &amp; tell them this whole narrative of miracle vaccines is a bit off I think I’d have to take them down the rabbit holes of jfk 9/11 wmd’s multinational companies running governments &amp; I know 100% I won’t be thanked for it cos all they wanna do is get back to normal so they’ll acquiesce to  god knows what experimental gene therapy jabs that are thrown at them as well as giving up any basic human rights they’re asked to- all for stepping off the plane in fucking fuerteventura!</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, people are attached to the illusions of the world and want their hedonism so badly. It makes me feel like detaching from almost everybody sometimes, but I have to remain strong and I believe in love and serving others. It is just heartbreaking to see the sadness in everybody wanting things to go back to 'normal'.</p>
