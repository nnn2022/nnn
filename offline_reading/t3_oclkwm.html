        <p>I said that at the very beginning! I asked why we don't have a vaccine for the common cold and everyone said "because it mutates too fast". So I said that we'll have to learn how to live with it like we do with a cold.</p>
<p>Holy shit, you'd think I asked if I could rape your daughter. All I heard was What about Grandma. Or What about the long term effects. Or It's so new we don't know how our immune system will handle it. And FOR FUCKS SAKE they are finding an 800% climb in confirmed infections from the delta variant.</p>
<p>And all that time I asked what was the actual death rate from this new super civilisation destroyer. And all I ever got back was well it's less than 1% +/- .5. </p>
<p>So I have a better chance of getting hit by a bus? I actually looked that one up to prove my argument. And yes it's true from what I was able to learn.</p>
<p>And now I see Singapore is stopping all lockdown/closing measures and only going to report confirmed hospitalization cases and actual deaths from Covid 19 and not co-morbidities. Apparently they think scaring their citizens to death is more harmful than a really bad cold.</p>

        <p>&rt;  "In the vast majority of cases, the infection is asymptomatic or the illness is mild...the majority of people actually have quite effective natural immunity to the virus</p>
<p>No shots, no masks, no nothing.</p>

        <p>They said this over a year ago and speculated that's why children were not being affected. Then they attempted to lock children in their homes for a year and mask them all the while going on about how there might be a variant that will target them. Talk about attempting to create a self fulfilling prophecy. Jokes on them tho bc us "conspiracy theorists" have had our little monsters out there licking shopping carts and eating fruit snacks off the floor of the grocery store so they remain immune to the covid.</p>
