    <strong>The mainstream American left is so very weak in the mind and body</strong>
    <p><p>I work at a place where almost everyone leans left (some extreme far-left), aside from me (best described as libertarian) some maintenance guys and our IT person and his crew. We now have the option to go mask-less here at work and lo and behold, it is just the libertarian/conservatives who are going without one.  Everyone else say the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>I'm scared without a mask. </li>
<li>I don't want to make other people feel uncomfortable (what the fuck?)</li>
<li>"Feeling frightened."</li>
<li>What if I have to work with an un-vaccinated person? (Again, what the fuck? We have worked through this whole pandemic. Get a different job if this is the case). </li>
<li>I'm so very filled with fear. </li>
<li>I like the masks, they keep me anonymous. (why do you have a public job?) </li>
<li>"This is just a dry-run because I'm going to wear my mask all the time in public and for the rest of my life because, you know, humans--germs--sickness."</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll straight up say that I see all of these people differently now.  It has really exposed how utterly cowardly and timid those on the left have become. I'm sure they will be crying in their masks when they are utterly destroyed in the 2022 and 2024 elections. I'll be watching with some popcorn.</p></p>

        <p>There are some very interesting findings from this ridiculous situation we find ourselves in. </p>
<p>It does seem to be a consistent 80% to 20% divide</p>
