    <strong>Went to a wedding in England this week, no one wore a mask and Covid was barely mentioned.</strong>
    <p><p>The doomers would have had a complete meltdown at the normality on display. Close to one hundred guests, no masks, dancing, singing, being in rooms that didn't allow for much social distancing, and barely any mention of the words "Covid", "pandemic", or "jab". There was exactly ONE joke made by someone who was completely off their face drunk about social distancing and being "double jabbed", but that's it. Felt like I had gone back in time to 2019.</p>
<p>I really hope people are just fed up of this shit now and will not comply if restrictions and lockdowns come back during the Winter.</p></p>

        <p>I find that doomers only represent a small population now. Most people could care less about the virus anymore because they understand its not deadly anymore. At least, this is what Ive encountered. </p>
<p>Keep in mind there is still the large portion of internet doomers that will live in their cave until the virus is completely eradicated (which will never happen). </p>
<p>But congrats on a covidless weekend! I can imagine it being quite a refresher! And congratulations to the couple.</p>

        <p>In the real world a lot of people don't seem to be that bothered. Most of the doomer stuff is only online.</p>
