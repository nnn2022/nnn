        <p>I think it's cute that a church would do this. Steps in the right direction should always be applauded. They are making compromise since I'm sure some of their congregation still wear masks, which is fine if that's what they want to do. Sounds like an inclusive church.</p>

        <p>It would only make sense that an institution that builds upon securing an after-life for their people, should reward the people who do not cower in fear at the thought of the horrible fate that should await them if they ever take off their muzzle.  The only logical move as a Christian Church is to do this.  Otherwise, you are saying that this world is the only world and that we should all cower in fear of ever leaving it... so even if the mask only works 0.00001% of the time and the virus only kills 0.0002% of the time with a healthy person, we should all live our lives in complete and unabated fear.</p>

        <p>Incredibly envious. What state? We don't attend in person right now, just meet other families off premises because of our statewide mandates. (I refuse to take my kids to a building full of masks, even though we really miss the services and community.)</p>

        <p>I go to church in Dallas, TX. My parents go to another church in Farmers Branch that has been mask optional the entire time, but it is too far of a drive for me. I pray that your church opens soon and you can be back with your community again! It is very encouraging.</p>

        <p>This is great progress (I suppose?), but I find it pretty hilarious on its face. Is this going to be the new smoking or non-smoking section? And do these idiots really believe that sitting the masked people next to the unmasked people will assuage their irrational fears?</p>

        <p>Agreed! That’s why anytime I went (other than my baptism not too long ago) I avoided wearing a mask. I want to worship my God with my lips and not be distracted by a mask or anything.</p>

        <p>honestly, as a Christian, it's been hard to figure out the appropriate place to land about this stuff. Don't get me wrong, I think COVID hysteria is absolutely ridiculous, and I think universal masks are worthless, and even harmful, for all kinds of reasons. I've never wavered on this for even one second. However, as followers of Christ, and as examples of Christ, we're called to do some pretty radical things. Sometimes we're called to make even better choices than the choices that are merely reasonable.</p>
<p>for me, the two trickiest issues in this case are, one, to submit even to unjust governments, trusting that God has allowed them their power, trusting that God is using them for good, even when they're in the wrong. That's radical! And then, two, to avoid even the appearance of evil, so that even when people judge wrongly or poorly, they are still kept from being repelled by your conduct, and the image of the Christian body is not tarnished. This is SO difficult! There are SO MANY views!</p>
<p>it's especially difficult when there's something like this COVID nonsense, which is being portrayed with an extremely heavy hand as though there is a legitimate consensus behind it. And to an extent, there is a consensus, but on the other hand, the consensus is being deceived! It's a mess. It's very difficult to make a prudent decision about.</p>
<p>for me, I feel like the deciding factor is that I'm doing an even more significant evil to the people around me by going along with the thing. Because, ultimately, I'm not excused if I'm uncomfortable, and I'm not excused if I have rational justification for what I'm doing, but if I'm doing wrong to other people, then I really am obligated to minimize the wrong. I think it's legit harmful if I allow myself to be taken as though I am corroborating this COVID hysteria, because being swept up in the hysteria hurts a person for sure, and social pressure is what causes it to happen to him. So to me, this is the most prudent position I can come up with, and I don't know any better argument. But even to this day, I know for sure all this COVID stuff is garbage, but I still don't know whether I'm doing the right thing or not when I resist it.</p>
<p>thanks for reading.</p>

        <p>I am religious, but for me, I don't just think about what my religion says, I think about my own opinions. There are a few little things that I disagree with in my religion. If my religion bought into all of this, there's no way I'd agree with them. Find the religion that lines up most with your beliefs, I guess.</p>

        <p>I guess it depends why you do what you do. Maybe in your case, you have your own things worked out, you have your own internal models to help you make sense of the world, and your models largely overlap with those of an established belief system, and so you qualify as sharing in that belief system. Me personally, my models would never in a million years have overlapped with those of Christianity. My models were absolutely opposed to those of Christianity. I just discovered eventually that there is a God who knows better than I do, and he's right all the damn time, and my own thing is basically trash, so now I just try to deal with it, and I try to adopt the better model and leave mine alone.</p>

        <p>I love this. I don’t go to church but I think it’s cool that since many churches want to talk about how they’re welcoming to all this church is doing just that. All are welcome and have choices. Both a choice to come and then a choice of where to sit that will make each person feel as welcome as possible.  The people who want to mask don’t have to walk through the section of those who don’t.</p>

        <p>I think once we have more services like this, people in the back will want to start joining the people in the front. It’s new and scary for some, but I just hope that we don’t have controversy over this and fight each other. The point of the Church is to be one body, for Christ, and we can’t do that unless we are all together as one without discourse. So far, so good though!</p>

<p>It’s the same reason you don’t put the smoking section between the entrances and the non-smoking section.  The non-smokers complain about having to walk thru the smoke to get to their table.</p>
