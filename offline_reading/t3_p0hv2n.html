    <strong>Connect The Dots In The Uk.</strong>
    <p><p>Of the deaths where both influenza and pneumonia, and COVID-19 were mentioned on the death certificate, the underlying cause of death was COVID-19 in 95.8% (18,642 deaths) of cases. This is compared with 0.04% (eight deaths) of deaths where influenza and pneumonia were the underlying cause of death. </p>

<p>Medical practitioners are required to certify causes of death “to the best of their knowledge and belief”. Without diagnostic proof, if appropriate and to avoid delay, medical practitioners can circle ‘2’ in the MCCD (“information from post-mortem may be available later”) or tick Box B on the reverse of the MCCD for ante-mortem investigations. For example, if before death the patient had symptoms typical of COVID19 infection, but the test result has not been received, it would be satisfactory to give ‘COVID-19’ as the cause of death.</p>

<p>If you read through both of these, i think its reasonable to theorize that there is a mass misdiagnosis of covid 19.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think, is this the same in your country to?</p></p>
