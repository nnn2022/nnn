    <strong>Request for input about relocation out of NY state</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all, I am living in the people‚Äôs republic of NYC , I was born in Brooklyn long ago and grew up from the age of 7 to 18 in the adirondacks which I absolutely love and then came back to NYC for school and work and I have been here for decades. I am a middle aged woman with no family and many in my friend group have lost their minds this year over this situation. My friends who maintained their sanity and see through this are all planning moves out. My ex H is my best friend right now (funny how that worked out üòä) we are on the same page here and he is interested in leaving as well. All of this has caused people to cluster into groups according to their ideologies and whatever dogma they have embraced.  I am in a position now where I am working remotely , my job made an announcement we will only need to come in possibly twice a year so I don‚Äôt need to live here anymore. I can leave.</p>
<p>I hate hot weather and humidity and I don‚Äôt want to be on the west coast. I love the northeast , I love mountains and lakes and winters. I have a week off coming up and I want to visit someplace new I might move to. My question is, does anyone have any recommendations as to where I might consider that has more normalcy, less Cuomo style tyrannical ‚Äúleadership‚Äù, less people who are obsessed with masks and vaccines etc. someplace with people who value freedom and a normal life and they aren‚Äôt living in constant fear? I have applied here for a pistol permit and I plan on learning how to defend myself so I would like to be able to own a firearm where I live as well. I was considering going back upstate because I adore upstate NY but NYC controls our government as far as governor. Upstate does have some great sherriffs and mayors and local governments do have a role in the local environment and rules. I need to make new friends and find a nice community. I have no idea where to start looking. It seems like the entire northeast is the worst area of this country besides CA. I am at a loss. </p>
<p>Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated , thank you!</p></p>

        <p>West Virginia is actually incentivising people to move to the state monetarily to work from home. Im seriously considering it.
The worst things I could find for not moving there is a crumbling infrastructure, highest opioid addiction in all states and senior care is not so good,where is it though?
Go on Zillow and look at houses for sale in WV, you will fall out of your chair after living in NY.
You should be a Patriot if you plan on getting along with the populace.</p>

        <p>My exh actually mentioned it, have you gone? It's funny but houses in areas of upstate ny are next to nothing... Of course they are areas that are economy depressed without much to do. Maybe I should start looking at w VA though ... I've heard bad things about the opiod crisis and the poverty too like you said.</p>

        <p>I'm going into Mathias County soon to scout around. It's 6 hours by car from NY second county in on NE side of state. Property taxes on houses there are ridiculous, 4 BR ,2 bath
 $900 a year. I pay that a month in NY.
See depending on where you decide you could be 5 hours to 10 hours from NY by car.</p>

        <p>I will Def look into this! I was looking at upstate ny where I grew up and taxes were avg 2k a YEAR lol... I do have the advantage of having grown up outside of the city. My father passed away when I was five and my mother moved us upstate with her family so I grew up around a lot of patriotic people, lots of conservatives, I saw a lots of guns, people doing outdoorsy stuff. So I have experienced Both Worlds. I have lived in the city for a very long time but I'm not a typical New York City person. I was a dem until 3 years ago but I was never an SJW kind of dem. I don't think Republicans and conservatives are evil murderous devils, I'm not a trump fanatic but I do see the way he was constantly demonized by the media and the dem party. I have no political affiliation anymore. I would have no problem living around people who are patriotic. I don't have TDS and I don't feel like people with Trump lawn signs are racist criminals lol</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs a town with only 300. There are no chain stores or restaurants so there were no masks anywhere since I got here last fall. Only time I had to wear one is if i went into North Conway (about 45 minutes away) to a big box store. You really need to go about an hour north of Maskachusetts border to be away from the zombies that believe their TV. People here are farmers and outdoorsy and all mostly seem to be very pro personal Liberty. Buying firearms is like buying a case of beer. In and out. People are much more respectful of each other. I think part of that is due to knowing everyone is/could be carrying. Lowest gun violence rate in the country. Zero diversity (if that matters to you). Cleanest air in the country. I could go on lol...</p>

        <p>I should add that low wage jobs appear to be plentiful and there‚Äôs lots of help wanted signs. You‚Äôd need to be willing to drive to get a higher paying job or just be lucky to be able to work from home. As for the diversity, i mentioned that as some may not want to live in a place without it. I haven‚Äôt personally encountered overt racists or anything like that so I‚Äôd imagine your skin color wouldn‚Äôt matter much to anyone. Everyone seems mostly interested in keeping to themselves and not encroaching on others lives. Also, having been in Mass for quite a while, it‚Äôs refreshing to be out of the ‚Äúkeeping up with the Joneses‚Äù mentality.</p>
