    <strong>We need solidarity, stop thinking small.</strong>
    <p><p>I think as a whole we‘re not thinking globally enough. Yes, I know globalism has a bad rap but hear me out.</p>
<p>I’m in Australia and used to be pro border control. Now? Not so much.</p>
<p>The other day I made a post praising the US, and how amazing it was as a country. This post was really well received. I got many upvotes, and some really nice comments. One of them was “Please move here.We need more people like you.” - 101 upvotes</p>
<p>”Get out while you still can, the US needs more freedom-loving people like you” - 22 upvotes</p>
<p>”I wish I could sponsor people like you.Get you all here in Florida.” - 5 upvotes.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>You know what I <em>didn’t</em> get? One single PM. Nothing. Not one. Now what was I expecting? Was I expecting a PM saying “i‘ve bought you a plane ticket, come to Florida and fuck my wife”? No, of course not. But what about “Hey man, I don’t if you can leave or whatever but if you ever get to Oklahoma, my uncle has a ranch, he’s always looking for workers.” Just something.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Now why would anyone do this? Because this is entirely differen. This isn’t the Rwandan genocide, where no-one knew what the fuck was going on. This isn’t like the confusing Protestant-Catholic feud in Ireland. It’s pretty clear what’s happening. This isn’t a regionalised problem guys. Do you think our oppressors are thinking within national borders?? What the hell do you think the G7 was all about?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>I hate to use the term solidarity here as it’s a very left wing term but it’s appropriate, it’s what we need.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Do you guys think I want my country flooded with people from a different race, religion, language, culture?? Previously my answer was no way, I don’t want Sydney to turn into Little Cambodia.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>But now? Freedom loving Cambodians <em>are</em> my people. Transgender Costa Ricans who are against this craziness <strong>are my people</strong> . Do you know what my previous people (Anglo Saxon Australians) did to me? Shut business’s down, acted as spies for the cops, laughed at protestors getting bashed. Almost all cops are Anglo Saxon english speaking Australians. You think <strong>they’re</strong> my people???? I feel much more at home with people speaking a language I can’t understand that aren’t <em>crazy</em>. </p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Race doesn’t matter, nor religion, nor gay/trans and in my opinion, visa status.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>Do you guys want a country without illegal immigrants or do you want allies?</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>I’m not encouraging anyone to commit crime. But let me end with this : if you see a regular poster on here, and y’all have a few private PM’s, and hit it off. Maybe have a few Zoom chats too etc. If this guy makes his way to the US, are you legally obliged to check his immigration status before letting him put a sleeping bag in your backyard?</p></p>

        <p>not sure what this rant is about, but i am getting the impression you dont understand the opposite of no borders/let everyone in is NOT anti immigration. Borders expedite the process of immigration and allow refugess and those who do things legally to enter the country quickly, and ensures sufficient support to refugees.  Its not anti immigrant to want that.</p>

        <p>Ok, obviously being an American you’ve never had to apply for a visa to America. It’s exceptionally difficult. Why do you think Mexicans sneak across the border? If it was a case of borders allowing “those who do things legally to enter the country quickly” surely they’d just do the paperwork right? </p>
<p>As far as I can see, there is no way I could enter the US legally. When I finish University I could apply for a working visa but it’s unlikely that would work as I’d need a us company to sponsor me and my field is oversaturated in the US. </p>
<p>I will also not be able to finish University anyway as in my country we will very soon need the vaccine to attend school/university.</p>

        <p>Ok, got it. We have most of the world leaders bar some African countries that are going about a coordinated effort to strip away all rights we have. And instead of teaming up, nationalism will help us prevail. </p>
<p>Fuck the Scottish, fuck the Japanese, fuck the Swedish and so on. </p>
<p>I genuinely help things remain ok in the US because if the day comes that you’d like some backup it won’t be there, all citizens of other countries will be in prison cells. </p>
<p>Best of luck, hope you don’t need it.</p>

        <p>Ok, no problem, I’ll try to keep it short. </p>
<p>Pretend you tell me about where you are (USA?) and how it’s awful. Can’t get a drivers license without vaccine, violent police whatever, doesn’t matter. </p>
<p>If I’m in a safe, free country (I’m not but pretend) I should be saying to you (after a few zoom calls to screen out crazies) “bro, my friend has a property, he says if it’s that bad in US, you can come here and pick fruit and in return sleep in a sleeping bag in the paddock”.  If you’re one of the NNN people, i should try to help you. Who cares if you get here on a holiday visa and don’t leave? Like really, the world has gone insane, let’s help each other, not worry about status.</p>
