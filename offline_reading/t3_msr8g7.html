    <p><p>LINK: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210415164430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/04/15/locking-whole-streets-could-way-stop-new-covid-variants-says/">Locking down whole streets could be way to stop new Covid variants, says expert</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Dr Jeffrey Barrett, director of the Covid-19 Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210415164430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/10/08/majority-people-test-positive-coronavirus-asymptomatic-tested/">interventions to minimise asymptomatic transmission</a> could be crucial.<br>
...<br>
When questioned if shutting down entire streets would have a medical impact on clusters of cases, he responded: “Well it certainly could, because one of the trickiest parts of this virus overall is, of course, some individuals who are infected don't have symptoms and so they can transmit.<br>
“Trying to use interventions that might stop asymptomatic transmission may well be an important part of keeping outbreaks of these new variants to be as absolutely small as possible."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
He added there could be a “chance” new variants will be “less well neutralised” by vaccines, so “it's really important to be able to try to keep that number as close to zero as possible”.<br>
Restrictions have so far kept the number of new variants “very small”, he said, adding: “And as the restrictions are lifted the key thing to watch will be, does that number ever go up sort of week by week, and if so it's really important to deploy the most effective measures possible to contain those outbreaks."</p></p>
