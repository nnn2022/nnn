<p>Here again for a link a day, posting consecutively for over a... oh, it’s midnight.</p>
<p>... eh, see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><a href="https://imperfectplan.com/2020/12/14/false-dr-roger-hodkinson-did-not-call-covid-19-a-hoax/">https://imperfectplan.com/2020/12/14/false-dr-roger-hodkinson-did-not-call-covid-19-a-hoax/</a></p>
<p>Recently saw a post here on a phone call with Dr Roger Hodkinson, Canadian pathologist, stating how media had exacerbated the risk of COVID for the sake of power. Naturally, the next logical step was to look up the name Roger Hodkinson and see what said politicians did to him, cause you know this week’s word is “disinformation” after all. COVID? Yeah, we’ve been cracking on safety risks, but let’s take a break from that for just one week to tell you about insurrectionists resurrecting Exodia by convincing the public we, your rulers, are <em>wrong!</em></p>
<p>Anyways there was certainly a laundry list of people bitching about how he said COVID was fake news (in of itself fake news, shocker), but thankfully I did find this one article here, which also contains the doctor’s interview, discrediting the other 90% of news, not by stalwartly defending this radicalist traitor against all reason, but by frankly addressing the facts. He said <em>this,</em> not <strong>that.</strong> In the world of politics, half a story can be just as convincing as the whole story you know?</p>
<p>But hey, the news finally addressed the Uighur camps genocide, even likening it to a modern day holocaust. Progress! Now if we could only get them to acknowledge the existence of Ho-</p></p>
