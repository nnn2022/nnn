        <p>I live in East Tennessee and we resumed life after the shutdown in April 2020, during which went to Walmart, the laundromat, the liquor store, et cetera. We haven't seen any of the dire warnings and predictions happen. I've known people who tested positive,  they didn't go to the hospital and said loss of taste and smell was the worst symptom. I don't of anyone that has died, I don't know of anyone who has known anyone that has died. According to the "experts" we should be deceased by now, due to hospitals being overwhelmed, et cetera.</p>

        <p>If our governor had not panicked, we would have led the nation in economy, as the majority of people in East Tennessee don't trust the government and benefit from tourism. When Nashville joined the Confederacy, East Tennessee refused and was occupied by a hostile Confederate army. We should have been the state of Franklin after the Civil War, as West Virginia was awarded statehood from Viginia. If our state capital was in Knoxville and we had a hillbilly as our governor, our people would not have suffered loss of livelihood. Because everyone around the Smokey Mountains knew this was bullshit, from the moment China allowed their people to travel for New Year and Trump didn't stop international travel.</p>

        <p>East Tennessee has a tradition of rejecting government bullshit... When Nashville joined the Confederacy, East Tennessee refused and was occupied by a hostile Confederate Army. We should have become a separate state after the Civil War, as West Virginia was rewarded. Then volunteers witnessed the Indian Removal  Act, so this region has a historical distrust of authority. At least we have the mountains to retreat into, when tyranny is forced upon US. They never did get all the Cherokee in the Smokey Mountains, and they will never get all of US, as this area was a mecca for survivalists and doomsday preppers, long before the recent influx of northerners and westerners fleeing taxes and laws.</p>

        <p>This is also what "excess deaths" is referencing. Some scientist come up with a number of how many people they expect to die in the coming year. Then everything above that is "excess".</p>
<p>The more damning part to that narrative is that the majority of 2020's excess death were in the 20's and 30's age brackets, which was a bracket barely touched by COVID deaths. I wonder if something else happened in 2020 that could have caused young people just starting in careers, with low savings,  who are more susceptible to drug and alcohol abuse, depression, and suicide than older age ranges to die more than expected... Hmmm...</p>

        <p>16% more deaths in 2020 compared to 2019. The highest number since 1918:

<p>These are only England and Wales, they don't include Schottland and Northern Ireland. That's where the difference probably comes from.</p>

        <p>Yes, but even the normalized mortality rate was falling for at least 20 years and suddenly spiked again.</p>
<p>In the last 20 years many things happened that reduced mortality rate. Among other things much fewer people smoke, car accidents have become less fatal (around 2000 air bags became the norm in cars), etc.</p>
<p>Is this not proof that something happened in 2020 and 2021 that killed a great number of people? What does downplaying this fact achieve?</p>

        <p>If it's not unprecedented to past years, what's the issue? High deaths per 100k happen. Flu deaths are almost zero, yet covid is high? Flu was re-branded and we had a bad year for it. Bad flu seasons happen. </p>

<p>On page 54 you find the recorded death rate for influence in the last 5 years. I couldn't find any data reaching further back.</p>
<p>In the worst year (2017/2018) there were 22k deaths due to influenza in the UK. In other years it was 15k or less. Covid has caused 100k deaths in one year.</p>

        <p>But this is where we disagree, it was not covid that killed them, deaths were noted on a positive test alone, it had nothing to do with cause. This was spoken about for months. Positive within 60 days was written as with covid. It is completely screwing with the figures. </p>
<p>Conservative MP Paul Bristow said:</p>
<p>“It’s almost certain that a number of deaths have been wrongly attributed to Covid-19. Not only has this skewed figures when data has been so important in deciding how we respond to the pandemic, it has caused distress and anxiety for relatives. Whether we have received the most appropriate figures should definitely be considered in any future inquiry.”</p>

        <p>I don't get your line of argumentation.</p>
<p>There is no difference between last year and other years - but there is: 100k more people died than in the years before.</p>
<p>But if you take the mortality rate there is no difference to 20 years ago - yes but this was 20 years ago and mortality rate has improved since then.</p>
<p>It wasn't COVID-19 just a bad flu season - even of this was true 100k more people died. It doesn't matter if this was COVID-19 or another disease. It's 5x as many extra deaths as in a bad flu season, despite all the (often dumb) countermeasures.</p>
<p>I'm not arguing about how the situation was handled by politicians, just the denial that there was/is a pandemic and this is not "just a bad flu season".</p>

        <p>&rt;I don't get your line of argumentation.</p>
<p>What you are failing to understand is that attributing the spike in mortality rate this year to Covid alone is a flawed line of thinking. The death rate is not unprecedented and is even quite a bit lower compared to some other bad years in the past where excess mortality was not narrowly attributed to one single cause, so this shows that there can be excess death without a pandemic "ravaging" society.</p>
<p>Now, could Covid have caused all of that excess death this past year? Yep, possibly. Don't state that as a fact though, because it's not supported.</p>
<p>I believe lockdowns in combination with the malpractice of public health solely focusing on Covid, blatantly ignoring all other illnesses and diseases out there, as well as the impact the psychological warfare has had on people has been a greater contributor to the excess death in 2020. That belief holds just as much weight as yours does.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to explain this away by stating that healthcare has improved since the early 2000's when the mortality rate was overall higher. I say that healthcare quality has dropped below 2000's levels and in some cases is simply non-existent. 10 million missed cancer screenings in the US alone. A vast increase of reluctance in the public to visit hospitals for serious, life-threatening diseases that are otherwise treatable, for fear of contracting coronavirus. Nearly 40% drop in patients treated for severe heart attacks after March 2020 compared to the year before. Need I go on?</p>

        <p>I'm simply saying I disagree with your claim that covid caused 100k deaths and many many others also from politicians to doctors.</p>
<p>You cannot simply use the last few years and go WOW a spike in death rate and blanket ignore the fact that for 10+ years straight from at least 1993 to 2003 it was similar and say it is unprecedented. It isn't. It's just a fact. Is it a change from a recent trend? Yup but not unprecedented. What caused all of those high per 100k deaths? Nothing did, did it. It was just high and when we get close to that again it must be some kind of deadly virus?</p>
<p>I don't understand what's complicated about this. </p>
<p>You have no idea why it dropped from 2003 to 2004 from this years deaths per 100k high to the lowest. But we know why it went high? Utterly nonsensical, when we use it in the context of pcr false positive rates and take just plain lies on death certificates into account. If it wasn't the rona it was NORMAL, I mean, its fairly simple.</p>

        <p>&rt; There is quite literally no x axis on this graph.</p>
<p>That is the whole point... The guy who tweeted this removed it and mixed up the bars deliberately to make the point that you can't tell which year is which. That should not be the case if COVID were as deadly as many people feared or claimed. If it were, one bar should be noticeably longer than all the rest and that bar would indicate 2020. He also said he would be adding the x-axis in a later tweet so people could see if they accurately guessed which year was 2020.</p>
<p>Missing the point of a tweet is not a gotcha on the person making the tweet. This argument is like getting a fill in the blank quiz and then calling them out because the sentences are incomplete an have blanks in them.</p>

        <p>But with no x axis there is no proof that 2020 is even on the graph? You're just blindly trusting that this guy has added a year on an axis that doesn't exist and trusting he wouldn't manipulate the data to enhance his own viewpoint? For people who aren't a fan of groupthink; this is very trusting.</p>

        <p>I notice you still haven't answered my question. This time last year was summer coming out of the only strict lockdown we've had (petrol prices dropped, no cars on road etc). September we had our 2 week, "circuit breaker" lockdown, and since then it's been there's never been fully adhered to lockdowns, and community spread has become rife, unlike last summer. Along with variants making the situation worse, and majority of spread in the 11-44 age bracket. You know, least likely to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>How many deaths and infections would have happened if we didn't have lockdowns you think?</p>

<p>Crude Mortality Rate went from 893 to 1,016 from 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>That is the highest it is has been since 2003.</p>
<p>That is around an extra 70,000 deaths in one year.</p>
<p>In particular, looking at death figures, April 2020 saw a 100% increase in deaths YoY (from 44k to 88k)</p>
<p>But, you know....easier to just share Dick Delingpole's random graph, where he has purposely jumbled up the years, instead of doing the research yourself....which is odd considering that is all you spooks go on about</p>

        <p>What caused all those "excess" deaths for the 10+ years leading up to 2003 then? Multiple pandemics? Or just bad years? Because 2020 is NOT unprecedented. </p>

        <p>Wait, you genuinely think that the UK healthcare <strong>hasn't</strong> improved since 2003? </p>
<p>What are you smoking, fella?</p>
<p>Since 2003 we have seen the following change (all of which attribute to better 'public health')</p>
<p>- The indoor smoking ban which caused a large decrease in individuals smoking </p>
<p>- Tobacco advertising ban</p>
<p>- The sugar levy (increasing the prices of drinks containing over 8g os guar)</p>
<p>- The Marmot Review of 2010</p>
<p>- Congestion charge and ultra-low emission zones (which has seen substantial emission reductions)</p>
<p>- Wellbeing of Future Generations Act </p>
<p>The list goes on and on. </p>
<p>Add to that further scientific advancements....</p>

<p>When presenting chronological data, you should place that data chronologically to see any trends etc.</p>

        <p>&rt;So what's your point</p>
<p>Mortality rates had been falling significantly since 2003. Yes, they have been higher in the past but an increase of 13% CMR goes against the trend that we were seeing. </p>
<p>&rt;It isn't unprecedented. Fact. </p>
<p>This is correct, it isn't unprecedented. However, if I presented data like this to a client (whereby an increase in numbers was bad) they would see 2020's increase and immediately question <em>why</em> there was such an increase.</p>
<p>&rt;Given we have a much higher population too</p>
<p>That is why you use CMR to get a good figure on mortality rates, and not 'recorded deaths'</p>
<p><strong>So, simply put - what caused such an increase in the CMR last year?</strong></p>

        <p>I'm sorry you're so angry. Millions of people think that the response to the virus (global lockdowns etc) was far out of proportion to the virus. Your data shows that we've seen this many deaths before, recently, in our lifetime, and no one batted an eye. That's essentially what the post is saying, too. Counting every case on a ticker constantly skewed some perspectives, in millions of people's opinion, and in reality the results of this virus wouldn't have given many people pause before this last year.</p>

        <p>You are correct and i can understand why those people are angry (for the most part, I'm one of those people). My issue is purely in the way this data is presented. </p>
<p>A 13% increase in CMR is a significant increase (maybe not significant enough to warrant the response to this virus). </p>
<p>This data purposely portrays chronological data with no logical pattern to hide that increase. Would you not deem that as misleading?</p>

        <p>Not at all, the tweet says he's mixing up the years, to see if such a year would stand out if hidden in recent years. Certainly not misleading, since it describes exactly what the chart shows, and imo an interesting thought experiment. Such a significant year NOT being an obvious pop-out is what the tweet is pointing out. This is a great way to more objectively look at data, it reminds me a bit at this moment of artists flipping a reference picture upside down to better focus on shapes and light.</p>

        <p>I don't believe the intent of the jumbled graph is to be misleading. I personally see it as an example of how exaggerated the response is and was considering the idea that if you were to jumble the years as he has done in the graph none stand out as an obvious increase in loss of life. It shows that there is a yearly variation and that 2020 was no more an extreme than other years with a tad bit higher death rate</p>

        <p>Because a lack of an experienced phenomena does not deny it's existence. For example if you lived in California your whole life you probably would never have experienced aurora borealis, but just because you did not experience that, does not mean it doesn't exist. While you're trying to apply this same exact logic to whether covid killed anyone or not. Just because you did not experience it personally does not mean it never happened. Does murders never happen cause you don't know anyone who were? Does car accidents not happen because you did not see one?</p>

        <p>But as I JUST explained and you ignored, your way of using this argument is based on trying to prove something isn't true based on a lack of an experience with such phenomena when in practice this kind of argumentation is worthless. At the same time arguing for a phenomena by using an experience of such phenomena DOES work. I.e. "My dad died in a car accident" shows that car accidents are real, while on the contraey saying "Car accidents never happen cause I know nobody who died in an accident" does not deny the existence of car accidents. The only thing you can argue in this case is that what these people died of was something other than covid, which would also not make sense because of the mortality rates of the covid illness compared to something like influenzea. This will be the last time I repeat myself cause you are obviously not inclined to listen.</p>

        <p>It very well may have been something other than covid, it has been known for a while now testing has inflated numbers. It's a fact. Because he said it was covid doesn't mean it was. At least you can see the car accident. Glad you're gonna stop replying. Cheers!</p>

        <p>First - no you probably didn’t. Second - if you did you are a massive statistical anomaly. Like call up Guinness because the odds of this happening with the death rates we have are so near 0% you can basically dismiss your claim out of hand.</p>

        <p>It means that those with 3-4 pre-existing conditions, like the flu, respiratory disease from years of cigarette smoking, hypertension and diabetes related to grotesque obesity died in 2020 instead of in the next couple of years due to 'death involving covid19'.</p>

        <p>Just as an FYI - the excess deaths in 2017 for the UK (winter period) was 50,100. That was the highest recorded since 1975. </p>
<p>Interstingly, excess deaths in 2020 (winter period) were actually lower, at 28,300. It is worth noting that this was, however, a yearly increase of 19% (compared to 2019's winter period).</p>
<p>So some good, some bad. </p>
<p>But nowhere can I find UK excess deaths being 400,000 over the course of the year. Do you have a source for that figure? I cannot seem to find the yearly excess deaths on the ONS site.</p>
