    <strong>Kinda Scared</strong>
    <p><p>I’d say I’m pretty young, I’ll leave that up to you guys for interpretation. I’m a lot more curious than most of my friends which could explain how I ended up here. First off: I do believe COVID is a real virus that can have harmful effects on those who catch it. HOWEVER, a lot of this vaccine stuff has been extremely sketchy and I am confused to why people are not calling more out about it. From what I’ve seen on the subreddit, the best I can hope for is that this pandemic’s purpose is a big money grab for big pharmaceutical companies. Worst case scenario, which I really do not want to believe, is that this is the start of something a lot worse (I’ll leave that up to you for interpretation). The majority of the people I love and hang out with were fully vaccinated, before I learned about this sub. I am part of the minority consisting of me and a few others. I really want to believe that is just some cash grab and that we’ll return to normal soon. As someone in this thread said, seeing the people you love suffering and dying is not pleasant at all and I hope everything works out in the end. I’m not old at all. It seemed like my life was just about to really start. Now, its all crashing down. I am praying to God that this is not what I think it is and that everyone I love will be ok.</p></p>

        <p>It's too big too just be a cash grab unfortunately. The amount of money and pressure they're spending to maintain this absurd narrative globally is more than just a few billion in pharma profits.</p>
<p>At the very least it's a cash and unlimited POWER grab. The bigger cash grab using stimuluses may be part of it.</p>
<p>Population control seems likely as well, but best case scenario it's through reduced fertility only.</p>
<p>But since you believe in God, you might want to brush up on Revelations and the mark of the beast for the worst case scenario.</p>

        <p>They definitely already have the mark ready to go. I really think the purpose of the vaccine (well one of the purposes besides harm) is sort of a "beta test" for the mark itself. Now they know which propaganda works best and what doesn't. How many people will willingly get it just because they were told to. How many people purposely avoided it and how certain countries react to it. Thankfully I don't think they know who the antichrist is and without him I don't think they can release the mark yet. I could be wrong though and the antichrist is already found and they're just waiting for the right time.</p>

        <p>I'm in my 30's, not super old but have a couple of years under my belt to know not to trust the government or big pharma. We really are living in strange times that will be studied by future societies. It's difficult for young people to have their innocence taken away and their bubble burst. But many of us have been through this. It just sucks that you are going through it as a young person. My heart goes out to you. I will say this. YOU are stronger than you think and when you aren't feeling particularly well mentally then you need to have family and friend time. Don't talk politics or covid, just spend time with loved ones. These bad times will pass. It might not seem that way sometimes but the scare tactics will die down eventually. Might take some time but hang in there. WE are always going to be here for YOU. We are here to give advice and comfort. 
Your family will most likely be fine but they took an unnecessary risk. My parents and brother also were vaxed and they are fine so far as well. But there is a risk and it is unnecessary to take it. Do not believe the scare tactics. You do NOT have to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. Trust your gut. You also DO NOT have to explain yourself to anyone. You are a strong person and will get stronger with life experience. Things get easier to deal with in time. If you ever feel cornered or pushed against a wall, bullied etc. reach out to this sub and we will help you. YOU are not alone and never will be.</p>
<p>I'm scatter brained right now but it's extremely important to try and remain optimistic. I am. Even though there is some evil corporatism BS going on. 
If you need videos or other resources to try to persuade people to not get vaxed let me know but I don't want to scare you. Young people have insane hormones and emotions so it can be shocking and hard to deal with for some.  I cannot stress enough how important it is to remain optimistic. Seriously. Protect your mental health at all costs. Take long news and social media breaks, have family and friend time and reach out to this sub whenever you need to. I have faith in you :)</p>

        <p>I feel the same way, and from the beginning in March 2020 I was afraid covid was a bio weapon, however released, and we were going to have mass vaccinations. There are a handful of viral lab leak examples that have occurred over the past 20-30+ years. My fear is it will be found to be a viral lab leak from China, and there will be an on going 5-10+ years public propaganda campaign to protect the population as a result. Or worse another power grab by those in such positions both in corporate America and in government to take away more of our civil liberties. Worst case scenario military incursions as a result. </p>
<p>I wondered how I was going to react when the "mass vaccination" time was going to occur. I've stood my ground. We will see if I have lost my job if they ever become mandatory.</p>
<p>Seeing how the stock market and big companies have benefited from this situation is mind boggling and how people don't see this is more baffling. Most of my social groups just want things back to normal, so they either got injected or use that as their "carrot" or coping to keep themselves going through this period of time.</p>
<p>I myself have lost more from the social damages, with family, friends and job as a result of COVID than the actual virus physically.</p>
<p>God bless and God speed to us all. Hopefully we are wrong and things turn around.</p>

<p>It's best to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. </p>
<p>But as Bruce Lee said- you don't wish for an easy life- but pray for the strength to endure a hard one. </p>
<p>And that doesn't apply to what we think about COVID- that applies to life in general. </p>
<p>We'll be alright. The truth is- we don't know what the future holds for all of us. I'd rather not waste it worrying about what could happen. Life is too short for that.</p>
