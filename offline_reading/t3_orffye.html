    <strong>2nd Update: Outcome of my previous posts about the private university I work for mandating the vaccine as a requirement for work (Ohio, USA)</strong>
    <p><p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>This one is going to be very, very long. Many of you commented and asked me to post an update about my situation after my first posts about this, so here you are. A brief recap: I work for a private university in Ohio that announced last week that as of this past Friday, July 23rd, the vaccine is now a condition of our employment. They are allowing medical and religious exemptions, and I qualify for a medical exemption on the grounds that I have a clotting disorder and a heart condition that could lead to serious complications from the vaccine, and I don't have any reason to hide this information, but I feel that releasing to them the health information they're asking for in order to submit for the exception sets a dangerous precedent for what our employers are allowed to require from us. </p>
<p>You can read the original posts here:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I do not have fantastic news to share with you all, although I did reach a conclusion with them that I can live with. As expected, my concerns were not taken seriously or even addressed. I was responded to by someone from the university legal department, who, as you can see in the copied response, basically just said "No, what we're doing is legal because I said it is. Just do it so you don't kill grandma. Thanks."</p>
<p>&rt;Dear <em>edited,</em></p>
<p>&rt;I am responding to your email on behalf of President <em>edited</em> and Provost <em>edited.</em>  The vaccine requirements that the university announced yesterday comply with both federal and state law.  The legal provisions and other documents that you cite are inapplicable to the university's vaccine policy. This policy is designed to protect the safety of our campus community by following federal guidance, as well as advice from experts in public health and infectious disease.</p>
<p>&rt;We do recognize that receiving vaccines involves personal choice; it is for this reason that the university's policy includes an exemption process. While you have stated that you do not want to provide information needed to participate in such a process, I encourage you to at least consider this option by viewing the respective forms available at the Office of Equity website.</p>
<p>&rt;Thank you.</p>
<p>&rt;Sincerely,
&rt;<em>Edited</em></p>
<p>Involves personal choice. </p>
<p>Involves. </p>
<p>Jesus H.Christ. </p>
<p><em>INVOLVES</em> personal choice???? I think the fuck not. </p>
<p>It IS personal choice, and ONLY personal choice. Period. I was irate.</p>
<p>I spoke with a lawyer at this point. (A real lawyer, not a reddit lawyer, though God bless that first one, whoever and wherever he may be). The lawyer was very sympathetic to my situation and I got lucky that he wasn't a rabid vaxxer, as a friend in the same predicament talked to a lawyer who was and he simply urged her to get the vaccine. That's helpful. Anyway, the lawyer gave me some tips and pointers but basically said yes, based on all the new laws and things surrounding the pandemic, what my employer is doing is not only legal, but if I'm fired for noncompliance, I can't even get unemployment.</p>
<p>So much for freedom. Yay 'Murica.</p>
<p>Here is my response to his blasé "just do it" answer, based on what the lawyer told me:</p>
<p>&rt;Mr. <em>Edited,</em></p>
<p>&rt;Thank you for your response. I have reviewed the forms you are requesting of staff members for an exemption, but I regret to say that I will not be submitting these forms to <em>edited</em> University at this time.</p>
<p>&rt;The forms I must submit for a medical exemption request personal and private information pertaining to my medical history.  They require an open-ended release of information to my doctor in order to submit the exemption, without an expiration date for said release.  There is no space on the form to specifically note what records of mine are allowed to be shared with <em>edited</em> University, or who at <em>edited</em> University may access them.  The forms also imply that the university may reject the validity of my claim for medical exemption despite confirmation from my licensed physician if the university does not agree with the assessment of my physician that it could be life-threatening for me to receive a covid-19 vaccine due to my health circumstances.  My privacy, and my doctor's and my own decisions for my health needs, are not up for debate. </p>
<p>&rt;I do not acknowledge that my employer has any authority over or rights to my health history, medical decisions, medical testing, medical needs, medical records, or vaccination status simply by virtue of being my employer.  I was not hired with the expectation that mandatory vaccinations or disclosure of personal and private health information would be expected from me, and I have not consented to this condition since my hire.  I do not consent to these conditions now.</p>
<p>&rt;The form for religious exemption requires disclosure of, definition of, and specific details surrounding aspects of my deeply held and very personal and private belief systems to be shared with my employer.  This form also implies that the validity of my belief systems are subject to interpretation or rejection by the university.  I do not consent to share any information about my beliefs, and find it offensive that my employer feels they have the right to ask about such beliefs or judge them to be sincere or worthy enough for exemption.  Additionally, I do not agree with the fact that there is no option for people who hold very profound moral, scientific, or spiritual beliefs outside of recognized organized religions that would prohibit them from taking drugs they are uncomfortable with in order to remain employed or to avoid ostracization from their work or school community.</p>
<p>&rt;While I understand the circumstances here are unprecedented and you are all doing the best you can to help keep the maximum number of people "safe," our liberties and basic human rights still need to be a consideration on the individual level.  My physician has determined that due to my medical circumstances, I am at much greater risk of sudden death or permanent injury than others for receiving this vaccine due to life-threatening clotting in my past.  However, I do not agree with the content of the forms I must submit to gain the medical waiver necessary, despite the validity of my claim and very real consequences I could face for taking this vaccine.  I feel as though I have been backed into a corner and given only a few choices by the university in this situation:</p>
<p>&rt;1.  Consent to have a drug put into my body that could take my life or severely and permanently impact my health against my wishes, or</p>
<p>&rt;2.  Submit personal and private information about my health and/or spiritual practices to my employer against my wishes, or</p>
<p>&rt;3.  Face ostracization from my work community and be given a separate set of rules because of my medical circumstances, or</p>
<p>&rt;4.  Face severe financial hardship with only one week's notice and no time to prepare for alternate employment to support myself and my family.</p>
<p>&rt;As all of these choices are unsatisfactory to me,  I simply say no.  I do not consent to what you are asking of me. Submitting my private health information to keep my job sets a dangerous precedent that I'm unwilling to set. </p>
<p>&rt;This is what I am willing to do:</p>
<p>&rt;Voluntarily submit a letter from my physician stating that, in his professional opinion, it is not best for me to take any covid-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt;Continue to abide by the rules that all other individuals on campus must abide by. </p>
<p>&rt;Manage my own health symptoms and keep others in my community safer by staying home if I become ill, provided I will not be penalized for this.</p>
<p>&rt;This is what I am not willing to do:</p>
<p>&rt;Be segregated or given separate rules from the rest of the community because of a medical condition.  This is discrimination.</p>
<p>&rt;Sign any blanket releases of health information to <em>edited</em> University.</p>
<p>&rt;Provide any information whatsoever to <em>edited</em> University that relates to my health other than the above noted statement from my physician.</p>
<p>&rt;Submit to compulsory testing or release any test results of any medical testing to <em>edited</em> University unless I am compelled by law to report an illness to my employer.</p>
<p>&rt;Provide any information about my religion or spiritual beliefs to anyone at <em>edited</em> University for any reason unless I so choose to do so.</p>
<p>&rt;I would like to make it abundantly clear that I have not resigned from my position, and have no intention to do so.</p>
<p>&rt;I would like to thank you all for doing your best to help our community stay healthy while also helping me to ensure you are providing <em>reasonable</em> accommodations to those of us with documented health concerns and conditions.</p>
<p>&rt;Thank you,
&rt;<em>Edited</em></p>
<p>At this point I received a reply that was about two sentences long. I'm not even going to bother to copy it here, it basically said "I've copied the email address of the manager of the office of equity, I urge you to submit your medical exemption to her." </p>
<p>Here's the good news:</p>
<p>My doctor did in fact fill out my forms in a way that protects my privacy. He listened when I told him my concerns and what the lawyer said he did not have to report, including any diagnoses or anything personal about my health history.  He simply wrote "due to medical history, it is not in <em>patent's</em> best interest to take any Covid-19 vaccines because they could result in serious complication or even death." </p>
<p>I did not sign the blanket release of information. </p>
<p>I informed my supervisor that, as being unvaccinated puts me at the most risk (and not the vaccinated people around me) and I choose to accept those risks, I will no longer be wearing a mask at work. She is allowing it, and no one else who even knows who I am is aware of or can legally ask about my vaccination status. They are not turning me into a pariah that has to wear a badge on my face that says "I'm unvaccinated! Feel free to question and harass me about it!"</p>
<p>I did not lose my job. </p>
<p>While they did not adress any of my concerns personally, they did release a statement on Thursday July 22nd that those who are unvaxxed as of Friday July 23rd (the initial deadline) <em>should still come to work</em> and they'll be contacted about further instructions. This is a tiny backpedal from the initial hard line they took that said "No vaccine and no exemption, no work. No exceptions." I'm counting it as a win, even if it's just a small one. </p>
<p>I wish I had better info for you all, something more positive, but this is the outcome of the stand I made, and I promised you all I would come back when I knew how it came out. If there are any further developments, I'll update again. </p>
<p>I'm proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free. (/s just in case you need it).</p>
<p>Love and light to you all. These are terrifying times we're living in.</p></p>

        <p>All that run around and jumping through hoops over this.  It's not right. I hope I don't have to face this one day.</p>

        <p>Agreed. </p>
<p>Granted, "I don't want to take that drug" should be the only reason anyone needs, ever. But that's not the world we live in, apparently.</p>

        <p>I agree. This is totally their way of handling things, from what I've seen in my time there. They won't address the problems I've presented to them and their only response was a passive aggressive "suggestion" that I submit the forms... but then they released a public statement that everyone should still come to work 😂</p>
<p>Ok cool. I'll do exactly what I said I was going to do then, I'll still come to work. Because I was, in fact, correct that I still have a right to privacy.</p>

        <p>I also work for a college - a community college in upstate NY.  It's part of the SUNY system so we're all government employees.</p>
<p>I'm also on one of the COVID response teams.</p>
<p>I can tell you, from my experience, many of the people coming up with and implementing policy are pissed off and completely over this whole COVID thing, even if they think it's serious and are in favor of the vaccine.  We had a bitch session in our weekly updates meeting last week.</p>
<p>One of our VP's said he's talked with colleagues in the private sector, and a lot of their COVID vaccination plans have blown up in their faces.</p>
<p>Our school nurse is pissed off because a lot of the compliance is falling on her and her team, they have little guidance from the state and she's not a full MD/theologian/lawyer.  In other words, she's not comfortable making 100% of the positions and she does not have staff to handle everything.</p>

        <p>They are getting a lot of push back on employees to the point where lawyers are getting involved.  </p>
<p>For example, there is a legal form, I think it's from the FLCCC, that basically asks the employer a series of questions and statements about the vaccine, and that the employer has to give answers/sign off that they understand.  This list includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Does employer sponsored health care cover injury from the vaccine?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does employer sponsored life insurance cover death from the vaccine?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is employer aware that workman's comp can kick in if employee is injured from vaccine?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is employer aware that a civil suit can be filed if employee is injured from vaccine?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is employer aware that vaccine is under EUA and could be revoked at any time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is employer aware of the differences between EUA and full FDA approval, including all legal differences?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did you give employees information about the vaccine, including potential side effects?  Side effects can include everything from a sore arm to death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What business basis is there for employee to receive a vaccine, especially one under EUA?  Are they dealing with at-risk populations on a regular basis?  Can alternative working arrangements be made? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are other vaccines required to work at particular jobs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is employer aware that since the vaccines are under EUA, the manufacturer is not liable for injury/death?  (I believe the standing under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act is a bit murky as well)</p>

<p>The issue is a lot of companies are short sighted and haven't thought things through.  They probably thought it was a good idea to look woke and it's a selling point to employees and customers that they are a "safe" place.</p>

        <p>P.S.  I'm looking at this as making a deal, you want me to be vaccinated as part of my job, then you're going to be responsible for any fall out.  Keep that in mind in any dealings.  </p>
<p>Personally, I'm working on something similar.  I had a severe reaction to a TDAP vaccine 8 years ago.  Got myocarditis and had to go to hospital for 3 days.  I talked to an immunologist who said it was unlikely to happen for a different vaccine but there is no tests they can run to see if something like this would happen.  I could even be OK if I got another TDAP shot.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand what you're asking. </p>
<p>If you're asking about the students and what will happen if they do not comply, I don't have an answer for that, as much as I wish I did. My situation only applies me as an employee. </p>
<p>The lawyer I spoke with did say that students probably have an easier fight on their hands than the staff, since the university really doesn't want to lose their $60k or so in tuition and other associated costs of attending the school.</p>

<p>The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has just released "technical assistance" reassuring employers that they can go ahead and try to require the vaccine.  It's so interesting how they admit there are exemptions and loopholes (but then don't explain what those may be).  Does anyone know the specifics of the loopholes they are referring to here?</p>
<p>"Federal EEO laws do not prevent an employer from requiring all employees physically entering the workplace to be vaccinated for COVID-19, <strong>so long as employers comply with the reasonable accommodation provisions of the ADA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other EEO considerations.</strong>  Other laws, not in EEOC’s jurisdiction, may place additional restrictions on employers.  From an EEO perspective, employers should keep in mind that because some individuals or demographic groups may face greater barriers to receiving a COVID-19 vaccination than others, some employees may be more likely to be negatively impacted by a vaccination requirement."</p>

        <p>I have not, and don't plan to. Honestly, I feel like I've already risked complete social ostracization simply by speaking up about not wanting to fall into line and get my shot like a "good citizen."  Have you watched mainstream media lately? I'm in Ohio, not one of the southern states where they are a little less covid brainwashed.  Everyone here is 110% pro-vaccine. I mean, my workplace is a vaccine distribution center (and I'm sure that has <em>absolutely nothing</em> to do with their mandate, completely unrelated I'm sure...) </p>
<p>I'm facing pressure from my friends, my family, and everyone at work.  I feel like NO ONE here is on my side.  I'm not saying any of this in a mocking tone, but the media would NOT be sympathetic to this cause, and my university is a HUGE entity in this city. What I did was pretty damn close to pulling a trigger point blank on my career and social life. It is a fight worth fighting to me and I would stand with others who wanted to protest this is my area,  but going to any media here wouldn't be helpful.</p>
