    <strong>Jurisdictions Where Group Gathering Limitations Have Been Tested in Terms of Freedom of Association Combined with Freedom of Expression</strong>
    <p><p>I am wondering if there are any jurisdictions in the “Western” world where a court case or lawyer has specifically raised a freedom of association argument as it pertains to charges related to group gatherings? </p>
<p>In most jurisdictions, there are limits like outdoor gatherings are limited to x number of people taking precautions and if indoor gatherings are even permitted, it is indoor gatherings are limited to some lower y with precautions. Now, it is easier for authorities to define an indoor gathering insofar as people can be in the same room or structure. However,  outside, where many more people are still going about their lives than the gathering limit permits in a particular outdoor area, it becomes legally more difficult. The authorities now have to define outdoor group. </p>
<p>For example, say a group of anti lockdown protesters wanted to test this, they could stand and protest exactly two meters apart with masks and/or conduct a march with clear attempts at realistic distancing for the outdoor space with masks. To be clear, I don’t condone the forced wearing of masks by a state or one of its organs. I think it should be up to the individual. The group would also have to split into cells of 5, 10... or whatever the arbitrary limit is in the jurisdiction for outdoor gatherings. If the authorities try to use an outdoor gathering restriction charge to issue a fine, a single cell of protesters could reasonably argue that they are not the same as the other groups and that they as a cell are following the rules to the letter. The authorities will try and press them for why several groups are expressing the same grievance, the same day and at the same place. At that point the freedom of association and expression arguments can kick in and if a cell is fined under such charges a test case forcing the court to specifically define outdoor group can occur and a rights-based argument akin to the one I articulated can be brought forward.</p>
<p>I’d like to know what people think. I realize this form of organization for protests has its advantages and disadvantages in practical and idea marketing terms, particularly in cities.</p></p>
