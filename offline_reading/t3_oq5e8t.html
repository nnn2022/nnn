    <strong>ELI5: EU citizens with US residency can freely travel back home to visit friends and family, but US citizens are not allowed to travel to those same places. Why?</strong>
    <p><p>European friend lives in USA for the past few years and is married, but not yet a citizen. Was in the USA before corona hit and all through it, but is somehow not a "carrier" and poses no threat and is allowed to travel back to Europe to vacation with friends and then come back to USA. She is also unvaxxed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, US citizens (non-EU citizens) are not allowed to go visit friends, family, fiance, etc. in Europe, because of restrictions due to the 'virus'. </p>
<p>I would think the rules would be consistent. She and I were both in the same place though the 'pandemic', so if there's any health risk associated with allowing people to enter Europe, then she would be just as dangerous as I am, but she gets to float back and forth and I've seen other people online, some Norwegian contact of mine who is married and living in Canada, just gets to hop across the ocean whenever, not for work or anything. </p>
<p>So, how exactly does having citizenship from some far away country change the fact that we're both sitting here in the same place and thus should be just as much of a danger to carry our germs across the sea as the other?</p></p>

        <p>Trying to process logically the guidelines based on medical considerations is a waste of time.  It's fairly evident that the true aim of this is global scale politics.</p>

        <p>It's just because of her citizenship, her home country can't stop her entering, so that gets her "into" Europe, and her residency can get her back into USA.</p>
<p>I, for example, am a UK citizen living in Norway, so UK can't stop me entering as I am still a citizen of UK and I have a residency in Norway which allows me entry into Norway. So effectively neither entry restrictions of those two countries can stop me from entering.</p>

        <p>I know that. But if people are such a health hazard then they should not be able to visit and go back and forth as they wish based on citizenship and such. If Americans are so polluted with the virus that we're not allowed in to other places then anyone living here is a danger, regardless of citizenship status.</p>
