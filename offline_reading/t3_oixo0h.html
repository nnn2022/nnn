    <strong>A subreddit to expose the ways in which people has medical tyranny and authoritarianism</strong>
    <p><p>I would love to see a subreddit that consists of screen shots and criticisms of other reddit interactions, where people are advocating for loss of rights, freedoms, violence etc.</p>
<p>I just think having a resource compiled of all the ‘virtue signalling’ and how it enables government to become bigger and worse, would be very useful.</p>
<p>There was a post here that recently did something, and because there was that exposure, the individual <em>corrected their speech and behaviour.</em></p>
<p>This is such a huge win. More of this needs to happen.</p></p>
