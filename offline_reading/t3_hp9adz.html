        <p>Mate, I know, it just gets worse.</p>
<p>I guess this is a drive to get the economy going, they know they’ve done too good a job at scaring everyone into staying in their homes so now they are coaxing them out by saying “look, it’s okay, mask theatre to keep you safe”.  The masks aren’t about health, they are about getting people out spending money again. </p>
<p>I’m hoping this is just a “if you don’t be good, well close the beaches again” type empty threat but...</p>

        <p>Yea, I agree with this, exactly what I was going to say.  They can't come out  and just say 'look, we made a big mistake, crashed the economy for nothing, covid is a mild virus that is harmless to most people, so please can you all go back to work now because our economy is fucked' because the backlash would be incredible.  So instead they have to allow people a way to pretend that the virus is actually deadly.  Masks are the answer to that, a visible sign that we are taking this threat very, very seriously and you should still be scared, but not if you wear this flimsy piece of cloth over your mouth.  In the picture in the article, only Boris is wearing a mask though, the cashiers and the other customer behind him aren't!</p>
<p>To be honest, I've not worn a mask (and won't) this entire time, have used public transport often and nobody has said a word to me yet.  So I'll continue to ignore it - if it is like you and I think, they won't actually 'enforce' these policies, because they know they are only theatre anyway.  It's still dystopian as fuck and enables the continuation of this mass hysteria of course, and I am absolutely against mandating masks by law.</p>

        <p>So we have to keep living in this hell all because media and politicians will never admit they were so horribly wrong about everything? Really? That's truly no way to live. Keeping up a charade of a level 5 pandemic just so they can save face is disgusting on all levels. Just like they flipped the switch and programmed these idiots to be afraid of a 0.2% IFR virus back in March, they can flip the switch again and re-program them. This whole thing has shown how easily the masses can be programmed and how most people will just readily accept all bullshit no matter how absurd it is and practically beg for more.</p>

        <p>This is far more sinister than politicians saving face. They often hide behind this veil of incompetence but it's all part of the mind control. People begin to demand more rules and feel that they're all smarter than the government puppets. Same thing happened with Brexit, a messy Brexit meant no accountability.</p>

        <p>They all seem to do this, allow you to go out without it with reopening, then within a few weeks mandate it. I wonder what the strategy if anything behind it is or if it's just coincidence.</p>

        <p>Flu is less infectious and less deadly, and either way people are aware about flu and don't go out often anyway. Flu season is in about fall or winter, where people wouldn't go outside so much. Flu is only serious to those with respiratory illnesses, who are advised to stay home anyway, so Flu only acts as a bad cold and boom it leaves. Covid 19 however is fatal <em>1%</em> of the time and as it's way more infectious than the flu anyway a lot of people will get it and if one thousand people get it <em>10</em> people will die. It would be terrible and take a toll on humanity. In the Black Plague, a third of Europe died! And bubonic plague isn't as infectious as Covid 19. I'm not saying covid 19 is the next black plague, but it'll turn into it if stubborn pieces of shit like you and all you rednecks don't stay the fuck home. People listened in other countries; in Norway the deaths are counted in single digits. But in America, brainwashed with a desire to be free and due to 1970 and 1980 propaganda thought that helping others wasn't being free. Free speech is cool and all, but Jesus fuck if this is what your going to do with it I'd rather live in a dictatorship</p>

        <p>everything about this comment is wrong.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>People go out during flu season in fact the reason it is flu season is people are congested inside office buildings stores rather than spread out like in summer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COVID is only serious for people over 65 and those with pre-existing health conditions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>COVID is not fatal 1% of the time its more like 0.26% </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is not even close to the plague. The fact that you compared it to that gives you zero credibility</p>

        <p>You are literally arguing with a shill getting paid to do it and most possibly a bot... Look at his posting history, he's massive pro lockdown pro mask anti trump and posts on the most random things of all time in between...</p>
<p>Covid has an IFR of 0.05 % under 70, 0.26 % if you count the 86 year olds with terminal cancer that caught covid and died. Influenza flu consistently hovers around 0.10 %, but if you have terminal cancer and the flu, your cause of death is terminal cancer... With covid tho, it gets listed as cause of death everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Covid is basically a joke unless you're dying already. </p>
