    <strong>Has anyone noticed that they lack empathy for those who’ve been hurt?</strong>
    <p><p>So.. has anyone else noticed that the people who believe in this vaccine aren’t empathetic towards people who have been disabled and injured by the vaccine?</p>
<p>Does anyone notice how these those who have been injured are gaslighted into omission? If anyone talks about their adverse reactions to the vaccine they’re demonized &amp; ostracized.</p>
<p>What’s up with that? I thought they “cared” about others?</p></p>

        <p>The only thing they care about is power. This is a symptom of identity politics. They believe if they cheer lead for a group that somehow gives them power but they are still the same useless frightened cowards they have always been.</p>

        <p>Yes - I am seeing an extreme lack of empathy and solidarity in vaccinated people towards groups who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>unvaccinated, </li>
<li>unable to get vaccinated, </li>
<li>have not received immunity, </li>
<li>have suffered from adverse health effects after getting it </li>
<li>are denied essential services due to not having a vaccine passport. </li>
</ul>
<p>The reaction is "too bad", "I got it and I was fine", "it's not my problem", accompanied by a wish to force the vaccine on everyone, and to harm/hurt/punish those who have not had it yet. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this violent behaviour is proof that these people have been victims of coercion themselves and this is the circle of violence presenting itself. The behavioural pattern can be likened to children who have been abused by caregivers - they will start hitting other children, being cruel to animals, insult and belittle those who cannot defend themselves, growing up to later say "my parents hit me and I turned out fine". They will even advocate child abuse, saying it's necessary to raise a "good child". </p>
<p>In the case of COVID, the government has acted violently towards them by taking away the right to their body - they are unable to justify why this needed to happen to them. The only way to cope with this unfair reality is by making it a reality for everyone else, too.</p>

        <p>Yeah it's sad because it stems from a fragile ego and desire to virtue single , while also blatantly ignoring data , and science oh yeah that , that says this was not the way to handle this . Unfourntaley the modern media engulfed individual is incapable of admitting they're wrong , and I assume it's also a bit frightening to acknowledge that there "guy" has always been a corporate shill....</p>

        <p>It’s very obvious and hypocritical.  And there are also people who have made it their sole mission to bully and m gaslight people into submission on this platform and others.  I wonder how they have time or energy to do that.  Are they paid by Big Pharma?  That’s what I want to know.</p>

        <p>I've noticed it by their abject lies of omission by completely ignoring that serious side effects of every covid vax exists.  What is it about these people that the vaccines are reacting to?  are they investigating?  is it an underlying condition that they are reacting with?  is it because they're mammals?</p>
