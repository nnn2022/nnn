    <strong>Is there any point planning for the future right now?</strong>
    <p><p>Pre-covid I had so many plans. Places I wanted to visit. Things I wanted to do. </p>
<p>Now it feels like we are entering a time where those who are unvaccinated maybe refused any sort of travel or social life etc.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming to know exactly what's going to happen or what's going on behind the scenes. All I know is we have been and continue to be lied to. They are scaring the majority into submitting to their crazy rules and quite frankly I'm sick of it. </p>
<p>My fear is that life as we knew it is gone forever, and this covid/vaccine situation is going to be an on going one. Our freedoms will be taken away piece by piece and we will be left with nothing. Even our sense of community has been chipped away piece by piece because people have been divided by their opinions/religious beliefs ect. </p>
<p>I am scared of what the future holds. Luckily I don't plan on having children, so at least that makes it less complicated in my case. I just wanna feel human again. </p>
<p>Are we heading for a war? How do you think this will pan out?</p></p>

        <p>I hate to be a reverse doomer but the future looks bleak imo. I used to have lots of plans and felt a lot of excitement pretty much everyday. Now I don’t really give a shit about anything anymore. I’ve stopped using social media altogether and started using Reddit (only for NNN) after this whole Covid bs started. </p>
<p>It’s easy to say “just continue your normal life, don’t give up!” but the truth is that they are changing the world bit by bit and there’s nothing we can do to stop it. I can’t pretend life is normal when everything around me isn’t. It doesn’t matter if your country/state is slowly getting back to the old normal (lifting mask mandates etc) - it’s all just an illusion. Pre-Covid times will never come back. I know this for a fact. </p>
<p>I might just start living in the woods with my boyfriend and eat wild berries while the world burns down</p>

        <p>I was planning on moving to Europe in the next few years, but at this point, anywhere in Europe looks like a far worse option than finding an open red state, and at least a move to one of those is relatively easy. Maybe things will actually turn out okay, but I would hesitate to make any long-term plans in the immediate future.</p>

        <p>Well, you won’t hear anything on the news but tensions are getting very high with China. And more recently, Ukraine and Russia. It looks like a possible war could break out. Especially with Biden back tracking on all the peace agreements Trump made. I’m not a big fan of Trump but I respect him for doing that.</p>
<p>As for a future, it looks pretty bleak, especially outside the US where it seems every country is hyper pro lockdown and covid shit. Thankfully I’m done with school before all this bullshit but now I’m lost on what to do because the world is basically closed. I did have a basic plan but that’s gone now. At this point I’m just hoping we don’t end up in a nuclear holocaust.</p>

        <p>Can't get a gun. I live in the UK :(</p>
<p>If they start pushing harder here, people like me are stuffed. At least in the US you guys have opportunities to defend yourselves in the event of an emergency. </p>
<p>We can't even harm a burglar when they break into our homes without risking a prison sentence lmfao! That's mad ain't it?!</p>

        <p>Yes. My mind has been turning more toward religion as of late. I'm not sure exactly what I believe. The world is full of lies so it wouldn't surprise me if religion has been corrupted also. I think the not really knowing what's real and what's not is the most aggravating thing. The only thing I know for sure is there are some seriously evil people controling everything at the moment.</p>

        <p>You're on the right track.  I literally just trust in Jesus to guide me through all this mess, and be my savior when my time on earth is done.  It gives me joy and hope in each day despite what's going on in the world.  I rarely talk like this and I'm not a pastor but I believe what I say.  Believing in Jesus and getting saved is the first step.</p>
<p>Organized religion is pretty contaminated and controlled, just like politics and the medical field and media.  Some of it is true, but the evil people try to infiltrate anything.  The more you know God's word, the more you can see through the mess.  The lies mimic truth at times, or seem like nice things, but hey that's how lies are.</p>
<p>That being said, I believe the Bible to be true, the New King James Version is a good translation to start with.  If you want to reach out or whatever, feel free to.  We're sort of alone but we have others in this too.</p>
