<p>Pushing drugs to the public is the objective. Plus when something works needs no enforcement. I don't see the gov enforcing drinking water for instance. But they do enforce drugs. That tells me something.</p>

        <p>By enforcement I assume you mean forcing the consumption of said water? Because the drinking water supply and system itself is probably one of the most enforced and regulated areas of the country.</p>

        <p>Yes I was talking about forcing water intake which after all it's significance is beyond doubt. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;  water supply and system itself is probably  one of the most enforced and regulated areas of the country. </p>
<p>No it's not. In fact as a resident you should have the right to disconnect the water supply to your house and stop paying the water bill. So not it's not that enforced. Now compare that with the medical system which you are forced to pay, or it is automatically deducted from your salary (if you are an employee). A huge difference  in choice don't you agree?</p>

        <p>Not really? Utilities aren't a legal obligation. Your water will be shut off if you don't pay the bill. You won't have police coming to your house guns drawn forcing you to pay the bill to restore access.</p>
<p>Unless you have access to a body of water (that you have to boil and filter to even use) or a personal well, there is no reason to shut off the water anyway. I've never heard of people with wells being forced to accept a connection to city water anyway. If you have access to your own water you aren't obligated to pay for city water. A dwelling is legally and functionally uninhabitable without access to clean water.</p>

        <p>Right that's what I meant, in terms of choice you want municipality water vs the medical system. You have a choice with water you don't have a choice with the drug-care. They force you to pay for it whether you use it or not.</p>

<p>You don't need to be an oncologist to see that the one of the most "benevolent" consequences of this approach will be a huge spike in various types of cancers over the coming years and decades.</p>
<p>Provided what we're told is correct and cancer is in fact, the result of cell growth to the point where it becomes dangerous to the body, I mean.</p>

        <p>Microchips intended for implantation in humans are getting <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2018/05/31/microchips-are-getting-under-the-skin-of-thousands-in-sweden">smaller and smaller</a>.

<p>Nor is it unthinkable that governments use invasive methods of pacification like getting an entire population to take a substance <a href="https://theconversation.com/morality-pills-may-be-the-uss-best-shot-at-ending-the-coronavirus-pandemic-according-to-one-ethicist-142601">against their will</a>.</p>

        <p>No, it's really not. It's a typical coronavirus, which is already highly contagious, but then its hosts fought back with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as isolation, physical distancing, and face covering. The virus adapted to the new hostile conditions by becoming more contagious. </p>
<p>What truly is different here is the response by some governments. It's one thing to dictate that "all residents will be vaccinated against smallpox, and those who refuse will be fined," and quite another to say, "all residents will be vaccinated against a cold virus, and those that refuse will be restrained and forced to accept the injection."</p>

        <p>The morality rate of the virus is &lt; 0.5% for anyone under 50. It's significantly lower if you excluse those who already have health issues.</p>
<p>Even if it were more  contagious than any other virus out there, which is very unlikely, the tiny morality rate still wouldn't justify the draconian measures being push in the name of this virus...</p>

<p>Putting people over 70 at risk when you can avoid it just because they have only 20 to 30 years to live at best isn't exactly a strategy most people would be willing to accept.</p>
<p>Why not just put people over 70 under quarantaine, impose somewhat lesser measures for people between 50 and 70 and let everyone else go on with their lives as usual?</p>
<p>That way, you should be able to protect the most vulnerable parts of the population without putting entire countries under what is basically the medical equivalent of martial law, and destroy countless businesses &amp; jobs in the process.</p>
<p>But hey... we all know that this virus isn't the real reason for these measures, now, isn't it?</p>

        <p>I think we’re saying largely the same thing?</p>
<p>I’m not really for age-stratified restrictions, they’re a step in the right direction. However, I think people should be made aware (accurately, not fearmongering) of their risks and how they can mitigate them, then left to their own freedom to choose what they do. That is what life is about after all. </p>
<p>I don’t think the countries should have shut down. Maybe cancel large gatherings (e.g. festivals and clubs). I would sorely miss them, sure it is far easier and more beneficial to the economy to subsidise only a specific sector..</p>
<p>P.S I will say, 20 - 30 years left at 70 is quite wishful. 10, maybe 15 is more accurate.</p>

<p>I've quite a few octogenarians &amp;  nonagenarians. So I'd say that living 20 years past the age of 70 isn't really that uncommon. </p>
<p>30? Sure. That's where the "at best" comes in...</p>

        <p>The old "So you don't care about old people, you prick" argument, eh? How very unoriginal and utterly predictable.</p>
<p>If the only people really at risk are people over 50 and people with certain existing health risks, then you can just focus on isolating these people from the rest of the population and let the rest of the population go on with their normal lives as much as humanly possible.</p>

        <p>&rt; I usually believe what the overwhelming amount of doctors and scientists tell me though.</p>
<p>That would be "the overwhelming majority," not the overwhelming amount. You aren't a very well educated person, are you?</p>
<p>No, the overwhelming majority of doctors and scientists haven't been telling you any such thing. That's just a false claim that news people love to pass along, because panic and sensationalism have been boosting their ratings, and which activists love to parrot, because that lie lets them go on with their pretense of being brave resistance fighters against tyranny, instead of what they really are: the grunts fighting to establish tyranny.</p>
<p>Seriously - people have died from what would have been easily treatable medical condition because willfully ignorant governor-turned-dictators forced the hospitals to deny them medical treatment. Wondering how many of those deaths got counted as Covid deaths, because the unreliable test for infection turned up some positive results.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Normally, there's a bit of advice I give to people who've fallen for this BS: Go find some physicians (or "doctors," if you prefer) and scientists that you know in real life (as in, not the Internet), and ask them what they think about all of this. I'm a PhD candidate in a real STEM subject, and there are a number of physicians in my immediate family, so I know what you're going to hear, and it's not going to be a lot of support for what has been going on. Also, I live in Chicago, one of the bluest cities in America, so before anybody starts talking about the right wing echo chamber I'm living in, let's be serious.</p>
<p>But as for you, u/blarghable? I don't know. I can't picture you knowing any scientists or physicians. Our immediate gut reaction, when somebody like you (low IQ and hyper-aggressive) approaches is to either call security or flee. Probably a wise choice in either case. An old girlfriend once suggested to me that full communication is impossible in the case of an IQ gap of more than 50 points (and this seems to be right). When people like me try to talk to people like you, all that happens is that people like you don't get it, and then you start getting angry. Then you turn violent. Not a good time.</p>
<p>So, I don't know what to tell you, buddy.</p>

        <p><strong>I just downvoted your comment.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;FAQ What does this mean?</p>
<p><strong>The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Why did you do this?</p>
<p><strong>There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rudeness towards other Redditors, Spreading incorrect information, Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Am I banned from the Reddit?</p>
<p><strong>No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?</p>
<p><strong>Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</p>
<p><strong>Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.</strong></p>

        <p>I understand the fact that you're a condescending man-child. My desire to not have so much money that I would need bodyguards, out of a realistic concern that I (or one of my family members) might be kidnapped and held for highly profitable ransom, is hardly an unusual one. Nor an unreasonable one to act on. To live simply is not such a terrible thing. </p>

        <p>\^ This delightful fellow (who I'm about to block) has been following me around on Reddit. I think he's in love with me.</p>
<p>Kind of creepy, but what can one do? Guess he likes them young.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How very interesting that a statement on my part that I wouldn't go for extreme greed at the cost of my own quality of life would get downvoted. Wondering if that should tell me something about the site.</p>

        <p><strong>Projecting much, aren't you?
I’m sorry if you took my opinion as an insult, I was merely describing your self-image and as no one can force another person to be right there is also no problem if you don’t agree with me. I just envy everyone you have never met and I can’t stop wondering how you obviously lack common sense given how common it is. Well, I guess you don’t like my honesty, but neither do I like your lies and moreover I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain this any further to you. Bye.</strong></p>

        <p>Wait a minute, wait, so they weren't even gonna make it kinda sorta technically-speaking "voluntary" -- they'd just straight up hog tie you down, penetrate your body, and squirt their fluid inside of you?
