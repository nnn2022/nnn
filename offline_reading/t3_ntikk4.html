        <p>We can’t do that, though.  People here know.  A LOT of people don’t.  Lot of people need convincing of the shiftiness that is so prevalent in the upper echelons.  </p>

        <p>Nope. Fauci plainly stated that masks don't work, that asymptomatics don't spread it. Then went on TV and lied about it because the democrats wanted to crash the economy. It's really kind of sick to watch you respond trying to cover for a mass murderer. I bet you keep a few keepsakes from Adolf and the boys stashed around your house, you sick fuck.</p>

        <p>There’s a video of him in an interview saying “all they might do is make you feel a bit better” I have it saved somewhere. But I don’t know about you, but I don’t need to wear a mask for a false sense of security lol. Him going on tv in another interview telling people wearing two masks would be a good idea is him going on tv and lying based on his other comment. I think in the first interview he also says asymptomatic spread has never been a driving factor for respiratory viruses. Search those terms on DuckDuckGo not google because they censor. Unfortunately you’ve been led astray when it comes to the reality of the situation that’s destroyed billions of lives.</p>

        <p>Yes, I have seen that interview. If you watch the whole thing you will see that there is more context to what he said. Notice before your clip he talks about how masks are important, and after your clip he repeats that masks are needed for the sick.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/PRa6t_e7dgI</p>
<p>Also this was the top result of Google. Not sure why you think Google is censoring this, but you show why it's important to source your claims, becuaee people like you wanna spin his comments as some form of gotcha.</p>

        <p>I know where masks are important and it’s in a healthcare setting only. Other than that sick people should be at home not out wearing a mask around town. They aren’t “needed” for the sick. Sick people need treatment or time to recuperate. As a physician he should know that, I know that as a HCW. So the fact that he doesn’t specify these things in the rest of the interview speaks for itself.... it doesn’t make him look competent in any way. I have watched the entire thing, you simply asked for where he said what he said. Either he is not giving people the information they should know because he doesn’t know or because there’s a malevolent reason. Either way there’s an issue and that’s the point you seem to have missed here.</p>

<p>Fauci said the exact opposite. So you are now saying that Fauci DIDNT say what you originally claimed? Why did you lie about what he said then?</p>

        <p>He failed to specify that this is only true in a healthcare setting so unless that’s what he meant he is incompetent or lied to everyone. Judging by all the information we have about him by now, it’s both. Not sure why you’re working so hard to defend someone like this... lol. If you think masks are awesome and useful in society there’s lots of other subreddits to choose from that will support this delusion.</p>

        <p>Buddy, the only one that lied here is you. You got caught lying about what Fauci said. You have now changed you stance from "He said they were worthless" to "he said that sick people need to wear them". You are moving the goalposts and now getting upset by the fact that I showed you that you were wrong.</p>
<p>You are a casestudy in why sources are important. Also I'm not going to leave your safe space just because you are upset. Sorry/not sorry.</p>

        <p>You’re defending someone who’s been exposed time and time again as a fraud. Not to mention he’s been exposed as someone who couldn’t care less about the health of people like you and I. Like wow, he said that sick people need to wear masks even though that’s the least helpful thing for them, congrats, bravo! Lol. Not sure what that adds to this discussion. The only pandemic now is the rampant mental illness which you are an example of.</p>

<p>I linked to a longer version of that video showing how your comment about it was wrong and out of context. Did you not even watch my video? It was <strong><em>literally</em></strong> the same part of the interview, just with a minute more of him explaining. </p>
<p>You lied about what he said and then throw a fit when I proved you wrong. </p>
<p>Also he did say that "RIGHT NOW people don't need to wear masks. That recommendation changed when he got more evidence about asymptomatic  spread. He was completely open about that the reasoning for the new recommendation was in line with his previous comments in that the mask WORKS at catching droplets for the infected.</p>
<p>None of this was countered by what his emails said. So again: you are lying and getting upset about how it's been proven that you lied.</p>
<p>Also my common sense is paraphrasing Einstein, so I'm not suprised that you are also calling one of the smartest scientists ever "ignorant" lol.</p>

        <p>You’re nitpicking over irrelevant things because you quite clearly have no evidence or argument that would show that Fauci <em>IS</em> a credible public official. No one asks for evidence of that because there isn’t any. You think you did something here when you didn’t. </p>
<p>It’s also comical that you bring up the moving of goalposts. Self-awareness is very lacking. </p>
<p>Call it a safe space if you want, but it’s really just a place normal people go to get away from the constant craziness that people like you are obsessed with carrying on in spite of piles of contradicting evidence. How you think beating a dead horse is helpful to yourself or anyone else is beyond me.</p>

        <p>&rt;You’re nitpicking</p>
<p>Accurately showing what Fauci literally said is not nitpicking. That poster made a claim and it was wrong. If you care about actual facts then you shouldn't have an issue with that.</p>
<p>&rt;It’s also comical that you bring up the moving of goalposts</p>
<p>Cite me moving the goal posts ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p>
<p>&rt;Call it a safe space if you want, but it’s really just a place normal people go.... </p>
<p>People in a cult always think that they are the normal and rational ones becuase they flee to echo chambers were they can wear the things that they want to hear with minimal challenge.</p>

        <p>You’re defending some random dude who would probably drive over your body in his car if you were laying in the street and you think THIS is the cult? Good thing I wasn’t taking a sip of my beer during that one. You are aware that everything people in this sub represent is simply life pre-2020 which you were happily living until globalists went on tv and told you to freak out right....? </p>
<p>You’ve adopted an asinine new way of life that you would have never participated in had you not been so weak. People in positions of authority convinced you you were ineffective at making choices for yourself and that they should make decisions on your behalf and forced all of this garbage down your throats. That’s the definition of cult vibes. Nobody tells me what to do except for me so this is a cult of one over here, sorry to tell you. </p>
<p>The only reason you have a continued dialogue in this sub is because we don’t ban other people like the subs that bred you do. Thanks for the laugh. I would tell you to re-evaluate yourself and your beliefs but I think we all know you’re an insufferable troll.</p>

        <p>You literally are so crazied that you think Fuaci would drive over your body. This is how far down that cult hole you have gone that you NEED to believe that someone that you just disagree with is so evil.</p>

<p>So, that means Fauci's credibility isn't shot?</p>
