        <p>We didn't yell at each other in real life, but we had an argument and clearly people are more worried about the COVID19 itself than young people's mental health and education. People are afraid of dying. "Don't do X and Y for that's unwise" and "Have you remembered wearing your mask?" are phrases I hear a lot nowadays. My fams and social circle went from liberal asf to COVID19 phobic. It's weird to think of when I was a kid I could do whatever I wanted to, but now that I'm in college people won't mind their own business.</p>
<p>Their biggest fear are getting killed by an asymptotic person. Now we knows the virus isn't as dangerous as first believed.</p>
