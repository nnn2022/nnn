    <strong>The doomers are doomed.</strong>
    <p><p>The doomers are at their wits-end. Take a gander at your local region's sub if you live in a place that's currently locked down. There's a shakey optimism as vaccine numbers increase. Total strangers rejoice and gaggle back and fourth about jab dates. Earlier this year their government and media began insinuating that getting jabbed was their ticket to freedom. Now they're outright saying it. They're so relieved a path to normal has been rigidly defined. At this point they feel a week or so of potential headaches, fevers, or chills are "totally worth it." Their desperation has never been higher.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However. I think anyone that's been active on this sub knows it's a lie. This realization comes not from cynicism, but of historical fact. Many of us were fooled in the first few months by the lie that as long as we didn't visit granny and put our masks on the virus would fizzle out. Of course this flipflopped around constantly and became about two weeks to flatten the curve. After it was all said and done more waves happened anyways. We all woke up at some point and realized on our own that at best the government had no idea what they were doing, or at worst were deliberately carrying out an agenda to enslave us by instituting a medical tyranny. This is what the doomers do not and probably will never understand. Governments play power/word games to give the perception of competence, as if following a singular narrative for +12 months was a sign of strength and not of ignorance.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And thus the doomers are doomed. They're currently experiencing a wave of happiness every time the vaccination percentage goes up a point. They believe when enough people get vaccinated all the lockdowns will lift and we will simply go on living our lives. Until the quadruple-UltraGigga strain covid-500 starts being reported in the press this fall in preparation for the 4th wave. People like us will then be blamed even harder. To the doomers and government, the lockdowns could never possibly be the problem, it has to be those dangerous "right wing freedumb covidiots" that are to blame.</p></p>

        <p>Living a life in fear is a life not lived, whatever the story. Fear makes you think irrationally. They know that. God knows that. He tried to warn us against it.</p>
<p>2 Timothy 1:7</p>
<p>For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>

        <p>l saw through this bullshit from the beginning.Even if this was a serious virus it was not gonna be eradicated by using security theater. And at most if l really wanted to protect grandma l would have met her outside and kept 2 feet of distance.</p>

        <p>This pandemic made freedom dangerous. Now it can be attacked.</p>
<p>Violence is coming because I will NOT hand my progeny a communist medical tyranny for a country. At least, not without dying.</p>
<p>Are the doomers as committed to their cause? They have no idea of the character and resolve of people like us. I'M NOT SCARED TO DIE. Not from the virus and certainly not for the defense of humanity in general. They are barking up the wrong tree.</p>
