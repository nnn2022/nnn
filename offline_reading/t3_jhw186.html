    <strong>Tip: Go to the countryside. People are less crazy about covid there.</strong>
    <p><p>So my country recently imposed mandatory masks everywhere outside your home or private vehicle.  It's a 500 euro fine if you're caught not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>Whenever I go to the countryside I see people ignoring these rules all the time, with a carefree and reassuring attitude that I'm jealous of. Either they feel they're more safe from covid cause there's less people, or the people who seek to escape to the countryside are already quite skeptical of covid and are not germaphobes. I have noticed this strange thing about germaphobes. They tend to be more terrified of natural sources of germs like soil and grass over sources like car exhaust and sewage.</p>
<p>Go to the countryside anyway because it's good for your mental health.</p></p>

        <p>1000%. You can tell that the vast majority of the doomers and Mask Nazis are from cities. They see or hear of someone who doesn't have a mask glued to their face 24/7 and lose their shit - acting like it's some sort of alien they're seeing.</p>
<p>In reality, no one gives a fuck about this virus in rural America, but all the doomers and Mask Nazis are too busy in their echo chambers to realize it.</p>

        <p>Most redditors are naive, parent-funded millennials and zoomers who overpay for crappy apartments in coastal-state cities.  They move to the city because there's "more for young people to do" there, and then proceed to shut themselves in their rooms 24/7 doing nothing except playing Xbox, shitposting on /r/politics, and whining about their neighbors being too noisy.  But they think that their living situation gives them superior intelligence and morality- because in their minds, the entire country outside of whatever mismanaged, overcrowded liberal shithole they live in, is nothing but toothless, inbred meth-head rednecks who live in off-grid trailer parks, have the intelligence of a second grader, and shoot other human beings for sport.</p>

        <p>Then maybe something is wrong with our education system.</p>
<p>Also.. you're wrong in your assessment.  There are more college educated people closer to cities in sheer numbers, but the ratio of educated to uneducated is roughly the same.</p>
<p>People in rural areas live there because they don't want to put up with your shit.</p>

        <p>People in rural areas realize that it is a matter of <em>personal responsibility.</em></p>
<p>If I get it, I get it.  I'm not going to blame anyone.  I know the risks and I'm not going to expect the rest of the world to stay inside with masks on their face to keep me from becoming ill.</p>
<p>That's not their responsibility.  It's mine.</p>
<p>That is the correct mentality to have about EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>If they want to voluntarily wear a mask and stay in their house to keep from spreading it, fine.</p>
<p>But expecting and mandating that?  Bullshit.</p>
<p>I don't care if your 92 year old grandmother has heart and lung problems.  That's not my problem.  It sucks for her and I wouldn't wish that on anyone, but it's not my fault and it's not my obligation to look after her.</p>
<p>If people think that makes me an asshole I don't give a shit.  </p>
<p>They don't have to give a damn about me either.</p>

        <p>I wish I still lived in a more rural area instead of being stuck in a city for college. Every time I go back home it's so much better. People still shake your hand, talk to you, actually act like human beings. </p>
<p>Definitely going back to a small town after college. This city shit just ain't it.</p>

        <p>Can confirm. I live in a rural town and since day one, it hasn’t really felt like a pandemic. Our businesses did have to close during the mandatory lockdowns at the beginning, but you still saw people out and about, very few masks.</p>
<p>Everything is back open again. There are plastic shields up at check out counters but very few people wearing masks anywhere. </p>
<p>Honestly, I think small town living has been my saving grace through this whole mess.</p>
