    <strong>Hypocrites</strong>
    <p><p>(Re-posted for flair. Also I will work on adding sources after work)</p>
<p>These fucks were the same people walking around and spreading the flu, cold,  mono, strep etc. not too long ago, coming into work sick, working out  sick, doing groceries and going out in public living their lives, NOT  washing their hands nor hand-sanitizing while sick. Bonus points if they  blew their nose before shaking your hand or coughed/sneezed  openly/incorrectly.</p>
<p>DON'T PRETEND THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN, WE ALL KNOW IT DID</p>
<p>Remember  that shit? Where was the fucking finger-pointing then??? People still die from the flu and will continue to do so, IT'S A PART OF LIFE</p>
<p>Furthermore,</p>
<ul>
<li>NO ONE SEEMED TO GIVE A FUCK ABOUT OTHERS' HEALTH THEN</li>
<li>NO ONE DEMANDED LOCKDOWNS, SOCIAL DISTANCING, MASKS, OR VACCINE PASSPORTS THEN</li>
<li>NO ONE ASKED EVERYONE THEY KNEW IF THEY HAD GOTTEN THEIR FLU SHOT TO "PROTECT" FROM THE FLU THEN</li>
<li>NO ONE LIVED IN FEAR THEN</li>
</ul>
<p>And  NOW you call US "murderers"? That you couldn't care if the unvaccinated  die? WHEN YOU HAVE THE SAME GODDAMN ABILITY TO SPREAD IT? As if you  WEREN'T killing grandma and people with comorbidities with the  latest flu strain you caught in 2019 as well? Motherfucking vain virtue-signalling hypocrites forgot how to think critically, they value perceived safety and self-image over the freedom of choice and ABILITY to consent. What happened to "my body my choice"? <strong>WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU NOW?</strong></p>
<p>No long-term studies. 99.7% survival rate. VAERs reports keep coming in but there is no halting and evaluating and re-adjusting the components in the vaccine to make it SAFE FOR USAGE. Like, you know, the rigorous testing ALL OTHER VACCINES HAD TO UNDERGO. Just the government downright forcing you to get it if you want to do virtually anything (dependent on country) and McDonald's of all fucking companies pushing you to get it.</p>
<p>No actual information on the vaccine itself. Remember Robert Malone? Matt Hancock? Only lies, fear porn, outright government hypocrisy RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, inability to sue for adverse effects, social media and $68 trillion swept right under your feet. There is no human decency anymore if you can't respect other people's ability to make a DECISION for THEMSELVES and CONSENT. That is what we have HISTORICALLY FOUGHT FOR THE ABILITY TO DO. WHY ARE YOU  WILLINGLY UNDOING IT?</p>
<p>It's like there's been a literal on and off switch between 2019 and 2020. "2 minutes hate" if you will. All these conditions existed BEFORE the news talked about it the way they are now. And people weren't fear-mongering then. People weren't divided and turning against co-workers, friends, and families then. People were willing to have a conversation and actually reason WITH others on some level.</p>
<p>PEOPLE WEREN'T PASSIVELY WISHING DEATH UPON PEOPLE FOR QUESTIONING A RUSHED (ONLY SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ARE CURRENTLY KNOWN) IRREVERSIBLE DECISION THAT ALSO HAPPENED TO DIFFER FROM THEIRS, THEN. DON'T VOUCH THAT YOU'RE SAVING LIVES WHILE WISHING DEATH UPON OTHERS. THAT'S CALLED A DOUBLE STANDARD.</p>
<p>The healthcare system in a number of places in the US and countries that have remained open are not overburdened anymore. The curve has FLATTENED in a lot of the states/areas you CRITICIZE. The Delta variant is less deadly but more infectious as per "science".</p>
<p>Yet look no further to AUSTRALIA, where they pepper-sprayed and arrested a 12 year-old girl for not wearing a mask. France. The UK. Japan. South Korea. India. Canada.</p>
<p>HOW MANY MORE FREEDOMS AND RIGHTS HAVE TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND RESTRICTIONS/MANDATES/LOOPHOLES/LAWS/LOCKDOWNS PUT IN PLACE FOR YOU TO REALIZE THAT SOMETHING ELSE IS AT PLAY HERE? THAT THE GOVERNMENT DOES  NOT WANT TO RETURN TO NORMAL?</p>
<p>Fucking PATHETIC</p></p>

        <p>It's honestly amazing. Before this I had no idea that human beings could behave so much like mice or sheep.</p>
<p>Their whole reality has changed...a year later and 2 doses of an experimental injection we're now here.</p>

        <p>I remember back in the days pre-pandemic we would take the public transit in a region with a majority of old folks. Always sneezed and coughed all over the place with no measures to protect themselves or others. I always ended up with some type of horrible month of sickness. I was even insulted and called out for asking they should not sneeze and cough everywhere. It was disgusting honestly.</p>
<p>Nowadays you get called a grandma killer for not wanting an experimental injection and suddenly they're all fearing for their lives, calling you a young selfish idiot who's killing the old people. Suddenly they all take appropriate hygiene measures because daddy government told them so. But they never cared to do that before. </p>
<p>I'm sure there are a lot of sensibly mature and intelligent old people out there who aren't like this. Just as there are many young ones that are extremely immature. </p>
<p>But damn that is so frustrating. This whole thing is a joke. Whole of Covid-19 pandemic is a joke. Just showed how people crave social attention and validation from the government that they so called used to hate before, while shaming people.</p>

        <p>I'm old enough to remember a point where life was actually enjoyable but young enough that I'm a statistical outlier when it comes to social media use specifically. I haven't actively used it until things started turning south for many countries these past few weeks.</p>
<p>It IS frustrating. It IS a joke. It's SAD. There's a saying, that common sense increasingly seems to not be so common anymore...why can't we think for ourselves? Why are we deluded so fucking badly that we can't even see something right in front of fucking eyes? We have NEVER been divided on this level before. Even I, the few friends I have, have been divided. Virtually ALL my relatives are the same. 2016, sure, it was divisive politically in the US but you wouldn't have people calling you a MURDERER and acting like there's NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. You could still be friends with them, it wasn't as black and white, wasn't as instantly dismissive...there's so much more to be said but honestly, the more you think about what you had back then, the more longing you feel for what was back then.</p>
<p>I am filled with grief. This can't be real. Why has the human spirit eroded in this way? I'm not even old but goddamn, at least I'm alive!</p>
