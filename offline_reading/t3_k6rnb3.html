    <strong>My own family won't let me see them for xmas unless I test neg.</strong>
    <p><p>I [23F] tested positive on Nov. 27 and was sent home with a 10 day isolation order. I'm now on day 7 and as of yesterday became 100% symptom free. So in 3 days if I'm still symptom free, both the doctors and CDC say I'm non-contagious. The doctors near me said they'd provide me with official documentation stating I'm not contagious.
My parents and older sister still want me to get tested and from the looks of it, they don't want me coming home unless I get a neg. covid test but the doctors say I'll test positive bc the virus will still be in me. </p>
<p>LR;DR: Docs + CDC say I'll be non-contagious after 10 days of isolation if I'm symptom free. My own family will not accept official documentation stating this. They want me to get a neg. Covid test, but I can't bc I'll test positive.</p>
<p>Anyone else have this issue?</p></p>

        <p>Yes. The whole nation. It’s these false-positive results that they keep counting as a new ‘infection’. Since when does a positive result mean you are infected? Any family that’s more scared of the flu then their own child is fucked in the head. I’m sorry but this is some holy bullshit. That’s fucking cold. This is how powerful propaganda is and how brainwashed our society can become. You were isolated for fuck all and your family is now scared of you. Perfect. I’m sorry your going through this. Just know, every time you get tested your results get counted as a brand new infection and it gets added to count. Another strike against freedom.</p>

        <p>If my family even suggested something like that, I would never speak to them again. They'd be dead to me.</p>

        <p>I had Covid-19 in May. My family made me get tested in October when I saw them and they want me to get tested again before I come for Christmas. They are more of a risk to me because they work in hospitals and stuff and don't get tested before I come up. I'm sick of it.</p>

        <p>Nope, it was negative, mind you it was 5 months after my initial infection. The chances of me getting it again, especially so soon is minuscule. Yet they've never had it and they never get tested before I come up. It's ridiculous. The test itself is unpleasant enough as it is anyway.</p>

        <p>That’s ridiculous! Sorry you had to deal with this. 
I kind of know the feeling - my family insisted on me getting tested before coming home (despite me living alone and having basically no friends) and I told them I’d rather spend Christmas alone. They relented in the end, luckily.</p>
