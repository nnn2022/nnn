<title>I know 6 or 7 people that died last year. All of them died from overdoses or suicide. I felt like I was going to be next. They died from lockdowns not covid. They're part of the 150k people that nobody acknowledged or pretended to care about. They talked about protecting the kids but they killed us.</title>
