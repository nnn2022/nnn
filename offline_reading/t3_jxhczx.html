    <strong>Is it unfair of me to tell my friends I’m only doing in person hangouts from now on?</strong>
    <p><p>Need some advice from r/NoNewNormal,  my  friends  are  the  doomer  type  and  over the  summer  would  only  do  video  chats  or  when  it  was  warm  out  ”socially  distanced”  park  hangs.  I  bit  my  tongue  for  the  most  part  but  it  annoys  the  fuck  out  of  me,  I  think  how  they  are  behaving  is  dumb  as  hell.</p>
<p>Now they want to do a video chat hangout but I’m feel a lot of anxiety about it because it stresses me out, I’m just thinking the whole time how dumb these people are behaving. </p>
<p>My question is, would it be fair to tell them I’m not doing video chats anymore? As I’ve already been doing that for them the whole summer and they won’t even bend a little and do so much as a patio hang when that’s what I want. </p>
<p>Is this a fair boundary to set? Have any of you set something like this for your friends?</p></p>

        <p>It's fair. Tell them you'll hang out with them whenever they're comfortable doing in person hangouts. And that in the meantime, you won't be joining any Zoom happy hour bullshit.</p>
<p>It may be ballsy but those are your boundaries and you have a right to define them.</p>

        <p>My close childhood friend is a doomer as well and after tolerating his his anxiety a couple times I lost all desire to contact him. I was also supposed to spend the weekend with my friend and his new gf out of town but when I was told she requested my fiancee and I wear masks during the trip I cancelled on them. My advice to you is get some new friends who are normal and aren't afraid of their own shadows.</p>

        <p>I’m trying man but it’s unbelievably hard to make new friends right now, gym‘s closed, bars are closed, work is wfh, theres no in person classes anywhere. I don’t know where I can meet new people during this time that I click with. But I will take your advice, to be honest I made an excuse that I couldn’t do the video call, maybe I’ll be more forthright if they press the issue.</p>

        <p>Not sure how effective it is, but try Bumble BFF. My wife has made new friends this year using it. I know it's kind of weird using a version of a dating app to make friends but there is that option.</p>

        <p>I am going to have to look into this. I've been considering getting on Tinder. I have no interest in actually hooking up, but it seems like no one else wants to meet in person. I had no idea this was an option, so thanks for posting it!</p>

        <p>That's a really interesting idea. Is she making friends that are less doomery/anti-restrictions? I just moved somewhere and it would be so nice to find a way to make friends with people who are not buying into the bs.</p>

        <p>They are by no means the doomers you read about on reddit but they probably comply in public as not to rock the boat. They are perfectly fine with hanging out without any of the silly shit but the conversation always includes covid. It's almost unavoidable.</p>

        <p>The funny thing is, taking their fairy-tales serious for a moment, a test becomes worthless the moment you get the result - as you then still can become a "disease vector" according to their nonsense and get infected with the beerus a second after you got the result. </p>
<p>(And this will probably used by the fascists themselves to even further the enslavement as they may even demand constant ~~brain-stabbing~~ testing)</p>

        <p>Definitely fair. I don't do video calls with anyone, I find them weird, even pre-COVID. I work from home and we sometimes have team meetings that have us use a video camera, but I don't use mine. I don't want to get used to seeing people through a video feed. I want to get used to seeing people in real life.</p>

        <p>Hate to say it but you're going to need to cut them loose eventually. Why? Because they're buying the Kool-Aid the media and government is selling them and it does not look like they're going to stop.</p>
<p>Me, personally? I would air my concerns to them and be honest with them. If they are your friends as you say they are, they will respect what you have to say, and who knows, some them may actually agree with you.</p>

        <p>If it's fair for people to only do video chat and virtual hangouts, I don't see how it's unfair for you to do what you're comfortable with. Only you can decide what’s right for you, and if they won't compromise even a little, it seems unbalanced for you to be doing all the compromising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the record, the only phone/video meetings I've done are one job interview and a couple of times for someone I know with mobility issues who can't leave her house alone and I can't always go to her. Everyone else has pretty much accepted that whatever one of us has, we probably all have and treating each other like lepers won't help anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would highly encourage quality over quantity. It really helps to be around like-minded people, even if it's only one other person. I'm not saying that you should cut anyone out if you don't otherwise want to, but being stressed and anxious all the time really isn't worth it. It's never selfish to take care of yourself.</p>

        <p>It's far better to be genuine than to pretend, however you must be prepared for the consequences which inevitably will be social ostracization by this group. These "believers" are a hard core cult and therefore will likely, patronize you, ridicule you (when not listening) or outright reject you. So preferably you would want to make new friends with people, in your community? that your beliefs align with. It's certainly less stressful. I have a few strained relationships becasue I refuse to bend or pretend. I warn them that if they begin pandemic preaching, I will slam them with so many facts and statistical evidence their heads will spin for the next year, and as long as they don't broach the subject I will support them in doing whatever they need to do personally to feel safe.  This has been a tough ride nd it's only going to intensify. I really hearing the stories of how the civil war pitted brother against brother and divided families, however I think even these accounts will pale in comparison to the division and collateral damage COVID is ultimately going to cause.</p>
<p>I wish the best for you!</p>

        <p>I got pretty lucky, me, my boyfriend, my best friend, my sister, her best friend and her boyfriend all work at the same place now. We all carpool, get food together, hang put at my house and do game and movie nights, we really are doing everything we can to live as happy and genuine as we can right now. I totally get the anxiety btw you are not alone. The video calls are very distracting and not one bit productive. I would suggest, if you’re up for it, planning some sort of even like a game night and inviting them. If they’re up for it great if not that’s fine too. You deserve people in your life who will show up for you though and maybe they just haven’t considered or been invited to anything so hopefully they will come out for you. Wishing you the best!</p>

        <p>Just depends on how much interaction you'd like to have with your friends. If you like your friends, and want them to feel good about the interactions you're having with them, then videoconferencing is the way to go. Part of being a gentleman is making things easier for the people you care about.</p>
<p>If you refuse to video chat and that's all they are comfortable doing, then you'll be seeing even less of them. </p>
<p>I'd suggest simply opting out of individual meetings, rather than making a blanket refusal to interact in any way other than in person.</p>
