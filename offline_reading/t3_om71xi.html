    <strong>So I did my own math on the delta variant cases</strong>
    <p><p>First of all this is where I got the data from: <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1001358/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_18.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1001358/Variants_of_Concern_VOC_Technical_Briefing_18.pdf</a></p>
<p>So it's actual govt data. Pg 16 for the lazy ones. Decided to look at what's the % total of each outcome for each group (unvaccinated, both doses, less than 21 after 1st dose, more than 21 after 1st dose).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/wxay63s6nsb71.jpg?width=877&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=559940628cfed25fb18c17b56ab8695b5978c725</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/ebarg3s6nsb71.jpg?width=794&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=402f26f5147a8e2653cf73f4ebfc0091a87e4a84</p>
<p>From doing some basic math it looks like there's more unvaccinated catching delta variant yet the outcome in every single scenario is better for the unvaccinated. The ones that received both doses seem to have the worst outcome with a 10x higher chance of death. Oddly enough the groups that only had their first dose are doing about as good as the unvaccinated. It's almost as if there's longer term side effects. I don't think this is working guys. Also congratulations if you aren't vaxxed. Apparently you have a 99.87% chance of surviving delta. The world is clearly ending. </p>
<p>I've also decided to look at road traffic statistics in the UK and compare how risky traffic accidents are compared to the Delta variant just for the memes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/reported-road-casualties-great-britain-provisional-results-2020">https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/reported-road-casualties-great-britain-provisional-results-2020</a></p>
<p>In total there were 1472 traffic accident fatalities in 2020. Apparently the safest place to be is in the bus, the least safest place is the car and the second least safe place is the bloody sidewalk. </p>
<p>Next up thought I'd look at killed or seriously injured statistics. In total 23486 in the UK. 23486/66,650,000 (UK pop) * 100 = 0.035% chance of it happening to you. Now that's only about 1/5th of the chance compared to risk of death from delta variant in the unvaccinated population so I don't think we're taking this road stuff seriously.</p>
<p>Following doomer logic I think we should all ditch cars and walking and start to live underground. I've personally borrowed some money from my wife's boyfriend and used it to buy mining equipment. I will be digging socially distanced underground tunnels throughout the country and they are going to link every single home to every single bus stop. Stay safe guys and don't be selfish.</p></p>

        <p>This isn’t surprising since it’s he UK was so thorough in vaccinating high risk people first. A vaccinated 70 year old is still at a higher risk of death than a non vaccinated 35 year old, assuming the same underlying health conditions. There’s a reason OP conveniently left out the age column with the over 50 and under 50 rows. This article does a good job explaining this further. </p>

        <p>I didn't leave it out conveniently. I was lazy. Also under 50 or above 50 doesn't really say anything. A 50 year old with a balanced diet, that works out regularly with normal BMI is probably going to have a better chance with COVID vs a 30 year old with BMI in the 30+ range that lives a 100% sedentary lifestyle and only eats junk food and drinks fizzy drinks instead of water.</p>

        <p>Age is a big factor. It is not the only factor. This is why I said assuming the same underlying health conditions. The article does a good job of explaining this.</p>

        <p>Did it with age groups separate. There seems to be no benefit or a slight risk in doubled jabbed under 50s compared to the unvaccinated. To me pushing vaccines in younger groups doesn't make sense if it's at best no benefit and at worst an unknown number of multiple side effects. </p>
<p>In over 50s there's 2.5x higher risk in unvaccinated compared to double jabbed and for whatever reason those with 1 dose have done best in the over 50s group. Not 100% sure what's the risk reward between side effects and protection in over 50s, but side effects were more commonly reported among the younger population.</p>
<p>Now with the over 50s not even having 10k in each group makes it really unlikely to be relevant to general population.</p>
<p>My end thoughts is that making this mandatory for everyone is a load of nonsense.</p>

        <p>My main takeaway from this is there's a lot of selection bias going on. Older people and high risk people in both age brackets are more likely to take the vaccine. The vaccine does appear to help those people, but the remaining unvaccinated face almost no risk and should not take the vaccine so I agree with your conclusion. This is what I have felt all along - over 65 and those with comorbidities should take vax.</p>

        <p>The result you mention is totally due to the fact that people above the age 50 are 50% of the vaccinated group and only 1.4% of the unvaccinated group. That's why it make more sense to calculate using the age groups and find that vaccination effect on death rate is unsurprising :</p>
<p>- from 4.5% to 2.2% for &rt;50 (saves 230 per 100 000)</p>
<p>- from 0.035% to 0.029% for &lt;50 (saves 6 people per 100 000)</p>
<p>Notice that below 50 the death rate is very small and the vaccination change little (20% less)</p>
