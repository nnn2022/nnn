    <p><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>There’s a high chance of certainty that this sub will be banned. They will either pick a few crazy posts (probably from some shill) and use that as an excuse or hey won’t even bother and just ban.</p>
<p>YOU need to help YOU or YOU are gonna die or worse. How do you help you? By helping and sharing your skills and knowledge with other like minded people. I suggest this out there with skills in the following areas make groups on Telegram: Legal, Health, Fitness, Science, Recruitment, Christianity, Islam and whatever else you can think of. </p>
<p>Here are some suggested names:</p>
<p>NoNewNormalLegal</p>
<p>NoNewNormalHealth</p>
<p>NoNewNormalRecruitment</p>
<p>You get the idea. I have recently started a channel just as a meeting point and for sharing information. Please if you have skills and/or qualifications in any of these areas or others SHARE them we are stronger together.</p>
