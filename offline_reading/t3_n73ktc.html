    <strong>Received a permanent ban from a sub for posting real numbers. How weak minded are people?</strong>
    <p><p>I posted this:</p>
<p>&rt; Are you aware that a total of 3 people under the age of 20 in Ontario have died from corona since it came here?</p>
<p>&rt; The odds of young kids dying from this is incredibly small so their kids will likely be fine. As for endangering others, well that is why others like yourself and those at risk can go and get vaccinated to protect themselves.</p>
<p>&rt; Although the total number of deaths in Ontario for 59 and younger is 458. When you figure out the death rate for the total number of resolved cases they currently have, the death rate is 0.12%. That is very low actually and not much to be worried about. Also the number of resolved cases is likely higher as many people don't go get confirmation for having corona and many have corona with out any symptoms so they likely are not counted either. That all would put the death rate even lower.</p>
<p>&rt; Here, you can look up the numbers yourself if you think I'm lying to you.</p>
<p>&rt; https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data</p>
<p>That got me perma banned for spreading misinformation.  I asked the mods what misinformation I spread and it turns out they just don't like that I don't take it as seriously as them and then they muted me so I can't communicate with them for 28 days.  How childish of them.</p>
<p>Believe what I do or you're banned and silenced.  Pathetic.</p></p>

        <p>Dude I run into this all the time.</p>
<p>I always post factual data based on the government's official data (because then a Covid Karen can't argue with it).</p>
<p>It's shocking to me that people still can't comprehend how silly it is.</p>
<p>For example, using BC's data (I'm from bc), if the entire under 30 population contracted covid 19 at the same time in BC using current numbers, we would expect 7000 hospitalizations and 59 deaths.</p>
<p>That's for around 1.5 million people.</p>
<p>The fact that people then want to continue to believe this is some kind of world ending catastrophe makes 0 sense.</p>

        <p>They scream "trust the science" but then they either choose to ignore the damn numbers/data involved or they just plain don't understand them.  I just don't get these people.  And for the mods on those subs to be acting like this is just beyond ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Yeah, trust the science... Hilarious... How about the people in charge actually use the science to inform decisions instead of panic and fear!</p>
<p>I think the most criminal thing that was done here in Canada anyways, is that there has NEVER been clear instruction from government or health authorities to AVOID INTERGENERATIONAL MIXING.</p>
<p>Its literally the only thing that should have been promoted from literally April of 2020 after Italian data was coming out that made it extremely clear who was and who was not at risk.</p>
<p>The government could have taken a cautious approach and asked everyone 50+ to stay home in the March lock downs if they were working off the science, asking people to avoid dinners with grandma and grandpa etc. But they didn't do that.</p>
<p>We could have left 90% of the workforce at work and keeping goods and services moving, without literally any change in the mortality rate.</p>
<p>Most of my friends wives are nurses and we argue plenty. They always claim "oh we couldn't split the rules up based on ages, it would have been impossible".... Which is such a cop out.</p>
<p>Of course we could have.</p>
<p>It would have saved lives and saved the economy.</p>
<p>Nothing makes me angrier than knowing that Trudeau and his idiot government handed out 200 billion borrowed dollars to force people under 60/50 to stay home or close their businesses for no medical benefit whatsoever.</p>
<p>Its a complete sham and the fact that anyone still supports that bozo is beyond me.</p>

        <p>So, Ontario counts every death with covid as a covid death. They actually just had their first real covid death, as far as I can tell, in a minor. She died at home and was not getting care.</p>

        <p>I've had to use a second hand to begin counting the number of subs that deem <strong>copy + pasted information off of FDA, CDC, NEJM, NIH, BMJ, WHO sites for misinformation</strong></p>
<p>Here is the US's statistics for what you got banned for (which could never be posted to another sub just because the headline is too shocking):</p>
<p>https://www.aier.org/article/more-covid-suicides-than-covid-deaths-in-kids/</p>

<p>Suicide is a larger contributor of deaths in people under 25 than Covid.</p>

        <p>If you have a very basic understanding of statistics and look at the data that the government of Ontario publically releases...it's quite shocking that people are buying into all this crap. </p>
<p>These are the SAME numbers that "health authorities and experts" are looking at to make their decisions and projections. </p>
<p>If you tell people these stats they are happy to ignore you and rebut with exactly what they hear on the news. Absolutely zero critical thinking or original thought.</p>

        <p>I'm amazed at the people so eager to get their young kids vaccinated too.  They still think kids are in mortal danger to corona despite only 4 under the age of 20 having died in Ontario since this all started.</p>
<p>Hey lets run out and give an experimental vaccine to kids that no one knows if it will have any long term effects despite the fact that the under 20 group faces a mortality risk of 0.0057 percent according to the latest numbers.</p>
<p>I never thought people of any age group would be so willing and eager to volunteer to become medical test subjects.  Just shows how crazy the impact of fear is on the average person.</p>
