    <strong>2 parallels between the mask and social media</strong>
    <p><p>Both reduce communication. Remove nuance. It leads to misinterpretation, intentional and unintentional. Conversation gets clumsier and more solipsistic.</p>
<p>Both provide anonymity (real and imagined). A protection. We are free to be as evil as we want to be. And it appears that many of us want to be evil.</p>
<p>I think that masks make real life more like online life.</p>
<p>People will dare to be stupider and eviler, behind the screen or behind the mask.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, one simple examples is glances. Before, if I was at a grocery store and some kid looked at me, sometimes they'd look with a cautious, neutral look (I'm a big black dude). I'd smile back, and every single time that happened they would smile back. The implication being, I'm not a threat.</p>
<p>Now... I've had that happen with others, and with the masks, there's no way to communicate that. We just stare at each other cautiously... no joke, I thought some other guy was giving me the stink eye the other day at the coffee shop. Then when I went outside, he followed me!</p>
<p>I was ready for this guy to try something. Instead, he told me he loved my shirt! Because I couldn't see his face, I didn't know he had been staring at me in a non-aggressive way.</p>

        <p>I've been walking into stores without my mask lately and I smile at everyone. Yet all I see if people giving me dirty looks. I truly think the mask let's others treat each other like animals or objects and not humans. My fuse is running short with every passing day. One day that smile will be an angry scowl without the mask. How quickly were we ok with turning off our humanity? Is this what the elite wanted? Because right vs left, black vs white, straight vs gay wasn't working?</p>

        <p>Definitely agree. There’s a lot of internet mask warriors and creeps that will take candid shots of you if you’re not wearing a mask. This generation is getting too comfortable and forgetting that there are consequences to their actions. You can’t get away with calling strangers ‘covidiots’ in real life. You aren’t just going to go outside harassing random people and come back home without a nosebleed. I don’t wear my mask and I’ve never run into a doomer. They don’t bother you when they have a chance of losing the invincibility spell they have online.</p>
<p>A lot of these pro-maskers love to fling insults instead of making any logical arguments. Their echo chamber says they’re right, so they don’t listen to any differing opinions. It’s comical how they talk like they’re altruistic superheroes saving lives. Like the class nerd being proud to receive his gold star for being a compliant hall monitor snitching on all of his classmates.</p>

        <p>They are censoring on social media and they are encouraging distance in real life. They are probably trying to prevent people from organizing militias and getting the truth out. If you don't talk to your neighbor, you can't get into a conversation and realize you both agree this is all bullshit.</p>

        <p>This is the real reason. During the summer I was at the pool with neighbors and we talked about getting a militia together. Now if we were masked and not allowed to go out that discussion wouldn't have been had out in the open.</p>
