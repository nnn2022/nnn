    <strong>People who work at employers with mandates</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>Were you surprised that your employer did it? Did they seem like the type?</li>
<li>Was there ever a time that they said they wouldn't? </li>
<li>How did they tell you? </li>
<li>Were there events or messages leading up to the bigger announcement that in retrospect were probably steps to the roll out? (Eg more mentions of the vaccine in company emails, health surveys, new roles in HR)</li>
<li>How did people react?</li>
</ol></p>

<li>No. Yes, they are receiving funding from large pharma and government entities. </li>
<li>No. They were foaming at the mouth for the legal "go" signal to make everyone take it. </li>
<li>List serv email with a date deadline, then supervisors sending "reminders"</li>
<li>Yes, they announced all students had to have it first. Every attempt to return to a normal format was caveated with "once everyone's vaccinated". </li>
<li>Noone talked about it, they did it via anonymous email and upload of verification. The only people that mentioned it were the ones that couldn't help but let everyone know they uploaded their cards!!! </li>
</ol>
<p>I was fired for refusing to comply. My job was 100% remote, and I told them that I would not disclose my medical information to them. They told me I would be let go, and that was that.</p>

        <p>What was the rationale for requiring it for remote workers? Or did they even need to give one?</p>

        <p>They wanted to require it of every single person the company interacted with, including visitors, volunteers, and contractors. If they had a reason, they would require your pet to get vaccinated. They are incredibly politically motivated. </p>
<p>The reason they gave was </p>
<p>a) refusing vaccination was "anti-thetical" to the missions of public health (it's a big PH org.) </p>
<p>b) They wanted me to change the conditions of my employment so that I would have to report to an office on their site 2x a week, lol. Never mind I would still be 100% working on my computer with people in other parts of the country, they just wanted to use the condition as a tool to leverage my acceptance of the vaccination. </p>
<p>It was quite silly to be honest. And if I hadn't faced similar hardships in my life before, I would feel quite desperate and angry. Their loss really.</p>

        <p>I see. They probably didn't want the message to get out like "even people at [your public health org] arent getting it." I had not considered the "living the mission" angle.</p>
<p>We do on-site visits and many of our clients' employers have instituted a policy for their employees. If a major competitor comes out as the safer choice because they are all vaxxed or we are having our people denied from entering places of business, we're doomed.</p>

        <p>That's a tough one. I've worked for so many years with no break in between and I've paid a shit load of taxes. I wouldn't abuse the unemployment as some do, but I'd definitely take it while actively searching for new employment.</p>

        <p>Yea and I agree with you on that, I did not mean to insinuate you don't deserve it. I don't deserve it because I'm young and my tax contribution is minimal. You should at least attempt it. Don't resign. I am sorry I can't be of more help; I hope God helps you find your path forward!</p>

        <p>So far no mandates for us, but every day it seems like more and more of our clients are instituting these policies and having a full return to office. We are still 100% remote. I'd be naive to think it's not being discussed as ideally, our people would be seeing clients in person.</p>

<li>No </li>
<li>Yes, but encouraged it. </li>
<li>Email after months of saying they would not </li>
<li>Yes- they had an all hands meeting a week before talking about how serious Delta was.</li>

<p>I wasn’t surprised since it was happening already in my area. This actually only applies you you choose to come into the building but we are now all remote and don’t have to come in really ever.</p>

<li>No. They're in bed with WEF. Definitely the type.</li>
<li>No. Their previous message was "strongly encourage," no promises made one way or another leading up to the mandate.</li>
<li>They sent a company wide email "from the ceo." it was full of doomer propaganda.</li>
<li>Not really. They spam all of us with pointless emails all the time. They sent a lot of "covid is scary, get an experimental injection!" emails. They also sent many other unrelated emails.</li>
<li>It's about 50/50. The doomer types are pissing their pants with glee. Some are actually getting injected. Others like myself are happy in choosing not to get the shot. Even if that means getting fired.</li>
