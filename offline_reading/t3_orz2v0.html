        <p>If they didn't want routine testing of healthy unvaccinated people this would make sense but since so many schools etc are talking about testing healthy students, I don't get it. If you have no signs of illness it doesn't matter if your body is fighting it off via your natural immune system or a vaccine, your chances of spreading it are the same. This is clearly just an attempt to suppress how useless these vaccines are.</p>

        <p>My vaxxed friend was training with her vaxxed coworker who ended up getting sick and tested positive for Covid last week. My friend said she wasnâ€™t concerned and went to Disneyland this weekend.</p>

        <p>My goodness.  Reading this article I feel like Winston out of 1984.</p>
<p>This is what I have been saying since the very fucking beginning.  It's useless to test asymptomatic people.  In fact, it might even be detrimental to test asymptomatic people, as necessarily you will be introducing many false positive cases.</p>
<p>Of course, I was shouted down and attacked.  A "conspiracy theorist".  This idea was much too "Trumpian" for the liberal intelligentsia.  The PCR test was the "gold standard".  Apparently it was possible you could have this virus, and it would "incubate" inside (<em>Aaahhh!!  The incubation period!!</em>).  </p>
<p>Apparently perfectly normally healthy people could be walking around transmitting a sUpEr DeAdLy ViRuS.  So, we have to shut it all down.  Sorry, you have to lose your job and your business and all your life's savings because look at all the asymptotic people!  Aaahhh!</p>
<p>But now, they realize they will never get case counts down if they continue to test using PCR technology.  So now they change the rules again.</p>
<p>Never too see here folks.  Just them changing the rules again.  Oh, and look at that!  Numbers seem to be going down!  AMAZING!!  It's almost as though when you change the definitions, you can achieve anything you want!!</p>
<p>Why are people still falling for this?  When did everyone become stupid??</p>
