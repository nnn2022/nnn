    <strong>Makes my blood boil</strong>
    <p><p>How can people not see how covid vaccine mandates for ANYTHING is completely stupid? And that if you don't have the vaccine, they say you should be constantly tested/stay away from society.</p>
<p>There is NO point of vaccine mandates or constantly testing the unvaccinated since vaccinated people can STILL catch and spread the virus. Make it make sense, please I'm begging you.</p>
<p>"You need some vaccines to travel internationally"
Tried and true vaccines to prevent catching and spreading illnesses that are deadlier than covid, yes. And still, not having those vaccines don't prevent you from participating in everyday life and you don't have to get constantly tested for the illness.</p>
<p>"Make it into law"
A law that requires people to inject themselves, a law that requires people to make a medical decision that only affects that person's body permanently, a law that where if anything happens to that person by being forced to do something they can't sue the company or get compensation by their employees, etc. Is a terrible law.</p>
<p>"What about seatbelts"
Imo, you can take off a seatbelt. You can't un-inject the vaccine after leaving the "proper" situation where one would be required/useful. Wearing a seatbelt is actually a very simple decision, whereas medical treatments are not.</p>
<p>Medical decisions should not be left up to a government or employer, especially in this case. Let's not pretend it's to protect others because that's just not the case.</p>
<p>If you're vaccinated, leave those who aren't the hell alone considering you're protected. After all, your whole point about getting everyone vaccinated who can be is to protect those who can't get the vaccine. But at the same time, you're saying those who we should be protecting you also want to be restricted from things the vaccinated can do?</p>
<p>Anyone, please. Make it make sense.</p>
<p>And don't get me started on natural immunity being completely left out of the conversation. Anyway, two articles i saw this morning that made my blood boil. You're welcome.</p>

        <p>Imagine you are a COVID doomer. Just for a moment.</p>
<p>As a doomer, you have spent the past year and a half watching the news every day, seeing the case numbers rise, seeing the deaths pile up. You believe it all, and have no doubts that it is true. Your stomach churns with anger and pain as you truly believe an epidemic is raging which is slaughtering people. The hospitals are full. And it could affect me! Long COVID can cause you to have permanent lung damage, permanently lose sense of smell, among other things!</p>
<p>Right, it's time to go to the store to buy bread. I'm scared I will contract the virus, but I need to eat. The case numbers are up by 1,000 cases today, I really hope I'm not carrying! We need to get this virus under control! Wait, WHAT? There's someone NOT WEARING A MASK?! Your blood begins to boil. Your heart starts pounding, and your breath quickens. All of the fear, rage, tragedy of the past year of mainstream news coverage flashes before your eyes. The numbers are UP TODAY and this SELFISH PIECE OF SHIT is not wearing a mask?!?!</p>
<p>"Kill them all" you mumble to yourself. Force them to be vaccinated. I don't care any more. They don't care about anyone else - we shouldn't care about them. They believe disinformation on the internet, and they are probably racist misogynists too who voted for Trump. I hate these people. I don't care if they have no life any more - they will get vaccinated and they will like it. They need to learn to care for others. Or else we will never go back to normal.</p>

        <p>I guess they're stuck with doublespeak because they need the public to believe the shots immunize people so they can justify the passports but at the same time the vaxed keep testing positive and dying of Covid.</p>
<p>Maybe this is why they're now trashing the PCR tests. They'll stop testing and just state that vaxed have immunity, no one else does.</p>
<p>This is why I don't understand why anyone trusts a word that comes out of their mouths. They are all demonic liars.</p>

        <p>Why didn't Jen Psaki identify the 12  individuals who are spreading misinformation as Phd scientists &amp; Md's? Because then everyone sees the tyranny! Why Peter didn't have the common sense to point that out is beyond me. Maybe someone will confront them appropriately.</p>

        <p>It makes my blood boil too, especially when every day there is yet another school or business requiring proof of vaccination (yesterday crossroads kitchen in LA announced they will only serve vaccinated people) while at the same time, yet another city or state announces multiple breakthrough cases and deaths! How can ANYONE not see how utterly stupid it is to require the vaccine? Vaccinated people are still getting, transmitting and dying of covid! I am starting to think that for the doomers who enact this policies and the ones who support them, it’s because they MUST follow the agenda and continue to believe that covid is the greatest threat to our existence in history. Because the moment they stop believing, they are admitting the government and health experts were wrong and have been lying to them all along. And THAT would be worse than anything. So they just keep following along rather than admit they’ve been lied to for over a year.</p>
