    <strong>is this really how it’s going to be from now on?</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like dying. I try to stay positive but I really cannot take it anymore. I AM MISERABLE. I live in Belgium where everything has been in lockdown since november with a curfew. they promised to finally reopen café’s on 1st of may but now they are turning noses and thinking about opening up „around may 8”. which also isn’t sure yet. this has been going on for the last 7 months. they keep promising to end the lockdown to still prolong it for another few weeks as if it’s nothing. and to hear the news on the radio every single fucking day about ‚unresponsible and selfish students who throw secret parties or stay outisde after the curfew’ is honestly so demeaning. hoooow can you expect us, young people who barely hang on nowadays to cope wirh this bullshit when we can’t even have a day off and enjoy life? how tf does the govt expect us to care anymore? we want freedom. what the fuck? uni’s only have online classes since last year so there has never been a physical class that I could attend this year. I don’t have a job since the first lockdown because of hotels and café’s closing down. I barely see people, I barely buy something for myself because I barely have money for food. I hate seeing my mom struggle who had lost her job as well and still tries to provide for me and my studies. my profs don’t understand my lack of motivation because „everybody is going through it”. for some, opening up also means better income, not only fun. I hate compromising my own life for ppl I don’t give a flying fuck about. how is this life? I wished people would fucking stop being pussies and just fight for freedom by not abiding these clownish and inhumane laws. WHAT.THE.FUCK.</p></p>

        <p>Idk man. To me it looks like people got the tyranny they didn't even know they wanted, and now they'll fight to preserve it out of a desire to control others. It's still possible to meet people like us though. Stay mask free and actively seek out opportunities to be social.</p>

        <p>no, i curse out people on the radio who curse out the students for doing that. excuse my bad english, not my native language. i cannot stand people shitting on students for doing that, since the people saying that have an actual job and can go outside while we cannot. sorry for any misunderstanding</p>

        <p>THANK YOU! glad to have someone who understands. i was actually asking around if people would be down. chances look bleak but luckily there’s been protests almost everyday now here. sadly, my friends really don’t get it. it’s like they accepted the fate. one of em literally said they had lost all hope but also won’t fight because ‘rules are there for reasons’</p>

        <p>They’ve been demoralized then, 2020 caused a rift to form between me and my best friends man 😔. They got caught up in the narrative and when I show them alternative information they just go straight to “oh that’s conspiracy” or “oh if we would all just be patient things will go back to normal” They don’t understand the our government, big tech, and big Pharma will never give up the power and wealth they’ve accumulated. They don’t understand that’s it not about health but control.</p>

        <p>yes!!!! i truly believe it is about control, i say that all the time. luckily there is this one person who is on my side. people who kind of accept their fate just don’t have the courage i suppose, i get it, it is very scary now. my mom grew up during the soviet union so she has been taught to question authority and now my mom says it’s 1980 all over again. sad. i believe there won’t be freedom given untill we take it back.</p>

        <p>I get how it is we in the Netherlands have it to. At this point it has become a paradox the lockdown keeps getting lengthened because people throwing parties and because it keeps getting lengthened people are throwing parties. At this point it needs to stop somewhere and the most responsible and safe option is for the parties to stop so people can survive</p>

        <p>i think the best option is lighten the measures. i believe the tougher the restrictions, the more people will try to break the law. it seems like there is no end in sight and that is making us angry. we just want a bit of freedom, that is all. and you can make it safe as well. no need to close down every single place.</p>

        <p>just because you read and believe the mainstream media, doesn’t mean that it’s true. it’s been „proven” many times. there is sooo much inconsistency with many conflicting articles about the validity of the vaccines(suddenly you need 3 fucking shots for one fucking virus w/ a 99% survival rate??????), the lockdowns, the origin of the virus, the infection rate, the number of deaths. idk if you have read it, but there was recently an article that was out about a CNN director that admitted to blowing up and lying about the number of covid deaths to make it seem more scary https://www.opindia.com/2021/04/cnn-hoped-for-more-covid-19-deaths-shows-project-veritas-leak-technical-director-charlie-chester/amp/ . why? what would they do that for? to make the people stay home and stay compliant. why do they tell us we have to keep the same measures even after the majority gets vaccinated? here in Belgium, most of the elderly people are vaccinated now, why try to follow the rules if the younger people are likely to survive? it just doesn’t make sense? why do they treat us liek kindergarteners? if you are so scared, you stay home, but don’t expect me to give a fuck about you iust because you are a hypochodriac. i am not saying it does not exist. i am saying it’s blown out of proportion. it’s been a year. idk where you live, but here the horeca has been shut down since november. i come from a working class family, to me opening up means also financial stability, bc obviously the govt won’t help out a student in need. i need to fucking make my own money because my parents have it hard as well. the govt doesn’t care about that and neither do pieces of shit like u. so shut the fuck up. u have no idea what you are talking about. idk about you, but i am not a fucking loser and i need my social life back for my own mental sanity as well. prolonging this shit won’t help in any way.</p>
