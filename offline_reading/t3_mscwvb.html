    <strong>Masks are just another way to make Americans view other Americans as "different" and anything "different" divides us.</strong>
    <p><p>"you choose to wear a mask, I view you differently"</p>
<p>"You choose to not wear a mask, I view you differently"</p>
<p>The government has the ability to make a certain option good, and the other option bad. So people view others as either good or bad, depending on how they view the pandemic's seriousness.</p>
<p>It's in the news, on social media, in pop culture, and even on some tv shows now. And the government controls them all. </p>
<p>And I'm not just talking about masks and covid-19. Pay attention to EVERYTHING you consume (read or watch) on a daily basis. At least one of those things will mention two different groups of people or behaviors of people and only one group is the good one and the other group is the bad one. And the consumers of the media form their opinions based on that. </p>
<p>Stop viewing people as different. Stop viewing other people's freedom of choice as bad or illogical or misinformed or wrong. Stop viewing others as different than yourself. Because once you start viewing people differently, you're giving control over to the government. Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>Person A: People should wear masks to keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>Person B: People should be allowed to make their own decisions on wearing a mask. I don't wear masks. </p>
<p>A and B are both on a subway train. A and B are quietly scrolling through their phone, minding their own business. </p>
<p>An officer enters the train and approaches B and says, "Excuse me, do you have a mask? A mask is required to use the train system."</p>
<p>Person B replies, "No, sir. I have a medical condition and can't wear a mask." </p>
<p>The officer says, "What is your medical condition and do you have a note from a doctor to prove this?"</p>
<p>(The police are not allowed to demand to see medical information without a warrant)</p>
<p>Person B does not have the information with them and tells the officer that. </p>
<p>The officer then tells B that they need to exit the train. </p>
<p>B gets a little upset and doesn't want to leave the train. She didn't break any laws or cause a public disturbance to even warrant harassment by the police. </p>
<p>The officer threatens to arrest B for trespassing. B is still upset doesn't want to leave the train because she needs transportation to somewhere. </p>
<p>The officer arrests B for trespassing. (For trespassing, not for refusing to wear a mask, mind you) </p>
<p>Person A sees the whole interaction and doesn't say a word. Everyone on the train saw the whole interaction and doesn't say a word about the situation. </p>
<p>Imagine this whole interaction was real, and it was filmed, and went viral. And, everyone laughed at Person B and called them a Karen and said they got what they deserved. </p>
<p>Well, that did happen. Why did it happen? It happened because Person B was different. </p>
<p>Person B did not break any laws. Person B was arrested for trespassing. Not for refusing to wear a mask. Person B did not do anything prior to the officer approaching them to warrant the approach. Everyone on the train was complicit with what the officer did. Why? Again, because person B was different. </p>
<p>Everyone aboard that train was complicit with the officer arresting someone for something that wouldn't even have been an issue before May 2020, all because they were different. </p>
<p>I'm going to say something here that might totally discredit everything I've been trying to say in this post and something that might offend A LOT of people, but I feel like it really needs to be said to put what I'm trying to say into a much easier perspective.</p>
<p>The people on that train were the same kinds of people that stood by and watched while the Nazi's arrested the Jewish. And the Jewish did nothing wrong to warrant being arrested, yet everyone watched while remaining silent. Because they were different and that's just how things were at the time. I bet you've all wondered why and how a whole country just stood by and watched Germany's regimen do what they did. Because it didn't happen overnight. First, they started with propaganda against a certain group, and before they realized it, it was already too late to change anything.</p>
<p>Stop viewing people as different. That's all I'm trying here. Just my opinion.</p>
<p>Rant over. I'll probably delete this :x</p></p>
