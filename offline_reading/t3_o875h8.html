    <strong>The truth is...</strong>
    <p><p>I would rather die than have to live with the feeling of not accomplishing my goals and dreams and for a long time now, my dreams were to travel to Europe and see all of Europe but now, that looks to be like a pipedream. I'm not taking an experimental jab just to travel. I refuse to give in. I won't subject myself to this shit.....even if it costs me my dreams. I'm 22 no wife, no girlfriend, no children. This is what I wanted to do with my life, but dreams were made to be broken....Its sad. I am sad, angry depressed, but it is what it is. That's life...unless there's some kind of miracle which I doubt at this point, I fully expect to go out fighting within the next year or 2</p></p>

        <p>sorry in advanced if im misinterpreting this, but in case im not... in 2017 i was severely ill and in constant pain that was on the brink of being intolerable, I had financial issues from not being able to work due to being so sick and needing to spend money on health, I had no money and was leaving some kinda weird domestic violence/forced confinement situation that I can barely remember now. I had a 48 hr plan to off myself bc i just could not think of a way to prevent a long excruciating death. I made my peace with it and wrote my goodbye letters. The morning after i made the choice that i was gonna start "the plan" first thing in the morning, someone found me and helped me i guess she sensed that I needed help and she showed me how to get the first few things I needed sorted out, and it was just step by step after that. There was no way I could see through it, but the stars lined up so many times for me and I've made it through things for the most part. If you're thinking off anything like that, I respect your choice, and I don't blame you but also I just wanna say from my personal experience that sometimes stuff somehow works out</p>

        <p>In my 20’s I fucked them up and wasted them. It was my 30’s that life became meaningful. I hadn’t even travelled until I met my now wife and I count myself lucky I got to travel a little bit before this happened. Now as a Father they’re all that matters now anyway I can die happy knowing I created some great little humans. </p>
<p>You need to stop worrying about what you don’t have and be thankful for what you do have. I guarantee you have a better life than 75% of this planet and you’re wasting it feeling sorry for yourself. </p>

        <p>Just hold on. The dam is starting to break. Singapore has announced they will be a accepting covid as an endemic disease and stop attempting this covid zero nonsense. In the meantime Mexico is open without testing and same with Columbia. Travel there for awhile, Mexico is huge and extremely diverse, lots to see and do.</p>

        <p>It is extremely important not to give up hope - even though it seems hopeless at the moment.  More and more medical professionals are calling bullshit and standing up; don't forget that those who are pushing this agenda are rather wealthy and powerful - this is the David vs Goliath story we're witnessing and part of.  </p>
<p>It's easy to throw in the towel - and persistence is key to getting people to take the jab.  We need to keep persistent in fighting the norm.</p>
