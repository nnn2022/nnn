    <strong>How's Canada doing?</strong>
    <p><p>I hear a lot (and probably too much) about America. But I was just wondering about Canada (specifically Ontario). What are the "new pandemic rules" in Canada? I heard things are bad but tell me, how is it? And how is the general population reacting to it? For how long do you guys think this will keep going? What's the "foreseeable future" looking like?</p></p>

        <p>Hm it's pretty fucked in Ontario bud but it could have been a whole lot worse had the police and public not barked back at the government over what they tried to do this past Friday. </p>
<p>They tried to give the police the authority to stop anyone outside their house and ask them why they were out and what their address was (we have a stay at home order in place).  If they didn't comply it was a $750 ticket.  They also wanted to close playgrounds, again.  But there was a backlash from the public and police and that shit got repealed within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Not out of the woods by a long shot though.  ICUs are still apparently overwhelmed and still got public health people and science advisors calling for stupid shit.  Also one politician wrote an open letter to Justin the Chinese Communist Party admirer Trudeau asking for the Emergencies Act to be invoked which would basically give him the power to instate martial law.</p>
<p>Ya bud it's fucked eh</p>

        <p>Sittin at home drinkin beer collectin them crb checks.....loll but seriously for me same as it’s been already for a year....even when they opened restaurants it Was like 20% capacity so we barely even went cus it was always a line up....if they restrict us any more I think ppl will loose it there will be riots, lots. So I’m hoping they won’t do anything stupid like martial law. I’m optimistic tho that this hoax will finally reveal those who are controlling it and it will end. Hopefully they will see that they can’t just do what they please with the population and get away with it.</p>

        <p>Obviously Ford's announcement made a lot of people mad, which led to them walking it back within 24 hours.  I'm not really sure where we're at with that overall though, like I'm pretty sure that police can still stop you for any reason if they want, and give you a ticket, but I've also seen most police forces come out and actively say they won't being doing that.  Playgrounds are open again though, so that's good for the kids.</p>
<p>We're actually seeing ads on TV now calling for Ford's resignation, so it's clear that people are (rightfully) pissed, and these aren't just the anti-lockdown people either.</p>
<p>Regarding ICUs, I work in health care and have some colleagues in Toronto.  To my understanding, the hospitals are quite overwhelmed, but it's really just in the major Toronto hospitals, and not really anywhere else.  It's a bit mis-leading for the government to claim that the ICUs are all overwhelmed when its really just isolated to one major city.  We're seeing patients being moved to hospitals in other regions to make more space in Toronto, plus I believe some temporary hospitals have been built, although I'm not sure why this was only done 13+ months into this thing.</p>
<p>As weird as it sounds, I actually think Ford's recent announcement was a good thing for Ontario overall.  People are realizing that these restrictions really have no evidence behind them, as even Ford's "top doctors" are speaking out against him.  I also think it's telling that Ford would enact these new measures (presumably to "save lives") and then walk them back within a day because people were pissed.  If these measures had evidence behind them that they'd actually save lives, then I imagine Ford wouldn't walk them back so quickly.  I think that definitely demonstrates how much a lot of these restrictions are just "for show".</p>
