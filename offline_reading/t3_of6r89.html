        <p>It's going to be a 'hard sell' technique on you, they will assess your objections, note your behaviour and hold it in a database.</p>
<p>Much like dealing with the Police, do not answer questions.</p>
<p>If you haven't noticed it yet 2021 has had many government bodies from your insurance company to local government to businesses to others phoning, mailing or offering you $$$ incentives or other to 'refresh your information' or submit information you normally wouldn't give them as well as they have no access to.</p>

        <p>The “vaccine” push is intensifying. Given that our overlords are eugenicists, there’s a sad story that serves as a warning. Dr. Kalokerinos stated how they used to chase down malnourished aboriginal kids and repeatedly “vaccinate” them. Of course, it’s always cloaked as for the “greater good.”</p>
<p><strong>”…the further I looked into it the more shocked I became. I found that the whole vaccine business was indeed a gigantic hoax. Most doctors are convinced that they are useful, but if you look at the proper statistics and study the instance of these diseases you will realise that this is not so.</strong></p>
<p>I think the most obvious example of <strong>the harm that vaccines can do</strong> is demonstrated by what happened in 75-76. <strong>I received a phone call</strong> from a politician who was elected to a position where <strong>he had some responsibility for Aboriginal health in the Northern Territory</strong>. This man had, in fact, been a patient of mine. <strong>He was concerned because the infant death rate in the Northern Territory had doubled in one year,</strong> and looked as if it was going to double again. <strong>There was no obvious explanation.</strong> I knew the Northern Territory fairly well, in fact I had walked over a lot of it, and could not see how this could be explained. I thought about it a lot, and as I traveled around the world I talked to people about it and asked questions and looked for advice. I came back to Australia and I went out to visit my mother, and staying with my mother at the time was my youngest brother who was a medical student, and he had with him a fellow medical student. I sat down with them and discussed the problem again, and <strong>I went through every factor that I new that could be responsible for making a child sick and resulting in a death.</strong> And one of the things that I did know a little bit about, not a lot then but I had some experience, was <strong>the fact that under certain circumstances these vaccines could be very dangerous.</strong> And I didn’t mention it. And when I finished I went into my car and I drove towards the city where I was staying at a hotel. Halfway there it just hit me like a bomb. <strong>When this politician rang me up he said in an endeavor to improve the Aboriginal mortality we stepped up the vaccination campaigns. And that is what had done it. They were actually immunising sick kids.</strong> The next day I took off by plane to go to the Northern Territory and I was excited by the realisation that <strong>at last I had the answer to the problem,</strong> but I was naturally concerned because I did not know how to communicate it. Well I went to the Northern Territory. <strong>No one would listen to it</strong> I was regarded as a total utter redbag. But I found that they were visiting the reservations, the <strong>outlying camps of Aboriginees in the desert, and if for some reason a mother didn’t want her child to be vaccinated they would simply grab the child and forcibly vaccinate it. I saw them chasing them on foot, and chasing them in Landrovers and grabbing the kids and vaccinating them. Now, a lot of these kids were terribly sick. They were malnourished and everything else.</strong> And if they survived the first vaccine, In a few weeks they would come back with booster shots. And then with <strong>more and more, and then they would come around with polio shots and so forth. It is a wonder that any kid survived really</strong>, not that the death rate had just doubled. It is a wonder that any one survived. So it was a pretty grim sort of situation, and it has never really been fully corrected.</p>
<p><strong>The other thing of interest is that in 1977-78 there was an epidemic of a very peculiar disease in Naples, Italy.</strong> They called it the dark disease of Naples where <strong>infants and children would suddenly become unconscious</strong> without any special reason and autopsies would not really reveal a cause. <strong>Now this was just the sort of trouble I saw amongst Aboriginees.</strong> So, to make a long story short I went over with a "60 minute" television team, and <strong>we found that two thirds of the infants and children had upper respiratory tract infections, but one third of them had just been recently vaccinated with triple antigen including whooping cough vaccine.”</strong></p>
<p>“IVN: So <strong>what is your final conclusion</strong> from your experience after so many years?</p>
<p>Kalokerinos: <strong>My final conclusion</strong> after forty years or more in this business is that the unofficial policy of the World Health Organisation and <strong>the unofficial policy of Save the Children’s Fund and almost all those organisations is one of murder and genocide. They want to make it appear as if they are saving these kids, but in actual fact they don’t. I am talking of those at the very top.</strong> Beneath that level is another level of doctors and health workers, like myself, who don’t really understand what they are doing. But I cannot see any other possible explanation: <strong>It is murder and it is genocide. And I tell you what: when the black races really wake up to what we have done to them they are not going to thank us very much.</strong> And if you want to see what harm vaccines do, don’t come to Australia or New Zealand or any place, go to Africa and you will see it <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/06/28/534403083/mutant-strains-of-polio-vaccine-now-cause-more-paralysis-than-wild-polio">there.”</a></p>
