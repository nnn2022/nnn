        <p>I know this will likely fall on deaf ears and blind eyes here, but I suggest people study these comments. Much of what is being said is how people really feel: tired of the restrictions, but also feeling like prisoners to them, and forcing themselves to adhere to them because "there's no other choice". They have deluded themselves into believing they are prisoners indefinitely (at least three comments mention 5 years as the time the "pandemic" ends). Part of it is a victim and helplessness complex that's been ingrained onto the populace, and another is just people, yet again, succumbing to tribalism and groupthink. They can't break out of these chains they placed on themselves because they truly believe they are stuck and if they do remove their chains, it means an immediate death sentence for themselves and/or their loved ones.</p>
