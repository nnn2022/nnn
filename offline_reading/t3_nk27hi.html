    <strong>What we’re seeing is eerily similar to Nazism. In many ways, it is the EXACT same</strong>
    <p><p>I feel compelled to share all the ways which this is similar to Nazism, but it might not all perfectly connect. First some context. Throughout history, we’ve seen genocides carried out in 10 distinct steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>⁠Classification. The creation of the “in-group vs out-group”. This one is obvious, and it’s clearly the vaccinated and unvaccinated. In Germany, it was Jews vs Germans.</li>
<li>⁠Symbolization. Another obvious one. Masks have become a symbol of safety, but now they’re a symbol of dirtiness, disease, and lack of vaccination. In Germany, it was the Star of David. Each of these symbols were backed by propaganda to instill fear, distrust and disgust in the in group, aimed at the out group.</li>
<li>⁠Discrimination. THIS is where the IBM passports really come in. We’ve seen airlines, universities, corporations, stadiums, etc etc, and now STATES, require vaccine papers to have access to their services. Now in California and Oregon, companies are required to report all their employees vaccination status, as well as their customers.</li>
</ol>
<p>On April 12, 1933, the German government announced plans to conduct a long-delayed national census. The project was particularly important to the Nazis as a mechanism for the identification of Jews, Gypsies, and other ethnic groups deemed undesirable by the regime. The 1933 census, with design help and tabulation services provided by IBM through its German subsidiary, proved to be pivotal to the Nazis in their efforts to identify, isolate, and ultimately destroy the country's Jewish minority. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_and_the_Holocaust</p>
<p>Now, IBM is branding this technology as a Digital Health Pass. “Digital Health Pass is designed to enable businesses to verify health credentials for employees, customers, fans and travelers entering their site based on their own criteria.” It’s tied into Travel and Transportation, Employers, Public Health, etc. They claim a decentralized data collection structure, but even if that’s true, it provides a direct means for a centralized structure to gather said data. https://www.ibm.com/products/digital-health-pass</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Dehumanization. From what I can tell, the plan was to get the vaccinated population up to 90%, and then ramp up the psycop to scapegoat the FUCK out of the “anti maskers”, making it a norm to consider them Neanderthals, disgusting filth, and subhuman. I think we’ve already seen the seeds being planted for that, and I sure as hell have seen people consider us that way. Jews were scapegoated to be the reason for the loss of WW1, and the secret force trying to undermine Germany’s spirit of nationalism. There was hyper inflation, the entire nation was expecting some sort of revolution, and the public latched onto this explanatory narrative of why they were screwed over in the Treaty of Versailles and why they were “defeated from within”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organization. Interestingly enough, despite having arguably the best military in the world, our Pentagon felt the need to construct a secret army of 60,000 around the world. Canada is a whole other beast. Trudeau is so fucked up with his lockdowns, camps, and now censorship. All around the world we see countries moving in a staggered lockstep, and it’s pretty identical to Operation Lockstep and the Kissinger Report. https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/pentagon-secret-army-soliders-congress-b1849963.html?amp</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polarization. The Nazis used the newspaper Der Stürmer to spread hate pointed at the Jews. Our technocracy is far more vast and comprehensive than that, and like I’ve said, we’ve already begun to see eerily similar propaganda techniques used. I think this is really all we’ve seen so far, but the rest of the steps are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preparation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persecution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extermination. (Side note: Germany kept it under wraps using “the Final Solution” as a sort of code phrase. Guess what Bill Gates, someone who I’m sure isn’t casual about the words he uses, called the vaccines....)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Denial</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, beyond the scope of the steps of genocide, I saw a comment somewhere in this sub describing other ways the globalist ideology is Nazism revamped. If I had their name I’d give them credit but I didn’t ss their username. This might make more sense if you familiarize yourself with Klaus Shwab’s “Covid-19 The Great Reset” book, free on google. This is his ideology and plan laid out in full detail</p>
<ol>
<li>⁠Go around racially scapegoating people while insisting their model of efficiency and environmentalism is so superior, that they have moral authority to simply decimate existing cultures and businesses and small-medium businesses and commerce</li>
<li>⁠Efficiency is the SAME EXACT justification the Nazis were using for half their atrocities, along with safety.</li>
<li>⁠They are moderately socialist. UBI is socialism lite, just like Nazism featured socialism-lite for its time. “National Socialist Workers Party.” This becomes state capitalism (in their plan global stakeholder capitalism), a fully planned economy with regulations on things like property, rent, vehicles, and so on which we are seeing technocrats demanding. “You’ll own nothing and you’ll be happy. By 2030, you may be able to just rent everything”. CDC can institute rent moratoriums, for instance!?</li>
<li>⁠Absurd Totalitarian bureaucracy with secret police and harsh swift cancellation of dissents. Canada is badddd for this rn. FBI and CIA here in the US are now fully politicized entities with no one to answer to, no accountability, nothing. It’s truly incredible what the FBI has been up to lately, I can’t believe this is America.</li>
<li>⁠Anti free speech, association, etc. love seeing the first amendment getting chiseled off some DC building last week.</li>
<li>⁠Justify human experimentation with murky emotional appeals to “the greater good”</li>
<li>⁠Claim to represent the only possible way to appreciate the environment and nature.</li>
<li>⁠Incredible mastery of propaganda, especially racialized propaganda designed to enflame racial tensions and create ideological factions. This shit is all the way into our US public school system now, with CRT being passed as virtuous and suitable for 1st grade classrooms. The media enflamed our nation so bad in 2020, forming larger factions on both sides</li>
<li>⁠Utilize experts and academics to make pseudo scientific justification for subjectively beneficial political and social goals.</li>
<li>⁠Call all opposition various forms of subhuman, often creating medial designations for their opponents, or using mental health/ social shaming to quell valid criticism and dissent.</li>
</ol>
<p>These globalists, the members of the Bilderberg Group, WEF, BG foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, our CIA and FBI, think they’re entitled to take the role of social and global architect, just like Hitlers punk ass. Hitler literally wanted to be an artist, but went into politics bc he saw it as an opportunity to be a social and political artist/ architect. Look what happened. When people are allowed to play God, they kill a lot of people.</p></p>
