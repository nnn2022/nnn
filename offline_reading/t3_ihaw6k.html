    <strong>My experience seeing doomers turn to skeptics</strong>
    <p><p>I have a few examples at this point of seeing doomers morph into at least light-skeptics and it’s been interesting to observe their journey from being super unhinged about the virus to basically losing their minds from isolation and security theater and deciding they’ll take their chances with the virus:</p>
<p>One of my friends lives alone in SoCal and was hardcore on Newsom’s nuts about the lockdowns and masks. She has lamented several times about how hard it is to live alone and be isolated in such a way. She’s a big traveler and legitimately all of her friends live in other states. But her heels seemed so dug in. She was one of those who wouldn’t even go to the beach and was blaming other people for why the virus was spreading in LA and all that shit. She at least wasn’t hypocritical about the protests in May so that’s something but for the most part she was a big doomer. I didn’t talk to her much from March to now but she tweeted a picture of her at brunch at a restaurant over the weekend. I was surprised and decided to test the waters a bit. So I reached out and said “hey I’ll be in your neck of the woods in October. Would you like to do brunch?” I got an enthusiastic YES! So I figured she was chilling out somewhat. Today she tweeted that she was done with social distancing, doesn’t care if she gets the virus and is so isolated anyways that it won’t matter if she gets the virus. So I think she probably cracked recently. I don’t feel good about isolation breaking her but I’m glad she came to her senses regardless of how she got to them. </p>
<p>My roommates are all varying levels of doomer. Over the months, they’ve lightened up in many ways but I imagined a party was far off. Well yesterday they were talking full speed ahead for a Halloween party with all our friends. I was shocked but didn’t say anything. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s to just let the fear end without fanfare and encourage whatever they’re excited about doing. So it’s nice to have a Halloween to look forward to that’s basically going to be normal! </p>
<p>Practically everyone I know has decided to take a vacation in September and October. </p>
<p>Everyone’s situation is different and I’m sure my experience isn’t everyone’s annnnd I know people say the tide isn’t turning but in large swaths of the US, despite governments trying to double down, people are just completely fucking off with it. And it makes me really happy to see!</p></p>

        <p>She likely thought this shit would be over by now and simply got fed up with putting her life on hold. Good for her. </p>
<p>I live in LA too and I really wish more people would wake the fuck up here.</p>

        <p>Same.  I was looking forward to Labor day weekend but they are already talking about fucking that up with beach and trail closures if people are "naughty" in LA  But in OC they will be cool, there's no way the Sheriff will enforce beach closures.</p>

        <p>The only times they realize it's all bs is when they get impacted.</p>
<p>So I don't feel bad that people get fucked up by their own bad choices.</p>
