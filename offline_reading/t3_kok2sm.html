    <strong>"Truth" is subjective</strong>
    <p><p>I know this will get a lot of flak, but truth is the most subjective notion out there. Everyone has their own perceptions of it. One person may think one thing as fact or "truth", and another might think it's complete malarkey but hold their opinions as truth.</p>
<p>Example,</p>
<p>I think masks and lockdowns are heavily unnecessary, yet doomers think they are absolutely the only way to deal with spreading germs. We think doomers are crazy, brainwashed egotistical, selfish jerks and they think the same of us.</p>
<p>I realized we are both fighting for the same end goal, but we don't agree on how to achieve it. Barring the crazy extremists the end goal is freedom and resuming our social lives. We want to do it by keeping life as normal as possible, doomers want to achieve it by following The Science™ and locking and shutting everything down.</p>
<p>They perceive The Science™ as absolute truth (dangerous) and we see right through it with truths of our own. Getting people indoctrinated in fear and self-virtued truth to change is a massive undertaking and requires some level of empathy and compassion on both sides.</p>
<p>We are divided by all things media, religion and politics. It's time we all come together as one group, regardless of flaws, uniqueness and differences we hold. It's the only true way to get out of this mess we let our politicians put us in.</p>
<p>EDIT: adding my reply about fact v truth</p>
<p>There are facts and there are truths. They are both extremely similar with some nuance.</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<p>These are constants where something undeniably exists and is based in reality. Like you said "if you stop drinking water you will die because it is vital for life" is a fact not a truth. Facts have permanence, like gravity is -9.8m/s², or the earth revolves around the sun, or everyone will die one day.</p>
<p>On the other hand let's talk about truth:</p>
<p>Truths are stateful, and deal with the moment. Example, if someone says they are eating pizza, it may be true at that point in time, but will become false the moment they stop eating pizza. Truths may be valid for one person but not valid for everyone.</p>
<p>Truth deals with one's beliefs and feelings where facts do not. Facts are accepted realities and constants nobody disagrees with (like your water statement)</p>
<p>It's a tough concept to wrap anyone's head around. Believe me I had a hell of time differentiating for a long time, but knowing the difference is key.</p></p>

        <p>Data and statistics are objective truth but is used to make biased and subjective conclusions. Public policy can ignore or use data that fits their goal.</p>
<p>Because of that, science is becoming more politically and agenda driven and less truth seeking.</p>

        <p>There are some things that are objectively true though. In the case for covid some examples are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>COVID is a airborne contagious virus that has a mortality rate of around 1.5%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thousands of people are dying everyday of COVID in the US.</p>

<li>
<p>Safety measures like face coverings and physical distancing have been proven to slow the spread of the disease significantly.</p>

        <p>Bro that 1.5% mortality ratio is the case fatality rate. Read up on IFR. That’s the only number you should care about.</p>
<p>Also regarding the CDC position on masking “Data regarding the “real-world” effectiveness of community masking are limited to observational and epidemiological studies.”</p>
<p>There is no “proof” in an observational study. This is poor quality data. You need a randomized controlled trial. Which multiple have been done for flu and now coronavirus, and none have shown benefit.</p>

        <p>Yes it is the case fatality rate. As in if 200 people contract covid, 3 of them will die because of it. So this year in the US 20 million people contracted the virus, and 346,000 Americans died of it.</p>

<p>You are literally ignoring every case that occurs, but is not tested for or detected. </p>
<p>Here’s the most recent CDC numbers for how many people have ACTUALLY been infected, not just tested positive. The 95% confidence interval is 77.8-102 million people have been infected, not 20 million. </p>

<p>No, what you just described is the <em>Infection</em> Fatality Rate (IFR), not the <em>Case</em> Fatality Rate (CFR).  HUUUUGE difference.  The IFR for COVID, across all age groups, is 0.23%, per the CDC.</p>
<p>You really need to spend some time educating yourself before you try and start preaching at other people.  You don't know what you're talking about.</p>

        <p>Why does it not work? The virus is in water droplets in your breath. A mask prevents those droplets from travelling far as it acts as a barrier meaning less people are likely to breathe those droplets in and less surfaces will become contaminated. Unless using certain types of masks, it won't prevent you from catching covid but it certainly can slow the spread. Can you explain why they don't work?</p>

        <p>This is not how viruses work. They are aerosolized and your mask is invisible to aerosolized viruses - that's what "airborne" means. </p>
<p>They don't "slow the spread". They're utterly useless.</p>
<p>This has been confirmed by the literature both in terms of a review on all mask-viral transmission studies and the Danish study on coronavirus transmission and masks.</p>
<p>This is basic physics and masks work is the biggest lie of 2020 bar none.</p>

<p>This gives a good comparison of covid compared to normal seasonal flu. It's clear that covid is much more dangerous. What worries me are the long term health issues that patients are left with. 
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02598-6 </p>
<p>1.5% sounds low, and it could be even lower as we have no idea how many people have contracted it, but in the grand scheme of things 1.5% of the world population is 112,500,000 which is a huge number. I feel if we can help prevent death, we should do it. </p>
<p>In the beginning, i was very sceptical and thought everyone was over reacting but as time went on and more info came out, i realised it is much more serious.</p>

        <p>I agree covid is more dangerous than seasonal flu. But the IFR is definitely without a doubt not 1.5%. </p>
<p>Just look at how many suspected infections there have been in the US according to the CDC: then do the math. Hint: 78-107 million infections. </p>

        <p>Also that lancet article you are giving me is giving the mortality rate of hospitalized patients, only. I know the in hospital mortality for influenza is comparatively low. </p>

        <p>So what? The average age of the dead is a year older than that of the average age of the dead in the population. The flu kills young people, this takes people who were dying. Obese, octagenarians with 2.4 comorbidities - the excess deaths this year (despite the propaganda around them) are next to zero. The people who died "with" Covid were going to die anyway. This is how life works. Old people die. Why are you so worried about that?</p>

        <p>Clara- I know covid is worse than seasonal flu. I think it’s about 3 times as bad. But that’s not a reason to completely shut down society. Our medical system can cope with a temporary increase in patients. </p>
<p>Meanwhile young people are dying in record numbers from suicide and elderly of neglect. And our children are not in school- this is NOT ok!</p>
<p>This is due to our over-exaggerated draconian response- not due to covid. </p>
<p>I think things will get better quickly now that we have a vaccine- but we have to mitigate the damage we are doing to society in the meantime.</p>

        <p>This. Truth is never subjective. Opinions are subjective.</p>
<p>The sky is either up or it is not. Gravity makes things fall down or it does not.</p>
<p>There's no grey area in truth.  Subjectivity is the sales pitch of the coronacowards (OK, there's no evidence that masks work, so, let's just do it anyway). </p>
<p>Factually, this is a bad cold. Factually, people die "of" illnesses except for Covid-19 where they die "with" it. Factually, there is no evidence that masks work. Factually, there is no evidence that social distancing is effective. Factually, not only were lockdowns not recommended by science but there is no evidence of their efficacy. Factually, there is little (if any) excess mortality in 2020. Factually, vaccines and new medicines are supposed to be tested for 10 years before being brought to market. Factually, people die, they always have and they always will. </p>
<p>None of this is subjective.</p>

        <p>There are facts and there are truths. They are both extremely similar with some nuance.</p>
<p>Facts:</p>
<p>These are constants where something undeniably exists and is based in reality. Like you said "if you stop drinking water you will die because it is vital for life" is a fact not a truth. Facts have permanence, like gravity is -9.8m/s², or the earth revolves around the sun, or everyone will die one day.</p>
<p>On the other hand let's talk about truth:</p>
<p>Truths are stateful, and deal with the moment. Example, if someone says they are eating pizza, it may be true at that point in time, but will become false the moment they stop eating pizza. Truths may be valid for one person but not valid for everyone.</p>
<p>Truth deals with one's beliefs and feelings where facts do not. Facts are accepted realities and constants nobody disagrees with (like your water statement)</p>
<p>It's a tough concept to wrap anyone's head around. Believe me I had a hell of time differentiating for a long time, but knowing the difference is key.</p>
