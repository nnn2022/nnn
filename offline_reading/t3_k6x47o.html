    <strong>Rationale for mass vaccination may not make sense.</strong>
    <p><p>There is very limited information available regarding the desired  'end point' of vaccination, to which vaccine efficacy is benchmarked. I believe that the criterion for 'success' is the reduction of Covid 19 symptoms and does not infer or require immunity to infection with sars cov-2, nor does it mean that vaccinated individuals will not develop covid 19 symptoms.</p>
<p>On the basis of the above, it is implicit that vaccinated individuals may contract sars cov-2 and may also develop covid 19 symptoms. It then a corollary of these assumptions that vaccinated individuals may also transmit sars co-2 / covid 19 to the general population, [edit. i.e., infect others]. Vaccine passports / microchips / or whatever, may permit vaccinees to spread the contagion around communities.</p>
<p>With the above rather empiric argument, it would seem that the only logical solution is to only immunise the elderly and vulnerable, as vaccination does not stop vaccinees from spreading the contagion.</p>
<p>The above would also mean that a vaccine could not reasonably be expected to confer herd immunity; why then are the ptb suggesting that we need to attain circa 70% vaccination to establish herd immunity.</p>
<p>Sometimes the elephant in the room is right in front of one's face.</p>
<p>Edit, The final and most intriguing question and the one that alarms me the most: Why would the ptb want to vaccinate a population with a vaccine that does not confer immunity from infection from sars cov2? To put it another way, why would the ptb want the populace to become infected with sarsa cov 2 following a vaccination that may modify the immune response to sars cov2? {see ADE)</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p></p>

        <p>The plandemic is simple once I did research (still scary). It's a human chemical sterilizer that confuses a womans reproductive system into infertility (no getting pregnant).</p>

        <p>whatever this concoction is, it is not a 'vaccine'</p>
<p>there has never been a vaxx for any corona virus after 60+ years of effort. </p>
<p>the corona is a common cold virus, and it is not possible to achieve 'herd immunity' from the common cold, which is notably called 'common' for a reason.</p>
<p>hell, there is no a medical diagnostic test for the corona, like they do for the various flu viruses</p>
