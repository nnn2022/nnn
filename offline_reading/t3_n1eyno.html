    <strong>Database to compile information</strong>
    <p><p>Having been looking around the sub for a while, I noticed that the amount of information people post, from news articles to scientific journal to reminders of old ludicrous claims that were proven wrong by time, is considerable to say the least. Is there a database I could use somehow where such information would be compiled by topic? </p>
<p>Is there a place that brings together the several articles from places like Stanford, Toulouse, MIT and many others exposing the inefficacy of the lockdowns for example? If there isn't, do you think that maybe it would be important for this sub to organize something, especially considering that so much of this genuinely good information gets thrown under the rug by the faucist media who wants us to just forget about it? </p>
<p>I think about this for he who controls the past controls the future.</p></p>
