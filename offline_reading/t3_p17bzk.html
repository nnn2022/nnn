        <p>DOJ should be disbanded with states managing their own department of justice and court system. SCOTUS should still exist but reformed.</p>
<p>The DOJ is just too rotten to be saved.</p>

        <p>If what is in the contracts that Pfizer makes countries sign is true then the the world governments who are under contract basically have to fight tooth and nail with all of their agencies to defend the vaccines.</p>

        <p>I don't think judges have any backbone or integrity they would have done this if Biden called them and told them to strike down passport bans. It's a shame because if that's true, and it wouldn't be surprising, then refusing to enforce the contract would force Pfizer to reveal the terms with a lawsuit and then it's over for them.</p>

        <p>No matter what happens Pfizer gets the ultimate victory. Laws that state people can go after them are voided or changed. If people go after them the government has to fund their fees including losses and lawyer fees. If Pfizer has to pay anything out of their pocket the government is forced to reimburse them. In fairness I haven't read many contracts like that so I am by no means an expert but it does strike me as alarming that the government would give up every piece of authority to a pharmaceutical company. It strikes me as regulatory capture.</p>

        <p>&rt; He has argued that Florida law prevents discrimination and protects privacy
&rt; by preventing businesses, schools or governments from demanding proof of
&rt; immunity in return for service.</p>
<p>&rt; Norwegian has said the law was not about protecting passengers but
&rt; scoring political points.</p>
<p>How does a law that protects personal liberties and one's privacy, about scoring political points? If the law were about scoring political points, it would've been written in a manner which would've given an advantage of some kind to those of the same, or similar, political beliefs that DeSantis possesses. Yet, the law was written in the most philosophically neutral way that no one of any kind of political beliefs, would have any kind of advantage over their counterparts. This is how laws should be ideally written as to avoid being assumed as political.</p>
<p>&rt; Norwegian said the law violates the company's First Amendment right to
&rt; interact with customers and does not prevent discrimination because the
&rt; company would have to segregate and mask passengers who declined to
&rt; prove they were vaccinated.</p>
<p>The law doesn't enforce this policy. This policy, would've most likely been the the company's own policy of refusing to adhere to the Florida law. It couldn't get its way, so it created a <strong>company policy</strong> to separate passengers based upon their vaccination statues. This policy doesn't have an equivalent justification  within the Florida law.</p>
<p>&rt; The state argued that Norwegian could have opted, as rival cruise operators
&rt; did, to seek CDC approval through a process of running simulated voyages
&rt; and applying other COVID-19 protocols such as masking indoors.</p>
<p>This is how Florida still manages to look out for everyone, while protecting their personal and privacy: By offering an alternative safety program that makes the requiring of vaccination records, needless, while still allowing a business to operate freely at its fullest potential.</p>
