    <strong>People's reaction to the Wuhan NYE video is mindblowing</strong>
    <p><p>Maybe it's just a propaganda video, regardless, to see so many people praise china's response to covid and thinking they got it under control in order for thousands to celebrate new years on the streets is insane to me. They really think that the draconian measures we saw on the internet in January is what success looks like...</p>
<p>Do people actually think china has 80,000 cases still? The virus spread to every corner of the globe, but meanwhile beijing, shanghai, guangzhou who have hundreds of flights to wuhan every day are spared with just a couple thousand cases??? What is even going on with the world. Can people not critically analyze data , or do they just not care to?</p>
<p>China doesn't have the virus under control, they're just ignoring it and moving on.</p></p>

<p>Both, I think. They have no idea how to analyze data, and don't care to do it either, opting to just listen to their peers and the "experts" instead.</p>

        <p>The data is fake, always has been. I trust China more than CNN, to be honest, though maybe it's all one hidden world government. A couple of looks at those "interactive maps" we used to have make this super obvious. Just people trying to keep up with each other and so on, kind of like face-book. And then those political and financial interests came into play.</p>
