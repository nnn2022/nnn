    <strong>The ILLUSION of safety</strong>

<p>This ties in with UN's Agenda 30 as in 2019, the World Economic Forum signed a strategic partnership with the UN which smoothly moves on to my next link..</p>

<p>Extract from the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>The UN-Forum Partnership was signed in a meeting held at United Nations headquarters between UN Secretary-General António Guterres and World Economic Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab to <strong>accelerate</strong> the implementation of the <strong>2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</strong></li>
<li>The partnership identifies six areas of focus – <strong>financing the 2030 Agenda</strong>, climate change, health, digital cooperation, gender equality and empowerment of women, education and skills – to strengthen and broaden their combined impact by building on existing and new collaborations</li>
</ul>

<p>Klaus Schwab mentioned in his book, COVID 19 - The Great Reset that lockdowns have shown how humans are able to "adapt" to certain scenarios, very quickly. I believe it's a tactic that may be used over in the future.</p>
<p>I do firmly believe that lockdowns are a social experiment in order to test their sustainable agenda. Less consumption from the public, less choice on the types of stores they can purchase from, the abolition of private ownership. Everything will be a service. Ownership of transport or a car? Nope. Rent a scooter. Hire a driverless car.</p>
<p>You can call it a conspiracy theory or you can accuse me of taking it out of context, that;'s fine. I believe the pandemic presented a great opporunity for the people in power to enact and further their "sustainable" agendas. Since when we do lockdown the majority of the population when the hospitals are slightly close to being overwhelmed? In the UK, the hospitals are overwhelmed every single winter.</p>
<p>Do you think people would accept such change in their life without fear? Would they be able to enact their agendas without a little authoritarian control?</p>
<p>When a populace lives in fear, those in power can force what they want. Citizens will comply due to the illusion of government security.. Safety and secuity comes at a cost. Your liberty. It's actually a tactic the nazis used.</p>

<p>"The Nazis crushed opposition through legal moves, <strong>fear and intimidation.</strong> <strong>Propaganda</strong> and social control kept the <strong>population in line</strong>. Popular economic and foreign policies encouraged widespread support."</p>

<p>Above is an image from the latest round of British propanda. You are now essentially a murderer if you do not stay home. Powerful imagery. And it turns the populace against each other. Divide and conquer. Another known technique in the control arsenal.</p>
<p>In regards to your last point. We are already being surveiled. We have been for a long time. That ship has sailed. Of course, in order to keep you safe from those pesky terrorists!</p>
