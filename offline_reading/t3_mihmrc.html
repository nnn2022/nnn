    <strong>Best friend just survived the deadliest disease known to man</strong>
    <p><p>But he's quite a strong fella. He was sick with a fever for 7 days, coughing and in bed. He's better now though. Even invited me out for a beer - except that he is under house arrest.</p>
<p>The government put him in quarantine for 14 days, made him install an app on his phone to track his movements and are sending police to his home every day.</p>
<p>Thank goodness we're being all watched over and kept safe by our caring, loving governments.</p></p>
