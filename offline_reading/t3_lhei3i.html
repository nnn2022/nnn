    <strong>Death From Vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve been skeptical to believe the stories here and there about deaths from the COVID vaccine, because I know that there are people on the internet that lie or could be possibly trying to falsely blame the vaccine for a potentially unrelated death. I need more proof, a large and viable compilation of very sudden deaths after receiving it. I at least have seen firsthand that the COVID narrative has been exaggerated beyond measure, but the vaccine is still too recent. However, my 13 yr old sister came home from school today and told my mother that her friend in class’ mom had 5 friends that died right after getting the vaccine. She doesn’t really have much awareness of the incredibly polarizing politics surrounding the issue nor has she ever expressed any resentment for the lockdowns or the fact she has to wear a mask every day at school… I don’t think her or her other 13 year old friend would care to invent something like that but they are children.</p>
<p>Has anyone else heard of friends or family recently passing suddenly after being administered the vaccine?</p>
<p>Obviously I can’t trust any major news media to honestly report deaths related to it so I’m just curious to find personal anecdotes on this sub (or trustworthy links you have saved) since our own discourse here is still not censored, thankfully.</p>
<p>And if it becomes a trend, fuck… I mean I’ve always had extreme distrust in gov and I have my “conspiracies” (logical deductions) that COVID’s severity is a global hoax and that it was highly likely lab-created but the implications of this possibility are FAR darker and sobering.</p></p>

        <p>You should just do your own search on VAERS and read the descriptions of deaths following the shot. They haven’t even all been reported yet and there’s hundreds. You can be criminally charged for filing a false report and they usually say if they are coming from an individual or a health professional.</p>

        <p>I live in a rural town in the Midwest. I don’t know anyone that is for or wants the vaccine so let alone know anyone that has even taken it. But I have seen a few people I follow post this <a href="https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data">site. </a> I just saved it for now. Haven’t had time to fully check it or it’s credibility out.</p>

        <p>Looks like prezi requires log in now ugh. There were many collected screengrabs and videos there with anecdotal evidence of how bad the shots are.</p>
