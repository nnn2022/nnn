    <strong>I cannot believe women are undermining menstruation issues tied to the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>I cannot believe any women would sacrifice her menstruation process for this experimental vaccine. Yes, periods are horrible but necessary for the health and vitality of women. Let me explain.</p>
<p>I have PCOS and only 1 fallopian tube. Because of this, I have irregular periods. When my periods are off, it means I am not healthy at the moment. Simple as that.</p>
<p>In order to regulate my periods, I need to reduce stress, eat Keto, and really, really listen to my body. I don't take any pills. It works. </p>
<p>The doctor told me missing periods or menstruation issues can lead to cancer over time. It can lead to other serious issues, too. </p>
<p>Further, menstruation is clearly about fertility. I cannot believe all of these women are sacrificing the chance to have a child for a shot.</p>
<p>After losing 2 babies, I know the value of life. I now luckily have my son because my periods regulated and I took care of my body. </p>
<p>I cannot believe these women are so stupid. I cannot believe they would take a vaccine while pregnant either! Does anybody remember the thalidomide tragedy?</p>
<p>https://helix.northwestern.edu/article/thalidomide-tragedy-lessons-drug-safety-and-regulation</p>
<p>All of it is all sort of funny. During my pregnancy I saw women FREAK out about eating sushi or drinking a little coffee. But an experimental vaccine? No problem!</p></p>

        <p>A woman I know just had her 4th baby. She got the mRNA injections in the late 2nd trimester/early 3rd trimester. She doesn't question what health officials say, so she never questioned the safety of the shots. Luckily, her baby seems healthy, but she mentioned his birth weight was by far the lowest of all her babies. Of course she didn't suspect the Covid shots. I suspect them, but I didn't say anything.</p>

        <p>How the fuck is anyone justifying giving this to pregnant women? They always say never to do that unless the drug has specifically been tested on pregnant women and found to be safe.  Guess gene therapy is ok... /s</p>

        <p>I had a mini debate with a scientist involved in drug development (incredibly biased dude of course), over the risk of the jabs and he claimed the Thalidomide event was not to be compared to these jabs, as “it was so long ago and we scientists know so much more about things now”. I quit responding at that point as they are so arrogant in thinking they understand what their products do to the body enough to prevent future harm- just because more time has gone by and they have fancier equipment. This last year has shown us how much these so called experts- don’t know. Much of the beliefs in science are based off of theory and we can see how many times since Thalidomide, that people have been harmed from products created in labs- where they apparently “know so much more” to avoid any bodily damage being done. </p>
<p>They’ve not improved on creating less dangerous products- the manufacturers have just gotten better at hiding the outcomes thanks to the politicization of science and the religion of scientism keeping the cult in line.</p>

<p>It was withdrawn in 2004.  One of the biggest drug settlements ever was paid out in 2006. </p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rofecoxib</p>
<p>&rt; In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, allegedly resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease.[3] Rofecoxib was one of the most widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn from the market. In the year before withdrawal, Merck had sales revenue of US$2.5 billion from Vioxx.[4]</p>

        <p>I too, am utterly shocked at the dismissal of these issues. On a friend's instagram, she posted a doctor's message to her directly regarding missing menstrual cycles. The doctor advised her it's not a side effect and is completely normal to have irregular periods. We've been close friends for many years and that girl doesn't miss periods, unless something is wrong. She published this to her 10k+ followers and they all took a comfortable breath. I spent time with her right after vaccination (despite my efforts in asking her to wait since she ALREADY HAD COVID) and my cycle was off, MIA and I had horrendous period cramps for days. I have 0 issues with my lady bits and they've always been healthy and normal. Wtf is going on?! </p>
<p>The WHO can't make recommendations on vaccinating children since we don't have enough evidence/data...but they're going to jab every pregnant women who's willing and every child they can find.</p>

        <p>25 year old male here: my parents got their second shots Monday, and on Tuesday I had chest pain. Thankfully I'll be moving out in a week, but I've never had it before, been in good shape my entire life, and so it's fairly concerning. I'm not sure what it is, but timing wise it's quite suspicious, especially since there's apparently a known risk of heart issues with people in my demographic...</p>

        <p>I am not sure that they even tracked this in the trials.  And if there is some kind of hormonal disruption going on, couldn’t it interfere with the efficacy of hormonal birth control?  Are they even keeping track of people who are trying to conceive but can’t or conversely those on hormonal birth control who nonetheless became pregnant?</p>

        <p>In the original trials before the vaccines were approved for use I don't believe there were any pregnant women in the trials so they didn't have the data on that and in their original write up they said they have insufficient evidence for use on pregnant women and children. It was only later the governments said it was okay, based on what evidence? I don't know. Basically a wait and see mentality, but at least the drug companies can't be sued if anything happens!</p>

        <p>Source: I worked in a medical setting doing research for a while.</p>
<p>Usually, in scientific studies, the first focus is on men and women on birth control. You really, seriously don't want any of your subjects getting pregnant, because pregnancy causes all sorts of issues, both ethically and scientifically.</p>
<p>Ethically, it's dangerous because lots of things are safe for adults, or even children, but wreak havoc on fetal development, and the child did not consent to be in the study, so you don't expose them to it unless you're very confident it's either safe or necessary; and scientifically there are issues because pregnancy results in dramatic and rapid physiological changes in the mother, and these are not consistent from pregnancy to pregnancy.</p>
<p>This means that women who could end up pregnant during a study are usually excluded, and quite often a condition of joining a study is taking birth control, so as to minimize the risks of an accidental and unplanned pregnancy. Which means that in all likelihood, until we started inoculating the general public, we had no data on what it does to women who are menstruating, pregnant, or lactating.</p>

        <p>Apparently prepubescent girls and post menopausal women sometimes end up having periods if they spend time around people who took the vaccines. I haven't been able to confirm it, but it leads to a true nightmare scenario: what if they are fertile? What if a large number of very young and very old women are going to end up getting pregnant?</p>

<p>That's that dumbest comment I've ever read in a forum. You do realize biology is an essential study to become a licensed physician? Biological principals and theories are related to the study of diseases such as covid-19. I think you're also confusing biology with marine biology which is an entirely different study but uses the same principals</p>
<p>&rt;That would make you exactly as qualified as I am to decide for myself what is legitimate or illegitimate information.</p>
<p>Not really. I have a thorough understanding of pathology and pathophysiology, something That even a marine biologist can comprehend when reviewing studies related to pathogenic viruses like SARS-CoV-2. </p>
<p>If you want to have a discussion, I'd be more than happy to review your data. If you want to try and invalidate my knowledge based on my education, then you're just grasping straws while trying to deflect and avoiding the topic.</p>

        <p>What’s your degree? And peer review is a fairly recent development in the science ‘community’ that now largely only exists for publishers to make money, unnecessarily politicizes/gatekeeps science, and it’s value is overstated.</p>

        <p>&rt;During my pregnancy I saw women FREAK out about eating sushi or drinking a little coffee</p>
<p>Great point. I've been pregnant twice, and remember being told to avoid so many things. When I had terrible heartburn for the last trimester (both times) that made me cough so hard I puked...oh yeah, and I was hospitalized for HG...the basic consensus was "we're not going to give you anything, just suffer through, because it might not be safe for the baby". </p>
<p>But now that's all out the window! Thalidomide? Never happened!</p>

        <p>I highly recommend charting (check out the book "Taking Charge of Your Fertility")--I started a few years ago, and its yielded more information than any doctor ever has. All these women are brushing off missed periods, late periods, EARLY periods by TWO WEEKS, but don't have the slightest clue as to what exactly is happening in their bodies. Is your basal temperature out of whack? Did you stop ovulating? Did your luteal phase get really short or really long? Why do they not care??</p>

        <p>It's so sad. This is going to sound crazy, but I feel the last few years, many people have lost touch with what their bodies are telling them (on our phones too much, pharmaceuticals being pushed for every minor ailment). If I miss a period, which usually happens when I'm really stressed or sick, I know something is off and I need to pay attention. My periods are already incredibly painful, so why would I want to make them worse? I've never even taken birth control because I don't want to mess with my hormones. </p>
<p>Also, did they ever think that women on birth control might be more likely to have blood clots with the shots because birth control already puts women at higher risk for that?</p>

        <p>Honestly I feel bad for the pregnant women who took the vaccine based on data that was generalized to include them. They didn't include pregnant women in the initial trials.</p>
<p>It's amazing to me that there's enough time to see that transplant recipients don't benefit from the vaccine (they should take it several times, just in case tho), to start trials on teens, and now kids, but there isn't time to keep up with vaers reports.</p>

        <p>The inclusion of female mice resulted in huge error bars and no statistical significance. When they removed the female mice from the data sets, the error bars decreased and resulted in statistically significant difference between wildtype mice (control) and test mice. Some groups don’t even bother testing female mice anymore, since they want to be able to publish results and get more of that sweet NIH grant money (and save time and money). I’ve argued that both male and female should be tested to make any finding legitimate, but I can’t force anyone to do it, I can only point it out and then become unpopular. But you should “believe science!”</p>

        <p>My mom called yesterday to chat. Mentioned that she saw her gynecologist on Monday for a biopsy follow-up, and casually asked if she had noticed miscarriages and missing periods becoming more frequent.
The gyno said she hadn’t noticed an increase in miscarriages, but did admit to a big increase in menstrual irregularities, and even admitted it was likely due to the vaccine. But then proceeded to shrug it off and glibly say “yeah, that’s just how it’s gonna be”.
Mind blowing.</p>
