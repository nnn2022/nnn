<p>&rt;That behavior in the video puts the "group of dudes" in the same category as the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hy6ttr/excerpt_from_they_thought_they_were_free/">Nazi Youth Groups</a> - basically getting yourselves a license to bully and harass other people in the name of "scientism" not of "science" (<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hosvhw/an_updated_critique_of_the_twopronged_idea_that_a/">there's a big difference</a>). You are not heroes, you are fomenting social division and turning people against one another. This should be called for what it is - hate crime.</p>

        <p>They are the inevitable fallout of these policies. It should never have been any mystery or surprise that these things were going to happen. Reprehensible and disgusting yes, but IMO the lion's share of blame should be borne by those who have perpetuated these schemes all around the world. It hasn't been innoccuous incompetence. These people do NOT have the best interest of the population at heart, they know EXACTLY what they're doing. In their vision of the not so distant future, people are little more than livestock, property of the global medical dictatorship (or medical "technocracy" as some have called it).</p>
<p>World Economic Forum's "The Great Reset", along with United Nations Agenda 2030 and all of the blatant statements made by people like Tedros, Fauci and Gates throughout this thing have made it absolutely crystal clear what their intentions are. It's no "conspiracy theory" when they literally tell you exactly what they're doing but just no one listens because it didn't come from CNN or their government leader in an overt announcement.</p>

        <p>And I saw the fallout they did to that post in there (seriously, should I be surprised at how these people behave?).</p>
<p>And I bet you at least one of them will follow you here and whine and cry that you DID post here. Not caring how insecure that makes them look.</p>

        <p>These guys are morons. Look at them all right up on each other for their photo op. Guess they believe in masks but not social distancing. They might as well be hugging. These mandates arenâ€™t doing shit but hurting people.</p>

        <p>Wearing a mask doesn't keep others safe so its more about how its not my responsibility to practice their religion just to make them feel better</p>
