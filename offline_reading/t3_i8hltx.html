        <p>You’d have to start with someone who isn’t going to be obviously politically biased. This guy says kids don’t transmit the virus and that border crossings are responsible for the rise in southern states. </p>
<p>This isn’t anything but reinforcement for those hoping that they can make sense out of trumps response to the pandemic. He doesn’t even source any of his wild claims. That should tell you everything you need to know</p>

        <p>Both of those are true, though. Kids generally don't get it bad enough to really contribute to spreading in any signifigant way, and some hospitals near the border got close to capacity because of folks crossing over for better care.</p>

        <p>That’s not true at all. At all. You have no evidence for that. Just 10 people willing to upvote you for doing exactly what this dr did.</p>
<p>Here is a close enough idea to what we can expect from 0-10 and 11-19. 11-19 is the worst for spreaders, by the way. And Denmark found the highest viral load is 0-5. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/11/do-teenagers-spread-coronavirus-more-than-young-children</p>
<p>You also have no evidence that because it borders the south, it’s the problem. It has a lot to do with people who flocked to the south to pack into beaches as well as the protesting. Mostly to do with people who protest masks and distancing. </p>
<p>You just can’t be absolute about a virus we have such little research on.</p>

        <p>They are very true.</p>
<p>So many studies show kids don't seem to transmit it or get very ill.</p>
<p>Look at border states and their counties. Where are the ones with the biggest uptick? Look at California - we had so many people coming in from Mexico for treatment in Imperial County, their little hospitals got a bit messy.</p>
<p>It's a fucking coronavirus it isn't something BRAND NEW we've never encountered before, Jesus Christ.</p>

        <p>I'm not your mommy, I'm not going to google for you. Plenty from the UK, Sweden, Australia, US. I understand for people like you though data doesn't matter, only lockdowns and despair. Who cares about the real fatality rate or herd immunity percentage or the fact so many of us create T-cell responses to Covid? IT'S NOT LOCKDOWN IT DOESN'T EXIST</p>

        <p>Dude I just linked an article with several studies on the matter.</p>
<p>You guys call fauci a hack but trumps handpicked dr that agrees with him isn’t. And then you pretend I’m arguing in bad faith. I wish you knew how idiotic you looked so it would embarrass you into changing but I think you’d rather double down. </p>
<p>I truly didn’t know this was a trump circle jerk sub where trump approved crowds don’t cause a spread but protests and immigrants do. </p>
<p>I’ll look for nuanced debate somewhere else. My bad</p>

        <p>You are arguing in bad faith because you want this bullshit to continue and think this is a completely acceptable way to live and respond to a virus with a 0.26% fatality rate.</p>
<p>I am not a Trump supporter or voter. You are in bad faith when you automatically assume that anyone who is against cratering the western economy is some tinhat far-right weirdo. I am a conservative who left the GOP in 2016. Nice try. :-)</p>
<p>Spreading it is good. Why? It CREATES FUCKING HERD IMMUNITY. Look at New York, NJ, etc - herd immunity. Oh wait. Still imprisoned. Businesses destroyed. Museums destroyed. Permanent inequities due to education failures since apparently teachers are cowards but the dude at McDonalds isn't. We will lose so much but that's cool because lockdown forever. Also killed loads in nursing homes because who cares about them. Young people just aren't affected. <em>I</em> had it and I am not the poster child of health. <em>I</em> had swine flu. The latter was a billion times worse for me. Did we destroy the world over swine flu? Nope! Obama said wash your hands, practice hygiene. Good, that's what should have happened here, but we went fucking insane.</p>
<p>We did not behave this way during swine flu. This is not about public health - but power, and taking away our civil rights as human beings to assemble, practice our faith, LIVE, travel! It affects you, me, our children, our children's children, because those in power - INCLUDING TRUMP - will not give this up.</p>
<p>The only studies screaming about no school started because TRUMP TALKED ABOUT IT, because everything must be against Orange Man Bad (who I agree, is a shit president, but neither here nor there). This is about politics and power. You, sir, look like an idiot when you sit there screaming about Trump supporters when many, many here are centrists or leftists.</p>

        <p>Lmao. Herd immunity. That’s rich. We’ll just start that now after doing nothing for 8 months and 160,000 dead Americans. </p>
<p>I’m going to be reasonable and point out that you have exactly no credible evidence that this drs claims are worth a fuck which is all I said. Throwing stock into this idiot is posturing at best because there is no consensus. But this whole sub is convinced there’s a public health conspiracy. </p>
<p>No one distanced to destroy businesses. Those who kept spreading it did that. You can’t overrun hospitals, genius. At some point we had to play catch up and herd immunity wouldn’t have done shit with a president telling his die hard supporters it was nothing. </p>
<p>Too many ifs and buts and you’re too obsessed with being contrary that you now support trump political props. Not my fault you look like the dopes in his crowd.</p>
