    <strong>These vaccers demanding everyone be vaccinated are doing it because they don't want to be the only ones being screwed down the road.</strong>
    <p><p>If you get the vaccine then why the hell do you care about what I do and if I get the virus? It won't affect you or your vaccinated children. No, they are doing it as "insurance" because eventually, someone has to foot the bill paying for their medical care if/when 10 years down the road because of side effects or another virus kills a billion idiots that had their immune systems compromised. </p>
<p>These people will be the ones protesting on the streets demanding universal healthcare. While the pharma companies always get away with it. And I for one won't be footing your bill and will be laughing my ass off when these people are dying.</p>

        <p>The funny thing about the vaccine is they claim they got it to be a virtuous protector of others but we all know they got it because they’re scared as fuck of covid.</p>
<p>Soooooo many people are saying “fuck no” to this vaccine and the total conformists are the ones getting it, so no wonder they’re desperate to get everyone else to conform.</p>
<p>They can’t fathom someone not functioning in life like a total NPC like themselves.</p>

        <p>You are absolutely correct that this is what's going on in the minds of many of these people.</p>
<p>The average person has a questionable state of consciousness. They live in a state of hypnosis due to screen addiction. (We are all affected to some degree.)</p>
<p>Their decisions over the last year were made first in fear, and second due to politicization. The fear is obvious, but the politicization is why they hold on to these beliefs and this agenda even after the manipulation has become apparent.</p>
<p>At this point they are subconsciously mad that they complied and others didn't.</p>
<p>It takes a person with good self-esteem to recognize they were wrong, and even more self-esteem to admit it.  It's sad, because it's actually a RELIEF to just accept that you were wrong about something, learn from it, and move on.</p>

        <p>They want everyone in the same boat as them. It's like when a group of friends are all addicts and one gets clean. Then they stop talking to them cause they can't relate. People have a nature to wanna bring other people down to their level. And I think a lot of these people know what they've done was wreckless and may affect them negatively in the long run. The Johnson and Johnson little tid bit was the first warning sign that these things may not be as safe &amp; effective as advertised. Everyone got that info. Not just people who look deeper into shit.</p>

        <p>When you get vaccinated, it means you likely cannot get the virus, which means it won’t make you sick—and you won’t pass it onto anyone else. In addition to protecting yourself, the vaccine also helps the larger community. If there are fewer targets for the virus to jump to, fewer people will get sick. And that means there will be less chance for mutations and more virulent variants to develop.</p>

        <p>That's exactly what the experts are saying.  By it not preventing infection, it accepts evolutionary pressure on it's own propogation, rendering it more infectious over time.

Well, the difference between all-knowing you and the scientific world is that the scientists think they don’t know shit. Scientific approach is a tedious process of questioning everything through validating data and research. And it is very, very, very difficult to be certain about things you’re mentioning here.
But you’re smarter than this. And this sub knows the holy truth and it’s all very simple and logical, as any other conspiracy theory where the Earth is flat, Gates eats children, Australia is a hoax, jewish space lasers destroy forests, covid is hoax, 5g controls minds and viccines are bio-weapon made by lizards.

        <p>Pathogens mutate not because of vaccine pressure, but viral replication. Vaccines of course act as selection pressures. They steer evolution by selecting for, in our case, viral proteins unrecognized by immune systems which have received the vaccine.</p>
<p>But, overall, the more people are vaccinated, the fewer people become infected and so there will be fewer opportunities for mutations to occur during viral replication.</p>

        <p>You should look up “ADE”. Even fauci acted like he was concerned at the outset about ADE in any “vaccine”.</p>
