    <strong>Hey NoNewNormal, I'm asking for help internationally</strong>
    <p><p>I'm from Germany and as you may know, my nation really suffers from their own nazi past and the government &amp; media is selling this narrative to divide the nation and to fuel aggression.</p>
<p>Especially between the new formed "antifa", it's a fake 16y old lifestyle leftist mob and "conspiracy theorist/nazi people" (people like u and me on this sub basically).But it goes thru all generations/income classes. It's insane how well structured this pandemic is..phewww lol</p>
<p>I'm sure this problem is known in your country aswell (when I look to the US it's basically democrats&amp;republicans, France,Russia,...)</p>
<p>I just wanted to describe our situations in a few words above.So now, during this year, we organized in protest movements and demonstrations &amp;  it just simply isn't enough anymore - they're resistant to facts. Time to accelerate.</p>
<p>So now we need to reach people on an emotional, human level. Something that all our governments lack off. It's their weak spot and OUR strength.</p>
<p>We were thinking on how to reach those people who are just afraid to speak their truth due to the massive pressure they find themselves in. Who are not psyopted but prone to the narrative "I want to help", those who notice that something isn't right. They are the weakest link in their chain!</p>
<p>Think about.</p>
<p>We came to the conclusion, that we must reach further for help. We need to connect internationally to show the solidarity between all the nations &amp; speak our truth collectively. We need to LIVE tru connection and tru solidarity. We need to start getting connected to the protest movements internally before censorship and restrictions swallow our greatest ressource.</p>
<p>What do you think about?</p>
<p>I would be happy if you could share some insights about your country situation down below. And maybe if you're also involved in some activism, like speaking to people, sticker bombing, going to demos, etc! Let's connect.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and I'm always open for discussions in my dms aswell if you don't want to share on public!</p>

There's a worldwide app although more for a common law basis, it connects people and might be a great way to congregate us awakened around the globe. Also if we reach enough user numbers, we gain legal assistance by the creators. Find the app 'earth united' and spread the word if we want it to be of any use.</p>

<p>So very true. As a native english speaker, I just want to say that you did very well. Heck, there are some native speakers that can't write that well. </p>
<p>I think the main problem the covid-resistance has is similar to the problems of the Libertarian Party here in the us; we are not unified in a single belief, but in a category of beliefs. Some on NNN think the virus doesn't exist at all. Some think it was just overblown. Some think the vaccines are just untested. Some think they carry tracking microchips. </p>
<p>We are all over the place and un-unified in our reasoning. This makes it easy for people to lump in all sorts of crazy. But what we ARE unified in is our desired outcome; getting back to normal without forcing things onto anyone and for more people to look at these sort of events with a sceptical and analytical mind. </p>
<p>Not sure if any of that helps. Best of luck.</p>

<p>This helps a lot to see that there are a lot of woke people out there who've been thinking the same :) Where are you from? Are you actively involved in your country's movement?</p>

        <p>I appreciate the offer, but I am too busy (three kids, wife, home, ownership of a business, etc). I also have a local project that I am spearheading that should build community and practical skills and knowledge amongst the kids in town. You focus on the now, I will work on the next generation. </p>

        <p>I believe the “Antifa” organizations are government agent provocateurs.  TPTB have basically created a militia to terrorize communities without impunity under the guise of “social justice”.  They need to be called out for they are... </p>
<p>Have you heard of Catherine Austin Fitts? She claims these targeted communities are really just land grabs for bankers- destroy them and sell for cheap.</p>

        <p>I thought that it was insane that in Germany antifa (deliberate small letter) is siding WITH government! And against people fighting for basic freedoms and human rights, body integrity and what not, guaranteed by  EU constitutions. I am sure Iran government has a"very good reason" to mandate "face masks" for ladies there too.</p>

        <p>No I haven't! I'm going to check her out later.  Thanks</p>
<p>You are right. I believe it too. I watcheda lifestream of a protest a few weeks ago. It was about the protestors and a mob of antifa people (mainly young people). some people of the protest movement managed to get to talk to one (maybe very naive kid) from the antifa block from a distance while he was holding the antifa flag amongst his peers.One protestor yelled at some point to the kid "YOU'RE BOUGHT BY THE GOVERNMENT"and that kid just said "no from foundations, that's something completely different!" and got cut off right after by another guy from his side.</p>
<p>This just shows how indoctrinated they are. They've prob been fed lies like "the nutheads claim we are fed by the government. this is not true. we receive *nicer term for money* from foundations. this is something completely different." and that kid just swallowed it without thinking about it cause it's a serious psyop! reaching out even to the teens.</p>

        <p>Here in the usa they can label us as racists by suggesting that we are “right-wing conspiracy theory militias” and “Trump supoorters “ (even tho we are. who isnt?). Your English was great. I don’t know any other language, but the only mistakes you made were when u said “think about”. You should have said “think about it”. And when u said “what do you think about?”  this is a fine complete sentence on its own, but I think u wanted to say “what do you think about this?” some German tourists asked me if I could “make a picture” of them once ha. cracked me up.</p>

        <p>oopsie! I got you, thx for your nice words too :) Yes or becoming a present :)))))) this is very cute to me!</p>
<p>&rt; Here in the usa they can label us as racists by suggesting that we are “right-wing conspiracy theory militias” and “Trump supoorters “ (even tho we are. who isnt?). </p>
<p>It's only name calling from reality lacking bullies. Nothing more. <br>
It's the same here. But, instead of a Trump supporter, you have the "AFD-voter" which not only rhymes, but is absurd aswell. AFD is the ultimate rascist nationalist environment eating party here in germany in case you didn't know (source: national news tv)</p>

        <p>This is all a brilliant idea, we need to reach people's emotions. But how?</p>
<p>We could make a video or some sort of site compiling the terrible person experiences people have been put through thanks to restrictions, maybe?</p>
<p>I want to do something, but we need ideas, we need to make them happen with organisation.</p>

        <p>One of the best tactics I've seen so far is having a dance flashmob.  It's an inherently joyful, communal activity that's hard for people to truly hate even if they're judging on the surface.  Look up the "Danser Encore" videos from France and see if you can do something similar!</p>

        <p>Yes, a friend of mine showed me a video of it recently :) <br>
 But i think it's time to get more involved also in international projects (films/marketing/ads/flashmobs/strikes) not only one event at a time!</p>

        <p>I'm Belgian, and I've been thinking roughly the same thoughts, espacially the international part.</p>
<p>I kind of gave up on Germany after hearing about the camps, but if you're serious enough, you should look into Luxembourg.</p>
<p>We both share a border there, so does France, and they don't require testing on entry by land or sea, only at the airport.</p>
<p>If you could meet eachother at the border, activist groups could essentialy combine forces that way, without submitting to border travel regulations.</p>
<p>My fellow countrymen could definetly use some international counter perspective right about now, that's for sure.</p>
