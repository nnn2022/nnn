    <strong>About Germany</strong>
    <p><p>Ok, first off, sorry if my English is bad sometimes, it isn't my first language. </p>
<p>I wanted to tell you about the wonderful country of Germany /s. It's not wonderful. Not at all. </p>
<p>While the US and other countries are slowly opening up (or were never closed in the first place like Sweden), Germany is stuck in prepetual lockdown. Our politicians are too damn incompetent to do anything useful. And the worst thing is: EVERYONE is so fucking brainwashed. I see it every day at my school. I heard the others say that everyone who is protesting against the continuos violations of basic rights should die. Since this day, I <em>despise</em> my classmates. The regular protest I always go to has been banned, nobody shows up. The media, the general public, everyone applauds this. <br>
If you thought the snitching in the US was bad, you have seen nothing yet. Doctors are loosing their jobs because people call the police when they see them without a mask for 3 seconds. Yesterday in school there was a guy sitting in front of me, he was wearing 4 masks. 4.  One year ago, I was almost expelled from my school <em>for meeting a friend</em>. There is one teacher who screams at us when we sit close together at a table. Everyone around me (except my family and afromentioned friend) is completely caught in this kontorted, twisted "health" ideology. Because that's what it is - an ideology. <br>
But those are all old news. What really broke the camels back and inspred me to post this is what I found out today. The government wants to go even harder against protesters and "take every measure necessary" because allegedly they are against democracy (shameless projection, as it is the government trampling our rights, not the protesters). Also, they are updating their bullshit "infection protection law". For anyone who doesn't know, this law has been around for a few months and essentially allowed the governemt to implement all those tyrannical restrictions. And now they are updating it, so they can override even more basic rights from the "Grundgesetz", the very set of laws that was made after WW2 to prevent Nazi-like human rights violations in the future. </p>
<p>I hate this country (or at least the government), with passion. I have only a half year left before I turn 18. And when I turn 18, I will leave for good. I don't want any part of this shit. There i absolutely no hope here. I know the government, I know the mentality of the people. They would do <em>anything</em> just for "solidarity". This isn't solidarity. This is tyranny. I'm not even pretending to care anymore. I don't give a shit if your grandma dies. She was 87 and would have died anyways. I, and many other young people have our entire lives left to live. And the goverment is destroying this. You can call me selfish, maybe I am, but I'd rather be selfish than a pretentious fake-moral cunt dictating others how to live. Because this is what those people are - having unimportant, boring lives and now they get the chance to boss others around and look moral and righteous while doing it. This is their motivation - pure narcicism. Why else would they post all their "public freakouts" in which they "own the Karens" on social media? They behave exactly like concentration camp employees, having a miserable existence, tasting the flavour of power one day, going completely overboard with it and having others cheer on their stupid behavior. And before some doomer comes at me and says "So YOu ArE COMpaRinG WeaRiNg A MAsK To GeNOcIde?!", let me explain it to you, because you are obviously lacking reading comprehension skills. No, that's not the point. Hitler didn't go from 0 to 100. It was a <em>process</em>. A process that I can see happening already again. Years we spend getting education, chanting "never again" and what do we do? We do it again. </p>
<p>Before you spam me with insults, dear doomers (who are definitely reading this as you are obsessed with spreading your sick ideology), at least take a moment and think about what I said. Maybe then you will realize that you find yourself on the <em>wrong</em> side of history.  </p>
<p>Btw I have post notifications turned off, so I won't respond to any of your comments. Sorry, but I'm in a bad place lately and the last thing I need is some assholes insulting me. Sorry about this to everyone who provides a useful, serious comment.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing this. I have people tell me Germany is the model for how to handle it all the time. I suspected it wasnâ€™t nearly as peachy as they painted it to be</p>

        <p>I was living in Berlin but I was home in Canada visiting family when Covid hit last year and I decided to stay here because I didnt know how things would develop with borders and everything.</p>
<p>I returned back to Berlin in August to collect my things and I was glad I could go to the big Querdenker demos. But I already was feeling that the "anti-" movement was getting so big that there would have to be a big crackdown sometime.</p>
<p>I think in Germany you have a lot of people who dont take what the government says as "The Truth".  From former DDR people to even the Reichsburgers in their own way .. you have a lot of people who are skeptical of the government to begin with.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately this gets wrapped up with "being a Nazi".  I have seen people on /berlin who say they want to go out and protest .. but they dont want to go to the Querdenker events because they imagine them to be full of right-wing people.</p>
