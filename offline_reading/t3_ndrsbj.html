        <p>There's some fluff here, but it's also pretty relevant to what's going on. Saw the magnet videos circulating and was able to confirm on my own vaxxed kin the truth of it.</p>
<p>And that's what it's really all about. Finding the truth through a forest of lies and being confident to speak about them. So, occasionally someone posts a hilarious meme about AOC needing to apply J &amp; J talcum powder to her face diaper. Maybe fringe and not funny, but it could open the door to a discussion about how breaking international law on the conventions of treating children SHOULD be a problem for the left.</p>

        <p>This is the first discussion I've had on here that was actually level headed and something I can get behind. I'm all about finding the truth and learning new things, it's why I can here to the first place - to challenge my current beliefs and challenge any echo chambers I've created for myself.  </p>
<p>So I'm a little out of the loop on some things you mentioned - magnet videos about vaccines and the breaking international law part you mentioned. If it's not too much trouble, can you provide links so that I can do some research from there?</p>
