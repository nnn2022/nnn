    <strong>I'm obliged by contract to get the jab</strong>
    <p><p>Thowaway account for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>I'm a US Marine who just got to his unit. Went through the check in process pretty smoothly no real problems and my COC seems to like me. 
I was pretty happy until I had to sit down with my Gunnery Sergeant. One of the first things he asked was "Are you vaccinated?" I politely respond with "No, Gunnery Sergeant." He looked confused and then asked "Do you plan to?" I said no. 
He then explained that it's going to be mandatory soon and that if I refuse to take it I'll be processed out of the Marine Corps. I didn't know how to respond, but he told me to explain to him on Monday why I don't want the jab.
Guys, I love my job. My COC is awesome and the people I work with are family. The Marine Corps is my home and I can't help but want to stay in no matter what. That being said, I feel just as strongly about getting the jab. I don't want it, I don't need it. I'm 19 and have had COVID twice. 
Are there any military guys here that relate or are in the same situation? I could use some guidance.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: i could be discharged out of the military for refusing getting the vax.</p>
<p>Edit: I appreciate the feedback and the support. Y'all are awesome, and also right. I know they can't make me yet, but I'm afraid it's coming. When it comes, I'll seperate from the Marines because it isn't worth it. I love the Marine Corps like I said, but you guys are also right about there being other fights to fight. Semper fi guys, have a goodnight</p></p>

        <p>That’s a damn lie. Ask on r/usmc and they will tell you the truth. It’s not able to be mandated. They said Pendleton and Lejuene have 80-90% refusal rates. Do not fall for this. It’s pressure. It’s also likely not legal. Ask on there ASAP.</p>

        <p>Fuck this guy. He's is manipulating you, guilt-tripping you and trying to intimidate. He doesnt need to know why you wont get the jab, its not mandatory and Im pretty sure they have no right to make it mandatory. Stand your ground no matter what. Don't talk too much, there is no winning conversing with psychopaths or plain assholes.</p>

        <p>it's completely optional because it's not fda 'approved'</p>
<p>if it were approved, then you would be 'under contract' to take it, like you are with all the other 'vaccines' you are required (ordered) to get.</p>

        <p>If I had a nickel for every E-7 who lied about some bullshit he had no ability to know about id be able to pay off every E-3’s 18% interest 2021 Dodge Challenger. He’s lying to you to get the vaccine numbers up for the unit because it makes them look better to the current administration. It’ll take some backbone but you need to tell your unit you have no interest in taking the vaccine while it is not mandatory. It is your right to refuse. The only situation they could force it on you is if the president waived informed consent and at which point you could opt out of your contract as a conscientious objector. It could happen but you don’t have to cross that bridge early just because Gunny jackass thinks he knows what he’s talking about. Tell him whatever you have to but he has no right to punish you for not getting the vaccine so long as it is not FDA approved.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear this, too. It SUCKS.</p>
<p>I left a job I was very experienced in and very good at in March of 2020, in protest of the required masks, but more importantly, in anticipation of exactly what is happening now: the push for vaccines and the requirements starting to happen. I was in a job where it's only a matter of time before vaccines are required. Now I make about 30% of my previous income. But I'm safe from the vaccine for now and I am grateful and it's worth it to me.</p>
<p>I wish you the very best in deciding what to do. I'm sorry they're being dicks.</p>

        <p>Have a good read through some of the information (medical and scientific ) you'll have to dig in and cram lots of learning in by tomorrow evening. The short answer is you're not a lab rat 🐀. This is an experimental study. It's against the Nuremberg code. Also, you can't serve and protect your country if you are sick or worse Dead from the vaccines. There's a much higher risk (especially at your age) of illness, complications, or death for the mRNA experiment than from a coronavirus (aka. the seasonal flu. If it comes down to your health/life or serving... Pick yourself. There will be other battles to fight. Live for another day/week/month. Stay focused on the future.</p>

        <p>Listen it’s really simple bro, you get this experimental mRNA gene therapy “vaccine” and you’ll be dead in a few years and be suffering the whole way.  This is all about depopulation.  Get this possibility out of your head because your not gonna be alive to see 25 if you plan on getting this shit.  If you have any questions or are skeptical about what I’m saying or whatever it is please just reply I’ll be happy to explain something.  This is life and death man please think</p>

        <p>During the run up to the gulf war back in 94 they jabbed us with all kinds of experimental vaccines including Anthrax. The VA now believes that some of those vaccines contributed to developing Gulf War Syndrome.  I was told the same thing, get the vaccines or face a bad conduct discharge. Wish I had taken the BCD. I’ll never take another experimental vaccine.</p>

        <p>Weigh the pros and cons, make a decision, and stand by it. That really does suck. But at this point, things just are what they are. The reason why this tyrannical shit will continue, that nobody talks about, is that everyone (I’m talking about skeptical people) will justify their reasons why they had to get the vaccine. That’s what they’re banking on and that’s exactly what’s going to happen. I won’t get it, no matter what, knowing that it won’t matter anyways. At the end of day, not trying to discount the huge sacrifice you might have to make, but if we don’t have courage in the face of major adversity, then we’re doomed. I suspect that we’re doomed anyways, but I have made my decision and will be sticking to it</p>

        <p>Since you are a young Marine, I strongly recommend you regularly check the MARADMINs posted on the <a href="https://marines.mil">marines.mil</a> page regularly. This can help you find actual answers to questions, and filter out the BS that the higher ups try to tell you. If you cite an order/reference, and you are correct, they can't say anything to you, although they could try to make your life difficult. </p>

        <p>I am not from the US but know for certain that the military cannot force anyone to get an EUA drug/vaxx. They are doing a psyop on you because you're still 19 and malleable. Never sacrifice your bodily autonomy and health for a government that wants to use you as a ferret. Tell him that you will not be getting vaxxed and that it's only EUA-approved.</p>
