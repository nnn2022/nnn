    <strong>Do you believe they will try and force the vaccine on Americans?</strong>
    <p><p>I could probably get medical clearance, but I am scared. Other countries are already pushing things like vaccine passports.  What do you see happening? The majority of people in my area are lining up. Outside of online friends no one I know is refusing or questioning or at least saying they are. I've had several people I know on Zooms through organizations tell me they have gotten the jab including some older people who spoke of bad side effects but then said they "were glad they got it". I've seen a majority of proud newly vaccinated friends on Facebook. I kept my mouth shut. </p>
<p>I am wondering if I am going to become a pariah to society for refusing it .[in my case there are good and extreme complex medical reasons] and not be allowed to go anywhere.] My husband doesn't think they will force it on us. I feel like the net is closing in. I feel like I live in hell now, I believe the virus is real but they have manipulated things with it.</p></p>

        <p>I severely doubt it. There was a website someone linked here that showed pending or passed bills in each state related to vaccines, and each one was preventing employers from firing employees based on their vaccination status and things related to that. Even in the more lockdown heavy states there was nothing about forcing or excluding anybody to take it, just protecting our right to choose. I wish I could find it again but it really made me feel better about my own personal decisions. I’ve never been more happy to live here and you should too, despite our many other growing problems.</p>

        <p>I hope you are right. I think the private pressures will be there. Some people should file lawsuits against employers that demand it. I think it should remain a choice too. I consider leaving the country but hit a stalemate based on lack of resources and more. My husband did not want to leave and well he has great influence on my decisions. [he could claim citizenship in a European country but is a USA citizen via birthright] We probably won't be leaving. I even considering going to a more free part of USA may be better but I do live in a more rural "conservative" county. I am in strange position as a progressive now knowing those on the right stand against forced vaccines and will be more of allies on this issue. If you can find that link please post here. I am disabled so have no employer making demands, and do not have monies to internationally travel. So those are moot points. Husband works from home. I hope we are left in peace. My doctor given my severe history told me he understands whatever choice I make. We discussed vaccines but they are not offered yet to me.</p>

        <p>Dang I can’t find it but I think we’ll be fine domestically, but I’m not sure about international travel, it depends on how many countries implement this vaccine passport garbage and if it is actually effective. It’s entirely up to you what you think is best for yourself and others.</p>

        <p>Let’s first define who are “they”. Government? In the US it is extremely hard if not impossible. Thankfully, we have Constitution that doesn’t permit this. 
Employers can absolutely make it as condition of employment. Airlines can make it as condition of getting onboard. So private companies definitely can</p>

        <p>Private companies technically can set any standards they want. There are some exceptions that have to do with race, ethnicity, gender, religion and such but other than that they can do whatever they want. For instance, if company mandates that tomorrow all employees must wear clown make up they absolutely can do it.</p>

        <p>I’m not an anti vaxxer by any means but I am an anti mRNA vaxxer. Making entire populations take an experimental vaccine that hasn’t been around for a year is literally how I would start the script for a scary movie. </p>
<p>I hope it never comes to this but if vaccine passports become a reality, I would probably take the Johnson and Johnson vaccine, which is based on “traditional” vaccine science.</p>

        <p>I keep seeing this same sentiment. Do you know that Johnson and Johnson has paid out billions in class action lawsuits for causing people cancer with baby powder? Millions for pelvic mesh suits? Supplied a key ingredient in the opioid epidemic? Sells risperdal to “treat autism” yet it causes gynecomastia? The list goes on and on and on. It’s unexplainable how they are allowed to remain in business, and how despite people having this knowledge, would choose to trust them to inject foreign substances into their bodies.!</p>

        <p>America? Not right now. Considering how hard it's been to get mask compliance in some states, I don't think they would win this battle anywhere other than hard blue states. </p>
<p>Other countries? Now that's a real possibility. </p>
<p>And mind you it won't be forced. Nobody will hold you down and jab you. They will simply defer responsibility to the businesses to enforce this, and make it mandatory to screen people, or something like that. And likely it will start with international travel first, then expand inwards. </p>

        <p>It seems to me a lot of people on the right would be against it. They would have too much of a fight on their hands and you are right about the mask compliance. I was unhappy with antimaskers, but they will be allies on no forced vaccines. Life has gotten so strange.  I do think businesses could ban people. I hope we don't get in a situation where unvaccinated people won't be allowed to shop but surely some store owners are right wingers. I am very much against passports. As a progressive I have told people the left can go fascist too, and well many are busy going that way.</p>

        <p>I am screwed from either side, the right wing, hates poor people and wants to destroy all safety nets, supports theocracy in some circles and things are not too friendly for the disabled like me. The left wing is friendlier to the disabled and does value things I do, on the progressive side, but the cancel culture, trust in the system stuff isn't going down well. Any political belief can go fascist.</p>

        <p>the right wing most definitely does not hate poor people - that statement is an example of unthinking bigotry. most people on the right simply want to reduce inflated government and state waste. </p>
<p>and you don’t think disabled conservatives exist?</p>

        <p>The GOP goes after Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid every chance they get and cut all the programs including elderly and senior care.They never care about the trillions spent on useless wars but dive bomb for the disabled FIRST. Sure there's disabled conservative people.</p>

        <p>I work for Amazon and they had a survey as to who would like to get vaccinated and why/ why not. I put in that I would not, because i have doubts that it's safe. They aren't requiring the vaccine but they have offered a small bonus and some hours off work for some warehouse locations' employees.  I think that's going to be more of the case nationwide: privileges for vaccinated people until we reach herd immunity.</p>

        <p>Well it would be hard because they haven't even allowed the vaccine to people under 65 yet, and a large portion of front line workers have refused it, which in it's self should say something.</p>
