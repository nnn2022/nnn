    <strong>Are you guys seeing more traffic, now that you're right?</strong>
    <p><p>"Your right to swing your fist ends at my nose: for now, that extends to respiratory droplets." This simple concept guided BOTH my actions and rhetoric throughout the pandmic, but the game has changed and no one seems to have noticed. </p>
<p>In Denver, folks have instantly masked back up. This is madness. No one poses a threat to anyone who protects themselves, except the magical "immunocompromised" who are saying, without fail in my experience, "Hey, don't make society live like I have to, this sucks, I wouldn't wish this on anyone, I just want to not die getting groceries." </p>
<p>Is this subreddit getting more traffic? Are folks like me, who were strongly pro-mask and pro-lockdown at the time, coming out of the woodwork and saying, "Hey, if folks want to die, let them. No masks, no restrictions" or is everyone just taking it? </p>
<p>The "liberal media" won't acknowledge a rift in the Democratic party: "Hey, if we're counting on a bunch of ignorant hicks to get jabbed or sick, this is gonna take......3-5 years."</p></p>

        <p>We are being totally gaslit.   Look at lolapalooza 2021.    Beatle juice let 100,000 unmasked unvaccinated people to create a 4 day mosh pit because they are liberal artists playing and making Money.   But let a church open for a couple of hundred or you go to the store or restaurant omg the world will end.</p>

<p>Sorry to come in with guns blazing, but  Internet rhetoric is what it is. There was some bad info out of this sub back in the darkest days, but again...outside was always safe, surfaces have always been safe, transient encounters have always been safe. </p>
<p>My understanding of the spread of this damned bug comes from a call center in Hong Kong from March '20. Half of one floor got sick. No one else on that floor, no one else on any floor. Elevators: safe. Even if it was the dreaded Delta, the actual mechanisms haven't changed: stale inside air. </p>
<p>This sub always acknowledged that, that's for sure.</p>

<p>Yep, what you're saying makes total sense.</p>
<p>Outside has been safe from day 1. Even as a zealot I happily bet Dad's life on sitting outside and eating BBQ in the light breeze as being literally as safe as it gets.</p>

        <p>The flow only goes one way. No one is becoming pro-mask or restrictions.</p>
<p>The problem was people getting political in the first place. All this division created to pit people against each other as a distraction, while they further their collective agendas.</p>
<p>I've shifted to being anarchist/libertarian in the past 2 years. Of course they don't want <em>anyone</em> thinking outside of the two parties they have put in place. Why would anyone want to associate, vote or even look to these kinds of people for any kind of advice? They are not experts in anything other than propaganda, and they certainly do not have anyone's best interests at heart but their own.</p>
<p>That's why they never have debates.</p>
<p>That's why their "experts" are largely nameless, faceless, or proven to be paid-for shills.</p>
<p>What's why they silence anyone who speaks out against them.</p>
<p>That's why they are taking away peoples freedom to criticize governments and to protest.</p>
<p>This place is a gathering of people who refuse to succumb to dystopian narratives and such blatant incoherence and irrationality that you would otherwise end up completely demoralized, weak willed and bereft of any kind of spine.</p>

<p>You must mean here. Folks are absolutely becoming pro-masks &amp; pro-restriction, or at least the herd is blinking that way. </p>

<p>This right here. </p>
<p>I just now almost private messaged via Facebook a favorite place, the Mercury Cafe in Denver. They do mostly hippy shit, but also old school swing dancing, which is gendered AF. Anyway, I wanted to say, "Hey, you guys really should be <em>reluctantly</em> following the public health orders, not LEADING them." </p>
<p>I'll just let that one marinate.</p>

        <p>What I think the guy you are responding to means is that although people are masking back up, it’s either because:</p>
<p>A) they never stopped being pro-mask and pro-restrictions. They just briefly took off the masks because they believed it was safe to do so, but now they don’t believe it is safe anymore. </p>
<p>B) feel social pressure. They may personally agree with us, but feel pressured (or are mandated to). </p>
<p>There is almost no one who was “red pilled” to what is going on who now changed their mind and wants to wear masks and social distance again now. The people who saw the gaslighting and sense that something weird is going on are not going to  change their minds and want the restrictions again.</p>

<p>The real question, though, is how many of us got "red pilled" by the reversal on masking? </p>
<p>The May CDC guidance wasn't supposed to happen. Remember how messy it was? Think about it. The gears of the system are still grinding in response. They were never supposed to let down. It was almost Bidens shining legacy, and now it is his disgrace. </p>
<p>What I'm asking, super specifically, is how many of us are like, "OK, this the last straw. Wear masks to protect others? Fine. Masks no longer protects others unless they are idiots? Fuck no."</p>
