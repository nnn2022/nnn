    <strong>Gender Ideology and CRT are part of this new normal push we should be worried about.</strong>
    <p><p>If you haven’t noticed during this pandemic they have been pushing critical race theory and gender ideology at a much faster pace it seems. Part of this I think is because youth are at home a lot now and are spending a lot more time on the internet, and at this point the left owns most mainstream news corporations and all social media platforms. I believe it is directly related. I also noticed there isn’t a sub addressing any of these issues, probably because they got removed for “transphobia” when you’re really just acknowledging the biological reality of 2 genders. Anyways; I made a sub if you guys want to check it out r/GenderIsBinary</p></p>

        <p>All of these postmodern ideologies are a vehicle for selling authoritarian thinking to disaffected young people.</p>
<p>I despair of the youth culture of today, placid and blindly obedient. The youth cultures of previous generations turned their discontent outward and fought for social change. The youth cultures of today turn their discontent inward, take antidepressants, swallow the ideology they are spoonfed and think "[cartoon character] says trans rights" counts as dangerously subversive and edgy.</p>
<p>I'm sure some people out there would respond with "OK boomer", to which my response is - I'm 28. Turns out the boomers had a point.</p>

        <p>Here in England, I noticed how a few seemingly unconnected political views became strongly associated with attitudes either for or against lockdowns and coerced vaccines - the media gives the impression that there is one group who are left wing supporters of lockdowns and BLM and gender identity, while another group are right wing and against all those things.</p>
<p>There is probably a grain of truth in that, with so many examples from each group - but perhaps there are also people who are not getting much attention who overlap those unconnected set of views.</p>

        <p>I think the next trend will be women removing their boobs because any risk of breast cancer is too much risk and it is offensive, like that is why they call breastfeeding chestfeeding now we gotta be more inclusive. Then people will start removing their genitals because it’s too offensive that we’re different down there as well, like what if a man wanted to get a Pap smear?</p>

        <p>&rt;"The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people," former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman told Harper's writer Dan Baum for the April cover story published Tuesday.</p>
<p>&rt;"You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities," Ehrlichman said. "We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."</p>

        <p>This is actually a very good point.</p>
<p>The way I see it, the extreme vaccine worshippers, the genderfluidnonconformingpansexualethnicallyunsureunbinary lot, then BLM/CRT mob and all the other postmodern idealogs are all travelling in the same, rather worrying direction.</p>
<p>The move to forced group identities is IMO fast becoming the undoing of society. Shifting the focus back to individuality rather than group identity, I believe would redress the societal imbalance we are currently seeing.</p>
<p>For a more specific point, I am of the belief (which I believe is backed by scientific principles) that gender and sex are one and the same. You are either a male, female, or in rare cases (some one-in-five thousand) intersex. </p>
<p>Anything else to me is just sexual preference. I believe in freedom of choice and freedom of expression completely. If you are born with a tallywhacker and want to dress as a woman, then go ahead my friend - it does not make you a woman - but I would not think any less of you, that is until you force me to participate in your game of make believe and adjust my language and actions to suit your delusion.</p>
