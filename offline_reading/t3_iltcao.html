    <strong>Vaccine logistics and the cold chain</strong>
    <p><p>It has recently come to light that some of the vaccines currently under development are going to need a cold logistics chain that doesn't currently exist. T<a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/08/31/cold-chain-and-colder-chain-distribution">his article, by Derek Lowe</a> discusses some of the problems. Apparently, according to Lowe, the  </p>
<p><em>"...Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech candidates, both of which are promising and are well into Phase II/III trials, .. [do not only need] refrigeration. Moderna’s vaccine needs to be shipped and stored at -20 C (minus four Fahrenheit), while the Pfizer/BioNTech one needs to be at -70 C (-94 F). The former is enough of a challenge – freezer temperatures instead of refrigerator ones. But the latter. . .well, biology research labs all have freezers that go down that far (it’s where cell culture samples, oligonucleotide constructs, and recombinant proteins get stored), but you’re not going to find one down at the local pharmacy, which is perhaps where you were picturing lining up for a coronavirus shot."</em></p>
<p>So in order for these vaccines to work, leaving aside the issues around safety, we are going to have to create a new logistics chain with very cold facilities and create arrangements for distribution that follow the kind of careful attention to temperatures usually only found in laboratories. Good luck managing that in your local town, let alone third world countries.</p></p>

        <p>Why you think this is a problem? Authorities care if you have a vaccine certificate, that's about it. That's what they ask in a school, college or in a medical center for employment or when you travel. They don't care whether the vaccine worked or not. That's why they never test anything, before or after vaccination. If they did care, they would measure immunity and would only talk about immunity. How you got immunity would be irrelevant.</p>
