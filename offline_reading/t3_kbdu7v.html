        <p>I legitimately don’t understand your viewpoint. Sweden has reached 99% hospital capacity and it is well proven that masks reduce the transmission rate by a decent amount. Probably an unpopular viewpoint in this subreddit but it can’t hurt to wear a mask when hospitals are at max capacity and community spread is rampant, right?</p>

        <p>you'd have to know the average capacity of the hospitals at this time in non covid years to make any real comparisons. </p>
<p>We've proven on this sub time and time again that at least in the U.S, icus operate at almost or above max capacity year after year because hospitals are not built with "pandemics" in mind.</p>
<p>While it is possible Sweden is seeing an increase in their capacity because of covid, it is also likely those units were running near capacity and the increase is not enough for logical government officials to demand masks.</p>

        <p>Alright then. I understand opposition towards rushed vaccines or mandatory vaccines, but I don’t see how wearing a mask impacts anyone if it might help in terms of public health. We’ve almost eradicated covid in Australia through a combination of border restrictions, social distancing measures, imposed quarantine periods, and mandatory masks.</p>

        <p>why do doomers do this? </p>
<p>Why do they ignore directly what has been said and just go back to preaching masks and lockdowns? </p>
<p>Do you not like logic and science anymore when it isn't going your way? </p>
<p>you asked, I answered. </p>
<p>you didn't like the answer, you deflect. </p>
<p>And you'll have covid again when you open your borders. Unless of course you get your little health passports or they keep you locked down for another year. </p>
<p>They couldn't eliminate the common cold in Antartica with 17 weeks of complete self isolation... </p>
<p>That is <em>complete</em> self isolation. </p>
<p>I'm sorry love but... covid 19 is never going away. I know it hurts and doomer logic tells you if you just let the government lock you up in nice quarantine hotels you'll <em>stop the spread</em>. </p>
<p>You won't.</p>

        <p>You seem quite aggressive about this. I’m certainly not a “doomer” and I’m not ignoring science. Empirically it seems that within my country, restrictions and masks made a huge difference. I went to a large concert last weekend with no masks or any consideration of covid at all other than hand sanitiser being available at the bar. It seems that was only possible because of a quick response with measures that were put in place. I didn’t have any harsh lockdowns in my state. For 2 months I worked from home and didn’t go to bars or restaurants, that’s all. Yeah I’m against opening international borders, I’m enjoying life basically as it has always been and I don’t want covid to be a factor again.</p>

        <p>There have been restrictions and mask mandates for over 9 months in the US, and the overwhelming majority of people seem to be happy to follow whatever they're told to do. For the safety of others  And yet, here we are, 9 months later, still talking about spikes, ICUs at capacity and blah, blah, blah......Mass hysteria and fear mongering still being spewed from virtually every single media outlet 24/7. So if these measures really do have a positive effect (you remember, "flatten the curve" ) then why the fuck are we still having this conversation? If you think for a minute that it made a difference, then I have some swampland in COVID riddled Florida to sell you. </p>
<p>It's no different than eradicating influenza. It still exists. Always will. Even with vaccines. And no one ever felt compelled to inflict draconian mandates that crushed economies and ruined lively hoods for that. Fact is, no amount of lock downs or mask mandates will eradicate COVID-1984 either. </p>
<p>And I love all of the "I work from home and don't go out" virtue signals people keep throwing out there. Wow! Such martyrs. Sacrificing for the common good. How glorious of you. Did you ever stop to consider that, for the overwhelming majority of the world population, working from home is not even an option. But hey, glad you're able to do your part. Meanwhile, life has to go on.......</p>

        <p>In a lab maybe they're shown to reduce it but on a societal level despite overwhelming adoption of them we haven't seen a reduction. Go ahead and blame it on non-compliance because that's the immediate go-to but in my personal experience in the city vast majority of people are wearing masks when near others (even in places like Walmart) yet in my county numbers are still going up at a similar pace.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University is now tracking mask compliance in their dashboard. Data is based off of Facebook surveys which admittedly will have a bit of a bias towards compliance but I still think take off even 5% off the compliance and that's a reasonably accurate figure.</p>
<p>If you look at tons of places that are seeing increases in covid such as Los Angeles county you also see that the compliance is reported at a steady 93-5%. Experts were saying that we would just need 80% in order to curb this thing. And experts aside if they work and even 90% he's wearing them we should at least see daily cases remain flat especially when combined with all of the other extreme measures we've been taking. If they work then why isn't Los Angeles seeing it curbed and is instead seeing increases?</p>

        <p>I don’t have the answer for that but I wish everyone the best in remaining healthy. I guess we are very privileged in Australia to have mostly eradicated covid. I feel that it can’t hurt to wear a mask if it reduces transmission but maybe it’s too far gone in the USA to be worthwhile.</p>

        <p>I mean of course. I don't wish anyone ill but that also means that we be concerned about other illnesses besides coronavirus. Mental health has been devastated by this. Lots of people are foregoing routine screenings that could catch cancer or other conditions early and lead to much better outcomes. Heck just the stress and anxiety alone is probably taking extra months off of people's lives.</p>
<p>I both envy Australia and don't period good for y'all at you are able to be rid of it for now but it's pretty clear you allare in this hyperparanoid state. As soon as you had one case a whole city / region got hyperlocked down. That's no way to live.</p>

        <p>I understand your stance but it was actually once there were upwards of 700+ cases per day that harsh lockdowns were introduced. Within 2 months we were down to 0 cases per day across most/all states. There have been a few cases since then, but it’s at a very manageable level now. In reality here people are not paranoid at all, if anything we are complacent because we have been very lucky so far. Most people have been living as per usual for most of the year, other than a few restrictions.</p>

        <p>FYI, not all types of published evidence are equal: meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials sit at the top of the <a href="https://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/rbof/v78n6//0034-7280-rbof-78-06-0413-gf01.jpg">biomedical evidence hierarchy</a>, and should be given more weight than laboratory/mechanistic and surveys/observational/correlational studies. Here's my keeping track of the last three months, to avoid arguments of the type that "there's new research since then...": </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On <strong>20 November</strong> 2020, <em>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</em> published <em>Physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses</em>, <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006207.pub5/epdf/abstract">(Jefferson et al., 2020)</a>. The review noted: 
&rt;Medical or surgical masks: Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes <strong>no difference</strong> in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort. N95/P2 respirators: Four studies were in healthcare workers, and one small study was in the community. Compared with wearing medical or surgical masks, wearing N95/P2 respirators probably makes <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people have confirmed flu (5 studies; 8407 people); and may make <strong>little to no difference</strong> in how many people catch a flu-like illness (5 studies; 8407 people) or respiratory illness (3 studies; 7799 people). Unwanted effects were not well reported; discomfort was mentioned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>18 November</strong> 2020, <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> published <em>Effectiveness of Adding a Mask Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Danish Mask Wearers. 
A Randomized Controlled Trial</em>, <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">(Bundgaard et al., 2020)</a>. This is the first and only RCT we have on mask effectiveness against COVID-19 in community settings, but its findings of ineffectiveness are fully expected in light of all the other RCTs we have on other respiratory viruses. The results of the study: 
&rt;A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. <strong>Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>17 November</strong> 2020, <em>International Journal of Infectious Diseases</em> published <em>Meta-analysis on facemask use in community settings to prevent respiratory infection transmission shows no effect</em>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220324504">(Gómez-Ochoa &amp; Muka, 2020)</a>. The authors noted: 
&rt;there were no significant differences between medical facemasks use only and controls in the odds of developing laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness. Similarly, no differences in laboratory-confirmed influenza risk were observed when comparing mask use solely versus combined intervention of face mask and handwashing, indicating that facemask as solely intervention in community is not associated with reducing respiratory infection. Given the studies used medical masks, cloth masks' efficacy is expected to be even lower; a randomized cluster trial showed that respiratory infection is higher among health care personnel using cloth masks than using medical masks (MacIntyre et al., 2015)...Due to these divergent results and the lack of high-quality research in this area, strong recommendations for facemask use in the community context should be issued with caution until new evidence is available to show their effectiveness. This is even more important, considering that several studies showed that mask use is associated with headache incidence and worsening of pre-existing headache (Lim et al., 2006, Rebmann et al., 2013, Szeinuk et al., 2000, Radonovich, 2009, Shenal et al., 2011).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>27 October</strong> 2020, <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em> published "Update Alert 3: Masks for Prevention of Respiratory Virus Infections, Including SARS-CoV-2, in Health Care and Community Settings" (<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/L20-1292">Chou et al., 2020</a>), to summarize very recent research on masks up until 2 October 2020. The authors noted the serious methodological limitations of the more recent studies and concluded: 
&rt;The strength of evidence for mask use and risk for SARS-CoV-2 in <em>community settings</em> remained insufficient...Evidence for mask use versus nonuse and comparing masks types in <em>health care settings</em> remained insufficient...There were no new studies on the effectiveness and safety of mask reuse or extended use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>25 September</strong> 2020, the academic journal <em>Frontiers in Medicine</em> published <em>Effectiveness of Surgical Face Masks in Reducing Acute Respiratory Infections in Non-Healthcare Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</em>, by <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2020.564280/full">(Wang et al., 2020)</a>. The review failed to find a statistically significant effect and concluded: 
&rt;Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is <strong>not significantly associated</strong> with reduction in ARI [acute respiratory infections] incidence in this meta-review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On <strong>22 September</strong> 2020, the academic journal <em>Environmental Research</em> published <em>The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain: Hygiene habits, sociodemographic profile, mobility patterns and comorbidities</em>, by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120311208?via=ihub">(Rodríguez-Barranco et al., 2021)</a>. The authors noted: 
&rt;<strong>In the case of masks, the results of this study slightly suggest the opposite effect to that of protection</strong>, possibly due to misuse of masks by the general population untrained in their use.</p>

        <p>Booo they decided to shutdown schools. </p>
<p>&rt; In a bid to stem a severe second wave, Prime minister Stefan Lofven announced on Thursday that high schools would switch to distance learning for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Too bad they had to cave a bit to pressure. Wish they would have taking a stronger stance against imposing any restrictions, still It is a very minor concession and overall they have been the global Paragon.</p>

        <p>What do you call people that homeschool then. </p>
<p>The problem isn't the method of learning the problem is teachers that have no idea what they're doing with this type of learning.  </p>
<p>Go look up PAVCS is been around since 01 and the students have everything they need to succeed. Including field trips, community days, an asynchronous option for them to work at their own pace, the option for extra classes even at very young ages if they want.</p>
<p>Its so infuriating to me when people rag on cyber education when cyber isn't the problem its teachers that don't understand cyber. And parents that don't want to put in any work.</p>

        <p>They’ve always been dead. Every time I see an article about Sweden I just scream “Oh my science!” at the top of my lungs. I feel bad for using the word science in vain but honestly, there’s no way Sweden is even still inhabited.</p>

<p>I wouldn't call Sweden a bastion of sanity. Their stance on multiculturalism &amp; gender norms is questionable to say the least.</p>
<p>Their sane Covid-19 approach is probably just a matter of one right person at the right place being able to block the surreal totalitarianism pushed in most other European countries.</p>
<p>The one thing this whole "pandemic" has demonstrated, is how much power a single person can have in determining the lives of millions of people!</p>

        <p>&rt;It’s crazy how they KNOW and DO self isolate compared to most of the American population</p>
<p>As in Sweden, most people in Belgium self-isolate. They also put on masks and abide by any of the other totalitarian measures forced onto them.</p>
<p>Yet the country still was forced into a second lockdown and still has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-mortality-p-scores?tab=chart&amp;stackMode=absolute&amp;country=BEL~SWE~NLD~GBR~DEU~FRA&amp;region=World">among the worst mortality figures in Europe</a>, both during the "first wave" AND during the "second wave".</p>
<p>If stricter measures means fewer deaths, how do you explain Belgium?</p>

        <p>They have pretty radical measures here in sweden to stop the spread of covid. I'm in university for example and we haven't been able to see our classmates at all for a long time. We can't go to bars and so on. That's why we're able to stop the spread without a mask mandate. Lockdowns work.</p>

        <p>I mean't that lockdowns are effective in reducing the spread of coronavirus, more so than masks. I'm not saying that lockdowns don't have negative consequences. If we are a couple of months away from a vaccine however the negative consequences of a lockdown will be outweighed by the positive consequences since you don't have to do the lockdown very long. If a vaccine weren't coming at all lockdowns would be bad.</p>

<p>You're naive if you think that vaccines will stop these lockdowns or mask wearing... or that vaccines won't for far more damage than the virus.</p>
<p>Also, even a lockdown of a few weeks causes irreperable damage that doesn't justify the hypothetical loss of life prevented by it. In fact, there's probably more deaths directly caused by the lockdowns than saved by the lockdowns!</p>

        <p>I'm not saying lockdowns work for me, can you imagine moving to a new town and starting university and being totally isolated because of covid? That's really bad for my mental health problems. I'm willing to make that sacrifice because a vaccine is coming in a couple of months so the lockdown will end when a sufficient amount of risk factor people are vaccinated. You and small bussinesses should make the same sacrifice!</p>

        <p>I did not say it was not Covid. Do not put words in my mouth please. That's a bit of a problem as well. You read what you want to read, you should only look at what was written/said. Don't put your own bias into it.</p>
<p>The new rise in hospital cases could very well be covid. I'm not from Sweden and I'm working now so I'm not going to look for the numbers either.
But let's say for arguments sake they are all covid patients. Does that proof to you that they were infected by not wearing a mask? Here in the Netherlands we are mandated to wear a mask. But the cases are still rising here. Thus the masks are not the problem.
We even saw a rise in covid deaths when we went into lockdown, so that doesn't seem to be working either.</p>
<p>I'm not going to tell you what I think the problem is. Because I don't want you to believe everything someone says. Not me, not someone on this forum, not the media. What do you think? Why are cases rising again?</p>

        <p>Again, not what I said. 
Bit since you're asking me: I don't think we can stop the spread of a virus for 100%.
The virus is here and it can be hurtful for people with health problems and the elderly. We should do everything to protect those people and find the best ways possible.
Shutting down a country, mandating face masks for the entire population and in the process ruining the economy is not the best course of action.</p>
