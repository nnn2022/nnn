        <p>This one trillion dollar infrastructure bill that has nothing to do with infrastructure is very worrying. The fact that it is a trillion dollars of money that needs to be printed is worrying. This cuts the spending power of the average American down as this causes inflation and now we are looking at something that resembles hyperinflation.</p>
<p>This bill is something like 2700 pages and in it there are ludicrous things that make driving so much more difficult and costly such as a per mile driving tax on top of any other taxes already associated with driving. This bill mandates vehicle manufacturers to have eye scanning technology as well as breathalyzer technology and monitoring technology in all new cars.</p>
<p>This bill in shrines gender identity into law. This means that men can now go to female prisons and play in women's sports and it's protected by law. Science denial also becomes a crime so the CDC becomes and infallible organization that you cannot criticize under penalty of the law. </p>
<p>That last point is particularly alarming because as we have seen the CDC has fudged the science and made claims that are unscientific and have called them science. Masks don't do a goddamn thing and yet we are listening to the "science"  that says they do.</p>
<p>I don't know if you guys have noticed but this infrastructure bill just like the last couple Biden has put forth has nothing to do with infrastructure. There are no bridge repairs or road pairs nothing for train stations or lighthouses. An infrastructure bill needs simply 50 + 1 majority. This is a dirty trick to pass as much bullshit as possible.</p>
