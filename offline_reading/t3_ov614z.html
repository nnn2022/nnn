    <strong>BlackRock presented their 'Going direct reset' plan to the central bankers at Jackson Hole in August 2019, they said their plan would need to be able to define "the unusual circumstances that would call for such unusual coordination"</strong>
    <p><p>‘The Going direct reset’ was presented at the central bankers’ meeting in Jackson Hole on August 22nd 2019. The plan was devised by the Blackrock investment group and presented in a document called ‘Proposal for dealing with the next downturn’. Basically this is a global financial coup of private bankers to take over the world economy by a radical reengineering of the US monetary system.</p>
<p>The PDF of their plan is still online, download it before it gets memory-holed</p>
<p>BlackRock - “A practical way of “going direct would need to deliver the following: 1) defining the unusual circumstances that would call for such unusual coordination”</p>

        <p>That's interesting because Blackrock is also the hedge fund that is buying up real estate to price home buyers out of the market. Today the moratorium on evictions and foreclosure ends leaving 6 million renters potentially on the street and 2 million homes closed on.</p>
<p>I wonder if their desire for the great reset and to buy all the property had anything to do with all the politicians wanting to go on holiday at the most perfect time.</p>

        <p>Blackrock is basically the ruler of this world.
They have major shares in mostly every company, and so they have representitives in every shareholders meetings.
They can influence governments or is the government that bows at them</p>
