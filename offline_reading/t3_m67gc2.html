        <p>I hate to say it, but it is a partisan issue. I’m not going to argue that conservatives are inherently smarter or less likely to engage in groupthink, but I definitely think it’s a consequence of conservatives noticing frightening trends of propaganda in the monolith of progressive media and institutions. </p>
<p>So really, it’s just circumstances that are making conservative leaning people suspicious of government and media, but it’s definitely a trend along political lines. Under different circumstances and in past decades, conservatives were certainly the ones to be susceptible to more propaganda and uphold the status quo to the detriment of society.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your perspective. </p>
<p>I don’t really consider myself a liberal or a conservative (I wanted Trump to win over Biden but I don’t like politics, politicians or the government in general and agree with liberals about some things and conservatives about others.)</p>
<p>To me, this seems like a targeted effort to persuade liberal-identifying people into take the vaccine, because they don’t want to be like “those dumb Trump supporters”, which is for some reason - the result of years of conditioning I guess - their worst fear. That’s kind of the point I was trying to make.</p>
<p>The propaganda runs deep and it’s a tragedy how many people fall for it without even stopping to ask a single question.</p>

        <p>I think you’re correct and you’re making a good point, but I did want to respond to your title because I think it neglects to take into account the very real trends that are occurring. This article may have that goal, as you’re suggesting, but the divide between progressives (I’m intentionally not saying liberals) and conservatives in this instance is definitely a huge part of the reason conservatives are far more hesitant of the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I like the fact that you make a distinction between liberal and “progressive”. Most people don’t understand it which is why I don’t usually phrase it that way.</p>
<p>You’re probably not wrong, and the conservatives are definitely being smart in this instance.</p>
<p>What most people don’t understand is that you can be liberal (valuing freedom) and conservative (thinking things work how they are and not wanting them to change) at the same time, “progressive” doesn’t mean what people think it does (progress towards what? Has anyone bothered to ask?) and how all of this language has been distorted and weaponized to divide us and turn us against each other.</p>
<p>You get it. I like you.</p>

        <p>Yeah, there comes a point when even people of leftist persuasion who would have been progressives at some point must stand back and wonder where “progress” should stop (and also  a point when conservatives must be able to recognize what should not be conserved). </p>
<p>Well said. Likewise.</p>

        <p>I just wanted to piggyback, here.</p>
<p>The Official System Ideology is called, "Leftism," but if you look closely, it has nothing to do with improving the lives of workers and the lower-class.</p>
<p>People who follow this synthetic ideology aren't "Leftists," in the sense that they rationally considered and consciously chose their beliefs. They're just accepting the system propaganda.</p>
<p>For that reason, I propose we call them "system drones."</p>

        <p>When Trump was in office, Harris said she was not going to take his vaccine. Then she got in office, and now it's suddenly safe. Fauci wants Trump to tell his supporters to take the vaccine. He can claim the vaccine's great all he wants (and has been). People who believe in liberty and freedom of choice aren't so easy to sway just because they hear something on TV. What NY Times doesn't realize is that vilifying their "opposition" is only going to make people more resistant.</p>

        <p>And they can still vaguely tie it to Trump, just like this article is doing.</p>
<p>Seriously, I recommend reading it if you haven’t. I know it’s propaganda, but they’re making their agenda more and more transparent.</p>
<p>I don’t even care about Trump himself one way or the other, I just saw him as the lesser of two evils. It’s the cultural implications of it that I’m worried about.</p>

        <p>It says only 10%  of democrats, and maybe I'm just speaking for myself, but I think it's higher because many democrats recognize that speaking out against certain topics is a bad idea. The groupthink of the left is dangerous. I'm a democrat not getting the vaccine but I haven't told anyone in my life and don't plan to unless directly asked.</p>

        <p>I mean, has anyone see that video of that women who grew up in Austria during WWII speaking in California?</p>
<p>The people who were against giving up their weapons were painted as threats to society and outcasted. Anyone who went against the mainstream narrative was ostracized and even when they showed up at your door and told you get on the train, people <em>still</em> didn’t believe that anything bad would happen to them. Like these people literally died probably unable to admit to themselves how they could let this happen. In fact, they tend to double down to prove that they were even wrong in the first place.</p>
<p>People really need to fucking study up on some history. These progressive policies are sliding into this territory and it’s scaring the shit out of me.</p>
<p>Long story short - they want this to be a partisan issue.</p>

        <p>Do you have a link? I am fascinated by this type of thing, we don’t read about the general “feel” of the times when we look in the history books. I want to know how people with dissenting (even if correct) opinions were treated by their peers, if mob mentality really is the true evil that allows this type of thing to happen, etc.</p>

        <p>Thanks dude. It’s the social pressure, not the government pressure, that’s the hardest to resist. When you become an outcast in your own community for adhering to your own values rather than swallow lies, it’s a special kind of hell.</p>

        <p>Lol true. Though I’m at the stage I can’t handle the trash anymore. I decided to watch a news conference of our premier (governor) talk about the vaccine rollout. And I couldn’t stop laughing and being angry at the theatre of it all. Seeing the sheep lead to slaughter. Had to turn it off in a few mins. </p>
<p>Hoping and working towards a life where I don’t ever have to hear about any of this shit ever. Have a farm grow my veggies and read.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good life. I would offer to join you, start a commune and help raise some goats or something but based on your use of the word “premier” I’m guessing you’re in Canada or Australia and that’s a hard pass 😅</p>

        <p>Plenty of Democrats flat out don’t want the vaccine. I think the numbers are like 30% to 20% between Democrats and Republicans who say they don’t want the vaccine. I definitely wouldn’t call that a partisan issue. </p>
<p>The idea of vaccine “passports” is gonna be quite a bit more partisan, I suspect. This part of the debate is gonna get real ugly.</p>
