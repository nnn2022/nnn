<p>Because <strong>3,988 Pfizer Vaccine Deaths¬†at under 1% reported, is not enough murder for a ‚Äúvirus‚Äù that has a greater than 99.9% survival rate:</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Pfizer is planning to seek approval for a third dose of its COVID-19 vaccine for distribution.</strong></p>
<p>The never-ending vaccines are here for a disease that is less lethal for those under 30-years-old than the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>&rt;<em>Pfizer is ready to seek U.S. authorization for a third dose of its coronavirus vaccine, outlining Thursday a top up shot within 12 months could dramatically boost immunity and counter any virus mutant.</em></p>
<p><em>Pfizer‚Äôs Dr. Mikael Dolsten told the Associated Press early data from the company‚Äôs booster study suggests people‚Äôs antibody levels rise five- to 10-fold after a third dose, compared to their second dose months earlier.</em></p>
<p><em>In April, Pfizer flagged plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency authorization of a third dose, as Breitbart News reported.</em></p>
<p><em>‚ÄúWe believe that the third dose will raise the antibody response 10- to 20- fold,‚Äù Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said at the time, likening it to the annual flu shot.</em></p>
<p><em>‚ÄúEvery year, you need to go to get your flu vaccine,‚Äù Bourla said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be the same with COVID. In a year, you will have to go and get your annual shot for Covid to be protected.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>According to the VAERS government website there have been a total of 6,985 reported deaths from the COVID vaccine in the US so far this year.</p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data/mortality"><strong>3, 988 deaths</strong></a> in the US from the Pfizer vaccine so far this year.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE‚Äì</strong> The CDC and FDA <a href="https://hotair.com/allahpundit/2021/07/09/cdc-and-fda-rebuke-pfizer-no-vaccinated-americans-dont-need-a-booster-right-now-n401312"><strong>rebuked Pfizer</strong></a> today. Maybe it was all the deaths?"</p></p>
