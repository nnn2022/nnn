    <strong>Are boomers brain dead?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm just wondering if other folks are having the same experiences with boomer relatives and friends.</p>
<p>They all seem to genuinely believe everything is okay and there's nothing to worry about. When I provide (solicited) sources they suddenly don't have time to read them or bend over backwards to invalidate the sources. Even when trying to discuss Trudeau's latest edict regarding mandatory quarantine upon returning to Canada I'm told, "that's just sensationalism" as if the man himself didn't dictate it.</p>
<p>I've even had boomers agree with my premise that the things being done to the word via medical dictatorship are wrong at best, and human rights abuses at worst, and then turn around and tell me I shouldn't be worried. </p>
<p>Are they brain dead or do they see something I don't? I really don't get it.</p></p>

        <p>My brother. There is a prophecy in Islam that says Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Years of treachery will come over people in which liars are believed and the truthful are denied, the deceitful are trusted and the trustworthy are considered traitors, and the disgraceful will deliver speeches.” It was said, “Who are the disgraceful?” The Prophet said, “Petty men with authority over the common people.” Source: Sunan Ibn Mājah 4036 Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Albani.</p>
<p>Indeed. And that's what we see today around Us. These doomers are fake fools which the elite (the liars) are making a fool of and these people getting played like a piano and still don't realize it. May God have Mercy.</p>

        <p>Romans 1:18-28 can be interpreted to say that if you reject the truth continually (“men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth”), God gives you up to sexual lust. Which, tbh, explains a lot.</p>

        <p>In the words of H. P. Lovecraft, the most merciful thing about the human mind is its inability to correlate all its contents. If most people really put together and seriously considered what's happening to them under the auspices of COVID prevention, they would probably go insane - crushed by despair, consumed with rage, rendered inert by helplessness, or suchlike. Denial like you describe is, very literally, a defense mechanism by the brain to prevent them from reaching that fatal realization and having a mental break.</p>

        <p>The problem my friend, and it extends beyond boomers, is that their whole lives they have grown up to watch legacy media and follow what they say. And it has served them well in their lives. They likely got good jobs, bought a nice house, had a nicefamily etc.. So if their worldview (based on legacy media) has served them well til now why would they change?</p>

        <p>They do not want to admit that they allowed what has come to be to occur under their own watch. Easier to blame it on the younger generations which funnily enough...they raised.</p>

        <p>Yes by following the oligarchy owned news they have literally created a disaster for the younger generations.  Prosperous for them but in terms of long term strategies for maintaining a society they didn't give the best advice.  Probably because the entire system is bent toward extracting the most money in the shortest amount of time.</p>

        <p>This is becoming very apparent. I don't think it's a coincidence that distrust in the media is at such a high point now (like 6/10 americans don't trust it). Clearly, boomers are starting to age out, and the newer generations just do not watch that shit. Actually gives me the barest thread of hope, but I'll hold my breathe.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, this was always one of my assumptions, so I was pleased to show Tucker Carlson's segment on Trudope's new edict to my mother and uncle. They usually like Tucker so I thought this would be a way to meet them on their level. Now the point is that American media can't be trusted (we're Canadian). This interaction actually motivated me to write this post. I think the guy with the "defense mechanism" reply was probably correct.</p>

<p>Also I will say, you Americans really do well with how much bullshit you have to deal with. Don't let anyone, American or otherwise disparage you. Most other countries would have lost the drive to persevere through what you're dealing with ages ago. I wish you luck and offer you confidence.</p>
