    <strong>I have to rant.</strong>
    <p><p>I am not a Covid denier. I had it. I have several friends that had it. I actually know a couple in their 90s who had it; he was battling lung cancer... the 'rona wasn't even enough to get him... he's still around. I just talked with him on the phone last night.</p>
<p>I am not the picture of health but I do get a little exercise, I rarely eat fast food, I drink in moderation, I don't smoke and I almost never eat sugar. I got Covid in December and it was exactly like the flu from 3 years ago (which I also had and went to the urgent care for) except it only felt that way for about 36 hours. After that, it was like an annoying bronchitis/head-cold for about a week. Whenever I say, "If you're reasonably healthy, it's not that bad." I get all kinds of shit. "500k Americans would disagree", etc. Here's the thing:</p>
<p>Individuals should be better prepared for this type of thing.</p>
<p>Viral mutations and new zoonotic diseases are actually very common in any population of any species and it should always be on our radar. Covid or something like it was bound to happen and we, as humans, should be expecting that as a possibility at all times. Humans should be as prepared as they can be for potential illnesses ravaging the population. If it can happen to pine trees, it can happen to people.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people do not think about their health. They get no exercise and eat shit or drink too much or abuse their bodies with hard drugs or work themselves to death by not sleeping and living on energy drinks.... Then they develop weird cancers and things like diabetes or pass on genes with all kinds of autoimmune blueprints in them, just bizarre stuff that makes us more vulnerable as a species.</p>
<p>Guess what happens to those individuals when a new virus that wants to survive more than the last one begins to proliferate? They die. They were already in bad shape and the new virus has an easier time killing them than it does anyone with a more robust immune system. That is biology in action.</p>
<p>I have sympathy for anyone who has experienced a loss in this time. I really do. If you lost a loved one to Covid, I am sorry. That sucks by any measure and I am sorry it happened. But we need to be real. The chances are very high that individual was unhealthy when they contracted the virus. And I am tired of this fact being glossed over because I also have tremendous sympathy for every small business owner who has had his personal economy wrecked forever by the hysterical over-reaction to this damned viral mutation. Those men and women busted their asses for how many decades in order to create something - a better life for their family, a sense of self-worth, a boon to their own local economy - only to have it ripped out of their hands through no fault of their own? They took care of themselves. They handled their obligations. They worked hard and prepared themselves and now they and their families are suffering.  And for many of them, the prospect of prosperity for their future generations, which they worked for, is now gone forever.</p>
<p>Is it fair or just that these people can have their livelihoods stripped away from them (while those dollars went to enrich global corporations like Pfizer, Amazon and Delta, mind you) after they worked so hard to prepare themselves, all in the name of protecting the portion of the population that hasn't given a thought to taking care of themselves for at a least a generation or two?</p></p>

        <p>I never deny that it <em>exists,</em> per se. I do say that it's no different than a bad cold regularly, and people say "I KNOW SOMEONE WHO DIIIIIEEEEDDDD!!" I remind them that people die of the cold, too, when they're unhealthy.</p>

        <p>Business is changed forever. Now, someone starting a new business or even working as a new employee has to be aware that the government can deem you non-essential at any time, and pull the rug out from under you. Even if this lockdown ends, every business owner still has to structure their business differently as a precaution. One of the unfortunate permanent results of this reality.</p>

        <p>I had it too - I have described it just as you did basically. The worst fever I ever had  which just zonked me out for about a whole day. Followed by the biggest craving for pizza I've ever had. Followed by about a couple of weeks of mild to intermediate bronchitis. "Deadly pandemic" = joke.</p>

        <p>I definitely understand your frustration. </p>
<p>My family and I also had COVID. It was a really difficult time, my grandma nearly died and.. to be honest, I feel nothing anymore. </p>
<p>The biggest problem here is the government’s inability to work <strong>THROUGH</strong> the virus and not <strong>WITH</strong> the virus. A lot of incompetence and special interests involved. </p>
<p>There are so many more effective ways to deal with the situation that do <strong>NOT</strong> need a lockdown, yet they’re being completely tossed out the window. Because it doesn’t suit them. Why? I do not know. </p>
<p>Maybe they’re hoping that the pharmaceutical business will cover the impending / already existing financial crisis. Who knows. This is fucked.</p>

        <p>I generally agree with this.  The only thing I take issue with is I don't think you need to be so hard on people in poor health.  Everyone's health takes a hit at some point.  Life is hard.  It's generally not because someone didn't try hard enough, it's because life kicked the stuffing out of them.  I'm not saying people bear no responsibility for their health, but they also don't have total control over it.</p>
