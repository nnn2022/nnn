        <p>China cannot be blamed for our cowardice. Sure, they should have told the truth to begin with but we're a year in and anyone with a calculator can see this isn't what they thought it was - and yet, they keep on trucking.</p>
<p>This is on our "leaders". They failed us. They profited from our fear and they kept pushing lies. It is they who need to pay for this.</p>
<p>As for China? We just need to stop buying their shit to send them back to the stone age.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's cowardice they don't fear they know it's just not that bad it's more the fault of not being honest and staying manipulative instead.</p>
<p>There's just one simple thing that could be done to stop all this nonsense and that's by just being honest and actually telling the people what's really going on in their country instead of lying.</p>
<p>I don't blame China but recently us diplomats just took the anal swab and the anal swab is china's idea that's like literally being fucked in the ass by China.</p>

        <p>This video shows how about 350-400 million Chinese live. What about the other 1 billion? The Chinese don't want you to see how they are living.</p>

        <p>350-400 million is still as high as the population of the whole USA and West Europe together right?? but there's indeed a lot of poor parts in the country they don't want you to see and they have unfinished ghost cities (big cities with no people living in it)</p>
<p>But the economy is going up in China while our businesses is going down because of covid restrictions and we need to rely on government loans because of a virus made up by China for control and China is somehow the first to cure everyone from covid without a vaccine, they were even partying while our clubs has to shutdown and we are being restricted to have parties.</p>
<p>Now they are giving out anal swabs and people are gonna let China f**k them in the ass.</p>
