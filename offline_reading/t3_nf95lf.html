        <p>Thanx for posting it. I believe him in this case. Looking at all the studies from 2002-2016 regarding the covsars1 vaccines trials, ADE was the great problem and the next wild „normal“ killed only the vaccinated testing animals, not the unvaccinated...</p>

        <p>Montagnier is of the biggest mass murderers in the history of mankind, completely faking the isolation of the alleged hiv virus, killing millions with drugs that were completely unnecessary for the people with aids (just quitting the recreational drugs and improving nutritional status would have saved them). And now, Covid is aids all over. The same crappy tests, the same BS disease definition, Fauci, etc.</p>
<p>Watch House of Numbers, to see all these virology wankers show that there is no isolated hiv virus to begin with. Covid idem.</p>

        <p>Yup, I don’t trust Montagnier.</p>
<p>Kary Mullis, Fauci and Montagnier critic, died of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/science/kary-b-mullis-dead.html">“pneumonia” 3 days before Gates’ pal Epstein.</a>  </p>
<p>Kary Mullis on HIV/AIDS:</p>
<p><strong>“They don’t know. Nobody really knows. This whole thing is a big sham. It’s ridiculous.”</strong></p>
<p>Mullis asks Dr. Luc Montagnier for a reference stating ‘HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.’</p>
<p>“So, I didn’t get any more out of him, he (<strong>Montagnier</strong>) walked away after that. And the people standing around, by the way who were his colleagues there, looked at him thinking like he should come up with a better answer than that but he couldn’t and he just turned around and walked away.  I really thought he’d have an answer.  I really did! I mean, that was my last... I was right at the edge of my faith in the system... but I thought Montagnier will know why he thinks HIV causes it and he will tell me, ‘it’s because of this study,’ you know? But he didn’t have that.  None of those guys have that and that’s why they’re so weird, you know? That’s why they don’t want to say... they don’t want people like me walking up and asking those kinds of questions and they’re willing to go to great lengths to prevent that. They’re out on a limb.  I wouldn’t want to be there with them.”</p>
<p>-Dr. Kary Mullis, PCR inventor 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W0XpMYMX0CM</p>
<h2>Mullis was a bioweapons consultant that had once toured Ft. Detrick</h2>
<p>&rt;<strong>"I could spray anthrax right out this window</strong> and nobody would even know it," <strong>Mullis says.</strong> "We need to be thinking about that."</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Mullis is thinking about anthrax</strong> and other biological weapons because he's consulting for a company that's seeking a federal contract to study biological warfare. <strong>This morning, he toured Fort Detrick,</strong> in Frederick, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1998/11/03/nobel-chemist-kary-mullis-making-waves-as-a-mind-surfer/31e7e720-44e4-49ff-8458-a9822cdcb47e/">where military scientists research the issue.”</a></p>
<p><strong>2 days before Mullis’ death The NY Times reported:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/health/germs-fort-detrick-biohazard.html">“Deadly Germ Research Is Shut Down at Army Lab Over Safety Concerns”</a></p>
<p><strong>Mullis: A Fauci Critic</strong></p>
<p>“They’ve got a personal kind of agenda. They make up their own rules as they go. They change them when they want to, and smugly... like <strong>Tony Fauci does not mind going on television, in front of the people that pay his salary, and lie directly into the camera.”</strong></p>
<p>-Kary Mullis
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5aISPlTLbJo</p>
<p>“What ABC needs to do,” says Mullis, “is talk to Fauci and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html">Gallo</a> and <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">show that they’re assholes, which I could do in ten minutes.”</a></p>
<p>Kary Mullis also stated:</p>
<p><strong>”People keep asking me, ‘You mean you don’t believe that HIV causes AIDS?’ And I say, ’Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant! I have no scientific evidence for it!’</strong> I might believe in God, and He could have told me in a dream that HIV causes AIDS. But I wouldn’t stand up in front of scientists and say, ‘I believe HIV causes AIDS because God told me.’ I’d say, ‘I have papers here in hand and experiments that have been done that can be demonstrated to others.’ It’s not what somebody believes, it’s experimental proof that counts. And <strong>neither Montagnier, Gallo, nor anyone else had published papers describing experiments which led to the conclusion that HIV probably caused AIDS.”</strong></p>
<p>Mullis even had the opportunity do ask <strong>Montagnier</strong> personally about a reference proving that HIV causes AIDS. But he couldn’t name one. “It was damned irritating,“ as <strong>Mullis reported. “If Montagnier didn’t know the answer, who the hell did?“</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/10/27/anthony-fauci-40-years-of-lies-from-azt-to-remdesivir/">Anthony Fauci: 40 Years of Lies From AZT to Remdesivir</a></p>
<h2>Mullis recounts asking Montagnier for a reference</h2>
<p><strong>”Finally, I had an opportunity to question one of the giants in HIV and AIDS research, DL Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute,</strong> when he gave a talk in San Diego. It would be the last time I would be able to ask my little question without showing anger, and I figured Montagnier would know the answer. So I asked him.</p>
<p><strong>With a look of condescending puzzlement, Montagnier said, "Why don't you quote the report from the Centers for Disease Control? "</strong></p>
<p><strong>I replied, "It doesn't really address the issue of whether or not HIV is the probable cause of AIDS, does it?"</strong></p>
<p><strong>”No," he admitted, no doubt wondering when I would just go away.</strong> He looked for support to the little circle of people around him, but they were all awaiting a more definitive response, like I was.</p>
<p><strong>”Why don't you quote the work on SIV [Simian Immunodeficiency Virus]?" the good doctor offered.</strong></p>
<p><strong>”I read that too, DL Montagnier," I responded. "What happened to those monkeys didn't remind me of AIDS. Besides, that paper was just published only a couple of months ago. I'm looking for the original paper where somebody showed that HIV caused AIDS.</strong></p>
<p>This time, DL <strong>Montagnier's response was to walk quickly away to greet an acquaintance across the room.”</strong>
http://www.duesberg.com/viewpoints/kintro.html</p>
<p>“Everybody was looking at the blood of an AIDS patient and finding it crawling with some new organism and said, ‘hey, this is this virus that we call HIV now.’”</p>
<p>“All kinds of diseases started coming into the AIDS family, faster than anyone should’ve been comfortable with, really.  To go from two or three to go to 30 in a few years was like <strong>somebody should’ve said, ‘hey, there’s something wrong here and it’s got to be financial.’ Things don’t happen that fast in science!</strong> You don’t suddenly notice that one new organism is causing every problem.”</p>

        <p>If you believe in the virus, and variants, and all the scare stories, yes, Montagnier makes sense. </p>
<p>If you don't, then it's just another lie, indirectly supporting the idea of the deadly pandemic. Which is what he is really doing. You can see him laughing through his eyes. He knows exactly what kind of scam covid is. This is one of the key bought scientists. He will play whatever role is needed. This makes him look smart again, the French will love this.</p>
