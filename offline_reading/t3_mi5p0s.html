    <strong>If govt pass a law where you are able to kill a person that doesnt wear mask in public i think people would do that without problem</strong>
    <p><p>The past couple of days how i have seen many people are getting attacked for not wearing masks, which sounds "WAY SMARTER THEN TO AVOID THEM IF YOU ARE SCARED" but no touching them and making them bleed is way safer to protect urself from something that ur scared to death..</p>
<p>I do start to feel if the Govt passes a law where you are allowed to kill  people without a maskes in public people will actually do without any problem and go nuts about it or maybe even brag but they cry in comments on social media about my uncle Joe not wearing  a mask, i really wonder how empty braindead u gotta be to do that, seems so illogical to me but so logical to them..</p></p>

        <p>It can work both ways, sure it's possible to get enough people angry at the other side cause they pose an unacceptable risk that needs to be eliminated...</p>
<p>1) Pro maskers could be lead to believe, anti maskers are a bunch of irredeemable conspiracy nuts who selfishly don't care about taking precautions to help stop the spread of the virus as they post their mis-information memes on covid on reddit. WE NEED TO STOP THIS BEFORE ITS TOO LATE !!!</p>
<p>2) Anti maskers could be lead to believe, pro maskers are sheeple controlled by satan/biden/msm who are enabling the coming communist state operated by the pedophile cabal deep state where you will own nothing and no small business will exist and christianity will be made illegal, unless they are illegal mexicans coming over the boader who will rape you and steal your job, WE NEED TO STOP THIS BEFORE ITS TOO LATE !!!</p>

        <p>Google anything that doesn’t align with your left leaning views, it’ll be “fact checked” or sensored because words and thoughts that don’t align with your own are dangerous. How dare you other siders say something that is not on CNN lol</p>
