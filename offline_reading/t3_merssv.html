    <strong>Vaccine Passport - Lesser evil?</strong>
    <p><p>At this stage, we are likely to see a vaccine passport system used in many countries as the world starts to reopen. I expect it to be particularly prevalent in anything related to travel and hospitality. If/when these systems come about, what would be the lesser evil; a centralized, standardized system maintained and regulated at a state or national level, or a system that gives individual businesses more power to pick and choose?<br>
 I'm picturing something something similar to what we have in Aus where a business can choose to enforce a dress code (shirt required for service) or disallow intoxicated people on the premise. Not all enforce these rules, but as intoxication is not a protected class it gives businesses the option to prohibit intoxicated people from entering. This could allow businesses to decide if enforcing vaccine requirements. The main shortcoming I see is that either the vaccine check system is either centralized, or potentially worse, maintained on a per business basis. This is likely more expensive on the business end, and provides more exposed targets that can be hacked.   </p>
<p>While thinking about this, I found myself asking, how is refusal of service based on vaccination status different to any other refusal of service? In Australia you can refuse service for anything that isn't protected by anti-discrimination law (age, sexual orientation, gender, race, disability).</p></p>

        <p>Given health privacy laws, I’m not sure how it’s legal to ask at as all. Interesting court cases coming. Imagine the other things they will start to add to these health passes as folks become more comfortable with the practice.</p>

        <p>Well that was my first thought too, I shouldn't have to disclose health information, except we already do, admittedly in a more limited capacity. Usually it's pretty frivolous, things like business refusing service to pregnant women trying to go on rollercoasters, Bungy jumping, etc, or not being able to enter certain entertainment venues if you have epilepsy. A recent one for me was not being allowed into a wastewater processing site until I could prove I was vaccinated against hepatitis and tetnas. It's all done in the name of safety and risk minimisation. A pregnant lady going Bungy jumping isn't a death sentence for the baby, just a risk. There was no guarantee I would be exposed to hepatitis, just a small risk of it, but in both cases they are legally (and morally) required minimise that risk of harm. While we may never know the number, some people have died of covid, some have damaged respiratory systems thus covid has risk. How is it different when businesses try to protect customers and minimise their risk of being exposed. Compare it to a pub kicking out an intoxicated patron who is getting a bit aggressive. There is incentive for the pub to keep him there, once he is drunk he will want more drinks, but they have to kick him out lest he risk harm patrons or staff. He might never become violent but they have to act to minimise the risk. A good bouncer already gets a snapshot of your health status when they ask/check if you are drunk before letting you enter the venue. If you look at it as a business having an obligation to protect customers and staff you already see people disclosing their health status pretty often. The big difference here is you can't just lie if there is a vaccine passport, they can just check. </p>
<p>I'm beginning to see the vaccine pass as the PPE I had to wear at the wastewater site - I was already vaccinated against hepatitis, I was working away from the contaminated sites, even if I was exposed it's only a small chance of infection, yet I still had to wear PPE. In the end I was accidentally exposed, but I was fine. I'll never know if I was protected by the PPE, the vaccine or just random chance, but I'm greatful for every line of defence I had. Even if the risk to customers and staff is small, shouldn't a business have the option to try to protect its people. Beyond wanting to keep their customers happy and healthy so they keep coming back, look at it from the staff perspective - either their boss has the vaccine pass setup, or their boss is happy to roll the dice and risk getting them sick, which would make them loose work, wrack up medical bills and have a chance of permanent damage. Just to make a few more sales to those without their vaccine pass. Would you be happy working with a boss so willing to gamble on your health?</p>

        <p>You wrote a novel to not say much, honestly. This is not about protecting public health and is just another system of control that will start with covid vaccinations and grow from there. But you do you, I’m going to hang with the unwashed masses yearning to breathe free.</p>

        <p>I laid out the legal precedent for medical disclosure, and how it's an extention of risk mitigation but sure. Come, join the rest of the world outside, breathing free. It's so wild how countries with real, strict covid control policies all seemed to fair better. Crazy. I've worn a mask 4 times in the last 3 months, and over the whole pandemic less than 15 hours total. While you all bicker about how empathy is tyranny the rest of the world is already most of the way back to normal.</p>

        <p>All we need is for some 'based' business that knows it's going to go out of business due to finances to start requiring proof of pap smears, colonoscopy, or weight-loss program, and then have someone sue them, and take to supreme court. Then if they strike this down due to health privacy, they must apply it to the vaccine as well.</p>

        <p>I don't know about the US, but for Aus you wouldn't be able to sue for that, on the basis that you chose to take your business to that company, which means you also have to opt in to giving up your medical records. They could always make it a company requirement that you provide your medical info, but as long as the consumer has the option to just not do business with the company (like just picking any other company), the right to privacy isn't being infringed on.You could 100% sue them into the ground if they ever disclosed your medical information though. </p>
<p>Think of it like applying for a job that requires a working with children check. You are never required to allow someone to preform one on you, but if you apply for a job that requires a the check, the process of applying gives consent for them to do the check.</p>
