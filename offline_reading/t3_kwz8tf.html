    <strong>1 visitor only and mask policies for labor and delivery..</strong>
    <p><p>I'm noticing a lot of hospitals around where we live and were going to move, all have weird hospital policies. Most say masks have to be worn at least on the way to the room. I can't breathe in them so wearing one during labor for me sounds dangerous, even on the way to the room. And they all say I can't have more than 1 person in the room. Policies like that show me they don't care about their patients' rights. What would they do if I refused a mask, or anything else? And I really need more than 1 person allowed in. In my situation that's absolutely not realistic. I thought it was just 1 person only in blue states and like NC, but even in Georgia where I looked they're doing that. Maybe I missed some. I need to find a hospital though. Last time I got stuck in a hospital without family or friends to do this the end result was medical malpractice. Can someone recommend a hospital, preferably in the eastern US that won't make me wear a mask and will let more than 1 person in with me?</p></p>

        <p>I don't know of hospitals, but have you considered a birth center? I believe they tend to be much more patient focused. How any woman in labor would wear a mask for even a sec is just beyond me. I truly believe I would assault the crap out of a nurse/dr that tried to make that happen.</p>

        <p>If a pregnant woman is pressured into a medical intervention she is uncomfortable with on labor it's called, 'obstetric violence'. Our medical system has been bursting with butcher's, from before the plandemic, so obstetric violence is not technically illegal, however you can report it and a few women have collected damages. There is a thing called an unattended birth in the hospital, which, happens frequently because of general neglect to women in labor. </p>
<p>You're giving the world a great gift, against all obstacles. Thank you. Say no to face diaper &amp; let 'Em know, No means No.</p>

        <p>This happened to my friend's daughter in NY. Her Mom took her home with the intention of finding a better hospital and ended up birthing at home, no masks and surrounded by family. </p>
<p>I hope you find what you need!</p>
