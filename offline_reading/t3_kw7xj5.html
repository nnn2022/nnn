    <strong>Updated: Proof the UK government is falsifying covid death numbers using only public official data with references. I think ive cracked it.</strong>
    <p><p>Since people asked for a bit more information, here goes. I will include anything from the origional post aswell  for those who havent seen it.</p>
<p>I  downloaded all of the publicly available documents and data regarding  covid and compiled it myself and began notice major inconsistencies. It  would be very long winded to go into it all now, but it is something I  am currently writing up.  But for now I would like to show you the  following:</p>

<p>So I checked and the UK government actually issued guidence regarding those statistics:</p>

<p>Prior  to the 28th of april there is no testing data as mass covid testing was  nowhere near up and running so none of those deaths had a positive  test. And yet the government dont seem to have gotten the message and  PHE only started checking death certificates from the 29th.    The data and methodology behind how they were calculated appear to be NOWHERE.Of the 80,000 claimed  mortalities, over 45,000 of them were in april and the first half of  may, peaking at over 1,000 per day according the 2020 Death statistics:</p>

<p>However, the data for those who had died after a covid test was available. 651.</p>

<p>The last of the mystery may as deaths are registered 11 days after the end of the week of the 28th.  Thats the 15th of may.The first peak didnt happen. The first peak that justified the first and second lockdowns. Didnt happen.Prior to the 28th april there was no standardised method of recording a Covid death.</p>
<p>However! Here is the UK government dashboard claiming over half of them as deaths who died within 28 days of a positive test! Anecdotally this chimes with the fact that nurses and doctors were actually saying that the hospitals were quieter than usual because everybody thought that they were over run!</p>

<p>Here again we have the goverment EXPLICITY STATING that the 45,000 tests prior to this had been tested.When infact, all that was required was for the care home operater who are not medical professionals, to inform the ONS that it was "covid related".  And thats that, covid death registered.</p>
<p>However below we see, that infect the number of covid deaths in the weeks shown are EXACTLY equal to the number of care home residents who died during that peroid.</p>

There certainly seems to be a correlation between the number of care home residents who died in all settings and the number of covid deaths in england prior to the changes made in april filtering through. I speculate that perhaps almost every care home death was at some point registered as a covid death due to the non standardised and inconsistent methods of recording one. </p>
<p>But the story does not end here.  After a long peroid involving very few covid deaths, it all changed when the definition of a covid death was changed, in the words of Public health england to   "Get as comprehensive measure of mortality as possible".On august the 12th the following was issued.</p>

<p>Along side new instructions on how healthcare professionals should fill out the death certificates:<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/877302/guidance-for-doctors-completing-medical-certificates-of-cause-of-death-covid-19.pdf">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/877302/guidance-for-doctors-completing-medical-certificates-of-cause-of-death-covid-19.pdf</a>This  is nothing short of an active deception of the public with full  knowledge of their actions.  How is this more not widely known? Some  people I have mentioned it to seem to agree with it saying "well if it  makes people take it more seriously its a good thing". That almost  melted my brain.</p>

<p>In this same document, Doctors were told not to register a death as either old age or natural causes.</p>
<p>A combination of hugely expanded definition of what counts as a covid death, especially including it on a death certificate beyond 60 days or specifically any cause of death within 28 days, comined with mass testing which lead to an increase of cases, lead us to here.</p>
<p>https://preview.redd.it/lzoehx2fn0b61.png?width=698&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69b8b63cc1162496380756102657501f6ccc9b76</p>
<p>The red marker being the point these changes were made.</p>
<p>Interstingly, despite the steep climb in deaths since then, this time around, excess deaths remain baseline.</p>
<p>The first peak of  covid is considered a "warning" of how bad things can get, and we are  constantly reminded with the image of that rapid climb to 1000+ deaths  from covid per day.  Only, that didnt actually happen.</p>

<p>This  is just the tip of the iceberg of how utterly shamelessly the  government have been massaging the statistics to keep the crisis in full  swing.</p>
<p>I believe this is now irrefutable. The correlation between care home deaths in all settings and the covid death numbers prior to 15th of may, on top of the sketchy data to back it up. Its too much to deny now.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

        <p>Tests in my country went up 50% since last week while PCR-positives went up 18%. They called it an "alarming rise of cases." Yeah, that's not how maths work. </p>
<p>Either way PCR-positives are meaningless at 40 cycles.</p>

        <p>I can't believe this is real honestly. I thought the lockdowns were unjustifiable based on the numbers being true. I looked into them because i figured they were probably padded a bit, was not expecting to find this though.<br>
Well over 50% of the UK registered deaths were neither seen by a medical professional or had a test.</p>

        <p>I didn't read your post in detail but am familiar with how the numbers are doctored. Your analysis seems thorough, especially compared to the numbers they feed us on TV. As I said, I think their next move will be gulag villages. Our next move will probably be sitting on our arses waiting for more amazon boxes, unless if you have a better idea? </p>
<p>It's too painful for people to admit to themselves that the government is lying to them, so we block it out the same way a child that is abused by its parents blocks those memories out. You're preaching to the choir here but it'll be like talking to a wall if you show this to the indoctrinated.</p>

        <p>I've spent 4 days now going into way more depth than this. Im writing a paper to academic standard in the hopes of somehow getting it to the scientific community. But I also want to produce something for the lay person...Honestly, there isnt a single bit of speculation in here.  I dunno man...this seems real. If it is, fuck it, the end game of this is a living nightmare, might aswell give every ounce of energy we have and go out swinging right?</p>

        <p>Just read the full post. Good work. The writing is a bit unclear at times but the numbers speak for themselves. </p>
<p>I noticed that the definition of covid deaths in 4.1.1b allows for people who tested negative to be classified as covid deaths as long as the death certificate says they died "during the covid-19 pandemic".  Anyone who was tested and died can be counted, because it doesn't say "positive specimen", just "specimen".</p>
<p>&rt; This is nothing short of an active deception of the public with full knowledge of their actions.  </p>
<p>Yeah, so? How is this surprising? Have you been following politics for the last 5000 years? </p>
<p>&rt; How is this more not widely known?  </p>
<p>It is. Most people seem to know the numbers are doctored, but they either assume it's for their own good or they realise they can't do much about it. </p>
<p>&rt; Some people I have mentioned it to seem to agree with it saying "well if it makes people take it more seriously its a good thing". That almost melted my brain. </p>
<p>This is big brain logic: we'll pretend like it's worse than it is so people take it more seriously even though we know the proof for that is fake. Mind you, I think this virus is real and is (or at least used to be) similar to or worse than HIV. The thing is, HIV doesn't have high mortality rates the first few years, so people won't take it seriously if we don't prop the numbers up.  And if people don't take it seriously there's no money or power to be gained. Long covid is a thing, not all of it is just a generalized anxiety syndrome created by lockdowns. </p>
<p>No coroner required, great! That means a coroner won't be required to see if the vaccine was the cause of death or not, we can just have a volunteer say it's a covid death ("yes, it happened during the covid pandemic") and autopsy over. Because we want as many people as possible to take the vaccine, so it'd be a nightmare if we were scared of it. </p>
<p>&rt; Interstingly, despite the steep climb in deaths since then, this time around, excess deaths remain baseline. </p>
<p>This is very important. We deliberately wrecked social, cultural and economical life to save next to noone. </p>
<p>&rt; we are constantly reminded with the image of that rapid climb to 1000+ deaths from covid per day. Only, that didnt actually happen. </p>
<p>It did. On paper. History will only remember the victors and we might not be among them. </p>
<p>Really, take care of yourself and your family. And don't take any free train tickets from strangers.</p>

        <p>Thank you for reading this and your detailed reply.  I've been rather disheartened by the number of people in my personal life, who while claiming to oppose lockdowns/be skeptical of the government and their role in the pandemic dont extend that sentiment beyond not giving a fuck.<br>
And the remainder who openly admit that they can't handle thinking about it because they are struggling with day to day life so much already.<br>
I totally get both, but there doesnt seem to be many left who have not retreated into total avoidance.</p>

        <p>You've done a good job but as you allude to, we knew all this back at the beginning.  The truth is this isn't about a virus, and that if you put this in front of anyone who isn't already awake, at best you'll get a shrug and change of subject, at worst abused and ostracised, as I was by many of my former friends in March last year when I proved the Italian death numbers were also heavily manipulated prior to 23rd March lockdown.  We're in clown world now, so buckle up and maybe I'll see you in the gulag.</p>

        <p>I attend protests (difficult, they are illegal and police are very aggressive, acting like thugs arresting anyone), I associate only with like minded people. Until there is a groundswell of public outrage against all of this, there isn't anything much more to be done when the vast majority agree with it and refuse to see the truth.  We just need to group together in real life and protect ourselves as best we can.</p>

        <p>"Prior to the 28th of april there is no testing data as mass covid testing was nowhere near up and running so none of those deaths had a positive test." So, because mass testing wasn't up and running, you think they weren't testing people in hospitals? You think that because there weren't hundreds of thousands of tests available a week, that there were actually ZERO tests and that if there were any tests, they wouldn't be using them on the people in hospital? This is your line of reasoning and actually pretty critical to your point. Do you not see how this is absolute nonsense?</p>
<p>Later on you write about how the deaths are "EXACTLY equal to the number of care home residents that died" when they quite clearly are not. In each week the COVID deaths are less than half. Another key point in your argument which is actual nonsense. The best thing about this one is that you've just lied, then screenshotted the evidence that shows that you're wrong and provided it as evidence that you're right. It's just bizarre. How is it possible for you to look at two wildly different numbers then argue that they're the same?</p>

        <p>I included the number of deaths in hospitals which had tested positive in the post. They account for very few.
And the total deaths of care home residents in all settings added up, equal the covid deaths.</p>

<p>You can literally get all of the positive tested covid deaths in hospitals by date of death here.   </p>
<p>In the graph I included as an example, on the 25th of april, just over patients who had tested positive for covid died in hospital.</p>

        <p>Specifically reference the sums that you did that show that the numbers are the same. Do it or admit that you're lying. You've already done it of course and being so detailed with your post, there's no way that you've deleted the spreadsheet you used so just screenshot it and show us.</p>

        <p>I have done as you asked.  It is all publicly available information you are welcome to check. Thank you for highlighting this point however, as I realise it is pure speculation and was simply an intriguing consideration in trying to work out where the deaths prior to the april 28th change in death recording.</p>
<p>Please, try to be civilized. I can assure you I would much rather the situation be what it appears taken at face value, it is much simpler and easier to cope with on both a personal and societal level, and am more than happy to take any new information anyone can provide into consideration and change my views accordingly.</p>
<p>I notice you havent addressed the primary point though, that the goverment hub shows that 80,000+ people died within 28 days of recieving a covid test. When, In reality the majority of them occured before the Aprils change, and as shown were either notified to the CQC as "involving covid" which is so vague as to be meaningless, or where there was mention of covid anywhere on the death certificate.</p>
<p>I provided the links to the number of deaths in hospitals who had recieved a test during that time, and also to the technical manual containing the note regarding the statistics prior to april 28th.</p>
<p>The fact that the statement remains on the government site, is directly misleading.</p>
<p>Furthermore how can you doubt that a government who have openly exploited the pandemic by embezzeling millions of taxpayer money with shoddy contract for ppe to their mates with a track record of open deception and self interestedness. Surely you must conceed that it is not beyond the realms of possibility for them to manipulate the situation in a way like this?</p>

<p>Where? You literally have not because you can not. It's a lie, you are wrong. At this point you know that you're lying but you're doubling down.</p>
<p>Why would I adress the clearly nonsense "primary point" when it supported by such flimsy and nonsensical arguments. I'm not going to tell you that your house looks bad, I don't need to because there's no foundations and therefore, no house. Just an illusion of one build on nothing at all.</p>
<p>Why be civilised? You're deliberately spreading lies then doubling down. Nothing about what you're doing is civilised, regardless of how you coat it.</p>

<p>You are lying, show me the evidence for what you said ----&rt; I refuse to acknowledge the evidence for what you have said because you are lying.</p>
<p>There is nothing in this post that I have not provided the source material for. And nothing that I have said that isnt directly supported by said material.  If I was lying, and that lie is as destructive as you claim it to be, it should be very easy to refute me. Surely that would be the right thing to do?

        <p>You haven't actually provided the evidence. The numbers quite literally are not the same. For two weeks they're similar, that's all. Not the same and not a pattern. You can't just spit out evidence that contradicts what you said and expect me to accept it. I couldn't even get to circular reasoning because you can't get past the first step of supporting your statement.</p>
