    <strong>A Rant Really</strong>
    <p><p>What’s the point of this subreddit? This is a genuine question because the description isn’t clear because from the looks of it, it seems like you guys can’t grasp the fact this is how it’s going to be and with selfish attitudes and ignorance like yours, we aren’t going to return to what we were a year ago. Stfu and wear a mask. Cases are spiking around the world and you pigheaded fools think that it’s a good time to be selfish and not wear one but let me tell you something, these mask mandates and social distancing rules aren’t for you, they are for everyone around you. They are for you friends, family and everyone that you care for but you want to be a stubborn, reckless, selfish pig. But you know what, keep not wearing a mask. Keep not social distancing and see where that takes you. If you catch the virus, I hope you survive and have to live through all the pain and suffering that comes with it. I hope you live and realise how stupid you were for being so stubborn because you couldn’t wear a mask so you could buy your big mac.</p></p>

        <p>I think a lot of people have forgotten what it means to have individual opinions. It seems that the cases are very high right now but the deaths remain quite low (meaning practically everyone is getting over the virus) which is fantastic news. Most of the world is still taking many precautions but the numbers are still soaring because trying to hide from something as widespread and contagious as COVID is futile IMO. I have been working, going to stores, eating out (before they closed restaurants in MI again), being with friends and family, and still haven’t gotten it or known anyone in my close circle who has gotten it. I would be shocked if I haven’t been exposed to it to the degree that I could have been infected and there is also a good chance that I may have already had it asymptotically. What I’m trying to say here is that the precious plan to “slow/stop the spread” is not effective. Herd immunity should be the next step so that everyone develops a resistance to it. We can’t keep crippling our world socially and financially over something that is 99% survivable.</p>

        <p>Get off your high horse.  You are no better than anyone here or anyone on the entire planet.  There are people on this sub who are skeptical of ideas such as staying inside when it is proven that vitamin D fresh air and exercise actually boost your immune system.  A lot of people here have rational concerns regarding how the world is going to work years from now.  If you think that once the virus is gone you will continue to have all the same rights beforehand then you are the “pigheaded fool”.  Have some respect for your fellow man.  Unless you have a medical degree then don’t tell people what to do.</p>

        <p>Your health is not my responsibility, as mine is not yours.</p>
<p>How many times have you been sick in your lifetime? How many people do you think you’ve infected with a virus in your lifetime? How many people do you figure have suffered, and sadly, succumbed to those spreads, eventually? There is no stopping a virus, regardless of people’s actions, and I’d bet my last dollar you’ve never bat an eye at the issue prior to this year.</p>
<p>If you spent more time focusing on protecting yourself and your loved ones rather than what complete strangers are doing, you would surely be happier.</p>
