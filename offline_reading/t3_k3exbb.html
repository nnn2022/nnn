    <strong>The End of Travel</strong>
    <p><p>One thing that really breaks my heart about all this is that international travel will never be the same again. Travel was my hobby. When my father died in 2014, travel was what kept me from slipping into that a depression. Everything seemed pointless without him, and I didn't really care about being responsible with my money anymore. In retrospect I spent a lot, but I don't regret the traveling I did. I got to over a dozen countries and over a dozen US states between 2015 and 2019. I traveled solo, stayed in hostels and I met other singles along the way from all over the world. I also cruised a lot with family and made some great memories.</p>
<p>And yet every day that goes by I'm scratching several countries off my list of places I will never get to. Singapore banned talking on public transit. Thailand has banned tourism until 2022 (and you can imagine what it'll be like when they open back up.) Ireland (my country of ancestry) has one of the most draconian lockdowns in Europe. The President of Philippines threatening to shoot people who go outside back in the spring.</p>
<p>Masks and vaccine passports will be required just to get on a plane. Travel will be such a headache that most people will opt not to do it. And the demon Bill Gates and his cronies will have their wish -- a more virtual life where nobody even wants to bother driving to the office because they have to be tested to go to their cubicle.</p>
<p>Barring a miracle, gone are the days of your plane touching down in a foreign country, having a quick conversation with immigration about what brought you to their country, and breathing in that fresh air, with 10 days and absolutely no plans other than following your gut.</p></p>

        <p>I feel the same, there are so many places I would like to visit.  But mostly i find myself having to make some serious decisions. I have brothers and sisters on 3 continents and my parents in 2 different countries. I'm away from my family here in Spain, if I don't want the experimental vaccine, I might have to  move and soon, before they implement the health passport.</p>

        <p>I'm there with you. I have weekly mental breakdowns where I bawl my eyes out because who knows the next time I'll be able to plan a big vacation somewhere new. I love planning and exploring and my heart broke when we had to cancel our big European trip this past summer (one that was planned a year in advance)! I refuse to take the vaccine until it has been tested more - I remember when Gardasil came out and my doctor was pushing me for it but my mom (a nurse who has has worked in hospitals in different countries) was against me taking it and then there were a bunch of reports of horrible side effects. I also don't have an unlimited number of vacation days and because of the type of work my company does I can't take my computer out of the country so quarantining for 10+ days isn't practical. My dad's mother passed away and he can't even go to the funeral because he's afraid of getting stuck in that country.</p>

        <p>Yup. Couldn't attend my grandfather's funeral in NY back in April because the governor, a little tyrant Mussolini wannabe, Andy Cuomo was too busy killing seniors to allow funerals to proceed. My grandfather was healthy as a horse at 93 a month earlier. I think the disruption to his routine and worry caused his heart attack, so I count my grandfather as one of Cuomo's victims.</p>

        <p>I'm very sorry for your loss. I'm shocked with how Cuomo and a few other governors have handled the virus and how much praise they're receiving for it.</p>

        <p>End of travel = end of globalism and globalist agenda. The world with inpenetrable borders will inevitably be deeply nationalist.</p>
<p>Globalists are a powerful force, respresented by China and WEF. So I doubt travel is stopped permanently. Vaccine passports will open the borders again, and this will might actually be another attempt at issuing non-national passports for 'world citizens'</p>

        <p>They can implement their Great Reset without international travel. The internet connects you across the world in seconds. They’re telling us “we’re all in this together. Together alone.” They want us in our homes on the heavily censored internet and watching cable TV. 24/7/365</p>

        <p>Yeah no. Globalism stands on the idea that you can get a better job in Singapore, and then in Geneva, therefore serving your country is sooo last century. If digital nomads can't nomad(move), if travel bloggers can't produce content, if upper middle class girls can't eat-pray-love, you can't feel globalist. 'Taking a vacation on youtube' doesn't count and never did, to get detached from your country you need physical separation.</p>
