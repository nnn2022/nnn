    <strong>My locale just quietly started to mandate outdoor masks - what can I do if anything to defy this overreach?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm in Eastern Ontario Canada, and the head of our local health unit is absolutely loving these lockdown measures and the sudden limelight on his position. In July he mandated masks in all indoor public places due to what he called "popular demand." Now, nowhere covered on our local news or on the health unit's main website, <a href="https://eohu.ca/files/resources/new-section-22-order-restaurants-and-masks-en-2020-09-.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1wjE3yweUiRa8VH8KA4XQ7nmXBGoErsXBqGRBMy5LaPVWgHC1fYQXZx4Q">a PDF is published mandating masks at all outdoor of businesses</a>. This was not seen by many and only days later picked up by a couple of local Facebook users. My guess is this is just the beginning of laying the groundwork to ease this into all outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Has any other locality in The United States or Canada made outdoor mask use mandatory? I absolutely cannot afford the fine (surprise surprise, I'm a working-class person who's lost a lot due to the government's overreaction to a virus), but wish I could do something to point out how ridiculous this has gotten.</p></p>
