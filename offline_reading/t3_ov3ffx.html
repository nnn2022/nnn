    <strong>UK Only Petition: Outlaw discrimination against people who don't want covid 19 vaccination (336k signed so far)</strong>
    <p><p>Hey People of the UK, </p>
<p>If you haven't seen so already the UK parliament website has a petition to Outlaw discrimination against people that don't want the jab. </p>
<p>(anyone that has taken the jab, that's fine, as that's your freedom and your choice) </p>
<p>For everyone else, If you're apposed to the C19 jab, essentially your not happy with the fact the survival rate is over 99% worldwide. </p>
<p>The fact it is an experimental jab, lots of side effects, many possibly life changing and for some life ending. The horror stories so far of blood clots, sudden death of healthy individuals weeks after the jab, some even months after the 2nd jab</p>
<p>The fact your civil liberty's are being destroyed, you as an unvaccinated individual will end up being discriminated against, freedom of movement restricted, freedom of choice eroded, your human rights eradicated. </p>
<p>Soon you'll begin to need papers to prove you've had the jab, some of this has already started with RT PCR tests before you travel abroad, the NHS app has been quietly updated last week with that in mind.</p>
<p>This is very important, why?? People risking losing their jobs, their lively hoods, homes, if the government push this control through, we have to stand for whats important or fall for anything.</p>
<p>This is all a push, to make life harder, to force individuals to get the jab. Just to get it over with and play along.. </p>
<p>But a what cost?! To lives, your family, your friends, your own liberty's </p>
<p>"If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next" ðŸŽ¶ 
(Manic Street Preachers) </p>
<p>If you feel it's important enough the petition has reached over 336,500 signatures. Over the last few weeks. Anything over 100k the government must look at and even debate in Parliament. The bigger the number the bigger the spot light</p>

        <p>This is an old petition. It was already debated in April and is now vestigial. Is there a more current one?</p>

        <p>This I think is still the current one.. As far as I see this hasn't been debated. A petition is closed once its at that stage</p>
