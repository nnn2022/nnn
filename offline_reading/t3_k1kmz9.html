        <p>Next step is rule tyrannical restrictions on business hours, who you gather with, and many many other things unconstitutional at the nationwide level. All executive orders that include such mandates will be null and void unless amended.</p>

        <p>Agreed. That is what the Supreme Court should do. I'm sorry to the people who are 'skwared' to go out but the fact is that this virus, speaking from the experience of having <strong>BOTH MY PARENTS DIE FROM IT</strong>, is weak sauce to the majority and 99.8%+ survivable without 'long-hauler' symptoms.</p>
<p>Which by the way, those long-hauler symptoms? We have had those with flus in the past. Doctors just never freaked out about them and refused to allow their patients to make it appear that those were happening in any great amount in the real world.</p>

        <p>I saw a new paper just the other day demonstrating that levels of cardiac damage from COVID-19 were not abnormal at all.</p>
<p>Regarding "long haulers", what people need to understand is that the typical pathway for disease progression is infection &rt; pneumonia &rt; ARDS &rt; death.  Some people don't get past the first step with more than a couple mild symptoms (if that), while some unfortunately progress to death.  And, yes, the worse the infection gets, the more residual damage it can leave.  </p>
<p>However, that is true of mostly any cold or flu virus.  Any respiratory infection can get bad enough to harm you given the right circumstances.  What we have is an abnormally high number of susceptible population because of limited pre-existing immunity and, frankly, aging societies—a problem we know was creeping up on us.  Sure, that poses some problems.  But, the virus itself is not some totally abnormal thing.  It is just novel.</p>

        <p>Exactly, also I’m sorry to hear about your parents dying. What bothers me is they claim that people are selfish because they don’t want to lock down, when in reality they are the selfish ones because they want everything to be shut down so they can have their illusion of “safety”. Again, it’s unfortunate but people have been and will continue dying from new and old viruses and disease as long as humans are around. It’s ridiculous to suggest we can control these things by destroying more than we’d fix.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry for your loss. I can only wonder how few lives we would have lost if the media and democrats had not outlawed HCQ which is now showing to basically be a cure when used early. It's all so tragic</p>

        <p>The concurrences were great, and then I read Roberts dissent, which basically was the the governor had shifted the boundaries of the "red" zone so the churches and synagogues in the original petition were no longer affected. And maybe the governor might change the boundaries again, but maybe he wouldn't, and if he did, they could repetition the courts and they'd hear it in a day or so, so no need for this ruling. The dissenters apparently do not understand the Constitution at all, and certainly not the First Amendment. </p>
<p>The concurrence was all about the Constitution, and the dissent was about the State, which tells you all you need to know about the dissenting side.</p>

        <p>Gorsuch with some scathing words. I do feel he missed the mark on bicycle shops though. They really are essential, especially in urban areas where people use them for primary transportation, or used to when they could actually go places and do things. All the local bike shops near me have been slammed with work and are having a hard time keeping bikes and parts stocked.</p>
