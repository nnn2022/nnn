    <strong>Today felt like something broke in me. I can't even trust my own family and friends.</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/cdc-director-says-data-suggests-213728435.html">I passed this article around to family and friends.</a></p>
<p>Most of them are doomers and I naively assumed they would treat it as good news... like I did. </p>
<p>Nope. My own mother told me that there was no way we could know that is true and it probably isn't true anyway given the number of variants because the UK strain is now "ravaging" a state that has had falling cases and deaths since Christmas. </p>
<p>Other friends and family made comments about how we can't be too safe, there is no way to know if they can trust that advice, we'll still have to take precautions just to be safe. </p>
<p>And on top of that there was almost a sense of antagonism... like they were angry at me for bringing good news. </p>
<p>I'm honestly broken. If bad news is bad news and good news is ALSO bad news then how can I ever trust people again.</p></p>

        <p>This is one of the harshest realities to bear. Remember that almost not a single one around you can be trusted. Not your family. Not your doctor. Not your waiter at dinner or your mailman. No one.</p>
<p>They are ALL part of the hive. The socially-engineered programming is so thick, so deep, that it penetrates every mind. Every layer. Our society is lost. All we can do is hold our ground and hang on for the ride.</p>
<p>This is basically one of the foremost reasons why I won't associate with anyone. I don't keep friends. I don't go out. I don't want to be around the public. They're zombies. We live in an episode of The Twilight Zone.</p>
<p>When the options are either agenda compliance or loneliness, then the latter is the only reasonable choice unfortunately.</p>

        <p>I trust my family. I’m an intuitive person. I grew up with my parents and siblings and I know they’re good people. They share my beliefs about what’s going on, more or less. My mom is a very slight doomer and wears masks around me sometimes if she comes inside my house but she doesn’t support the mandates or care if anyone else does and is anti-vax in general. That said I’m also fortunate. I can see why OP doesn’t based on his or her experience.</p>
<p>I don’t trust society or people in general though.</p>

        <p>I have two loved ones I can trust. It breaks my heart that my best friend of 15 years has completely bought the line, he’s completely gone. But I take comfort in the fact that I have two TRUE friends that get it and I can talk to.</p>

        <p>You can't. It sucks. Knowing there's people out there like us in this sub is the only thing keeping the my last ounce of hope for humanity inside. This past year has probably broken many of us who are still actively using their own brains.</p>

        <p>The headline of the article seems shit.</p>
<p>"CDC director says data 'suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus'"</p>
<p>One it is encouraging vaccination. And 2 isn't the point of vaccination to inject you with the virus and other shit. I agree with your family best to stay safe and not have an adverse vaccine reaction. What is the point of avoiding breathing in the virus where you have mucus to cough it out vs injecting it (and whatever poison) into your muscles.</p>
<p>I just keep pointing out their condictory beliefs. It's not even hard.</p>
