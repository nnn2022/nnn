        <p>Very true. Trump is not perfect, but under Biden you can absolutely expect unconstitutional nationwide lockdown and mask mandates, crippling national debt, weak foreign policy, and skyrocketing taxes.</p>

        <p>Even if it happened (it won't. If fraud actually stole the election they will never be caught.) it's too far gone. One man, one pretty dim bulb at that, can't stop the ball that's been rolling.</p>
<p>Under Biden things will definitely speed up but no matter what we're fuck. Just be prepared to go off grid, protect yourself at all costs, and know you might literally die fighting for the freedoms being ripped right out from underneath our us.</p>

        <p>I don't have odds on this, just denial with a glimmer of hope.  I don't see the path, but if there is one Trump will find it. He really waited too long to challenge all the new rules, ironically if he had stood up against covid and stopped the narrative and irrational germaphobia, it would have helped keep the original election rules in place.</p>

        <p>Yeah, Trump should not have let his transition team proceed, then they would have brought him to court, and then the court would have had to look at the facts from both sides. <br>
If Biden does get in, I am hoping the virus doomer narrative will be replaced by some new crisis that supports his agenda of higher taxes,  I don't see how the virus narrative will help the left much after they take office, unless, it's just some sadistical thing with the face diapers and lockdowns.</p>

        <p>It's not easy being in his position where it's you against the world. Yeah he may have had his misteps with this whole debacle, but putting all the blame on him without looking at all the madness the left has been doing for the past 10+ years leading to this messy moment isn't fair. Even his party people are f<strong>*</strong>g him up. Was it not a republican who blocked the $2k stimulus bill?</p>

Education entertainment media intelligence you name it so Making a bold move like that would still be difficult given the current circumstances. Nevertheless dude deserves a hand of applause though. It's not easy doing what he's done in the last 4 years given what he faced.</p>

        <p>I think this year was a double edged sword for trump. If he fights the dems govs and health officials they just label him a tyrant. He had to let people and local officials make their own decisions. Now we see places like florida and SD completely recover and we can straight blame dem govs for it.</p>

        <p>I was too.  Then I started to think about what, if anything, he accomplished. </p>
<ul>
<li>If you think back to the early days of Covid, it was Trump who called for the lockdown.  </li>
<li>He was openly critical of  Kemp and Desantis for opening up within 2 months.   </li>
<li>He put through this travesty that is operation warp speed. </li>
<li>Lets also not forget he paraded Fauci and Birx (which has been going on up until a few weeks ago!)  up to the White House podium daily to promote their fear porn</li>
<li>Never fired any of them when he had full understanding of their shenanigans within a month of the pandemic</li>
<li>Never pardoned Snowden or Assange</li>
<li>Kept parts of the JFK assassination classified for "national security reasons"</li>
<li>Seemed to be genuinely concerned for gislaine Maxwell </li>
<li>Personally knew Epstein, his own lawyer Dershowitz flew to the island several times.</li>
</ul>
<p>I honestly think he played us.  There is no way conservatives would have stood for any of this lockdown shit or rushed vaccine crap under Obama.  Trump set the stage.</p>

        <p>I think the issue is what else are they to do when the media has people in a frenzy? Like Boris doesn't WANT to lockdown. But he has no choice because next election that will be it if he doesn't. He's caving to every demand from labour right now so he doesn't look bad. That's the only reason. The people are desperate for a solution and it's easier to give in.</p>

        <p>The first thing he said about "corona" on TV was "nobody panic, the flu kills a lot of people every year"</p>
<p>he never forced anyone to wear masks, or shut down their businesses. the only mistake he made was giving Fauci and others like him a platform to fear monger. there's nothing he can actually do, without becoming a tyrant to counter the tyranny of the governors </p>
<p>Trumps biggest flaw has been the people he surrounded himself with and appointed. He had almost no political experience so he had to learn everything on the fly. Which is why he got betrayed so often, because he gave people the benefit of the doubt and was too trusting.</p>

        <p>I don't think the establishment planned on Trump, hence the Hillary campaign propping him up during the GOP primaries as an "easy target to beat". They miscalculated, hence the mad rush to sloppily rig 2020. I think he was allowed to remain in order to pacify our lot while they accelerated their plans. From the state of things, they were successful. A populist will never get into the White House again. It won't be allowed, and our ability to fight them on their bullshit has been massively eroded and continues to be so. In a very real way, Trump has been an asset to them.</p>

        <p>He certainly didn’t do a great job uniting the country. I actually think the pandemic was a missed opportunity for him.  </p>
<p>Anyways it was still a ridiculously close election. It’s kind of cool to think that a non-politician could get elected to the highest office in the land. It definitely sent a message to those in power, although the way it ended leaves a sour taste in my mouth.</p>

        <p>It was a landslide for Trump.  Overall, at the time of writing Biden has won 477 counties, Trump has won 2,497 counties with 110 still outstanding.

The problem was the cheating in the major cities of PA, MI,WI, GA and AZ and others was enough to overturn the rest.</p>

        <p>This is just off the cuff and I’m no political expert, but I think if there was a conspiracy here, it was to encourage people from California and New York to move to neighboring states, essentially rigging the numbers. </p>

        <p>I am guessing that was accidental. I think the government has starved out the rural areas as much as possible, (I'm living in one). They want people crammed into tenements, with the higher earners paying an extra grand a month for fancy countertops.   They don't want suburbs or rural.</p>

        <p>Might be hard for many to believe this. But Trump is here to usher in the New World Order hand in hand with Biden. If you do not believe that the powers that be cannot control both sides of the political spectrum, than you may as well not believe that we are seeing the biggest pharmaceutical fraud in history to usher in a communist authoritarian global government with all of the beautiful and pleasant things it will shower upon humanity.</p>
<p><strong>“Presidents are selected, not elected.”</strong> 
― Franklin D. Roosevelt</p>
<p>FDR knew this, but how many of you understand this?</p>
<p>It's okay for a president to come out and tell you the game is rigged, but if someone like myself tried to tell you.... "oh, you're a conspiracy nut".... "my vote still matters".</p>
<p>All your vote did was make you morally culpable for the atrocities being carried out in your name.</p>
<p>The president is nothing but a puppet on the throne for those who are really in power. Do you think maybe FDR knew a thing or two about this?</p>
<p>Even a brief view into history reveals the parasitic manner in which the ruling class has infiltrated the US government to ensure that their status quo will remain. Their NWO plan will continue to unfold regardless of who the president is.</p>
<p>The lie is in thinking it makes a difference whether it was Biden or Trump.</p>
<p>The following quotes are all from presidents, vice presidents, and the great historian Carroll Quigley who were telling us about this hidden hand. It's not like this information is hidden. It's right out in the open. They think that the American people are so dumbed down and brainwashed that they won't figure it out. Again, even a brief study of politics and banking in the American 19th and 20th century alone would reveal how this works.</p>
<p>“A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is privately concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men… [W]e have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated, governments in the civilized world—no longer a government by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men.” – Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States, The New Freedom, 1913</p>
<p>“The real truth of the matter is, as you and I know, that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.” — Franklin Delano Roosevelt, 32nd President of the United States (1933–1945), in a letter to Colonel Edward M House dated November 21, 1933, as quoted in F.D.R.: His Personal Letters, 1928-1945.</p>
<p>“Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men’s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.” – Woodrow Wilson, 28th President of the United States, The New Freedom, 1913</p>
<p>“The individual is handicapped by coming face-to-face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists. The American mind simply has not come to a realization of the evil which has been introduced into our midst. It rejects even the assumption that human creatures could espouse a philosophy which must ultimately destroy all that is good and decent.” —J. Edgar Hoover, The Elks Magazine, 1956</p>
<p>“A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many and various powerful interests, combined in one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in banks.” – John C. Calhoun, Vice President (1825-1832) and U.S. Senator, from a speech given on May 27, 1836</p>

        <p>Sure about that? Why was Trump very close friends with two different men to run two massive pedophile rings? Ever hear of Trump’s protege Roy Cohn? This man ran a child prostitution network side by side with a man named Craig Spence. They ran a network of child prostitutes for the CIA/Mossad that went all the way to the Reagan/Bush Sr. White House. Sadly enough, this very same pedophile ring was a part of a much larger network that connected directly to the infamous Franklin sex abuse scandal. Isn’t it strange how this connects to two former presidents as well? Almost like it reinforces what I’ve stated above about all presidents being puppets under blackmail. Trump is no exception. To think otherwise is to have fallen for the powers that be’s massive illusion that Trump is somehow the “good guy”. He’s not.

        <p>He is 100% complicit and in the know as to what the elites are doing, or he was manipulated by them but was dumb enough to play right into their hands.</p>
<p>Either way, he hasn't done enough to help us get out of this mess, and much of the blame falls on him just as much as the rest of the corrupt politicians and the ignorant masses.</p>

        <p>He's a bad leader. Simple as that. The next guy will be worse, and who ever comes after that will be even worse. But at the end of the day, he still failed to lead. Point the finger at whoever you want, but the fact remains that the country is in the worst place it has been in my lifetime.</p>
