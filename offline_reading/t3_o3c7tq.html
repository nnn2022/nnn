        <p>I never used to be antivax. I watched the scandemic play out and knew the mRNA treatment was bullshit, but at first I still considered myself “not antivax, just anti-experimental gene therapy.” But the more time goes on, the more I start to wonder if there’s merit in the side effects classic antivaxxers claim. The medical industry can not be trusted, that’s clear</p>

        <p>Funny thing about Oxford, according to historian Carroll Quigley, was that it’s home to the powerful secret society Quigley dubbed “The Group”.</p>
<p><strong>”This organization has been able to conceal its existence quite successfully, and many of its most influential members, satisfied to possess the reality rather than the appearance of power, are unknown even to close students of British history.</strong> This is the more surprising when we learn that one of the chief methods by which this Group works has been <strong>through propaganda.</strong> It plotted the Jameson Raid of 1895; it <strong>caused the Boer War of 1899-1902; it set up and controls the Rhodes Trust; it created the Union of South Africa in 1906-1910;</strong> it established the South African periodical The State in 1908; it founded the British Empire periodical The Round Table in 1910, and this remains the mouthpiece of the Group; <strong>it has been the most powerful single influence in All Souls, Balliol, and New Colleges at Oxford for more than a generation;</strong> it has <strong>controlled The Times for more than fifty years</strong>, with the exception of the three years 1919-1922, it publicized the idea of and the name "British Commonwealth of Nations" in the period 1908-1918, it was the chief influence in Lloyd George's war administration in 1917-1919 and dominated the British delegation to the Peace Conference of 1919; it had a great deal to do with the formation and management of the League of Nations and of the system of mandates; it founded the Royal Institute of International Affairs in 1919 and still controls it; it was one of the chief influences on British policy toward Ireland, Palestine, and India in the period 1917-1945; it was a very important influence on the policy of appeasement of Germany during the years 1920-1940; and it controlled and still controls, to a very considerable extent, the sources and the writing of the history of British Imperial and foreign policy since the Boer War.</p>
<p>It would be expected that a Group which could number among its achievements such accomplishments as these would be a familiar subject for discussion among students of history and public affairs. In this case, the expectation is not realized, partly because of the <strong>deliberate policy of secrecy</strong> which this Group has adopted, partly because <strong>the Group itself is not closely integrated but rather appears as a series of overlapping circles or rings partly concealed by being hidden behind formally organized groups of no obvious political significance.”</strong></p>
<p>“Although the membership of the Milner Group has slowly shifted with the passing years, the Group still reflects the characteristics of its chief leader and, through him, the ideological orientation of Balliol in the 1870s. Although <strong>the Group did not actually come into existence until 1891, its history covers a much longer period, since its origins go back to about 1873.</strong> This history can be <strong>divided into four periods</strong>, of which the first, from 1873 to 1891, could be called the preparatory period and centers about the figures of W. T. Stead and Alfred Milner. The second period, from 1891 to 1901, could be called the Rhodes period, although Stead was the chief figure for most of it. The third period, from 1901 to 1922, could be called the New College period and centers about Alfred Milner. <strong>The fourth period, from about 1922 to the present, could be called the All Souls period and centers about Lord Lothian, Lord Brand, and Lionel Curtis.</strong> During these four periods, the Group grew steadily in power and influence, until about 1939. It was badly split on the policy of appeasement after 16 March 1939, and received a rude jolt from the General Election of 1945. Until 1939, however, <strong>the expansion in power of the Group was fairly consistent. This growth was based on the possession by its members of ability, social connections, and wealth. It is not possible to distinguish the relationship of these three qualities—a not uncommon situation in England.”</strong></p>

        <p>There's this weird mentality that I've been noticing where it's like, "just act. It doesn't matter if you are improving on the situation or lowering risk. Just act"..</p>
<p>An example is stores making changes for the sake of change alone, even if it doesn't cut risk. Plexiglass (which is now starting to be debunked), shutting down 50% of entrances, and shortened hours doesn't have scientific research. They just want to put highly visible changes into affect to "show respect for the cause". It's quite pathetic. It's theatre.</p>
