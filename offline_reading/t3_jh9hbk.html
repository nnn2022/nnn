        <p>You may be twice my age but it doesnt mean youre smarter than me.  I hope that you will look back in the future and realise how much pain you people have actually caused. So many people are at home unable to leave and youre out and about not helping your community. Again, you have no point and are only using cheap insults to ‘roast me’. You’re a true genius, little buddy!</p>

        <p>Right, a teenager is smarter than me. Instead of blaming us, why not blame your kind? Why is it that cases (a useless metric) are going up, even in states with near 100% mask compliance? And before you say anything, 100% compliance is impossible.</p>

And you are also saying that the deaths dont mean anything because they are just y’know a useless metric. when will you learn that it isnt about the numbers. IT IS ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DYING.

        <p>The facts? Roughly 60 million people die every year, another 1 million isn't much, especially when most would've died within 5 years anyway. Most deaths and complications are in the elderly, obese, and immunocompromised. Old age can't be helped, but the obese can lose weight and the immunocompromised should've been taking precautions since long before COVID. Humans evolved to live in packs between a few dozen and a few hundred close social contacts, and we physically cannot give a fuck about millions of total strangers; those who say otherwise often have poor relationships with their family and friends because their compassion has grown shallow and hollow. If you believe authoritarian collectivism is a viable long-term strategy, you are the delusional little child who apparently has zero understanding of population dynamics or evolutionary psychology.</p>

        <p>Did you stay home and wear a mask in previous winters to prevent the tens of thousands of flu deaths that happen every flu season?  I'm guessing not.  So are those lives less important that the lives taken from covid?</p>

        <p>I see your point but don’t you realize that covid19 is a new virus? We have no vaccine or real medicine for it, we still don’t know much about it and its killed a hell of a lot more people then the flu does each year. By the way anti maskers are acting this virus will not be gone for the next couple of years. It really isnt much to ask for you to wear a mask. Keep an open mind. You probably made up your mind about masks at the very beginning of this pandemic, and all i am saying is to reconsider the facts</p>

        <p>For fuck's sake, COVID isn't that new if a virus. It's a new strain of the common cold virus that we have a little less resistance to, just like how we get a new strain of the flu virus every few years that hits us a little harder, NOT some superbug we know absolutely nothing about. We do have treatments and we don't need a vaccine; even the flu vaccine is only roughly 50/50 effective, and every coronavirus vaccine to date has been ineffective to downright dangerous. This virus will NEVER be gone no matter what we do, it'll become seasonal like every other cold and flu virus. Masks and lockdowns are only delaying the inevitable. YOU should keep an open mind, people like you are the ones who limit themselves to what a select few officials spoonfeed you.</p>

        <p>Typing in ALL CAPS really detracts from whatever point you're trying to make. Yes, this NEW STRAIN of a KNOWN VIRUS was discovered in 2019, and the death rate of COVID-19 is closer to a bad cold/flu season than the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic. COVID-19 spreads much more readily, and as a virus spreads, it grows less dangerous because it needs its hosts alive and well. Nevermind how many minor infections are unreported, how many deaths are those who would've died within a few years anyway, and how many are dying WITH the virus but not actually FROM it. Since when did teenagers become so closed-minded and easily manipulated?</p>

        <p>Well, let’s look at how you started that thread - aggressively and insultingly. </p>
<p>&rt; I just wanna say that i find it funny that no one has a genuinely good point. It just shows how close Minded and unwilling these people are to change their minds. Crazy stuff</p>
<p>This tone is <em>always</em> actively discouraging of civil discussion. The fact that you then had a somewhat substantive discussion is a credit to u/trishpike and their commitment to civil discourse. Let’s look at that conversation: the other user didn’t insult you even ONCE (and that opinion that you said you think is in the wrong sub? That is the <em>majority</em> opinion here, btw). </p>
<p>You dodged most questions in favor of repeatedly asserting conclusions without evidence, and throwing in insults and accusations. That is NOT a reasoned discussion - it is just saying the same thing over and over and over as though repetition makes it true. </p>
<p>If you’d like to have a <em>reasoned, evidence based</em> discussion about anything, I’d be very happy to do so (provided you can keep the insults to a minimum ;).</p>

        <p>&rt; I said that I cared enough To appreciate that others wanted to be safe and not die. </p>
<p>Clear implication: you do NOT care enough to appreciate that others want to be safe and not die. </p>
<p>This is a baseless accusation of bad moral character - aka an insult. </p>
<p>&rt; but if you have sense you just get on with it, wearing a mask isnt hard either.</p>
<p>Clear implication: you do NOT have sense. </p>
<p>Again, that’s an insult. </p>
<p>&rt; I guess I mistaked your talking confidently with knowing your facts. </p>
<p>This is aggressively insulting, particularly when made by someone who provides no specifics or substantiated facts. </p>
<p>&rt; I just Think bitching about a mask is the most  first world problem you can have. </p>
<p>This assumes that there are no valid reasons for objecting to mask <em>mandates</em> and assumes a lack of evidence/reasoning (clear implication: stupidity). </p>
<p>&rt; Just follow the rules, I know you hate that word but it just seems like you’re trying to not be like others when you say that.</p>
<p>This is similarly insulting in its assumption of the other person’s character and motives. </p>
<p>&rt; I will say it again, all you really need to be wearing a mask for is probably around 20 to 30 minutes right? </p>
<p>This is insulting in that it <strong>blatantly</strong> ignores what the other user wrote. The explicitly stated that they DO wear masks as mandated (as do most people here, btw).</p>
<p>&rt; Since you are 20 years older then me you should be more responsible then me, even maybe more caring? </p>
<p>This is an explicit insult: you are irresponsible and uncaring. </p>
<p>This insult is odd in light of their explicit statement that they DO wear masks as required. It seems you are not happy with compliance, but additionally desire <em>enthusiastic</em> compliance? </p>
<p>&rt; Yet you simply cannot wear one while you work out or go to the store. </p>
<p>Based on what?? The fact that they EXPLICITLY SAID THEY WEAR MASKS FOR THESE ACTIVITIES? </p>
<p>&rt; Next time you go to the store think about how you could be potentially saving someomes life when you wear that mask.  </p>
<p>Why? Why should they do that? The person told you that they wear masks. Do masks only work if you think the right thoughts while wearing them? </p>
<p>It is always insulting to ignore what someone says in favor of what you <em>imagine</em> they have said. It communicates that you have no respect or regard for them as an individual. </p>
<p>&rt; you should just reconsider your ideas on wearing a Mask</p>
<p><strong>What exactly should this person, who wears masks as required, reconsider about wearing masks?</strong></p>

        <p>point 1: that is nothing but fact. I care and he simply does not care enough</p>
<p>point 2: ‘if you have sense you will just get on with it’ Is very clearly not an insult. I doubt anyone in the world would get offended by that.</p>
<p>point 3: I pointed out that he does not know his facts. I mistaked in the previous conversation with him that he knew his facts. How do you think this is insulting? He did not know his facts which we then discussed.</p>
<p>Point 4: i agree this is an insult but it is not baseless, it has a point to it and it is simply true. It also is not personal</p>
<p>point 5: he had previously stated that he hates the word rules. I told him to follow the rules even though he hates that word. You know very well  that hating the word rules just means you want to be different.</p>
<p>Point 6: I do not see how this is an insult, i just don’t because he literally said that. How is it? Please explain Further.</p>
<p>Point 7: i think he is uncaring and i also think he is a little irresponsible, could be taken as insulting but was not meant that way.</p>
<p>Point 8: when i said this i should have clarified that i meant do not want to and that if the rules werent there he would gladly go around without one</p>
<p>Point 9: why not do it? Why? You couldnt give me a single reason because its true. He is unenthusiastic about wearing a mask and doesnt want to and probably doesn’t correctly (since he does not like masks). In no way, no way at all is that insulting. The only person to interpret that as insulting is you. Me and him were having a civilised debate and there really was no insults thrown. Both of us I’m sure came out with different perspectives of the other.</p>
<p>Point 9: in no way was that insulting, its a conversation.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your response, thank you. I’m very happy to address all of these points, but to avoid a messy conversation where things get lost, I’ll stick to one at a time. The first one is a good place to start. </p>
<p>&rt; I care and he simply does not care enough. </p>
<p>Everyone cares very much ... but about <em>what</em>? Many of the people opposed to lockdowns (which is the universal issue for most in these subs; there is considerable disagreement over mask/mandates) oppose lockdowns specifically because they <em>do</em> care about a lot of things. For example: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the 10+ million people who are going to die of starvation due to lockdowns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the 30k excess Alzheimers deaths in the US alone so far this year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the huge jump in stillbirths around the world due to lack of prenatal care during lockdowns? Or about the increase in suicides, particularly amongst children?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the increased rates of forced child marriage and female genital mutilation directly caused by lockdowns (reversing a trend of improving) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the nursing home residents who are literally begging to be freed from isolation, which is a form of torture </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the missed chemo, missed cancer diagnoses, and untreated heart attacks and strokes due to lockdowns </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the rise in domestic violence (both in frequency and severity)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m fully aware of the cost of covid (using current IFR estimates), but are you fully aware of these costs of lockdowns? You made a comment about valuing the economy over lives, but that is not the case - valuing the economy IS valuing lives. </p>
<p>Whenever you have a problem to solve, you have to consider the costs of the solution compared to the problem to determine whether the solution actually provides a net benefit. </p>
<p>For example, let’s say the problem is a mildly infected cut on a finger. We could solve it by amputating the arm, but the costs of that solution make it worse than the problem itself. </p>
<p>Just because a solution is extremely costly - like amputating an arm - doesn’t mean the solution isn’t right, of course. For instance, if you have severe gangrene or whatever that cannot be treated and will spread to the rest of your body, amputation, though very costly, is still warranted. </p>
<p>But you <em>always</em> need to consider the costs of a solution in order to make a well-reasoned decision. Most people here initially formed their views because they were specifically looking at (and caring about!) all of the tremendous costs of lockdowns: based on the relative costs of covid and of lockdowns, they concluded that the lockdowns are wrong and harmful. </p>
<p>You may disagree with that position, but you cannot fairly or accurately accuse people who hold it of not caring. </p>
<p>I imagine you’re thinking, “well if you don’t want to lockdown, then wear masks!”</p>
<p>To this, I’ll point out again that most people here do wear their masks. </p>
<p>However (and this is getting into a very different discussion), the “just wear masks” position is 100% dependent on the assumption that <em>masks have a meaningful impact on reducing transmission.</em> </p>
<p>I know, you are positively certain that there is no question about it - but ... how have you formed that conclusion? </p>
<p>I formed my conclusion after spending significant time researching the available evidence - going over a ridiculous number of systematic reviews and nearly ALL RCTs on mask effectiveness from the last hundred years. This also includes the available data concluding that masks are effective - scientific conclusions are based on the <em>totality</em> of the evidence, which means considering everything, not picking and choosing what you like. </p>
<p>My conclusion - shared by a significant number of scientists - is that there is no evidence that masks have a meaningful impact on reducing transmission. I oppose mask mandates on <em>that</em> basis, <strong>not because I don’t care about not infecting people.</strong></p>
<p>If the <em>totality of the evidence</em> supported a conclusion that masks do have a meaningful impact on reducing transmission, then I’d absolutely change my stance on masks and wear them even without mandates because I <em>do</em> care about other people. However, I am not going to disregard evidence for the mere <em>appearance</em> of doing something about covid. </p>
<p><strong>My point is not to get into a debate about masks or lockdowns</strong> - it is to point out that I, the person you were chatting with, and most other people here, in fact care very much and it is factually incorrect (and extremely insulting) to claim otherwise.</p>

        <p>I understand your point plenty but in my opinion the only way to get out of lockdown is to get through lockdown rather than avoid lockdown, if you understand me? Also I know it can be confusing but masks do not work if you are the only person in a room with the mask on. If a room is filled with 3 people and all 3 have a mask on and 1 has covid, the odds are that the other 2 will be fine. i was in close contact with someone with covid for over a half an hour but we both had masks on and i am fine. The facts you researched were probably talking About if you have a mask On and the other person who has covid does not, what are the odd that you will get covid. This is really difficult to phrase and just put in a sentence but i hope you understand what i mean. So the evidence is there that masks do work. I still think that most people here really aren’t Thinking about others and are making excuses just to make themselves feel better about the fact that they don’t want to be in this lockdown (no one wants it, but it’s necessary).</p>

        <p>I didn’t say that they are the same. </p>
<p>I said that the argument “if lots of people agree on X, then you should accept that X is right on that basis” is a weak argument. It is logically fallacious.</p>

        <p>I think you’re scared (unreasonably so, and I’ll tell you why briefly in case you’re not trolling) and want somebody to blame.</p>
<p>So the point of “No New Normal” isn’t necessarily “Fuck everyone! Let’s spit on the old people and give them all COVID! Haha!” while twirling their old timey moustache. It’s that we’re not accepting everything that’s been happening in the last 9 months as normal - we don’t want to wear masks forever, we want children to be able to go to school, we don’t like fear porn that the media is jamming down our throats.</p>
<p>I don’t know anybody personally who died of COVID. I live in NY, and I know people who most likely had it (like myself), definitely had it (proven by antibodies), and only a small handful of people who’ve actually had a positive test. I feel living / working in the epicenter of the virus in March / April surely I would’ve seen more people affected? We all just truly thought it was a bad flu.</p>
<p>I’d also like to add another approximately 10,000 seniors in NY died in nursing homes because any seniors who went to the hospitals and tested positive but weren’t so sick they needed a ventilator were sent back to their nursing home while still contagious. The hospitals were trying to empty out their beds to prepare for the hospital overload that never came (surge yes, overload no). So predictably these seniors spread COVID to the aides and the rest of the other seniors in the nursing homes. That’s 1/3 of the # of deaths in NY that could’ve been prevented by sending them to a COVID ward until they were no longer contagious. Makes the numbers a lot less scary when you realize that.</p>
<p>My question to you - have you looked up your personal risk factor? Based on your age, gender, weight and other known pre-existing conditions? I did back in April, and it was and continues to be something like 0.01%. I literally have a greater chance of dying in a car crash - which, I actually <em>do</em> know more people this year who’ve died in a car crash than of COVID. The media’s made it seem like we’re all going to die - we’re not.</p>
<p>With regards to your friend’s grandma, how old was she, did she have any other co-morbidities, and what would’ve been her life expectancy if she hadn’t gotten COVID? The very frail and the very old are at risk - this is true - but their chances of surviving are still 95%.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this - are you scared because you thought through all of this and have a reason to be scared? Or are you scared because the media tells you to be? Remember nothing gets more clicks than death.</p>
<p>We’ve also gotten much better at treating this virus since the beginning.</p>
<p>Virus aside, we’re all very aware of all of the secondary effects of the lockdowns and general loss of society in the last 9 months. While you might think we’re blasé about the threats of the virus, I think you’re being incredibly blasé to the very real and harmful effects the lockdowns have been on children, their lack of schooling and socialization, and the loss of what will likely be over a year of their lives. Have you looked a 17 year old in the face and said, “No senior year for you - no prom, no sports, no graduation, no friends, just learning via Zoom,” when you know their risk from this virus is almost zero? How is that fair to them?</p>
<p>Not to mention the decimation of small businesses, and 1/4 mile long lines at the food banks, families losing their houses because of the economy crashing. What about them?</p>
<p>Everything has a cost in this world. Everything. And we’ve decided the cost of lockdowns is far too great a cost we’re willing to pay</p>

        <p>I never said I was scared of covid19, I said that I cared enough To appreciate that others wanted to be safe and not die. I know  people with really bad asthma that literally have not been able to go outside. There is people at risk that are getting depressed but can’t go outside because they could get it and their life would just about be over. I know the economy will be absolutely terrible after this but you cant really put money over peoples lives. I really understand you want things to be normal, we all do... but if we want to get to that again we have to follow the rules. its the anti maskers that are denying that. It is not us. I think you are in the wrong subreddit to be honest because your opinion is a lot lot less radical than a lot of the people on here. I was called so much shit. Somebody said a mask was a diaper. You seem to know the facts at the very least but your opinion is just different to mine. By the way I am a teenager so I know the struggle of not being able to see my friends And doing zoom. It really doesnt feel fair but if you have sense you just get on with it, wearing a mask isnt hard either.</p>

        <p>Okay. So you’re about 20 years younger than me. You seen actually open to having a conversation - if anything, you have too much faith in the goodwill of the internet! - and you’re understandably upset about why your life has been completely upended.</p>
<p>First all, I’m in a bunch of different antilockdown subs on Reddit, which all seem to span a number of different positions and political affiliations - both because the enemy of my enemy is my friend, and because it’s important to listen to different opinions. Especially moreso that everyone is mostly still locked inside - the groupthink is stronger than ever, echo chambers have <em>never</em> done anyone any good, and there just isn’t much nuance in talking and debating online. Almost all of my friends espouse very pro-lockdown, pro-mask views on FB and that’s just very skewed.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how much research you’ve done on this pandemic specifically, but since my life has come to a screeching halt the last 7 months, I’ve been reading up on this <em>a lot</em> with my copious free time.</p>
<p>So the first part is that the reaction to this pandemic is completely overblown. Look, I fell for it too. It’s not nearly as deadly as believed. The reason everyone locked down is because China locked down, then Italy panicked and locked down, and then almost the rest of the world panicked and copied THEM. There actually was both a WHO and CDC pandemic playbook, and except for Sweden the entire world ignored it.</p>
<p>The virus is dangerous for the elderly and the frail. Unless you’re morbidly obese, you’re going to be fine, your friends are going to be fine, your husband (if I read that correctly) is going to be just fine. For us the flu is actually more dangerous. Even for your friends with asthma they’ll be fine. If they’re really that nervous, almost every store has curbside pickup, a lot of jobs can be done remotely, but again, are all of those precautions really necessary when they’re still more likely to die in a car crash?</p>
<p>With regards to the phrase “the rules” (which I’m starting to hate), I want to differentiate between actual laws passed by a vote, executive orders passed by mayors / governors (many of which are unconstitutional) and recommendations from the CDC, Fauci and other various health experts. The mask mandates fall under this category. So there’s actually no proof they work, or really do much of anything. You hear about these mask mandates and anti-mask leagues during the Spanish Flu? They figured it was something to try - a worthy goal - and people have actually done studies in the last 100 years to see if they actually help. Every study prior to March 2020 is inconclusive. That’s also partly why they were saying not to buy masks in Feb / March. They weren’t going to do that much for the general public and there was a huge shortage of them, and the doctors and nurses needed them to protect them from patients coughing in their face.</p>
<p>They switched the guidance in April because - why not? What was there to lose? Also people were really scared back then. If masks and plexiglass helped convince grocery store workers they weren’t going to die going to work then let’s try it!</p>
<p>The issue with the mask mandates is that they’ve done nothing in the real world. Literally every location with mask mandates has had case counts continue to rise. Both at the time they’re implemented and then again many months later. If they worked, shouldn’t there be at least <em>one</em> location where it’s worked? Now social distancing <em>does</em> work, but it’s like burning down your house to kill a spider. It was only ever supposed to be a 30 day measure, not 7+ months. That’s why cases rise and fall as things close and then open back up.</p>
<p>But mask mandates do give an amazing scapegoat! I don’t know where you live, but in NY it’s nearly 100% compliance. I think they’re stupid but if a store requires me to wear one when I go inside I do it. Yet all we hear is that “not enough masks! Anti-maskers are the reason cases are continuing to rise!” When my eyes tell me that just can’t be possible. It’s a great cudgel though to turn neighbor against neighbor - as opposed to the government admitting there’s really not that much they can do to “stop the spread”.</p>
<p>People online are getting sick of it, and that’s why so many responses are nasty. That’s what it’s doing, it’s causing division amongst people. If they really worked you wouldn’t need a mandate - 95% of people would comply without asking. It’s also completely opposite to public health policy - you’re supposed to educate and cajole people, not wack them over the head with a hammer. If you force people to do something than a not small percentage will refuse on principle.</p>
<p>This was a tremendous public health failure. It’s almost like they deliberately did everything wrong. Just massive, massive failure on all levels.</p>

        <p>I guess I mistaked your talking confidently with knowing your facts. masks do totally 100% work. And it really sucks if you are not willing to wear one. Did you know? wearing a mask does not protect you, it protects others <strong>and</strong> if that other is wearing a mask it protects you too! It makes life easier. you said ‘people online are getting sick of it’, we are all sick of it but we are all still able to get through it. You also said that there really is not much the government can do to stop the spread. Okay. So why is it that New Zealand has only had some cases and some deaths and currently has 0 cases yet America has oh so many? It is because they locked down the airports when they could, they closed the schools, they did everything they could to stop it And now they are living their lives happy as Larry. No small businesses are going under, no deaths, no economic crash. its all because of people following the rules. We could be there now but no we aren’t because people can’t listen to the government. I just Think bitching about a mask is the <em>most</em>  first world problem you can have. I got the idea you are working from home yeah? So entering a store or seeing your family is really the only actual time you need to wear a mask. Just follow the rules, I know you hate that word but it just seems like you’re trying to not be like others when you say that.</p>

        <p>Well, again, being as I live in NY I am mandated to wear a mask when I go shopping, which I do, but I hate it. I have to wear it at the gym which is insanity, so all the cardio classes have moved outside as much as possible. That’s cool in Sept but what’s going to happen in November when the temperature here drops? I would completely go back to life tomorrow, unmasked, packed subway cars and all.</p>
<p>Also to your premise that they protect 100% - that’s a very dangerous thought because it’s untrue. Ask any public health official and they’ll tell you the same thing. They don’t protect me, and I don’t see any signs that they protect you from me breathing on you. That’s also assuming that I even have the virus which incredibly unlikely being as all signs point to have having had it already in January (from working in NYC). Also from the negative test I had last week.</p>
<p>I know I don’t agree with people on this sub 100% - but there’s <em>plenty</em> of nastiness on the other side as well. You’re never going to agree with everyone, but the people making these stupid rules are completely out of control.</p>
<p>With regards to NZ - their small businesses did crash. Hard. No tourism in the country is allowed (unless you’re rich enough to fly there, quarantine for 2 weeks, and THEN start traveling). It’s also an island country so it’s a lot easier to keep people out. Besides the fact that it’s impossible to do that in the US, it was also documented to have been here since December and January.</p>

        <p>I will say it again, all you really <strong>need</strong> to be wearing a mask for is probably around 20 to 30 minutes right? I know the gym can be a while but you don’t have to do that. Since you are 20 years older then me you should be more responsible then me, even maybe more caring? But it Doesnt seem that way to me. I wear my mask for 8 hours getting the bus and going to school and getting the bus back. Which is just my normal routine Except i wear a little bit of cloth on My face. Yet you simply cannot wear one while you work out or go to the store. How about this? Next time you go to the store think about how you could be potentially saving someomes life when you wear that mask.  I know that you aren’t a bad person as well cause you seem like a cool guy but you should just reconsider your ideas on wearing a Mask</p>
