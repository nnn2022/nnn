    <strong>What is the excuse now? (Covid Vaccine)</strong>
    <p><p>In the last days, we all have seen a lot of news about Coronavirus Vaccines and their supposedly high effectiveness.</p>
<p>I have read also a lot of news stating that <strong>"it would be mandatory"</strong> for everyone. So, my question here is: Why?</p>
<p>I mean, with the forced quarantine and lockdowns around the globe, when I say that it would be my decision if I want to go out or not, or if I want to use a damned face mask or not, the typical answer I get is: <em>"you can do whatever you want with your life, but if you go out or don't use mask, you will infect other people"</em>. I'm not fully agreed with this because nobody forces you to go out. If you want to stay home, you can do it, but alright! Let's say I understand the argument. But what is the excuse now? What will they say?</p>
<p>I am not a conspiracyist or anti-vaccine but I simply don't want it. Simple and plain. Easy to understand. I don't want it. What will they say? This is all about me. If you have the vaccine, I won't infect you. My life. My decision. My health. What is the problem? Am I missing something?</p></p>

        <p>You're not missing anything my friend, I would love to say that it's a conspiracy theory and chalk it up to that but the vaccines are going to be used for sterilization... that's how these bastards are going to fulfill the depopulation fetish they have, amongst the long-term health effects from these vaccines</p>

        <p>Several reasons to be quite honest with you, from my own research on the ingredients in the vaccine but also from what good ol' Gates out of hell has told us his dream of vaccines are for, sinister as fuck stuff</p>

        <p>You do make a good point and I do agree but not going into conspiracies but the Georgia Guidestones want humanity to be under 500 million. Also, Gates himself has said that if he does things right with the vaccines he can reduce the population by up to 15% and that we are 'useless eaters'</p>

        <p>they can cry my body my choice about abortion but you can’t use the same reason for a pointless vaccine. It only applies to reason if it goes with their agenda. I agree I flat out don’t want one either. I don’t social distance much or wear a mask when I don’t have to by law (I live in Illinois where it’s mandatory to wear one in any store) I’ve went this whole time without getting it. On top of that I’m a building engineer at a hotel and I go in and out of rooms all day at work that are occupied by guests. I don’t immediately wash my hands, which I use all day working with tools and touching stuff in rooms that guests have touched, and I haven’t gotten sick yet. So why would I intentionally inject it into by body and possibly feel some symptoms when I never got it in the first place. If I were to catch Covid I would quarantine for 2 weeks just to be somewhat responsible, but that’s only if I actually caught the virus. I don’t want the vaccine so why should I have to get it?</p>

        <p>&rt;So, my question here is: Why?</p>
<p>Because it doesn't work that's why. When something works it works for the user. In the case of the vaccine it must protect the recipient. But since it's mandated it means it doesn't Because nobody cares about me, whether I live or die.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<em>if you go out or don't use mask, you will infect other people</em></p>
<p>Yea ok if they don't trust you, ask them to prove it. Because with their logic, if they go out with their 2 hands they have the potential to kill somebody.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Am I missing something? </p>
<p>Yes they want to push drugs and they always did that, that's the missing part.</p>

<p>Bill Gates has a vaxx certification identity scam  that is tattooed onto the person. He wants this crypto QR code inked on every human on the planet so he can kick off his human block chain. </p>
<p>This vaxx certification mark will be required to buy/travel/move about. Hence fulfilling the 666 prophecy</p>
