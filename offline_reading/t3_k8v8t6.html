    <strong>Is this how the narrative is going to be framed?</strong>
    <p><p>"We are delighted to do our duty and protect lives".  </p>
<p>Clearly the incoming narrative is going to be "Do Your Duty - Protect Lives". It's a bit of a longer slogan than the usual three word slogans that the Tory party tend to come up with but, I'm pretty certain that is the narrative that is on the horizon. It sort of reminds me of the "Your country needs you" style propaganda of the second world war. The way conscientious objectors were portrayed back then will be how vaccine concerned or vaccine cautious are portrayed now too.  </p>
<p>All these politicians lining up to say "I'll take the vaccine publicly" remind me of the hamburger eating minister (whose name escapes me right now) who consumed the burger on live tv to let us all know how safe beef was during the BSE "mad cow" disease episode. Then we discovered the link between eating BSE infected cattle and NvCJD.  </p>
<p>I'm dismayed to say that folk I know myself that I had down as critical thinkers are literally lining up to "Do their duty" too. It's strange what fear does to people really. There is way too much compliance right now and I am not entirely sure there will be enough resistance to these measures to make our government think twice about the folly it is currently engaging in. It will make the more resistant folk easier to single out and target too.   </p>
<p>We are truly in Orwell territory now.   </p>

        <p>They won’t be taking the vaccine it’ll be saline to calm people down. Fauci was right when he said the UK rushed this too bad he doubled down like the coward he is.</p>

        <p>I didn't think for one minute that they would but, if they do, it may well be another BSE moment when they realise a few months/years down the line that serious complications have arisen as a result of the vaccine. The people of the UK are basically rab lats right now.</p>

        <p>I think so, I'm going to keep an eye out for that phrase because if it hasn't been given to them from the government already, some civil service goon will have seen it on a copy of the Metro left in a train seat and jotted it down.</p>
