        <p>Right?! People often lash out rather violently when their worldview comes into question. It’s painful to witness, especially close friends succumb to the programming. The search for truth is often a very lonely journey. 😒</p>

        <p>It's the vaccines that put the virus under pressure to create variants. I hope it's 3 years but if those alarmed at the risk of ADE are correct, I'm guessing around March next year we'll be standing in the aftermath, staring around and almost numb as they demand Internet passports due to the cyber-plandemic</p>

        <p>There's hope if you live close to any of the places banning vaccine requirements and passports. Lower governments are taking matters into their own hands and hopefully that phenomenon spreads. It sounds terrible but I'm glad that the people who get all their information from the person on the tv are in the test group and I'm in the control group.</p>

<p>But as the evidence builds it's all bullshit, that the vacs are proving dangerous, that safe drugs already exist, that masks and lockdowns are pretty damn useless...? No change. They quit smiling but keep repeating the same thing, hoping for a different result.</p>

        <p>No, Covid does that and a lot more, that's what you're risking, no more hard-ons, no more babies, no more New Years, no more years at all.   If you get the Delta variant, you're in deep shit, it's killing people, people who are unvaccinated.  That's ALL the occupants of hospitals are republicans who listen to that bullshit and are dumb enough to believe it.  Nobody cares either, everyone is sick of hearing this crap from you cultists, go ahead and die, we won't miss your crap.  So go out and party, live life like it's your last day because maybe it will be.  You have no idea how regretful you'll be when you can't get breath; I've been there and was certain I was dying, several times.  I might yet, but not because I willfully caused it, it was somebody else's carelessness who DIDN'T CARE.

<p>Weird, life is normal in Florida and Texas. Where were all those mass deaths in Texas after the Super Bowl? I remember you people <em>itching</em> for them to die. And when it never happened, you pivoted and went to something else.</p>
<p>&rt;If you get the Delta variant, you're in deep shit, it's killing people, people who are unvaccinated. </p>
<p>Huh, weird. In Canada where I live, even vaccinated people are told they get it. Or that the vaccine doesn't work against new variants. Which is it?</p>
<p>&rt;That's ALL the occupants of hospitals are republicans who listen to that bullshit and are dumb enough to believe it</p>
<p>Is that why Andrew Cuomo threw out all of those ventilators despite saying he needed them? There are entire packets of them found in landfills - some in DeathSantis' Florida. Weird, eh? </p>
<p>How many hospitals are overwhelmed? I'm sure you have the data. Enlighten us! </p>

<p>I've heard these threats before. You're 16 months too late. We didn't get the plague of the century but you helped destroy the lives of millions who can no longer provide for their families. Who is paying for the healthcare system? Taxpayers. And when they can no longer pay into it, quality of life declines across the board. Eventually you won't be able to pay for drugs to help with the common cold. And we did it all because you were so afraid to go outside. Now, you expect low income workers and those who are on Amazon's slave wages to deliver you your food, clothes, electronics and other necessities you won't get yourself. Sounds very nice.</p>
<p>I can taste the foam in your mouth. You just hate people going outside and living their lives, don't you?</p>

        <p>I share your sentiments, but your survival rate is a bit off.</p>
<p>For people under 18 the best estimate for a survival rate as per the CDC (1) is a staggering 99.998%.</p>
<p>For people over 18 and below 50, it is 99.95%.</p>
<p>For people over 49 and younger than 65, it is 99.4%.</p>
<p>For people 65 and over, it is 91%.</p>
<p>Calculating the average survival rate across all those numbers would leave us with a 97.587% survival rate, however every healthy person under 65 has over a 99% chance of survival.</p>

        <p>Yeah in order to make vaccines more quickly to be able to fight new emerging diseases (which has happened more and more often in the last 100 years because we are so interconnected).
New methods such as RNA-based vaccines have been developed. 
But ALL vaccines use the same basic concept: inoculation of a harmless strain or component of that strain to induce a T-cel memory response by your immune system. This basic concept has been tested in clinical trials (over very long periods of time) and these findings can be extrapolated to new vaccines that use this same central concept.</p>
<p>Vaccines aren't drugs! They don't induce a specific (and possibly negative) alteration in your body on its own. Vaccines simply give your immune system something to work with. 
Your immune system has evolved over millions of years to be very modular and independently be able to induce very specific responses to some antigenic component that might end up in your body. Including but not limited to: proteins on the surface of pathogens (such as SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins) pollen and many others.</p>
<p>If the vaccine has long term detrimental effects (which it most likely doesn't) than that means the virus itself MUST have long-term detrimental effects.
This is because THE VACCINE IS (a less dangerous version of) THE VIRUS.</p>
<p>I must admit, giving covid vaccines to children is very unnecessary and might even cause issues in the development of their immune system and lead to allergies or auto-immune diseases. I completely agree with you bunch on that.</p>

        <p>2%?  For whom?</p>
<p>You're assigning a blanket mortality rate so you have to specify the age group.  For the young and healthy, it's 0.0002%.</p>
<p>For the young adults, maybe it's very slightly less.  For middle-aged adults, it might be 99.9% by now considering that the virus ran its course a year ago already.</p>
<p>Please be more specific.  Even the CDC admits that the mortality rate is seriously low.</p>
<p>And most people who get covid do NOT need hospitalization.  Be more specific with your age groups.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And stop calling every death a covid death.  PCR does not equal covid regardless of what anyone says.</p>

        <p>Everyone needs the vaccine so you wont kill people that are vulnerable to it by spreading it even more, and so that hospitals will have more resources to treat the sick at one time. Why are we still arguing whether you, as an individual, die from it? What does it matter if you can spread it to someone that might actually die?</p>

        <p>I worked in a hospital the entire "pandemic" until I was laid off last month.  The REAL pandemic was between March and May of 2020.  Hospitals everywhere have been back to normal occupancy ever since.   </p>
<p>When you work in a hospital and deal with traveling techs who go to hospitals all over the country, you get the real story. </p>

        <p>Let's take a quick assumption about a universe where the covid vaccines were tested and developed over that length of time. How would people react? More importantly, how would this sub react? I'd bet you a large amount of money that it would all be something along the lines of, "the vaccine isn't real!" or, "just give us the vaccine, hurry up!" Don't act as if you would be all accepting about the covid vaccine if it took so long to be developed.</p>

        <p>I never said or assumed you were a flat earther or a conspiracy theorist, just a dumbass. If the covid vaccine took 15 years to make the pandemic would either be over, or it wouldn't. Either it would be useless or we would have had to struggle through the pandemic for 15 years. Neither situation is good. And answer this question: in this 15-years-and-covid-is-still-going-on scenario, would you take the vaccine?</p>

You aren't being forced to get a vaccine and people are getting on with their lives.

        <p>Except here in Canada, where I live, we're all still locked down. And at least one province (Manitoba) is actually issuing official government "vaccine cards" now.  </p>
<p>What I want is for people to mind their own god damned business when it comes to <em>private medical information.</em> What I want is for my children to be able to go to school and socialize with their friends. What I want is for the police to focus on actual crimes instead of harassing and fining people for gathering, laughing, and shaking hands. What I want is for pastors to not be thrown in fucking jail for holding church services. What I want is for political leaders to be held accountable when they openly flout the rules that they themselves forced upon the rest of us.  </p>

        <p>You are deliberately obtuse;  WHAT I WANT, WHAT I WANT, WHAT I WANT; YOU SOUND like a honking goose, oblivious to millions of deaths.   Any intelligent government enacts public health policies to protect it's population.  That's all they're doing and you'd be the one bitching if they did nothing.  Some people are like that, complaining about everything no matter what is done.   PEOPLE LIKE YOU. Oh my God!  It's people like YOU that have made this a nightmare not opening your fucking eyes and wanting to NEVER be inconvenienced by anything, even though millions have lost their lives to a preventable infection spread by PEOPLE LIKE YOU.  Now the variants are getting more infectious, more deadly and you know who's getting them?  PEOPLE LIKE YOU. Go ahead and let your kids get sick if you hate inconvenience, get sterile, get erectile dysfunction, liver, kidney, heart and brain damage because your eyes were closed and you can't read what everyone else can.</p>

        <p>Vaccine cards/passes/ IDs and making un vaxxed people wear masks is fucking D I S C R I M I N A T I O N. I don't care about "it's a private business it can make it's own rules" bullshit. This is public shaming and segregation is what it is, if employers and airlines can pull this stunt then discrimination based on race/gender/weight is okay. Stop the double standards and realize that our global government and mega corporations are trying persecute people who didn't get this vaccine. You shouldn't have to inject your self with a substance to have basic rights to work, travel, and buy/sell goods. Vaccinated people more than anyone should be appalled and standing up for us because we're a minority.</p>

        <p>No, they aren't PERSECUTING you or shaming you either.  Start your own airline if you want to fly unvaccinated.  You know perfectly well they have a right to refuse anybody who doesn't follow their rules no matter how much you scream.  2200 people have brought down planes recently having shit fits just like yours.  Those people will never fly again unless they charter their own planes.  You don't like the rules?  Drive.  Hahaha, now you demand that the vaccinated be appalled and stand up for you because you're a MINORITY.   Right, see how many converts you can get among people who are NOT totally paranoid nutcases.  You've lost again and you think I'm your wailing wall.  Get Trump to stand up for you; no he's vaccinated.  Face it Dude, you are dealing with a deadly virus and nobody wants it, no matter how much you scream, yell and act out, nobody's willing to die for you.</p>

        <p>Why should I be coerced to get vaccinated when 80% of people and higher are already vaccinated and protected. That doesn't make any sense, if you people are vaccinated than you don't need to worry about people like me. Why should people like me wear masks? You guys are already VACCINATED. Leave me the F alone and let everyone get back to NORMAL. These companies don't have a defense they're pushing an agenda to segregate us for not getting the sting 💉.</p>

        <p>Who's coercing you?  I'm not even vaccinated, I caught Covid last July and I'm still sick.  If that Delta strain comes in my door with the guys that deliver my groceries, I'm dead.  It's 6 times more infectious than the first one and twice as deadly.  Only people getting it are the unvaccinated and they are STILL dying.  I do not understand why you people in this sub are SO ANGRY, that's why I came here; to find out.  Everyone attacks me, calls me names and downvotes me in the extreme as though I'm your enemy.  I keep getting all the words and fury you feel toward ......whoever you're all mad at as though I'm the one COERCING YOU, FORCING YOU to do anything.   You say "LEAVE ME THE F ALONE and let everyone get back to NORMAL".   I didn't chase you down, did you address me?  If you did, I'm sure I replied, but all you want is to be soothed and agreed with.  It's likely you're needle phobic; what a stupid reason to risk your own death.  People who say sting and jab are usually the ones who are scared of a shot.  If you don't like people to answer you, don't attack them.  I'm not a nanny, here to take care of your little baby feelings.  I earned my Medical License 31 years ago this month, I'm an adult and I talk to people like an adult.  I'm not ranting, raving or going through fits of anti-social behavior to exhibit my FEARS and PREJUDICES.  I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND what motivates people who are risking their lives.  If you're so sure there's no risk to you, why are you bitching and raving?  Nobody answers, they attack, just like you.  Your anger gives you away.</p>

        <p>So you expect the low wage worker to deliver you your food to go out and face the plague while you're so afraid to leave your house? That doesn't sound like selflessness. That sounds like the typical Branch Covidian logic: you stay inside and work from home, while expecting low wage, mostly minority workers to deliver him his food.</p>
<p>You earned your medical license and yet get absolutely e<em>nraged</em> at states that don't hand out vaccine passports as if they're yellow stars. Face it, you w<em>ant</em> people to be locked down. You w<em>ant</em> the government to take care of them forever. You want all this control that you never got before in your life.</p>
<p>Funny, in Canada and the UK, doctors like David Fisman or Michael Warner tell people the vaccine is the 'golden carrot' to give people their freedom and then turn around and says it doesn't work against the variants and we should keep locking down. I'm glad you, as a medical practitioner who likely didn't lift a finger to help anyone at all for the past 18 months, demands so<em>meone else</em> take a risk to deliver you your food. How bourgeois. </p>
<p>Imagine siding up to Big Pharma as a means to 'own' those filthy, unwashed, unclean, low IQ Republicans. We just can't be like those smart, clean, washed and upkept Democrats like Andrew Cuomo.</p>

If I want to die I'll stop eating but I don't so I have to have my food delivered.

My immune system has been fucked for 45 years, I'm the person they were talking about when they said to avoid everybody until it's safe.  You tell me I'm enraged at states that don't hand out vaccine passports....  You're just nuts, I never said a damn thing about these subjects.  You are the person who's enraged.  Like a rabid dog, you're enraged, screaming out your ass like a filthy, unwashed low IQ republican.

<p>Unless it's you. Then you expect people to take care of you. At least 60% of those who died of COVID in the US had obesity. Are you going to tell people to lose weight and restrict their dietary intake to mandate it? Or is that bigoted?</p>

        <p>Oh a "good" source? Nope! Anything I give you will just be "not a good source" to you. That's how you guys play. </p>
<p>I'll link the video to the elected official in Michigan telling people that anyone who tests positive for covid posthumously gets marked as a covid death, even if they died in a car accident or fell off a ladder. You'll just say that's not what she really meant, even though it's literally what she says.</p>
<p>I could post a video of South Dakota's governor taking Biden to task for lying about their numbers and their situation, having never closed down at any point. </p>
<p>You'll just say she's lying. </p>
<p>I could post dozens more videos, all of elected officials, telling you how they count covid deaths. I could post obituaries of people who died in any number of ways, one guy fell off a ladder and the fucking doctor justified the cause of death by saying "well, covid may have caused him to be disoriented." How if they tested positive any time in the last 60 days, covid death no matter what. </p>
<p>You won't believe, or you'll justify it, or you'll do any number of mental gymnastics to prevent yourself from accepting the truth. You all do. </p>
<p>So I don't care if you don't believe it. I really don't. You are cannon fodder and I'm not gonna cry when you go boom. Byeeeeee.</p>
