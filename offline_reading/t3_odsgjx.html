        <p>Yeah, because Sweden were soo successful in their corona plan. They clearly didn't have five times as many deaths as Denmark and clearly didn't suffer financially like everyone else.</p>
<p>Also, nice strawman.</p>

        <p>Yet again, you accuse others of your crimes.  You must be a corn farmer with all the strawmen you erect.</p>
<p>Denmark has a much higher gdp per capita than sweden.  That means more economic resiliency and has a better medical system.  This with almost half the population of sweden.  Why didn't you present any of this?  Maybe because it hurts your argument?  Confirmation bias much?</p>

        <p>Please enlighten me to how me presenting facts is a strawman?</p>
<p>Much higher, huh? Didn't know ≈8% was much higher and the reason for Sweden's financial loss. Denmark and Sweden are identical in every way when it comes to medical standard. Sweden isn't some third world country, like America. Denmark has 5,8 million, Sweden has 10,2 million. Not almost half. I didn't present these, because they're irrelevant to Sweden's handling of Corona and their failure compared to Denmark. You know this, but you think it changes everything.</p>
<p>Didn't you people also claim Sweden didn't have any financial losses? Now they have financial losses but only because they're super poor in your mind.</p>

        <p>There are other absurdities in your reply, but this one is all I need.  Remember, you brought up economic impact, not me.</p>
<p>&rt;I didn't present these, because they're irrelevant to Sweden's handling of Corona and their failure compared to Denmark.</p>
<p>So countries' population and economy are irrelevant when you're talking about disease and economic impact?  Yep, you just said the economy is irrelevant when talking about the economy.  Lol!</p>
<p>Thank you!  You've been a great crowd!  ✌</p>

        <p>I guess I have to explain it to you like you're five. It has no relevance when looking at Denmark and Sweden, because they're almost identical in every way, so the impact on the economy has nothing to do with size and income, and all about how they have handled it. What difference does the population do in your mind?</p>
<p>Do you need me to explain it to you like you're two?</p>

        <p>I was wrong, Denmark isn't as economically resilient compared to Sweden.</p>
<p>https://www.thelocal.dk/20210218/denmarks-economy-worst-hit-in-nordic-countries-by-coronavirus/</p>
<p>So, what was that about Sweden being hit hard compared to Denmark?  You know, how you were saying Sweden's lax Covid response hit their economy hard compared to Denmark.</p>
<p>So, even though Denmark is significantly more wealthy, their economy was hit harder and isn't recovering as well.</p>
<p>Still, you said the economy is irrelevant when talking about the economy.  You can't backpedal or insult your way out of that.  The fact you resort to insults as a way to disprove my arguments is basically an admission of defeat anyway.</p>

        <p>Denmark is not significantly more wealthy than Sweden. The reason for Sweden's smaller decrease in gdp is because of they chose a looser take on restrictions, which resulted in four times as many deaths per million. How the economy has been hit is irrelevant to how they handled it.</p>
<p>I'm not backpedaling on anything, I'm trying to explain how Sweden has taken a worse method compared to Denmark, without any benefits from it.</p>
<p>Who is insulting you? How can I disprove you, you haven't said anything that needs disproving.</p>

        <p>Supposedly almost nobody in Sweden has ever worn a mask, and the few people who have worn masks have always been laughed at.</p>
<p>I wish it was that way here. Mask usage is still disturbingly high in the US, something like seven weeks after retailers dropped mandatory masks.</p>
