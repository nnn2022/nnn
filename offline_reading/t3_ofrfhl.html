    <strong>I wished I died from covid19 instead of the good people of the world.</strong>
    <p><p>I am a 24 year old physically healthy female and everyday I wish I died from covid19, I wish I didn't feel this way. During the lockdown there was stories about the lives of doctors, nurses, care home staff, paramedics and other front line workers who died from covid19. There was this one story in the news of a¬†¬†nurse in her early¬† 30s who died from covid19 and it has actually deeply effected me. I felt like it wasn't fair the nurse died but I am still alive in this world. The nurse had so much to live for ie married, had 3 kids and had a purpose in life which was to heal.¬† </p>
<p>The stories I read¬† about the front line workers who died from covid19 their lives were so amazing, they were just good people loved by everyone and had a¬† lot to live for.¬† It's not fair why is it the good people of the world, people with a lot to live for die so early whereas the bad people who bring suffering¬† to¬† the¬† world ie murderous dictators, serial killers end up living so much longer. </p>
<p>In my own family and wider community I live in people I know have died from covid19 were just good people with so much to live for. It's not fair why is it the people who are good people or love life end up dying so young and early whereas people who are evil and bring suffering to the world live so much longer ie murderous dictators in history, serial killers etc. </p>
<p>I am not a bad person but I am not a great person either with not much¬† to live for really . I am single, no children,,lost in life and just a total embrassment and burden¬† my family who would be better off without me. I failed to have my life together at 24 its humiliating. My relative is her 20s she is getting married soon everybody in the family is talking about her upcoming wedding , my friends have stable jobs and live on their own.¬† I live my parents and rely on them it's so embarrassing. </p>
<p>How is it fair or even a blessing according to religious people that I am alive when I don't even deserve to be ? </p>
<p>If I could I would give my good health to someone seriously ill from covid19 so they can live and be with their spouses, children and loved ones. If anyone should be dying from covid19 it really should be me. </p>
<p>Does anyone feel the lockdown has questioned thier existence?</p></p>

        <p>I really don‚Äôt know what to say to this except for if you‚Äôre not trolling, you should go to therapy or something. On one hand lockdown has you questioning your existence yet you‚Äôre mad at covid for taking away ‚Äúgood people‚Äù, are you in support of lockdowns or not? A lot of us have been questioning existence with lockdowns, more in the ‚Äúthis life isn‚Äôt worth living‚Äù way and not the ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt be alive because we‚Äôre not worthy and should have died of covid‚Äù way. </p>
<p>Survivors guilt is a thing, it seems you may be experiencing a form of this as well as depression in regards to your own life and situation. </p>
<p>24 is so young. So so young, you have many years to find a relationship and go out on your own. Those things don‚Äôt make life what it is. I don‚Äôt have much else to say other than talking to someone would probably help you a lot.</p>

        <p>EnoNesha thank you so much.  I don't even know where to begin that's the thing everyday I wake up feeling so lost and absolutely nothing to wake up for. I dont have a job to go or  a man to enjoy my day with and my family have a there own thing going on. My parents got their work, my sister got her school life, my grandmother is doing her activities and taking to relatives aboard.  I don't have a place or routine which is am struggling to cope with. </p>
<p>My family don't understand me at all they never have . If I was actually helped to live and find my purpose and routine I wouldn't find death so appealing. I am just drowning and overwhelmed death is so much better and so freeing .</p>

        <p>I hear you my dear. And I hear your wish for someone to help you and support you.</p>
<p>I can very easily wish for you to find that in your life.</p>
<p>If you will forgive me saying. It sounds like there is hurt you carry for you to work on. Try and get yourself set up with a job first of all, build some confidence and independence... And if there is still a need, some therapy to help you make sense of these things.</p>
<p>You sound like a good person, I hope you find your way ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè</p>

        <p>Kezia_Griffin when we are teenagers we are always told at 18 we become adults . The longer I live past 18 the less younger I feel and I just feel like I am running out of time.¬† </p>
<p>We live in a culture that magnifies youth success especially within a persons early 20s or even teens. We are constantly over exposed to young people being successful ie forbes under 30 list, Youth activists featuring on Time magazine, women's magazines features of the young successful high flyer woman who has an apartment,a boyfriend and massive career , greta thunberg her success so young, reality TV stars, tik tok , influencer culture etc </p>
<p>It's not just celebrities it's also my former classmates are just have their lives together ie career, marriage etc. </p>
<p>It is hard not to feel like a failure when people in your age group are doing massive things with their lives. If you are young and successful society puts you on a pedestal no other generation ever had to deal with this. In previous generations 5 -10 people would be famous but now more people are becoming famous due to reality TV shows, competition shows ie concerts x factor, Netflix shows world wide growing the pool of young and new  talent </p>
<p>On my 24th birthday I felt no joy and all I felt was I¬† just wasted my life because I have not doing anything huge before 30. I don't even know where to start everyday I feel so lonely and lost.</p>

        <p>Sol_sleepy thank you so much I will look at the video this week I will soon be going to bed. </p>
<p>It is not fair just seeing people die from covid19 with so much to live for . My neighbour died from covid19 he was a kind to everyone in the neighbourhood and had 3 children all under ten. He was the sole bread winner of the family and very loving father. His¬† children were always just laughing and having fun with their parents.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic my neighbour was always outside with his children and his wife but now every day it just feels weird seeing his wife and children without their father. </p>
<p>There is nothing for me in this world. My family would be absolutely devastated if I died but they would be better off without me a life time of sadness is not a big deal compared to me being in thier lives and my problems that come with it. If I died today there would be no more worrying about me and no more arguments. I am an embrassment to my family ie have not got a career,  not engaged like my relatives and I am a loser.</p>
<p>I feel overwhelmed with everything and i am the wrong person alive . I wake up everyday I just don't belong here in this world I feel completely out of place all the time.</p>

<p>There is spiritual significance to feeing this way.  Even Jesus talked about being ‚Äúin the world, but not of this world.‚Äù</p>
<p>John 17:14 KJV</p>
<p>I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>
<p>1 John 4:5 KJV</p>
<p>They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them. We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre only feeling this way because of a struggle to see the bigger picture.  Don‚Äôt let you demons control your emotions and perceptions about yourself. You are here with purpose and you are important in this world. </p>
<p>Have faith.  I pray that you will find fulfillment and purpose.  Please don‚Äôt give up hope.</p>

        <p>Your life is so much more. Stop giving a fuck about what people think. Look around at the world, this place is not normal, the shit thats going on constantly in the world is fucked. Its constant stress, anxiety, and fear pushed by the media/government. The entire system is built to break you and everyone in it to conform to it and feed it. </p>
<p>You‚Äôre not a disgrace, a fuck up, or anything of the sort. You‚Äôre a living spirit in a human body, you have power, why do you think they want you depressed and questioning if your good enough? Because if you‚Äôre not in a state of anxiety, fear, stress, and depression you‚Äôre not feeding the system and becoming a better person. </p>
<p>You don‚Äôt have any accolades the system tells everyone is important? Fuck that, cant take that with you after you die. You‚Äôre a special and unique soul that just needs to find out more about yourself and break the chains of self doubt this system has placed on you. You can do it. </p>
<p>(Im using system loosely. You can say World/reality/NWO/satan, whatever sticks for you. Bottom line whatever you call it, it is evil and feeds off of negative energy)</p>

        <p>I think you have a skewed measurement of your own worth. You don‚Äôt gain or lose worth based on your accomplishments or your failures. You have worth because God made you in his image. You are handcrafted and loved by God. </p>
<p>So it‚Äôs not for you to say ‚ÄúI should have died in their place because I‚Äôm worth less than them.‚Äù It‚Äôs God‚Äôs will to give every person a certain amount of time on this earth and that‚Äôs not for you to decide. But what are you going to do with the time he‚Äôs given you? My deepest suggestion is to love and worship God, Jesus Christ. That is how one fulfills their purpose. </p>
<p>Jesus knows your failures and he loves you anyway. He sees your sin and he loves you anyways. He took the punishment that was meant for you because of your sin and he took it upon himself. He took the death that we deserved because of our rebellion against God and he died in our place on the cross. And because of his sacrifice, if we trust in him that he has paid our debt, then through him, we can have a right relationship with God. And after we die, we‚Äôll go to be with him eternally in heaven. That is your purpose.</p>

        <p>In the lockdown in the UK  doctors were giving people with learning disabilities and elderly people Do not resuscitate orders. The families of the people who had learning disabilities and elderly people went to the media to expose this practice. It was very shocking at the time when the media reported it.  It even led to hospitals across the county being investigated. </p>
