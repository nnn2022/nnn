        <p>Still considered a crazy conspiracy to the majority. Even on this sub and especially on LockdownSkepticism. I like the fact people are just saying that many of the governments are just incompetent and have no idea what they're doing when it comes to this Covid19 crisis.</p>
<p>How and why this is the case I have no idea considering the information is out there and many institutions and politicans have said things will never go back to normal. It's not some secret leaked information by some whistleblower. It's actually hilarious how obvious many governments are reading off of the same script.</p>
<p>At this point, if they do manage to pull off The Great Reset then hats off to them. The people are to blame if this nightmare becomes a reality. Way too many intellectually lazy people who refuse to do their due diligence and look for the truth.</p>
<p>The sheep are being led to the slaughter and my empathy for them is running out.</p>

        <p>Yes i see a lot of people who are sort of in denial of what is happening yet not doomers. They "assume" the governor or leaders are incompetent and thats why they make all these nonsensical desicions when in reality their goal is to destroy small buisnesses. Covid is essenntially  what they are using to bring in the nwo order aka the great reset</p>
<p>Its like their brain is in denial that their goverment might actually be going tyranical or they are too scared to be labeled a conspiracy theorist. But the great reset is not a conspiracy its legit  on the world economic forum</p>

        <p>It is what it is at this point. The masses simply cannot see what this Covid19 crisis really is about.</p>
<p>We even have people in this sub and LockdownSkepticism thinking The Great Reset is a crazy conspiracy theory, even though it's out there for everyone to see.</p>

        <p>You're spot on and what you're seeing now is the soft-reset via wrongthink on masks. "IF ONLY EVERYONE DID X BEHAVIOR FOR Y PERIOD WE WOULDN'T HAVE THE PROBLEMS EVERYONE KNEW WOULD HAPPEN ANYWAY", etc.</p>
<p>Now, they're going to blame voting being corrupt, despite people like us screaming this since 2000 or earlier.</p>
<p>I have no sympathy for people that are actually stupid enough to reinforce the system that makes them poor.</p>
<p>I run a small business and I have a million ways to make money no matter how bad shit gets. I didn't get to where I am by pretending the government gives a fuck about me, and I never vote. Funny how I have money and security somehow despite that, huh?</p>
<p>Enjoy the decline, fuck these sub human pieces of shit right in their low IQ, if they have the synaptic capacity to even fucking feel it.</p>

        <p>covid 1984 isn't a pandemic... It's a manufactured crisis to give excuses for house arrest lockdowns and the destruction of private businesses.</p>
<p>The covid hoax was created in order to pave way for the great reset agenda, which is ultimately communism and depopulation.These clowns at the WEF talk about capitalism and socialism needing to merge together, that doesn't even make any sense.</p>
<p>Capitalist societies are democratic, socialist societies are de facto dictatorships, nobody can name one country that went socialist/communist and held elections under that environment.</p>
<p>Covid is a hoax, please don't type that it's a "pandemic"</p>

        <p>Sooner or later being in denial will no longer be an option because it will become all too obvious. The agenda is going full speed ahead with no signs of stopping.</p>

        <p>Lol, as soon as I heard Schwab and then Prince Charles state, "...a rare but narrow window..."</p>
<p>I'd love to know...why?  If this plan is going to be the best thing for the world...why does it need to wait for a "world crisis"?  Wouldn't a solid plan be recognizable as such?  Wouldn't a well thought-out and comprehensive plan for a better world have the merits as such?</p>
<p>If it's a narrow window...why is it closing?  The plandemic is required?  If the plandemic goes away by itself (which is what nature does) why does the awesome plan no longer work?</p>
<p>If crisis is needed...a fearful population...is that wise to make decisions in a state of fear?  Is fear the only way people would accept this plan?</p>
<p>If everyone here wants to see me open up a can of whoop-ass on Klaus Schwab, gimme a "Hell Yeah!"</p>
