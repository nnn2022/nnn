    <strong>Changing Opinions on Lockdowns - Action Isn't Taken Overnight</strong>
    <p><p>I've been making a serious of videos trying to elaborate on certain aspects of the pandemic and the restrictions. I'll add a written summary below. Here is the video</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09QyYIC6Yw&amp;ab_channel=TheFifthPerspective">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09QyYIC6Yw&amp;ab_channel=TheFifthPerspective</a></p>
<p><strong>Ending Restrictions and Social Inertia</strong></p>
<p>I live in a region that has been fairly pro-restriction for the past 11 months. As the restrictions continue (we currently have a curfew, as well as no restaurants/bars/gyms/indoor sports/private gatherings) the opinion of the majority of the population has begun to change. Now, if you go on our local, provincial, or national subreddits, you'll find a lot more people expressing displeasure with the measures in place.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this hasn't, as of yet, translated into changes in restrictions. I also keep seeing here, on a lockdown skeptical subreddit, a lot of posts/comments suggesting that people won't stand for XYZ once a certain milestone has been reached (low cases, low deaths, high enough vaccinations...).</p>
<p>I don't see this being true for many countries or states that have been more strongly pro-restriction. Pro vs. anti restriction is not simply binary - there is a continuum of stances to take that range from strongly adhering to every rule and being vocal about it, to passively adhering to the majority of the rules and not talking about it, to being somewhat anti-restriction, to being actively anti-restriction and "storming the Bastille".</p>
<p>Most people won't change their stance very strongly overnight. What has been happening is that they start very pro-restriction, and slowly move to the otherside over weeks and months as the disconnect between what they were promised and reality sets in. Most people are not willing or able to devote enough energy to quickly changing their opinion on something as important as this - just like a young idealistic left-leaning individual may take decades to slowly change their views on the role of government in society, or a racist may need years of interacting with people of a certain race to stop judging them by superficialities.</p>
<p>Many people where I live made fun of Florida earlier in the pandemic, as we thought the way they fought every restriction that could be implemented would lead to a worse outcome for them. I can certainly imagine that a strong desire to not have restrictions, in any type of crisis virus-related or not, can sometimes lead to worse outcomes. Almost a year later, we may be seeing the other side of the coin. Regions like my own, that have been so pro-restriction for so long are stuck not being "ready" to reopen because too many people were too far in one direction to adapt to new data or circumstances. Media that have been very pro-restriction can only bit by bit start reporting a bit more evenly on the positives and negatives of restrictions. Governments would be criticized if they switch too quickly, as it would make it seem like they previously made a mistake.</p>
<p>Last summer I had to wait until mid June (I forget the exact date - perhaps the 22nd?) to be allowed to play a sport outdoors (not in a league or anything, simply with a few friends). At that point we had almost no hospitalizations or cases, no stress on the medical system... but it took all the way until the longest day of the year to engage legally in a basic and healthy activity. How long will we be waiting this year?</p>
<p>Please tell me what you think. I'll try to make more videos/posts like this on underexamined aspects of the pandemic, if interests exist.</p></p>

        <p>I think that what you wrote is the sad, inevitable truth. But I can't help but think... God forbid the government admit they made a mistake, or were wrong about something, and not wait 20 years to do so. It might cause some people to not trust them implicitly. ðŸ™„</p>
