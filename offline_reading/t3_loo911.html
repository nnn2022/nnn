    <strong>I Can't Believe I Used To Watch This Guy</strong>
    <p><p>I used to listen to a guy who talked about politics named Hunter Avallone. He was conservative but now he says he's libertarian. Although he does still point out some crazy things about the left, he's mainly liberal now and basically his opinions are always what the majority think.</p>
<p>I can't believe someone who cared so much about freedom now says "If you're anti-mask, you're anti-science" and "Only pussies can't wear a piece of fabric over their faces." More like only pussies want to wear a piece of fabric over their faces because there's a spooky virus out there. I've been noticing so many people recently just stop thinking for themselves because they just think the majority opinion must always be right and so they don't have any conflict. The young generation is just so pathetic. I wish I wasn't a part of it.</p>
<p>He basically now just says whatever majority opinion wants to hear and uses a bunch of cliché talking points. No one has any hills to die on anymore, they just agree with everyone, unless they're hated by the majority.</p>

<p>The funniest thing is how someone said it's stupid to call anyone but a cultist a sheep, as if this mentality isn't like a cult. </p></p>

        <p>People my age (college here) just seem so shallow. Just go along with what everyone else says, don't really have lives, etc. I was a senior in high school last year and so many kids in my class just kept talking about how depressed they were but how they also didn't want to try and do anything. And they don't need to think since everyone does it for them.</p>

        <p>Yeah, these last generations have been engineered into passivity to make way for the New Normal. It's very sad, terribly difficult to deal with as a average person in practice. But it's really great you did not conform.</p>

        <p>I was always different. Lots of people say it's just because my parents brainwashed me or whatever but they never forced politics on me and even when I was in high school and they did a little, if I disagreed with them, I disagreed with them. Whenever there's an issue on anything, I don't just listen to what my side of politics says or what my parents or friends say. I think what my opinion is first. Every opinion I have comes from within. I did have a pretty different childhood, though. I grew up pretty far away from people, in the middle of the woods, so I guess that's how I was able to form my own opinions without just thinking what others think. As a child, I was always kind of outside of everyone in my class. Like I was just watching, but not really a part of it. I always had strongly held opinions for as long as I could remember.</p>

        <p>Well it sounds like you parents gave you lots of space to be yourself. That for obvious reasons, can place you on a metaphorical island, but imo is one of the best things a parent could do. Idk how I'd react having a child that just won't think for themselves.</p>

        <p>Actually, no. It was just politics they didn't push on me. But religion, and lots of other things, like what they thought was right and what they thought was wrong. It was only once I was older they started talking to me about politics. They had lots of ways they wanted me to be and I almost always disagreed with it. We do happen to tend to agree on politics, but trust me, if we didn't, we wouldn't. I was never afraid to have a different opinion than them. I would go with whatever I thought to make the most sense, whether it was what they thought or not. I would never do that to my kids, though. When I do have kids someday, I will let them be themselves.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure if I’m the same age as you but I definitely relate to this a lot. I had a weird but kind of awesome childhood too and spent a lot of time in the woods. I wonder if there’s a correlation between that and what makes us think this way?</p>

        <p>His facial structure has changed significantly since he became a liberal, it's not good. Hunter was always slightly below average in intelligence, he's very impressionable and has no clue what he's talking about. Don't believe me? Look at his Tim Pool interview. He didn't know anything.</p>
