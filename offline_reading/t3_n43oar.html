    <strong>The results of the NEJM mRNA vaccine pregnancy study are alarming but being misrepresented</strong>
    <p><p>Some of you may be aware of <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983">a recent CDC-backed study published in the New England Journal of Medicine regarding the safety of mRNA vaccines for pregnant women</a>. It was widely read and influenced policy statements by health regulators. The crux of its findings were this: the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines do not demonstrate an elevated risk of miscarriage, as 12.6% of vaccinated women experienced a miscarriage, neatly tracking with the average 10-15% rate.</p>
<p>However, this is grossly misleading because of the breakdown of its participants.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322634#pregnancy-loss-rates-by-age">I'll provide one source for this</a>, but it can be verified by most other sources if you choose to do your own research. The vast majority, about 80%, of miscarriages occur in the first trimester (up to week 13). That means for a 10-15% miscarriage rate generally, the miscarriage rate is only about 2-3% assuming you've made it to the second trimester. If you were to evenly sample pregnant women, 1/3 in the beginning of the first trimester, 1/3 in the beginning of the second trimester, 1/3 in the beginning of the third trimester, and study their miscarriage rate, assuming a total 15% miscarriage rate in the general population, it should be roughly 1 / 3 * 0.15 + 2 / 3 * 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.07 = 7%. This is because 2/3 of the sample is in a pool that has only 20% the risk for an entire pregnancy because they're already past the most dangerous part (it's worth noting incidentally that <a href="https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/177/11/1271/97504">some studies put the risk past the first trimester even lower</a>).</p>
<p>This is where the results of the study mislead. Of the women observed in the study, 28.3%+2.3%=30.6% were either before or in their first trimester, 43.3% in the second, and 25.7% in the third at the time of vaccination. In fact, first trimester were even less than a third. Taking 31% to be in or before their first trimester, a back-of-the-napkin estimate is slightly lower: 0.31 * 0.15 + (1 - 0.31) * 0.15 * 0.2 = 0.0672 = 6.72%. <strong>For this sample, this should be the expected miscarriage rate. And yet it's nearly double that!</strong></p>
<p>This is a strange oversight on the part of the study, which does not make an effort to compare its results with data available for the general population.</p>
<p>There are a couple other statistical reasons why this result is out of proportion with the general public. For example, non-Hispanic white women made up 76% of the sample, despite being 63% of the population (and given the graying of the white population, probably even lower in the relevant age bracket), while Black women only made up 1.3%, despite being over 13%, and white women are documented to have a significantly lower risk for miscarriages than Black women. Furthermore, Asians are overrepresented while Hispanics and American Indians are underrepresented, with miscarriage rates being lower for Asians and higher for Hispanics and American Indians. This raises another unanswered but important concern about the study: the possibility that the sample studied underrepresents people with inadequate access to healthcare.</p>
<p>I'm making no overall statement about the relative risk/reward of taking the vaccine, pregnant or otherwise. I also don't want to imply malice on the part of the researchers; oversights and mistakes are common in research and corrections are a part of the process. But this data is being presented in a duplicitous way, and for the study to reach its topline conclusion that no concern is raised by the data, it had to have been very obtuse.</p></p>

        <p>Good analysis! More shocking is that this wasnâ€™t an actual trial, they just based on off the reports from vaers and v-safe. And we know vaers captures typically less than 1% of AEs.</p>
