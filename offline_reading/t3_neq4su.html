    <strong>Kudos to Zaxby's</strong>
    <p><p>So, a couple of weeks ago, my local Zaxby's finally opened up indoor dining again after a pretty lackluster drive-thru only service.</p>
<p>My family and I have been going to this particular location since it opened in mid-2018.  We even started going there weekly before the pandemic started.</p>
<p>However, around the time we started our mask mandate (and even some time after it was lifted), they went drive-thru only and it resulted in things getting super slow.  Very few employees actually worked there during that time, which just made things worse.  We started going there less and less.</p>
<p>Jump forward to present day, my first time visiting since they reopened, my dad's second.  We notice that not only are most customers not wearing masks, but the employees aren't wearing them either!</p>
<p>When we finished eating, one of the employees walked up to us and asked how our food was, and we had a small conversation about how the business has been doing.  A couple of points stood out to me.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They offered old employees their jobs back with an added bonus to their pay.  The employee talking with us was included.  Places left open after the offer were filled by new employees, and they used the last few weeks before reopening to TRAIN them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I heard it correctly, Zaxby's left it up to the owners of individual locations to decide how/if they wanted to enforce masks.  The owner of this location decided to let the customers AND employees go in mask-free if they wanted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This resulted in Zaxby's operating almost exactly as it did pre-pandemic.  They still serve the food in to-go packaging indoors instead of trays, and the ketchup dispenser isn't out, but we were told that those things will be addressed soon.</p>
<p>Overall, Zaxby's is one of, if not the most normal restaurant (and possibly business) in my entire hometown, and I am very happy they made a near-full recovery!</p>
<p>Now, I wonder how much longer it will take for other restaurants to follow their example...</p></p>
