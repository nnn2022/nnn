    <strong>We Need Vax Segregation!</strong>
    <p><p>Rabid, virulent, dogmatic and eternal "anti-vaxxer" here. I am totally FOR the segregation of society based on vax status. Why? Because it's the only way to let the vaxxed have their cake and eat it too.  And I firmly support letting arrogant, ignorant and valueless people eat that cake until they choke on it.</p>
<p>We should not be troubled. We should be in the shadows smiling, encouraging the imbeciles to go play in traffic some more. They are already doomed. They are all going to die soon, if not from these initial 2 shots, then from the dozens of boosters their loving governments have planned for them. So let them party on. Let them have their shopping and their traveling. It's all temporary anyways. The world belongs to the jab-free eventually.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the stuck start pulling up lame and diseased, despite the expulsion of the unstuck from every public venue, who will they blame then?</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, people like us, with still functioning bodies and brains, can quietly and quickly start creating the society we want. The Old Normal and The New Normal is not what we want for ourselves and our children anyways. We should let the Slaver system and its willing slaves implode into a mass of Graphene Goo and be damn happy about it. </p>
<p>We, as Covid heretics, should step back and let them have all the "safe space" play time they want. We should not be disappointed by any of this. The world's largest intelligence test has been administered (see the Australian PM's comments yesterday for more clarity) and those that are ignorant, stupid or have misplaced values such as throwing away their health to keep their jobs or to travel, have now all been identified. These people have always been the anchor towards a society we can love and take pride in.</p>
<p>So, for now, take cover and protest not the rapid destruction of those begging for it. The future belongs to us!</p></p>

        <p>I think some form of segregation will be the only workable solution in the end.</p>

        <p>Yes. This is it. This is the positivity we need. We are moving forward not backwards, we are making the true sacrifice that allows freedom. Great post.</p>

        <p>I like the overall sentiment but cringe at “segregation”... it’s our government pushing for this, not every vaxxed person.  They want us to keep infighting... it serves TPTB’s interest.</p>
