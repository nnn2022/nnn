    <strong>I should be to blame the media says? FUCK EM</strong>
    <p><p>I been locked up for 1½ year here in EU, havent seen anyone besides my landlord (who live in same house building) and a single friend a couple of times. And ofcause delivery guys etc.</p>
<p>I havent taken the vaccine because im born with bad heart, and their is tons of people who get problems with their heart after taken the vaccine! So i wont risk it!</p>
<p>But i now have to understand that i am to blame for this? Because im not vaccinated with their "miracle cure" they made in 4 months.</p>
<p>Can some one explain how i is to blame? I havent had any contact with anyone, have stayed home 24/7 for 1½ year... 18 months staying inside my fucking shitty 4 walls, i should be to blame for not wanna take the vaccine?</p>
<p>And now i have to understand we cant go out if we aint fully vaccinated with vaccine passport! Fuck EU, FUCK davos, fuck UN (since they wont uphold our human rights anyway) fuck everything.</p>
<p>Why should i care anymore? I been locked up for 1½ year, and im now to be blamed for variants that started in India? REALLY?</p>
<p>I done everything, and is now to blamed because i dont wanna take a experimental drugs that is made on 4 months! Fuck it all.</p>
<p>(sorry on a new account since the other got banned by reddit for "Ban evasion" from a sub i never wrote on because im member here and on other "controversies" subs. )</p></p>
