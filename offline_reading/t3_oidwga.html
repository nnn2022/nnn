        <p>Remdisivir is not a cheap drug. I think the dosage needed to treat Covid costs about $2-3,000. Meanwhile, drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin are substantially cheaper.</p>

        <p>Remdisivir is a killer drug, in the African trails it was removed as one of the common side effects was it shuts down the kidneys.  The kidneys is how we get rid of excess fluids.  Then it appears you have pneumonia then multiple organ failure. Sounds like a covid death huh.</p>

<p>&rt;  Yes please I have a fckn ton of information where you want me to dump :)</p>
<p>Maybe they don't speak english well, I don't know.</p>
<p>And on top of that, the delta variant is hitting rural areas hard.  Once it gets to a community it wrecks it, it just has to get there first but when it happens they get fucked.  Just wait.  Anywhere that's doing well now that has low vaccination rates is going to turn into missouri where they're running out of hospitals. </p>

        <p>Im in a rural area. 
We've got one hospital about 30 minutes away that I pass every day and im friends with a nurse there. </p>
<p>Nothing popping off. Nothing has popped off even over this whole pandemic </p>
<p>The original post simply said the developments were interesting. I dont know why you're reaching into other comments. this must be what moving the goal post is.</p>
<p>the fact that it's attention grabbing is just that. I dont get why your panties are in a twist. You pop up and claim something isn't true. Expect people just just take your word for it over whoever youre pouting about, and it just seems silly to me.</p>
<p>Also~
A lot of my comments as of late are in this sub. </p>
<p>However, 
90% of my comments on average is on porn subs and in dms with fellow consumers of said porn subs thank you very much. </p>
<p>Who said I was an outsider to this sub anyhow? 
Im saying im on the outside of whatever bubble you're sitting in. And from this perspective it just seems like you're  exaggerating.</p>
<p>Youre the one trying to predict the future based theories and sudo statistics. 
The Aztecs tried that with predicting the end of the world and we all know how that went. </p>
<p>I use to have really good conversations with people in other political subs. But I got banned from them for simply being a member in NNN. </p>
<p>Open discourse here is pretty nice. I dont agree with 100% of the stuff here but at the very least I can have a deep conversation about sensitive topics and not get kicked out for having the "wrong" opinion.</p>
<p>I mean even though I font agree with you doesn't mean I think you should be kicked or muted or whatever. I actually like little backs and forths like these. </p>
<p>If other subs were as inclusive and accepting as this one I'd totally have political and world view chats in other places too.</p>

<p>&rt;  Who said I was an outsider to this sub anyhow? </p>
<p>You.  You said you're an outsider looking in when I was saying I was an outsider looking in to describe what I was seeing.  That infer that you are also an outsider.  </p>
<p>&rt;  Im saying im on the outside of whatever bubble you're sitting in. And from this perspective it just seems like you're exaggerating.</p>
<p>Lmao nice save.  Nice save.  Sure.  hahahahah  Oh my god you just can't accept not "winning" and will bend the truth.  It's amazing.</p>
<p>My exaggeration only sounds like one because it was saying what it was on face value, that's what happens when you call out the absurd without using the flowery language those pushing the absurd are using. </p>
<p>&rt;  Youre the one trying to predict the future based theories and sudo statistics</p>
<p>Firstly, it's pseudo, not sudo.  Secondly, they're real statistics so they're not pseudo at all. </p>
<p>&rt;  I use to have really good conversations with people in other political subs. But I got banned from them for simply being a member in NNN. </p>
<p>Is this to try to get me to not talk in here or something out of fear I'll get banned for it? lol  I doubt that's why you got banned and not things like spreading disinformation. </p>
<p>&rt;  I dont agree with 100% of the stuff here but at the very least I can have a deep conversation about sensitive topics and not get kicked out for having the "wrong" opinion.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, because people have been so happy to hear my 2 cents lol.  Multiple comment chains, not just this one.  People don't like me in here even when I'm polite and just point out facts.  </p>
<p>&rt;  If other subs were as inclusive and accepting as this one I'd totally have political and world view chats in other places too.</p>
<p>"if other places allowed me to say things that are patently untrue that if listened to can cause serious harm to people I would talk there more" isn't a great answer, honestly.  I"m not trying to be mean, but you have to think of the consequences of your actions when it comes to this topic.</p>

        <p>You pop up and claim something isn't true. Expect people just just take your word for it over whoever youre pouting about, and it just seems silly to me.</p>
<p>&rt;You: She is being sued by the indian bar association which is not affiliated with the indian government. This would be like me suing you as an individual for work you did as a contractor or something and telling you the death penalty is on the table. It's just not how things work. </p>
<p>And the point still stands. You just pop up and expect spout off a claim and expect people to relate when you're doing the same thing youre huffing and puffing about. </p>
<p>Youre even doing it again. You coulda just sent a link with proof or helped to inform but youre just here to pull random accusations out your butt. At least the OP provided a screen shot. You're not even trying to pretend to be helpful. It's like you get off on complaining about other people. No offense. </p>
<p>In response of your imagur search does it show how active I've been in communities in reference of time or are you just gonna ignore my saying that I've been active here as of late? Do you only share links of things that feed into your biases? </p>
<p>You keep knit picking what you want from my statements to bend them out of context to fit your goals. Whatever they are. I even clarified that I referred to the outsider comment as being outside of this bubble you're shooting your perspective from and you still chose to triple down and present it as me just saying I was an outsider to this subreddit. </p>
<p>&rt;
Firstly, it's pseudo, not sudo. Secondly, they're real statistics so they're not pseudo at all. </p>
<p>Thanks, I always wondered how to spell that word but never got around to checking it. hecking silent p. </p>
<p>But back to the point, there you go again just saying something is true cause you say it is. It's silly because you just seem like you're trying to position yourself as the authority on these matters. I mean you could at least link something to help keep down the confusion or even try not to seem like youre just throwing out claims with nothing to back it. Someone could at least get an idea of where you're pulling your info from whether it's credible or not.</p>
<p>&rt;Is this to try to get me to not talk in here or something out of fear I'll get banned for it? lol I doubt that's why you got banned and not things like spreading disinformation. </p>
<p>What? What would I have to gain from scaring off someone willing to have extensive chat box lengthed talks about random screen shots on sensitive modern topics? </p>
<p>And yeah, in the reasoning for my ban it said it was for participating in NNN. </p>
<p>&rt;Oh, yeah, because people have been so happy to hear my 2 cents lol. Multiple comment chains, not just this one. People don't like me in here even when I'm polite and just point out facts. </p>
<p>You dont get it you adorable little monster. No one needs to enjoy what you're saying. Most people here don't even see you as credible and would find your claim of "sharing facts" as laughable at best.</p>
<p>But where's the fun in just kicking people out? It would be like wanting only the few foods you enjoy to be the only ones in existence. </p>
<p>I think people here can disagree and dislike perspectives while still appreciating the diversity in the comment sections. </p>
<p>I dont think im the only one that enjoys exchanging cheeky comments with other adults in the chat. </p>
<p>&rt;if other places allowed me to say things that are patently untrue that if listened to can cause serious harm to people I would talk there more" isn't a great answer, honestly. I"m not trying to be mean, but you have to think of the consequences of your actions when it comes to this topic.</p>
<p>There you go again creating your own reality out of thin air. 
You created your own oppositional argument and then proceeded to take it down. This part isn't even a response to me youre just talking to yourself and the imaginary version of me you think is an easily target to talk down. </p>
<p>Isn't a great answer, honestly. Im not trying to be mean but you have to think of the consequences of your actions when it comes to conversations like this. </p>
<p>To close I just wanna reitterate that the OPs post was just a point at an interesting development. At the very least the OP provided some sort of evidence of where they were coming from but you popping up and pulling claims out of thin air without even trying to seem credible and then pouting about how noncredible you think others are is pretty mental. </p>
<p>Just an observation from someone outside your bubble.</p>

<p>I'm sorry that I assumed that you knew that india had a liberal democracy and all liberal democracies do not allow civil suits to result in the death penalty.  I'm not trying to be mean, but that's not entirely on me. I tried to explain it politely. </p>
<p>&rt;  You coulda just sent a link with proof or helped to inform but youre just here to pull random accusations out your butt.</p>
<p>Fine.  The wikipedia for indian death penalty links to trial court as the first step https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court  and here ya go:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_India#Trial_court   It affirms everything I said.  You can't be sued to death in india. </p>
<p>&rt;   At least the OP provided a screen shot. You're not even trying to pretend to be helpful</p>
<p>Dude, I'm assuming you're all going to give me shit and that's fine.  I just find this all absurd on its face.  I wouldn't care if it didn't result in people being harmed. </p>
<p>&rt;  In response of your imagur search does it show how active I've been in communities in reference of time or are you just gonna ignore my saying that I've been active here as of late? Do you only share links of things that feed into your biases? </p>
<p>Buddy, this sub has only been around for a year.  Stop digging yourself in a hole.  You're like half porn half not.  You don't get to cherry pick.  If 20% of your comments from your 3 year old account come from one sub that has only been active for a year you are not an outsider to that sub. </p>
<p>&rt;  I even clarified that I referred to the outsider comment as being outside of this bubble you're shooting your perspective from and you still chose to triple down and present it as me just saying I was an outsider to this subreddit. </p>
<p>lmao are you serious?  Oh my god. </p>
<p>&rt;  Someone could at least get an idea of where you're pulling your info from whether it's credible or not.</p>
<p>... What do you want me to cite for you?  I'll do it. </p>
<p>&rt;   Most people here don't even see you as credible and would find your claim of "sharing facts" as laughable at best.</p>
<p>I know they find it laughable.  They think that someone in india is being sued to death. </p>
<p>&rt;  Isn't a great answer, honestly. Im not trying to be mean but you have to think of the consequences of your actions when it comes to conversations like this. </p>
<p>What, someone who refuses to follow covid restrictions won't follow them more because I pointed out how it's bad?</p>
<p>&rt;  To close I just wanna reitterate that the OPs post was just a point at an interesting development.</p>
<p>That's not true. </p>
<p>&rt;  At the very least the OP provided some sort of evidence of where they were coming from but you popping up and pulling claims out of thin air without even trying to seem credible and then pouting about how noncredible you think others are is pretty mental. </p>
<p>No liberal democracy allows someone to be sued to death.  Read the wikipedia on the death penalty in india and trial court if you don't believe me.  You probably understand though that it's the same as the US where I can't sue you to death, only the government has a legitimate monopoly on violence.  Some things, like saying I can't sue you to death in the US, should not need to be cited. </p>
<p>&rt;  Just an observation from someone outside your bubble.</p>
<p>Uh huh.  Sure, in the bubble where the vaccine is harmful, covid isn't a big deal, the vaccine changes the shape of your red blood cells, and a woman is being sued to death for being against a treatment for covid. How exactly does my bubble work?</p>

<p>Was that so hard? This is what sharing perspectives is all about. Now yours actually talking with the chat instead of just huffing and puffing. This simple act opens up dialog. Real dialog and not just the cheeky back and forth we've got going. </p>

<p>Lmao, oh you dont say? Maybe it's cause I end up in long threads like this one. Your short handed chart even says it's an incomplete picture. Youre reaching again bud. 
It doesn't even take into account that the other political reddit has had me banned for months now. </p>
<p>Your credibility on this one is just flat out fabricated. But I do like the tool. Might use it in the future for a few things myself. But definately not for stating definative facts like youre trying to pull. When your only proof even discredits itself you know you've messed up somewhere</p>

<p>&rt;Comrade, no potato for you. Stop trying to make people die from covid, hell is not a pleasant place for your soul to go to.</p>
<p>I've known at least 15 people to get covid and everyone said it felt like a cold and was gone in a couple of weeks. </p>
<p>Even the death percentage from covid as a population as a whole is miniscule. I cant stop people from dying from covid any more than I can stop people from dying from the flu. Which much like covid, only kills people with comorbidities and pre-existing conditions that make the susceptible to die from most viruses,diseases, and conditions.</p>
<p>And love, Hell is being here with you, and right now there's no place I'd rather be♡</p>
<p>...is it getting hot in here or is it just you?</p>

<p>This is literally you. Again, projecting. I'm not denying any truth or hiding it, I'm promoting a vaccine for a virus like we have done other times before. Covid will not go away if we believe hard enough that it will go away. Take your head out of the sand.</p>
<p>It's amazing how much projection you do. Like actually comical and it would be far more comical if it didn't have tangible repercussions.</p>
<p>Tell me, what legitimate book is denouncing the vaccine?  I link to things like studies from the AHA on covid effects but get downvoted so I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be reading here. What did you read that led you to this?</p>

<p>Is this a joke? You realize you can google covid death tracker and see for yourself that's untrue, right? Even if you think some states are lying you can look at states you trust.</p>
<p>It's okay, keep spreading lies in here. You all are only going to believe untrue things that affirm your world view anyways. Where somehow covid isnt bad but at the same time you want people executed for not using every treatment available, a world that is completley illogical.</p>

        <p>You know what, there is plenty of proof the politics influenced healthcare in respect to ivermectin.</p>
<p>Not that you deserve it, but if you look at the last 2 years ivermectin was shut down by governments.</p>
<p>India was already using ivermectin, that CDC Chief made them stop using ivermectin &amp; the deaths escalated therefore she is responsible for the spike &amp; the deaths as result.</p>
<p>I didn't just pluck this out of my arse. I got it from the news the picture is for people like you. Who talk a lot without proper sources.</p>

<p>I cant believe I need to prove that you cant be sued in a civil court with the death penalty as an option. Welcome to civics 101.</p>
<p>A lot of extraneous treatments were cut because some political nutjobs said that hydroxychloroquine was a good treatment that resulted in more deaths so they stuck to drugs they knew were effective. When you use a large cocktail at once it's hard to tell what was killing someone or not. It's why people who arent involved in healthcare shouldn't get to dictate things like masks (the cdc was forced by the White House to first say masks dont work, they clearly do), or treatments (again, the White House pushed hydroxychloroquine). </p>
<p>Being wrong about which one is an accident, but one that only happened due to political bullshit by covid deniers.</p>

        <p>Ah stop talking shite.. politics and medicine don't mix. They block ivermectin and used remdisivir.</p>
<p>Why do I need to repeat myself to you! The whole reason they surpressed ivermectin was for the jabs.. because it was knowledge prior to Vaccines.</p>
<p>They are still blocking ivermectin.. but now dumping remdisivir and now they are using new experimental drugs to treat both costing thousands and low availablity.</p>
<p>You are not very bright.. just nit picking. You are going after stupid things unrelated and unimportant..</p>
<p>The facts are if it doesn't suit their narrative they don't want it.</p>

<p>Researchers from Italy, UK &amp; Pakistan Identify Nutraceutical [Quercetin] as COVID-19 Crusher: More Trials Needed; TrialSite Staff; July 8, 2021;</p>
<p>￼</p>
<p>clinical trial</p>
<p>https://trialsitenews.com/researchers-from-italy-uk-pakistan-identify-nutraceutical-as-covid-19-crusher-more-trials-needed/?utm_source=pocket_mylist</p>
<p>This study was recently published in the peer-reviewed International Journal of General Medicine,</p>
<p>Quercetin is a plant flavanol from the flavonoid group polyphenols. This substance is found in many fruits, vegetables, leaves, seeds, and grains, and even red onions and kale. A bitter flavor, flavanol is used as an ingredient in dietary supplements, beverages, and foods.</p>
<p>Thanks to the TrialSite community member for sending in these impressive study results, albeit with some study design limitations. A randomized, prospective, open-label study of 152 COVID-19 outpatients, the study team treated the patients with a proprietary formulation of quercetin at a dosage of 1000mg/day for 30 days. The results showed a significant reduction in hospitalization, days hospitalized, need for supplemental oxygen, ICU, and mortality. The results also confirmed the very high safety profile of quercetin and suggested possible anti-fatigue and pro-appetite properties. This suggests there are symptomatic relief benefits as a justification to use quercetin as an adjuvant therapy while results from larger, better-designed RCTs are conducted.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the findings here align with a recently published meta-analysis of preclinical studies where the authors concluded that the preclinical use of quercetin, or polyphenols of the quercetin type, in animal models of viral respiratory infection is able to significantly reduce: the mortality rate, the viral load, the release of proinflammatory cytokines, the presence of reactive oxygen species, the production of mucus and, therefore, also the resistance of the airways. Supplementing with quercetin-type molecules could therefore be considered a promising strategy for the treatment of viral respiratory infections, reported the team led by corresponding author Francesco Di Pierro with Velleja Research, Milan, Italy.</p>

        <p>I actually lol'd. You couldn't find any example of hydroxychloroquine actually being beneficial so you listed the "study" that never actually got peer reviewed that shows a random supplement treats covid in non-hospitalized people. Here's an actual peer reviewed study with an appreciable size of patients who are actually ill. </p>
<p>&rt;  The enrollment of patients in the hydroxychloroquine group was closed on June 5, 2020, after an interim analysis determined that there was a lack of efficacy. Death within 28 days occurred in 421 patients (27.0%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and in 790 (25.0%) in the usual-care group (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.23; P = 0.15). Consistent results were seen in all prespecified subgroups of patients. The results suggest that <strong>patients in the hydroxychloroquine group were less likely to be discharged from the hospital alive within 28 days than those in the usual-care group (59.6% vs. 62.9%; rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.98)</strong>. Among the patients who were not undergoing mechanical ventilation at baseline, <strong>those in the hydroxychloroquine group had a higher frequency of invasive mechanical ventilation or death</strong> (30.7% vs. 26.9%; risk ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.27). There was a small numerical excess of cardiac deaths (0.4 percentage points) but no difference in the incidence of new major cardiac arrhythmia among the patients who received hydroxychloroquine.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33031652/</p>
<p>Peer reviewed as well. Trump doesn't mean shit. Hydroxychloroquine was pulled because it harmed patients and was part of the cocktail used so it tripped up doctors. Not sure how many ways I can explain this to you, especially when you keep responding with fringe things paid for by supplement companies and stuff. It's kinda silly</p>

        <p>So just so I get this right, you think that instead or taking the option to use antiviral/immunomodulating medications that are hugely expensive and make pharma companies a metric fuck ton of money (my step mom pays 14k annually for hers, hospitalized patients were often spending multiple thousands per treatment), you think they instead made a vaccine that is distributed for free to make money?  That makes zero sense on its face.</p>
<p>I mean... have you not heard the conspiracy theory on why HIV doesnt have a vaccine yet but instead immunomodulators? Because the pharma companies can charge infinitely more than a vaccine. If they wanted money it would make infinitely more sense to push a temporary treatment that is expensive than to push a free vaccine.</p>
<p>It makes zero sense to do what you are saying. None. Occams razor.</p>
