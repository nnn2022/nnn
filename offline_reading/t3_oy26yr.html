    <strong>My college has philosophical and religious exemption forms accepted for covid-19, but I do not know how to phrase my exemption where the form says to explain. How should I word it?</strong>
    <p><p>Specifically, the form asks “Explain in your own words why you are requesting this philosophical exemption including the principles that guide your objection to the COVID-19 vaccination”.
If I don’t get the vaccine, I have to do the exemption form. If I don’t do the exemption form, I have been warned I WILL be dis-enrolled.</p></p>

        <p>Familiarize yourself with the Nuremberg Code. </p>
<p>International law dictates that a person may not be coerced into taking part in scientific study for which benefit cannot be clearly articulated to outweigh risk.  Given that the risk profile associate with the vaccines is still evolving and given the the likelihood of death and injury in the 20-29 population is very small, the risk-benefit analysis is inconclusive at best.  That is, the personal risk benefit is still being studied - which makes you a test subject.  it is absolutely unethical and possibly a violation of international law to coerce you giving up your bodily autonomy for the sake of an experiment, no matter how widespread that experiment is. </p>
<p>While some people may argue that this is for the public good, the marginal benefit to society of your individual vaccination also cannot be adequately articulated and cannot be show to outweigh the risk to you individually (another violation of the Nuremberg Code).</p>
<p>However, if they are willing to confirm their willingness to pay for damages, including pain and suffering of $20,000,000 for any adverse effect, I'm sure you would be happy to consider the vaccine.</p>

        <p>If they allow a personal belief exemption then I don’t think they can tell you that your personal belief is wrong. I would just tell them that you don’t believe in a rush vaccine that doesn’t have long-term safety data. Or you can get a religious exemption. I’ll send you a link  to those details</p>

<p>Oh, how would you word it? I wouldn't know because he hasn't expressed any thoughts on the subject. </p>
<p>All I've read is what O/P posted. “Explain in your own words why you are requesting this philosophical exemption including the principles that guide your objection to the COVID-19 vaccination”.
He hasn't explained at all how he feels about it so I how can I help him put his thoughts into words? </p>
<p>What O/P is actually looking for is for someone to express thoughts that he can than use for his own purpose. In other words, someone to do his thinking. Show me I'm wrong.</p>

        <p>Here’s the thing: a philosophy doesn’t need to be excessively detailed. Most people on this sub have a similar philosophy, or distrust of the vaccine. Simply because they’re here is proof enough to say that they distrust the vaccine. The question clearly asks how to phrase a religious/philosophical exemption. The philosophy in this case, is (again) distrust. </p>
<p>Many people actually struggle with wording their thoughts in a manner that’s appropriate for work/school. This business style of writing isn’t used very much in day to day life, depending on one’s profession. Even if the thoughts are clear, organized, and well-thought over, it can be difficult to express it in “professional” language. </p>
<p>If you can’t derive an answer from what I just wrote, I suggest you read it again, and read between the lines.</p>

        <p>You typed a whole lotta words but you haven’t disputed my point. I don’t know if O/P “distrusts” the virus. I have no way of knowing how he feels about it based on his post. What he’s asked for is help to describe why he feels he should be exempt from a vaccine requirement without expressing why he feels that way.</p>

        <p>Not the virus, the vaccine. Nowhere in this post does it say anything about that. Not sure how you got that conclusion... </p>
<p>Anyway, my argument, in its most basic form, is that most people here share the same lack of trust in the vaccine and wish to verbalize it (as OP does). However, unless you type at a computer writing up fancy documents all day, chances are that “official” language isn’t necessarily something you use every day and therefore you need help, from like-minded people, to verbalize this opinion.</p>
<p>Also, despite feelings being quite nondescript over the internet, I think it’s a rudimentary inference at best to say that OP clearly feels as though they don’t want to take the vaccine, which heavily implies distrust.</p>
<p>Also, this is what I meant by “read between the lines.” Not everything has to be spelled out for you, I’m sure that you can make inferences from the information given.</p>

        <p>here is what I was going to say but I was told by many that a less passionate approach would be more effective , as well as other users saying it wasn’t even a philosophical answer like the prompt wanted. So stop your whining about not knowing my stance , which is going to basically the same as every other poster here, which isn’t even the topic at hand. I need to know the best way to phrase this so my school accepts it as a valid exemption reason, which my initial passionate rant was not. https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oocgbb/my_college_is_requiring_the_covid_vaccine_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</p>

        <p>Well I mean your rant makes sense, but I think to go straight to religion isn’t necessarily required. As long as you can smoothly pull off your philosophy in writing, they should accept it (I hope).</p>

        <p>It’s more a matter of wanting to know how to phrase it in a way that would be standard and accepted in what feels like a much more important and formal exemption form that will be notarized. I cannot just do some passionate rant or my exemption will be tossed for not being a good reason.</p>
