        <p>I didn’t ask if it would make a difference relatively speaking. Of course it would. Our hypothetical person is still destitute at the end of the day, just live the survival rate doesn’t want all this bullshit whether it increases by 0.1% or not.</p>

        <p>No I am serious. Yes, tiny numbers, but the amount of Covid cases worldwide is not tiny. I agree completely that it is not dangerous etc. but if let's say we have 1000 000 deaths and a vaccine would stop 33% that would still be 330 000 people. </p>
<p>Again, I am not even advocating for a vaccine, just saying that the argument is stupid. 99.7-99.8 is not a small difference is my point.</p>

        <p>It is a small difference. 330,000 people in the context of nearly 8billion is a rounding error. You can’t think in terms of raw numbers at this scale.</p>
<p>Keep in mind I disagree with the meme’s “does the vaccine work” rhetoric and think that kind of shit makes us look bad. I fully agree with the meme’s “are we supposed to give a shit when it was 99.7% survival to begin with” aspect.</p>

<p>“Our ICU unit runs at about 92% occupancy since we are the only level 1 trauma centre in the area. Very early on in our covid-19 response, we converted 2 ICU’s to negative pressure rooms.” </p>
<p>Tampa General Hospital, the one you sourced, are low on Intensive Care Units meaning that the one they have is 92% capacity in general. One hospital. And the 92% was before covid started. How do you think this is good enough evidence that ICU admissions aren’t declining? You sourced one hospital that has limited ICU departments. </p>

<p>Please vaccines work. They are not here to kill you or control you. The government and the people want covid over, and I promise you, we can all work together to make it happen. The vaccines have been clinically trialed and tested by the best scientists in the world who have spent their whole lives studying diseases and vaccines.</p>

        <p>I have read the source. Yes, it was 92% before. As I've said, ICUs regularly run hot. Talking about ICU capacity is irrelevant.</p>
<p>There's fewer admissions because the WuFlu is a seasonal virus. We saw this in 2020 where the entire summer was negligible, then a spike in the fall.</p>
<p>Like the flu.</p>
<p>Like the cold.</p>
<p>The WuFlu isn't a problem. It never has been.</p>
<p>&rt;The government and the people want covid over,</p>

<p>No. I will never work with a government that denies basic human rights and makes normal life illegal.</p>

<p><em>You</em> were the one who brought up the 92% ICU capacity with a source? </p>

<p>Then why is it this time last year the number of deaths in the US were more than double what it is this year? </p>
<p>May 5th 2020 had a 7 day average of 1,818 deaths per day in USA. </p>
<p>May 6th 2021 had a 7 day average of 623 deaths per day in USA. </p>
<p>Scroll down to reported deaths by day:

<p>And that’s with only 45% of the population having 1 dose of the vaccine. </p>

<p>&rt;Then why is it this time last year the number of deaths in the US were more than double what it is this year? </p>
<p>Because deaths aren't properly reported.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kmov.com/news/colorado-coroner-calling-out-how-state-classifies-covid-19-deaths/article_297e3550-4131-11eb-9f01-ffe3e11d0f46.html">The Grand County, Colorado coroner is calling attention to the way the state health department is classifying some deaths. The coroner, Brenda Bock, says two of their five deaths related to COVID-19 were people who died of gunshot wounds.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/feds-classify-all-coronavirus-patient-deaths-as-covid-19-deaths/">“The intent is … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that,” she added.</a></p>
<p>Even in Canada.</p>
<p><a href="https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown">https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown</a></p>
<p>&rt; The daily pandemic death counts in Ontario include people who have  tested positive for COVID-19 but have not necessarily died from the  virus.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The exact number of people who fit into this category is unknown by the government and not even being counted.</p>
<p>&rt;“The mortality data sent to the Ministry and reported in (Ottawa  Public Health) dashboard/reports represents the number of Ottawa  residents with confirmed COVID-19 who have passed away,” an Ottawa  Public Health spokesperson explained via email. “It does not indicate if  COVID-19 was the cause of death, and we can’t make that inference.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;According to local health units, this reporting process is required by the province.</p>
<p>You don't need to have died from the WuFlu to be reported as a WuFlu death. In fact, all you need to do is die with a cough and you'll be reported as a WuFlu death. </p>
<p>The deathcount is meaningless due to bad reporting.</p>
<p>The cases count is meaningless due to the PCR test failures.</p>
<p>None of this improvement is from vaccines.</p>

        <p>YOU were the one who gave me the link about the ICU units. I then showed you that the link you gave was bullshit because tampa general hospital (the hospital in the link you gave me) had high ICU admissions because they didn’t have many intensive care units. </p>
<p>The first link you gave me isn’t available in my country. </p>
<p>The second link says: </p>
<p>“The mortality data sent to the ministry... represents the number of Ottawa residents with confirmed covid-19 who have passed away... it does not indicate if covid-19 was the cause of death” </p>
<p>So the people who died DID HAVE covid when they died, they just weren’t sure if covid was a direct cause of death. I’ll leave it to the doctors who know more about that than you and me put together to write the cause of death. </p>
<p>No tests are 100% reliable it doesn’t mean you can discredit every positive test. </p>
<p>You’ve also chosen to ignore the links I’ve shown you about ICU admissions, deaths and cases falling. And I’ve disproved every one of your arguments.</p>

        <p>YOU were the one who gave me a link about the ICU unit and I showed you that the link was bullshit. I never said that ICU capacity proved vaccines work. I said the reason that specific hospital (that you linked) had high ICU admission was because it didn’t have many Intensive care units. You were trying to say vaccines didn’t reduce ICU admissions and I gave you sources as to how they were which you decided to ignore. Look I don’t mean this in a bad way but I’m not sure if you can’t keep up with the conversation or if you’re trying to turn this back round to me by saying I started talking about ICU units? You gave me the link first about it. </p>
<p>The first link you gave me is unavailable in my country. </p>
<p>About the 2nd link you gave me: </p>
<p>“Ontario death count includes people who didn’t die of covid, but exactly how many is unknown.” </p>
<p>So according to that you don’t know how many deaths weren’t covid related. Even if deaths weren’t covid related, the data (that I gave you) has shown a significant decrease over a 7 day average month after month from this time last year to present time. That’s not a coincidence. The decrease shows that vaccines work. I’ve gave you links to vaccines working in USA, UK, ICU units and you’ve chose to ignore them all.</p>

        <p>I come in peace as a person who is definitely going to take the vaccine ASAP. I appreciate that some of you have a different view to me of the risks / effectiveness of the vaccine (and the seriousness of Covid), but I think we should be clear on what a successful outcome for the vaccine looks like (so that we can properly judge what’s at stake in the decision to accept or reject it).</p>
<p>I’m no medical expert but doesn’t this image look like an obvious red herring? A key purpose of the vaccine is surely to decrease transmission rates (which is why there is discussion is about “herd immunity” and about getting vaccination rates high enough to achieve it). Even if survival rates didn’t decrease at all (and they should), a large reduction of transmission would be a major win and would suggest the vaccine is working (especially if transmission remains low despite a return to the “old normal”).</p>
<p>Besides, talk of survival rates ignores the long term impacts of Covid, which are not yet known.</p>

        <p>There's no long term effects of the WuFlu. At least nothing new.</p>
<p>https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326619</p>
<p>Post viral syndrome is a well known effect of getting sick. You always recover. </p>
<p>There's no issue with transmission rates as this is a non deadly virus. The H1N1 pandemic infected 60.8 million Americans alone. Yet due to the sitting president no masks, no deadly lockdowns, no media campaign, no misreporting.</p>
<p><a href="https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/feds-classify-all-coronavirus-patient-deaths-as-covid-19-deaths/">“The intent is … if someone dies with COVID-19, we are counting that,” she added.</a></p>

The coroner, Brenda Bock, says two of their five deaths related to COVID-19 were people who died of gunshot wounds.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown">https://torontosun.com/news/provincial/ontario-death-count-includes-people-who-didnt-die-of-covid-19-but-exactly-how-many-is-unknown</a></p>
<p>&rt; The daily pandemic death counts in Ontario include people who have  tested positive for COVID-19 but have not necessarily died from the  virus.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The exact number of people who fit into this category is unknown by the government and not even being counted.</p>
<p>&rt;“The mortality data sent to the Ministry and reported in (Ottawa  Public Health) dashboard/reports represents the number of Ottawa  residents with confirmed COVID-19 who have passed away,” an Ottawa  Public Health spokesperson explained via email. “It does not indicate if  COVID-19 was the cause of death, and we can’t make that inference.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;According to local health units, this reporting process is required by the province.</p>
<p>The WuFlu isn't deadly. It likely isn't even contagious. Ignoring the fact PCR tests are wrong more often than not, we can look at the fact that this is meant to be an exponential growth virus. These aren't my words.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/exponential-growth-what-it-is-why-it-matters-and-how-to-spot-it/">Our second way of understanding exponential growth is to think of doubling times.  From that 22%, I calculate a doubling time of 2.7 days, so I’ve highlighted in bold, every third day in the table.  Decide for yourself: is the number of cases roughly doubling between each highlighted row?  The “exponential growth” way of looking at this data is not exactly right, but in my view it’s not far wrong.</a></p>
<p>Forbes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/03/17/why-exponential-growth-is-so-scary-for-the-covid-19-coronavirus/?sh=4ddb126e4e9b">the exponential nature of the infection transmission isn’t stemmed in any way, there will be 1024 infected people on January 31: about a thousand times as many as you began with. That’s a lot, but remember that this continues to double every three days as long as this growth remains exponential. On February 3, there will be twice as many: 2048 infected. On February 6, that rises to 4096. By the time you get to March 19, which is 78 days after the initial infection, some 67 million people will be infected.</a></p>
<p>Washington Post.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2020/03/27/what-does-exponential-growth-mean-context-covid-19/">For coronavirus infections, the doubling time in the United States has been about 2½ days. That means that, on average, the number of reported covid-19 cases doubles every 2½ days. </a></p>
<p>USA today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2020/03/28/coronavirus-cases-growing-rapidly-exponential-growth/2922091001/">For COVID-19, that number is likely higher than two, according to Melissa Nolan, an infectious disease expert and professor at the University of South Carolina. One sick person quickly becomes two; two becomes four; four becomes eight. Graph it on a chart, and the line quickly skyrockets upward.</a></p>
<p>However this virus was found in September 2019.</p>
<p>https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2020-11-17/COVID-19-was-spreading-in-Italy-by-September-2019-study-indicates-VuSqUttP8s/index.html</p>
<p>That's 7 months of unmitigated exponential growth. </p>
<p>At the rates above, there would have been over 100 <em>billion</em> cases. More than every human that's ever lived. </p>
<p>If reinfection was a thing, we likely wouldn't see a single healthy person today. </p>
<p>So no. This isn't a deadly virus. This isn't a contagious virus. I will not take the shot, and I will not recommend anyone to take the shot.</p>

        <p>Have to take a little time to process all that but quick question, since I suspect you’ve thought of this: isn’t the view of “unmitigated exponential growth” affected by the fact that we did mitigate (lock downs, social distancing etc). One of the stated purposes of those measures was to end exponential growth.</p>

<p>No. Because as I cited above, the virus was around for 7 months before the mitigations. In that 7 months where this didn't even make the news, where the only people talking about it was Alex Jones, there would have been 100 billion cases.</p>

        <p>Thank you, I think its fair to say that discussions on this are generally uncivil, which is pointless and unpleasant.</p>
<p>I’m probably not at risk myself. While I don’t mean this as a knock on anyone else, my primary reason for accepting the vaccine is to be a part of the solution and a return to the “old normal” (fully appreciating that some will not believe the vaccine can achieve those things). I consider it a civic duty.</p>

<p>We don't know the long term effects of the vaccine or covid.  Therefore, before inflicting all humanity with either, it's best we make sure there's a pretty even split just in case either is worse than we think.</p>
<p>If we inflict the vaccine on all humanity and something goes wrong that's unaccounted for, even accidentally with the best intentions, all humanity now will suffer it's effects.</p>
<p>This is why so many emphasize it's experimental nature.</p>

        <p>I’m afraid I don’t see a flaw in the logic. Covid is a disease that doesn’t give a shit what it does to us. On the other hand, the vaccine is specifically designed to not have long-term effects. </p>
<p>In short, there’s a clear difference between a disease, and the vaccine against that disease.</p>
<p>Calling something a “poison” doesn’t help at all. Water is a poison, if you drink too much of it. The vaccine is specifically designed to not poison you.</p>

        <p>The claim that COVID-19 killed around 600k americans is a lie that is constantly being used to get people to comply to more and more fascism/totalitarianism being imposed. </p>
<p>The ICD-10 classification for COVID-19 deaths does not require a confirmation that COVID-19 was the cause of death.</p>
<p>The 600K figure <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm">comes from the CDC</a> which states this:</p>
<p>&rt; All Deaths Involving COVID-19 [1]</p>
<p>&rt; [1] Deaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1.</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">report regarding that new ICD-10 U07.1 classification</a> also states that confirmation <strong>is not required</strong>:</p>
<p>&rt; What happens if the terms reported on the death certificate indicate uncertainty?</p>
<p>&rt; - If the death certificate reports terms such as “probable COVID-19” or “likely COVID-19,” these terms would be assigned the new ICD code. It Is not likely that NCHS will follow up on these cases.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt;Should “COVID-19” be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?</p>
<p>&rt; - COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or <strong>is assumed to have caused or contributed to death</strong>.</p>
<p>People have died from the same things that they've always died from: cancer, heart disease, diabetes, pneumonia, obesity, medical errors, all kinds of diseases, old age, flu, accidents, etc.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moreover, having <strong>a positive PCR test is not indicative of being infected with a virus</strong>:</p>
<p>Who knows more about the PCR tests than it's inventor? Kary Mullis: "With PCR, if you do it well you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V__Zx0qS7uI&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=%2a%2aBirgit%2a%2a">find almost anything in anybody</a>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Study from november 2020: <a href="http://philosophers-stone.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/The-scam-has-been-confirmed-Dsalud-November-2020.pdf">PCR does not detect SARS-CoV-2 </a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>A group of australian lawyers have sent an open letter to their government: "This is no pandemic, <a href="https://concernedlawyersnetwork.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6.11.20-CLN-TO-GOVTS-LETTER.pdf">Covid19 tests are unreliable to test any specific disease"</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the false positive rate is <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1297711784044957699">100%</a></strong>. It depends on the lab because each lab uses a different number of amplification cycles for the PCR. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Portuguese court has ruled that <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">the PCR tests are unreliable and that it is unlawful to quarantine people based solely on a PCR test</a>, and that "the probability that said person is infected is less than 3%, and the probability that said result is a false positive is <strong>97%</strong>". Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>International experts suggest that <a href="https://westphaliantimes.com/international-experts-suggest-that-up-to-90-of-canadian-covid-cases-could-be-false-positives/">up to 90% COVID cases could be false positives</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>Former chief science officer for Pfizer says <a href="https://discover.hubpages.com/politics/Pfizer-Chief-Science-Officer-Second-Wave-Based-on-Fake-Data-of-False-Positives-for-New-Cases-Pandemic-is-Over">"second wave" is faked on false-positive COVID tests</a>. Ignored by the MSM.</p>
<p>TPTB are well aware that the PCR tests are not picking up what they should be picking up, so they need us to use them for testing as long as possible in order for these tests to inflate the numbers world-wide. These numbers are then used to "justify" the imposing of NWO restrictions which are meant to transform society as we know it.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is 95% effective. So the "survival" rate should go from 99.7% to 99.985%. I say "survival" because it's hard to say how many people would have gotten the disease had a vaccine not be developed.</p>
<p>To put in perspective, it is being claimed that 600k Americans have died from covid. If the data is correct then that toll would have been reduced to 30k had we had the vaccine and it be administered at the beginning of the pandemic. It actually would be near 0 because the idea of a vaccine is that people cannot spread it so likely there wouldn't have been 30K infections.</p>

Gene therapy implies the use of DNA which stays in the body and can be incorporated into chromosomes.  The RNA in the vaccines wouldn’t be converted into DNA because the enzymes capable of doing that aren’t present. Also, the RNA is not stable enough and is rapidly degraded. Training the immune system to develop antibodies that identify a specific protein does not make it gene therapy.</p>

        <p>You're going into different territory than what the post is about. I agree with what you said, but it is kind of irrelevant to the question of "how do we know if it is working". I think the efficacy of it in low impact countries prior to vaccination is clear: it's not working.</p>

        <p>Exactly. I have several loved ones who have gotten the shot/want to get it to protect their families or people that they work with... I thought it was just to prevent you from getting it/reducing your symptoms, not slow the spread? If that’s the case, if someone is not worried about getting covid and the shot only protects them, how are they “selfish” for not wanting it?</p>

        <p>The “mitigation strategies” haven’t done much to alter the course of the virus. The lockdowns didn’t really slow anything down, 6 foot social distancing is nowhere near enough, and masks do little to prevent spread of infection. This virus just isn’t that big of a deal</p>

        <p>so, imagine this.<br>
you invent a "problem", but the problem.. is a non problem.<br>
now you need to invent a "solution".. but you have a problem yourself- nobody is going to pay you for your solution, if the problem isn't that bad.  </p>
<p>so you SAY there's a problem, mess with data, pay people to lie, etc etc to make people believe, there truly is a problem.<br>
then you start by giving them PART of a "solution"  </p>
<p>now. remember, there wasn't really much of a "problem" at all. but now, theres part of a "solution".  </p>
<p>so people start questioning the problem. is it REALLY a problem? what about the data that shows its not?<br>
"oh, that's because of *part of solution* that we gave you!"<br>
then they tell you how you'll know *when* the final part of the "solution" has worked.<br>
while simultaneously telling you it doesn't. but you should do it anyways- just to be 'safe'.  </p>
<p>you create fear. you create a problem. you create a solution. you gain money and power.<br>
too many people question it, they get silenced.  </p>
<p>it is literally right out in the open, but people are too easily fooled.</p>

        <p>&rt;imagine this.</p>
<p>That's the key isn't it? What you've described is imaginary.</p>
<ul>
<li>There really is a pandemic going on. </li>
<li>The spread of any coronavirus can really be slowed by practicing respiratory protection and hand hygiene.</li>
<li>We really can improve survival rates by providing medical treatment to sufferers.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's okay to be stressed: this is a stressful time for billions of people. But there's no need for elaborate fantasies like the one you've described. All this nonsense could be quite harmful for your mental health.</p>
<p>Take care of yourself.</p>

        <p>I appreciate your concern for my wellbeing.  </p>
<p>"imagine this" is simply a way for me to delve into an analogy. <br>
a representation, that while in of itself is not real- is describing reality.<br>
replace problem with covid.<br>
replace solution with masks, lockdowns, experimental vaccines.  </p>
<p>if you base your information on provably incorrect data, your result will always be incorrect.  </p>
<p>you know what's bad for mental health?<br>
constant fearmongering. making people attack and argue against eachother.<br>
this isn't the first time in history this sort of thing has happened.  </p>
<p>"divide and conquer"<br>
such an elegant, beautiful quote. says so much with so little.<br>
the difference between way back then, and now</p>
<p>is how much more effectively they can do this. <br>
they have the tech. the power. the research. the money. the media.  </p>
<p>they are literally dividing the people.<br>
conspiracies are becoming less and less outlandish by the day.  </p>
<p>the world looks more and more like the book "1984" the further this nonsense ensues.  </p>
<p>this subreddit exists because freedom of speech, and personal freedoms, are important to humanity.  </p>
<p>this covid nonsense is a literal path to authoritarian fascism.  </p>
<p>you know it's bad when there's other people petitioning to remove this subreddit [remember, this sub exists for human rights and freedoms]  </p>
<p>r/NoNewNormalBan exists. that in itself is a clear sign that truth is being censored about this covid nonsense.  </p>
<p>believe what you want to believe. I just wish you'd think critically, and stop arguing with people who are trying to protect human rights.  </p>
<p>but hey- freedom of choice. so you do you.  </p>
<p>PS: my mental healths okay.</p>
