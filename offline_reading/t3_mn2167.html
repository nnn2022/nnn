    <strong>Subreddit growing... how do you talk to those around you?</strong>
    <p><p>hi guys, when i joined this sub last month it had around 47,000 folks on it and now we’re at 54,000. it reassures me to see almost 2,000 other people on this page when i’m looking. i’ve always identified as very left, and the past month have done a lot of my own research with the help of VPN and duckduckgo. i’ve been skeptical of these lockdowns since december and met with concerned looks when i brought up my concerns to my friends. </p>
<p>now, i’ve gone down the rabbit hole a lot further. in university, i’m studying biology and have been doing a lot of research in the library and through databases. i’ve brought up my concerns about these mRNA injections and government propaganda to a select close friends, and am happy that they listen and are willing to have discussions with me, even if they disagree. </p>
<p>it alarms me how many people i know want more restrictions. where i live, people are driving around with masks, wearing masks on walks outside when no one’s around, etc. people everywhere have bought into the fear mongering and it’s hard not being able to talk to friends and acquaintances i care about without fear they’re going to think i’ve gone to the far right or something. </p>
<p>i love humanity. humans are stupid, but i love humanity. i love people. i miss little moments with strangers. i cherish the interactions i have now. i’m really discouraged by how many people i know “can’t wait for the vaccine” but have no idea how it works or that nothing like this has been used for vaccination before. i worry the most about ADE (antibody dependency enhancement). i worry that people are fine with staying in their homes forever. </p>
<p>would love to hear how you all are coping with this. if anyone who completely disagrees with everything i’ve said has anything to chim in, i’d love to hear from you too. it’s hard knowing people would consider me an “anti- vaxxer” now just because i have concerns about injecting the majority of the world with a brand new class of vaccine. ahhhh. rant over!</p></p>

        <p>I don't discuss any of this with anyone who disagrees with me. There's no point. It's too late to single handedly deprogram a victim of 13 months of 24/7 brainwashing.</p>

        <p>definitely understand that, i’m new to this and already it’s a lot of energy. that being said, if you do have the energy, i think you can still get through to some people. maybe plant the seed for them to investigate themselves. again, i was totally succumb to the brainwashing until pretty recently, and am really grateful now that i stumbled upon something that made me look into all this. that being said, i’m glad more and more people are joining this sub every day. people are waking up, i like to think.</p>

        <p>Hey you sound a bit like me! What upsets me most about this whole thing is that we are not allowed to have human connection, which I thrive on. I also feel devastated by what feels like the loss of human spirit, arts and culture. I'm also on the left and worry about people's perceptions of me as anti science or whatever. Being queer is basically equivalent to pro lockdown at this point (although there must be others who are silently skeptical, it just feels really lonely sometimes). I would feel a lot better finding or talking to people locally about it. I don't even know how to go about finding those people. I live in a very conforming, "save lives" kind of place. I don't really have anyone I can talk to except my mom who knew what was up before this even started lol. </p>
<p>So... I don't know how to talk to those around me. As we get closer to vaccinations here, I am going to "come out" as a skeptic to some of my close friends and at least have discussions with them about it. I think for me it has to do with the final push to stop worrying about what anyone else thinks of me. I am also working on my emotional resilience around what's happening, so that when people challenge me about the vaccine in the future, I'll be able to react calmly and just say my piece. How can people argue with rational, calm behaviour? (They still will, but maybe harder to dismiss as crazy)</p>

        <p>hey, reading your comment i was like damn yes the arts is one thing that i’m personally missing so much, and connecting with people at weekly shows... and then you said about being queer and i was like tHIS!!! nail on the head!!! i’m queer too and i totally agree with you in that it does feel like just because i identify as queer that automatically assumes i must think X, Y, and Z too. </p>
<p>i’m really glad you have your mom. i moved back in with my immediate family recently and am so eternally grateful that we’re on the same page about how the pandemic is being handled. emotional resilience is so important and i’m working on mine too. it’s hard not to feel emotional when you get the feeling people you’re close with (friends, etc.) are judging you for expressing any kind of concerns about what’s going on. </p>

        <p>totally. and i feel like it’s been made to seem like it is, like “you’re questioning mask mandates, so you must be a right-wing conservative”. oh you’re on the left? then you want more lockdowns of course. </p>
<p>left, right, none of them really mean anything. all to divide us. like voting conservative means you’re a bigoted racist? voting left means you want communism? i really feel like it’s all to divide us further. those in office give us the illusion of democracy, but for the most part it’s all the same bullshit. this is rambly but hope i’m making sense. totally agree.</p>

        <p>I dont hate the left. I think they're just misinformed. I was a good little commie in high school and college. I thought I was the smartest guy in the world. Hand me the reigns and I'll fix everything.</p>
<p>I was fucking retarded. But I wasn't a bad guy. I approach people with that mindset. First step is to have them see that the powers pulling the strings of our government are not good people, and don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. Then it's a lot easier to get my points across.</p>

        <p>haha, yeah, personally i’ve never felt remotely close to the smartest guy, but i am really glad i’ve had this “awakening” so to speak in the past month. i think many on all sides are misinformed. i like your take on that, people who have some whack opinions they believe/have been fed can still be good people. for me all it took was one video that made me open my eyes and go what the fuck is going on (it was about edward snowden). i’m glad you’re having success getting across to people, and continuing to have conversations even when they’re tough. thanks for commenting :)</p>

<p>have you been having them say many things at work? do you just kind of nod along or not really say anything? at school i’m trying to figure out what to say. i usually just say “i don’t know” and trail off when people talk about how good it is we’re locking down more and stuff. sendin u love buddy!</p>

        <p>I totally feel you with the loving humanity thing. I love people and sometimes I can’t stand them. Overall I feel really bad that people are living in so much fear. That most people have abandoned critical thinking altogether and are perfectly fine with getting their information from main stream propaganda. I’ve never been this way and I can see that they’ve been brainwashed. I’m grateful that I have my husband who saw through all of this from the very beginning. Today I went for a walk in the woods and it was great to be in nature by myself. Nature is as perfect and sane as it gets. That certainly helps me cope.</p>

        <p>yeah, i feel really bad too. it’s so hard to see some of my closest friends literally terrified, going around with multiple masks, not wanting to even be around others outside. it makes me sad for them and selfishly wish they could see that it isn’t any serious risk to them so we could go back to seeing each other and what not. </p>
<p>i can’t stand the propaganda, i only realized a friggin month ago and now i’m like, how have i not seen this before? the weather channel is even political. WHO and CDC ads everywhere. it’s nuts. </p>
<p>i’m really glad you have your husband to connect with and be able to talk about these things. where i live the snow is almost gone, and i’m really excited about the weather. went for a small walk today, and where i’m living right now (back home with my family, moved in about 3 weeks ago temporarily because i was having a hard time alone and felt like i was losing my sanity) is surrounded by woods. i’m grateful for nature and going to prioritize being outside more. thanks for commenting :) hope you and your husband are well ♥️</p>

        <p>Do you think natural immunity would lead to ADE too? Like with dengue?</p>

        <p>I don't cheerlead, even my own pov. I find most "important" discussions boring because almost no one is open to changing their views, they just want confirmation of their own.</p>

        <p>if you question the vaccine you ARE an anti-vaxxer. it's literally the definition of "don't trust it so not going to take it" or "why treat myself for something i dont have". you just gotta realize that the base beneath you has moved without you and if you don't keep up, you'll fall right off. either your really truly believe everything they say or you become the people they hate</p>

        <p>to give someone an 'anti' stance is a good way to create political enemies.</p>
<p>questioning something's efficacy or a company's reliability is not really being 'anti'. it should actually be supported by the scientific community. but here we are.</p>
