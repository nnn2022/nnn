        <p>I don’t disagree with anything you say but the elites also fight amongst themselves. The bible isn’t as long ago as they say, well the earth is old and I ain’t religious at all but I’d be a fool to not believe in good and evil. Evil only wins when you allow it to. I believe in people being possessed by evil and be blind sighted and only they can change themselves. Free will and determination was seen as a curse by the devil as he didn’t understand why god let bad things happen to his own children. I’d say without free will and determination then every human would of had the jab by now, it would be game over. We all create our own mirco universal truths, we get shit tested along the way and our reactions determine the final outcome. Sorry for the religious over tones and preaching nature of what I put. It’s merely my option and I don’t acti others unless they try to take away mine or another persons free will.</p>
