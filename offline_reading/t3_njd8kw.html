        <p>Posting because I’m tired of seeing the discussion and ideas here reduced to fringe conspiracy theories and anti-science rhetoric elsewhere:</p>
<p>Man. It must be a lot easier to consider your ideological opponents as idiots instead of actually giving their ideas the time of day. Debate as a fundamental tenant of free speech? I never.</p>
<p>I regularly view that sub. I’m university educated. And I believe in vaccines. I’m vaccinated for all sorts of shit because the risk assessment <em>made sense</em>.</p>
<p>What I don’t believe in is the straw man fallacy of comparing these vaccines to those that we have decades of research on.</p>
<p>What I don’t believe in is authoritarian measures enforced on people, not for their safety, but for the functioning of an economy to serve the wealthy.</p>
<p>I am no longer becoming a teacher because this pandemic has shown me that teachers are at the forefront for enduring political stupidity.</p>
<p>The goal posts have moved so much in the last year. 2 weeks to well over a year. Masks beyond the point of usefulness. Vaccinate the old and weak, to vaccinate everyone or you’re a terrible person.</p>
<p>I get that my philosophy terrifies you because I’m motivated more out of self-interest than the collective, especially when the net benefit is highly questionable. Yours terrifies me just as much. You’re primed for authoritarianism. You use a base understanding of science to criticize and reject <em>debate and ideas</em>. You use this situation to justify your extreme morals, and thrive off the satisfaction of ‘being better than those uncooperative anti-science people’.</p>
<p>You made asking questions anti-science. And you’re so wrapped up in your own world view that even if I gave you sources <em>that absolutely justify my concern</em> you would dig your heels in. It is easier for you to accept that you’re right for obeying all these senseless restrictions and recommendations, than it is to consider that you might have wasted a year acting like the neighborhood cop for the government and wealthy elite who, evidently, do not give a fuck about you.</p>
<p>This was never about normalcy. This is about concern for growing governmental authority, and the agency with which science is used to green light terrible government policy, backed by a population that, like you, wants easy answers, and will ‘sacrifice some rights and privileges for the greater good if it means getting back to normal’. Yeah. You’ve seen those peer reviewed reports on Reddit that demonstrate governments have used the pandemic to grab power, but that creates cognitive dissonance with your obedience, so you DONT THINK ABOUT IT.</p>

        <p>Question, how can see you all the fuckery from the CDC and FDA and not realize they have been doing this for decades? Germ theory is bogus and is meant to sell us auto-immunity via injection. Please post one study where they have experimentally shown that one human can pass a disease to another.</p>

        <p>Congrats. You just demonstrated that we don’t know everything there is to know about viruses. This isn’t new. While you’re deciding on what to do with that evidence, how about a literal photograph of a virus, taken by electron microscope? https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-what-the-covid-19-virus-looks-like-under-electron-microscopes</p>
<p>I’m with the OP of this thread. Fellow science major, fully vaccinated with regard to vaccines that have existed for years with plenty of evidence supporting them, tired of the brainwashing, etc. I will freely admit that we don’t know everything there is to know about germs, but we certainly know that they exist.</p>

        <p>Taking a picture of a protein studded vesicle does not equal proving "viruses' are pathogenic. </p>
<p>This is how they discovered "SARS-COV-2" by assembling RNA fragments from samples with multiple sources of genetic material using an algorithm.</p>
<p>&rt;RNA extracted from <strong>bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid</strong> and <strong>culture supernatants</strong> was used as a template to clone and sequence the genome. We used a combination of Illumina sequencing and nanopore sequencing to characterize the virus genome. Sequence reads were <strong>assembled</strong> into contig maps (a set of overlapping DNA segments) <strong>with the use of CLC Genomics software</strong>, version 4.6.1 (CLC Bio). Specific primers were subsequently designed.</p>

        <p>Maybe you can point out if I'm missing something but this is all I got from that link.</p>
<p>&rt;Fears of possible human-to-human
transmission of avian influenza
strain H5N1 were confirmed on Feb 2
by the head of WHO’s global influenza
programme, Klaus Stöhr.
Stöhr told journalists at a press
conference that WHO had identified
two cases of avian influenza in women
who had not been directly exposed to
infected poultry.
The two women, one the new bride
of a Vietnamese man who died of the
disease, and the other his sister, were
thought to have been infected as they
cared for the sick man, who probably
contracted the virus on Jan 4, after
killing a duck for his wedding feast. He
also had another sister who is thought
to have developed the disease after
preparing the duck for the meal. 
The man and both his sisters are now
dead, but the bride developed a less
severe form of the disease and has since
recovered.
Stöhr said that although these cases
are the first suspected examples of
human-to-human transmission, it is
unlikely that the disease has spread
outside the family because no other
infected people have come forward.
Furthermore, drawing parallels with the
1997 outbreak of avian influenza in
Hong Kong, he said that even if
transmission between human beings
does happen, it is likely that such cases
will be rare and self-limiting. There
were several reports of human
transmission in the 1997 outbreak, but
people infected by other people tended
to have less severe symptoms, so the
chain of infection was short. 
A major concern for WHO now,
according to Stöhr, is that increased
spread of the disease among poultry
increases the chance that it will infect a
person who harbours a human form of
the influenza virus. A marriage of the
two viruses could produce a hybrid with
higher infectivity and pathogenicity. 
The UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) commented in a
statement that curbing disease spread
among poultry should be a top priority
for Asian governments. At a joint
WHO/FAO emergency meeting in
Rome on Feb 3, veterinary experts 
from 14 countries will discuss new
strategies for controlling the disease and
develop action plans for addressing
public-health concerns in affected
countries.</p>
<p>No experiment in there.</p>

        <p>You know why the risk assessment made sense before? Because you didn't look into it. Because your parents told you "time for your measles vaccine". Because everyone else gets one. Because everyone trusts that they're safe, even though none of us have actually read up on any of the studies, or searched up anecdotes of negative vaccination experiences, or tried to think up reasons that it could be bad.</p>
<p>I can guarantee that not a single person in this subreddit (perhaps excluding antivaxxers) looked up the ingredients in the vaccines they got before, or researched how long they'd been under development, or read any studies on their effectiveness. The "risk assessment" you did was just trusting that people say the vaccine prevents this illness, and you didn't want the illness, so you took the vaccine. And I say "risk assessment", but I don't mean to mock it - that's a perfectly logical approach. You aren't a scientist or a doctor, let alone one performing vaccine research - you have no hope of understanding the actual studies and coming to an informed conclusion on your own, so it makes perfect sense to trust experts. </p>
<p>But here we have a politicized issue. Suddenly you don't have to seek out concerns about a vaccine, they're thrust upon you. It's staggeringly easy to find good-sounding reasons to not take the vaccine, because people are writing up convincing posts that make it seem perfectly logical to not take it. But the reality is that there's no meaningful difference between this vaccine and other vaccines. You could come up with the same concerns for any vaccine, you could write up posts that are just as seductively discouraging if you wanted to. But luckily you didn't think to look for that kind of thing before taking the other vaccines. Unfortunately, you didn't have to look for it with this one.</p>

        <p>While you’re making a good point, it’s a lot easier to make risk assessment decisions when the risk is that high. Humanity suffered long and hard until the advent of vaccines. They are literally miracles. People would walk around with sores on their face and die at 30 from everything from measles to polio to malaria. Seriously. Malaria has killed more people than all the human wars combined, <em>ever</em>.</p>
<p>Science got us out of that hole, and I think that’s pretty cool. So for me, it’s a measure of these diseases that prevented mankind from the intellectual revolutions we’ve experience over the last century and a bit. And that makes it pretty easy.</p>
<p>Not to mention, again. Decades of long term research and improvement. Covid is no where near as lethal or debilitating as any of the aforementioned diseases, so it’s a bit apples and oranges IMO.</p>

        <p>Totally. But like, what are the odds of getting measles or polio right now? Like yeah, it'd be bad if you did, but everyone else is vaccinated so probably you won't get it. Of course, if even a small percentage of the population thought like that suddenly things would start not working out for them, but eh.</p>
<p>Covid may not be as debilitating in most cases, but that's small consolation to the millions of people who've lost family to it over the past year. Plus this is a new disease, we don't know what the long term effects will be. If the short term effects are more dangerous than the short term effects of the vaccine, why should we believe that the long terms effects won't also be worse?</p>

        <p>Exactly - that's why I'm vaccinated. And guess what, I'm not going to "but eh" the disease that's killed 3.5 million people, has unknown long-term side effects, and has thrown us into a hellscape of a world where everyone's lives have been fucked with for over a year now.</p>
<p>We can wait longer, sure. We can hold back the vaccines, we can keep letting people die of Covid, we can keep letting small businesses go bankrupt, we can keep driving the population mad. Maybe the vaccines are more dangerous than this, we don't really know. But we won't really know after 2 years. Or 3. Or 4, 5, 6. We just gain a little more security every year, but never 100%. Who knows if people just drop dead 40 years after vaccination. </p>
<p>Testing's been as extensive as it can be. Countries from all over the world have developed vaccines. They've been tested on humans and animals. For the short term, we know they're safe. We've also developed the vaccines and studied them - there's no reason to believe that there's anything dangerous in the vaccines. The key technology, mRNA, has been under development and testing since 1978. Finally, to further combat the fear of long-term side effects, we're already talking about needing booster shots in 6 months - the vaccine doesn't seem to be particularly good at lingering in our systems, so I'm not too afraid of it causing issues years down the road.</p>
<p>There's no way to be certain, but that's life. For me, all the evidence points to Covid vaccines being safe enough to warrant taking. I wouldn't take it just for fun - if Covid was restricted to a few cases in Africa like ebola or something, I'd never take the vaccine. But given the situation here, the threat of long-term side effects from a vaccine seems considerable less concerning than that same threat from contracting Covid.</p>

        <p>Also, you do realize that if 3.5 million is the bar for which you’ll go take a jab at any cost, you have a lot of needles you need to go get. And a flu shot every year.</p>

        <p>They've been introduced now because they're affecting rich nations. There are 5 malaria deaths in the US every year. About the same in the UK. If there were 5 Covid deaths in the US, you can bet we wouldn't give a flying fuck, even if it was killing thousands in Brazil. </p>
<p>When a new threat hits rich nations and has a significant impact, they'll take action to prevent it.</p>
<p>The flu and pneumonia kills ~50k people in the US each year. We have a vaccine for it each year. It should come as no surprise that we take a virus that kills ~600k Americans in a year a little more seriously.</p>

        <p>That’s a fallacy of false equivalence. Measles or smallpox are not covid. They are some of the more deadly viruses in the known world. Covid sars-2 is merely a corona virus which is novel so our immune systems react poorly. Creating a cytokine storm that older, sick, or obese people tend to die from. Otherwise healthy individuals fight off covid over 98% of the time sometimes without any symptoms. Smallpox doesn’t act like that or measles. They can kill healthy people and children.</p>

        <p>In 1980, 2.6 million people died from measles. From 1985 to 1992, 0.2% of measles victims died.</p>
<p>In the past year, 3.4 million people died from Covid-19. During this time, 2% of Covid victims died.</p>
<p>Maybe you can justify it by claiming that it's mostly old people, so maybe young people have a death rate closer to measles, and we don't really care about old people anyway. Or maybe you'll say that a rash from measles is worse than a cough from Covid, so despite the higher death rate and higher deaths we shouldn't care. Or maybe a 10x death rate isn't enough to offset the potential risks of a vaccine that you feel is scary, because you don't trust all the doctors, scientists, nations, and companies that have designed, studied, and tested it. Or maybe you just feel like maybe measles isn't a big deal now, and you won't vaccinate your kids against it.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, just be consistent. I probably won't convince you to trust the vaccine. Certainly I'm no expert. But if you're going to decide that you're really doing the best thing by not taking it, be damn sure that you've done everything in your power to understand the risks.</p>

Now, maybe they'll push out vaccines that don't last as long so they can get recurring revenue, but vaccines that cause serious side effects are a no go.</p>
<p>A handful of people dying from blood clots is hard to pick up in studies. If one in a million people have that happen, it's not going to be caught in a study of 70000 people. The risk is still lower than the risks from Covid, and even still the vaccines have been pulled from many regions now.</p>
<p>The point of the vaccine right now is to stop the spread and stop the deaths right now. As time goes on we can produce more vaccines, do further testing, do more research, and get booster shots. We can either do that while thousands of people are dying every day because they're not vaccinated, or we can do that while dozens of people are dying every day. It's not a hard choice.</p>
<p>There are plenty of peer reviewed published studies. It's been the primary focus of research for the past year, every issue of Nature has new ones. The truth is, you haven't read them, and you have no intention of reading them.</p>

        <p>Essentially. But you support more death, and I support less. Unless somehow the vaccine is shockingly worse for us than we realize - but there's no reason why the odds of that would be higher than the odds of Covid being shockingly worse for us than we realize.</p>

        <p>The scientific process was followed. The mNRA mechanism has been undergoing research since 1978. Tests were run in parallel rather than sequentially to speed up approval, but that only makes it riskier for the test groups. Science told us that the risk of Covid outweighed the risk of these vaccines.</p>
