        <p>Actually, it started with the head of one party being granted emergency powers following the burning of the Reichstag. That person then never gave up those powers.</p>

        <p>Yes. This is exactly what happened in Canada. Though I will not promote/disregard a 'false flag' claim, I must still deal with the end result as how I see it.</p>
<p>Yes, they took power using Covid19 as an excuse, and have been running with the ball now for 15 months - after saying '2 weeks to flatten the curve'.</p>
<p>And in many areas of Canada it still continues, with no end in sight.</p>
<p>We are 'opening up', but not really, as Mask mandates still remain, and businesses now threaten continued Mask use and coercive techniques to get their employees to vaccinate, either as a condition of employment or for continued employment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, government cuts back covid19 benefits as well, in a bid to 'encourage' people to return back into the workplace - thrusting them between a rock and a hard place, with a severe decision to make "Do I get to work and feed myself, or do I reject the Mask/Vaccine?"</p>

        <p>I think you see things exactly correctly.</p>
<p>&rt;Though I will not promote/disregard a 'false flag' claim, I must still deal with the end result as how I see it.</p>
<p>And this is an important point. We don't need to know the why,  to know they're not being honest with us. There is just no way I will gain enough credulity to think that governments and international corporations care about me and my life enough to be acting this way solely for my own good. That some people choose to pretend otherwise is troubling.</p>

        <p>Printing emergency Powers was not what happened. That was just how he did it. But you can grant all the emergency Powers you want. One man still cannot commit a genocide no matter how many emergency Powers he has unless he has the consent of the citizenry..</p>
<p>You can call them whatever you want. King. Dictator. Emperor. President. No matter what you call them they are still just one man. In a nation of millions.. one man cannot rule millions without their consent..</p>
<p>That is why revolutions happe</p>
<p>So it was not specifically the emergency powers it helped but that was not all. It was a slow burn. Slowly building up. It did not start with gas Chambers and train cars. It did not start with military leaders going door-to-door searching people's attic..</p>
<p>It started with one party assuming control and controlling the media the message and all the powers of government. It started with vilifying other people and making people hate them. Blaming One race for all of the world's problems. Blaming one group of people for "hurting"" the country</p>
<p>You can talk about Trump all you want but he was never going to start a holocaust. He was never confident enough and he was never motivated to do such a thing. No it's the man who tries to get all the power that would do such a thing..</p>
<p>You think that you're so much more advanced than the Nazi Germany because what? You lived slightly after it?.</p>
<p>Statistically you would have been a nazi. Statistically 90% of the country would have been Nazis or in support of the Nazi regime. The reality is just that..</p>
<p>It starts when one party controls everything. All levers of government all of the secret police or FBI all of the surveillance all of the media. You can call yourself a democracy but if one party has control of everything like that then you don't live in a nation ruled by the peopl</p>
<p>Questioning the ruling party or it's dictator you get banned from all social media and silenced from every major outlet of communication that's not democracy and that's not freedom. That's a dictatorship. When you can have your bank accounts closed and seized for protesting against the dictator. When the media is controlled by that very dictator..</p>

        <p>My point is that governments have a long history of using a crisis to grab more power, more wealth, to further invade privacy etc.</p>
<p>If there is no real crisis they are known for creating fake ones.</p>

        <p>You are making a critical mistake here. You are suggesting that it was caused by one person. If someone had gone back in time and killed Hitler-as-a-toddler, it would have changed nothing. The fearful crowd would have chosen another Fitler or Gitler to push to the front to lead them. This is a herd stampeding in one direction, and someone is accidentally at the front of the herd. If they don't agree with what is happening, they can drop back into the herd, and then there is another person at the front. Eventually, one person decides they like the leader position.</p>
<p>It is exactly the negative answer to "where is the new Hitler then?" that prevents people from recognizing what is happening.</p>

<p>they have literally forgotten that it was against the 'normalization' and standardization' of every aspect of life.   </p>
<p>As the meme correctly points out they didn't start with gas chambers,, in fact the gas chambers and the true horrors were only discovered at the end of the war.  Long after many people had sacrificed their lives trying to stop the fascist forces.</p>
<p>FFS did they think they can spot fascism by their boots and badges...</p>

        <p>I've seen this photo shared by a super left leaning, now proclaimed "proud liberal socialist", "friend" on facebook. This person literally cannot see how the powers that be right now have always marched towards this idea, they strictly blame Republicans or Trump only. This person is BLIND to how the media works and has been working this entire pandemic. This person is highly supportive of everyone having a vax passport and blaming those who are not vaxxed, masked or unsupportive of passports, AND THEY SHARED THIS EXACT PHOTO!! <strong>How do you fix that kind of brainwashing???</strong> How do you get someone to realize they are actually the ones who would have thrown the jews into the pits back then, even though they think they are on the saving side??</p>

        <p>show them the similarities to fascism, however tread the waters carefully, mentioning the third reich immediately activates a sort of mental blockade with these people, doing it too on the nose isnt going to cut it either, it needs finesse and trust to fix them and show how far they have betrayed themselves.</p>

        <p>Aaaand in other news, the local in Hong Kong, that was controlled by the Beijing CCP government, decided to freeze all assets of Apple Daily, the last printed newspaper (not purely web news) that is famous for printing stories that critized the government and being sympathetic to dissentants living in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>By freezing the assets, reporters and other staff had to be let off since management can no longer pay their wages.</p>
<p>Carrie Lam, the head of HK government and the "Piglet" sock puppet to Winnie the Pooh up North, claimed that the freezing of assets is justified for "national security" reasons and they would help out the poor staff members harmed by their employers not paying their wages. Also this is not an attack on freedom of press since news media can still report news as long as it does not harm "national security".</p>

        <p>I work in childrens social care.
One of the most horrible things I saw during the more extreme portions of the lockdowns here in the UK was social care stopping family members from seeing each other, even children and parents, if they lived in different homes.</p>
<p>And social workers, whose job it is to protect and ensure  the wellbeing of children, enforced this.</p>
<p>It showed my who many of my colleagues were: either panic stricken and easily led by propaganda, or people who simply did not care because they wanted an easier life without conflict with higher management. These are "educated" people who should know better.</p>
<p>And this is how facism encroachs. When people are either scared, or apathetic.</p>
<p>I am not being hyperbolic. To see this go on in the UK despite the high vaccination target being reached, watching the goalposts shift again, and the under 18s being called "reservoirs" of disease, all while the media blasts out propaganda and ignores the hypocrisy of the authorities, is truly frightening.</p>

        <p>And let’s not also forget that blackshirts were a volunteer group. These people were integral for suppressing dissent, gaslighting people, and vilifying groups. It was an example of the false consensus effect: when you stifle dissent, and demonize undesirable groups, pretty soon it appears that everyone agrees. If everyone agrees (that the Jews and other uncleans are responsible for all our woes), then how can it be wrong? </p>
<p>We are literally watching that stage happen right now, except the would-be blackshirts are being aided by billion dollars tech companies who control the public square. That means the blackshirts don’t have to sniff around cafes and student groups- they can just shut them down from the top.</p>

People like us need to show the power hungry “leaders” that their authority means NOTHING to us.

        <p>Explain the American Revolution. Underdogs rose up against the “power” and prevailed. It all starts when people realize they’re being controlled and stop playing by big brother’s rules. We haven’t seen it in our lifetime.. which is why you’re probably so pessimistic about the idea. So many awesome historical events where the little guys stopped taking the big guys shit. It’s possible if you’ve got the heart and the man-power. Also, I’m not your buddy lol</p>

        <p>Hey we're having a nice talk here friend! I have some questions though, since you're the history buff. How many tanks did the English have in the American Revolution? Additionally, how many rednecks with hunting rifles and shot guns would it take to penetrate one single U.S. Army tank? Do "We The People" have any organized air power to use to combat the U.S. Air Force? Once the government turns off cell towers, how are we going to communicate orders to our rallied forces? I feel like there was a very recent attempt at dismantling the government that possibly we could use as reference as to how all of this may go down. I think it was in early January... remember some people died or something.. not sure.</p>

        <p>You lost all credibility when you referred to January 6th lmaooo. There’s actual footage of the security waving people in and the antifa tough guy dressed up as a trump supporter. There was nothing violent about it besides the fact that security shot an innocent girl. The government welcomed that little meet and greet so they could make people like you think it was a terrorist attack on our nation and beg them for guidance even more. I’m sure you also think white supremacy is our country’s greatest threat, yeah? I can’t tell if you love and trust and believe our government or if you’ve just given up hope and you’re here to take your anger out on people that still have hope.</p>

        <p>To be fair, that lady was shot after numerous warnings by the Secret Service officers. There was real potential for violence that day. What do you think would have happened if protestors got face to face with a senator? Heck, there was "hang pence" signs all over the place. Many of the protestors were armed, too.</p>
<p>Was it handled correctly? Certainly not. But don't call it a peaceful protest because it certainly wasn't.</p>

Your blind ignorance is the reason the insurrection even happened and now you are denying the events occured at all. It's history man, you can't change that.

        <p>In the current state of the world I don't think it's dead, but speech is certainly not free</p>
