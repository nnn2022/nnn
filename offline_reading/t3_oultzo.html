        <p>I'm a hairstylist and one time I was talking to a client about how a public school in the area had recently gone to 4 day school weeks. I was talking about how I thought it was great, and how tired my kids always are coming home from school, how it makes sense for the school to go year round with less time in the classroom per week, etc. Then, he says to me, the hourly employee cutting his hair at 7pm, "Man that would be a nightmare for child care." I guffawed and said "Every parent working jobs like mine has to figure out child care too, why is your schedule more important than mine?" People are seriously out of touch.</p>

        <p>Tbh YTA. He said something reasonable and you attacked him personally by assuming he thinks he's more important than you. No where did I read that.</p>
<p>Seems like you guys were just having a conversation and he brought up the challenge of finding childcare for his children 1 workday a week, which is a challenge and in no way a reflection on your job? Why did you feel slighted?</p>
<p>That must have been an awkward haircut after your outburst?</p>

        <p>There was more to the conversation that I left out for brevity, so I can see why I look like a jerk. This was a regular client for starters, someone I'd known for a few years and came in often. I wouldn't have said that to someone I didn't know. I also didn't have an "outburst". I laughed because he said something super out of touch, something he realized after I responded. I also was not attacking him with my words, I said it in a very calm manner that was posing a question and offering a different perspective than anything else. It also wasn't awkward because he understood immediately when I said it that I had a really good point.  This was a calm, rational conversation, not me yelling irrationally that he was out of touch.</p>

        <p>Don't forget about all the people in other countries whose enter lives and cities were ruined because we slowed down our economy. Like, do you care about Indian or African lives? Because now an entire family can't put food on the table because of you. This was seriously one of the very first 2nd order effects I thought of last March, right after realizing how fucked many people in the US would be.</p>

        <p>Reposting a comment I've posted a few times:</p>
<p>A "real lockdown" is impossible. You would have to put the military on every street, shooting people on sight.</p>
<p>No jobs would be "essential", so forget about emergency services. Sick with covid? No hospital for you. Heart attack? Dead. Stroke? Cya. Fire? Your block's burnt down now.</p>
<p>Power stations don't keep working without people manning them, so no electricity after a couple days. Better hope it doesn't get cold enough to need to heat your home.</p>
<p>Sure hope you stocked up on 2 weeks worth of drinking water, since those pumps don't work without electricity.</p>
<p>The internet doesn't exactly work without electricity either, so even those jobs that can be worked from home aren't going to happen. And of course, no Netflix. Hope you've got books and candlelight to read them by.</p>

        <p>Believe it or not they were already eating out at overpriced restaurants for most of their meals so it's just a little more expensive now with the $3 delivery fee. But those are easily saved through spending on transit, parking, business clothes and dry cleaning, etc. So they are actually saving and investing money during the lockdowns, so it's a financial incentive to stay lockdown.</p>

        <p>I understand your frustration! I understand a sense of hmmm things are not right. It’s figuring out what is angering people. Government ineptitude? Betrayal? I feel both. </p>
<p>Re: this crap situation-I’ve studied CoVs. Mainly FCoV and have had COVID myself. I’m still not 💯 and it’s been over a year. I’m fit. No preexisting conditions. This sucks. I don’t want anyone to feel this way. When I was sick gasping for air was terrifying. I mean that in the truest sense of the word. </p>
<p>I know everyone has had it with all that is COVID. I hear you and I’m tired of it too. COVID has really opened people’s eyes. Everyone is angry. Everyone is stressed. The cause of that anger is what people cannot agree on. I hate this and want it to stop.</p>

        <p>I would have disliked that also, and I'm skeptical that it would have happened.</p>
<p>I wish Mr. Trump had been honest about what we should expect: disease and above-average mortality, not magic; had appropriately compared the small, preventable risk posed by COVID with the much greater risks Americans routinely accept; and had used the extraordinary tools at his disposal to disappear—kidnap, not murder—those most vocally in favor of COVID (<em>e.g.</em>, Dr. Fauci, Governor Whitmer). I believe that most Americans would have responded proportionately and acted as Americans usually do in the face of death—with casual indifference. Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In 1957, the Asian flu pandemic <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1957-1958-pandemic.html">killed about 116,000 Americans</a> (0.07% of the population) without arousing much fuss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemic <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1968-pandemic.html">killed about 100,000 Americans</a>, again without triggering much reaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 2017 and 2018, the American public successfully ignored <a href="https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/news/20180927/80000-americans-died-from-flu-last-year">the more than <em>80,000</em> deaths</a> caused by influenza. I am surrounded by pretentious liberals, and not one of them expressed <em>any</em> concern about this during or afterwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The American public successfully ignores the fact that perhaps <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12230315/">300,000 Americans die <em>yearly</em></a> from obesity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assuming a (high) 0.5% case fatality rate, 90% of the United States population catching Wuhan disease would have caused about 1.5 million deaths—only about five years' worth of fat-related deaths from a once-in-a-lifetime level of danger.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion: I believe that, had it not been for the pretentious, shrieking progressives and their enablers, we would have endured COVID without fuss; and I believe that a prompt, accurate, calculated application of force could have kept their mischief at bay until it was too late. (For a related example, consider how Dr. Daszak's <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1656">prompt, accurate, calculated application of misinformation</a> kept the lab-leak hypothesis from seeing the light of day for more than a year.)</p>

        <p>Thank you for responding and engaging in conversation. I wish people could discuss things more. What do you know about subversion? Active measures? </p>
<p>What impact do you think Fox has influenced the narrative? What do you think about bringing back the Fairness Doctrine? My grandfather worked for Fox. I was raised Baptist. I’m not a radical liberal or radical anything. I’m a conservative but the GOP isn’t rational right now. </p>
<p>Did you live in with a SARS or MERS outbreak? Have you had COVID? I have studied CoVs, FCoV  prior to SARS-CoV-2. I’ve lived in an area where SARS hit in 2003. I’ve had COVID. I don’t want you or anyone else to deal with what I faced. Gasping for air sucked. I’d rather off myself than experience that again.</p>

<p>Oh that’s right. Places with the strictest lockdowns and mask mandates have been getting hit the hardest per capita all along. Sounds like the “fucking idiot” is you, basing your ideas on emotion and not logic.</p>

You simply parrot whatever baseless claims you’ve heard elsewhere, then when asked to back up your own claim with evidence, you result to name calling and other leftist talking points.

        <p>Agreed. Blaming individuals is fruitless and idiotic. You have to take human nature into account. But of course, that takes away their moral high horse and easy scapegoat. They enjoy being able to insult and shame others with impunity. Many people lived with bottled up rage issues for years and years and now they get to unleash it under the guise of concern for public health.</p>

        <p>I totally agree.</p>
<p>I should compare the odds of winning "Big" in most lotteries compared to that of catching and of dying from COVID.</p>
<p>And I'm not even that healthy compared to what I could be (as I slurp a beer while writing).</p>
<p>I wrote this elsewhere: Even if it was a 50/50 coin toss that I could catch COVID and die. If I took COVAX I'd be flipping the coin twice at the very least.</p>
<p>Once for side-effects (including death) of the injection, and a second time for the "Delta variant".</p>

        <p>Those people can be safely dismissed as morons. They don't understand what EVERYONE staying at home means--which is the complete and utter breakdown of society and countless deaths due to the lack of available medical care and food (not to mention suicides and even drug/alcohol withdrawals).</p>

        <p>George Washington literally ordered the revolutionary army to get the smallpox vaccine.</p>
<p>Police powers are reserved to the state - including lockdowns.</p>
<p>There are no forced vaccinations.  If your employer requires it, that's their right, get another job.</p>
<p>We haven't gone far enough.  Those who are  unvaccinated should see their health insurance premiums quadruple if not more, you should have proof of vaccination to get on public transit, etc.</p>

        <p>But you replied to my comment. My comment was specifically based on confirmed infections, or closed cases. Your numbers are based on the worldwide population including people who have not been infected. So they are both facts, but they are two very different facts. Can you see that?</p>

        <p><em>News</em> can be good or bad though, and since the whole world has been turned upside down for an allegedly 'once in a hundred years' pandemic that has scared the wits out of half the population, the good news is that more than 99.9% of us haven't died.  We didn't shut the world down for cancer, or for anything else.  We did for Covid.  It affected all of us, everyone, one way or another.  So yes, I will confidently say that more than 99.9% of us 'survived'.</p>

        <p>The survival rate for any disease or condition would look much better if you included people who never actually had the condition. Both are factual numbers, and if people want to know both they should be able to. It’s much easier to make informed decisions the more informed you are.</p>

        <p>I like facts a lot, that is why I presented <em>the very most important</em> one to you, which needs no interpretation.  That isn't 'padding' anything at all.  How can you say that anything is more important than the survival rate?  We don't even know who has contracted it or not, but we do know who died and who didn't.  And we also know that everyone suffered, and I'm glad that you can at least see that.</p>
<p>More than a 99.9% survival rate is great news!  For some reason you keep trying to find negative out of that.  It's really really weird.</p>

        <p>The method of calculating the survival rate is not used  with any other infectious disease, and there’s a reason for that. Non infected people are counted as survivors, not for cancer, for for HIV, not for Ebola, etc.</p>
<p>It’s not a matter of opinion, you’re just wrong. You may as well try to argue that 1+1=3 because you want it to. It doesn’t and it’s wrong.</p>

        <p>Dude, I linked you <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nyqzr2/world_population_7872300000_of_c19_deaths_3810952/">the math</a> which included the sources.</p>
<p>Look, I've tried to be respectful and forthright with you, but I think now you are just yanking my chain.</p>
<p>If you <strong>must</strong> continue on Reddit all day, perhaps you'd like to check my post history even further.  I will sleep good knowing you are doing that.  Enjoy brother, I particularly like <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/otsbk3/funny_thing_today_at_smart_final_southern/">this</a> post I made the other day.  Perhaps that was you.</p>

        <p><em>News</em> can be good or bad though, and since the whole world has been turned upside down for an allegedly 'once in a hundred years' pandemic that has scared the wits out of half the population, the good news is that more than 99.9% of us haven't died.  We didn't shut the world down for cancer, or for anything else.  We did for Covid.  It affected all of us, everyone, one way or another.  So yes, I will confidently say that more than 99.9% of us 'survived'.</p>
<p>I've mentioned this to many people such as yourself and I never get acknowledgment that this is good news.  It's really weird.</p>

        <p>Yeah well my business being able to remain open so I can feed my family is pretty beneficial. Cars kill people! Why don't you want to ban cars?? Obviously you don't care about human life otherwise you would be banning cars! I cant believe how selfish you are, no one needs a car. Just walk or bike places. Wow it's just a few miles, I cant believe you're making a big deal over cars.</p>

<p>As for cars, they serve a beneficial purpose, and with the correct safety measures in place the risk of death and injury is greatly reduced. They are also not microscopic or contagious.</p>

Dont you care about human life? you're so selfish, cars don't serve any benefit because they kill people. I can't believe you're willing to risk human life because you need to drive somewhere, you're so incredibly selfish. Just stay home! And if you need to leave your home, walk! It's been proven that even with safety measures, people die in car accidents all the time. Why would you take that risk of human life?</p>

        <p>I didn’t realise we were fighting, or arguing. I just wanted to share the facts. Then you went on about cars endlessly and ignored my side of the conversation completely. The loss of your business and ability to support your family would be understandably traumatic, and I am genuinely sorry to hear that.

        <p>Yeah you have been very civil, I commend you for that.</p>
<p>Your car is completely within your control, but you can't guarantee you won't get into an accident. So you can consider it "contagious" in the sense that people outside of your car could be harmed too ;)</p>
<p>And even ignoring that, the vaccines don't even prevent infection, and vaccinated people have just as much viral load as the unvaccinated, so why mandate it?</p>

        <p>Nice to see that some people realise you can have different opinions without the need to try and bring down others.</p>
<p>I’m not a doctor or a specialist in the field, I take my advice from medical experts for the same reason I take my car to a mechanic. Luckily I have 3 doctors in the family, so I know I can trust them. I’ve also had all my others vaccines, as has my daughter. We’re both fit and healthy. I also don’t care about mandating vaccines, people can choose.</p>
<p>My main point from the start was just that people should stick to facts. Both sides of this debate have valid points, but statin incorrect facts will cost anyone credibility.</p>
<p>Other than that, I don’t wish anyone ill. Everyone deserves to be happy.</p>

        <p>False premise. You want to ban people from <em>living life</em>. If we could just "ban covid" I'd be all for it, but obviously it doesn't work that way.</p>

        <p>&rt; Why do you care what other people think or do? </p>
<p>Because they’re the ones forcing their beliefs on me and literally coming door to door to shove them down my throat. They’re the ones blocking me from going to the colleges I wanted to apply for. They’re the ones threatening to make it difficult to shop for food. They’re the ones threatening to make it hard to get a job to support myself. They’re the ones who stop me from flying to countries where my loved ones are. All because I won’t cave to their beliefs and allow myself to be the subject of a medical experiment. I have to care what they believe and do because they took away the option of not caring. </p>
<p>This isn’t a matter of “agree to disagree” anymore. One side is becoming an authoritarian monster and the other side just wants to live in peace. We are not the same and we cannot coexist like this.</p>

        <p>&rt; They’re the ones blocking me from going to the colleges I wanted to apply for.</p>
<p>I think it's the colleges themselves that are deciding how they individually want to re-open this fall. Sounds like the schools you are interested in don't share your beliefs. In any case they are making their own decisions, it's not one person deciding for all schools like a dictator.</p>
<p>&rt; They’re the ones threatening to make it difficult to shop for food.</p>
<p>That's a new one. In the absolute worst case scenario you wear a mask, or pick it up curbside at the store, or get it delivered to your door. Or don't, literally nobody is forcing you to do any of that.</p>
<p>&rt; They’re the ones threatening to make it hard to get a job to support myself.</p>
<p>Employers and companies make decisions independently, again it's not one person deciding for everyone like a dictator. </p>
<p>&rt; They’re the ones who stop me from flying to countries where my loved ones are.</p>
<p>You can fly anywhere you want, it's up to the destination country whether or not they want to allow you in, for how long, and under what conditions. </p>
<p>Overall it sounds like you just choose to be upset instead of just living life and dealing with it. You are free to open your own grocery store, university, airline, or business. Nobody is stopping you. </p>
<p>If someone takes the time, effort, and great expense to run a grocery store, university, airline, or other business I would really think they'd be hard pressed to take input from someone like you who has absolutely no stake in the success or failure of their enterprise.</p>
<p>In short, it sounds like you're the one who is demanding others do what you want. They have no obligation to. You are free to go elsewhere in literally every case you cited.</p>

        <p>Were you trying to say “natural course” is funny because it’s a manufactured virus? Meaning it’s not a natural occurrence. And therefore laughable that someone would call it the natural course of the virus?</p>

        <p>I strive for a bit of sarcasm or humor in just about everything I say. Angry people don’t think straight, and it’s really hard to be pissed off when you’re laughing. Yeah. There was definitely more than one way to interpret what I said.</p>

        <p>At this point it’s not even about the virus anymore. It’s about how the global elite are testing the waters to see how much control they can take over our lives and get away with it. When they said you can take off your masks, but then two months later “nope, never mind”; It’s like a cat playing with a mouse. It’s not about the science or the virus, it’s all about control.</p>

<p>800,000+ kids go missing in the United States every year. </p>
<p>We spent over 6 trillion dollars in the US alone on covid which could end world hunger for 23 years on the high end (for 256 billion a year) or 857 years on the low end (7 billion a year) for an average of 440 years of world hunger ended. </p>
<p>7,200 children die per day from starvation/malnutrition. 2.6million a year. </p>
<p>9 million people total per year die of starvation. </p>
<p>It’s not about health and well being. They don’t give a fuck about you or anyone else. </p>
<p>you’re fucking brainwashed.</p>

        <p>Then you’ve figured it out, haven’t you? The government doesn’t care about you. They never have, never will. They don’t act in our best interests and covid is no different. It’s all about control and fear, none of it is actually helping to save lives.</p>
<p>Putting that money into tackling the issues that make people vulnerable to covid in the first place would have cost less and had a much larger impact.</p>

        <p>you can just say "i dont understand this" and no one will judge you and those who do are not worth it. look its ok to be wrong and admit it you dont have to keep up with the misinformation in fear you'll look stupid. in fact its the opposite. its called learning and its ok you'll be a better person for it. or stick to your guns and continue to look like an idiot. i was the same way and there would have been a time where i would be in your same spot but i learned and asked the professionals and and absorbed information from professionals and specialist who dedicated their lives to knowing. and i admitted i was wrong. honestly i hope the same from you. its not to late you dont need to save face. leave the cult, trust the professionals because they dedicated their lives to knowing.</p>

<p>The vaccinated spread the delta variant, the dominant strain in the United States. The benefit is only to the individual for reducing the severity of the illness, it does not protect others. Knowing this, and given that the vaccine is not yet fda approved: individuals should be allowed to run their own cost benefit analysis in their decision to vaccinate or not without having their employment and education threatened if they choose not to. </p>

<p>&rt; CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said recent studies had shown that those vaccinated individuals who do become infected with Covid have just as much viral load as the unvaccinated, making it possible for them to spread the virus to others.</p>

<p>&rt; TEL AVIV—About half of adults infected in an outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid-19 in Israel were fully inoculated with the Pfizer Inc. vaccine, prompting the government to reimpose an indoor mask requirement and other measures to contain the highly transmissible strain.</p>

<p>&rt; Pfizer and BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine is just 39% effective in Israel where the delta variant is the dominant strain, according to a new report from the country’s Health Ministry.</p>

        <p>I think the CDC reissuing mask requirements and them admitting the vaccine isn't as effective as they thought (well they're framing it as not as effective against variants) is putting more people to our side.  I've seen plenty of vaxxed folks that are pissed over this.</p>

        <p>Did you know that the Israeli data is pre print? Meaning it hasn’t been peer reviewed. Remember when Israel said they had a cure for cancer? What cancer who knows but cancer. Hmmmm. Access to information isn’t the same as knowing how to interpret the information correctly.</p>

        <p>It is. We actually came together to fund a giant vaccine program through taxes and then get it distributed to everyone at no cost. If you choose not to take it, that's your right. You're also free not to wear a seatbelt. I won't stop you on that front either.</p>

        <p>Was trying to explain this to my normie neighbor last night and told her none of it works and she said it’s because people will not get vaccinated. </p>
<p>I told her that even if you split the country in two with half vaccinated and half not vaccinated it would still spread among the vaccinated portion as evidence now shows. She simply could not compute this idea because she’s been told it’s all because some people do not get the shot. </p>
<p>How can you explain this to someone like her?</p>

<p>Isn't a big part of Australia in a full lockdown right now because they keep having new cases? They "eradicated" COVID but it still came back.</p>
<p>If you need to live up to your name as a "prison island" in order to prevent 1 or 2 deaths, then you haven't really "won".</p>
<p>&rt; China</p>
<p>China achieved natural immunity, and it cost them <em>many</em> deaths all in one go.</p>

        <p>Erm just to mention. The aim of a lockdown isnt to eliminate the virus or end the pandemic. Because even if it did reduce to zero, cases would start up again anyway due to new arrivals in the country. </p>
<p>The aim is to reduce cases down to as low a level as possible. So that (A) you can prevent the health care system from breaking and (B) manage the lower levels. </p>
<p>Saying that it's about eliminating the virus or ending the virus is just a strawman argument.</p>

        <p>So, you know what a fair test is in science?</p>
<p>A fair test is when you try to eliminate as many variables as possible, leaving only one variable that is tested. </p>
<p>So the variable that you wanna test is lockdown v non lockdown. And you should try to eliminate as many other factors as possible. </p>
<p>Factors such as population size, population density, culture, level of education, number of foreign travellers etc. </p>
<p>You wanna try to eliminate these factors but obviously different locations have differing levels of education, different population densities, different culture etc. So comparing country A v country B might not be very good because of these reasons. </p>
<p>Its much better to look at a particular country, at different times. So were cases rising before lockdown, were they decreasing after lockdown. In the uk, this is exactly what happened. </p>
<p>Let me ask this, if you had the flu which of these scenarios are you more likely to spread the flu.</p>
<p>A - You go to work and have several meetings with several different people. Then go shopping. Then go to a restaurant. Then go to a nightclub.</p>
<p>B - You stay at home the entire time.</p>
<p>Obviously you're less likely to spread the flu when you stay at home the entire time. Well, this is what lockdowns are.</p>

<p>False, I literally had several arguments with people yesterday who argued that we should extend lockdowns until COVID is completely eradicated. One of them compared it to how we eradicated polio and smallpox.</p>

<p>If the aim was to eradicate it, wouldn't you need international coordination? And there has been no global international coordination on when lockdowns happen. Doesn't this show that this isnt the aim?</p>

        <p>&rt;If the aim was to reduce it, then we should be fully reopening and ditching the masks.</p>
<p>Firstly, this is actually what is happening in the uk.</p>
<p>But, at the risk of being pedantic, the reasoning of 'cases have reduced therefore no masks' isnt necessarily true. When cases reduce in a unvaccinated population, you may still need masks as a method of preventing rising cases and therefore prevent a lockdown. But in a vaccinated population, reduced cases can lead to no more masks, depending on how well the vaccine works and what percentage of the population is vaccinated.</p>
<p>So its the vaccine rates that are mainly related to no more masks. Not the success or lack of success of lockdowns. Which is what the post was about.</p>
<p>&rt;What do you think the end goal is here?</p>
<p>This is the red herring fallacy. Bringing up a larger topic to distract from the point.</p>
<p>And my point is that the aim of a lockdown is to reduce cases by as much as possible. Not necessarily to zero. And the logical evidence that it was never meant to eradicate it like smallpox, was that unlike smallpox, there was no attempt at global international coordination, which is what is needed to eradicate a disease like this. </p>
<p>So does this logic show that the aim was not to eradicate the disease?</p>
<p>And if it does, do you accept the lockdowns work in the sense that the successful reduce cases?</p>

        <p>Too many people didn’t mask, didn’t social distance, didn’t get vaccinated. Coronaviruses are tricky. They are zoonotic. This is the third coronavirus strain to infect humans in the twenty years. SARS-COV-2 is a new coronavirus. We need to our systems by getting vaccinated. It protects YOU from the likelihood of severe illness, disability, or death. You still contract n spread so wear a mask until we get more people armored up. This is war. The enemy is invisible. The origin is a separate issue. Protect yourselves and each other.</p>

        <p>I have had COVID. I’ve also studied CoVs, mainly FCoV prepandemic. I’ve lived through SARS and MERS. I understand that this is an airborne virus that doesn’t create sterile immunity if you contract it. I understand that antibodies fade regardless of how they were acquired. I got vaccinated but I knew from day 1 that these vaccines are not capable of providing sterile immunity.</p>
<p>Was I angry at the messaging? HELL YES! I feel the people have been betrayed. It’s not a left or right thing. It’s a crap approach to handling the situation. I’m not looking for problems not trying to convince anyone of anything. The CDC and the WHO have lost a lot of credibility with a lot of people. When they said you didn’t need a mask when a novel coronavirus that is airborne and can be spread asymptomatically I knew we were screwed. I’m angry my country has failed to rise to the occasion.</p>

        <p>What claim did I make that isn’t true? That coronaviruses are zoonotic? They are. Was it that we have had two other coronaviruses infect humans in the last 20yrs? That’s true. SARS hit in 2003. MERS around 2014-2015. Coronaviruses are not new. This coronavirus is new to humans and we need to arm ourselves with the best weapon possible and that is the vaccine. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide have been vaccinated. This virus can seriously impact your life. Hospitalization isn’t cheap and even with insurance people are saddled with millions in debt. That sucks. Who wants to be sick, disabled, or dead. </p>

        <p>"Letting the government control my life?"  No, I have a toddler and a sick parent.  I'm more than happy to take mildly inconveniencing safety measures to protect them, those like them, and myself.  Maybe those measures don't help - in that case I can survive the minor inconvenience just fine.  But maybe they do help, and I can prevent someone like me from losing a child or a parent. I'm willing to pay that price. It's called basic human empathy.  Also, I don't have such a fragile ego that I react to public health officials telling me to take these measures with a tantrum.  That's what my toddler does.</p>

        <p>Well cars kill people! We need to ban cars if you want to eliminate car related deaths. People get in car crashes all the time even when wearing seatbelts and being cautious. So if you care about human life, get rid of cars, obviously. You're so selfish, cars arent necessary. Just walk places, it's not that hard. It's only a few miles.</p>

        <p>That's a bad analogy though, because covid kills people, not masks. So really if you wanted to make the car analogy you'd have to say we should ban seat belts because they're minorly inconvenient and most people don't die in car crashes. But that would be an idiotic thing to say, and clearly you're not a complete idiot, right?</p>

        <p>I never said masks kill people, covid does. We're trying to get rid of covid cases right? 0 cases is the goal, is it not? So we should do the same for cars and ban them so people dont die.

        <p>Yeah, so therefore, our goal is to reach 0 deaths a year from covid right? So by that logic, we should also ban cars because you can die from a car crash. We should ban swimming too, and mountain climbing. We don't want people dying from those, right? You don't care about human life if you don't want to ban those. Even if you have a 99 percent chance of living when you partake in these activities, it doesn't matter because deaths are still deaths.</p>

        <p>It's the super old people who are driving the death rate up like crazy.</p>

        <p>Most people in Australia live in giant cities, plus migrants from Indonesia could easily catch a boat to Australia so it's not as isolated as you think.</p>
<p>Although those did probably help,  but China has 1.4 billion people and is surrounded by more countries than any other country in the world. They got it under control in a couple months no problem, with the added disadvantage of going into the outbreak completely blind.</p>

        <p>Their 4k deaths is no doubt an underestimation, maybe by an order of magnitude at most, but they definitely got it under control.  To think otherwise is an unhinged conspiracy.</p>

        <p>In this case there is an equivalence though? If I’m sick, and go visit my grandma, I could get her sick and she could die. Hence, an innocent life taken because I wanted to exercise my personal freedom. </p>
<p>I said above, this isn’t hard to understand for most.</p>

        <p>&rt; New Zealand and Australia got covid under control</p>
<p>They announced that they were COVID-free, yet they keep getting re-infections and they keep locking down again. Not exactly a success story.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand are also isolated islands with incredibly strict immigration policies. If you tried to adopt those in the US, liberals and democrats would screech endlessly and you'd be declared a massive xenophobic racist.</p>
<p>Australian cops literally busted down the doors of a pregnant woman for being anti-lockdown on facebook. If you want to lick police boot so badly, you can always move there instead.</p>
