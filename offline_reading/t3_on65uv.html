    <strong>A fully vaccinated individual is "anti-booster shot" until proven otherwise</strong>
    <p><p>They have to realise this never ends.   </p>
<p>You're "fully vaccinated"? Oh but now we need booster shots, and I see you've not had one yet.  You're not one of those anti-vaxxers are you?  In fact, you are incorrect to say "fully vaccinated" - you were vaccinated against DooDah and DooDee, not BaBa and BoBo and (ad nauseum).  You're not being difficult, are you citizen? Why the hesitancy for the booster?  </p>
<p>There is no appeasement. You do X, then you will need to do Y.  Then finally...finally, Z must be the last thing, right? Nope, we loop back and we'll call the next thing A2.  Do A2, then B2.  Then C2.  There is no appeasement.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, you are taking risks with your health with each step.</p></p>

        <p>Most people I talk to that have had the shot have said (with some anger) they are not getting a booster. They are starting to realize they have been fooled and they are not happy.</p>

        <p>I sometimes think the booster is a red herring and they don't actually need it for whatever depopulation / control agenda they're planning with these gene poisons. </p>
<p>It might be a few extra bucks from the truly gullible, but they probably realise most people won't continue to keep taking these things forever.</p>
<p>Or it could be that they continue to enforce boosters with the ones dependent on the system too stuck to back out. </p>
<p>Will have to see come winter time which is looking more likely.</p>

        <p>Even worse, check out the policy language on this one. By showing proof of vaccination, participants agree to comply with future boosters or repeat vaccinations on a recurring basis and according to CDC recommendations. Diabolical, and I'm hoping illegal. </p>
<p>"Participation: Participation in the COVID-19 Vaccination Program (by providing proof of vaccination or obtaining an approved Exception or Deferral under this policy). Participation is a condition of Physical Presence at any University Location or Program as set forth in this policy. For Covered Individuals who must be vaccinated under this policy, Participation compliance will require repeat vaccinations or boosters on an annual or recurring basis consistent with FDA-approved labeling and CDC recommendations."</p>
<p>"FDA approved labeling" refers to laws under U.S. Code &rt; Title 21 &rt; CHAPTER 9 &rt; SUBCHAPTER V that require any medical treatment authorized for emergency medical use to be clearly labeled in regards to how the treatment may be used and administered. </p>

        <p>LOL, this is beyond Orwell.  How in the everloving feck can you give informed consent to future booster shots that haven't even been brought to market yet? This isn't even agreeing to a trial.  It's agreeing to a future trial of an unknown substance.  "We're going to inject into you a substance that even we don't know what will contain...at some point in the future, you good?"</p>
