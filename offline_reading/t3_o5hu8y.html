    <strong>You won't find a more compliant country than Wales and yet we're still way off ending restrictions. THIS IS NOT ABOUT A VIRUS.</strong>
    <p><p>Over the past year I can count the number of maskless people I've seen in shops on one hand. Everyone I know follows the rules as best they can, most of my immediate friends and family have gotten jabbed up, and there's been barely any surges or spikes in cases, let alone deaths. Over the course of a year we've had just over 5,000 deaths WITH Covid. You might chalk that up to the Covid restrictions working but I think if you compared Wales (a mostly rural country with small towns) with other places it would actually work out around the same percentage wise. Not to mention we're spending 10 million pounds a week on these fucking restrictions (how?!); I am seriously worried about what this means for our economy.</p>
<p>But the kicker? The fuck-bucket in charge has delayed ending restrictions, despite us having zero deaths for days in a row now, and when we have had deaths in the weeks prior they've never risen above single digits. He's gone on record as saying restrictions are likely to stay AT LEAST until 2022. And no one gives a shit! They'll grumble, sure, but people absolutely refuse to see the writing on the wall. Covid is only the 31st leading cause of death in Wales: why are we still masking up and socially distancing? The economy will never recover at this rate.</p>
<p>5,572 deaths attributed to a cold virus does not justify this level of tyranny and control. We will not comply our way out of this. The game is rigged. It doesn't matter if a third wave doesn't happen as Welsh scientists have predicted, there will be no apology or admission of poor judgement on the part of twat-head in chief Drakeford, whose sole ambition is to remain in power and do whatever England's doing but with a small caveat to the rules to appear different. No wonder he raised a nonce if this is how he fucking behaves when he's got authority over people, what a fucking bastard.</p></p>

        <p>Sickening what's happening in Wales. I don't think any of us in the UK can say that we live in respectable, liberal-democratic nations anymore. This is literal tyranny and something (anything!) must be done about it sharpish or this is going to be a permanent state of affairs. That Drakeford is a fucking rodent, and the fact he's anywhere near political office speaks volumes about our decline as a civilization.</p>
