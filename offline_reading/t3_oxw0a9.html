    <strong>Stabby jabby</strong>
    <p><p>Friend of mine fell for the stabby jabby nonsense and her kids are stabbed and jabbed (for school??) anyway she had to cancel an appt I had scheduled for tomorrow, why?? stabbed and jabbed kid has the  rona.  I guess those stabs and jabs really dont work?  Kid is high school age and 'devastated' about missing the first 2 weeks of school.  The younger kid now needs a brain cell scrape as well a mom, mom's man friend and man friends child. (all jabbed).   </p>
<p>I thought the stabby jabby prevented this nonsense?  So let me get this straight, the govt or insurance paid for the stabby and now the govt or insurance is paying for 5 people to get brain cells scraped.  Plus at least one kid is missing 2 weeks of school- private tuition school.</p>
<p>My family and kids are NOT stabbed and jabbed and so far are just fine or had the rona and didnt notice.  (its allergy season here, we have asthma etc, who knows at this point really). I'm not having my brain cells scraped every time someone sneezes.</p>
<p>What is the point of the vaxx if you still get the rona?  take your damn flu of 2021 and be done with it.  Its a fucking virus.  let your body build up some immunity.</p></p>

Why is that we haven’t been effected by this massive hypnotic effect?</p>

        <p>The funny part is we now know those with the jab can still transmit the disease as well as the unjabbed.  It does nothing for prevention it just reduces symptoms...</p>
<p>So, since the symptoms will be entirely on my shoulders, let me stay unjabbed and if I die, I die.  I'm no more or less of a threat than the jabbies.  They feel all high and mighty for no reason at all.</p>
<p>I hope all of them get sick with this typically recoverable disease. I hope everyone who gets covid makes a full recovery, but these blowhards are humbled by the shot doing nothing.</p>

        <p>does the jabby reduce symptoms? im interested to find out how 'sick' her child actually is. (or how much high school drama the kid is playing out).  All she said was 'rona symptoms' which can mean anything from a stubbed toe to apparently the ICU on a vent (eyes rolling here)  Im pretty sure the kid is closer to allergy symptoms.</p>

        <p>It's supposed to reduce symptoms, pretty much the only thing it is supposed to do. Pretty specific vaccine - doesn't prevent infection, death, or transmission, but is said to reduce symptoms.</p>
<p>Might as well take ivermectin in that case.</p>
<p>Strange how people who I know that avoided getting sick for 16 months, got sick after getting their jab.</p>

        <p>It is supposed to prevent the disease caused by SARS COV2. These people are still infected. The virus is can still Infect. If you asked me I would say what is happening is the virus is still being transmitted only when a vaccined person gets it, they're body is not destroying the virus because there immune system is not recognizing it as a threat because the "vaccine" programs you're cells to produces the spike protein,, which essentially is the body of the virus. So it will not cause the symptoms which viruses cause as a means to spread. There for it is mutating looking for a way to cause symptoms, thus created a new disease, more OR less dangerous . Hard to say. I give you this information as a hypothesis because they have yet to provide evidence of SARS COV2 so what disease causing viruses this "vaccine" is designed to alter would most likely be a already existing coronavirus. Most likely the common cold.</p>
