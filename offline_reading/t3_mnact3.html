    <strong>Let your local businesses know that they will lose your patronage if they adopt vaccine passports</strong>
    <p><p>The flurry of social engineering is pressing people so hard to share how enthusiastic they are about getting their jabs that it may appear to businesses that everybody will ultimately get vaccinated and as such, vaccine passports are a no brainer to get their business fully reopened. We must be pro-active in our communication and counter this perception by letting our local businesses know that if they adopt vaccine passports they will lose our patronage. A good tactic I found for those who have the chance to live in places where businesses are partially opened is to leave a note at the bottom of the tab such as: "Please don't require vaccine passports so we can come back again. Thank you :-)".</p>

<p>Let's be proactive and not let businesses believe that vaccine passports will be a win for them! What other communication tactics do you have in mind?</p></p>

        <p>It's not a bad idea, but in reality, the only places that are going to require passports are mega corporations that don't give a shit what we think. And they're going to crush the little businesses that won't require the passport. </p>
<p>We need to pressure politicians to ban them completely.</p>

        <p>Big businesses will be the first to deploy them but it won't stop there. Many local officials will allow local businesses to open at a higher capacity at the condition they check for vaccination status. This is already happening...</p>

<p>I believe this is already happening. It's just not evident yet because of the ongoing lockdown. Me and others I read about have replaced various local services with a DIY approach. You get the tools and knowledge for whatever you need and gradually you become better an better on it. It will be called "surprising" in the news, at some point and it is unfortunate for local businesses, but they didn't react for over a year now. Rather they are comfortable getting gov funding.</p>
