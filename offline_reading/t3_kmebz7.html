    <strong>Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon</strong>
    <p><p>"Ridicule is man's most potent weapon. There is no defense. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage."
- Saul Alinsky, Rules For Radicals</p>
<p>As I’m sure we are all well aware, ridicule is by far the most common tactic used against our movement, those who oppose us make damn well sure that nobody will take us seriously. Ridicule is the most common and effective rhetorical device, even though it is considered bad form in serious debate, it is absolutely ubiquitous in mass media and increasingly in academia. </p>
<p>This is not about partisan politics and I firmly believe it shouldn’t be, but it is worth noting that Alinsky was a far left activist in the mid 20th century. He was Hilary Clinton’s mentor and her thesis was written on this very book. Regardless of your political views, it is pretty obvious that American conservatives and traditionalists have done nothing but lose, over and over, for the last century. They refuse to “stoop down to the level” of their opposition, they want to use serious good faith arguments to convince people that they are the rational choice. Meanwhile the left plays dirty, they will use any and every tactic, pull every emotional string to propagate their ideology. When you have one side that says “the other side is evil” and one side that says “the other side is wrong”, the first group will win. No matter how much you want to believe that logic and reason will win out over emotional rhetoric, it doesn’t. </p>
<p>There is only one way to combat this ridicule, and that is to ridicule back, harder. We are mostly the target of insults, but there is a more powerful and intelligent form of ridicule and that is mockery. To mock is to not even take your opponent seriously, they are beyond reproach. The reaction that Alinsky speaks of is trying to make a serious good faith argument in response to ridicule, it is infuriating, it is ineffective. When you see the absurdity surrounding coronavirus and lockdowns, take it to it’s extreme, satirize it. They straw man us? Turn them into an absolute caricature. This especially applies to real life interaction, when comments are made in passing. In our day of socially enforced groupthink, where the average person is much more concerned with virtue signaling for status and acceptance than they are with the truth, offhand mockery is more effective than serious debate and it is safer. It is easy to say on the internet that you will always stand up for the truth no matter the consequences, but that is just naive, take it from someone who was literally run out of academia and many social circles, it is not an effective tactic to be the martyr dying on the hill of truth. </p>
<p>When the game gets dirty, whoever mocks harder wins.</p></p>

        <p>My favorite one is "maskie". I once had a wild Karen appear to tell me to put on a mask while at the park. </p>
<p>All I said was "What do you want, maskie? No. I'm fine. I'm not sick" she left. </p>
<p>Imagine a person who has to wear a mask to feel safe. Thats what a maskie is. They're weirdos.</p>

        <p>I love that! I'm not a fan of the doomer epithet at all, it only captures the catastrophizing when that barely scratches the surface of what we are up against, we need better epithets. Maskie is actually mockery, doomer is not.</p>

        <p>"Dystopioid" is another one I heard somewhere. Kinda like doomer. But someone who mindlessly goes along with a dystopian future like a pre-programmed robot.</p>

        <p>After battling bad-faith doomers on this sub and elsewhere online for months, I've come to the same conclusion myself. Even if they say they want to argue in good faith, they don't. They're either coming here to mock, ridicule and bully you - to which feel free to do the same back - or they're coming here to jerk themselves infront of you and need an audience, so ignore them.</p>
<p>I used to spend hours researching the best scientific evidence to cite against them but they don't read it, discredit it, mock it and then claim <em>they</em> have all the science because they are on the side of "good" so they don't <em>have</em> to listen to anything I say.</p>
<p>Now I will only argue with basic logic, not evidence. e.g. If you can't see with your own eyes that in a picture of a man sitting by himself on a beach that he is not a harm to anyone without a peer-reviewed paper telling you so, then there is no hope for you anyways and I will not be wasting my time. </p>
<p>You wouldn't argue with a frothing at the mouth crazy person on the street because you know it's a lost cause, it's the same with the doomers who come here. Their acute level hypochondria has effectively made them lose their minds so there's equally no reasoning with them as there's no reasoning with a crazy person.</p>
<p>If they're bad faith, call them out.</p>
<p>If they're incapable of reason, ignore them.</p>
