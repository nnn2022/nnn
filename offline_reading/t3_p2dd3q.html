    <strong>Is honest conversation even possible anymore?</strong>
    <p><p>Hey folks, I just discovered this community yesterday. I don't normally post and although my account is not that new, I have been on Reddit since around 2010. I have seen different things happen here where public discourse has been both positive and absolutely toxic. I experienced this yesterday.</p>
<p>Years ago, I remember when people were outraged that certain businesses were starting to make healthcare decisions for their employees by preventing them from getting certain medicines through their company provided insurance. The outrage was palpable. I was part of the outrage.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since then. I have become a significantly less triggered person and have come to accept others' opinions, even if I don't agree with them. I don't have the need to tell someone they are wrong. They have the right to be wrong and I respect that.</p>
<p>I am starting to get seriously concerned about the state of discourse online. The internet is becoming an echo chamber of angry people with half-baked opinions who are unwilling to tolerate an opinion that is different from theirs.</p>
<p>Full disclosure, I've had COVID. My father had COVID. My grandfather died of COVID. My other grandmother had COVID too, but she is still alive and doing well. I understand that we have to take certain precautions, but you cannot take away people's freedoms just because they might get sick for a little while. Now you cannot even question the narrative of the media or you're labeled as a crazy person.</p>
<p>I'm not anti-vaccine because I go with the science. That being said, I am very grateful for all of the medicines that are available to us to treat all sorts of diseases. But I'm not for forcing medicines on anyone, anymore than I am for withholding medicines. Are we really at the point where we are willing to squash the right of others in the name of giving us back  our freedoms?</p>
<p>I've seen this movie before when I was 15 years old in 2001. We voluntarily gave the US government the unilateral ability to spy on us in the name of National Security. People want to know what freedoms are being taken away from us now. I'll give you a hint, if you get vaccinated you can go places again, ie: you can have your freedoms back.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do, but I refuse to engage with everyone in the same toxic manner that I was treated in the other subreddit. Please remember that you're dealing with other human beings. When they lash out, they're doing it from a place of fear. Meet them with kindness. Just as them lashing out will not change your mind, they will not respond positively if you lash back. Bring them to your level by asking them questions to clarify their position. Do not tell them they are wrong.  Either you will learn something from them, they will change their opinion, or you will begin building a conversation and cultivate respect between each other.</p>
<p>We will get through this with kindness, not with hate and insults.</p>

        <p>I've all but given up trying to have a dialogue with people outside of this sub.. every time I get on another sub (if I even can because I'm banned fookin' everywhere) and talk to someone about covid, I'm immediately downvoted to oblivion, called a Trump supporter (I'm not), an anti-vaxer (I'm up to date on everything but covid), or a a selfish prick. (Yup, I've asked nothing of you, but I'M selfish, but here you are asking everyone to bow down to government.)</p>
<p>It sickens me where the internet has gone. I wouldn't call myself left or right, just simply anti-big-government, but somehow they have this image of who I am just for stating a single opinion. The dichotomy runs DEEP in people's heads and I fear they will never let it go.. I JUST DON'T WANT GOVERNMENT OVERREACH INTO MY PERSONAL RIGHTS AND BODILY AUTONOMY, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?</p>

        <p>People don't understand that when you give the government power, that power persists after your preferred president has long left the office.</p>
<p>Your first paragraph damn near exactly describes my feelings. </p>
<p>Try telling anyone that Fauci was responsible for getting Gain-of-Function research re-funded in 2017 thru the research foundation in Wuhan. People do not want to hear that and will tell you that you're a moron. I guess I'm a moron. This is beyond politics. I'm so sick of people making this a left vs right argument. To stick within those bounds is to completely miss the point.</p>

        <p>Yes. I have reached exactly 1 person through polite dialogue and he didn’t even come to see the truth*, just decided to look into it. </p>

        <p>I'm hesitant to even use the term "our side" because it further divides us, but I get your point. It's just about respecting each other. If we don't the divide could run through us for decades.</p>

        <p>Yes! Thank you, this sentiment is exactly why I oppose any “group rights” (women rights, gay rights, etc.). This just divides us into us vs them and tends to lead to dehumanization of the “other”. The only rights are human rights. Are you a woman? Cool you get human rights. Are you a bisexual trans male? Cool you get human rights. Are you a straight white male? Cool you get human rights. There is only one “team”, the human team.</p>

        <p>We're all talking about human rights anyway. We don't need to shout down groups that are advocating for themselves only. We all have goals we're looking to achieve. They can choose to use labels, I'm choosing empathy.</p>
<p>FWIW, I think you mean that you're rejecting specific labels, not "group rights." It's a small distinction that will be lost on most.</p>

        <p>It's a tricky situation. But here is the short explanation.</p>
<p>He was 95 when he died. His only underlying health condition was high blood pressure. His wife of almost 70 years died about two weeks before he caught COVID. By the time he said he was sick, it was clear that he was sick for days. I think he lost the will to live.</p>
<p>That being said, he was given anti-body infusions and my cousin, who is a nurse, was in charge of his care and was updating the family the whole time. It's a sad situation, but he lived a long and extremely prosperous life and spent his last days being cared for by his own family. He was one of four siblings. He had four children, ten grandchildren and two great grandchildren. His story is not one of tragedy and my family will celebrate his life for years to come.</p>

        <p>NYC is already requiring immunization starting August 16th.</p>

<p>This is the first step to the government destroying businesses. I normally lurk on another sub that is exposing fuckery in the financial markets. They have the "receipts" and see a crash coming. Now we're going to make it worse by telling businesses that they must refuse service to customers based on "medical conditions." They will reap what they sow.</p>

        <p>I recently watched a video of a dude showing the effects of the pandemic in dt NYC.. its like a ghost town, but with stores. So many vacant spaces. </p>
<p>And now on top of it, they want to limit the customer base further by prohibiting unvaccinated customers lol its like only a matter of time before all that's left are the large chains.. HMM seems like they wanted it that way!</p>
<p>Also.. a large portion of the unvaccinated in NYC are people of color.. so they are gonna get to be racist too while they are at it!</p>
<p>Talk about killing 2 birds with stone.</p>
