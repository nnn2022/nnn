    <strong>Virtual School is a Disaster</strong>
    <p><p>First day of virtual school for my elementary school aged kid today, and it is a huge disaster in every regards. Just need to vent a little bit . How anyone thought this was a good idea is beyond me, and how anyone thinks this is even commiserate with the minimum standards necessary to call it education is grossly negligent.  Some highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some kids are working from ipads, some from computers.  The virtual meeting program, Teams has different functionality on computers than ipads. For example, on the computer, some kids can change backgrounds, raise virtual hands, etc. On the ipad you cannot.  Not being able to complete basic teacher instructions is completely frustrating to 6 year olds.  Lots of kids felt left out because they could not raise their "hands" in class.</li>
<li>Also, the teachers did not know how any of it worked, despite the school system saying they were engaged in teacher technology training for the past week. </li>
<li>Indeed one kid broke down in absolute tears because he could not raise his virtual hand in class.   The teacher had to stop the class for five minutes to console him.</li>
<li>Kids cannot figure out the mute button. Neither can teachers. </li>
<li>Teams only allows 9 screens to display at a time.  So students and the teacher can never see the whole class at once (they knew this was the case, and still proceeded with Teams anyway, wtf!). </li>
<li>Virtual gym. </li>
<li>One girl blew a whistle the whole time. One girl played with legos. Some kid was hungry, went and got a banana and came back to eat it for 10 minutes while everyone watched. </li>
<li>One kid was broadcasting from a hotel room while his family was on vacation. </li>
<li>My son hated every minute of it. Tried to turn it off several times because it was scary seeing his friends but not able to talk with them in person.  Therapy bills are going to be off the charts. </li>
</ol>
<p>Just the simple fact that someone in the school system okayed any of this is beyond the pale.  Just needed to vent, as it seems like no one is talking about this at all.</p></p>

<p>Children crying in frustration in front of their computers because they feel lost in the “new normal” is NOT what we need more of. That is not learning. </p>
<p>They are ruining an entire generation of children with this madness. </p>
<p>They didn’t choose this nor should they have to pay with their educations for the insanely hysterical measures being taken by adults to “protect” them.</p>
<p>Edit: the full caption on that photo reads “he was so frustrated he couldn’t stop crying”. </p>
<p>Also, I would have been the kid who went to get a banana. Fuck this shit. The whole thing is bananas.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty pissed at my sister right now. She could be homeschooling. She doesn't work. She HAS the time to choose to put her kids first, but no. She enjoys her "alone" time too much.</p>
<p>I'm just the aunt who would take a bullet for either one of the kids. I don't get a say.</p>

        <p>My sister in law and brother aren't exactly enjoying "alone" time, but I, as an aunt who absolutely loves my niece and nephew, relate to your comment. </p>
<p>I miss being able to interact with them so much; my niece has CF and I understand a bit more why her parents are isolating her out of fear of the virus. However, my brother travels for work and, after each work trip, is quarantined to their basement for two weeks. I find it so disturbing that he won't even just go get tested each time--he'd rather be in the basement, not interacting much with his family for two week stretches fairly often. It's crazy and it breaks my heart that my niece and nephew are growing up in that situation.</p>

        <p>He gives the excuses that tests aren't reliable and give false negatives, and that even if he tests negative the virus may just not be at a detectable point at the time of testing. To my knowledge, he's not ever even looked into getting tested. I wouldn't necessarily encourage testing, especially for those who don't have symptoms, but both my parents got tested, with negative results. Even I literally just went today to get a test because I, too, travel for work and am not allowed at a site next week without a negative test result. So, really, I don't understand his thinking in his situation.</p>

        <p>Yeah, the kids are old enough now that they should not be struggling along as a one-income household. If they could afford to keep doing that, great, but they really can't. My brother-in-law won't put is foot down about it, even though the financial stress is slowly killing him.</p>

        <p>Yeah. The problem is that the parents struggling the most with this are two-income families. That isn't an option for so many. The modern workforce (and thus the economy) is built on the assumption that schools do their job.</p>
<p>30 years or so ago, before middle class income stagnation made multi-income a necessity for so many, this would be a more universally practical approach. But now many families are trapped.</p>

        <p>I’d love to see a homeschool revolution. Pull all the kids out of this bullshit public school system. Drain the schools and fire the ridiculous self pitying teachers.</p>
<p>Teach your kid in person, one on one, for 2-3 hours a day. Then let them play outside for the rest of the day. You can’t possibly tell me they’d learn LESS with a couple hours of actual one on one instruction than they would  in the zoom schools that have been detailed in this post and others. There’s just no way. And at least they will learn social skills and not develop skeletal/neck problems and eye problems and low grade anxiety and screen addiction.</p>

        <p>Also, single parents of young kids (and/or MOST mothers, married or not, of young kids) have already lost their jobs or delayed their careers because kids can’t watch themselves for zoom school; they need a caretaker. They’ve ALREADY altered their lives and lost income because of this.</p>
<p>So in that instance, pulling them from school so you don’t have to watch from the kitchen as you kid suffers and becomes a drone, and releasing yourself from the agony of being IT tech and be the in-person behavior enforcer for an unnatural video chat class, is preferable in my opinion. Food for thought.</p>

        <p>To be honest, it may save them. Our educational system teaches kids to retain information and recall it when necessary. It teaches them how to NOT think (one of our big problems right now). My hope is that we will rethink education and not just try to adapt it to online. </p>
<p>It’s Norway or Finland (or maybe both) that have like 4 hours of recess per day and all around less school than we do - and they outperform us.</p>

They don’t understand why they can’t see their friends, why they have to wear a mask, why they can’t be in the classroom, can’t have recess, etc. Raising our children to think they are threats to each other’s lives is so, so twisted and wrong.</p>

Basically it means if mommy gets sick,  she might have to live at the hospital for a little bit. Mommy's mom might have to live there too. </p>
<p>Do you remember when mommy had to live in the hospital for a couple days after surgery?  It would be a little longer. "</p>
<p>Hey kiddo,  remember when we talked about that disease going around.  I know how much you miss your friends,  but its gonna be okay.  We can play any game you want.  We only have a small yard,  but we can still color with chalk,  blow bubbles,  run around.  How about you pick a board game from the internet. I'll even let you pick out a special treat. "</p>
<p>Let them have a tablet (with parental locks,  or talk like this about the internet. Give them supervised access to talk to friends and family. Face time,   Its not that hard to be understanding </p>
<p>Doing short bursts of info is all it takes. Talk to your kids like this all the time.  Let them know they can talk to you about anything.  This is how you develop a good relationship. </p>

        <p>Ohohoho... Not surprising.</p>
<p>My mother is a teacher, and told me that her internet crashed several times on day one. Some kids would leave for a time, and others left and didn't come back. Some kids were clearly not at home, having to use the wi-fi in other public places. No focus on the lessons. It was a huge mess. This is for middle school, by the way.</p>
<p>Yet she says she hates it, and kids are probably not learning, but "there is a virus killing thousands of people a day, so we just have to put up with this for now." SIGH.</p>

        <p>I saw a story where middle school kids had to use Taco Bell wifi for school because they just don’t have the support they need at home. All of these social issues the doomers used to care about all went out the window once the virus came.</p>

        <p>I really wish people wouldn't generalize everyone working from home as supporting and enabling this...</p>
<p>My spouse is working from home, and is miserable, and hates everything going on right now. There's people here and at LDS who are now working at home, who've talked about how much they hate the lockdowns and "New Normal".</p>
<p>I've also known/witnessed essential workers who are terrified of the virus, and seem to support these measures as well. One lady on my block is a nutcase obsessed with "reducing the spread" and she's been working this entire time as a pharmacist at a Rite Aid... I also see lots of paranoid Nancys in my block who have "An Essential Worker Hero Lives Here" signs on their lawns.</p>

        <p>You’re right that I am generalizing. My perspective is mainly based on my own personal experience with people who WFH. Also a pharmacist or doctor is not the type of essential worker I am referring to. They can afford WiFi access for their children. I am talking about the delivery drivers and grocery store workers, etc. The people who exist on minimum wage.</p>

        <p>I agree with this and also I wish people would stop saying “homeschool your kid!” It’s like no.  I have a toddler and a school aged kid, I work part time and I have husband who works insane hours.  I school aged child loves schools and HATES virtual learning and does not do well being taught by me.  homeschooling is really not an option for a lot of people.  Traditional School is the most viable option for the most amount of people.  Just flippantly saying “homeschool your child” is just as obtuse as doomers pushing for virtual learning.  And yes homeschooling may allow for more flexibility if you have a child that enjoys that free fall but some of us don’t and our children like structure and friends and school activities.</p>

        <p>The ship that is education got torpedoed by the internet years ago. It’s been listing at 45 degrees for a while. COVID is a second torpedo - scuttled by the New World Order puppet masters. They just destroyed one of their information gates (media and government remain, but are not far behind) - weakening America is that important to them. </p>
<p>The internet has disrupted and is disrupting everything. Check out the Intellectual Dark Web and the likes of Jordan Hall for some interesting ideas. </p>
<p>We’ve chosen to homeschool. My wife was stressed out with managing all the kids’ grades and deadlines. Now she is in charge of everything (pros and cons) and we’re all happier than before. </p>
<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad says get an education in money, in business. The fundamentals are important - but after a certain point you can make a fine living without traditional education (I say this as a professor and PhD). Unless my kids want to do hardcore science I will encourage them to start multiple businesses instead of going to college.</p>

        <p>Some great quotes:</p>
<p>&rt; I follow a curriculum I pay for monthly so all I have to do is print the lesson and make the example. So I just don't do anything</p>
<p>&rt; I'm not planning too far ahead bc things could change at any moment. Once any particular grade is half way through a project I start planning the next one. So .y prep periods are often spent staring at my computer</p>
<p>&rt; Honestly, just be ok with creating the absolute minimum effort lessons.</p>

        <p>This is just really sad. My kids aren’t school age yet but I will homeschool them before I ever put them through this  bullshit. I realize that’s not an option for everyone though. </p>
<p>Also, I have a friend on Facebook who teaches at an elementary school and posts shit like, “It’s too soon to go back” and “Nobody even asked the teachers if they feel safe going back”. So I guess her school is virtual now and then going hybrid with a classroom full of plexiglass attached to desks (she posted pictures).   But YET- she never stopped posting pictures of her kids at the pool, playing with other kids at the park, going to restaurants, etc. Last night she posted a pic from happy hour! Someone tell me that I’m overreacting like a pregnant Karen who’s just jealous that she can’t have a glass of wine right now lol</p>
<p>But I have another friend who is older and more at risk who works at at school and was pretty much going to retire early if they made her go back (which they didn’t- school went virtual). However, I have a strong suspicion that she hasn’t even left her house since March (I’m glad that she has a big property with lots of land to get outside). So it is easier for me to respect  her viewpoint when she’s not being a hypocrite, even though I think all kids should have the option of going back to school.</p>

<p>Nobody asked "essential workers" either.  None of them had a choice. Why should teachers get that choice? Is the developmental well-being of our children less important than stay-at-home millenials being able to get takeout during a pandemic? This is what the doomers don't understand or care about.</p>

        <p>America should grow a spine and just fire every single teacher who won't go back. Same as those demanding masks and plexi glass and no play  - what are you all doing to your kids??? Children come first. Teachers who don't feel safe are idiots anyway. Kids spread the flu really well every flu season more than covid. The flu is more of a risk to many of working age, and even then it's minor, yet they've worked through that every year.</p>

        <p>If they are older than 65, they need to retire.  If they are younger, but unhealthy, have them teach then children of parents who want online school.  Everyone else needs to go back. This is ridiculous.  I’ve see grocery store clerks who looked over 65 and no one cared to help them stay home.</p>

        <p>&rt; My son hated every minute of it. Tried to turn it off several times because it was scary seeing his friends but not able to talk with them in person.  </p>
<p>this is torture for your child.</p>
<p>DON'T accept this. homeschool, or literally do nothing. if your child can read decently, tell him to read a nice fun fantasy book for all of the school time and ride around on his bike or something for an hour as sports class, or whatever else, that u think makes a lot more sense, than literal torture!</p>
<p>also microsoft teams is proprietary software from an evil company. so the school has no business using it and letting your child use it. it puts your child's privacy at risk, so there's another reason for u, to simply not accepting this madness.</p>
<p>you can teach a million times better than this setup of torture.</p>
<p>even if u only have half the time available, because u have to work to keep the lights on and food ready, u would still be a million times better.</p>
<p>get your boy to enjoy a book, or read a book together with him to get better at reading or hell do some basic math puzzles, if u want him to get better at math and again u'd be a million times better than the public school system, that now is openly torturing children.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yk3xezML8Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yk3xezML8Q</a>  (going into detail, that this is torture)</p>
<p>just turn that garbage off together with your child and tell him, that instead of this torture, u will do something fun and educational with him like again reading a fantasy story together with him or whatever else. that is just an option i brought up.</p>

        <p>Yep, figured as much. So they come up with alternate activities instead. Surprised that they didn't do anything health-related, though. I always thought that the health part of Phys Ed got short shrift. Not enough teaching about health concepts and too much playing sports.</p>

        <p>For years I've been a critic that physical education has been woefully lacking in public schools. Now with this COVID nonsense, it's just license for the teachers to do the bare minimum and get paid full salary. So glad my son is in 6th grade and still has time to recover after this nonsense is finished.</p>

        <p>This is why I pulled my kids from public
school, their last half of school was exactly this. Even after 4 months of virtual school, many of my friends/family are telling me what a shit show it is when they returned on the 1st. </p>
<p>My kids weren’t learning anything, at all. Nothing. It was a bunch of busy work coupled with everyone talking over each other amongst hearing dogs bark, babies cry, and TV’s on. Towards the end they were getting one virtual class and an email list of pointless assignments. </p>
<p>Homeschool is a lot of work, but my kids are able to focus so much better with hands on lessons/assignments than being on an iPad all day. So far the last few weeks of homeschool have far surpassed the 4 months on online nonsense.</p>
<p>Schools need to open and people can’t keep thinking kids are actually learning via this virtual method.</p>

        <p>No. The numbers do not even come close to requiring high school students (or college students) be cooped up in their homes all day instead of enjoying the prime of their lives in school. Move that ole Overton Window back where it belongs: reality.</p>

        <p>agreed...but you have older (obese?) teachers who are concerned.  Elementary - usually younger teachers.</p>
<p>how to address this conundrum. Maybe they work in a closed office and teach a classroom of kids via a big screen? Only the teacher is virtual in select instances. Most younger / middle aged teachers are ok.</p>

        <p>As I said in a similar sub, these teachers are in for a rude awakening when big corporations realize they could handle this better and start offering more professional remote learning options. Won't need local teachers anymore if they aren't in person. What'll they do? Strike?</p>

        <p>My wife teaches 5th grade.  I have 2 boys one in 8th grand and one is a freshman in high school. 2 different districts.</p>
<p>The schools are throwing teachers under the bus - "Teachers have been working all summer to get up to speed with the tech" - that is a load of crap.  They had a couple of 2-3 hour video training sessions that are about the equivalent of those stupid HR videos you have to watch for work.</p>
<p>In my wife's district, they are not allowed to mark a kid late. If a kid pops in for 5 minutes and then takes off for the day, they aren't allowed to mark them absent.  There is no way to hand our consequences for behavior issues, so the kids have zero accountability except for grades. She has 5th graders (10 years old) who just get up and walk away, won't unmute to participate, making phone calls on speaker in the middle of class while unmuted. Its chaos.</p>
<p>In my kids district, classes are supposed to be 40-55 minutes long. Most of the teachers have class for 10-25 minutes and then end the video. I work from home (since LONG before corona) and its insane to have my boys wandering around the house when they should be in school. </p>
<p>The whole thing is a joke.  My wife is torn between wanting to make sure she is doing her job and reaching these kids and wanting the entire thing to be a dumpster fire of failure so she can get back in the classroom and ACTUALLY reach these kids.</p>

        <p>My middle school aged daughter has to do half and half, so some days she goes to school in person, some days she is supposed to work through teams. Almost at the end of week two and I have learned (yesterday actually) that two of her teachers don’t post any assignments on teams. They put them on the school website. Nobody bothered to mention that shit to us when this started. “Everything will be through teams” is what we were told. So that was bullshit. There were supposed to be actual zoom calls for classroom lessons/instruction. That hasn’t happened either, as far as I know. They don’t have books. Two weeks into school, almost week 3, and they don’t have fucking books. This is so beyond stupid at this point. I’m honestly surprised that they haven’t just shut the whole shit show down and moved everyone to online learning through the edgenuity platform they are using for the fully online kids. I am probably going to switch her over to that because that may be the only way she actually learns anything this year. I’m so fed up with this crap. My elementary aged kid is allowed to go in person 5 days a week. She has 6 kids in her class so at least HER year is going to be great, plenty of teacher interaction. This whole situation is ridiculous.</p>

<p>You get told to "get 'er done" from all angles while some of these whiny fucking teachers literally sabotaged our entire return plans a week before school started..and now we are remote instead of half day.</p>
<p>No one can find daycare but we are just supposed to "get it done"..maybe lose our jobs, maybe lose our homes. Who cares right?</p>
<p>My son has an IEP and what he received from March to June was an absolute FUCKING JOKE and it's going to be more of the same I am sure.</p>

        <p>That’s rough. Maybe it’s for the best so the district will change course. They should at least have elementary school in person as an option. Schools that give the option have very high opt in rates. My kid’s school was like 85%, maybe more now. I’m paranoid my first grader’s school will end up shutting down but the superintendent is always the last one in the state to call a snow day so that’s assuring.</p>

        <p>I don't like virtual school and my kids really don't like it, but a lot of the blame for your issues is on the school and the other parents.  My kids school spent the summer training, purchased chrome books for every kid and gives wifi hotspots to those who don't have internet.  Classes are relatively orderly and often have a parent sitting in to mute kids or address their issues. It's still a shitty experience but we supplement with playdates, bike rides, etc</p>

        <p>i'm really sorry, elegant struggle - i wanted to say something funny about it to make you laugh, and then i wanted to say something corny, but you know what? that doesn't help you or your kids one jot. we don't have kids yet, so i can only imagine how heartbreaking this is for you as a parent. it's wrong, it's not okay - it's vile and unnatural.</p>
<p>you're doing your best, and that's all you can ask of yourself. perfect is the enemy of good.</p>
<p>you're being a good parent - when you feel like it's time to pull the plug on Teams and let your kids loose, do it. it sounds like no one is getting anything out this.</p>
<p>you know what your kids need the most - give it to them as much as you can. you know that kids learn so much through unstructured playtime, arts and crafts. fuck, throw a dance party with your kids in the living room and ask them what they thought about the music and why. watch a kid's movie and then talk to them about it. </p>
<p>your son will remember what a bad ass mom he had and how much he learned. parents are the best teachers at that age.</p>
<p>what the school boards and teachers are doing to a generation of children is a fucking war crime. don't let them forget it. and vote 'em out when you can. drag 'em - use their own words and actions against them.</p>
<p>your kids will be okay, and that's all you're being asked to do.</p>
<p>hugs, okay? we're all here for you. i'll bet that the No New Normal crowd could build an amazing, well-rounded, deliberate curriculum and lesson plan for your son.</p>
<p>i'll start with military history and strategy and into to diplomatic history and national security studies. i'd also like to call dibs on folklore and mythology. our first cultural appreciation activity will be a game of Risk and a night of ghost stories around the fire.</p>
<p>alright, who's next? we need some volunteers!</p>

        <p>I'm a middle school PE teacher. I am very computer/tech literate (which has helped A LOT with navigating distance learning). I can tell you, the experience students have in my class, versus this same time last year is quite worse. I was giving students a real quality PE education. Students were learning, having fun, running, growing, jumping, developing skills and learning to be part of a team. Students were learning leadership, responsibility, and how to work and play together. </p>
<p>Now...I teach them "about" sports. That's all I can do. Students do a fitness log. I wonder how much of their fitness log is made up (and that's only counting students who actually bother to turn it in). In short, its a joke. For reference I'm in California. I like the school I'm at, I like the district. I just became tenured and I though I would stay here a while. I've recently began looking at teaching jobs in other states which are opening up schools. Not much out there but I can't do distance learning much longer. I'm very active and am used to moving and playing with the kids. I feel bad for the students the most. This whole situation sucks.

        <p>I was a community college teacher for a short while, and it really drove home what's wrong with education.  </p>
<p>For a lot of (not all) students, learning isn't the goal.  It's to get the piece of paper.  They'd rather argue with you to get curved rather than put in the work to get the grade they want.  </p>
<p>It doesn't help that the system isn't set up to encourage the idea that knowing things is more important than the grade - it's why you learn things!  </p>
<p>So, yeah, it wouldn't surprise me if we, in another ten years, are dealing with a lot of entitled kids who "advanced" amid a crisis because people can't just say "despite all of this, you will still need to know things.  Now, shut up and sit down or else you'll be stuck in third grade for a few more years."</p>
