    <strong>Can't even vent anymore. No "Normal" At All! Has this happened to you?</strong>
    <p><p>Honestly? Just got a post removed as soon as  it was posted on f.t.m reddit  (a sub for mostly spoiled trans teens posting pix. I put periods between because they are crazy and will report anything with their reddit name). I'm sick of people policing what we say, what we do, and everything. Was it because I talked about my race? (Portuguese and black and irish btw) Because I swore? Who knows... I posted about a fucking beeotch (is that better, reddit modds?) who was discriminatory against my cis male partner, she wasnt even on the reddit, this was a real life experience, so it's not like I was trying to start drama.  I posted it under vent and ever put a trigger warning, but apparently you can't swear in their safe spaces anymore. So I left. This is why I hate when people know I'm a a trans guy, they think I'm like "them". Nope, I'm just a dude looking to live life, I just happen to have tiddies. Anyway, the revolution needs to start. Any leads in albuquerque? Because we all know <strong><em>that</em></strong> sub is full of righteous, self centered, weirdos. Had to leave the albuquerque subreddit too... just take a look at it, you'll love the brainwashing!! It's a fun read at least.</p>

<p>EDIT: The post wasn't deleted, just wasn't made public. So you can see the idiocy that went on if you go through my posts.</p></p>

        <p>Okay... how is this relevant to the sub? This sub is about venting/complaining about the current COVID hysteria, not bitching about subreddit mods.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you're right.</p>
<p>Though on a related note, it really astounds me how now people just do not care about issues relating to the mental and physical health of women, queer people, minorities, etc. I feel like the rights of these groups are going to be set back decades now because of this. It's like nothing matters except COVID (which has been mentioned many times in this sub and LDS), and a lot of the people who are allies and even a part of those groups basically go along with it. God, this whole thing feels like a bizarre nightmare, where people are actively giving up their rights and freedoms over the fear of a virus with less than 1% chances of dying.</p>

        <p>And not just that, some homeless shelters are closing their doors too and turning people away too because of this. And a lot of people aren't even volunteering anymore.</p>

        <p>Yes, I agree. Most people don't <em>really</em> care, and this whole mess makes that much more clear. I guess what really surprises me is the lack of this lip service anymore.</p>

        <p>Well, it doesn't relate directly.  I was really pissed when I wrote this, I guess I should have mentioned that I see so many similarities between lgbt groups (online or in person) and the current state of everything with covid. When you think about it, I guess the mentality is the same. I'm not sure if you've ever spent time in any queer or lgbt+ spaces, but it's so hive minded, and it reminds me of what's going on with the covid situation right now. Nobody will listen, everyone eats up ANYTHING presented to them, and they alienate everyone who deviates from whatever "norm" they have decided on. I should have said that, I was just angry, needed to vent to people.</p>

        <p>And when its all over, they will wonder "what happened". But as soon as someone tells the honest truth, they will dogpile the person to death.</p>
<p>They want comfortable excuses to their actions. You're not allowed to point out the elephant in the room.</p>

        <p>Haha that's true. I guess that's just how people are. Most people want to fit in, I don't even know if people truly have the opinions they say they have, or if it was just easy to fall into a group that will support each other.</p>
