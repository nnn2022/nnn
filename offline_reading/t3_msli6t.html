    <strong>I have compassion with the young ones who fall for the evil trickery of the rich boomers doing the great vaccination rollout now to wipe everyones memory covering up 50 years of environmental wrecking, 2000 years of feudal empire style dominations and 500 years of church supported colonialism</strong>
    <p><p>the young ones are not free at all ... since thousands of years is it stupid adults who believe that they have the right to force onto children what they should have to eat, wear, do at what time of the day and night ... childhood in human species is like a prison</p>
<p>previous generations have wrecked our environment so massively with dumping toxic nuclear radioactive garbage into the oceans, digging mining holes into earth many kilometres deep to rob the earth from minerals, metals, fossils just to waste it all by inefficient use of it, creating a throw away product cycle where products last not as long as they could would they have been engineered to last long ...</p>
<p>so it is understandable that the young ones are not sure anymore if their own body is capable enough to do all the cleaning of ones inner house / body work with all the environment wrecked by the boomer generation</p>
<p>this insecurity wether the body is capable or not to take on this coronavirus and learn from it ... is one reason why a youth / young one today is leaning towards giving in to the evil trickery of the boomers generation to cover up all the environmental wreckage done during the past 50 years as well as to just skip the whole reparation for colonialism and feudalism chapter ... what has not even yet been started really on the global awareness theater stage ...</p>
<p>basically ... what happens today is the ones who are sitting on wealth generated trough 2000 years of empire style feudalism, 500 years of church supported colonialism, who used the loot from all this abusive behaviour against their fellow human beings and nature to further go for the big hollowing out of earth taking all the gold, silver, copper, diamonds, oil, gas etc. they could grab during the last 50 years ...</p>
<p>and now when it seems that the young ones want this environmental wrecking to end and some reparations happening towards the indigenous people and the enslaved people abducted from africas ... brought to the americas against their wishes</p>
<p>now when the future voters are growing up knowing all these past atrocities</p>
<p>the rich boomers go for the final kill</p>
<p>wipe out everyones memory by hooking them up to first half yearly then eventually monthly up to perhaps weekly doses of vaccines</p>
<p>( because the vaccines can never fully cover all the mutations and the weaker people get by all the chemicals injected into them the less capable their immune system will be so they will rely more and more on more frequently updated new downloads coming from the pharmaceutical companies laboratories ... )</p>
<p>so ... what I am trying to say here ...</p>
<p>there is more to it than just the young ones being confused and giving in to this long prepared attack on every sort of freedom we ever had</p>
<p>there is more to it than the young ones not understanding how this series of lockdowns, threatening of quarantine, upstyling of vaccines as the ultimate sollution ... is the big kill attempt, the final countdown ... the end game ... of the very same generation what is not willing to do the necessary economic changes to wreck the environment more ... of the very same generation what was advocating for nuclear power generation even when it was long evident how toxic the leftovers are, how dangerous an accident at such a power plant is ... the very same generation who voted for politicians to get into office or stay in office who continued to use tax payers money to build an nuclear weapons arsenal with the potential to destroy, pulverise, blast to dust ... the planet several times over</p>
<p>because of all the reluctance of the boomer generation to do the right thing</p>
<p>some part of the young generation mistakenly believes that these abusers of today might one day stop climate change and use tax money to repare social unfairness of the past several hundred years</p>
<p>please do understand me in the way I mean it ...</p>
<p>I do not believe in taxes being coerced from anybody ... I do not believe that big governement is any good ... even if they would go 150 percent environmentally friendly and would use the coerced tax money to repair all the injustice what came from european people enslaving africans and stealing the land of indigenous people on turtle island</p>
<p>( a name for north america used by some indigenous groups )</p>
<p>even if they would do what they never intended to do ... as they are just the evil fuckers which they show themselves now openly during the great vaccination rollout ...</p>
<p>it would not be the correct way</p>
<p>seen from my viewpoint ... the only correct way how to repair environmental damage and how to heal intergenerational social abuse trauma coming from transatlantic slave trade, theft of lands of indigenous people ...</p>
<p>the only decent way this can ever work</p>
<p>is voluntarily</p>
<p>with everyone who wants to be part of the positive change ... doing voluntarily its very own part to help it</p></p>
