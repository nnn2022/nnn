    <strong>My Letter to Elected Representatives &amp; My First Response</strong>
    <p><p>Hello All!</p>
<p>Covid deaths in BC have been extremely low this entire pandemic and the already low number of Covid deaths in BC have dropped even lower in recent months with most days in the last few weeks reporting zero deaths.  How many millions of taxpayer dollars are being wasted on this?  Surely the province can come up with a better way to create jobs than creating a Covid industrial complex.  Perhaps building low income housing, job training, and counselling for our large homeless population would be a much better use of time and money.</p>
<p>We also need to put a stop to the media's relentless fear campaign, which is physiologically abusing Canadians on a daily basis.  If there had been no media coverage of the pandemic since January 2020 I would have had no idea anything was going on.  In my area our hospitals are a ghost town and no one I know at work or in my personal life has been sick.</p>
<p>Clearly covid has become endemic at this point.  We don't test for every single virus and Covid should be no different.  It is past time for the Province of BC to take the microscope off of Covid and start focusing on helping the residents of BC heal from this emotionally traumatic time and to encourage healthy diets and lifestyles for our residents of all ages.</p>

<pre><code>First Response I Received 
Thanks for your August 4th message expressing your views regarding our provincial government and media response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
</code></pre>
<p>I always find it intriguing how people assess situations differently based on their experience and world view. As a case in point, you assess COVID related deaths in BC as "extremely low", but I imagine the nearly 1800 families who have lost a loved one would see it differently. Your characterization of a media "fear campaign" would be seen, I believe, by the vast majority of citizens as vital information to assist people to stay safe through this challenging time. I can only imagine what it might be like living in a country without a free press where such information is kept from the general public.</p>
<p>I find your assertion that money is being wasted creating a "COVID industrial complex" as demeaning to the thousands of health care professionals, civic workers and others who have worked tirelessly under difficult conditions to assure our population remains as safe as possible. I am glad that no one you know has been sick, but the fact that we have remained relatively safe from the worst of the pandemic in the Comox Valley and north Island area is not, in my view,  evidence that there was nothing to fear but rather a testament to the ongoing efforts of those professionals and the citizenry at large to follow public health guidance and make sacrifices for the common good.</p>
<p>While I admire your role as an educational assistant and mother, you do not cite any medical or health sciences expertise in your analysis. As such, I suggest we continue to follow the advice of our dedicated pubic health experts while enjoying the progress we have made and looking forward to an eventual return to our pre-COVID lifestyle.</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p></p>
