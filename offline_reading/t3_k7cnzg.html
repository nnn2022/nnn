        <p>This has been a thing for as long as technology has been a thing. The  promise of "better living through technology" has always been a lie.</p>
<p>- The new machines (mills, steam power, assembly lines) were supposed to end toil and drudgery and usher in a new Utopia. Instead, they created an urban underclass of wage-slaves suffering in overcrowded tenement housing, working 12 hour days in appalling conditions.</p>
<p>- As a kid, I remember the beautiful concept drawings of Mach 5 supersonic transports that would whisk 500 passengers in comfort from New York to London in 3 hours. That trip now takes longer than it did on a Boeing 707 in 1970.</p>
<p>- We were promised a world where "empowered" women worked and our dual income households would raise our standard of living. Instead, real wages dropped to reflect the vastly increased labour pool, and the prices of everything (especially real estate) skyrocketed - to the point where a dual income is necessary just to survive.</p>
<p>- IT technology was supposed to provide lucrative jobs, reduce workloads, provide us the knowledge of the ages with a simple mouse click, and make us more social. Instead, it has made fewer people do more work, broken down the age-old separation from "work time" and "not work time", turned us into hermits, and served as a conduit for lies, propaganda, and cancerous advertising. All while the promised jobs got outsourced to Rajeev in Bombay.</p>
<p>- Now, our newest tech is literally being used to surveill, control, brainwash, and enslave us - and the slaves, instead of revolting as in the past, cheer and demand more and heavier chains!</p>
<p>I would happily give up Fecesbook, Twatter, "smart" phones, and the rest of our current "technology" and go back to circa 1980 - or maybe 1957...</p>

        <p>Fair. The chains forged by our masters still rested fairly lightly on everyone's shoulders at that point - at least until the fall of the Berlin Wall, Gulf War 1, and Bush's talk of a "New World Order".</p>
<p>Everyone often talks about 9/11 as a turning point - which it was. However, the handwriting was already on the wall with the whole "Y2K" scam. Governments had plans in place to squash civil liberties for that event, too. They just never got much airplay because the Internet wasn't as pervasive as it is now, and the "event" didn't play out as expected.</p>

<p>This fucking one. Feminism "liberated" women by devaluing labor so much that two people now have to work full time for less than a single wage earner used to earn. Ooops.</p>

        <p>Great analysis. I just spoke with my older family members about it and they all said: oh my you didnt know the 80s how great they were comparing to the shit we have know. The technology ruined jobs, ruined human relationships, ruined us in some way by constantly conditioning us like monkeys for profit. But hey there is always antidepressants if youre not feeling happy. </p>
<p>There was this serial killer who tried to warn the public of the dangers of technology and the way society is headed. Now, im not justifying his means, but in my opinion he had a point. Humans are not unidimensional creatures who are made to be happy in todays world doing highly specialized tasks and then consuming away the remains of their private time. </p>
<p>Add to that the surveillance, the censorship, god forbid the social credit scores or worse and honestly ill just pack up my shit and move to some self sustaining community because fuck this shit. Only a robot can tolerate such vapid existence and humans arent robots or arent made to be happy in robot like conditions.</p>

        <p>The Internet has been a massive boon for the spread of independent perspectives but also for the spread of propaganda. It's a double-edged sword. Case in point: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and Google by and large spread the power narrative about the coronavirus yet we're still here (for now) in a niche discussing opposition to it. We wouldn't have been able to do this prior to the internet but the dynamic is definitely asymmetric. Power has won over <em>far</em> more minds than opposition has been able to liberate using the same medium. It happened for radio and it happened for TV. It was always going to happen for the Internet as well.</p>
