<title>As the FDA in the US is a quango of Pharma insiders, the U.K. version, the MHRA (who approved the new Pfizer vaccine) is thoroughly exposed for its industry vested and conflicted interests...still considering this under-tested and rushed-to-market vaccine?</title>

<p>“From it, we see the new chairman, Mr Lightfoot himself, is a shareholder in giant vaccine manufacturer Glaxo Smith Kline. Two other members, Amanda Calvert and Anne-Toni Rodgers, are shareholders of AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, another huge vaccine manufacturer.”</p>
<p>And this is only what they have publicly revealed. In the revolving door world of industry and public private partnerships, perhaps their ultimate rewards will come when they step down from their roles in the MHRA.</p>
<p>Having side-stepped more stringent EU laws to expedite the rollout of the vaccine, one must wonder if these people - many of whom stand to profit directly and financially from their ‘impartial‘ decisions - and their products can be trusted.</p>
<p>Skipping steps and keeping the public in the dark about the true data and issues associated with the vaccines in general, and appealing solely to emotion, is not going to persuade anyone that we are heading in a positive direction here.</p>
<p>“A temporary authorisation of the supply of an unlicensed vaccine could be given by the UK’s licensing authority under regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations (see below). A COVID-19 vaccine would only be authorised in this way if the UK’s licensing authority was satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate the safety, quality and efficacy of the vaccine. ‘Unlicensed’ does not mean ‘untested’,’ says the Government.</p>
<h2>Another stupid decision</h2>
<p>That is weird. Either the MHRA approve the vaccine or they don’t. If they are satisfied it’s safe and efficacious, what stops them licensing it? It’s an authority. It authorises a license. How long does that take? Can you imagine a meeting during which the MHRA board agree to ‘authorise’ a medicine rather than license it? So it’s not quite safe and efficacious enough for a license but we’ll put our name to it all the same?</p>
<p><a href="https://mhrainspectorate.blog.gov.uk/2019/10/04/mhra-process-licensing-useful-information/"><strong>The MHRA blog says</strong></a>: ‘new applications typically take 90 working days to process.’ But surely they don’t have to take that long. If it really is that urgent, why can they not send the inspectors around a bit quicker and then have a Zoom meeting?”</p>
