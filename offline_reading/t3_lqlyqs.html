    <strong>Who remembers “Mission Accomplished” in 2003?</strong>
    <p><p>And what happened for 17 years after these infamous words? Everyone sees the eerily similar parallels with Covid and “2 weeks to slow the spread”...right? This isn’t going to end. </p>
<p>I wish I was awake 17 years ago like I am today.</p></p>

        <p>So you could've had people screaming at you about how "we needed to liberate" the Iraqis, ignoring the initial messaging of "taking Saddam's WMDs"?  As someone who WAS "awake" and paying attention back then like I am now, I can tell you it was very much the "two weeks to slow the spread" of its time.    And no one had an answer for "If we're worried he has and will use those weapons, why send in an army for him to use them on?".  </p>
<p>The hell of it is that the social banishment I took back then is probably what's kept me sane through this one; I'd likely be having a much rougher time if I hadn't been through it all before.  That war started with only about 50% public support; I shudder to think what's going to happen to those of us defying the no normal without the armor of prior experience.</p>
