        <p>I honestly don’t care if I get downvoted on this:</p>
<p>Child trafficking- 1.2 million children trafficked per year, not even killed- obviously there are laws and regulations, such as the TVPA, which was the first federal law to address all types of trafficking, including children. They also focus on the protection for survivors, as well as prosecution for traffickers</p>
<p>War deaths- Between 2006-2020, a recorded 17,645 people have died from war, including self inflicted and even accidents- “A conscientious objector is an <em>individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform military service</em>” -Wikipedia. So people have have the right not to fight in wars, and while I definitely agree that people aren’t just a statistic, the deaths are far less than Covid.</p>
<p>Obesity deaths-2.8 million recorded deaths a year- This one is definitely a problem, but it has also been worked on for quite a while. There are plenty more ways to protect people against deaths from obesity since it was discovered in 1950. On the WHO official website, for example, I count 60 separate articles listing solutions for obesity deaths.</p>
<p>Flu deaths-250k-500k deaths per year- flu shots lmao</p>
<p>Starvation deaths-9 million deaths per year-  If you just look up “What is being done against starvation,” you will get hundreds of thousands of results. People have been trying for years and years to help against starvation, so I don’t think a photo of a man yawning really fits?</p>
<p>And Suicide Deaths-800,000 recorded deaths per year- people have been trying to help people with suicidal tendencies as well. Again, for years and years.
Now, look up “what is being done against suicide.” 285 million results. It’s not that people don’t care, it’s that it isn’t nearly as preventable. You can’t give someone a vaccine and suddenly they have the will to live.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has had about 3 million deaths worldwide. Yea it isn’t as much as starvation, but the point is that people are trying to help, and for some things, say flu deaths, we have to prioritize what’s more important.</p>
<p>Anyways yeah enjoy your day sorry you had to read all that</p>
