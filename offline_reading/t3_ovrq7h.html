        <p>No, the source said 76% of cases are spread from people who are presymptomatic.  Vaccinated vs unvaccinated is irrelevant in that stat. Is that the number you're talking about?</p>
<p>The point is that out of 100 people, there will be 5x the number of unvaccinated people that are symptomatic vs vaccinated. If symptomatic or presymptomatic people spread the virus more, then that's an important factor to consider when determining who spreads the virus more.</p>

        <p>Why are you talking about people who don’t catch Covid? Obviously OP is saying <strong>if</strong> they catch Covid, they’re less likely to know they have it therefore are less likely to change their behavior (not quarantine), thus are more of a danger to other people.</p>

        <p>Because the overall risk should obviously factor in those that would have been sick had they not been vaccinated. As we know, symptomatic people are more likely to spread it anyway.</p>

        <p>so the basic answer is that the vaccine limits the severity of symptoms.  people with the vaccine have been told they can more or less go back to normal, and even worse that they almost certainly can't get covid (up until the last couple of days the liars were claiming 95% efficacy for preventing infection).   They are subject to no or fewer restrictions.</p>
<p>So these people are SYMPTOMATIC but chalk it up to seasonal allergies, colds spreading because people hadn't been exposed to colds as often, etc.  Tons of sources on this.  Those SYMPTOMATIC people don't get tested (even if they wanted it it's difficult to obtain without serious illness), and go on about their lives, SPREADING the DISEASE, where an unvaccinated person would be getting tested, isolating, bedridden, etc.  That's the issue that you're apparently too fucking obtuse to acknowledge. They also spread the disease in the PRE-SYMPTOMATIC phase.  </p>
<p>and yes, you're remarkably obtuse and incredibly credulous for someone who is asking for SOURCES for something that you should be able to figure out using simple analytical thought.  how many times have they changed the % protection and you're still here quoting the latest like its a fact.  that's hilarious and quite an indicator of an adherent to the "i fucking love science" religion.  no matter how many times the backtracking happens you just take it on faith that this time they're not just pulling a statistic out of their ass and using limited data in bad faith.  quoting the CDC like its some indisputable source considering their track record over the last 18 months just makes you a joke.  You're not intelligent at all, just naive and credulous.</p>
<p>what is the source that 40% of people are asymptomatic?  Have you read that source?  how did they derive the data?  what was the pcr test threshold used to determine that those people were in fact asymptomatic and covid positive?  how were the people selected?</p>
<p>how did they determine that the supposedly asymptomatic people were less infectious?  was it the level of virus in the nose?  what measures were taken to ensure that these people were not simply false-positives derived by pcr testing with thresholds that were too high?</p>
<p>Step back and consider that you're nowhere near as intelligent as you believe yourself to be, and your high priests have at best failed you, if not outright duped you.</p>

<p>And I stop reading because you start of with a misleading assumption.  It provides your body with an immune response to COVID. Most people fight off the virus completely and never become infectious.</p>

        <p>Fuck it, I'll keep reading</p>
<p>&rt;where an unvaccinated person would be getting tested, isolating, bedridden, etc. That's the issue that you're apparently too fucking obtuse to acknowledge. They also spread the disease in the PRE-SYMPTOMATIC phase.</p>
<p>Why is it obtuse to acknowledge that there are about the same number of asymptomatic cases among the unvaccinated? Or that MOST of the spread is among pre-symptomatic people because they have a higher viral load? </p>
<p>Just to be clear, I acknowledge the risk you're talking about, but it OBTUSE to ignore the greater risk of spread among unvaccinated people.</p>
