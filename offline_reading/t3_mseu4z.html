    <strong>if they must go trough with it ... let them have their "vaccinated only" circles ... as long as we can have our "everyone welcome" circles</strong>
    <p><p>i am a coward in physical life</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>i hate confrontations and to a certain degree i could consider myself addicted to social harmony</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>that is how i have spent the last 10 years to great parts on the internet writing and otherwise depicting my visions of how i wish human society could evolve</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>now about this so called vaccination passport</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>i have allready written about it partly when i wrote some days ago that i was partly relieved to read about the WHO to not fully support the introduction of the vaccination passport</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>my personal oppinion is that vaccines all in all are not a good thing, that they bring more damages than benefits and its the same attrocity like child-baptism to vaccinate a child or a mentally challenged person against its consent</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but then ... if people really are dedicated to go trough with this, create a society where</p>
<p>only the ones who wear the mark of the monster can travel, shop and congregate ... why stand in their way</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>let them have it, let them have a go at it, let them fullfill their fantasy of segregation, their self-justified circle of the ones baptised by the pharmaceutical companies injecting a chemical cocktail in their bloodstream</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>just one meagre question i may ask ... let us who for sure never will want to join your</p>
<p>vaccinated only circles ... let us make our own circles</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>please do not block our lives completly so we have no chance to travel, no possibility to shop or congregate</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>please, if you absolutly must go trough with your chemical circle scheme ... let us who</p>
<p>trust more in our own cellular intelligence than into the intelligence of the brain of someone who cooks up a vaccine connoction in a laboratory ... let us who would any day</p>
<p>take on any virus and bacteria because they are our friends and not our enemies ...</p>
<p>let us create our own virus and bacteria friendly circles where everyone is allowed</p>
<p>to congregate, vaccinated or not</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and then let us see</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>which circles succeed, which social networks in physical space manage to satisfy their</p>
<p>users and how we possibly can each one in its own belief systems continue to both follow our trust into what we want to trust:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the ones believing  in vaccines trusting in pharmaceutical industry spending time in the vaccine only circles</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the ones believing in the bodys ability to self-heal all challenges and not willing to bet</p>
<p>ones wellbeing on pharmaceutical industry, the ones who like to be friends with viruses and bacteria trusting that they have our human beings best interest in their program ... we would set up then our own circles where everyone would be welcome what ever they would choose to shoot into their venes ahem whatever substances they would choose to inform their cellular body intelligence with</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>mmmh...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>additional to all of the above</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>i live in the geographical space what today is occupied by the nation state of switzerland, I was born in the town of st.gallen around 45 years ago.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>as i wrote before of me being shy to engage myself in physical life confrontations,</p>
<p>i am very reluctanct to engage in local political non-digital activities</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>i tried it 20 years ago but i was not able to go trough with it</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>since about 3 months i stopped following the daily news from the region where i live</p>
<p>it just gave me too much pain to read all the time what or what not the federal council, these 7 people who are elected by the few hundred national representatives sitting in the</p>
<p>national parliamentary assembly ... what these 7 people abusing emergency law now more or less constantly since about a year ... would have had the graciousness to let us 8.4 million fellow people let do with each other ... wether we were allowed to meet together</p>
<p>to drink a hot or cold beverage in a public place or watch a movie on a big screen, wether or not we would be allowed to dance together</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>even to write this is surreal ... like ... what ... 7 people decide what 8.4 million people can do or can not do together</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>what is this , a horror movie, some sort of political nightmare ?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>anyway ... i just could not take it anymore</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>some days ago then i wondered what my fellow people in switzerland would be up to</p>
<p>regarding the vaccine passport stuff</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and it was a desaster</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>in one article i read from middle of march 2021 there was basicly all the political parties except for one going along with the idea of vaccine passports for the schengen - space , the wider political space where the european union and switzerland have agreements</p>
<p>for regarding border controls</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>and the one party opposing the idea of a vaccination passport is the party what is</p>
<p>traditionally the party what has values like not wanting to invite refugees into switzerland, rejecting people who ask for help, give less support to people who ask for</p>
<p>social wellfare finances ... the party who basicly is full of people i really do not want to be with because i do believe it being of utmost importance for the healing of the human psyche that we welcome refugees as much as we are able to, that we help anyone who asks for help, that we support anyone who ask for social wellfare finances</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>mmmh... how to end this writeup here</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>ah ja</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>that is how:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>i would like once more to propose a most simple way out of this madness what we human beings experience at this moment ... a way what could be described in three simple steps:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1 ) pharmaceutical and surgical quick fixes never work fully... they mostly weaken the natural immune systems self-healing capacities</p>
<p>anyone who is abusing emergency laws to divert people s attention away from their own self-healing capacities and towards the pharmaceutical /surgical medicine business makes itself a complice towards a dehumanising depopulation agenda what envisions the avarage citizen as complying with every chemical/pharmaceutical business furthering political regulation, feeding itselve voluntarily with health-deteriorating sterilising toxic chemicals</p>
<p>to insist on freedom of movement, freedom of assembly being most important for body autonomy</p>
<p>( to be able to choose at all times where to be with whom is an essential requirement for supporting ones body fitness wellness ) equates opposing global guidelines locking down/phasing out individual personal sovereign behaviour</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>lockdown, masks, vaccines</p>
<p>bad</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>free movement, free assembly, body autonomy</p>
<p>good</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>2 ) regional state and nation state dominating the local community ( village/town/city ) = bad</p>
<p>sollution: renewal of states constitutions so that all political hierarchies get dissolved and all political decision powers get shifted towards the local community, abdication of regional and nation state in favor of the local community receiving full absolute sovereignity</p>
<p>the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adults being permanent residents of the local community, each one with the very same weighted voting power, creating, maintaining and interpreting the laws what are valid within the territory of the local sovereign community</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>3 ) once the local community has become its own absolute sovereign, it might use the inherited material and financial wealth of the abdicated regional and nation state to buy agricultural and forest land from private owners ... with the intention to redistribute land towards everyone who does not have private wealth</p>
<p>a lifetime loan of 1000 m2 without tax duty without rent duty envisioned for every human being on earth so that everyone may be free of having to serve anyone else, so that everyone may be free to build its own house with its own hands and grow its own vegan foodstuffs</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>-------------------------------------</p>
<p>------------------</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but how could we fullfill step 2, how could be possibly renew the constitutions of regional and nation states so that all political decision powers would reach the local sovereign community</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>possibly using concepts like:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state</p>

        <p>also now it seems that these upvotes have vanished ... its now back to 0 ... so I guess there are some other people who either don't like the content of my text and or the design, the style of how I like to write, how I like to present stuff</p>
<p>which I think its fair enough</p>
<p>I can take it</p>

        <p>very well possible that 6 eyes seeing and approving could translate like ... 6 personalities agreeing with it ... mmmh... thinking here along concepts of multiple personalities in one body, left and right part of the brain</p>

<p>why do we have that, why do we have two of all these ... two hands, two eyes, two legs, two brain parts, two genders ... and then people wonder why some people get confused at times not being able to harmonise the multiple parts of their selves very well ...  </p>

        <p>the thing with the apocalypse is ... there is this book ... called "bible" ... many people have abused much of it, forced this books content onto others and this way actually done the most opposite of the love and forgiving thing </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there is somewhere a chapter describing an apocalypse...   a sort of end of time scenario where society would structure itself so only those who wear the sign of the beast could participate</p>
<p>that is how I think its a good thing that these "vaccination passports" are being so openly pushed ... for everyone to see what is the intention around demanding everyone wearing the "mark of the beast" ... its both the vaccine but also the document / software / code / badge what informs about the vaccine being injected into the body of this person who shows this document / software / code / badge  </p>
<p>its like ... yes ... bring it on, let us get it done and over with so we can finally start building up this paradise where all of this segregation is done with, where we have gone trough with it and found it not really working </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>at least that is how I guess it will go ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>at first ... huge numbers of people signing up for the vaccines, the vaccinated only circles a huge sucess</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but then after a while when the bodies are being pumped full of that chemical stuff at ever shorter intervals and more and more people start to suffer from the toxic buildup  </p>
<p>the "everyone welcome" circles will become the places to enjoy some relaxed and all inclusive atmosphere</p>
