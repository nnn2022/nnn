    <strong>PSA: If your employer is forcing staff to get the COVID-19 shot or else resign, DO NOT turn in your two week's notice or otherwise quit; you will be ineligible for benefits and legal compensation.</strong>
    <p><p>As it stands, many employers are currently attempting to deceive their workers by forcing employees to "quit" rather than be "fired." </p>
<p><strong><em>If you willfully quit, you will be denied unemployment benefits, and seeking recompense or future settlements will be much more difficult.</em></strong></p>
<p>You <strong>do not</strong> have to turn in a two week's notice. This is a professional courtesy and is expected when seeking a recommendation for future employers. If your current employer is forcing vaccinations under threat of losing a job, there not going to be a good reference for you in the future. </p>
<p><strong><em>Make your place of employment fire you and save all records of communication which indicate that they are mandating the experimental COVID shot.</em></strong> </p>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction (and future fallout from the shot as we learn more about its effects), you may have the legal grounds to pursue compensation from your employers. </p>
<p>Many HR departments are intentionally misleading their employees. Do not quit your job, no matter what lies they tell you.</p></p>

        <p>My boss was vocally unhappy with me when I revealed in casual conversation that I won't be getting the jab. He backed off, and then one day he randomly asked me what I would do if it became a requirement to keep my job.</p>
<p>I just told him that if he does go that route, make sure I have the reason for my termination in writing.</p>
<p>He dropped the issue pretty quickly.</p>

        <p>I’m blessed to work for a small (~200 employees) family owned business that actually seems to care about its employees.</p>
<p>I had some people on Reddit try to dox me one time over a comment I made, it was nice knowing that if they succeeded and got a hold of my employer I’m confident both my boss and the owner of my company would have used the word “snowflake” before hanging up on whoever called.</p>

        <p>Yea my last job was for a huge, publicly traded company that has fully embraced woke culture. Which was part of the reason I left, but it mostly was just a toxic work environment with insane expectations for little reward. </p>
<p>It was a small pay cut at first, but I was quickly promoted at the smaller company and now make double what I did before and have a much better work/life balance and work for better people.</p>

        <p>Yeah stick with the smaller company, you will be better off. Glad to hear things worked out. I am politically homeless now, but a leftist, I am sick of "woke" culture. They definitely are frolicking while the boat is sinking. One isn't allowed to talk about anything real in those circles.</p>

        <p>They legally CANNOT MANDATE IT OR BE A REQUIREMENT FOR EMPLOYMENT  </p>
<p>Under NUREMBERG CODE if they FORCE A VACCINE it is a WAR CRIME.... And punishable to the fullest extent of a war crime...  </p>
<p>Not to mention HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY RIGHT TO YOUR PRIVATE HEALTH HISTORY....  </p>
<p>Whenever i request sick time at my job THEY CANNOT ASK WHAT FOR because it FALLS UNDER HIPPA VIOLATIONS... if i say i'm sick for a day i'm sick for that day...  </p>
<p>Nothing happens... NOW if it's 3+ days of sick time the a doc note is required...  </p>
<p>BUT VACCINES CANNOT BE FORCED ON PEOPLE especially as a condition of employment....</p>

        <p>You reference the Nuremburg Code in relation to employment as if it is legally binding in any country, let alone the US. You can be fired for most anything here, especially in a right to work state. The Nuremberg Code excuse is a favorite of Facebook kooks, which you seem to be duped by.</p>

        <p>Please look into your local "small claims court."</p>
<p>It is unbelievably easy to sue someone there and it creates a lot of discomfort for them because they are not allowed to use a lawyer. They must represent themselves. If you get lucky and they are visibly irritated with the judge, you'll see them reprimanded and embarrassed. It is an incredible experience to force someone who has wronged you through this.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario -- you put them through a stressful event. Best case scenario, you win the case and get \~$5k to $7k depending on your state limits.</p>
<p>The cost to serve someone and file a small claims suit is usually \~$80-$160 TOTAL. </p>
<p>Before going into court you'll face a negotiator that attempts to get you to compromise to settle out of court. I recommend facing a judge, but if you're in desperate need of money sometimes you might want to accept what is offered.</p>
<p><strong>My point is -- the court system exists. Make it work for you, for once. Use it against your employer.</strong></p>

        <p>Note: In the UK, do not use the small claims court, it's the wrong place to settle this kind of thing - do use an employment tribunal (which costs about the same) instead.</p>

        <p>While the other respondent is correct, broadly speaking, in most European countries, if you are dismissed for anything other than gross misconduct (which refusing a vaccine, is not), the employer must provide your contractual notice and as most would rather die than see you in the office after sacking you, you get paid the full amount while being placed on "gardening leave".</p>
<p>I once forced an employer to pay out a 3-month notice clause, a week after taking up a job with them, I resigned because they'd lied about the scope of work, they told me they didn't want me to stay, I pointed out they had insisted on the insane notice period, and if they wanted me to leave early, they had to pay it out, and they did, including the holiday pay that I'd have earned on that time too. :-)</p>

        <p>still a good idea to record conversations because very few people have total recall.  Even if it's inadmissible in court it can be damn useful in a deposition.  Source: I recorded phone calls of my ex wife and my lawyer used the implications of 'I don't care what the judge says I'm going to do what I want' and 'My lawyer is a lazy piece of shit' to totally destroy her in deposition and then in court.  As a single male that got custody it was absolutely gold.</p>

        <p>This is excellent advice. With a recording you can give a word-for-word transcription.</p>
<p>PS. These laws are an incredible conspiracy of their own -- they are designed to protect police and employers that wrong people. The victim of wrongdoing is NEVER protected by these laws.</p>
<p>PS #2. Definitely check your state. Last time I checked -- Texas allows covert recording as long as you are a participant in the conversation!  California doesn't. <em>I hate this state...</em></p>

        <p>You are correct in Texas for sure as long as it's two adults talking.  Now this may be wrong but my attorney told me that this is nationwide.  I may not be usable in a court of law but can be used in a deposition.  Whatever is said in a deposition as long as it's on the record is admissible.  Sooo if your attorney says to the opposition 'on a call on (date) did you state (whatever)?' They have the choice to lie about it (perjury) or tell the truth (incriminating).  That is one of the major things that nailed my ex wifes ass.</p>

        <p>Well, good thing I am the boss hehe. I don't enforce it though, one of my employee got this Sputnik one, then he got afraid of the second one. He didn't get the 2nd even yet. It's up to him. We don't even mask.</p>

        <p>What they are doing in California is a bit more subtle: They are forcing employers to track "vaccination status" and forcing people to wear masks if they aren't "vaccinated." </p>
<p>So you aren't being fired for not being jabbed, right now they are just subjecting employees to humiliation by making them wear a rag on their faces and constantly forcing them to update their status weekly until they get jabbed.</p>

        <p>Can we get a mod to pin this? It really feels like too many people will make the mistake of handing in their resignation; none of us actually likes the feeling of being fired even when it's the logical and correct path to go down.</p>

        <p>My boss told us he cant legally ask us our status.</p>
<p>Asked us to self attest on a clipboard hanging in the back if we wished to be maskless.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
