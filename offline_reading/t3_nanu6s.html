        <p>This is a tough position to be in, personally I wouldnâ€™t fight them on it. You can offer your view but if they wish to get jabbed, it is their choice to do so. My mom got very mad at my brother for getting the vaccine and their squabbling has only pushed my brother further down the nutjob path (no offense to him)</p>

        <p>Inform your son then, and postpone the decision, so he can make his own decision. </p>
<p>In the meantime, it is up to you to privately talk to your son and explain that this is an experimental gene therapy, unapproved, that the clinical trials are still running until 2023, that he is in a risk group with literally 0% mortality, and the long term effects of this novel technology are completely unknown. These are not conspiracy theories, these are just the facts. </p>
<p>Don't say anything about this to your wife. Your house is already divided on the truth as it is, just make sure your son has a chance to not fall for your wife's delusion.</p>

        <p>To make a comparison meaningful, you need to divide the number of COVID-19 deaths by number of people who were infected, not the total number of people. In NC it's about <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#national-lab">23.8%</a>.</p>
<p>You'll get about 6 deaths per million. Now compare that to probability of dying from the vaccine for the same age group. Or to probability of dying for all other cases, which is about 300 per million.</p>
