        <p>Where can we find current data on how deadly it is? Last I saw was some info from the UK but apparently more ppl are being hospitalized because of it in the us. I’d like some honest information about what is actually going on around here.</p>

        <p>Mostly anywhere but tv or paper media. Best I’ve found is university research and things like that. Someone not getting funded by the government. Even conservative outlets are becoming noticeably different these days. Seems like the same narrative everywhere.  People are putting masks on without a mandate here. Spotted nitrile gloves and a mask lady today. Mask inside car people are back too. Best I can give you is that I was traveling major cities for 2 years before covid hit the news. Looking back, I know it was there, my girl and I felt like crap for a couple weeks. Had a friend and his wife come down with a virus and be hospitalized. They told them it’s a virus but didn’t know which one. My er nurse friend got covid, got her vax and got it two more times. The doctors make fun of it and call it the fancy flu. The covid wing got shut down and is the icu now. They’re sending people home to rest. Major US city, metro hospital. Beginning to think they’re hiring actors. Nobody I know has died. All stories I’ve heard are “my grandpas wife passed”. Nothing about the flu. It didn’t exist these last few years. Heart attack=covid death. Know lots of people in the Er and ICU.  They’re not really buying it either. Neighbor had covid with no vax and was fine. Mid 40s guy, healthy looking. Said it felt like the flu. Tests have been saying it’s covid when you have the flu. SARS was covid. This time they said covid instead of SARS. Too many lies for me to filter. I just know I’m alive and feel fine. Six shots of vodka after dinner and a good nights rest. Should work. - I’m not a doctor.</p>

        <p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1005517/Technical_Briefing_19.pdf">check out the PHE data</a>. Keep in mind that the same issues around comorbidities and age as well as CFR v IFR still exist.  So, if you are younger and healthier, your odds are something in the range of about 40x lower than the shown rate, in the under 50 group.</p>

        <p>Well the original is 99.98% mortality rate so the delta would have a 97.8% survival rate in that case. I’m still taking my chances on those odds even though they’re clearly made up.</p>

        <p>Now I'm not sure if its 100x but we were the country it came from and I've seen severe misery and even deaths of people I knew. I'm sure even you would have watched some of those scenes on TV and it is almost impossible that millions of them were in on it. </p>
<p>It would be better if you would exercise basic level of caution though. I don't mean vaccine or even masks, just practice some long breathing exercises and you'll be fine.</p>
