    <strong>If the vaccine works, why are you still worried about contracting covid-19 from unvaccinated people?</strong>
    <p><p>Has ANYONE ever actually been answered this question? Is there anyone lurking this sub who would like to try and answer it. The entire point of the "vaccine" is immunity, right? Immunity means you are no longer at risk of getting sick. But if you're still worried about getting sick, it means you don't think the vaccine gave you immunity, and therefore was entirely pointless. Why get a vaccine you yourself don't even believe works?</p></p>

        <p>What is the idiocy in getting a vaccine exactly? Especially if, by your logic, you’ve realized there’s some sort of problem with the vaccine? Then you’ve become aware and know to resist such an action by the gov’t in the future, no?</p>

        <p>The doomers big talking point is that we have to reach "herd immunity" and apparently the only way we can do that is if the majority of the population gets the vaccine - as in a good 70+ percent of people. So it won't work unless we all get it, collectively. Don't ask me where the logic is in this argument, I have yet to find it. Most just repeat the propaganda.</p>

        <p>Right? And who is included in this 70% number? Is it by county? City? State? The whole country? If one county with 10,000 people is 60% immune and another county across the state with 10,000 people is 80% immune, do they average out to 70%? If a vaccinated person goes to sleep and the immunity is at 69% and when they wake up it's now at 70%, are they magically safe now? If you're in Maine and someone is vaccinated in Washington, are they protecting you? But what if someone in New Brunswick isn't vaccinated??</p>

        <p>I see my state says 800K first dose, we have 1.3 million residents.</p>
<p>but atleast 300K are under 18, unvaccinated but also no really in my circle of society.</p>
<p>So 800K out of 1 million, sounds like herd immunity for adults.</p>

        <p>They repeat the concept of herd immunity by vaccinations solely without any awareness the WHO surreptitiously changed the definition of herd immunity to exclude natural infections and only be a result of vaccinations</p>
<p>It’s peak 1984 but they don’t seem to have memories long enough to remeber the last lies the media and governments told them so the next lie they take at face value and get played all over again like the suckers they are</p>

<p>If you ask me, it's obvious sign that the covidians are scared shitless of the virus AND the vaccine, but they don't want to admit it, so they project their apprehension onto the anti-lockdown camp.</p>

        <p>I think this prescient CS Lewis quote needs constant repeating: Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.</p>

        <p>It's all quite mystifying to me--on the one hand, doomers act as if ten minutes of walking maskless in a supermarket is enough to spread covid to everyone in the store. Yet on the other hand, 15 months later there is still apparently this never-ending supply of skeptics who have never had covid and thus still have the potential to spread it in the future. But by their own logic, surely all these evil skeptics--who have been out socializing, travelling, and *gasp* gathering without masks for the last year plus--would've already caught this super-contagious virus by now, no? How could it simultaneously be so infectious that you can't be maskless in the supermarket for even one minute, yet conversely so hard to catch that 15 months of socializing and throwing caution to the wind is not enough to get it?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that it's all utter nonsense--it's just mentally comforting to blame someone else for all the world's problems.</p>

        <p>You have forgotten that according to their logic catching covid provides immunity for approximately 17 minutes, if even that long, as opposed to the magical vaccine which provides immunity for longer than that.....how long you ask? Well, it is for certain OBVIOUSLY longer than actual covid but they will need to wait for Lord Fauci to tell them exactly how long.</p>

        <p>Even IF the vaccine provided you with an impenetrable forcefield against Covid, you would not need others to be vaccinated as well in order to be safe. You have to keep in mind though, that these are probably the same people you see driving alone with a mask on. They have been programmed to be afraid and make decisions that contradict all logic, and the thought of an unmasked and unvaccinated individual is nightmare material for them.</p>

        <p>According to official numbers 0.04% of the world's population has died with covid in this horrible pandemic.
While being vaccinated supposedly slashes this scary big number down to an individual risk of 0.006%, one could argue that this is still way too high to risk contact with the unvaccinated.
Everyone being vaccinated should reduce it to 0.000036%, which is starting to get into a range where the bravest might feel comfortable to leave their houses again.</p>

        <p>Even though I used irony, it still is the most plausible explanation that I could come up with as of why someone could possibly worry about unvaccinated people while vaccinated themselves:</p>
<p>Thinking that the risk of getting it is still too high and only vaccinating everyone makes it low enough for them to feel somewhat save.</p>
<p>Of course this requires a rather warped perception of what is happening and the inability to do proper risk-assessment based on putting numbers into proportion with each other.</p>

        <p>I caught it. The irony not the big scary covid19 or as I like to call it a mild inconvenience ironically it's much like the inconvenience of say a seasonal cold or flu. The weirdest thing of all though, it seemed to peak during the time when one would normally be seeing the onset of seasonal illnesses.  So weird that so few are getting colds or flus this year??? Maybe it's because everyone got covid instead? </p>

However months before I got it I was in close contact with hundreds of people that tested positive. No exaggeration probably 200/300 people but very few were actually sick. Just positive tests. I got it 5 months later? I would rather have covid every year if it would keep me from ever getting the awful flu's I've had in my life!</p>

        <p>I’m a lurker - I’m vaccinated and not afraid of catching covid. My life has completely gone back to normal, and it’s great. </p>
<p>I agree that those who are vaccinated (especially with Pfizer and Moderna which were the first released and therefore have a TON of data and studies published about them) shouldn’t be nervous to catch covid. If they are, they should speak with an expert in the field who they trust to answer their questions and concerns. (This is what I did - spoke with experts including an infectious disease doctor, an immunologist, and a PhD whose entire research is on RNA).</p>

        <p>I'm not taking the vaccine and I'm against the "new normal." However, there is an internal logic to the worry about others not being vaccinated. I think we need to understand this logic so we can offer effective counterpoints, rather than just saying "it either works or it doesn't"</p>
<p>Even the most hardcore vaxxer knows that the vaccine cannot provide 100% immunity (just like a condom is not 100% protection, but is still really good protection). So the <em>idea*</em> is that there is still a small possibility a vaccinated person could get covid, so having others around them vaxxed would reduce the possibility further.</p>
<p>Here's an analogy. Let's say you're a woman in your most fertile time of life, and you don't want to get pregnant. You take a pill that's 98% effective but you're still worried about the other 2%. So you want your partners to wear a condom just for the extra protection. </p>
<p>That's the internal logic.</p>
<p>However, if I were someone who believed the vax was safe (and I don't), I'd be content with protecting myself 90-something percent and would accept the remaining risk rather than bullying others into doing something they don't want to do. </p>
<p>*in reality, it seems the possibility is actually quite large so I wonder how efficacious it truly is.</p>

        <p>Vaccine - a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide IMMUNITY against one or several diseases, prepared from the causative agent of a disease, its products, or a synthetic substitute, treated to act as an antigen without inducing the disease. </p>
<p>THAT is the fucking end of it. This narrative that’s been promulgated is that the vaccine “reduces your risk of imminent hospitalization by 95 percent” they’re saying you can still get it, you can still pass it... you can STILL die from it. Reducing your risk of hospitalization with a virus with a survival rate that is over 99%. </p>
<p>I’m not a mathematician or anything... but.. this seems absurd on its face. This cult following of the W.H.O, C.D.C and Fuhrer Fauci is the most insane thing to which I have ever bore witness. </p>
<p>We’re gonna have to square with the fact that some people are perfectly fine with things NOT going back to normal. Not only do they welcome this with open arms, they’re counting on it. </p>
<p>If this WAS one sort of Psyop put on by the global elite, to test the boundaries of compliance for the world population... how do you think we did?</p>

        <p>The "best" answer they've got is some variation of "to protect the vulnerable". But aside from a fractional minority of the "vulnerable" population with severe health issues that prevent them from taking vaccines, there is literally nothing stopping them from getting vaccinated other than their own personal decision one way or the other.  </p>
<p>And, to be blunt, people who are "immunocompromised" to the point of being unable to even handle a vaccine (assuming it's "safe and effective", of course), well, they're typically not long for this world <em>anyway.</em>  </p>
<p>So, in all reality, they actually don't have an answer other than their usual moral grandstanding, which itself has always been a superficial farce anyway.</p>

        <p>I like playing devil's advocate so I'll go ahead. I think they think not getting vaccinate will enhance the chances the virus keep spreading and eventually mutates. A mutated virus could then pose a treat to the vaccinated.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know if this argument makes sense as the vaccine doesn't actually limit spreading but only makes your immune system a bit more prepared to combat the virus.</p>
<p>So the idea that mass vaccination limits the generation of new variants <em>could</em> make sense, but I haven't found reliable data about it. For all we know, the vaccine might also be inducing new variants by indirectly selecting the virus to bypass the vaccine mechanism of action. I think nobody knows for sure, and they're just making stuff as they go along.</p>
<p>The mere fact you're not really permitted to discuss these concepts and potential scenarios is terrifying. Scientific debate has been sacrificed on the altar of control and power of the masses.</p>

        <p>It’s not a vaccine. Vaccines provide immunity, correct. These do not. You can still get it, carry, and pass it along. You just reduce the likelihood of severe infection. Which brings the question, why would anyone get it?</p>

        <p>If that is the case, it cannot be called a vaccine. It does not provide immunity. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

        <p>The outrage is moral based. They know that they sacrificed their potential health to take the vaccine and once herd immunity is reached, there is no need for others to get vaccinated anymore. Now you feel like an idiot because you actually got vaccinated while others get the same "privileges" (strange how we call normal life a privilege...) as you without doing anything.</p>
<p>To them, that feels wrong. Like you've cheated for your freedom.</p>
<p>The other perspective is that there are at risk groups that can't get vaccinated even if they wanted to. Those people can only be "safe" once everyone else is vaccinated. Therefore everyone not vaccinating puts these people at latent risk.</p>
<p>I see this as the main two reasons why people are so angry about not getting vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I posted this before when asked. This is how unbelievable they are. First they said I'll kill my mom and dad. They have both died already from natural causes and were not afraid to. Then came the measles vaccine excuse. If I don't have it and visit a hospital and there is a new baby in the totally sterile and totally closed to the world maternity ward I may transfer it and kill the baby somehow. I couldn't answer as I was in awwwww and couldn't believe a human could actually think this was a thing. Wow. They are weak weak people. You will never change the weak. Maybe MSM but not us.</p>

        <p>I think this prescient quote from CS Lewis is timely: Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.</p>

        <p>The herd immunity is  impractical due to several circumstances, mainly time and virus biology. Time because you need to vaccinate in a short amount of time and virus biology, because in autumn you would have new variants that will make vaccine ineffective . The solution is to protect the weak and support policies that improve health and public life (masks and hygiene in hospital, sick-day when asymptomatic and so on).</p>

        <p>Reducing the spread decreases the chance it mutates and potentially becomes more deadly or contagious. Or, worst case scenario, it mutates in a way that renders the vaccine and existing immunities ineffective. That is why reaching herd immunity is so important so the chances of mutation are far far slimmer</p>

        <p>Let's pretend for a second that this gene therapy actually does make symptoms less severe (I seriously doubt that, but let's pretend). In that case, you have the protection you sought out by getting jabbed. If someone who didn't get it is a carrier spreads the virus to you and you become infected, isn't this the whole point of the jab? Now your symptoms will be much less severe, so it's all good, right? And since even the jabbed can still be carriers, there is literally zero reason why it would matter for anyone other than yourself whether or not you get it.</p>

        <p>But I don't see how. Do you not recall the MSM actually being transparent about that way at the start when they began the rollout? I do. Even when I speak to normies they know that. They don't think the vaccine has any effect on transmission rates.</p>

        <p>I'm not worried about me. I'm worried about my 2yo son and my neighbor who can't get the vaccine and all the other children and neighbors. </p>
<p>You can spout your idiotic percentages all you want but unless the chance of death is 0% for when my son inevitably catches this disease in the next 3 years before a vaccine is approved for his age group, I don't really give a shit. The longer y'all hold out and delay herd immunity the longer I view you as vectors to kill my child. In that light it's you or him and the choice is easy for me.</p>

        <p>I assume you have fingers and half a working brain. But I could be wrong about the brain.</p>
<p>I look forward to some "the underlying conditions killed him not Covid" bullshit as if you explain gunshot deaths as actually massive blood loss and not the bullet that killed them</p>
<p>&rt;The child’s death was one of six deaths linked to COVID-19 reported by OHA on Thursday. The infant boy was in Umatilla County and he had underlying conditions, according to health officials.</p>
<p>&rt;No further details were released about the child.</p>
<p>&rt;“Every death from COVID-19 is a tragedy, even more so the death of a child. The death of an infant is extremely rare. This news represents a tremendous loss to the mother and family. My thoughts are with them during this difficult time,” said Dr. Dean Sidelinger, OHA’s health officer and state epidemiologist.</p>

        <p>Your point was that I was correct? Odd but I'll take it. Sorry for arguing with yah then. Cause for a second there it seemed like you were saying there were no deaths in very young children... And as "very rare" doen't mean "none" it is would be confusing to use that as your coup détat.</p>

<p>Well good thing because the cance of death to kids lower than 13 is already 0%, Covid can't kill your 2 years old, you should be happy.</p>

        <p>Covid can't kill your son (see, i left out the 0% chance of death to minors), but hate to break it to you that the viral shedding from the vaxxed can be a threat to him. If I were you, I'd protect your son by keeping him away from the vaxxed.</p>
