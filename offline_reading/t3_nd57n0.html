    <strong>"But haven't you seen what's on TV???"</strong>
    <p><p>Long story short. Went into store without mask because I'm done with this shit, I've stayed in there for about 45 minutes and absolutely no one told me anything.</p>
<p>Well, no one until I went to the checkout, and this crazy young cashier starts screaming at me to "wEaR mY mAsK". I calmly asked her "why, they're proven to be highly ineffective and pretty much useless, plus I'm clearly very distanced from you".</p>
<p>She didn't care and got very triggered and started screaming that she wouldn't have served me as long as I put on my mask, followed by this golden nugget:</p>
<p><em>"BUT HAVENT YOU SEEN WHAT'S ON TV? DO YOU THINK WE'RE ALL STUPID TO COMPLY???"</em></p>
<p>Well... No, I don't watch TV. And do I think you're all stupid? Yes, yes I do.</p>
<p>She even called the "security guy" who was honestly kinda embarrassed and didn't even know what to tell me. Poor creature.</p></p>

        <p>Lmao she even asked me if I'm a doctor. Because OBVIOUSLY my opinion only matters if I have a degree in medicine. Doesn't matter if I work with doctors on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>My mother cut off the cable when I was 5 or 6 and I used to think that kinda sucked because I didn't know anything that happened during the 90's and early 00's really. But then once I got my own place, I got streaming services and never used my TV anyway so I pawned it. I'll always be glad now that Mom didn't want us influenced by all the bullshit on tv. When reality is so different from TV that you wouldn't even know about a pandemic if you didn't see it on there......what does that tell you about what you're watching?</p>

        <p>It's kind of ironic or hypocritical of me to tell people on here to stop watching TV because I actually get all my news from Reddit...
 If there is a specific story that I need to read I'll go and do so based upon information I get here and several other subs... </p>
<p>We had cut cable for about 6 years allowed my mom to move in she said she needed it and she paid for it and then a year and a half later she moved out and we got rid of it again and didn't have it ever again.</p>
<p>We were one of the first people I knew that had a streaming Roku box...</p>
<p>now at that point my wife and I binged so much TV that it affected our marriage...</p>
<p>Then I affected the crap out of our marriage and when we got a divorce I let her keep the TV..</p>
<p>I bought a projection unit and a DVD player and bought used movies I'm not saying get rid of all entertainment but constantly watching mainstream media to see what's going on and what they have to say it's just poisonous at a certain point. 
After my divorce while dating every woman that would come over was just amazed that I just wanted to sit there and talk and listen to music...</p>

        <p>I think there's something about watching TV that fucks with people's minds. A lot of people I know with political views that would normally land them far from fascism have embraced the fear, and they all watch news on TV. I would only do it when visiting my parents, and I haven't been able to do that since this bullshit started.</p>
