    <strong>Reminder about conduct on /r/NoNewNormal</strong>
    <p><p>This subreddit exists to discuss societal changes brought about in reaction to the novel coronavirus in a critical but civilized way. This is a place to share information and talk about what's going on in an open setting. It should be open to all viewpoints. This space is not merely an echo chamber. There is enough "us versus them" mentality out there, and it would seem to be unhelpful to extend that sort of thinking and behavior here. Many, if not most, of you have done amazing work in keeping the subreddit lively and thriving, and the discussions have been wonderful.</p>
<p>However, please be advised that incivility and rudeness, including namecalling, are not permitted in the subreddit, as that does not create the climate for a free exchange of ideas. Additionally, there is zero tolerance for threats of violence, or insinuation thereof.</p>
<p>In short, please treat everyone as you would like to be treated yourself. Be kind to one another.</p></p>
