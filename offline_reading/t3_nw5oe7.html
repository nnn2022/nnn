        <p>It’s not Democrats. It’s not Republicans. Both parties exist for purely theatrical purposes. The real powers that be have no political party. They have one goal in mind, and <a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">it’s the Great Reset</a>.</p>

        <p>I find the political (D/R) position on this very interesting. </p>
<p>I saw a post a few weeks ago that called "anti-vaxxer" Republicans, and I thought it was very odd. But it seems to be true. </p>
<p>I don't consider myself to be a Republican. I didn't vote for trump, I've never voted Republican. I was a fan of Obama.</p>
<p>When this all started going on (pre-vaccine), I did an assessment of my health risk with the available information at the time, and I continued to do so through the pandemic. I was looking forward to a vaccine. </p>
<p>Now, post-vaccine becoming available, it seems this administration went off the deep end. </p>
<p>The vaccine was/is a choice. Frontline workers, the elderly, those with known health issues, those with health issues, absolutely should have been priority.</p>
<p>When they started pushing this, marketing, bribing, on the demographics that simply aren't at risk of SARS-CoV-2, alarm bells started going off for me. Then came the shaming, the "get the vaccine or your stupid". There was no valid reason to push this on those demographics that that didn't want it. There was no need to push this on children. The statistics are all there. If you know how to use Excel, this is simple math. </p>
<p>This was EUA for responding quickly to those in need of it. They all seem to have gotten it. Great! There's no need to vaccinate the entire country.</p>
<p>When you add those with natural immunity to the pool of those that are vaccinated, we've well surpassed 70%.</p>
<p>Why risk the possibility for unknown affects of this vaccine, when there's simply not a need for it. </p>
<p>I don't consider myself a Republican, I don't consider myself anti-vax, and I'm for sure not anti science, and I'm open to seeing evidence of why these other demographics should be vaccinated. But there is no evidence, other than fear, for them to be doing this.</p>
<p>This is a corrupt administration.</p>

        <p>From UK, I'd agree this isn't party political.</p>
<p>Both main parties (Labour and Conservative) are fully aligned on lockdown etc.</p>
<p>Ec Labour pm Blair is also main cheerleader for vaccinations.</p>
<p>Democracy is dead imho.</p>
