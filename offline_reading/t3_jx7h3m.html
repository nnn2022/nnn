        <p>So with a US population of 340 million, a 99.5% survival rate means that more than a million people would die if everyone was infected. Is that...acceptable to the people on this sub? And that survival rate drops way down when hospitals get overwhelmed and can’t provide services to the newly infected/hospitalized.</p>

        <p>Ok, we can take 99.98% from the 20-49 age demographic as an average for the country. That’s still 1.1 million people dead. My point is that that is a LOT of people. Is that number of hypothetical dead acceptable to the sub? Is the actual death toll of 250,000 “acceptable casualties”?</p>

        <p>A LOT of people die every day. I don’t understand the obsession with the deaths from Covid. Do you care the same way about people dying from the flu? From obesity? Heart disease? Have you cared about the elderly before Covid? I’m not trying to be patronizing, but it is ridiculous to lock down society for something the vast majority of people will deal with just fine. Truthfully there is risk in everything we do. Would you not drive a car because there is certainly risk of dying?</p>

        <p>That’s true, lots of people do die everyday. I have cared about those issues before the pandemic, and I’m incredibly supportive of the people make it their mission to solve these problems. The focus on deaths from COVID comes from the fact that there’s a clear causal relationship between not following the science of infectious disease and an increase in cases and deaths. To me, I’m happy to take an extra burden on my day-to-day life of wearing a mask and not going to bars if my actions help prevent the spread of the virus. If I got infected I’d likely be ok, but I might have spread it to someone else who might NOT be fine, and I don’t want someone else’s suffering on my conscience. Many of these deaths are preventable just by following some guidelines, and if we can each do something to help save the lives of our neighbors I think we should.</p>
<p>And if we’re talking about the vast majority, that still includes 1.1 million deaths.</p>
<p>I do agree with your point about risks though. Life is full of them every day. But I don’t agree with many peoples’ arguments that that means we should remove all restrictions and have a big party (nor do I agree that that means we should shut everything down indefinitely and wreck our small businesses).</p>

        <p>The mindset is that people need to take charge of their own health and leave me the fuck alone. 1.35 million die a year from car accidents but I dont see roads being shut down or cars being made illegal.</p>
<p>Death sucks but if you took a good look at death statistics annually then you'd see covid is a drop in the bucket compared to all the other shit that kills. </p>
<p>This pandemic really exposed the people who have no grasp of large numbers like population and death statistics. </p>
<p>Extrapolation of covid deaths to 1.1m or any number is also questionable given how bad of a test PCR is and how hospitals are financially incentivized to count covid as the cause of death for literally anything they can get away with. </p>
<p>"Oh man this guy has a bullet in his skull? Well the guy has a dead chunk of virus in his nose so we'll count it as a covid death" lol</p>

        <p>36,560 people died from car accidents in the US in 2018. Currently the death toll for COVID is almost 7 times higher than that, so I don’t think that’s a great comparison. (And 1.3 million people have died worldwide already)</p>
<p>It’s also not just about people taking charge of their own health. Your actions and behaviors have a direct impact on the spread of the virus, so it’s not just about you, it’s about the people you come in contact with as well. That’s why people should wear masks: the benefits of someone being minority inconvenienced on a day-to-day basis are completely outweighed by the public health benefits to the population being better protected from the virus. </p>
<p>The extrapolation to 1.1 million deaths isn’t about the accuracy of tests or reporting, it’s the fatality rate from the photo above (using the less-deadly rate for the sake of argument) and assuming everyone got infected. It also assumes that hospitals aren’t overwhelmed and can provide care to everyone, which is unrealistic if everyone is getting infected. If anything, it’s underestimated. Even if it was 20% less, is that kind of death from preventable circumstances worth it to you?</p>

        <p>I'm not sure shutting down the economy, ruining people's livelihoods, raising the national debt, inflating prices, shitting on people's mental health, etc etc is a minor inconvenience. </p>
<p>The default stance in march towards whether or not the piece of paper over our faces does anything was a resounding NO , while lockdowns do nothing because covid spreads like wildfire no matter what. </p>
<p>You're talking about preventable deaths and so am I. Why dont we make cars illegal? We are outlawing going outside in the name of saving lives so we might as well outlaw the cars, alcohol, sugary beverages, motorcycles, etc. They all kill! Maybe if we made obesity and vitamin d deficiency illegal, covid wouldn't be as big as a deal. </p>
<p>The death numbers are total BS. PCR test is stupid and inaccurate, rapid tests are stupid/inaccurate, government pays hospitals to report as many covid deaths as possible, but im supposed to think that numbers are underrepresented????? Lol </p>
<p>If you want me to wear the piece of paper, fine. I do generally. But this other crippling shit? No thanks. People's lives are dogshit right now and there's a hard line that needs to be drawn between helping others and standing up for YOURSELF, because the "cure" to this is worse than the actual disease. If you're scared of covid just lock yourself in your house and fuck off . Because nothing will stop you from getting it lol</p>

        <p>It sounds like you’re coming at this from a very black and white perspective, but I think it’s more nuanced than that. Most importantly though, the ideas that lockdowns and masks don’t do anything is categorically false. COVID doesn’t spread “no matter what.” It’s a virus that’s transmitted from person to person, and wearing masks, washing hands, and avoiding unnecessary social contacts all have a demonstrated impact on the spread of the disease. </p>
<p>When it comes to your car analogy, we already do so much to lessen the deaths created by crashes: seatbelts, airbags, crumple zones, etc. It sounds like you’re trying to characterize my argument as a “BAN IT ALL AND KEEP PEOPLE JAILED IN THEIR HOMES” kind of thing. It’s not. I’m definitely not saying you can’t go outside, but that if people do they should be seriously considering the risks of catching and transmitting the virus to others, which many don’t seem to be doing. </p>
<p>I’m terms of the impact on people’s livelihoods, It doesn’t have to be this bad. There are a ton of different options to lessen the economic and social impact on small businesses and individuals, but we have what amounts to zero national coordination or leadership when it comes to helping people weather this storm. Yes the economic impact is bad. And it will continue to get worse as people get sick, spread it to others, and delay reopening and restarting our economy even further. The more seriously we take this now, the less time it will take for things to get back to normal.</p>
<p>You also totally missed my point on the numbers. I’m not arguing about whether or not the tests are inaccurate or the deaths are over reported (but I would genuinely love some sources about that since I’m not as educated as I should be on that particular point). My point is that if everyone got infected, and we used a CDC’s fatality rate that is too optimistic for the population at large (since it deals with a younger, more resilient age group), then we would get 1.1 million deaths. That’s more than all the deaths in combat from every military conflict since the civil war combined.</p>

        <p>Nope, it’s infamous because it spreads through the fecal-oral route, infects only humans, and a vaccine was available, which made it a good target for elimination. None of the factors that went into the polio effort are true of the rona.</p>

        <p>It only caused some kind of paralysis in 0.5% of cases, and of those, only about a quarter died. The rest of its cases were either asymptomatic or caused mild illness which resulted in full recovery.</p>
