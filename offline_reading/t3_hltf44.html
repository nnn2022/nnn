    <strong>I am concerned about long-lasting effects of physical distancing</strong>
    <p><p>I have to say I am really, really concerned about the unseen dangers behind physical distancing. A few images haunt me: people crossing to the other side, people not willing to shake hands, people not willing to talk to anyone else other than from behind a mask (or, more hideous, from behind a plastic screen), people not willing to fill an empty seat next to a stranger on a bus or in a stadium.</p>
<p>I think we are at a historical crossroads and I think telling masses of people that their default behaviour should be seeing any other human being's physical presence as a threat is very very dangerous. Nothing good can come out if it. Media should stop right now broadcasting messages where the fellow human is identified as a threat.</p>
<p>Even as adults, we slip into habits more easily than we'd like to admit. Let alone children; imagine a young in her formative years being bombarded from all directions with advice to avoid at all cost being physically close to anyone else. That would be very, VERY hard to unlearn during adult life. There's a real danger that, before we know it, we'll turn into a society where the physical proximity of another individual will be frowned upon as a norm. Not meaning to be dramatic here, but where will this take us as a species?</p>
<p>PS: am I the only one bothered by those who use "social distancing" when what they really mean is "physical distancing"? I mean, they can't even use language properly, but they have the nerve to tell us how to live our lives.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed some typos. A bit hypocritical of me to talk about other ones' use of language, isn't it?</p></p>

        <p>Had the same thoughts today. Last night my son lit some (safe) fireworks in our street and some neighbors came by to watch. One family with two boys 7 and 9 were all masked up even though we were outside. The boys were playing around and one came within a few feet of where i was sitting and the mom immediately yelled at him to "get back over here with me!" as if I were carrying the plague. A few weeks ago I was outside chatting with other neighbors and their girls were inside, finally they called to their mom and she went over and when she came back she said "they are afraid to come out of the house because of all the people out here."</p>
<p>If this doesn't stop soon it is going to be really hard to reverse the damage done to this generation of kids.</p>
<p>I also refuse to say "social distancing". Nothing "social" about it.</p>

        <p>Bro, I can't deal with hearing kids being traumatized like that. Kids are literally zero risk. There is so much evidence to back up how unaffected they are, and how unable to transmit they are, even going back to the early outbreaks in china. 
Kids are susceptible to respiratory syncytial virus which kills way more kids yearly than covid ever will to them. 
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-depnmark-reopening-idUSKBN2341N7
There was a story about the worst weekend of shootings in Chicago around Father's day and something along the lines of more kids (&lt;18) were killed in Chicago that weekend than Covid has killed kids since the start of the outbreak.
Everytime I hear kids being trained to get head starts on OCD, PTSD, and other mental illnesses from these treatments, it really destroys me because there isn't even an argument for it.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a parent that 's smart enough not to ruin your son's childhood like that.</p>

        <p>When that happens, make sure you let the other parents know that their kids are okay/not bothering you... I think some people now are assuming that people will be personally offended if someone’s kid gets close to them and they don’t grab them and shoo them away... We went to the mall and ate at the (finally partially open) food court today for lunch, and after looking around at everyone for a few minutes, my 3 year old told me he wants a mask!! I told him we don’t have to wear them just because some other people are, and he looked around again, and said he still wants one... I felt defeated</p>

        <p>So, so glad to live in the Midwest, where I don't have to deal with that stuff. My approach is simple -- invite kid's friend's family to activity that will require them to interact closely. Either they'll decline politely citing social distancing or a "high risk" relative, or they'll accept and we can act as if nothing is going on. Thus far, 90% of everyone we know is in the later group. Other than school and work being from home (which sucks), the rest of my life is fairly normal (aside from a lot id bitching about corona-doomers).</p>
<p>Seriously -- the Midwest, it's the place to be.</p>

        <p>I keep running into people, including at LDS and here, that seem to believe this is going to be a temporary hiccup, and everything will resume back to normal. I think not... I think a whole slew of people will be forever altered, and society will also change, just how much really depends on how soon we mitigate the damage done by this.</p>

<p>This is it. We have forever altered society on a massive scale. It’s not going back. Why can’t people see this? </p>

        <p>Damn, that's seriously depressing. But this is what I fear...too much damage has already been done, and it's way too late. All this bullshit is now deeply entrenched into every facet of society, and millions have accepted the false narrative and new abnormal. Unless there is a monumental shift where they all get exposed and are held accountable on a massive scale, where the media and these "experts" are shunned as complete liars and no one ever takes them seriously again. Unless a flip is switched and the world is somehow made to see the truth...but will that ever happen?</p>

        <p>The only way I see the tide turning is if more media coverage is done on the damaging effects of lockdown and the “new normal”. I’m talking about the economic, social and psychological impacts of both. The consequences are endless and they are not being discussed or given a voice in the larger discourse. </p>
<p>People aren’t willing to listen to the science surrounding the virus. They’re convinced that their authorities know best and there’s no changing their minds about that. That route is a dead end. People will always claim misinformation and conspiracy theories, no matter what data you show them, as long as it refutes the accepted narrative of eminent death and long term organ damage. </p>
<p>I’m hoping there are still some sensible people left in this world and when the consequences of these new measures become more clear, they will begin to change their tune or at least start questioning things more.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly. It's been this way since March, really. This is why I get frustrated when people at /r/lockdownskepticism say that "well, all we need is to show them the data, then they'll finally change their minds". It won't work because of what you wrote.</p>

        <p>But how can science every be taken seriously again if this bullshit narrative continues? How can they continue claiming this crackpot shit is "science", because their high priest Fauci and the media-anointed quacks told them so? It's extremely damaging to science and all logic, reason, and common sense has been flushed down the toilet this year as society regressed to medieval mass hysteria.</p>

        <p>Yup; online dating has always been the biggest crapshoot of all, and now it's the de facto only way of meeting someone. That's <em>if</em> you can convince them to meet. Without a mask, so you can actually see their face. And perhaps sit together at a distance which allows any intimacy whatsoever!</p>

        <p>I completely agree. It reminds me a bit of the “stranger danger” campaign that makes it difficult for children to trust any strange adult... even an adult who would help them avoid a sketchy adult. </p>
<p>However, my daughter is a bit relieved that she no longer is pressured to hug and kiss her grandparents (pressured by them! We never pressure her to hug and kiss them). She is not big on contact like that with anyone but her dad and me, and she likes having the excuse.</p>

        <p>It really does upset me that we are now all required (by our governors, you know, for our safety) to wear masks and see each other as a threat. I have anxiety about going some places and seeing everyone in masks...I was confirmed Catholic last year and liked my church community before all this happened. Yet I was in tears at the thought of going to church and having to see masked parishoners, taped Xs on the floor for communion and pews marked off for social distancing. So I just haven't gone. (Although there are other people upset about the restrictions as well.) I'm now dreading going figure skating again, a sport I loved doing and was just picking up before all this happened, because my club decided masks will be required on the ice and they will be taking everyone's temperature. They'll also be wiping the boards where we put our water bottles, "to keep everyone healthy." So again, they are treating us as sick and untrustworthy and taking away my agency to decide how I want to go through life. I was thinking about my upcoming session in two weeks and have a pit in my stomach about having to put a mask on to enter the ice and then skate in it for an hour and a half. I don't even jump or anything; I'm just learning my moves.</p>
<p>I'm worried that when minor league baseball comes back next year, that PA will still have a mask mandate. I will end up quitting my job because I know I won't enjoy it in a mask and having to follow social distancing measures. </p>
<p>Everything I loved about life is gone. I wonder if it'll ever go back to the way it was. All the things I mentioned I enjoyed, and those I didn't mention in the post, are gone because of the emphasis on staying apart and not interacting in "large crowds" or "mass gatherings." It makes me sad to be treated as diseased or disgusting and admonished to "cover (my) face."</p>

        <p>I have hope that we’ll go back to 2019 levels of normal as I can’t see the average man putting up with these restrictions and distancing regulations at work and social gatherings but it’ll take a lot more anger and resent towards them than what’s already around or the government saying “ it’s all good it’s over“ like we’re in the fucking contagion movie, but that requires the virus to either go away or a vaccine.  And considering the MSM freaks out whenever there’s new cases ( not deaths ) it’s a tough battle. I’d like to think after all disasters and human mistakes ( Spanish flu, Prohibition, Vietnam war) that enough pushback will reverse it.  </p>
<p>But considering my generation only cares about virtue signalling and American events it’s hard to have faith. No other generation would’ve done this.  However social interaction is intrinsic to us as a species.  </p>
<p>I hope come thanksgiving/Christmas people will finally stop this madness, but the MSM will probably ramp up “ second wave “ stories, posts on socially distanced Christmas dinner and how selfish people went out on Black Friday.</p>

        <p>&rt;am I the only one bothered by those who use "social distancing" when what they really mean is "physical distancing"? I mean, they can't even use language properly, but they have the nerve to tell us how to live our lives.</p>
<p>I've been saying this throughout, I hate the term social distancing as it gets the wrong message across. I totally agree that it should be spatial or physical distancing. To me, social distancing implies cutting yourself off from people altogether, not reaching out to people and connecting with them. This is the opposite of what's needed right now with people experiencing loneliness and isolation.</p>
<p>This post is great and sums things up perfectly. Children have received such contradictory messages throughout this that it'll surely have an impact.</p>

        <p>You are too right, and this was something I thought about months ago also. The psychological consequences are so significant that it scares me. I see the distrust in the eyes of some portion of people each time I go into a retail establishment. It's not just that they stand at the door to tell me what the rules are; they seem to be <em>happy</em> to, as if this is there chance to have power or something. If I were still in retail, I would be practically apologetic just by my nature. They are the opposite, all that I've encountered so far.</p>
<p>When I think of stuff like this, I can't help but wonder if the government wanted to further weaken society by separating people, making them distrustful of each other, and so on. (Why though? Social chaos is not exactly easy to govern. Economic ramifications...) I know it's conspiracy-adjacent but there are SO MANY <em>OBVIOUS</em> HARMS perpetuated by pandemic policy that I have a hard time believing it wasn't designed to be harmful. </p>
<p>It hurts too much to think about what they've done to us, and so I will give you my last 50-coin thing and leave the sub now. </p>
<p>And the fact that liberals and progressives cheer all this -- I am no longer with them and I would sooner vote for Trump at this point than these extremely dangerous people who are always <em>pretending</em> they care about people, but they don't. They are extremists, they would take away freedoms and laugh all the while as long as it could be done under the flag of "social justice" or virtue signalling. They care about robots and butterflies more than people. They will happily call for censorship, and are succeeding in doing so now via corporate concessions to them. They are incipient fascists, while they claim Trump and co are. (They have a point, but they are also projecting their own fascist desires.)</p>
<p>Err, sorry.</p>

        <p>The problem is not just physical distancing in everyday life, it’s the cancellation of all events. Professional sports, concerts and festivals give people a sense of community and shared experience. Even worse are all the minor sporting events that have been cancelled. Young athletes’ lives revolve around tournaments, which become family activities. Are we supposed to stop celebrating graduations and weddings and milestone birthdays and anniversaries. How can society be OK with palliative patients being deprived of contact with their loved ones? People want to change the whole education system over something that is of no greater danger to children and youth than any garden variety virus. This is mass hysteria, and those tempted to speak out about it risk ridicule. The fabric of society is being torn apart. Something has got to give.</p>

        <p>It is concerning but I also think we still have to separate the hyper obsessive paranoiacs on social media and the real world. I've been taking public transportation and today people were completely ignoring the 'social distancing' signs that were limiting where people could sit. It's an improvement already from 2-3 weeks ago. And this is after some more scary messages about making masks mandatary from the government were published. And I think it also depends on region and culture. This was 4th of July celebrations in Atlanta. People are in a huge crowd and dancing: https://mobile.twitter.com/sota_jahra/status/1279803672034185216 (unfortunately I believe a shooting took place soon after but the point still stands that people were just living their lives without the covid police mentality).</p>

        <p>i have a very pessimistic and fatalistic view of humans, so i believe that the widespread view that individuals are threats and disease vectors will sooner or later lead to killings, or genocide, human rights violations, or just general violence. its disturbing how easily msm and govts have propagandized and manipulated people into extreme hysteria, fear, and massive behavioral changes.  governments and mainstream media could very easily propagandize and manipulate people into committing crimes against humanity</p>
<p>so whenever i see or interact with someone that is scared of covid, i think to myself, "they might murder someone out of fear of the virus," or, "they will go along with government led atrocities because they are scared of the virus," or, "mainstream media might propagandize them into committing violence."</p>

        <p>I dont know if we are at a historical crossroads, but I do echo your concerns for the short term future--I think there will be a generation, should this continue for longer, that suffers with communication as a result. That said--as a species we have not evolved out of needing human touch or connection. We are, whatever the internet likes to say, VERY social creatures--we thrive in forming communities and face to face interaction and our technology can bridge those gaps but not replace it. Eventually we will come out of this on the other side.</p>

        <p>One of the most concerning things was how people's true nature has come out from the woodworks as soon as the panic started. The other day I had two incidents in the same day :</p>
<p>First, my landlord took one of my packages without my permission. She does this sometimes so I assumed she must have taken it when I saw it, so I headed to the leasing office (mailbox is RIGHT outside my apartment - even doomers probably wouldn't wear masks for such a short trip) when I opened the door she flipped a table at me. She FLIPPED a TABLE at me, and started screaming at me to go get a mask and come back. Thankfully there's no mask mandate in my state yet so I told her to give me my packages or I'd call the postal inspector on her. Since then she's left me alone.</p>
<p>Second, I got a doordash order - the driver was actually a cool guy that was really good at his job. I went down to the front doors of my apartment complex and saw a man standing in the doorway, as well as my driver standing by the callbox, just wanting to get inside and do his job. The man slammed the door in both of our faces. I apologized profusely to the driver and threw him an extra $5 just because people are terrible.</p>
<p>These aren't even extreme examples, or rare examples, this happens ALL the time. Doomers are the very definitions of drama queens and they feed on the attention of others - just like a bay throwing a tantrum, you just need to let them cry it out. If somebody flips another table at me though, there's going to be some problems (and this is coming from a pretty non-confrontational guy).</p>
