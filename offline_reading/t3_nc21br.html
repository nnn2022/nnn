        <p>After reading all of this, now we see who's the one that has the most to lose by dissolving all of this covid nonsense. We also know that this same person, has also been shilling on the behalf of several pharmecutical companies, who are currently competing against each other to provide a solution to whatever has been released from that Wuhan laboratory. This person, is also the same one who's also continuously flip flopping on their narrative, in order to remain as relevant as possible, while also dodging any attempts to being challenged to answer any questions about their inconsistent, detrimental, and conflicting opinions on the subject matter. This same person, also wants to use their position in higher forms of government to be able to use it as a means to micromanage the many aspects, interactions, and other functions of everyone's lives, with the forced adoption of privacy invasive methods, that easily permit the government to act with as much overreach as it possibly can, in any socially acceptable manner.</p>
<p>This person, is who we all know as, Dr. Fauci.</p>
