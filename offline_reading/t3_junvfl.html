        <p>I have to at work unfortunately. If I don’t then I risk losing my job, getting a fine and potentially facing imprisonment. I am not exaggerating, that is literally the consequences of not wearing the masks on the sheet of paper they gave me.</p>

        <p>The problem with that people don't know their rights, you literally have the law with you, you can bring an exemption to the work and tell them you have a right to refuse it, there is no law that tells you to wear a mask or go to jail or get find for not wearing a mask but you definitely have the right to refuse it under the </p>

<p>•If i get kicked, they would be the ones who are not fallowing the law because they are discriminating against me, and at that point i could use any of these discrimination lebels against them in court.</p>

        <p>No you misunderstood me, and taking your response as an example, 
&rt;if i get kicked, they would be the ones who are not fallowing the law because they are discriminating against me, and at that point i could use any of these discrimination lebels against them in court.</p>
<p>How are you coming to this conclusion? Wearing a mask is a regulation that anyone is being told to follow. If the regulation isnt specific to ones race, religion, or the other set discriminatory parameters written out above, you wouldn't be able to claim it's a violation of the civil rights act. Like, think of a beach side restaurant with the sign "no shirt, no shoes, no service." Busineeses have always had the capacity to turn people away for violations to their dress code. Beyond that, a ton of nice restaurants and night clubs wont let you in without fancy or nice clothes on, and those places have never been found to be discriminatory</p>

        <p>A mask is not a dress code you don't know what your even talking about, i can refuse it by using the civil Rights act or the ADA laws that says if i was refused service because of my exemption, they could be fined $70,000 for the first attempt of kicked or refused and the second time they can be fined $150,000 do research before you say anything. Wearing a mask is not a law or a regulation, wearing mask is mandatory, that means i don't have to wear it if i don't want to, mandatory means they encourage you to wear it but they can not force you to do so.</p>

        <p>It’s not discrimination. It’s the same as a clothing policy at a nice restaurant or having to wear shoes in a gas station. Private property can enforce whatever rules they want as long as it doesn’t violate one of the listed categories.</p>

        <p>You don't have to wear shoes you can wear sandals if you want. People wear it even out said and indoor not because of any law but because your feet wouldn't get dirty or damaged by the ground. Its common sense. Stop trying to make masks normal they are not normal.</p>

        <p>No that means mask work one way. It catches your spit, it doesn't matter if you wear one or not, if someone like you spits on you, you get their germs and viruses. If they wore a mask you wouldn't get sick.</p>

<p>Yes it is. Ive done <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PCmaniac24/comments/jx7u5z/social_distancing_masks_helps/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">experiments like this</a> and the results show so.</p>
<p>Masks catch your spit.</p>
<p>If I have a mask, and someone else coughs on me, my mask doesn't prevent me from getting their germs. However, if they have a mask on as well, it then is caught by their mask and I don't get their germs.</p>
<p>It's very basic.</p>

        <p>Your baby brother with asthma (if he exists and it’s not simply invented for points on an online discussion) is risking a dreadful bacterial infection on his throat by walking around with a Petri dish strapped to his face, and the excess CO2 will harm him in the same way excess CO2 harms you when it comes in the form of pollution.</p>

        <p>Yeah all of that’s wrong it seems like waste to spend much more time linking articles but CO2 would not accumulate in the mask so that really is null and void, and also the bacteria you speak of is not actually a concern at all. But I do leave you with this shut actual fuck up you orange peel of a human being doing your own research as I’m sure you brag about is actually incompetent you have google the CDC has billions of dollars and while not the best does actually want to help not just whine about a at most minor inconvenience, fuck off, before your spread not only your stupidity but an actual virus we lack the ability to treat.</p>

        <p>Bud again that’s not how that works if I had strep throat it would mean I have already contracted strep throat before hand meaning that the mask played no part in it you can’t get sick from a mask because those are your germs that your body is used to or have already made you sick once again a mask only protects you.</p>
