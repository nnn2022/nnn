        <p>I know it's popular in Australia to bash  own country and idolise Europe or North America. I had the same feelings two years ago before I moved to Canada. While I was there I quickly found out how lucky we have it here. Yes our large cities are corrupt to the core and alcoholism is fairly normalised but our culture is one of a kind. Our instinct to be up fromt and honest about our views (even if they are misguided and not thought out) is rare in today's world. While I made friends overseas I always felt like I was walking on egg shells in conversation to avoid being seen as "aggressive" or "rude". That combined with the general lack of witty humour made me feel like a shell of my former self. I guess what I'm trying to say is please recognise that Australia's worst is often other countries best. We need to strong in who we are if we're going to face the threat of authoritarianism.</p>

        <p>It's amazing how my opinion is literally 180 degrees the opposite of yours lol. I'm not saying you're wrong to feel how you do, but I first started going to the US in 2013 and something about it just immediately made me feel at home. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells HERE and it definitely feels like Australia's badge of honour is to make as many anti America jabs as possible.</p>
<p>Again, not having a go, but just funny how I feel the complete polar opposite. I will say though that I think where you live in Australia plays a huge part. I grew up in fnq but have been stuck in Brisbane for 15 long miserable years and cannot wait to get out of here.</p>

        <p>American here. I was talking to another Aussie on here awhile back. I was saying that I NEVER imagined Australians to take all this covid shit sitting down. Nearly everyone I met while traveling across the UK were Australians. I had so much fun with them wherever I was. I was told it was like a rite of passage for Australians to travel abroad for months. Later on I spent a month driving through the south east parts of Australia, nearly all of NSW and VIC. And I always planned to go back and do the north/north east parts. Then I started dating an Aussie here who was all about muh guns and muh Aussie pride. He was from Sydney. He's one of maybe two I have ever met in the US and I've lived all over the US. I insulted a New Zealander once because of his accent and boy did he let me know about it immediatelyüòÇ</p>
<p>So I've been shocked to see this happen and keep happening. And the guy I was speaking with on here said that I had Australians all wrong and it makes me kinda sad. Do you think Aussie's outside the major cities act like this? Americans mostly do not.</p>

        <p>I grew up outside the city and like you, never would have guessed that the people I grew up with would have fallen for this craziness but I think they have. But I'll say it's definitely not as bad as the city folk, but I guess that makes sense worldwide? In the smaller towns, at least where I'm from, people are too preoccupied with farming and other economic areas where the town's livelihood depends on cutting out the political bullshit and just getting on with it.</p>
<p>That said, it really does sadden me that a lot of people, even in the smaller towns, have fallen for it. But I definitely wouldn't take a travelling Australian as a particularly accurate representation of the typical Australian. The typical Australian would never leave Australia in the first place, because they tend to have their head wedged so far up their backside that they're not even aware other countries in the world exist, or they just believe Australia is the greatest place on earth solely because "America is bad". Boils my blood lol</p>

        <p>Most Americans are like that too. No need to travel outside of their own country and I'd say most of them never leave their own state. I thought that was just us and I was one of the weird ones with a need to travel everywhere. Right now, I can't even leave my own fucking STATE without filling out travel forms and doing a quarantine AND taking a damn covid test. I missed my yearly drive to see my Gramma last year. Probably gonna miss it again this year because I refuse to jump through these damn hoops! I'd absolutely move away from this hell state (NY) if I wasn't coparenting with my ex husband here, his home state. And I love this place and my job. I can't believe we are all going through this bull! I keep checking on my one Aussie friend out of Melbourne. He's hanging in there. He's far enough north that he's not super affected.</p>

        <p>That's the thing that amazes me most about Australians, and I guess people in general. The memory spans aren't particularly long. When the premier of Victoria was losing his mind, everyone in Melbourne seemed to come together and all shared the outrage. Now that a bit of time has passed, noone seems to remember what happened and they're all back on the mask train</p>
