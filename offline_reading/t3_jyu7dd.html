        <p>Agreed. This whole nonsense of limiting the healthy people with the "But we CANNOT TELL if they are infected!" is bullcrap because with ANY viral infection, you cannot tell if someone is infected until they start showing symptoms!</p>
<p>That is why the lockdown bockdown nonsense is royally stupid.</p>
<p>We need to start pushing back against this nonsense. CoVid-19 for the majority and this is with having my own parents die from it due to the negligence of a rehab center... is a MINOR illness.</p>
<p>A few coughs, a little chest pain (which by the way... some people have had with flus in the past 30 years), a little muscle weakness... and in 4 days the bulk are over it and fully recovered.</p>
<p>They are still trying to feed us "But it does PERMANENT damage!"</p>
<p>We have had flus and colds in the past that have done that. One of my third cousins in California in 2002 was rendered disabled due to a COLD.</p>
<p>Even Johns Hopkins Hospital, according to my doctor who works for Johns Hopkins Community Physicians and has access to their data, is saying long-haulers are 1 out of a thousand or less.</p>
<p>We simply did not need to shut down everything for this virus.</p>
<p>What we should have done is encourage people over 60, with pre-ex's and those who live with them to stay home by giving them full income replacements until we have a vaccine for this virus.</p>

        <p>Of course. A doctor anti lockdown said something along the lines of individuals are the only ones qualified to make decisions on how to handle themselves during this pandemic. Simply because of how different each person is.</p>

        <p>Purely by age alone you are in a higher risk category than most of the population. Would you be willing to do it in order to get herd immunity levels in the general population up?   </p>
<p>Personally I think people should be allowed to assess their own risk and decide what they can and can't do. But quarantine for high risk people seems a better option than the entire population.</p>

        <p>I would be willing to get a vaccine "for the team" (to boost herd immunity). I would not be willing to isolate as I have no known health issues, lead an active lifestyle, and travel a lot for work (not this year). I'm not sure how my isolating would help the population reach herd immunity, anyways.</p>

        <p>My condolences about your parents.</p>
<p>Post viral fatigue and the likes are nothing new as you say, my sister suffered some a few years ago (in her 20s) and it took her few months to fully recover, she wasn't bedridden as far as I remember just very fatigued for a month or so then slightly more fatigued than usual afterwards. She also didn't expect the world to stop for her. I am not sure who would want that honestly.</p>

I even work in a field where it runs rampant. (Two different facilities for people with developmental disabilities) Each year people I serve die or end up with trachs or on vents permanently.

<p>I started feeling sick on Friday afternoon.  Was in hell Saturday-Monday (took that day off).  Returned to work on Tuesday (boss demanded).  I could barely speak my throat was so sore and I was just pouring fluids out of my face lol.</p>
<p>Still, I stayed in my office, told everyone to keep their distance, touched nothing, and washed my hands all the time.</p>
<p>No one else in my company of 50 got sick.</p>

        <p>&rt;do you support mass mandatory testing </p>
<p>I don't support anything mandatory. Now if you have evidence that I carry a disease or I am infectious, contagious, a disease transmitter or any other disease decorative term, you have to..........prove it. Lets repeat this altogether. <strong>Prove it</strong>. Not only I refuse testing, I refuse any communication with anyone accusing me of carrying a disease. Obviously you don't negotiate with someone who wants to damage your health and accuses of things you've never done.</p>

        <p>Disagree, because if you test positive and are completely fine, then you must quarantine. Not about to lock myself away for 2 weeks when I’m completely fine and test may be a false positive anyway.</p>

        <p>One suggestion that I heard was from Sunetra Gupta, pointing out that we evacuated cities during the war. It couldn't be so hard to ship off high risk people to some hotels out of the cities, and would be a lot less damaging to the economy than this nonsense.</p>

        <p>&rt;you could have it and just not know</p>
<p>And that message is terrifying a not-insignificant part of the population. Hell it's how I felt in April/May. Voluntarily isolated because I had a cold. "Oh it could be COVID, I wouldn't want to kill someone." Was worried I had passed it on to, and potentially killed, some vulnerable relatives when I got sick a few days after seeing someone in their household.</p>
<p>I still see people thinking that way today. It's insanity. Overpowering fear that destroys your ability to think rationally.</p>
<p>It's sadistic to push that mindset on people for something like this.</p>

        <p>I disagree with a majority of the lockdown nonsense, but its important to understand that the reason everyone gets locked down is because anyone can be an asymptomatic carrier.  This argument isnt very useful because you dont know if youre "healthy" or not.</p>

        <p>If the government has evidence that a deadly virus was going on through out the country and putting many peoples lives in danger they have the right to limit face to face interaction to stop the spread and save people from dying and yes I do expect to get down voted but fake internet point me don’t matter to me so go right ahead</p>

        <p>If the government has evidence that a serial rapist is going about through the community, they have no right to lockdown all men, or even those who resemble that rapist. To restrict someone, they must show proof.</p>
<p>Is there danger with a rapist on the loose? Yes. Would it be safer for that hypothetical community if all men's movements and interactions were restricted? Yes. But that isn't how we operate as a nation. Our constitution protects the rights of everyone to walk free and pursue their own happiness.</p>

        <p>One, they may have evidence a virus is spreading, but they have no proof, especially given they do not even have a pure sample of this virus they say is so deadly (deadly, with over a 99% survival rate for those who they claim are infected with it?).</p>
<p>Two, they do not have the right to limit people's movement and invade their privacy because people have god-given rights. Not government-given rights, rights that are intrinsic and cannot be taken away because they are are ours through virtue of being born. Those rights outlined in the Constitution do not go away just because certain self-serving "experts" claim we are in a pandemic.</p>

        <p>That might actually make sense if we didn't know that there is almost zero asymptomatic spread.</p>

        <p>Sad to see you are down voted, as this sub seems to be pretty objective generally and what you say seems to be true (well in theory at least). But there are lots of other unknowns and I am not convinced that lockdowns are the way to achieve "limiting the spread", they are certainly a very ineffective way of doing that, looking at number form Peru for example.</p>

        <p>I believe they’re being downvoted because 1) lockdowns as you said, really do nothing but slow everything down 2) Tests can be false positives. 3) why should a completely functioning person that can continue on with life be locked away? Even with a minor cough we don’t do that. We can’t hide every time we are a little sick, especially when we are feeling completely fine...we can be a little more cautious around others, but no reason to quarantine ourselves unless showing the more obvious symptoms.</p>
