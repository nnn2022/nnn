    <strong>Is it possible that the virus has gotten less deadly over the last year?</strong>
    <p><p>We know viruses generally evolve to become less deadly over time. So why is that not being considered here? It seems like the death rate keeps falling. Now, that might be because early on we had poor estimates for how many people had this disease, but isn't it also possible that it's become less severe?</p>
<p>Why is no one talking about this as a possibility? Maybe because it ruins the lockdown / mask narrative??</p></p>

        <p>My mother and father would care to disagree with you about that, considering that they died due to this coronavirus and in BOTH cases, 8 doctors for each (adding up to 16 in all) said that if they had not gotten the CoVid-19 virus, they would still be alive and living with me in our home right now.</p>
<p>Yes, this shit is deadly to some people. End of discussion.</p>

        <p>One of the more intriguing theories I heard (although it doesnâ€™t seem like the most likely to me at this point) is that the virus was manipulated in a lab to be incredibly dangerous but was only meant to be used for research purposes. Except it got out. But since the virus only existed in a lab it was incredibly unstable in the wild and quickly mutated and mixed with wild viruses to become more stable but also far less dangerous.</p>
<p>This theory would explain some of the stuff we saw early on in China and Italy where it did seem like something dangerous was spreading.</p>

        <p>We still have it being deadly even now. We still have literal bodybuilders getting sick and having to be put on ventilators. We still have very young people getting sick with this virus and having to be put on ventilators.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that this is a lab-made virus and we have more and more evidence that this virus was going around IN THE UNITED STATES in Summer 2019.</p>
<p>It is a natural virus that just happened to hit what I call the "Hell spot" of being very infectious and very lethal to certain parts of the populace.</p>

        <p>Well supposedly it was already HIGHLY contagious in the beginning. We have 11million+ cases and with so many people being "asymptomatic" then we might have all had it already.</p>
