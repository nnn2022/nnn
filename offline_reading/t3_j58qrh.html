    <strong>[Rant] Friends and fams: Have you remembered using your mask?</strong>
    <p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Friends and fams asking if I wears masks all the time. I've sensory issues and have difficulty hearing what mask wearing people says. I want the old normal.</p>
<p>Every single day friends and fams ask me these questions.</p>
<p>"Have you remembered using your mask?"</p>
<p>"Have you remembered buying masks (that you pay yourself and costs $77)?"</p>
<p>"Would you wear your mask now?"</p>
<p>They're nagging about the mask all the times. Do X and Y, don't do this etc. It's like social control. I'm not from a religious and conservative middle eastern family, but it's expected to wear face covering because of the virus. I'm 20F years old and in college. I'm tired of friends and fams telling me what to do. Police can't enforce any laws because of fence sitting politicians. Yet family ask and ask.</p>
<p>I've sensory issues, but I rarely discuss with them. I'm not sure if they will understand and I don't want this to stand in the way for my education. No way I will quit school. I've autism, so I reacts badly on the way the mask smells, how it doesn't block out bad smells from places, sweats and that's hot. It makes communication harder. I can't hear my own voice when talking with the mask on. Neither can I hear what commoners says with a mask on. I can sometimes understand medical staffs if they risen their voice and writes down important details. Without mask I hear myself normally and everyone else when looking at them. Friends have told me I have great hearing pre-COVID19.</p>
<p>My ability to recognize, distinguish, remember voices and hearing intonation/inflection has worsen during the past, probably five years, while my ability to read whole body language and facial expression has stayed average like neurotypical people.</p>
<p>My friend and fams won't stop asking. They knows I'm using them and has seen me wearing it. Yet they ask, ask and ask. Do they use it themselves? I don't know. I've never seen them wearing it. Maybe because of it's not allowed when working with special need kids. I don't use masks when in class room or shops because of I refuse to. I only use them on public transportation. Society wants everyone to wear them. My country went from a liberal Scandinavian state to a face covering state. Although police can't fine you in all cities within my country because of different laws, you would be looked down upon if not wearing it.</p>
<p>Now I'm going "deaf" for society. I can't hear anything at all. I went from normal hearing to not understanding a word.</p></p>

<p>Have you seen a doctor about your hearing?</p>

        <p>It's a long waiting list and right now I'm prioritizing my teeth first. I've waited a year before dentists took my problem serious and the pain have lasted 6 months. I've four teeth. I'm going to get them fixed really soon if they can keep the promise this time after multiple delays.</p>
<p>There's long waiting lists and the doctors are prioritizing COVID19 people first, man. But I will soon get it checked.</p>

        <p>“No, I’m not sick.” You need to say “no” in life sometimes. It (usually) isn’t as bad to say no as you’d think.</p>
