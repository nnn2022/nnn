        <p>Hopsitals have been miserable for me to go to lately.</p>
<p>I had a MRI yesterday, had to wear a mask the whole time. I practically begged them to take it off, and while the technicians were apologetic, they didn't allow it, and said I'd need to leave if I took it off. So I was basically forced to go through with it. I had two different areas to check back to back, thus the MRI took two hours to complete too. </p>
<p>I've also noted a lot of medical staff seem paranoid about Covid. It boggles my mind that people with medical knowledge are actually this terrified of it. They're young too, and not in the age range to worry about it.</p>

<p>I visited a psychiatrist today.</p>
<p>When I entered his office, I was explicitly asked to disinfect my hands. When the psychiatrist gave me a pen, he disinfected the pen. And when leaving the office, I was asked to disinfect my hands yet again. I didn't bother to ask whether I could remove my mask, even though there was plexiglass between us.</p>
<p>There's something very ironic about a person responsible for other people's mental health acting like an OCD germaphobe. He must have though I was paranoid or something when I explained that I've been spending lots of time researching, talking about and writing on the Covid-19 hoax.</p>
<p>Oh the irony...</p>

        <p>Similarly to you, when I used a pen to fill out forms, they asked me to keep it. Then when I had to use a pen again, but forgot the other one, they handed me another, and told me to keep that one as well. Can you imagine how much waste in being produced due to stuff like this? </p>
<p>Also, I'm sure that psychiatrist judged you for being a "looney" just like many others do to us here. After all, the government just wants to help us, and they'll never change the way society is run permanently. No, no. We're going back to normal very soon... More goalpost pushing incoming.</p>

<p>Probably.</p>
<p>I don't care though...</p>
<p>The longer I can stay on a disability paycheck (which I got after falling into depression when I lost my job &amp; a 10 year long relationship back in April), the better for me right now.</p>
<p>No reason for me to hide anything that may make them think I'm more "normal" (whatever that means) than I really am...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;No, no. We're going back to normal very soon... More goalpost pushing incoming.</p>
<p>Totally.</p>
<p>Yet, only the "crazies" seem to notice.</p>
<p>Such a strange world we live in...</p>

<p>If masks weren't going to stick around, why bother with this contraption? Am I right? I mean, if the vaccine is "right around the corner", and masks were going to be dropped soon, then why have this thing set up?</p>

        <p>I don't think so.  I think that most people are uncomfortable thinking about that, they're holding onto some vague hope that the mask wearing will end eventually. They get agitated when you suggest that they'll still be be wearing them in 5 years.</p>

        <p>I remember asking a guy if he'd be okay wearing them in five years. He said he'd be fine with it if it meant it could save lives. I pointed out that he had a daughter, and wouldn't he miss seeing her smile. He then replied that he'd prefer not to see her smile if it meant she'd be alive and well. A lot of other people I've asked these sort of questions to have given me similar answers. It's unsettling.</p>

        <p>If it comes to pass that the masks are permanent that'll be it for me.  I'll buy as much land as I can, as far a away from civilization as I can get.  I have the means, I just live in a city because it used to offer benefits.  Now it offers none.  I'd rather remove myself from society (as much as possible) than live with the masks.</p>

        <p>They're not going to allow that. The leaks from the Canadian government had an excerpt that they plan to go after dissenters, and put them in their isolation camps until they comply. They plan to abolish private property, so they're gonna be on the lookout for people living on their own land. I'm sure the governments of the world will have task forces designed to patrol secluded areas for people they can grab, and sack into those camps. It'd be very difficult to actually escape that, if it comes to pass. (So far the leaks have been scarily accurate, with more lockdowns happening all over the world including Canada and the US...)</p>

        <p>You don't seem to get my point.</p>
<p>They've been saying stuff like "This will only go on for a little longer" since April, each time they continue to push the goalposts as to when the masks will go away (and still haven't given us any end dates for these security measures either).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they do things like install machinery like this that's meant to have a longterm use. Why make them in the first place if this isn't supposed to last very long?</p>
<p>Also, sure, they can dismantle them whenever they want to, but it seems like they are intending/predicting this will go on for a long time.</p>

        <p>They can install whatever they want, if it turns out there's no use for it 3 months from now, they'll either repurpose it, sell it, or shelve it. Same story with field hospitals.</p>
<p>Someone expressed the same concerns about floor stickers a while back and told them they may look permanent, but all it takes is for someone to rip it off the floor and it won't be replaced.</p>
