    <strong>Who's sick to death of being gaslighted every month?</strong>
    <p><p>In September they said they'd have more updates in October.</p>
<p>In October we heard that the big news got delayed to November.</p>
<p>In November they were trying to gauge if we would open in December.</p>
<p>In December we locked down and were told that January could be a fresh new start.</p>
<p>In January it turns out we were still "figuring" out how to deal with getting over December.</p>
<p>In February they talked about maybe finally reopening by March and the "experts" agreed.</p>
<p>In March there was a twist of fate and we learned that we had to lock down until April.</p>
<p>In April there was a lot of discussion about what to do which was dragged on into May.</p>
<p>In May it was finally decided that everything had to be postponed to June.</p>
<p>We're going into June now and we're already hearing about how maybe things will open back up in July.</p>
<p>If you haven't got it by now. THEN YOU JUST AIN'T GETTING IT. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦</p></p>

        <p>The trolls around here are my primary source of resistance. I'm pretty well insulated from any of the nonsense. I work with one guy, out of about twenty, that has been vaccinated and he just went along with it too appease his mother in law. I know one of my nephews and my father in law got vaccinated but that's it. There were a couple of shows I liked (this is us, and a million little things) that got too invested in the agenda for me. Otherwise my life hasn't changed much. Work has continued and we already homeschooled. Can't imagine dealing with this in more typical circumstances.</p>
