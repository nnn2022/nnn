    <strong>Vaccine Shedding Question</strong>
    <p><p>According to Pfizer, it is POSSIBLE that these injections shed- it is referred to as "Occupational Exposure" in their study (on dosages)</p>
<p>It's a long one, but the info pertaining to this is on pgs 67-69:</p>
<p><a href="https://media.tghn.org/medialibrary/2020/11/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol_Nov2020_Pfizer_BioNTech.pdf#page67">https://media.tghn.org/medialibrary/2020/11/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol_Nov2020_Pfizer_BioNTech.pdf#page67</a></p>
<p>According to the National Institutes of Health, self-disseminating vaccines have existed since 2016:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4732410/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4732410/</a> </p>
<p>So my question is has anyone here experienced side effects by being in close, intimate contact with someone who's had the jab?</p>
<p>Why would they be SO insistent on vaccinating everyone and doing boosters every 6 months if they just spread themselves anyway? </p>
<p>Why would the "elites" want this if it's possible it'll just spread to them too?</p>
<p>I'm curious to hear about your experiences.</p></p>

        <p>This is what woke me up in April. The one person I hang out with got it and I hung out with her the day after her shot. My crotch didn't "feel right" the next day and i proceeded to gush blood for 2 weeks straight then it suddenly stopped instead of fading away. It felt just like a second trimester miscarriage. Lost all my muscle mass. Hard core depression and hopelessness. Tested negative for covid. I don't have uterine cancer/stds/pcos/ or use birth control. I don't work with the public or come into contact with coworkers. I really really didn't want to believe it was the "vaccines" fault.</p>

        <p>Damn. That's hardcore.</p>
<p>I hope things go back to normal for you, I really do. </p>
<p>I kissed a guy in march. Had no idea he was vaxxed since he was saying whatever he thought I wanted to hear. My period was 10 days late - ZER0 chance of pregnancy (he didn't get that far) next month it was normal, this time was early and light and spotty. I had no idea "shedding" was a possibility until after things got all weird in that department, so it wasn't psychosomatic. </p>
<p>Apparently immunocontraceptive vaccines have been researched since the 90s.</p>

<p>I hope every last person responsible for this is tried for crimes against humanity and hanged. I really do.</p>

        <p>I got sick the next day after hanging out with someone who'd gotten the vaccine the day before. Very, very sick. </p>
<p>The hospital i went to said i had mono and strep, and it lasted FOREVER. </p>
<p>But nobody else I'd come into contact with ever got sick. </p>
<p>Can't confirm 100%, obviously, but you don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to piece it together.</p>

        <p>My parents took my kids for a weekend after they got vaccinated.  When the kids came back, my wife and I both got very intense, brief headaches and one shot diarrhea. Been keeping an eye on it but no further effects and my parents have had the kids since. So... maybe. Maybe not.</p>

        <p>I work 40+ hours a week at a grocery store that grosses millions annually. This place is busy nonstop, literally morning to night, along with the pharmacy that has been administering all three vaccines. (Ive seen two people require EMTS after receiving their shots btw) I’ve been here roughly 2 1/2 months...so far, I’ve had three wildly different and irregular periods (I’m not on birth control, not having sex, so nothing on my end to induce change) and this week experienced intense chest pains, directly over my heart, bad enough to leave work. Began about two weeks ago and peaked this past Wednesday. An EKG at an urgent care recorded definite anomaly, but I didn’t go to the ER for a full work up and by Friday the pain subsided. I’m a healthy 33 year old, and I honestly thought I was having a heart attack. Never experienced anything close to that in my life. Correlations noted.</p>

        <p>My wife has had abnormal menstrual cycles since her whole family has been vaccinated save for me, her, and my 2 month old son. He was sick for a few days (nothing major thankfully, he had also had his normally scheduled vaccines a week prior, so that could have been it). Besides my wife’s menstrual cycle being heavier than normal, obviously she just gave birth and this is her first one since so we don’t know for sure; she currently has a scratchy throat and felt very sick yesterday but feeling better today. I haven’t felt anything, but I rarely do. So who knows:/</p>

        <p>Biologist Pamela Acker, who acknowledges the dangers of the Covid-19 injections, argues that spike protein shedding or shedding of replication-defective viral vectors isn't a thing. Only live attenuated viruses can be shed; the same goes for self-spreading vaccines.</p>
