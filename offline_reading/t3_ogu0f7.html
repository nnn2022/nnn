    <strong>People seem more "dead inside" recently? What's happened?</strong>
    <p><p>There appears to be a dark shift in the tone of social interactions recently. It might just be me, but people don't act human. They're cold. They're lifeless. Their eyes have no spirit. They talk like robots.</p>
<p>People don't give the reaction humans usually give during interactions, like half arsed small talk or "nice weather" pleasantries and then move on quickly. Not even that. People just seem... dead. Or in some haze. It's like their consciousness is gone.</p>
<p>I'm being a bit dark and poetic here so don't take my descriptions as literal. But seriously, there's something wrong with people right now.</p>
<p>What's caused this? Is it the trauma of the past year? Is it the vaccines that have done something to their mind or soul (if you believe in that).</p></p>

        <p>I have noticed this too. It is likely the collective stress of what they did to this nation - this globe - for a year and a half now...</p>
<p>However, my dad got the Pfizer and ... He just isn't himself. I don't know how else to put it except that it's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</p>
<p>He's physically there and has his old memories but there's no "human" there and I feel entirely disconnected from him. In my mind it's like he already died because the dad I once knew is gone. :-/</p>

        <p>I feel so disconnected from my dad too. We were so very close and discussing spiritual things for hours, ever since the Pzifer he turned his back on all of that and became obsessed with losing weight and avoids deeper conversations, maybe it's not correlated but it's making me guess what part of the brain it affects. I have this weird grief for losing the only person who I could talk to about spirituality and the deeper layers of life. It all feels so weird</p>

        <p>Likely depends where you are.  Here in Ontario we are in the midst of a never-ending lockdown - it was illegal to get a haircut here until last week.  Still no gyms.  No indoor dining.  No casinos.  Ridiculous line-ups everywhere.  It is no mystery here why a lot of people are absolutely miserable.</p>

        <p>They live in FEAR.</p>
<p>Went to my grocery store today. 90% Masked shopping last time, 100% Masked this time.</p>
<p>All of them were looking at me in fear and surprise.</p>
<p>No Mask mandates, but the fear remains.</p>
<p>Yet, as even as I kept social distance as courtesy, The Masked had no problem breaking distance with me.. Their behaviour is always so odd, but their actions don't ever seem to match their concerns.</p>

        <p>You described me. </p>
<p>Why am I like that? Because I honestly feel disheartened talking to vaxxed zombies. I'm always on my toes incase they ask me iF i gOt mY sEcOnD dOsE. I have no desire to speak with people who will drone about the covid vaccine...I don't trust them. I am cold and hollow to them, other times when I try to be nice and crack PC jokes with them I am always nervous on the inside about the political atmosphere and propaganda going on in society right now. I hear the word "vaccine" and "second dose" around my office constantly...I feel like I'm crossing a desert full of land mines.</p>

        <p>So Iâ€™m a firm believer in vaccines, but an even firmer believer in the choice of getting it or not. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here. I think theyâ€™re safe and 100% ethical but itâ€™s for a virus that I might not even know I have therefore I feel no need to get poked. I donâ€™t believe for one second itâ€™s causing people to think and act differently, it literally just produces antibodies artificially. I think people are just starting to see how fucked up the world is truly. The earth is dying and we have no means of reversal and no means of fixing it. Debt and inflation is at and all time high, and the market is going to crash soon. The world is just grim as fuck. On top of that people have dedicated their lives at this point to attributing their political views to their personality, which is causing people to hate one another and alienate each other. I just try to spread as much love as I can, because we all need it, and I guarantee everyone you see is going through something right now, I know I am.</p>

        <p>Pretty good post but what are you talking about the earth dying? That sounds like a common generalization based on years and years of hearing the same stuff.</p>
<p>We all do it but I've pulled myself off that accepting pile and decided I'd probably be smarter to be a skeptic of anything that the media and academia drones on about.</p>

        <p>Being a skeptic is fine but so is knowing when to believe what is right in front of you. Have you been outside, seen global temperatures? If c02 was 0.03% which is a fact, and then moves to 0.04% (also a fact); what exactly are you arguing here? Just that was enough to change the global temperature. The last time that happened was from a major volcanic explosion. And thatâ€™s such a small takeaway from my broader point. Why are you nitpicking something that isnâ€™t even a debate anymore. You donâ€™t believe in vaccines cool but dude cmon</p>

        <p>So your whole angle here is that the C02 is increasing therefore the earth is being destroyed? The earth has had many many many swings of natural variety over however long this rock has been spinning.</p>
<p>We don't even have accurate temp data from just 200 years ago. There are many people who predict mass extinction and rising sea levels if we get to an arbitrary number, although that number was chosen why? There isn't a magic number.</p>
<p>When you look at things in terms of who gains, things start to be obvious. Everything to do with climate change comes at the detriment of personal freedom. It comes at the benefit of big government. Look through pages and pages of previous "experts" talking about inevitable disaster dating back to the 1970's. The stuff they were fearmongering about never happened.</p>
<p>The genius John Kerry even said that by 2050 if we are carbon neutral that wont be enough and we will have to do something to take more carbon out of the air. Lol.</p>
<p>If you still think this is just a crisis that is for our own good. Have a good time with that.</p>
