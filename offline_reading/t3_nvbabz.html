        <p>There was NEVER any science to support vaccinating people who already had it.</p>
<p>So what was the real reason they pushed those people to get the jab?</p>

        <p>Protecting and expanding current and future pharmaceutical industry revenue.</p>
<p>It's critical to the revenue of the pharmaceutical industry that everybody believe their bodies are incapable of even sustaining life without subscribing to 6 to 12 or so of their products forever.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that State governments are stakeholders in the so-called "healthcare sector" from investing their retirement accounts, rainy day funds, slush funds, etc.</p>
<p>There are a LOT of other stakeholders and affiliates as well, all of whom have vested fiscal self-interests in the "healthcare sector" expanding their return on investment.</p>

        <p>The fact that you felt threatened enough to check my goddamn profile speaks a lot about you lmfao. Get a grip  </p>
<p>&rt; Glad I did as I will not waste my time debating you.</p>
<p>I think you misunderstand. There’s no debate here. There’s an uneducated fool in an echo-chamber and someone who’s pointing that out.</p>
<p>&rt; May I suggest you go back to playing your games and let the adults talk about the science.</p>
<p>The absolute audacity to act like you’re superior when you’re in an echo chamber pushing pseudoscience is not lost on me. How about you let the professionals talk about science instead of being so foolish you think your delusional notions pass for “science“</p>
<p>&rt; And yes, we are "crazy" for believing in our immune systems and reading scientific literature.</p>
<p>Not surprised to see you immediately strawman me considering you had to check my profile to get something on me. You’re not crazy, you’re fucking insane. You know why? You straight-up believe you know more than the entire medical community and its consensus. You trust people on the internet over your own goddamn doctor. </p>
<p>Also, for the record, you don’t believe in scientific literature, or you would not be in this subreddit. Scientific literature supports the notion that masks are necessary (ask your surgeon to forego a mask when he does an open surgery on you :)), covid vaccines are safe, COVID is a real threat, and you’re a fool.</p>
<p>&rt; Someone grab me a straight jacket and lock me up!!!</p>
<p>I genuinely wish I could to prevent you from spreading your ignorance and lunacy lmfao.</p>

<p>Check the RCT studies before you make a qoute like this. "The science" does not support this statement. May I also advise you take a look at Fauci's latest emails and see what he said about cloth mask. The science didn't change and we have yet know why he changed his opinion </p>

<p>Would be great if you linked those studies. I have a feeling you’re spinning them or they’re mocked by the scientific community though. Here’s mine:</p>

<p>&rt; The science didn't change and we have yet know why he changed his opinion. May I also advise you take a look at Fauci's latest emails and see what he said about cloth mask.</p>
<p>He explained why. You can pretend he’s lying if you want. And I did. Once again, you show your scientific illiteracy.</p>
<p>1) he was talking about cloth masks, not surgical masks (filtered and different materials)</p>
<p>2) scientists had concluded that the leaky nature of the masks led them the more common cloth ones at the time to be useless. This opinion changed as scientists noted a lot of covid spread came exclusively from water droplets caught on cloth masks.</p>
<p>&rt; Another widely inaccurate statement.</p>
<p>Can’t even spell so I’m not shocked you’re too incompetent to defend your position. You didn’t elaborate because you and I both know you can’t.</p>
<p>You ignored everything else in my comment because you’re too goddamn stubborn and delusional to come to terms with the fact that your entire worldview is based on BS and lies. So you ignore everything to the contrary of what you believe. It’s sad.</p>
<p>&rt; It's pretty late. I don't want to keep you past your bedtime. Make sure you give your mom a hug nd kiss before you head to sleep. Also, may I have your Fortnite tag? My niece is always looking for some new players. LMAO 🤣</p>
<p>I haven’t been in that subreddit for some time, I’m an engineer. I love how you’re trying to mock me for my age in a desperate attempt to deflect from the pathetic nature of your argument but you just end up coming off as immature and pathetic.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why I’m wasting my time with someone who’s opinions clearly come from pure ignorance.</p>
