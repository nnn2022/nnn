    <strong>Stop using RT-PCR to diagnose covid19</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;In light of our findings that more than half of individuals with positive PCR test results are unlikely to have been infectious, RT-PCR test positivity should not be taken as an accurate measure of infectious SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Our results confirm the findings of others that the routine use of “positive” RT-PCR test results as the gold standard for assessing and controlling infectiousness fails to reflect the fact “that 50-75% of the time an individual is PCR positive, they are likely to be post-infectious” </p>
<p>The inventor, before he died, argued it wasn't good for diagnosis.</p>
<p>&rt;An increase in Ct value of three points indicates that the initial amount of viral particles was smaller by a factor of about ten. </p>
<p>&rt;symptomatic subjects had a markedly lower mean Ct value of 25.5 compared to asymptomatic subjects, who showed a mean Ct value of 29.6</p>
<p>Each cycles doubles the amplification. So this gap is bigger than it might seem. From theory the body is unlikely to shed viral load when you are asymptomatic.</p></p>

        <p>Actually I'd say they are completely useless...  zero unvaccinated people have ever had the covid virus found/isolated in them.  None. Nada. Zilch.  Kary mullis was dead on , PCR is useless to detect any infections.</p>
