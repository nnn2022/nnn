        <p>That is bad argument because in the long run since you are almost 100% likely to get COVID unless you severely self isolated which comes with its own cost, you do actually choose between virus and vaccine. It doesn't matter that you actually take one consciously and the other not, because you actually choose between these two.</p>

        <p>That is irrelevant. People here blame those that say, take the vaccine even though my mother possibly died from it, while they see no problem with those that say the similar - my someone dear died from COVID yet get COVID it is not serious. </p>
<p>Actually, simply put like this, there seems to be no difference between those that advocate for something that is known to cause harm, even though those are different things. Vaccines cause harm without doubt, in some people, just like the virus, causes harm, without doubt, in some people. We know engaging in traffic, causes harm in some of those that take part in it, however, we don't say to people that they shouldn't take part in traffic because someone we know died in it. </p>
<p>The question is, why? Well, simple as it is, because we assume and take for granted that the risk is low and benefit from accepting the risk higher than trying to avoid the risk itself.</p>
<p>So as regards to vaccines, they are risky but also not taking them is risky, because you expose your self to higher probability of contracting the virus, which is also risky. The question is, what is riskier.</p>
<p>So I'm asking you people here, reading this. Is it riskier to take the vaccine or not take it and live your life with higher probability of getting COVID?</p>

<p>Taking the vaccine. My entire family hasn't had covid. I've traveled to Laos during the pandemic, had to go through Thailand then laos, I work with patients (mri) and I go to the gym.</p>
<p>I haven't been sick. I'm young and I have an immune system. I don't need beer or donut to be bribed.</p>
<p>I had patients come in for vaccine related issues. No thanks.</p>
<p>My question for you is. Why do you trust your 3, 4 letter government agencies?</p>

        <p>Seriously, you’re trying to teach us about risk evaluation? My answer is already above. I have an immune system, it works. </p>
<p>I don’t want unapproved drugs in my body. You shouldn’t either. You are repeating the same point you already made. </p>
<p>One is a virus that I already had and didn’t notice, the other is man made unapproved drug that they have been trying to get approved for 15 years but our institutions don’t let them because it causes all sorts of problems and it isn’t very effective. I already did my own risk evaluation. There is no question about what conclusion an informed individual would come to but nobody is informed anymore.</p>

        <p>&rt;. I have an immune system, it works. </p>
<p>No shit, who would've guessed, huh? Everybody has immune system as long as he is alive. And guess what, it works always too, just not the way you would want it to work, sometime. If you didn't have immune system no vaccine would work, I think you should know this.</p>
<p>&rt;I don’t want unapproved drugs in my body. You shouldn’t either. You are repeating the same point you already made. </p>
<p>First of all, calling something unapproved drug doesn't make it somehow bad. Second of all, it is approved, but there are different forms of approval.</p>
<p>&rt;One is a virus that I already had and didn’t notice, the other is man made</p>
<p>So man made things are inherently more detrimental than natural ones? Right? As long as something is man made there is no necessity for it to be further examined, it is worse than natural things?</p>
<p>&rt;unapproved drug that they have been trying to get approved for 15 years but our institutions don’t let them because it causes all sorts of problems and it isn’t very effective</p>
<p>First of all, it hasn't been tried to be approved, it has been tested and under development for that period. There was no opportunity for it to "shine".</p>
<p>Second of all, it doesn't cause all sorts of problems, that is false, otherwise, you would be able to link me evidence for those, all sorts of problems, right? I guess you would that's why I'm asking you know to provide me with evidence.</p>
<p>Third of all, it is effective, pretty much. Otherwise, you have evidence to the contrary?</p>

        <p>One demands active compliance with authority while the other advocates freedom. You can say that it is a guarantee that someone will get the virus if they're not vaccinated. But having already had it I'd rather take my chances with the fairy tale of reinfection</p>

        <p>I see where you're coming from and I agree that it's the same logic. I can't imagine changing my opinion on covid and the new authoritarian normal, no matter what happens to me. I hate the present situation with every fibre of my being and even if I was on my deathbed due to covid, I wouldn't change my views.</p>
<p>So I can understand where the vaccine pushers are coming from as well. It's just that I don't like coercion and I don't believe complete strangers should have the right to tell me what to inject myself with or discriminate me based on my decision. That's the difference I guess. I'm not imposing my views on anyone and I'm not advocating for completely reshaping society because I'm afraid. I also don't have the mainstream media on my side. The other side is much more authoritarian than us. If the vaccine wasn't pushed on us so aggressively, I wouldn't care more about vaccine side effects than I care about bad reactions to hair dye or face cream.</p>
