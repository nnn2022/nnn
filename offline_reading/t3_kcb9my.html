        <p>I was the type that never wished to wear one, I ended up caving once (sorta) but I learned my lesson; give an inch they'll try to take a mile.</p>
<p>I caved and wore one just over my mouth to a drs appointment to see if I have uterine cancer , I was told that I could not be seen if I didn't cover my nose. I had my nose uncovered for a legit reason, I have asthma - I was born with it. </p>
<p>Well when I first got back in the room the kind lady that took my info and my vitals never once mentioned how I wore the mask. She told me the nurse would be coming in soon and that I should fully undress. Well the rude nurse that had the issue with me not being able to cover my nose pretty much told me she would not see me unless I did. At that point I was caught off guard because I was completely naked and only had a gown to hide myself. I told her swiftly the truth that I had asthma she literally did not care, she was stone cold about the situation. So I sadly tried to comply, as I covered my nose and made my way to the other room to empty my bladder as she wanted I began to walk funny and get faint. By the time I got in the bathroom I hyperventilated and went into a full blown panic attack. The only person who ever came to check on me was the kind lady who took my vitals, I never saw the rude nurse again. </p>
<p>So yea , what did I get for complying? Or well trying to... Absolutely nothing but embarrassment, and I ended up having to leave while heaving and sobbing never knowing if I have uterine cancer or not. I made up my mind that day, never again will I ever put a diaper on my face! I'll do natural cures and pray for my healing. </p>
<p>At the time (tmi) I was bleeding all the way through, I'd maybe have a week in between free of bleeding but anytime I had relations with my husband I'd start to bleed more. Thankfully my hubby being into natural cures, he found me some things that so far are working! He found this native American herbal tea mix that has honestly seemed to work, it appears my bleeding has started to become regular. I've also been megadosing vitamins etc.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry to hear that. I call them face diapers as well. I have no breathing or psychological issues, but I have a lot of trouble wearing a mask over my nose for work. I had a full blown panic attack and hyperventilated as well. My boss let me wear it just over my mouth as often as needed. We even had to wear face shields too and we are a private office of around ten people and not open to the public at all. Now it's just "wear one when you're moving about". </p>
<p>I started having weird period issues a few years ago. Pre menopause I reckon. I had to stop taking birth control because the bleeding was heavy and irregular. I found some herbs online that helped tremendously. Maca root helped regulate my periods. And Vitex helped with the overly exaggerated ovulation pain I experience. I bet that tea is adaptogenic as well.</p>

        <p>I think the OP paragraph is misleading because it relies on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/hosvhw/an_updated_critique_of_the_twopronged_idea_that_a/">the false presumption that masks work</a>. If masks work and you are wearing one, that would be risk-aversion. If masks don't work and you are still wearing one, that would be stupidity, pure, simple, unadulterated stupidity.</p>

        <p>In this terrible example the assumption is made that people wear masks because their government tells them to and not because they understand that weâ€™re in a pandemic and wearing a mask saves lives. No one is going to wear a mask for no reason just because their government asks them to.</p>

        <p>Except that a lot of people are doing just that since in Florida we have about the same amount of cases adjusted for populace as Maryland.</p>
<p>Florida does not require masks.</p>
<p>Maryland does.</p>
<p>Ergo, masks do not work from the evidence in the first sentence.</p>

        <p>you're doing it because your authorities told you to, and for no other reason. If you had the thought independently you would've already taken the initiative to wear your mask to protect against other illnesses, where it's just as helpful and matters just as little. You invent a story about how sincere your motives are, after the fact, because you're psychologically weak, and you can't bear the acknowledgment of your weakness. End of story, your failure to wear masks earlier is definitive evidence.</p>
