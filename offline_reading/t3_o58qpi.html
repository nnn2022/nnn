    <strong>I want our lives back to normal</strong>

        <p>I feel you. I feel increasing angry at this psyop that is being inflicted on us. Anyone who doesnâ€™t see that this is all part of a bigger movement is in a coma. I wish I could just run out and get vaccinated and say Whoopie life is normal again yay! But once you see there is a very dark undercurrent going on you cannot unsee it. </p>
<p>IMO this is all part of a bigger movement. The virus, critical race theory/cultural Marxism, the breakdown of our economy, the middle class and small businesses, the insane degree of censorship now, the control over our movement and activities, who we talk to what we are allowed to say publicly...itâ€™s all part of a stealth movement to impose a repressive sort of communism on us. Add in the erosion of the nuclear family , disintegration of trust between races and this is all part of the same movement. We are having our bodily autonomy, freedom of thought and speech and movement and our self respect taken away from us more and move daily. </p>
<p>Things will get uglier I think . People donâ€™t remember how to do the things that made America (thatâ€™s where I am) great...hard work, community, trust, shared values etc. this is big. People arenâ€™t seeing the big picture which is exactly what our government wants. Everyone is distracted by the latest story of a drag Queen reading to a 4 year old, the latest death count, the latest assault or murder, the vaccine push ....I pray more and more people start using their brains and really really thinking about what all of this is. We are more powerful than the forces that are controlling us right now but not if they keep us fighting and hating one another. Divide and conquer and fear is keeping us docile and controlled. They want us poor, fat, depressed and obedient.  </p>
<p>To anyone who thinks Iâ€™m crazy and paranoid I wish I could think like you because seeing all of this is painful and Iâ€™d like to go back to being oblivious but I cannot unsee these things now.</p>

        <p>I do think eventually we will come through this and things will be OK but not right now. We still have some very tough times ahead of us. There was a concert here at Madison Square Garden last night and only vaccinated people were allowed in. Iâ€™m sure a lot of those people would call me a loser and say thatâ€™s what you get for not getting the vaccine you donâ€™t get to have fun! To them I say I could go the rest of my life never going to a concert or getting on a plane or eating out again if thatâ€™s what it takes to not participate in this type of world. Seeing all of them packed in, A sea of vaccinated people who did exactly what the government ordered them to do made me so deeply sad. If we were living in a society where there wasnâ€™t such pressure and stigma on it it wouldnâ€™t have been such a big deal to me but the fact that people use this as some sort of symbolism for being a good person and a good citizen and following orders and theyâ€™re perfectly OK with this medical caste system weâ€™re living in now, that honestly made me sick. And if that concert only allowed unvaccinated people in I would fight for their right as vaccinated people to get in as well. Thatâ€™s what this is about. People that are buying into all of this are unable to think clearly and they canâ€™t have a normal rational discussion. They are absolutely convinced we are insane selfish murderers and there is just no talking to them at all. </p>
<p>I do think eventually the truth is going to come out, history is going to be rewritten. A lot of people who supported this are probably going to Memory hole a lot of their behavior. I think there will be some people that will admit they were wrong, or things were not what they thought it was. I had two friends say to me over the weekend that they really admired me because I changed my initial position on this from a year ago to where I am now. My opinions and my feelings about it started changing last may so a little over a year ago. I realized something was off and I was willing to admit I was wrong. And I work in healthcare so I do know a little bit about medicine.</p>

        <p>I also live in NY. Iâ€™m upstate. Some places are worse than others up here. I appreciate people like you. I think it was April 2020 when I started freaking out and I lost a bunch of friends for openly saying what I saw coming. Somehow there are still people in my life who disagree with me, and think Iâ€™m a bad person when theyâ€™ve seen me predict almost everything that happened.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m afraid itâ€™s going to get much worse before it gets better. Although, just as history repeats itself for the bad times, it repeats itself for the good times as well. Eventually I think there will be another revolution, but I donâ€™t know if it will be in my lifetime. Enough people have to experience the tyranny firsthand and get really fed up with it for something to happen. Right now weâ€™re still way in the early stages and people are literally advocating for their own oppression.</p>

        <p>Sadly I think you are right. Part of me hopes that life will be normal and good again before I die but I'm middle-aged at this point and I don't see it happening. Maybe things will accelerate and we will push through all of this? I just don't know but I know it's going to get worse. Not enough people see what this really is because it's not affecting them. It's going to take them hurting to really see what this is.</p>

        <p>Yeah Iâ€™m in my 20s and Iâ€™m not even sure if it will be in my lifetime, but I hope it is. People donâ€™t appreciate what they have and theyâ€™re so privileged they have no idea what itâ€™s like to actually struggle. They advocate for their own oppression because they do not understand what it means. Unfortunately I think you are right, they wonâ€™t understand until they are personally affected. And even then I think there are some who are so self-righteous they will never admit they were wrong. </p>
<p>Donâ€™t get me wrong, Iâ€™ve never truly struggled either. The only difference is that Iâ€™m very grateful for all my freedoms and donâ€™t want to lose them. I hope more and more people keep waking up because this is all entirely one big coordinated plan for total control.</p>

        <p>I wish we could mobilize before it gets so bad we get to that breaking point. We all love our collective comforts too much, I think. And the mind-control, even us who can see it are victims of it, because we feel isolated and alone, and maybe run into one sane person who thinks like we do a day if we are lucky... We need to plan actions... but we are like the organism in the dish being poked by the scientist... they have planned their moves for decades and studied us for millennia... so we must pray for a catalyst or action that spurs us into action. We can't sit idly by while they steal the future of humanity... America is clearly the only western nation showing glimpses of freedom. We need to fucking ride the wave and as soon as we get legislatures and governors and states saying we are free we need to be free and never relinquish it again. Never again submit to lockdown or masks.... we need to use our power! <br>
"I know no safe depository of the ultimate powers of the society but the people themselves ; and if we think them not enlightened enough to exercise their control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform their discretion by education. This is the true corrective of abuses of constitutional power."<br>

        <p>Take a break from Reddit and news when not out in the middle of it and it helps a lot. Speaking from experience. I was just reading too much about it. Meanwhile most people in my community could care less and the vaccine rate is only 47% for the whole county. And thatâ€™s whatâ€™s really important, my local surroundings.</p>

        <p>I read my city newspaper which had the figure 53% of Guilford county is unvaccinated. Not sure if local media has less of a voice in CA. Wish I knew more. Iâ€™d imagine in the US the journalist got the data from state health organization or CDC.</p>
