    <strong>They blame the public, but defend the government</strong>
    <p><p>How in the holy hell can people claim that this is in no way the governments fault because they are not in control of the virus. When in their next breath they blame the "stupid covidiots" for the spread because they don't follow rules. </p>
<p>If the government can't control it, and you believe that enough to defend their life changing and damaging restrictions - how can you not see that your average joe also doesn't have that ability.</p>
<p>A virus is going to virus. No matter how many precautions you take. Unless you hide away in a clean room for the rest of your days, which is impossible, then you will always have a chance of catching it. Through no fault of anyone! </p>
<p>Remember people, the restrictions were originally placed to stop the NHS from being overwhelmed. It was NEVER to stop the spread. It was never announced that by following the rules that people would not be infected. So stop thinking that is the case. Stop throwing blame out left, right and centre at innocent people who are also being affected by the stupid measures the GOVERNMENT are putting in place.</p></p>
