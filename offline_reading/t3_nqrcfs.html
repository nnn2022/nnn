    <strong>The ignoring of naturally acquired immunity</strong>
    <p><p>One of the most anti science things we've been seeing over these past few months is that public health officials have been completely ignoring natural immunity (people who have already had and recovered from covid) and have been strongly pushing for everyone to get vaccinated regardless.  This is what the CDC has to say on their website: "Yes, you should be vaccinated regardless of whether you already had COVID-19. That’s because experts do not yet know how long you are protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19."  This is an unscientific bias against existing naturally acquired covid immunity.  It's of course also unknown how long vaccinated covid immunity will last.  We do know that as of March the CDC estimated that 114.6 million Americans (more than a third of the population) had already had and recovered from covid and that there have been statistically insignificant numbers of reinfections.  Science is definitely showing that natural immunity is effective.  Science has also shown that the vaccines are effective.  Vaccines or naturally acquired immunity work.  We have no business peer pressuring drugs onto people and discriminating against people who choose to stick with natural immunity and not get this vaccine.  Public health officials are not counting towards overall herd immunity goals the more than 114.6 million Americans who already have effective existing natural immunity.  They only count vaccinations.  This is absolutely unscientific and it leaves us with a skewed perception of the severity of things and has us pressuring this emergency use authorization vaccine onto people who do not need to get it.  The popular catch phrase "follow the science" means nothing more than "do not question authority and do not question hand picked public health officials who make policy recommendations that are unscientifically biased in favor of the financial benefit of massive multinational pharmaceutical corporations".  Furthermore the term "anti-vaxxer" has become nothing more than a bigoted slur that is being used to sideline and censor and group together anyone who has even a small difference of opinion on vaccine recommendations.  There are many fantastic credentialed doctors and scientists who have voiced their disagreements with the government and CDC.  They are just not given mainstream attention.  Here are a couple of great podcast clips with a John Hopkins MD and a University of California MD on exactly this topic of ignoring natural immunity:   </p>

        <p>There is no money to be made from naturally acquired immunity.</p>
<p>Vaccines, on the other hand, generate billions in annual revenues.</p>
<p>Yes, it really is that simple.</p>

        <p>I’ve wondered the same often.</p>
<p>Also with vaccines being in such short supply, it makes even less sense to give it to those who already have immunity due to prior infection.</p>

        <p>I got COVID over a year ago, before vaccines were available and with little to no work began incessantly reading studies about my infection-induced immunity.  Discussing it and what numerous studies were finding, namely that infection induced immunity was long-lasting and robust(meaning they had a good chance of protecting against variants, which has now been studied and demonstrated) has gotten me banned from several subs.  But, here are a couple of good ones:</p>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2777898?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=content-shareicons&amp;utm_content=article_engagement&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=032021#.YFYY0Aj3zck.facebook">JAMA</a> (from a letter published 03.21.21)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2">MedRXiv</a> can’t find a date on this one, and mind that it is a preprint, so not yet peer-reviewed but the institution that conducted the study is not one to snuff at.  </p>
<p>Many many studies have shown that it infected immunity, antibodies in the short-term and t/b-cells in the long term, are proving to offer not significantly different levels of protection than vaccines, and as the Cleveland Clinic study suggests, vaccination won’t offer you much added protection if at all if you’ve already had covid.</p>
