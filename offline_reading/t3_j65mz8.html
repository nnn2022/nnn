    <strong>My Perception Of Things $ My Story</strong>
    <p><p>Hey there everyone,
I hope you’re all powering through the sh*t show that’s the world that’s been lit on fire inside the belly of the beast; or at least a lot better than I have been. I’ve been lurking on all the anti-hivemind subs regarding the rona since May but haven’t honestly felt brave enough to even leave a comment until a couple nights ago for the first time. However I can’t take it anymore and even if I end up on some watchlist for utilizing my right of freedom of speech then oh well, because what’s going on here is far bigger than myself. After finishing writing this post I realize just how long it got so apologies for that it means an awful lot to me for you to take the time to read all of this cos I’m at the end of my tether.</p>
<p>For a little context on myself, I’m an 18yo college student from England who’s in the middle of retaking my A Levels, having just started my second year a few weeks ago. My life had just started taking a positive turn last September before the rona “hit” and the world undeniably went to hell. I was living the best 7 months of my life until March as I’m sure many others were. </p>
<p>It almost makes my stomach turn to admit it, but I’ve been locked down at home for exactly 203 days now and believe me, for half this time I’ve wanted anything but. All this time it’s just been me and my mum at home. I had pneumonia when I was around 4yo which has left me with a slight chest weakness that doesn’t effect me all that much whenever I pick up a cold twice a year at most and my mum, due to circumstances outta her control, suffers from a circulatory disorder that causes high blood pressure and the like for her. She’s in her mid 50s and her condition prevents her from working so her life the past few years has been predominantly at home. This is probably why the 1.5 years I’ve been back living with her I’ve not witnessed her fall ill. My last cold was the second week of September and it passed within a few days if that’s relevant to all this.</p>
<p>About a week before the Sinister Six of British Parliament implemented (nay forced!) the lockdown measures my mum felt it would be best to shield ourselves before the inevitable announcements so we’d have a chance of saving ourselves in time (I know the naïvety). I agreed and at the time felt this was the sensible notion to follow through on since neither of us trusted the government (still don’t) and we had no idea how high risk this virus could actually be (don’t worry I won’t be preaching anymore of the doomer gospel). Like a lotta people we bided our time, waited for the peak to pass and yet none of the predictions came true. 250,000 minimum dead? Not even close. I cannot believe I gave up my right to live back then. Hindsight is what it is I guess.</p>
<p>The evidence was the polar opposite of the MSM’s narrative once summer arrived and still is. The MSM advertised ICU’s in full capacity, unconscious patients connected to ventilators and masked, sometimes hazmat clad strangers digging up new burial grounds for those struck down by Covid and of course how can we forget the spare coffins on full display in rural churches to make out there was no room, that it was such an escalating catastrophe in April. There hasn’t been propaganda this scary since the Nazis. Funny how by the time the peak decreased only 40,000 roughly had “died of the rona”, not even 1/5th of the predicted death rate had been reached. </p>
<p>To any doomers who may stumble onto my post hear me when I say that any and all deaths remotely linked to the rona are tragic and families should not have to go through losing a loved one like that. My hearts go out to them so please don’t infest our community with your comments labelling us heartless psychopaths. Thank you and good day to you😊.</p>
<p>Taking into account however the ONS website’s statistics on rona deaths, the results for those who died without a pre-existing condition for the different age brackets are shockingly low. I’m only able to cite this after viewing Alex Belfield’s youtube video on the matter since after fruitless attempts at wading through the official website I was not able to find the exact results as written proof unfortunately. Strange how concrete evidence is becoming harder to find unless you know where to look or have the inside scoop. But let me tell you 4 deaths of those under 19, 39 deaths of those under 60 and 307 deaths total including those over 60 is science that should have been breaking news weeks ago. Of course the majority know nothing of the sort. Those who have died with a pre-existing condition is another matter that a resolution seems impossible to decipher from. If these are in any way incorrect then please let me know.</p>
<p>The reason I have not picked my life back up from where I left off is because of my mum. I do not mean that as a personal attack on her. She’s a lovely person, I have a wonderful relationship with her, I love her to death and she’s the only family I have. My strongest motivation has been to stop her from picking this up and dying through whatever scenario that would entail if I were to venture outside my front door at all, while she’s been telling me that I should be looking out for my own health just as much when I know deep down I’m no more at risk than all of my friends at college who interestingly have carried on with life since the start of summer and have remained unaffected. All of who are very much alive and have not been hospitalized neither have their families. </p>
<p>I can’t work out what her exact perception is. She has sky news on all day whilst looking into all current affairs of the rona on whatever other news sites she’s sourcing. In one breath she says she doesn’t trust the government and then yesterday anxiously points out that sky have reported 16,000 new positive cases from that day alone. She believes the government are trying to downplay the severity of the rona while it’s obvious project fear is far from disappearing. Despite relaying the evidence I’ve found to her, she simply responds with “oh I don’t know”. Anyone with a different opinion who’s supporting the silent majority online (such as Alex Belfield, Carl Vernon and the like) she believes are just looking to stir up trouble by spouting conspiracy theories and that I’m susceptible to be drawn in by it because I’m young and this is the time when my generation starts to take interest in politics. Despite a death rate of roughly 58,000 since March in a country of 67 million, she firmly believes the virus is deadly. She tells me that I’m not able to stay put and let this sort itself out because I’m hormonal and as life is just starting out for me I’m raring to go and letting it get to my head. Anyone who’s getting on with their lives she’s calling idiots. Over and over she’s told me that I only have two options: either stay safe here until we can all be vaccinated or go back out there and risk dying from this. When I’ve conveyed my shock and disdain at the potential of Boris involving the army in cracking down on measures she said the last few generations have never dealt with a pandemic before and these are the precautions necessary to keep the pandemic under control. A couple days ago she had a district nurse come give her her tri-monthly jab, wore double masks and bleached every surface in the bathroom and hallway once the nurse had left. When our weekly food shop delivery turns up, anything left on the kitchen counters in a container of whatever material to not touch it for a few days and if I do accidentally then I have to go wash my hands immediately. Same goes for doing recycling and rubbish. She hasn’t stated or found any of the “sCiEnCe” once the last seven months merely the basic MSM figures. You get the idea. </p>
<p>I’m afraid to admit that I’m living with a doomer but I think that is the case. I’ve nearly butted heads with her over this quite a few times lately and she’s annoyed by it. I don’t want to lose my relationship with my mum over this but I cannot do any quarantine bullshit any longer it’s affecting me horribly. I have this constant churning anxiety that has not left me for weeks. I’m very much an extrovert and having to consider never seeing my friends again who are extended family to me before they all move on to uni is the worst pill to swallow outta all this. I’ve been cut off from everyone and hardly been in contact with them for months on end I cannot just blindly abide by another six months of this crap. I have no idea what to do and I’m despairing on how to handle it because I can’t sway her. I cite actual science, question the illogical void and have sent her videos to back it up but she seems too dismissive and fixed on her instinct that this virus is deadly and that anyone who walks outside doesn’t know what they’re picking up or who they’re infecting it with. The rumors circulating now of a potential half term holiday lockdown don’t seem to phase her as she’s just said to me if Boris enforces it then there must be a reason for it. I get the impression from her that if I was to go out there I wouldn’t be able to come back home in case she got it off of me. She said as such in no way as a threat, but more alarmingly as a point of fact. To her these are covid times and we need to be patient. She believes the certainty of long covid too. </p>
<p>To try and sum all this up, I’m at the end of my rope. I don’t know where to go from here. I feel like I’m  about to break down but I’m too emotionally numb to be able to. This is no way to live. </p>
<p>There is no threat. Covid exists yes, but it is a strain of cold and flu virus the same as other coronaviruses. Coronaviruses have always been airborne and this is no different. No one is dropping dead in the streets nor are the ICUs and hospitals inundated with the walking dead. They are virtually empty as has been confirmed for months by multiple health care workers and nurses across the world, even on reddit. Millions are being neglected and more are dying from lockdown policies and terminal diseases. It’s incredibly rare for human beings to not possess a pre-existing/underlying condition of some kind, even if it does not present itself for the majority of our lives. There have been a handful of reports that ventilator usage has been overly aggressive and been a cause of death in hospitals. Those who have died in car crashes, suicides and other unrelated causes of death are being listed as covid deaths. The PCR tests, as confirmed by the creator, are in no way meant to identify infectious diseases so any and all positive tests may as well be redundant. CASES ARE NOT THE SAME AS INFECTIONS &amp; DEATHS. r/coronavirusuk posts a daily chart of cases and deaths and the past couple days has listed no fewer than 20 deaths a day which of course is awful but remember outta 67 million in the UK. Covid is only listed as the 24th most common killer and has a 99% survival rate. All of this evidence exists. The majority of medical experts are being shunned and silenced. Free speech is condemned and slowly becoming a criminal offense. The UK police are storming peaceful covid protests yet allowing BLM protests to go unchecked. We are being duped successfully because we’re taught our whole lives to never believe in conspiracies. Well my instinct is screaming at me that we’re in the middle of one right now. We’re witnessing the collapse of society. I do not trust this vaccine even though I am absolutely not an anti-vaxxer and I have no idea how I’m going to eventually address to my mum that I do not wish to take it since our futures are defined by it to her.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what else there is to say really and I’m still a little afraid of what could happen if I post this but really I need advice. I’ve heard many people lose their families over these opposing views and it reflects the true colors of the person so any personal experiences would really help me figure this all out. These subs have been a real comfort to me since May it’s reassuring to know I’m not a crazy conspiracy theorist and that there are at least a few thousand on reddit I can share the sanity with. Keep fighting the good fight I guess :)</p></p>
