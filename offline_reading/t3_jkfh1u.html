    <strong>Just had heart surgery</strong>
    <p><p>On Monday, October 26 I finally had surgery on my heart. I was originally scheduled for May 4th, 2020 but that was a no go. I had the surgery near Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  During my stay at the hospital i was not allowed to remove my mask unless to eat or drink. UNREAL. I had to stay overnight so i slept on my side with my mask pulled off one ear that they couldnt see. I couldnt wait to get out of there quick enough so i could breathe.</p></p>

        <p>That’s insane, I would have just removed it there, what are they going to do, deny you continued treatment and kick you out? Not sure how it works up there but that’s definitely not how it goes in the states. </p>
<p>I had a friend who went into labor and the hospital told her she’d have to wear her mask the entire time until the baby was born, then she could take it off for “connection” with the baby at certain times. She asked what they’d do if she refused to wear one at all and they said nothing-that they can’t deny treatment or refuse to take her as a patient so she just didn’t do it. </p>
<p>I hope you’re feeling better now though and on the road to recovery!</p>

        <p>so they tried to kill you basically?</p>
<p>forcing a mask onto people in general is already forcing harm onto people with a chance of dying, BUT after a heart surgery adding more stress on the cardiovascular system by requiring increased breathing effort to try to  adjust for the restriction from the mask certainly  is an increase in your chance of dying after the operation, depending  on what the operation was.</p>
<p>they are trying to kill and traumatize people.</p>
<p>the same is the case with forcing masks onto pregnant woman during birth. this massively increases the chance of complications and  of course as a result also death.</p>
<p>every doctor and nurse doing this is committing a crime.</p>
<p>following orders is no excuse for doctors and nurses. their first  job is to protect patients and help them. they are doing the opposite by trying to force masks onto people after operations and during birth.</p>
<p>also they actually are telling you to wear the mask while sleeping, am i understanding this correctly? so you get reduced oxygen blood saturation, increased stress on the cardiovascular system and increased blood co2 levels all while being asleep? people are already falling over from masks  and getting unconscious, so if that happens during sleep and the mask stays on good bye to life i guess?</p>
<p>but hey at least it will be counted as another "covid-19 death" i guess.</p>
<p>those soul less monsters being drones and following the pedophile criminals claiming to be politicians. it is horrible.</p>
<p>it is horrible, that they are coercing you to self harm. i hate those monsters!</p>

        <p>Ugh, that's awful. I wish you a speedy recovery. I am struggling with the same restrictions while figuring out where to give birth (though at least they can't make me wait an extra 6 months past when it's scheduled).</p>

        <p>I'm dreading having to call different hospitals to find out both their covid policies for women giving birth. I already needed to call to ask what their VBAC policy is which is nerve wracking enough. It's ridiculous to need to call and ask if family is allowed in the room or if there's a mask requirement. Hospitals forcing rules like this don't care about their patients' safety. On the bright side I guess checking for these things will probably help us avoid the dangerous hospitals.</p>

        <p>The biggest questions for me were "are covid tests mandatory" and "will you take my child away if I test positive" because both of those things have happened in my state. Ask those, if you haven't. </p>
<p>Fortunately the answer was "no" to both at my local hospital, but I still don't see how I can labor in a mask. I'm also dragging my feet at calling around for alternatives, though I have heard that birth centers might be less restrictive. Good luck!</p>
