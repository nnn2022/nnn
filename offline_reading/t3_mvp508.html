    <strong>''After all we couldn't know better than experts..''.I translated this to English. It may have errors. Sorry.</strong>
    <p><p>There was a country;</p>
<p>The nurses went from door to door and explained the benefits of formula, making children smarter, and the harmful effects of breast milk. Mothers cut their milk and bought that formula and fed them to their children.</p>
<p>After all, they could not know better than the "educated" people he sent to the door of the state, with their "ignorant" state.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There was a country;</p>
<p>Cows ate fine clovers in their villages, cows gave healthy milk. People stopped drinking it. They mixed the benevolent milk powder with water and gave it to the children in their school desks.</p>
<p>After all, their teachers were giving it, they wouldn't know better than him.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There was a country;</p>
<p>They said ''Butter, eggs, offal bad for cholesterol, don't eat it, you die! ''People scared.  Instead, margarine containing gelatin and which even bacteria do not reproduce were on the tables. Then they said, "Oh sorry, that information is wrong, eat."</p>
<p>The poor people could not know better than the professors.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There was a country;</p>
<p>One day bird flu came to this country.</p>
<p>Media spread panic!</p>
<p>Wise men dressed like white astronauts stuffed the chickens into the sack and destroyed them. The people were afraid. People destroyed the local breed chickens, went to the advertised virus-free branded chicken, took the eggs with white yolks, and ate them with pleasure. After all, the huge journalist had recommended it, in his advertisement and he had given him a tour of its factory.</p>
<p>The public did not know better than a journalist.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There was a country;</p>
<p>The mountains were full of beautiful olive trees, but when olive oil is burned, it becomes carcinogenic.</p>
<p>Watching the advertisements telling about the benefits of sunflower oil, how it lightens it when it eats and blows it up, people threw the olive oil which they produced and bought the oil-like product. Olive trees were cut and a field was made. After all, TV commercials knew better than him.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There was a country;</p>
<p>They said, "there is swine flu." First of all, doctors and healthcare workers stretched their arms to the syringe. Well, of course, the public also panicked. They lamented "Are there no vaccines for us?" And rebelled, "When will it be our turn?" Years later, they said, "Sorry, this was not an epidemic, we came to the game of the vaccine cartels",</p>
<p>Years later,  said, "Sorry, this is not actually an epidemic, we have come to the game of the vaccine cartels", the side effects of the vaccine were covered up. Everything is forgotten.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There was a country;</p>
<p>They talked about the risks of normal birth. ‚ÄúLet's make you an appointment, don't forget your suitcase, crown, lipstick, and slippers with tulle. Come, it will not take 15 minutes, we will give you the most comfortable birth " they said. They did not say that second birth would be risky.</p>
<p>The women rushed .. They could not know better than the doctor.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>NOW IN THAT COUNTRY;</p>
<p>There is a virus again. He came to visit here after the whole Earth.</p>
<p>The people who are controlled by the media are on the head of TV in the past, one professor says "put on the mask" one day. The other one says 'take it out'' another day. They say "everybody goes into the house," and another day "everybody goes out"...</p>
<p>Like a parrot, professors come out and says mask-distance-hygiene.  Folks are listening with their mouths open.</p>
<p>Someone does not go out and tell "how to strengthen the immune system".</p>
<p>It is as if death, the disease came to earth for the first time. All diseases such as cancer, heart failure, flu have been erased because of it. If there is the same thing on every channel. The nation has turned into a walking zombie. Well, they will not know better than MEDIA.</p></p>
