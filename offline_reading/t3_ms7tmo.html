    <strong>I wonder...</strong>
    <p><p>...If deaths by suicide in those who tested positive/were suffering from infection at the time of death were grouped in as COVID deaths, rather than actual suicide? Just a thought.</p></p>

        <p>It could be, especially if you consider that people who make attempts often are not immediately successful and could aquire Covid while being treated then die</p>

        <p>I know two healthy males in their 20s who committed suicide last year after being tested positive for COVID-19. One OD'd as he was convinced that he was going to die a slow painful death. </p>
<p>The other had nowhere to stay other than at home with his wife and child. He was afraid that one or both would die from COVID-19 if he went home, so he hung himself. </p>
<p>Both suicides were recorded as COVID-19 deaths. It's safe to say that the same thing has happened with multiple other suicides.</p>
