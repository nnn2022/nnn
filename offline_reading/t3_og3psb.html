    <strong>A losing battle. Thoughts.</strong>
    <p><p>There appears to be a fight between the general population and those in positions of power to force an agenda. The main issue I see on subverting the primary action against us is that there is not one single figure head you can point to as a means of countering. What I mean is during WW2 and prior we knew the jews were being targetted and Hitler was the face of the evil front and so we had a visual enemy but in this case there is not one single entity to target.</p>
<p>Each country has been infiltrated to push their goal. It is illogical to think there can be mass protests across the world at a single time, it is losing game. Generally the only way to thwart efforts would be a global unification which would be war.</p>
<p>Fear overrules logic and logic dictates reason.</p>
<p>Social divides create an us vs them mentality which once again serves no purpose at betterment. We know the survival rates. Example : the UK has a population five times smaller then the U.S and yet conducts six times the amount of testing. These tests are what the population base the height of the problem on, it doesn't matter that as of several days ago there were just six children in hospital out of 66m people because the appearance of a high case number gives the illusion of chaos and chaos creates fear.</p>
<p>The NHS is being attacked.
Trade is being attacked.
Markets are being attacked.</p>
<p>We have not even accounted for the governments nepotism in contracts or the fact Boris strips an investigating party against him of any powers to prosecuted.</p>
<p>People are crops and crops create profits.</p>
<p>This is a losing battle currently and the only way to resolve it is to hold each person in a position of power accountable this includes pharma, NHS, government and wider. There is not one singular person to point to for this problem, its a deep corrupt system where even Joe Blogs lines his pockets and looks the other way. </p>
<p>The weaponised Intel agencies are in overdrive.</p>
<p>Let us hope for a better tomorrow.</p></p>
