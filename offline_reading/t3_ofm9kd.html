        <p>Same old racket.</p>
<p>“It was thus <strong>easy for the Rockefeller crowd to "induce" the Associated Press Science Editor to adopt a policy which will not permit any story to clear that is not approved by the Drug Trust censor,</strong> and the Drug Trust censor is not going to approve any article that can in any way hurt the sale of drugs.</p>
<p>The Journal of the American Medical Association on January 20, 1940, <strong>bragged</strong> that the United Press had been induced to issue a directive requiring all articles on cures and human health to "clear" through its New York Bureau and <strong>so-called science editor</strong>. The most ironical feature of this program is that <strong>these so-called "science editors" accept Morris Fishbein, dictator of the American Medical Association as an "expert" on medical matters.</strong></p>
<p>The record shows that Mr. <strong>Fishbein never practiced medicine a day in his life,</strong> did not complete the internship part of his medical course, and <strong>could only make 48 in anatomy when he tried to pass the state board medical examination.”</strong></p>
<p>“While each separate trust <strong>under Rockefeller control</strong> enjoys the best in press agentry, <strong>the propaganda of the Drug Trust stands out above all the others for sheer bunkment of the American public.</strong> Newspapers are fed with reams of propaganda about drugs and their "value," in spite of statements by honest and courageous medical men that few of the 12,000 pharmaceutical items made are of any value and most of them are downright harmful.</p>
<p><strong>The truth about cures without drugs is carefully suppressed, unless it suits the purpose of the censor to garble it or just tell part of the truth.</strong> It matters not whether these cures are effected by Chiropractors, Naturopaths, Osteopaths, Christian Science Practitioners or Medical Doctors who use the brains God gave them. You never read about it.” ^1</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Emanuel Josephson writes:</strong></p>
<h2>”THE SUPPRESSION OF RESEARCH AND DISCOVERY</h2>
<p>Now, research committees, which are generally dominated by the A. M.A. and the social service rackets, are <strong>extremely effective devices for the suppression or theft of ideas and discoveries. They usurp and monopolize research funds from all. sources, research facilities, laboratories, hospitals, clinics, and publication media.</strong> They also <strong>engineer censorship of the press</strong> in their respective fields, force their acceptance as ultimate authorities, set themselves up as <strong>dictators of “accepted practice”</strong> which has the cogent force of legal status, and advertise and publicize themselves and their practices.</p>
<p>They are the Grand Inquisitors of Medical Science. <strong>They are in excellent position to protect their commercial interests and to destroy “interloping” medical discoverers who might arise to offer challenge to their assumed omniscience and authority.</strong> The members of the committees generally earn large incomes by doing the scientific chores of allied commercial interests.</p>
<p>The committees are ideally adapted to <strong>protect the established medico-political order and to bar any threat of upset by independent medical discoverers.</strong> By virtue of their position as “authorities,” the public and the press accept their verdicts. <strong>They can affirm or discredit any new discoveries;</strong> and from their verdict there is no recourse. They may <strong>suppress the announcement of discoveries and subsequently steal them and publish them in the name of the committee or of its members.</strong> A case of this type already has been cited. <strong>Few physicians would dare challenge such thefts</strong>, even though they might be subject to proof. This is the significance of <strong>Dr. MacCallum's statement on the subject that is quoted by Dr. Heiser:</strong></p>
<p>”He said that it had struck him while going through medical literature how sad it was that <strong>one never heard of the people who did the real work</strong> (of research and discovery) on many diseases.”</p>
<p>This has been brought about deliberately by medical merchants and their organizations.</p>
<p>Little hesitancy is shown by these groups, often, in the <strong>use of the foulest tactics for destroying discoverers and discoveries which threaten injury to their interests or purses.</strong> Libel and slander are systematically used in these campaigns of vilification. They are <strong>waged by word of mouth, by telephone, by radio, in interviews, and by syndicated columns</strong> — in the medical, scientific, and lay press.</p>
<p>Examples of such committees are as numerous as are the special phases of medicine. The American Otologic Society, for instance, monopolizes the funds and facilities for research in deafness. The <strong>millions of dollars which it has collected from the public have been frittered away in building up a political machine</strong> in the specialty, in drawing up a worthless and politically censored bibliography of deafness and in commercial exploitation of deafness. But nothing has been done for the relief of the deaf.”

        <p>This is what I have been saying all along.  Who the heck are these "fact checkers"?  What are their qualifications?  If they aren't expert themselves in the field they are  "fact checking", they are no more qualified than the rest of us.  They should STFU and allow us unfettered access to information so that we may formulate our own opinions.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But no, they need us to formulate opinions that they deem acceptable.  That's what its all about.  Not drawing conclusions, but drawing conclusions that they want.</p>

        <p>I avoid clicking on any Reuters article and thus giving them the views.</p>
<p>It's a 'news' organization with an agenda as every single thing they fact check comes back as, surprise surprise, "Go vaccines! they're completely safe". Not surprising when the Thompson Reuters Foundation chair is on the Pfizer board.</p>
<p>https://www.pfizer.com/people/leadership/board-of-directors/james_smith</p>
<p>Wouldn't trust anything they publish as they are not remotely impartial. Particularly as they have been receiving funding from the UK government for decades as well.</p>
<p>My philosophy has been, if it's a Reuters article, to click on the link below it in an effort to shove Reuters further down search results. Clicking on the junk they publish just helps them.</p>
