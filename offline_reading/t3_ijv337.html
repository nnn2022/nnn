        <p>Isn’t the R0 less than 1 already in some places? April of 2021 seems arbitrary and probably unrealistically pessimistic-at least for the social end. Plus he would have to account for other countries at VERY different stages of the pandemic. He does seem reasonable on some other things.</p>

        <p>stop the worthless flawed testing and u stop the fakedemic.</p>
<p>it is literally that easy.</p>
<p>all it needs is people awaken to the scam and step away from it.</p>
<p>looking over a few tweets from this doctor, it seems clear, that he either is a shill for the fascism agenda removing all freedoms, removing cash, etc... or he is just a mislead doctor, who still puts trust into the corrupt false authorities like the WHO, CDC, etc...</p>
<p>either way his statements like:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FaheemYounus/status/1300397535664668672">https://twitter.com/FaheemYounus/status/1300397535664668672</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Wearing a mask, washing hands and maintaining 6-ft distance will. It’s even more important in indoor spaces (trains).  </p>
<p>shows, that he isn't reading the studies himself.</p>
<p>otherwise he would know that masks don't work at all:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/?report=classic</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Face Masks<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In our systematic review, we identified 10 RCTs that reported estimates of the effectiveness of face masks in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections in the community from literature published during 1946–July 27, 2018. In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; <em>I</em>2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7181938/figure/F2/">Figure 2</a>).</p>
<p>and of course there is no science backing up the 6 feet distancing either, it does however help facial recognition  and does harm people as social isolation is harmful to people.</p>
<p>(self isolation of actually sick people has been common for a very very long time and u can't compare that to senseless 6 feet distance between healthy people)</p>
<p>he also doesn't understand, that the PCR tests are worthless garbage, that will even test fruit and goats positive:</p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/">https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/</a> </p>
<p>and he also doesn't understand it seems, that the death numbers are made up:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1247669966939262977?s=09">https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1247669966939262977?s=09</a>  (tweet from usa government saying, that they are counting everyone with a positive test who dies as a covid-19 death)</p>
<p>and that is actually how it goes in practice:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/florida-man-20s-who-died-motorcycle-wreck-labeled-covid-19-death-state">https://www.zerohedge.com/political/florida-man-20s-who-died-motorcycle-wreck-labeled-covid-19-death-state</a> </p>
<p>in the article u find an interview with dr. scott jensen breaking the insane CDC guidelines down, that exist to create tons of fake "covid-19 deaths"</p>
<p>so again, either this doctor is just a misinformed person, who thinks, that he is doing something good and thinks, that he is sharing truth, or he is deliberately pushing the agenda of fear and the almost endless pandemic.</p>
<p>either way, it is certainly great food for the media, as they always look for the latest person to push "appeal to authority" a little harder, especially as some of the others might no longer work very well like paul offit, or peter hotez:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3EHrjfLXaw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3EHrjfLXaw</a> </p>
<p>how do we stop this fakedemic? again simple, we need to wake up and stop using worthless tests and believe fake death numbers.</p>
<p>and a big enough amount of us needs to wake up and we are certainly getting there as we can see from berlin, london etc... at the demonstrations on the 29.august 2020.</p>
<p>but that is how it ends, the criminal government WON'T stop, they are all in, they want the digital dystopia in place, so that prison is so tight in 2025, that u can't do anything anymore.</p>
<p>if u are reading this, remember that it is YOU! who has to stop this, or it won't be over and will only get worse.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you said except:
&rt; it is literally that easy</p>
<p>Obviously it isn't or we'd already be back to old-normal. Hundreds of thousands if not millions have been protesting all around the world. Growing numbers of people are aware of what's going on. Yet it's still happening nonetheless.</p>
<p>So this will end when we actually hold people to account and succeed in bringing perpetrators to justice for these crimes against humanity. There's nothing easy about that though.</p>

        <p>well yes, that will certainly be necessary, but most of the insane measures  can be flipped off like a switch through mass non compliance coming from awareness.</p>
<p>if 50% or 20% of all of the public just stepped away from the bullshit and never wore a slave mask again and NEVER wore one in their jobs or as company owners tried to enforce it and removed all the bullshit, and accepted cash, etc... then all this would go  bye bye over night.</p>
<p>the criminal government wouldn't have enough slave idiots in military gear called "police" or straight up military to even try to begin enforcing their bs garbage.</p>
<p>i would say, that we aren't there yet, but we certainly are going there fast 29.august 2020 was another huge success and gives people strength to see, that they are not alone.</p>
<p>in serbia the criminal government has to scrap their plans for a curfew, after the  people didn't take it and the criminal government turned around:<br>
<a href="https://www.corbettreport.com/interview-1564-new-world-next-week-with-james-evan-pilato/">https://www.corbettreport.com/interview-1564-new-world-next-week-with-james-evan-pilato/</a> (2nd story of the video)</p>
<p>just article to it from crappy bbc:  <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53353854">https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-53353854</a> </p>
<p>of course the serbians need to hold the criminal government, who dared to think about removing their freedoms accountable as the traitors, that they are, but this just shows, that when the public actually stands together, that the government can't do anything.</p>
<p>yes we need to remove the criminals and pedophiles in government and likely change things around like implement required plebiscites on stuff, after enough signatures have been gathered. and binding plebiscites on stuff without changes!</p>
<p>(one of the suggestions for germany)</p>
<p>yes we need to fight back and remove all the 5g, as it is the backbone for the spying system, remove smart meter, as they are another part of the spying on the public.</p>
<p>fight the removal of cash at all costs, etc... etc..</p>
<p>and all of this requires great strategy and all of this also requires an aware and awake public, but an aware and awake public already will straight up make tons of the criminal freedom removing measures impossible.</p>

        <p>I don't disagree with you at all.</p>
<p>It just definitely won't be quick or easy is all I'm saying. This is more or less a world war against the common man, with the compounding effects of literally generations of indoctrination underpinning it, to say nothing of the ever-increasing technological sophistication enabling propaganda to an extent that would have been unimaginable just a few short years ago.</p>
<p>Despite the seemingly insurmountable challenges, I really don't think all hope is lost, because even with the absolutely gargantuan coordinated efforts to gaslight the public and control the narrative, millions of people are waking up and protesting all around the world.</p>
<p>I am personally doing anything and everything that I can. I have never and will never wear a mask. i will never accept a mandatory vaccination. I write my local representatives. I share and discuss these topics wherever anyone will listen. I'm building a video archive on alternative platforms (search my username on LBRY, Bitchute, 3speak) to resist censorship. I have a lot of other ideas for efforts to put forward which I will have more time to focus on as I've been laid off. That still all adds up to very little, but every bit counts. Everyone counts.</p>
<p>Not easy - but is necessary. There is no alternative but to do whatever it takes. Accepting some nightmarish global totalitarian dystopia is not an option.</p>

        <p>it is a hard battle to wake the public up.</p>
<p>the stepping away could be easy, but because of the sleeping public pulling is down, it is hard and tons of work.</p>
<p>stopping the testing would be easy, when the public just wouldn't accept them anymore and wush the fakedemic would be over.</p>
<p>getting to that aware public is the battle of our lifetime.</p>
<p>i could have been more clear about it i guess, but it hurts to see an easy solution, and we are held collectively by chains of generation long precisely tuned propaganda :/</p>
<p>seeing all the huge protests and networking, that comes with them gave me quite some hope though :)</p>
<p>&rt; I have never and will never wear a mask. i will never accept a mandatory vaccination. </p>
<p>same here my friend. i rather die, than wear a slave muzzle and might as well draw a line  there, because they will certainly push it further anyways, or rather try to, if we let them :D</p>
<p>&rt; I'm building a video archive on alternative platforms (search my username on LBRY, Bitchute, 3speak) to resist censorship. </p>
<p>woob woob :)</p>
<p>i think it was the bot from this subreddit, maybe another, that said, that all bitchute links will auto shadowban any comment :D shows how afraid they are of mostly censorship free platforms.</p>
<p>&rt; Not easy - but is necessary. There is no alternative but to do whatever it takes. Accepting some nightmarish global totalitarian dystopia is not an option. </p>
<p>yes, also sounds great what u're doing.  ٩(⁎❛ᴗ❛⁎)۶</p>
