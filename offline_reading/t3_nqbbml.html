        <p>From what I am seeing, their argument is that at the time all of the data proved that masks didn't work. Then, when he did a 180 last year, it was because a study (which has never been made public) emerged proving that the previous 100+ years worth of knowledge about face masks was wrong. </p>
<p>Nobody can produce this study, so it's either a top secret document or it doesn't exist.</p>

        <p>1st one: data is inconclusive and needs a larger study. non-inferiority of mask vs. no mask needs more data.</p>
<p>2nd one: is about masks in a surgery environment with yet unclear results.</p>
<p>3rd one: is a non-inferiority trial which states that n95 masks are at least as good as surgical masks in the measured categories</p>
<p>4th one: states what should be obvious: contamination on the outside of the mask can lead to contamination of the mask wearer if not handleed properly. </p>
<p>none of the 4 studies confirm the statement: "fauci changed his mind on masks, because heprofits of masks made in china"</p>

        <p>The Wuhan lab is one among many others that recieves funding from all over the place just as much as other labs recieve funding from all over the place. that's how international research works. </p>
<p>How exactly has Fauci lied? Did he make a statement at some point and made a different statement with more research and information and thus corrected his stance on something later? because that is not how "lying" works.</p>

        <p>Still not answering the question. By CCP, I mean any CCP associated program. That the CCP ultimately will control or can control. Because, ya know, they can control anything within the country that they want.</p>

        <p>He’s lied many times, watch him squirm when rand Paul questions him. Also the virus particles are much smaller then perforations in most masks. You need to accept you’ve been had, the foundations these last 15 months of tyranny are built on are all lies/misdirection. It couldn’t be more clear with each passing day.

        <p>the size of the virus is insignificant as a measurement, because the virus can not traverse from host to host on its own. it needs a transport medium like aerosols or droplets...and droplets definitely exceed the size of the mesh-size in mosts masks. The aerosols are a different matter, of course.</p>
<p>What I am accepting is that all your "The pandemic is a means to keep us controled forever" screams are getting more and more quiet by the day, as more and more countries see significant drops in cases thanks to the vaccines and are lifting measures left and right. There is an end to the pandemic in sight and you know it. </p>
<p>Your problem is that you don't ask your own oh-so-trusted sources the same critical questions you are asking the "corporate media". Like for example who profits from you believing conspiracy theories etc. There is always someone that makes a nice buck of the easily manipulated. Just think of the ongoing grift of your ex-president making massive amounts of money from is cult status and the boost the qanon idiots give his popularity.</p>

        <p>Here's exactly what he said.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you’re in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it’s not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences — people keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.</p>

        <p>If masks made your life so unbearable that just seems more like you’re being triggered by really small stuff. I’m fishy about this whole virus and where it came from and the vaccine as a whole which is why I haven’t taken it but mask mandates were not some kind of unbearable thing that made life so much worse. People really are freaking out about them way too much, myself being guilty of this in the beginning.</p>
<p>The masks don’t prevent you from getting the virus but they say there’s a chance of them of preventing you of spreading it directly which meant it was good to wear them whenever you were inside a public area because people could have been infected and not actually felt sick for a few hours or a day. </p>
<p>Even if only 10 less people got infected because of masks then that’s worth it for doing something as simple as wearing a mask for a few mins out of the day. Cheers!</p>

        <p>Did you not read my comment? I said what if you’re sick and you don’t realize it for a day? If you wear a mask there’s a chance you don’t spread it to the same amount of people you would have if you hadn’t worn a mask. There’s also a chance it does nothing, but it’s not like people are asking you to wear a full hazmat suit and only leave your house 2 days a week or to cover the medical expenses of someone else. All that’s being asked is to wear a mask for the 10 mins you go into store and once you leave you’re free to do whatever you please.</p>

        <p>I did read your comment. Getting sick is just a part of life, just like death and taxes. Deal with it. You fail to realize that none of us can predict when we’ll get sick. By your logic, we should wear masks whenever we’re in a store or public place “just in case.”</p>
<p>Wearing a mask isn’t some minor inconvenience like you make it out to be. It’s a major disruption to normal life. And since I’m not responsible for the health of others, I <strong>will not</strong> wear a mask.</p>

        <p>By my logic I would say wearing the masks during a pandemic makes sense. </p>
<p>By your logic of getting sick is a natural part of life like death and uh taxes? Don’t know why we taxes are being brought up, you could have just said death. Anyway back to what I was saying by your logic we shouldn’t do anything in life to try to prevent any death because it’s just a natural part of life. You do know how stupid that sounds right? </p>
<p>Masks are not a major disruption to life whatsoever. It’s a piece of cloth over your mouth and nose that doesn’t prevent you from going about life in major ways in anyway shape or form. For you to think that is quite idiotic and just lends more credence to you not knowing what you’re taking about at all.</p>

        <p>The mask is not going to impede your breathing unless you’re doing heavy lifting or cardio where your breathing elevates and even then I’m still open to see how much it even affects a person negatively. It’s not negatively affected me too much while working out even though I would prefer not having one on at all. </p>
<p>I just do not see how any piece of cloth over someone’s face could negatively impede your life so much.</p>

        <p>Here's a news flash for your ignorant self then: People are all different, and something that doesn't bother one person at all, or negatively impede their life or health, can be a very bad thing to others. I, for one, have breathing issues that do cause prolonged mask wearing to be problematic, and have had a few situations where it led to some bad situations for me health-wise. So, best to just speak for yourself, and make decisions for yourself, and leave others to decide what's best for themselves and their own health, ok?</p>

        <p>I’m not focusing on those people when I bring up mask wearing. The majority of people against mask wearing are not like you. The majority just think it’s some kind of government oppression and tyranny. Those are the people who I’m focusing my comments towards. Maybe I should have specified people in your situation in my previous comment but I like I said before I was not focusing my comments towards people in your situation because obviously you shouldn’t be required to wear a mask.</p>
<p>I’m all for people taking health decisions into their own hands. It’s why I haven’t received the vaccine and don’t intend on getting it any time soon.</p>

<p>Source on that?  I'm not in that camp myself, but I hate wearing a mask as much as anyone; it's dehumanizing, it's embarrassing, it's restricting, it's uncomfortable.  </p>
<p>If you find that wearing one doesn't "negatively impede your life so much" then keep doing so.  But if you want to be consistent with your point of view then it seems to me that you will wear a mask for the rest of your life.  You <em>might</em> infect someone, and it's no big deal to wear a mask.  Many of us don't find that sort of life attractive at all.</p>

        <p>I will not be wearing one for the rest of my life. I will wear one at times like these though if I feel like it’s the best option. For example when a new type of virus emerges that isn’t just a variants of more common viruses like the flu.</p>
<p>I can’t say I have a specific source, just from how I see people respond to them at times with people saying mask mandates were unconstitutional and government overreach. It felt like too many people just wanted to not wear one for the sake of not wearing one and being told what to do. I also don’t see how the masks can be dehumanizing and embarrassing and so I guess I lump those people in with the government oppression people as it just feels like a bad reason to give as to why you don’t want to wear a mask.</p>

<p>How are you going to define "times like these"?  Think about that for a minute.  Who is it that is defining "times like these"?</p>
<p>&rt;I also don’t see how the masks can be dehumanizing and embarrassing</p>
<p>That's cool and all, people are different.  I like to talk to people while I stand in line, that sort of thing, always have.  That is by the wayside over the last 14/15 months.  You probably don't, and if I tried to start a conversation with while standing in line, and it seemed like you weren't into it, I would immediately stop.  It's not your thing, just like wearing a mask is not my thing.</p>
<p>And I hate to be pedantic, but "mask mandates were unconstitutional" is something I agree with.  I could be out of my realm with that one, but I do think a case could be made.</p>

        <p>What I mean by times likes these is just any type of pandemic like time we have right now. Now we could argue whether or not this really is a pandemic level virus or not because even I have my suspicions about that but if for example something similar to the flu came around one year but was like 1.5x or 2.0x more contagious and deadlier then that would be a time I would mask up again. If it’s just the common flu going around like all the other years then I would just go business as usual like all the past years.</p>
<p>I understand what you’re saying. Our face is crucial for communicating and so I could see why masks could be more annoying for someone like you who likes to chat with people a lot. </p>
<p>As with the mask mandates being unconstitutional, I’m also curious if there could be a case there but I don’t see it like that because it’s not something that’s going to put most peoples health as risk in anyway or really restrict any freedoms.</p>

        <p>That wasn’t my intention but I do feel they are similar which is why Im not freaked out by Covid really. Maybe the constant media attention on it has made me feel like it’s more dangerous than it actually is which I’m assuming was their goal.</p>
<p>What I mean is that if there are any virus outbreaks in the future that are more dangerous than normal ones we deal with annually then I would consider wearing a mask during those times but I wouldn’t know exactly until a time like that comes around.</p>

        <p>Once again that is also true. I know they could be for people who have breathing problems. What I meant by that was they don’t physically impede most people from doing most things. Like your life is not going to be put on halt because they want you to wear a mask in stores, on flights or on public transit. It could be an inconvenience to people but they won’t disrupt day to day life for the majority of people.</p>

        <p>I'm getting what you're saying.  I think where we diverge is as to why we are doing this.  For me, if the virus was attacking children indiscriminately, for example, and killing more than it is, I would be more willing to be 'inconvenienced' as you say.  But that's not the case.  It's killing elderly and sick people for the most part, and a small percentage of those.  The way I look at it, mental health is very important too, and mask wearing sacrifices that; it scares people, makes people afraid of one another.</p>

        <p>Word I get what you’re saying. I think a big problem is what media has done to people. Media was just all fear mongering the entire time and did nothing to help alleviate any concerns people might have had except just saying “listen to us or people are gonna die” basically. </p>
<p>I appreciate your discourse as well. Most people didn’t seem to want to chat as you can see from my downvotes but oh well. Thanks for the chat and new points of view. Believe it or not I used to be adamantly against masks and thought they were pointless but at this point I’m like “whatever, doesn’t bother me much” even though I would prefer to not have them and get back to being able to walk around a mall with a drink in hand and not have to pull my mask down whenever I was to take a sip. Also I’m the gym because they can be quite annoying at times if the mask is not a good one and breathing can get uncomfortable. </p>

<p>No it's not.  Children are being forced to wear masks all day long.  Adults are being forced to wear masks when flying commercially.  Workers are being forced to wear masks for entire shifts.

        <p>I think it’s psychological abuse having to wear something that covers your facial expression and not getting to see other people’s faces. Even if a mask helps 5%, it comes at a cost. I get it, if I had to wear a mask to visit a nursing home I wouldn’t be complaining. Even the grocery store I kinda get since people need to go and it’s a chore anyway. But being made to wear one everywhere outside of my house? That’s abusive. Some people have to wear one 8 hours a day. I think the main reason they exist is to remind people of Covid and to scare them, otherwise most people would have forgotten about it and moved on with their lives. They also create the impression everyone supports lockdown, which is terrifying, when in reality it’s 50/50. It’s an insidious form of political propoganda.</p>

        <p>I think calling it psychological abuse is a little much. I agree that masks were probably pushed too much especially because there was no reason for someone to be wearing one outside while going for a run for example.</p>
<p>I don’t know if I would say they are part of insidious propaganda or to remind people of Covid because if that was the case I don’t see why they would be letting up on pretty much every restriction as of recently. I would think they would try to keep it going as long as possible. I do appreciate though that you see uses in them when it comes to nursing homes and grocery stores. I would say we agree there because I ,once again, don’t see the point in wearing them when you’re outside and only passing people here and there for half a second. </p>
<p>I appreciate your take on it. Cheers!</p>

        <p>It's not that I find them to be particularly "inconvenient". I simply don't care for the notion that "everyone else's health/safety/peace of mind/et cetera" is "my responsibility". It's not, full stop. And secondly, I really just don't like being told what to do or how to act.  </p>
<p>The more the government, corporations, celebrities, and the media try to push shit like this, the more suspicious it becomes to me, and the less likely I am to be cooperative. Especially when there are zero actual signs of a "serious pandemic" in my daily life. Nobody dropping dead in the streets. No bodies piled up in the hospitals. No mass graves. People still lining up in big box stores, supermarkets, coffee shops, fast food restaurants all around.  </p>
<p>And then there's the numbers themselves. 540 total deaths "with COVID" in my province, in the span of, what, going on a year and a half now? That's out of a population of 1.2 million. A whopping 0.04%. And fucking 99% of them within the average life expectancy range. How is that even remotely surprising to anyone? Yeah, I never would have expected an 85-year-old with heart disease to up and die. So young, so sudden. Incidentally, the global rate is also 0.04% - 3.4 million out of 8 billion. And that's "with COVID + comorbidities". "With COVID alone" plummets down to 175,000 total, which is 0.002%.  </p>
<p>And before you start whining to me about S<em>eatbelts™</em> and <em>Speed Limits™</em> and <em>Drunk Driving™</em>, be forewarned that I do not care. For starters, wearing a seatbelt, not speeding, and not driving drunk are acts of self-preservation first and foremost. Masking, as advertised, is <em>entirely</em> for the "sake of others".  </p>
<p>Allow me to stress once more that I do not hold myself accountable for the "safety" of everyone else. I am obliged to look out for myself and my family, and beyond that, whomever I so choose. I am neither actively nor "passively" bringing harm to <em>anyone</em> by merely going about my own business, mask or no mask.  </p>
<p>If so-and-so and their grandma fear for their very lives, they can take it upon themselves to take whatever measures they deem to be appropriate in order to mitigate their own risk. I do not <em>know</em> them, I do not <em>care</em> for them, and I am <em>not</em> responsible for looking after them.</p>

        <p>I mean, I’m wasn’t going to start saying stuff about seatbelts. It seems no one is reading my comments when I say I’m actively against what the government says about this virus and 99% of the stuff they are saying just in general. I simply don’t see any point in getting so up in arms about wearing a mask while in a store or in a indoor public area. I find it odd that this is the hill people are choosing to die on so to speak.</p>
<p>While it is true that you are indeed only responsible for yourself, your family and others you choose to be responsible for because no one can can really be expected to be responsible for everyone in life, I think something as little as wearing a mask for a few minutes out of a day is something that if it could help people then why not do it? It barely affects someone’s life in any substantial way and if it has a chance to help people even if a small amount at no expense to yourself then why not do it. It’s not like you’re being told to pay for people’s medical expenses or go out of your way to help someone else.</p>

        <p>I read your comments and gave my response to your rationale. Did you read mine? I stated plainly that don't find it "inconvenient", per se. Not in a physical sense. My problem is:  </p>
<p>A.) I have nothing but disdain for the notion that I am to somehow be held responsible for the safety of "everyone else".  </p>
<p>B.) I simply do not <em>like</em> being told what to do or how to act by the government, media, corporations, etc. Especially when it's presented in such a sanctimonious way. I find it nauseating.  </p>
<p>So yes, it does come at a personal expense. Simply put: <em>It pisses me the fuck off.</em> What you don't seem to realize is that not everyone shares your particular sensibilities. Good for you if you're happy to be compliant. I'm not. Even at the best of times, I despise government and their constant overreaching, which has gotten demonstrably worse over the past year. For someone like me, yeah, this is absolutely infuriating and frustrating. This entire situation is a FUBAR soup sandwich, and I'm not about to just let any aspect of it slide, and that includes "minor inconveniences" like mandatory mask edicts.</p>

        <p>I say I wonder if anyone read my comment because your first response you assumed I was going to give the seatbelt analogy or the drunk driving analogy like how I assume most people who attacked you for your position probably tried to use against you. </p>
<p>I’m all in agreement with you when it comes to government overreach and how it’s a ever growing problem. I also can agree how annoying it is seeing celebrities trying to shove stuff down our throats acting all high and mighty. Where I disagree is how the personal expense to you that masks are causing are they “piss you the fuck off”. Now maybe that’s something that can be used in this situation, but I ask what about in the future if something serious actually does go down where people have to change how they go about their lives? Would you still be against whatever would need to be done if it “pisses you the fuck off”? </p>
<p>Also do you wear masks where they are required? If so do you get very annoyed or mad that you have to do that? And if that’s the case then aren’t they inconvenient to you since they are causing you to physically react to having to wear them?</p>

        <p>I added that part to simply get ahead of it. I've encountered the <em>seatbelts ad nauseum</em> "argument" dozens of times now, and it's tiresome to go through that rigmarole again and again. That's all there is to it.  </p>
<p>"The future" doesn't exist. Hypotheticals mean sweet fuck all. I plan and prepare for things broadly, as best as I'm able, but at the end of the day, it's all just speculation. Maybe I didn't make it clear, though. The reason this pisses me off, is because I don't consider the virus to be dangerous enough to warrant any of this. The lockdowns, edicts, curfews, everything. Fucking massive overreaction across the board. You're free to disagree. That doesn't change my view on it. Different standards. 540 total "with COVID" deaths over the span of a year-and-a-half in my province of 1.2 million is nowhere near significant in my eyes.  </p>
<p>I've worn masks where required (mostly) since the provincial government made them mandatory. And yes, I do get fucking annoyed whenever I do it. I've already stated that it pisses me the fuck off. Are you acknowledging that masks actually <em>can</em> be an actual physical inconvenience, then? Because you're attacking your own argument if that's the case. Your entire point hinges on the idea that wearing a mask "is of no inconvenience" to anyone.  </p>
<p>The reason I go along with it mainly has to do with the fact that I'd rather not paint a target on my back. The cops here are ticket-happy, pandemic or no pandemic, and they've only gotten worse. I don't need them breathing down my neck and hounding me, and I especially don't need them harassing me at my business and forcing me to shut down over arbitrary bullshit. Furthermore, I have children, including an infant son. I'm not going to get into fucking fights with busybodies and Karens every fucking time I take them anywhere with me. They've been traumatized enough over the duration of this shit show as it is.</p>

        <p>I’m not denying masks can be of inconvenience to anyone. They are an inconvenience to me at times while working out in the gym. My point is I don’t seem that as so much of an inconvenience as for someone to become so enraged by needing to wear one, that’s all.</p>
<p>I agree when you say it’s all be blown out of proportion. Whether masks were needed or not I just don’t see how mask mandates are this some kind of government overreach to an extent that they need to be actively pushed back against and treated like they are such a huge problem. </p>
<p>I understand your point and agree on quite a bit. Also word of advice, don’t jump to conclusions that someone is going to start “whining” about seatbelt analogies and etc. you wanna jump on top of it before it’s said again? Cool but if you were so worried about having to explain your side over and over again then maybe you shouldn’t be responding to comments where you need then have to possibly explain yourself over and over.

        <p>You're still doing it.  </p>
<p>You failed in your objective by repeatedly being dismissive of why I am angry. I explained it in detail numerous times, and you continually circled back to "yeah but I just don't see how it's bad tho". And then you went back to being fucking hung up on my preemptive attack on the tired bullshit arguments that idiots routinely make whenever this issue comes up.  </p>
<p>And, not just against me, but across this entire issue. It's the go-to "counter" whenever someone voices discontent about masks. Getting ahead of it is not "stupid", it's being proactive and squashing a pathetic non-argument before it even has a chance to propagate and derail the discussion. The "open discussion" that you claimed to want.  </p>
<p>I, in spite of my anger, do understand why some people are pro-mask. They <em>think</em>  that they are being helpful. They <em>think</em> they are "protecting others". They <em>think</em> that they are being good citizens. I also understand why some people are ambivalent towards it. They <em>think</em> it's unnecessary, or even "inconvenient", but they go along with it for whatever reason. I understand why some people are simply neutral on the issue as well. These people just do whatever they're asked without complaining because it's the path of least resistance.  </p>
<p>But of course, there are also scores of people who simply do it for the sake of appearances. Fucking virtue signalers. They deserve every bit of my scorn.  </p>
<p>My anger runs deeper than the superficial issue of masks. I stated that it's not even the mask itself. It's general fucking principles. Con-fucking-gratulations to you for being so very satisfied and compliant with it all.  </p>
<p>Maybe I somehow didn't convey this forcefully enough. I <em>truly despise</em> authority, and I always have. Because of this, I keep as much distance as possible from the government and overbearing law enforcement. I don't rock the boat. I do this for the sake of my family, and for my own sanity. But this shit show has thrown the balance that I previously maintained completely off the deep end, into a fucking shit abyss.  </p>
<p>I suppose it's just too much to ask of a fucking normie to be able to comprehend any of this. It's always just going to be "you don't care about others!" or "ya but i just dont get why its such a big deal tho". Telling me I "lack compassion" while simultaneously outright refusing to even consider my side of it in the goddamn slightest.</p>

        <p>You’re inability to control your anger stops you from having an open discussion. You’re not getting “ahead” of anything by doing what you did. You made a handful of assumptions about me before even posting your response which then lead you to “squashing” arguments I had no intention of even making. </p>
<p>I’m no virtue signaler or “normie” whatever that means so maybe you should go and direct your anger towards these people that deserve your scorn so much. </p>
<p>I still don’t know how you can say I’m not considering your side when I agreed with points you made which would mean I had to have considered what you were saying, but when you come out of the gate aggressive and saying how much you despise authority and this and that you just sound like an edgy pre-teen who can’t keep his emotions in check. I don’t know what causes you to have such an issue with authority but don’t expect people to understand where you’re coming from when you act like that.</p>
<p>I wish you the best man, genuinely.</p>

        <p>Maybe it would be easy to talk to the group if there wasn’t a load of hypocrisy bullshit forced down our throats for over a year.</p>
<p>If they did something even “sMaLl” why all the contradictions and why wasn’t that the original narrative? Why were states that removed mask mandates doing better than states with it? The evidence isn’t there - and the “feel good” of wearing a mask is just a security blanket at this point unless you are sick and trying not to spread.</p>

        <p>They most likely do something small. The government contracting themselves constantly does not mean that whatever small benefit masks might bring is automatically thrown out the window. They are all over the place but I don’t think that because of that everything that is said is a complete lie, especially when it comes to masks because whatever their agenda was I don’t know how much masks being worn or not being worn would have affected said agenda.</p>
<p>When it comes cases going down in states without mask mandates, that can be a multitude of factors. Some people brought up the possibility of the density of a population in wherever the masks weren’t being worn could have played an part because millions of people wouldn’t have been populating in close quarters like in NYC for example. </p>
<p>I’m not an advocate for masks or against masks really. I’m more of just at a point where I just say it’s not a big deal to wear one for a few minutes out of a day when In stores for example if the possibility of them doing at least something beneficial is there.</p>
<p>I agree with you about the hypocrisy from the other side. That was ,quite frankly, just a perfect example of the media and government playing favorites and having some kind of agenda.</p>

        <p>I don’t know exact numbers but I think it was somewhere around like 20% for most retail masks and like 90% for the N95’s. That’s not a lot, I know, and it could end up being lower honestly with people reusing masks and not being in completely sanitary environments. I still just don’t see a big problem in wearing them though because I’m only wearing them for like an hour at a time max when I’m in the gym usually. </p>
<p>Maybe they are pointless but I just don’t understand people being adamantly against them because I just don’t seem them as that much of a nuisance.</p>

<p>Well some people have a problem with pointless performative theater to deal with a serious problem. Alot of people have to wear them alot more than you. Demanding that people to do something that everyone knows is damn near useless erodes public trust. Masks are just one of a long line of pointless gestures  (restricting outdoor movements/activities, shutting down bars/restaurants, putting up dumb fucking plexiglass, etc) and restrictions that people like you have welcomed because you don't see it as a big deal. Do you have anything new or useful to say or do you just want to keep repeating your stupid "masks arent a big deal" mantra. We get it. You are a pushover.</p>

        <p>Right. Wrote in early February, long before any recorded community transmission in the US ("The first U.S. cases of nontravel–related COVID-19 were confirmed on February 26 and 28"). Up until then asymptomatic and presymptomatic weren't really proven. (Suspected yes, isolated evidence for, yes). Unless Sylvia was traveling to China or Italy, pretty sound advice -- for the time.</p>
<p>The whole point of masks to reduce the spread by the asymptomatic and presymptomatic. <br>
Remember, this pandemic occurred precisely because at the time Fauci wrote this, asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread and aersolized spread were not thought to be properties of this virus.</p>
<p>I used to think it was a lot like driving a seat-belt, but its more like using your headlights on at dusk. You can see just fine, but others can't see you so well. By using them, you greatly reduce an accident / transmission event.  If there are no other cars on the road, it won't make a difference, but the more cars, the greater the chance of an accident. </p>
<p>It's the same with masks and prevalence. If there is 0 transmission in your community, there's no need for masks.  Due to uncertainties of how much viral shedding occurs, how long it stays in the air (indoors), how many days until recorded cases, mobility, etc,  the benefit rapidly rises with even a few cases.</p>

        <p>SARS CoV 2 is definitely different. it is a new pathogen that needed to be understood first. In the beginning it was assumed to be a lung disease, by now we know its a vascular disease. In the beginning we thought it would only spread via droplets as carriers, now we know its also aerosols etc. </p>
<p>Virology is not an exact science. never has been. but that flu season was pretty much canceld, while Covid still ravaged should tell you something about the effectiveness of the measures against infectious diseases that we know. I say should, because you won't because for you it is just "evidence" that "the flu and covid are the same thing" or some other bullshit you keep telling yourself.</p>

        <p>and how exactly is "the flights were shut down" not one of the measures I was talking about. Let me repeat it for you: "Flu season was effectively canceled [...] should tell you something about the effectiveness of the measures[...]"</p>
<p>And about the size of the virus I said somewhere else already: The size of the virus is inconsequential when it comes to the mesh size of masks, because a virus needs a medium of travel, like droplets or aerosols and the masks are very good at keeping droplets with the viral load from going through. Masks are to protect others from your droplets, how often does that need to be repeated? That they don't help effectively against aerosols is a given, this we can agree on. But the aerosol problem is mostly helped by social distance and e.g. meeting outside. <br>
And yes, Sars CoV 2 is a coronavirus and some types of cold are created by endemic coronaviruses, too. But just as much as there are more and less deadly/infectious variations of the flu (Hell, the last big pandemic we had that shut down whole countries was the spanish flu), there are more and less deadly/infectious versions of the Coronavirus type (MERS, SARS, SARS-CoV2) you cant draw comparisons between them.</p>

        <p>Ok. I’m gonna explain this one last time for you guys. I’m gonna get downvoted to hell by the circle jerk but fuck it I have karma to spare. </p>
<p>The reason why the doctors didn’t think masks worked at first for I infected people is because they thought that people would be able to detect symptoms as soon as they could spread the virus, which would let them know they probably needed a mask.</p>
<p>Then, further research revealed that asymptomatic cases were a prominent issue. People didn’t know that they were spreading the disease, because they had no symptoms, and didn’t think they needed to wear a mask until it was too late. </p>
<p>This meant that healthy people needed to wear masks so that they couldn’t spread the disease while asymptomatic; because unless they were going in for tests every day they wouldn’t know if they had it.</p>
<p>You may be asking; “why is it that cases were still going up if people were wearing masks?”
Well, I’ll be perfectly honest and say that masks are not an end all be all solution to spreading disease. It helps at making it so infected people can’t sneeze or cough on anything or anyone, this is true, but infected air is an issue regardless of whether you’re wearing a mask or not. Same principle goes for infected surfaces and spreading by contact. And people don’t usually wear masks around their family, because that would be weird. So if just one person happens to get it via surfaces or airborne transmission, it gets their family.</p>
<p>That’s why Fauci did a 180. Now go ahead and downvote me.</p>

<p>Ummmm wtf??  In this very email he is admitting that they do very little except potentially catch large droplets.  That is because we have had years and years of SCIENTIFIC analysis of particles and mask efficiency which he is aware of.  Why don't the people working in a level 4 lab just wear a surgical mask?? Because science tells us it's not effective enough.  Why don't people painting or dealing with harmful chemicals just wear a surgical mask?  Because it doesn't fucking work!!</p>
<p>There is an entire field around the science of masks and proper fitting and testing of m95s and the like, it's pretty clear that surgical masks barely did anything. </p>
<p>Do I blame them for the mandate?  Not at all, deaths were piling up and they had to do something to try and slow the rate.   But when you lie to the public about their effectiveness and give them a safety blanket with holes in it, that's when you kind of lose my trust.</p>
