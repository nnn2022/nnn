        <p>The patients that got admitted to the hospital to begin with are the ones that end up with long term complications. That's one third of a very small number. But, of course, branch covidians only read titles.</p>

        <p>Yeah, what is a few thousand people dead or alive in the UK.</p>
<p>A drop in the bucket, right? Who cares.</p>
<p>That's why everyone kept calm after 9/11, since it was only a few thousand people, in a country of hundreds of millions. They won't be missed.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Besides, it's not like these deaths are avoidable, by just following some rules that keep everybody safe, for a few more months, until the vaccines are rolled out to enough people that we get herd immunity, right?</p>

<p>Welcome to society. We, the majority, voted in those politicians that do what is needed to keep us as safe as is reasonably possible.</p>
<p>Please piss off to Antarctica (because no other country will take your selfish, infected ass) if you don't like the concept of society, but while there, please stay from the scientists. We want to keep those healthy.</p>

<p>Well, I mean, we all think this way when thousands die of flu every year. Including you. Everyone shrugs their shoulders to those deaths, even though those deaths are also "avoidable" by introducing "some rules that keep everybody safe".</p>
<p>Why don't we care about those deaths? Is it because those deaths are just a part of every day life? (Rhetorical question, obviously).</p>

<li>Flu has a much lower mortality rate than COVID</li>
<li>Flu is not preventable, the way COVID is.</li>
<li>Flu is not expected to go away after a few months, when the vaccine is rolled out to the point of herd immunity</li>
<li>Flu doesn't cause long-lasting lung and brain damage or whatever other shit COVID does to people who were sick, but survived it</li>
<li>(Arguably the same point as the first one) Flu did not cause <strong>half a million people dead</strong> in the US, in roughly one year</li>
</ul>
<p>And let's remember: those half million dead are <strong>with actual measures</strong> in place. For the flu, the US has yearly death rates of 15K-40K. Those flu numbers are <strong>without any measures</strong>.</p>
<p>If we would have just as few measures for COVID, as we have for flu, we'd have <strong>millions dead</strong> in the US. (Because not only would the number of infected go up, but cases that can be treated now, won't be treated then, because all the ICUs and hospitals are full.)</p>
<p>And even then, there is continuous, ongoing work on flu vaccines. Every year, many, many people get a flu vaccine. But the kind of vaccine that is now available for COVID, just isn't there for the flu. They are very different beasts.</p>

        <p>&rt;Flu has a much lower mortality rate than COVID</p>
<p>Negligibly</p>
<p>&rt;Flu is not preventable, the way COVID is.</p>
<p>How so? All we've heard is how we haven't had the usual flu numbers and deaths <em>because</em> of the 'covid measures' from people desperately trying to explain away the absence</p>
<p>&rt;Flu is not expected to go away after a few months, when the vaccine is rolled out to the point of herd immunity</p>
<p>Neither is covid, hence all the talk of tweaked formulations and 'boosters'</p>
<p>&rt;Flu doesn't cause long-lasting lung and brain damage or whatever other shit COVID does to people who were sick, but survived it</p>
<p>It absolutely can, and does</p>
<p>&rt;(Arguably the same point as the first one) Flu did not cause half a million people dead in the US, in roughly one year</p>
<p>Neither did covid...</p>
<p>&rt;And let's remember: those half million dead are with actual measures in place. For the flu, the US has yearly death rates of 15K-40K. Those flu numbers are without any measures.</p>
<p>&rt;If we would have just as few measures for COVID, as we have for flu, we'd have millions dead in the US. (Because not only would the number of infected go up, but cases that can be treated now, won't be treated then, because all the ICUs and hospitals are full.)</p>
<p>Absolutely no proof of that, in fact the evidence goes the other way...cases and deaths didn't measurably drop after mask mandates (in almost all cases they had no marked effect or cases actually spiked)</p>

        <p>Is this fear mongering. I say probably. Firstly who did the study? Researchers from the ONS. The ONS that look at statistics, not medical records. OK, so did they look at why the people were in hospital? Sure they got a positive covid test, what does that mean... Erm not a great deal.</p>
<p>So they checked the stats on 48k people that were in hospital and tested positive for covid. OK, but some were in for other reasons, right? Or was everyone in the UK that tested positive on admittance only in hospital due to symptoms from covid? I don't think so somehow.</p>
<p>So we have bunch of people of various ages that are sick enough to go to hospital in 2020. Even if they only had symptoms of covid, these people would have to have a weak enough immune system to require hospitalisation. </p>
<p>OK so far we can safely say that a percentage of the people were in hospital for other health problems, and a percentage of those may have been chronic health problems, morbid obesity, heart problems, other illnesses, accidents etc. And the people that were only in hospital due to covid are obviously weaker at fighting of viruses. </p>
<p>So when they come out with the line that some of these people need to go back to hospital and some of them die, is this not absolutely to be expected based on what we can surmise? I have taken the same information and demonstrated that hospital readmittance and death is more likely to occur if people are sick enough to go to hospital in the first place, whatever the reason.</p>
<p>I am left wondering what the readmittance rate and subsequent death of readmitted population would have been in the UK in say 2017. One in 8?  But then again I don't work for the Guardian, and am not paid by the bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to manufacture fear porn out of predictable statistics.</p>

        <p>100% of people who've never had COVID end up in hospital at least once in their lifetime. Therefore, not having COVID is regarded as dangerous and puts pressure on the health care system.</p>

        <p>Readmitted for what?  </p>
<p>That language suggests they're admitted again for the same thing they were originally admitted for.</p>
<p>A man breaks his leg. He goes to the hospital. He gets tested. It's positive, although he doesn't have symptoms.</p>
<p>3 months later he tears the ACL in his leg. He gets readmitted to hospital.</p>
