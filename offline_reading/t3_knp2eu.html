    <strong>There is nothing logical about lockdowns and they also don't work.</strong>
    <p><p>I can prove lockdowns don't work just by giving example of some countries like mine, we locked down hard when we had less than 30 cases which in itself is ridiculous but that was in march when the panic was in it's peak, anyways cases never reached a high number but we were still in lockdown all the way until may.</p>
<p>Then in the summer we had a second wave and they again introduced some measures not a straight up lockdown but nevertheless there were again many restrictions, cases never really fell.</p>
<p>Then in october/november we had our third wave, and we straight up went to a march style lockdown and currently we are still in one.</p>
<p>If the lockdowns were so effective why do you need new ones? Also the people who say that ''US didn't lockdown hard enough'' and that's why it's so bad over there are full of bullshit, in my country we locked down really hard I am talking everything except big supermarkets and pharmacies was closed, but then cases went from under 10 a day in may/june to close to 5,000 cases a day in october/november.</p>
<p>So lockdowns don't work and they should have never even been tried.</p></p>

        <p>That is why lockdown politicians, public "health" experts and fearmongering media must be held publicly accountable Nuremburg-style. Never again.</p>

        <p>I’m pretty sure they realize it to. At least here in the US, it’s about <em>what</em> you are doing on public display, whether or not it works in real life. Lockdown politicians know they will get praise for “caring” from people that voted for them, when in actuality, it’s hurting more people than it’s helping.</p>

        <p>This... my parents would have been fine and dandy staying at home IF the idiots at the hospital had not said "Your hubby needs a coronary artery triple bypass!" to my Mom and insisted on doing it in February at the height of the coronavirus epidemic.</p>
<p>I am almost 100% certain that if they had DELAYED my father's CAB until November, both he AND my mother (who caught CoVid-19 from Dad when the rehab center sent him home in April) would still be alive.</p>
<p>Main reason why I contacted a lawyer was that even though the rehab center knew they had cases... actual symptomatic cases... of CoVid-19? They didn't do a test on Dad before sending him home! That is the epitome of negligence.</p>

        <p>Politicians have dug their grave. Now they have “no choice” but to continue down this path of insanity till it benefits them more to open everything up. They’ll drag us down forever until they can save face and go”we knew lockdowns didn’t work but we had to follow such and such health care and such and such science” they can’t admit they made a grievous error so this goes on and on until then. Back in the day, we knew that people were capable of mistakes, now the zombies hold up politicians and health care or science or whatever people as absolute truth. Never capable of error. Logic would dictate that everyone can and will make mistakes. We used to be okay with that. Make a mistake, learn from it and move on. But no, follow the science and lockdowns and mandates when they haven’t made a damn bit of difference in 10 months. Other than ruining a generation of course</p>
