    <strong>Deblasio, nyc extended school closures, and BLM (vent!)</strong>
    <p><p>Since BLM has become strangely intertwined with the lockdown saga, and school closures will negatively impact inner city kids more than those in the toney suburbs, I don't believe this is off topic.</p>
<p>This week there were two homicides in my borough that were almost certainly gang related; gang related violence saw an uptick during lockdown. A 21 year old man gunned down in the back and left dead on the street. A 34 year old man shot and killed. Both black men.</p>
<p>No one cares. A couple articles in our terrible local paper, but nothing else. Not even city wide coverage. Certainly not national. No politicians spoke out. No groups organized so much as a candlelight vigil. Nothing. No murals, no marches, no outcry. It's like these men were nothing to the world.</p>
<p>I think the part of my brain that refuses to accept the loopy logic of lockdowns- 'every life matters even if it costs 10,000 lives to save it-' also refuses to accept the concept of a movement saying black lives matter when <em>no one cares when black people are killed in gang related violence.</em> If black lives really matter, you can't have it both ways!</p>
<p>On top of this deblasio just announced schools are delayed again in reopening. The DOE hasn't released stats but based on what I've heard from teacher LESS than half of kids ever logged into lessons march-june. We got a DoE email pleading with parents to update DOE distributed ipads 'as some have not been turned on even once since distribution.' My daughter's online classes (public high school, 9th), less than half of students are present when the teacher takes attendance - and these are honors classes!</p>
<p>So again my brain can't compute 'black lives matter but screw all public school students in a system with a huge amount of disadvantaged black students.' Again, you can't have it both ways.</p>
<p>My younger kids are in a small private school that is open full day five days. Compared to the experience their sister in public is having, they may as well be on a different planet.</p>
<p>The end effect on the achievement gap is going to be devastating, but as with everything in the lockdown mentality, they either pretend it's not real or they simply don't care. And even worse, they do this under the guise of altruism.</p></p>

        <p>It’s disgusting.   Closed elementary schools are going to put disadvantaged students in a situation from which many may not recover.   Closed high schools  will lead to more drop outs and more kids recruited into gangs.   Without schools, I suspect a large number of the children of the working poor are unsupervised.   People who can barely afford housing can’t pay more daycare costs.  People who grew up economically privileged have no idea what it’s like to be on the edge of homelessness.</p>

<p>Exactly. And where do pretty much all kids form their social circles? At school. They're going to find that sense of community and belonging SOMEWHERE, after all.</p>

        <p>We just have to keep our cools and weather the storm best we can. We're in a period of chaos and when you're in a period of chaos, things can keep changing quickly. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/i4VJ5dhiOrQ">There's a reason it feels like we're under attack.</a></p>
<p>Keep venting in a civil manner, and above all, keep speaking your truth. We might come out of this stronger than before.</p>
