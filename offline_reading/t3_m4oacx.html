    <strong>Girlfriend all of a sudden wants to get the vaccine‚Ä¶</strong>
    <p><p>She works in a field of healthcare and didn‚Äôt want it at first. All of sudden she wants it now and I can‚Äôt seem to convince her that it‚Äôs a terrible idea. I don‚Äôt know what to do. Is it crazy to break up with someone who takes it? I don‚Äôt know if I could reproduce with someone that has taken it.</p></p>

        <p>Show her any information you can find about how it isn‚Äôt really a vaccine. If she still wants it, that‚Äôs on her, and you‚Äôll have to make your own decision.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crazy if you end the relationship. For that or any other reason. Do what‚Äôs right for you</p>

        <p>My kid's father went from telling me he's "afraid they're gonna force my wife to take it for work" to one day her just telling me she got both doses. She had no idea it was mRNA. She was told by a nurse that it was just like the flu shotü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èNow I just pray she doesn't turn my ex and he starts pushing it on our kid. He's against all this for now. If it wasn't for him, I'd have already taken our kid back to FL. </p>
<p>I hope you can change her mind. I find it bizarre for someone to flip like that. I could maybe understand doing it to keep your job, but that's not what this sounds like. I wonder if it's peer pressure. Makes me glad I never cave to that.</p>
