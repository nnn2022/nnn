    <strong>What's next? Some predictions of what's coming over the next couple of years</strong>
    <p><p>I've been thinking a lot and looking into what we might expect to happen soon in the world, in regards to the 'new normal'. Here's what I think could happen. </p>
<p>We'll continue to see the push for mass vaccination get more and more fierce and desperate. The attack on those who dare not inject themselves will be vicious. In 6-12 months, we'll start to see a significant increase in deaths from people who have been vaccinated (perhaps due to something like ADE), but this will be blamed on some 'new super deadly strain!!' or 'COVID-21/22'. </p>
<p>There'll be massive food and supply shortages + economic collapse. I suspect we have less than a year until shit hits the fan in this regard. Fuck. After a while, the government will most likely start to implement something like a UBI or some sort of aid to help people out... on the condition that they meet several criteria, like being able to show proof of vaccination. That, and/or a new digital monetary system will be implemented. </p>
<p>(It's also possible that people's immune systems will be weakened from having taken the vaccine, and this, plus being pretty weak from lack of good nutrition and food due to the shortages, will leave people very vulnerable to even the nicest of viruses... just a thought) </p>
<p>I think it is also highly likely that we'll see some sort of cyber attack/cyber pandemic that will take down the power grid and/or internet for a while. Maybe at the same time as all the food and supply shortages. </p>
<p>Then, later on, will come the weaponisation of the climate change agenda, forcing people into climate lockdowns and stripping us further of our rights and freedoms under the guise of saving the planet, convincing people that it's necessary by pointing towards the food shortages and blaming them on climate change ("we can't let it happen again! It was disastrous!").  </p>
<p>Anyway, this is just speculation, though I think it's pretty close to how things will go down. The massive food and supply shortages are definitely coming very soon. We're already on such thin fucking ice, and now the that the mainstream has finally started planting the seeds of it being a possibility, well... </p>
<p>What do you guys think is going to happen in our more immediate future? And what can we possibly do to prepare ourselves for it?</p></p>

        <p>I think they will really begin to ramp up their discrimination against the unvaccinated, and I think they will really try to make this discrimination common place.</p>
<p>Their stupid vaccine won't work, or there will be new variants, or people will still get sick even if they've gotten the vaccine.</p>
<p>And they will blame the unvaccinated for this.  </p>
<p>This will lead to segregation, and an outright cultural war in our society.  This reminds me of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, where in group members would harass, attack, humiliate members of the out group.  The result of which is self censorship due to a sense of self preservation, and conformity to an authoritarian regime.</p>
<p>I believe we are witnessing some sort of a cultural / political coup.  This is by design.  There is a purpose to all of this.</p>

        <p>Keep an eye on how the hurricane season plays out in the United States.  I predict the following:</p>
<p>People being rejected from government shelters if they're not vaccinated.  Or clear differences in the quality of shelter for vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Denial of FEMA assistance until you get the shot, due to "health concerns".</p>
<p>Significant delays in federal aid to Republican states as a form of retaliation and arm twisting.</p>

        <p>I definitely think the mask/no mask is going to divide society even more and label those with a mask as "dangerous" and "unsafe". It is going to get harder to do things such as shop and travel. I dont know how many people (including businesses) are willing to stand up against this clown world. But we must.</p>

        <p>As a food manufacturer, I can tell you that the FDA/USDA makes it nearly impossible for small, quality producers to exist; especially in the world of animal fats &amp; protein. My business will either be wildly successful in this scenario and I will be proud to provide healthy food to my community, or .gov will just totally cripple us outliers and keep everyone in the bread line. </p>
<p>The campaign against C02 and animal farming is a total strawman that will destroy the actual sustainable/regenerative farmers who are a net positive, long before making a dent in industrial agriculture. But that's what they (.gov &amp; their crony corporate partners) want. Climate change is just the cover.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it's likely that most small/family businesses will be destroyed by all this mess (just look at the last year already), unfortunately, though I hope your business survives and thrives!</p>

        <p>Ah, yes, of course! And eventually, none of us will be allowed to eat meat anymore, at all. Everything else will be heavily restricted. Rationing during the food shortage/crisis could very easily become permanent ("because of the planet!").</p>

        <p>It has an official name, Agenda 21, which has been changed to Agenda 2030, and/or The Great Reset. Trump was ruining the “elite’s” plans for the New World Order, which is why they manipulated the election and stole it in 2020. I’m surprised they didn’t try to eliminate him all together. We are headed for some really dark times, and it doesn’t help that at least 40% (I’m being optimistic) of the population are brain dead sheep who are going along with everything the government says. It’s like being awake during surgery to watch this shit unfolding and know what’s happening.</p>
