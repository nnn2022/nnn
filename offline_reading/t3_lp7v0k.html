    <strong>Questions that no one can seem to answer,,,</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>If masks and social distancing are so effective at stopping COVID and flattening the curve, then why do we need a vaccine?</li>
<li>If the vaccine is so highly effective, then why do we still have to wear masks after receiving 2 rounds of the vaccine?</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If the vaccine provides systemic immunity but not "mucosal immunity", where the virus attacks, then what good is the vaccine at protecting anyone?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If natural COVID infection provides mucosal protection, then why should someone who had a mild and confirmed case of COVID with strong antibody production, plus 2 rounds of vaccine, have to wear a mask at all (once the 2 week post-vax period has passed)?</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, I am that person. I had confirmed COVID in December. It was virtually nothing. No fever, no cough, no aches, only a loss of smell and taste. That. Was. All. Yet I had to get a test and yes, they said it was positive. Yet, my husband, who sleeps just inches away from me for at least 8 hours a night, and we kiss and share drinking glasses and stuff... he never got sick. Not even a sniffle. No loss of smell and taste. And this shit's supposed to be SO CONTAGIOUS, right??</p>
<p>So, why do I have to wear a mask if I have had 2 rounds of vaccine, plus natural infection... for a stupid bug that didn't even make me as sick as a cold. And yes, I have "other health conditions", so I don't think that's even much of a factor. Hubby has health issues too and didn't get sick. </p>
<p>So tell me again... why do I need a mask to buy groceries?</p></p>

        <p>I still say this is very little about medicine. Yes there is a virus. It can kill some people just like the flu or pneumonia. But the masks and lockdowns and all that they took from us is a test of compliance. How far can they push people. Nations like Russia. India. China. They just aren‚Äôt locking it down forever. But the western nations need to see what happens when they fuck with us. I think america is getting ready to change strictness. They pissed off white males and in one day a cosplayer and baked Alaska were in Pelosi‚Äôs office. One day. Mostly 99.9% unarmed. Imagine if the people weren‚Äôt on a political side but on a freedom side. We literally run this shit we just refuse to show it very often.</p>

        <p>Yup, and here's your prize from my magic tote bag, since I am too po' to afford Reddit prizes.  üèÜ </p>
<p>You know, those lockdowns and shutdowns cost me my job, and killed my place of employment completely. And guess what? I am one of the few who didn't qualify for ANY of the "freebie handouts", not even unemployment in my state. So if anyone thinks I'm gonna play the game for no prizes, and end up losing everything... screw them.</p>

        <p>I lost 6 figure salary. 33 years of work at one job. Great benefits. I‚Äôm ok for now because of stocks I had. I get $404 a week in unemployment. No healthcare. No stimulus checks.

        <p>Back in late February 2020, my husband got what we thought was the flu (hes never had the flu before). Hacking dry cough, headache and serious fatigue that lasted a little over a week. I thought I was done for, as we share a bed and close quarters and all. I got nothing but a day of fatigue and a slight cough. Deadly disease. Sure. It‚Äôs all bullocks</p>

        <p>I don't wear one, except to placate a certain person who is a person with severe disabilities. She is truly at risk of serious infection... I believe that a small subset of the population can experience life threatening illness, and this is a neighbor. Other than that... no mask. HOWEVER, I worked for many years in veterinary medicine, and wore a mask as part of my job sometimes. Zoonotic illnesses are a real thing, and so are iatrogenic infections. They have a place, but not in the general society, for everyone all the time.</p>

        <p>I understand and agree with everything you said with the exception of (why do I have to wear a mask). If you feel a need for one, wear it. If you don't, then don't. Nobody has to wear a mask in daily life. That's a victim mentality. I wasn't arguing that sometimes you may feel the need.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the "breakdown" was in the initial wording of my post... I was basically questioning why our government tells us that we "have to wear a mask", even after vaccines, even if we have verifiable antibodies, and even though they DON'T FREAKIN' WORK against viruses, except MAYBE a real N95 respirator... <strong><em>maybe</em></strong>. </p>
<p>It's all about control. Fauci is now saying that "masks will be needed through 2022". Huh? At first, "Masks aren't needed", then "Masks for 2 weeks, then we can beat this virus back", to "Masks through the end of 2020", then "Masks till mid 2021", now "Masks through 2022"... how long before they decide "Masks forever"? Screw that.</p>
