    <strong>I just can't put my finger on who this type of behavior reminds me of.....</strong>
    <p><p>&rt; During the Holocaust, Nazis referred to Jews as rats. Hutus involved in the Rwanda genocide called Tutsis cockroaches. Slave owners throughout history considered slaves <strong>subhuman</strong> animals. In <em>Less Than Human</em>, David Livingstone Smith argues that it's important to define and describe dehumanization, because it's what opens the door for cruelty and genocide. </p>

<p>It is genuinely frightening that these people cannot see the way they treat others. Using NAZI as an example for everything can get quite tiresome and lose its punch, but it's a great index to pull from and in regards to human cruelty, control, and brainwashing. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The way we are treated really is that of how a subhuman would be. At times I joke and wonder if I am in a simulation. Why? Because I ended up in a world where I (and many others) have become the Jew, but these people think we are literal Nazis.   </p>
<p>It is almost so insane to think about that you cannot adequately do so within' reason.</p></p>
