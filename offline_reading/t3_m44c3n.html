    <strong>Milgram and the Matrix warned us of their "voluntary" reverse psychology vaccinations</strong>
    <p><p>In the Milgram experiment, people were asked to administer electric shocks to strangers, at the command of a stranger presented as a scientist. They were paid and told they could keep the money no matter the outcome, and never forced to continue, but simply told to. It turned out that half of the test subjects would go as far as to administer a deadly voltage despite the cries of their victim. When asked why they did this, one subject replied "he wouldn't let me stop!", when this was never the case: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOUEC5YXV8U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOUEC5YXV8U</a></p>
<p>It's because of this phenomena that The Matrix 2 is the most important film in history to me, because in the scene with the Architect (that everyone sleeps through), they explained exactly this concept to the wider public: you cannot force people to accept something, because then too many will revolt, but if you give them a well framed choice, the majority will accept it, even if deep down they know it's the wrong choice.</p>
<p>Well that's exactly what they're doing with the vaccine now. They're not forcing it on people, because that would be too suspicious and you'd have mass revolts. But by giving us the choice, and using softer means to push us to accept it, they can get more people to accept.</p>
<p>Most people would say that reverse psychology would not work on them, because it'd be too obvious. Well it looks like at least half of people are about to fall for it. And I shudder to think what the goal is if this really is premeditated, maybe this vaccine really will affect fertility and what not, on purpose. They got away with the biggest crimes in history with the most obvious of lies, I guess they'll try it again now.</p></p>

        <p>Great. Its true</p>
<p>They also keep up the illusion of scarcity, its an old marketing trick. You see it works because people are running for the vaccine and bragging about it online. Peak stupidity.</p>
<p>Thats not the only thing they are doing... there is another psychological trick involved. So we know for a fact all of the mRNA vaccinations are basically evil and they are killing people with it. They are useless too. Now here comes their clever manipulation: the media portrays one of the vaccine producers as bad quality, so everyone thinks the other vaccinations must be fine then and with barely any health risks. The question about the overall safety of the vaccination goes out the window with this for most people</p>
<p>The truth is it is all manipulation and they are all equally bad and useless.</p>

        <p>These shots really must be very deadly. And then they have the nerve to proclaim that when they make a person sick as a dog, it means that "their immune system is working"! Sad that people have been dumbed down to such an extent.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure I see the analogy nor the "softer means" to push the vaccine.</p>
<p>What I'm seeing is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/m42rkp/uk_covid_passports/">vaccination passports</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/m3wnl9/this_has_to_be_the_height_of_propaganda/">blatant arrogant propaganda</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/m3m10a/completely_clear_what_we_are_experiencing_is/">unconstitutional measures</a>.</p>
<p>It's all a sucker punch if you ask me. Nothing subtle about it.</p>

        <p>The softer means are to me, the fact that governments world wide, obscure the fact that its even a vaccine. Its an experimental gene therapy. If people really understood the function, they would run for he hills considering the large anti-GMO movement. By repeating often enough that its a vaccine, they can then call people who still refuse it, anti-vaxxers. Anti-vaxxers have gotten a pretty bad rap over the last decade, and mostly, rightly so. Their concerns were demonstrably ridiculous in most cases.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So you end up with people complying even when they know its wrong, just because of the stigma of being labeled an antivaxxer. Then you have the people who comply so they can stay in society. In the end you have a small enough segment of the population that aren't in on the scam that the truth can be swept under the rug and the public is none the wiser. </p>
<p>The only way to fight the scam is for people who bought in to admit they were duped, (not going to happen), or for enough people to refuse despite all the subversive tactics used to get them to comply. Outcomes look grim at best.</p>

        <p>Little bit of the Standford Prison Experiment too. If you put people into roles they will adapt their behavior to those roles very quickly. Put the average citizen into the role of being "mask police/guards" to the people around them. Tell them its their duty to uphold this role. They will transform into character more easily than one would think and behave in ways they might not normally for the sake of carrying out their "duty".</p>
