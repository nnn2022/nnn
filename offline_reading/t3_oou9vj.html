    <strong>I fear things will continue to get worse, the times that we are living in are definitely not normal.</strong>
    <p><p>I truly fear that if we continue in the direction that we all are heading towards, persecution will come for those who decline to get vaccinated. Where is all of this heading? Will we ever return back to the normal we once knew? With the consistent fear mongering of the media, the divide and conquer tactics being slowly introduced in news articles between the "Vaccinated" and unvaccinated", Delta Variant spreading etc etc etc. All that awaits is a dystopian nightmare. </p>
<p>The elites are using this virus as an excuse to strip us all of our rights, free speech, censor those who question the narrative, and enforce totalitarian rule. What lies at the end of all of that is a "Great Reset" or a "New World Order", and this is the end goal of those in power. What we are witnessing currently is not normal, there's something diabolical behind what's driving all of this. It's as if mass hypnosis has spread throughout the whole world, and we are only diving more and more into it... It truly is terrifying. </p>
<p>I remember when I was younger, reading Revelation 13 for the first time and wondering how could the whole world fall for a false messianic figure known as the Antichrist who will claim to be God incarnate and yet the whole world will worship him? Now it's not so hard to believe anymore, especially since not only will he suffer a mortal wound and revive back from the dead, but his sidekick The False Prophet will be able to perform miracles and signs in order to deceive the whole world. There is a eerie correlation between what's currently going on now, and this bible passage. </p>
<p>It's as if the whole world is in a play before the main actual main event which will come in the near future. Please let me explain. The false prophet will enforce a mark on everyone, this mark is also known as the Mark Of The Beast which will either go on your forehead or right hand. This mark will serve two purposes, one will be that you cannot buy nor sell without it, and the other is a religious purpose; Worshipping the antichrist as "god". For those who will refuse it, they will be persecuted and killed. </p>
<p>I would not be surprised if in the near future, the vaccine will be required in order to participate in society. Let me state that I do not believe that the vaccine is the mark, but I do believe it's a precursor or a foreshadow, similar to how the Great Reset is a small preview of the worldwide governmental system that will be handed over to the antichrist which is spoken of in Revelation 13, 17/Daniel 2(the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzar's statue) and 7( the fourth dreadful beast with 10 horns which represent 10 kings/world leaders.) </p>
<p>Daniel 7 23-25</p>
<p>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</p>
<p>And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</p>
<p>And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</p>
<p>Revelation 13 7-8</p>
<p>And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</p>
<p>And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>Revelation 17 12-13</p>
<p>And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</p>
<p>These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that we are in the end times, because no one knows the day nor hour but we are definitely seeing conditioning or warming people up for what's to come. We can also see how what's prophesied in the book of Revelation is now possible. If the world continues to free fall towards this totalitarian future, then it will give birth to a nightmare beyond our imagination. For those of you who believe in Jesus, put your faith in Him for He is faithful. For those of you who do not believe, please consider what I'm saying. If God does not halt or put a stop to this governmental overreach, then this final worldwide empire will come. </p>
<p>Please pray for our loved ones, friends and everyone that you know who has taken the vaccine for we do not know the potential long term effects of this rushed vaccine. I love you all and God bless each and every one of you.</p></p>

        <p>I am right there with you with the feeling of hopelessness and fear but I think we can still appreciate life and enjoy it. Spend time with people you love, go for a nature walk, have a tasty meal, read a fun book or watch a funny movie. Get some exercise too and try to take breaks from all of this. When you are really exposed to different theories of what’s going on here it can be completely crushing and make everything seem Bleak and pointless. It’s important to step away from it now and then because other than speaking out and resisting there’s really nothing else we can do here. Pay attention to meet ups in your area of like-minded people, there definitely is power in numbers!</p>

        <p>Agreed. All we can do now is continue to spread the truth in love and cherish those who we love like never before. Tomorrow is never promised to anyone, so it's best to spend that time wisely. The thing that are going on in the world wears me down.. But yeah, your right. Sometimes it's good to not focus too heavily on these things.</p>

        <p>Definitely! Simple things mean a lot right now, just going out to buy some vegetables and cooking something tasty is an event for me. Going for a walk outside and exchanging smiles with a Stranger means a lot now. It’s boiling down to very basic things for me at this point</p>

        <p>I am so sorry you are still experiencing this! I have lived like that for the better part of this whole time. It's only within the last couple of weeks that more people are without masks and that's because all of them are vaccinated. If they knew I was not vaccinated and I'm walking around maskless they would hang me. All throughout the winter I was the only person walking around without a mask. I also took my mask off in grocery stores and it caused me such anxiety but at the same time I felt like I had to do it. I felt like people need to see at least one human face, something normal maybe it will encourage the rest of them to do it. A couple of times it actually did. But I'm in New York City and it has been an absolute prison here. Wherever you are I pray for you that it gets better, I don't know what to think about this anymore but I've started praying and turning to God more than I ever have in my life.</p>

        <p>I feel the same about religion and Revelation, the prophecy about most people following after the "beast" is true too. I know this vaxxed woman who goes on about Jesus, why did I get warned and not her, why doesn't she see the complete and utter evil? There's people in other religions seeing the evil too. I'm not sure how that works.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, there are many in christian circles that are totally blind to what's going on, or brush it off thinking everything will eventually go back to normal. There are very few christians that can see beyond the curtain. It's sad that many in the unbelieving world can see what's going on than the sleeping church. That's a fact.</p>

        <p>Most Christians here believe in the narrative, Catholics, conservative Lutherans, mainstream evangelials, SDA and more. I know one fundamentalist [she lives an hour away] who hasn't gotten it. I find myself wondering if my old abusive IFB has lined up or not. I deconverted, so don't know where I am at spiritually now, but wherever it is, I am seeing "spiritually behind the curtain". I used to have a blog warning of things to come, I am glad I did not dismantle it but still have access. It was a bible prophecy and conspiracy blog. It is true many who are not Christians are seeing it happen. Baptist churches here are having vaccination clinics.</p>

        <p>Bingo. The mass hypnosis or delusion that we are seeing today on a worldwide scale is only but a picture to the strong delusion that is coming during the future Tribulation period.</p>

        <p>Nope. If anybody chooses to take the vaccine, that's their own choice. For anyone considering taking the vaccine, pray first and do research. If you feel like it's safe enough to take it then do so. I'm not anti vaccine, I just think that this coronavirus vaccine is unsafe. </p>
<p>As I have stated in my post, I do not believe that the vaccine is the mark but I truly do believe it's a precursor or a foreshadow of the future mark. They are trying to shove these vaccines down the throats of people or manipulate by giving free donuts, lottery tickets and what have you. If you or anyone decides to take the shot, I do not believe it will send you or anyone to hell. </p>
<p>Anyone pushing the unbiblical narrative that the vaccine is the mark of the beast has not truly studied the book of Revelation nor bible prophecy in depth.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your response. I did get vaccinated- and to be honest I don’t know if it was the right decision. I will never have my children get this vaccine but I got it bc at the time I thought it was the right thing to do. I am a Christian and pray that I will live a long and healthy life to be there for my children.</p>

        <p>I don't think the end times are nigh (nobody can know the date and all) but we may very well see a multi-nation order akin to the Soviet bloc and it's satellites that lasts for a few generations before collapsing.</p>

        <p>Your correct, no one knows the day nor hour but Gods Word does tell us that we would know the season. Are we in the season? I cannot say with 100% certainty that we are at the end but with the way things are going, it's definitely a possibility. Either way, what we are tumbling into isn't good. Hopefully, God puts it at a halt.</p>

        <p>Hey, I hope I'm wrong on this.. But the governmental overreach and rushed vaccine is a reality that we are currently facing. I never claimed to be the brightest tool in the shed, and anyone who questions the current narrative is not dumb. It's always better to be cautious than fall into a trap. God bless you.</p>
