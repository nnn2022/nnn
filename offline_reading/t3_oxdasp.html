    <strong>Finally! Manitoba set to stop mask mandates, etc.</strong>
    <p><p>As stated above, this coming Saturday the province of Manitoba in Canada is set to stop forcing businesses to mask mandates. Furthermore, there will be no more limits on the number of patrons that can be inside a business. And, most importantly there will be no more restrictions for restaurants, theatres, public venues, museums where it was only people of the same household or if all are fully vaccinated then multiple households could sit together. That is now gone! So I can finally go to a restaurant and sit with my family from multiple households vaxxed or not! I realise some people are going to go back to their bad habits like not washing their hands and not wearing a mask when they are sick. But, in saying that, fuck these mandates! The only thing I can do is be responsible for my own well being and that's all there was to begin with.  I don't think this fight is over from these authoritarian pricks but I will celebrate with each small victory.</p>
<p>P.S. Went to celebrate and got some beer. I was speaking to the manager at a beer vendor and told him I was happy about the restrictions being dropped. I said some people will be going back to their bad habits and he was like, "oh for sure, especially those anti-vaxxers..." I looked him dead in the eye and told him, "I'm not vaccinated." The fucker literally took a step back and mumbled something about a person's right to choose. Ignorance...</p></p>
