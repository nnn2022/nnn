    <strong>Not engaging</strong>
    <p><p>I do research for myself and to satisfy my curiosity. I don't keep links or write down shit, I just keep it for me. I'm not here to try to convince anyone of anything. I'm trying to find like-minded people to talk with about the bullshit going on in the world and it's just slightly derailing to the conversation to be asked for my sources on shit. I didn't come here to convince you. I found shit out easily enough on my own, so can you. I'm not going to try and dig through months of YouTube videos to find the source for my opinion. It is one I have formed that satisfies me based on how I sift through the lies and propaganda being fed to me. I may be wrong and I'm sometimes even happy to be proven wrong but I will not engage with any "sources plz" fuckery. Go get your own sources if what I'm saying makes you unhappy.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I think everyone needs to be really careful getting locked into "source" wars, because it always comes down to "whose information do you trust?" Watch for people setting you up for their "360 blindfolded slam dunk moment" in which stereotyping and value defamation is justified (this behavior is not limited to a particular group).</p>
<p>In fact, I don't think information is needed at all to see the structure of the situation. If you stick to the literal narrative presented by official sources, and to the actual words/logic of its followers, you can see patterns that require no numbers or charts to describe or understand.</p>
<p>I think people on this sub need to be careful because their "opponents" seem to have a cardboard cutout understanding of the viewpoints here- they have their own reductionist memes used to create a punching bag for themselves. I see a lot of talking down, a lot of presumptuous name-calling and finger wagging. People do that here too and might consider being careful not to create fuel for misrepresentation.</p>

        <p>My boyfriend sees me as such a conspiracy theorist that now I can't show him a simple verified piece of statistical data without him looking it up for himself to see if what I'm showing him is even real.  </p>
<p>I want him to understand, or at least try to ponder my perspective, opinions, ideas, and beliefs, but he never does his own research or watch the videos I send him.  He's one of those people who seem to be set in their ways and opinions, who don't question what the media tells them, which is disappointing because in every other way hes my soulmate.  </p>
<p>Right now we're in a stalemate, waiting to see if the vaccine "does" anything to the masses.  Of course, if it does, the media sure won't let us know.  They'll ignore it until it's widespread and then tell us it's a new strain of covid.  In which case, I'll still be wrong, and there will be nothing I can do to prevent him from getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Normies make me lose faith in humanity.</p>

        <p>That's tough. My husband doesn't want to keep up with the news while we're locked inside but I do. I mentioned the word "communism" yesterday and he told me to put my tin foil hat away. He doesn't think there's a much bigger scheme here heading towards One World Government. So we basically just agree to not talk about what's happening outside that often.</p>

        <p>I’m on your side bro. Just my own two cents, but I think it helps to cite sources, just to use as an anchor or stepping stone for your own research or analysis. But I agree, I tend not to engage shills or those who don’t bother to look at links I provide them.</p>

        <p>All these source wars and blogs and videos are a mess. It'd really be a lot easier to discuss all this stuff if there was a system where we could test people for understanding stuff and give them some kind of acknowledgement that they know more about this than everyone else. This world west "everyone has a source" crap needs to be reigned in.</p>

        <p>Yes you mean Ethylene oxide, that is used as a sterializer in 50% of all medical devices in the US... And while it is true that Ethylene oxide is a carcinogen, the concentration and amount of Ethylene oxide after the sterilisation process is negligible.</p>
<p>You can read more about Ethylene oxide here: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-eo-swabs-idUSL1N2LU1H0">https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-eo-swabs-idUSL1N2LU1H0</a></p>

<p>These tests where labled as:</p>
<p>" Medical Diagnostic Test instruments and apparatus "</p>
<p>before the website updated the product description with COVID-related labels in April 2020. This resulted in the product descriptions on older tables from 2017, 2018 updating to " COVID-19 Diagnostic Test instruments and apparatus ".</p>
