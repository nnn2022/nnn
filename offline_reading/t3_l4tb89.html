    <strong>To those of you that try to wake others up - Why?</strong>
    <p><p>Before 2020 things were less extreme in terms of the legitimacy behind questioning the world. I used to bring some topics up to friends and despite data, visual / audible proof, and other evidence - They refused to believe. This could've been any topic btw, it was just something going against the mainstream narrative.  </p>
<p>Needless to say it never ended well so I stopped talking about it. Keep in mind - I did not bring these topics up on my own but include them in a currently ongoing discussion. I came off as one of the typical buzzwords - Conspiracy theorist, na√Øve, delusional, ect.   </p>
<p>Now they've finally woken up to what's going on, I'll get texts saying "Can you believe people are buying this story!?", or "How can anyone not see how transparent this is? They're lying!".  </p>
<p>And my jaw drops. I have long since given up on ever trying to present the opposite viewpoint of the going narrative to normal people. They think you're crazy, and now it is my friends being told to, and I quote "Take your medicine" LOL. Yes, someone actually said that to them.  </p>
<p>What's funny is that the buddies that I have who are upset at the eternal slumber (So it seems) of this general population are very, very bright. They're more well spoken than I am, they have better temperaments, can present abstract theories / topics in a sense that don't scare people off - Yet still no one takes them as sane anymore.  </p>
<p>So I ask those of you who do this - Why do you even try to wake others up?</p></p>
