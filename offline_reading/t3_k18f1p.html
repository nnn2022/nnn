    <strong>Why are there so many more people that are pro-mask and pro-lockdown than there are people against it?</strong>
    <p><p>So I wouldn't consider myself extreme anti-mask (not one to join a rally, or to cause a scene at a grocery store if there's a mandatory mask requirement). However, I would say that the following apply to me: </p>
<p>- I'm concerned that wearing masks without questioning the necessity of it, in some capacity, is something that shows a lack of critical thinking and also promotes the sense of fear/panic that seems to be a huge issue in our society. Also how effective are they really?? I would think distancing and keeping group sizes to people who you know personally would be a reasonable alternative to mandatory masks.</p>
<p>- I'm skeptical of lockdown measures because the economical/psychological burden has so far, and will continue to be, the main issue this pandemic will cause on our society. Job losses, mental health crises (suicide/overdoses, etc), and loneliness from the elderly population (aren't we trying to protect them??) continue to increase and even after a vaccine people will still be scared to continue life like it was before. </p>
<p>- I have expressed this multiple times: If I was an elderly person in a care home, and I wasn't able to see my friends and family for months, what would even be the point of living?? But I always come across as insensitive when I say this. The thought is "Oh, let's not see Grandma for Christmas this year so we can see her next year." What if she doesn't make it to next Christmas??? </p>
<p>The pandemic has been tough on all of us. Who knows what the best way would have been to deal with it. Anyone from AUS/NZ/Taiwan/any of the other countries able to share what was good/bad about how it was dealt with there?</p></p>

        <p>other than that</p>
<p>the best way to have dealt with it is the way all previous 'pandemics' were dealt with.</p>
<p>no previous 'pandemic have used this rt pcr technique as a 'test', nor did any healthy people get 'tested', nor were any c.o.d rules changed, nor did hospitals get more money for 'cases', and of course there were no mask dictates, anti-social distancing, no shut down businesses and no locking down entire populations of otherwise healthy people.</p>

        <p>1918 flu pandemic calling... yeah, there is some historical standard for this. However after the pandemic ended, they did studies and found out that the masks mandates actually HARMED people and that the social distancing edicts did not 'limit the spread'.</p>
<p>Truth of the real world: A virus is going to virus. It is going to spread and the only thing you can do is cross your fingers and hope it burns out before it gets to your home unless you are willing to stay in your home 24/7/365 until it burns out.</p>

        <p>Interesting. Sure sounds like these old tactics are being brought into the technological age. Instead of brownshirts, we have masks. I'm shocked we aren't asked to wear a star of David on our lapel for easy identification but that's probably what social media is tracking.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's the usual reason given, but that seems rather delusional. </p>
<p>I thinks it's quite obvious that a lot of people actually like to be a slave in this system as long as there are people who are worse off than themselves, who they can abuse.</p>
<p>If it were a mere lack of critical thinking they could be helped, but no there is no way to them, because they know exactly how fucked up tyranny is but aren't too bad off if they go along with it, and as a bonus now can aggress against others.</p>

        <p>&rt;Who are the people who they would be aggressing against in your example?</p>
<p>Everyone not pro-fascism basically. </p>
<p>I mean if you are a critical thinker you are likely so accustomed to it that you take it for granted, but being constantly bullied and insulted for speaking your mind (against fascism for example) is already a bad situation. </p>
<p>But there is way more, calling armed thugs on your neighbors (or whomever) if they happen to have decided voluntary to meet with other people is nazi-level fascism (and who knows how bad it will get, as far as I know there have been several plantations declaring to work on what amounts to concentration camps). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>They may get their property taken from them ("fines") or being put in a cage for literally nothing (nothing new though, you get the same treatment in most places for having green crumbles in your cigarette for example) and that is the infliction of inflicting unjustified violence against them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So basically what I wanted to point out is that there are a lot of people who don't mind living in a fascist system - because it gives opportunities to them to harm innocent others, and all they have to do is go along with the fairy-tale, and they'll do it gladly.</p>

        <p>Fear is a powerful emotion, right? And fear is what has been fueling this pandemic from the get go. In what other circumstances have official authorities had daily press releases stating the number of people that have died from a disease in the past 24 hours? It's not relevant to know how many people died from a heart attack or from cancer, so why is it relevant to know how many people died from covid?</p>
<p>Always focusing on death and using a we're at war with the virus rhetoric, I'm not surprised a lot of people are scared. What people forget is that deaths occurred in 2019 as well. If there were daily press conferences on the number of people dying from diabetes or illnesses related to obesity, people would completely freak out about drinking Coke and eating mayonnaise too. There's a reason why they normally don't talk about death and why they're doing it now. They want people to be scared about it, cause if they are it's easier to get them to comply with the new laws. But I'm yet to understand what the end game for all of this is. Not sure about those great reset theories to be honest. I think they just saw a golden opportunity to maintain more control and have their citizens praise them for it.</p>

        <p>Drinking coke and eating mayonnaise = diabetes = medications = $$$ </p>
<p>But this really doesn’t explain what’s going on here since it’s doing the opposite of making $$$ ... although somehow the S&amp;P is at record highs.. something doesn’t add up lol</p>

        <p>I feel the same way. Like I said, I’m not one to cause a riot, I’m a civil person. Just feel that this has been taken a bit too far and that as a result, people will continue to live in fear for the rest of their lives and that really sucks as someone who loves to travel and attend large sporting events/concerts/etc. </p>
<p>Like I literally have a hard time believing that this will ever get back to what it was before for 3-5 years.. and by then I’ll be past my prime years.. :(</p>

        <p>There aren’t more pro mask pro lockdown people. But the news is biased “in the name of safety”. Social media is biased “in the name of safety”. Search engines are biased “in the name of safety”. Even doctors and nurses who disagree with the restrictions are silenced “in the name of safety”. In my circles (red state) we are the majority, but we’re a quiet passive majority. The minority is very loud and their voice gets echoed on every form of social media until they beat the rest of us into submission.</p>
