    <strong>If there's ANY reason to be protesting right now, it's because we are being denied Constitutional rights (e.g. going to church).</strong>
    <p><p>I won't get into the politics of allowing protests, funerals for George Floyd, etc., while denying us the right to congregate in church, bury our loved ones with respect, etc. but WE should be the ones protesting in the streets, and, IF it goes too far, begin rioting.  Denial of Constitutional rights is the only time it's OK to riot, and it's happening before our very eyes.  We can't do this much longer.  The dam will break.</p></p>

        <p>I found out yesterday that a family member of a client that I support was trying to come and pick the client in question up to go through her deceased sister's things amd the nursing home her sister lived at. Appearently the family member in question was confronted with a call from my manager and said that she was not to go anywhere. My client is not being allowed to attend a cremation ceromony either.</p>
<p>My document logs are overflowing with "NO" in response to the question "Did the client go out into the community today" all with the "explanaition" that the client chose to stay in to minimize risk of exposure to COVID-19. The DSP's(me) are not allowed to do the grocery shopping. The DSP's are to discourage clients who have indepenece in the community to discontinue working and not to go anywhere. The DSP's are to incourage clients to wear masks IN THEIR OWN HOMES. The DSP's are not allowed to give rides to clients to go ANYWHERE except for absolutely necessary health appointments and our saving grace, to go to parks so we can walk. </p>
<p>I love my clients, but I'm sick of my job.I hate seeing my clients this way. I do the best I can every day to get them to even stick to getting out of bed and showering and getting dressed to keep some semblance of routine for them, but literally the highlight of their day is going to the park early enough in the morning to get a good long walk in until it gets too hot for them and we have to go home. I do some arts and crafts, but I'm not increadibly blessed financially and I runnout of supplies. I'm sad for them. I'll lose my job if I take them to like a pet store to look around or go try on clothes at a thrift store holding makeshift fashion shows like we used to. Not to mention I would be ostricised for taking them out because I guess having fun and keeping depression at bay is non essential. </p>
<p>If you live in a group home right now in WA state, you don't have consititutional rights. The head of my company insists that's not what they're calling it. They're saying the clients are choosing to isolate, which isn't true. If i asked any one of them if they wanted to drive out to see their families and have a bbq, they would say yes! I'm just not allowed to ask those questions because those activities are out of the question. I'm not even allowed to take them to get haircuts and I had to help them do it at home! Upper management still believes all of this is justified and their lives are in imminent danger, and I would have to say I agree. Their lives ARE in danger, but not from a virus.</p>

        <p>I'm so sad for your clients. You are truly a good person, to care so much about your clients that that you spend your own money. I am in New York and until the end of last month, special needs and the elderly were totally locked down and isolsted. I have a special needs friend in a group home that was so depressed he lost almost 20 lbs. I finally got to visit him a couple of weeks ago, outside wearing masks at opposite ends of an 8 ft table . Here I guess agencies/homes had to submit plans so they are sll different and lots of agencies are still keeping their clients under hard lockdown. It's neglect and abuse and agencies and govt officials need to be held accountable.</p>

        <p>You hit the nail on the head. The worst part about all of this is that other people I work with are more than ok with it. They take it as "Ooooo I can do the bare minimum and otherwise sit around on my phone all day and get paid for it". But THeYr'E hEroS. Come the fuck on. </p>
<p>I used to want to go into management in my career field. Things at a higher level were pretty bad before March, but they weren't this bad. Now I see the managers know what's happening but are turning a blind eye for safety, and that the state never actually cared about vulnerable people, and they never will. Why should they? It's not profitable for them. I think it's part of the plan tbh. The powers that be want people who are a burden to their utopia gone and are trying to acheive it by any means possible. </p>
<p>I want to take them places besides the park, it would be fairly easy to fudge the numbers on the mileage book, but the only problem is that they would be so excited that they would tell EVERYONE even if I repeatedly asked them to keep it our little secret. And then boom. There goes my income. I thought about looking for work elsewhere becauase it's really starting to get to me mentally, but so far no luck.</p>

        <p>I wish you the best. But wish in one hand, shit in the other. :/</p>
<p>Stories like yours are so valuable, just like the stories of those who must enforce mask mandates they oppose or risk losing their job. I see people in healthcare and other related fields and - despite my own childhood passion for healthcare, nursing, counselling, etc - often lump them in with health officials like Fauci. Or this absolutely neurotic Redditor who claims to be a medic. Or the doctors who deny DNR requests to string along the sick and elderly against their will. These assumptions are very wrong of me, but I hope you understand where I'm coming from.</p>
<p>It's a shame that your clients wouldn't be able to keep any adventures a secret. Can't really blame them though, they're caged animals right now and of course they would be bursting with joy if allowed to actually live a little. Hopefully things change for the better soon enough. I know it's never so simple as "just" getting a new job, especially in the current economy. And you'd be leaving people you care about with others who seem to not care so much. You're a good person, probably the best DSP there.</p>
<p>Not really sure what else to say, aside from hope for the best and prepare for the worst. This clearly isn't just about the virus.</p>

        <p>Yes, you really should. The sooner people step out and demand their lives back, the sooner it will happen. Never in history have politicians willingly returned the rights they appropriate from their people and the power that they get from that appropriation. You have to take it back. </p>
<p>If I was in my own country, I'd have been out protesting from day one. As is... if I protest, I get deported and my partner ends up homeless.</p>

        <p>It isn't just about "muh" rights though, it's about everyone's rights. Even the people who claim they don't want those rights. They might change their mind about that, but it might be too late by then if we don't do something now.</p>

        <p>Yes. If we don't protest now, our only options will be to comply with whatever new rules or escape this madness by going off-grid. Personally, I prefer the latter option, a movement for everyone of all stripes to build off-grid communities that suit their own wants and needs. Whether or not we protest, large nations will eventually implode into smaller communities anyway. Such tyranny as we see today signals the death throes of a civilization.</p>

        <p>Protesting  would only work if huge numbers did it and constantly. Even then they'd use it as an excuse for more deaths. I'd rather do exactly as they say and more, then refuse to return to normal when they tell you to saying you're too afraid of the Virus beat them with their own stick. Keep wearing Masks when they tell you not to</p>

        <p>You think that the virus would have magically disappeared after 2-3 weeks of lockdown? You are the one living in clown world, buddy. Don’t be a troll. You clearly have no fucking clue how viruses work. </p>
<p>Im a physician so I have to go to work whether there is a lockdown or not, so I really don’t care what the fuck you do. Just don’t let me see you out in public while there is a dangerous virus going around. </p>
<p>Remember lockdowns definitely work and the only way they don’t work is if people like you don’t follow the rules. Stay the fuck inside until the virus is eradicated.</p>

        <p>If we had a full scale lockdown, we’d be much better off.  You’re a terrible physician if you think otherwise and I pray for your patients...</p>
<p>LIBERATE MICHIGAN!</p>
<p>Just remember that when you try to argue against the fact that there has been opposition for no good reason this entire time.</p>
<p>Also, I’m not saying it magically disappears.  It’s a lot better than Trump’s theory of, “It will be gone by April,” or, “If it gets warmer it will just disappear,” though lol</p>
