    <strong>Good News</strong>
    <p><p>Good morning brothers and sisters! I hope you are doing well. If you have any prayer requests please let me know. A kind word or action can make the difference between a soul coming to Christ and a soul remaining lost in darkness. May God grant you wisdom to know what to say to speak to the hearts of the lost.</p>
<p>James 5:16 (KJV)  Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:22-25 (KJV)  Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:
And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;
Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</p>
<p>Our Father in Heaven, we praise Your Holy Name. We are overwhelmed at what Jesus has done for us! May our prayers, thoughts and actions all bring glory and honor to You.  In Jesus Name we humbly pray, Amen. Have a wonderful, blessed day.</p></p>

        <p>Did I say anything one way or the other telling someone whether they should get it or not? Or did  I merely state my beliefs. Something I am allowed to do as a citizen in this country.</p>
<p>How exactly do I benefit either way? The better question would be what does God think of the state of the world He created. Sin and immorality running rampant. People starving on the streets. Violence and crime on the rise. And yet with all these problems you find nothing more constructive to do than criticize my beliefs? It is everyone's own choice rather they get the vaccine or not. My personal choice is not to. God bless you and keep you and yours safe.</p>

        <p>First: your right to express your beliefs is no greater than my right to disparage your beliefs. You have no right to protection from hurt feelings.</p>
<p>Second: whataboutism. Everything we do is meaningless in the context of global suffering. It's a lazy cop-out to avoid facing valid criticism.</p>
<p>Finally: your choice to avoid a vaccine doesn't just hurt you. It hurts children and other vulnerable people that you directly or indirectly contact.</p>
<p>Look. I really do hope you don't get sick. It's a terrible disease. But imagine you get sick, and you fully recover with medical help. And one day in, I hope, the distant future when you meet your maker, He will show you the consequences you did not see. The man on the bus who you infected, who took it home to his 2-year old, who ended up with lifelong neurological symptoms. The woman who brought it home to her mom, undergoing treatment for cancer, who would have survived but was taken too early by your action.</p>
<p>And for what? For your selfish desire to make a "personal choice"?</p>
<p>Come on brother. Join the half of the country that's still sane.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if I sound harsh.</p>

        <p>It's actually less than half of the country but that's a minor detail. Anyway, I really hope that you don't get sick from the vaccine and our children should be outside breathing in fresh air, getting dirty and building their immune systems up. Eating healthy foods, taking vitamins, socializing and learning about facial cues. So, since we're talking hypothetical situations, what about the teenager whose parents made the decision for her to get vaccinated but now 7 to 10 years later can't get pregnant? Or the teenage male who has an inflamed heart? There are choices to be made on both sides it seems. Make the one that is best for you and your family. Stay blessed.</p>

        <p>No offense intended, but you don't know much of anything about me. I never said you couldn't express your opinions either. You have not hurt my feelings. I don't ride a bus. In the middle of nowhere where I'm at that would be a luxury. There is one store and no traffic lights. I respect your opinion, but I have my own to. May God bless you and keep you safe.</p>
