    <strong>Feeling discouraged and sad. Anyone else?</strong>
    <p><p>With the exception of my parents, my small extended family (like, 6 of us total) just canceled Thanksgiving and Christmas without batting an eye. I even suggested we all get tested beforehand, and nope. It's really disappointing and depressing because the holidays are by far my favorite time of year. The holiday season is always this small light I have to look forward to each year, and this really puts a damper on it. </p>
<p>We haven't gotten together since last Christmas, which is NOT normal for us. We're not super close but we typically get together 3-4 times per year, including holidays. I'm the only one (again, with the exception of my parents) who's even bothered to check-in and ask how everyone is doing these past 9 months. As much as I hate to admit, I think part of it is that they've come to resent my parents and I as our political beliefs and values don't match up with theirs (they're wayyy off the deep-end Liberals who seem to become more misguided with time). We've done nothing to push our beliefs on them. Of course we've had the typical debates around the dinner table regarding politics, but it's never been that serious and it's certainly never anything we haven't squashed before leaving the table. </p>
<p>Anyway, this year has really made me question the quality of my family relationships and I'm really bummed about it.  I feel really alone. Life is way too short to not prioritize and value our loved ones.</p></p>

        <p>Wow.  That is sad.  We have had 4 family reunions this year with family flying in from all over.  No tests. No worries.  We live our lives.  When we realized this is basically a strong flu, everyone chilled. We haven’t cancelled a single holiday and won’t be cancelling Xmas or Thanksgiving.   Even an 86 year old family member who was cowed into fear up until June with a mask and no hugs......showed up to our summer reunion and had that mask off within 10 minutes and enjoyed every damn hug.  Even a very Lib relative visited from
Across the country and we didn’t hesitate to hug. I’m not bragging to make ya feel bad, but showing that following govt orders to avoid family and parties abs life is ridiculous. If people are not actively sick, wash hands...it’s treated just like flu.</p>

        <p>What is more likely that your family is "way of the deep end liberals" or that you have right wing extremist views. The political spectrum has shifted so far to the right the last couple decades that what was once considered center/center right people now call far left. I'm betting your family fits into that category. And you who spend way too much time on r/conspiracy, and a bit of a covid denier, and prejudice against the Chinese are the one actually off the deep end. If you cannot acknowledge the shifting of the spectrum and that much of the right wing party has moved into radical right wing terratory, it's not them it's you.</p>
