    <strong>Not a single case of flu detected by Public Health England in 2021</strong>
    <p><p>The flu which affects millions of people per year has suddenly vanished. Awesome guys these lockdowns are working! Lets keep doing this forever. I just feel so darn safe. How dare you say the flu has been rebranded? Sounds like a conspiracy to me... *SARCASM*</p></p>

        <p>Well duh you stupid person - we beat the flu by wearing masks and socially distancing. It's kinda obvious. Now if we could just get those same people to wear masks and socially distance for covid we could be through this already.</p>

        <p>So why don't people who don't give a fuck get the flu then ? There's a lot of people who stopped caring or never did, not all of them have covid (arguably, a very small minority). Why don't they get sick from the flu ?</p>

        <p>because covid is much more infectious then the flu, it’s takes longer to show symptoms so people will unknowingly pass it on to people and the incubation period is longer. there is also new vaccines each year for the flu</p>

        <p>tbh i’m from the UK and haven’t seen any news about US covid/flu cases so i can’t really comment, i’d just be guessing. but just because florida isn’t in lockdown it’s still a personal choice whether you go out or not and people will still be cautious and wear masks, wash hand etc.</p>

        <p>So you just go to Google and grab the first statistic that agrees with you without bothering to actually look into it further. Snapshot figures are meaningless. Overall per capita numbers for the two states remain nearly the same. </p>
<p>California has 9% population testing positive, Florida has 8.8%.</p>
<p>California and Florida both have a 0.1% death rate.</p>

        <p>what ever evidence i give you you will just state it’s fake news or media propaganda. so why do you believe your stats over mine? because those stats agree with your argument? you can’t just state the numbers i said are fake because it means you’re wrong and your numbers are right because it makes me wrong, seems a bit hypocritical to me.</p>

        <p>I never said your numbers are "fake". I said they are a snapshot of a larger statistic, which when presented out of context mean nothing. </p>
<p>The statistic you commented is true. It's just not important to the overall conversation. You're cherry picking numbers that suit you. I'm not interested in discussing the numbers from a single day or week. They are irrelevant. </p>
<p>Look at the overall per capita numbers I posted and tell me I'm wrong.</p>
<p>How is it exactly that Florida has nearly the same (or better) figures than California?</p>

        <p>like i said before, i'm not from the US and i don't know what the lockdown laws are or what states have lockdown policies, so i don't know any of the numbers. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-do-california-and-florida-have-similar-covid-19-case-rates-the-answer-is-complicated">this articles explains though why CA and FL have similar covid deaths</a>. makes sense now why you keep focusing on those two states - as they fit your narrative.</p>

        <p>What magnificent audacity you have, to post a nonsense article that doesn't actually explain anything, that uses misleading language to deliberately hide the fact that the supposed experts don't really know anything about this virus; and accuse other people of having a narrative. You really are something special.</p>
<p>I don't care where you're from, this information is available online to anyone willing to do basic research. </p>
<p>You literally just went on Google and posted the first article you found that agrees with you. At this point in the conversation I'm not sure why I expected something else. </p>
<p>The "experts" can't tell me or anyone else why lockdowns work. So why should I support lockdowns? Why should I, or anyone else, give up our rights when there's no evidence that this method controls the spread of the disease?</p>

        <p>well i don’t know how to help you then, i give you basic evidence of how lockdowns are effective by saying FL had 2000 cases more then CA, even though CA has a much higher population and for some reason you said that wasn’t good enough and wouldn’t accept it. so instead i send an article, which by the way wasn’t the only one, there was loads all saying the same things, and again you say it’s false and wouldn’t accept it. then claim i’m ‘something special’ like i sent you something from the dark web and claim it uses misleading language and nonsensical, it seemed pretty self explanatory to me.</p>
<p>the FL and CA scenario is clearly the anomaly here as every other state and country in the world has had effective lockdown policies. so please, you tell me how lockdowns haven’t worked? as you have actually gave no evidence that lockdowns don’t work and the governments are taken away our freedoms </p>
<p>there is clear evidence they work, cases drop after two weeks after they are applied and less people have died in places like NZ, China and Norway where they have had strict lockdowns. </p>
<p>But go ahead, pretend your rights are being taken away and think masks/lockdowns are there to silence and control you. surely you seeing places like NZ who are back to normal and free makes you want to take this seriously as the longer you refuse to believe it’s real the longer you’re going to be in lockdown.</p>

        <p>okay, so please tell me why you think that, i’m really not here to troll or argue i genuinely want to know why people believe lockdown are against our freedoms. let me be clear, i’m not enjoying being in lockdown, no one wants to be in a lockdown but we know it’s for the greater good to help saves lives and get back to life as normal. we are also against ‘the new normal’, but i believe lockdowns work as demonstrated in other parts of the world and no lockdown measures prolong the ‘new normal’. you can’t just call me braindead, naive etc when i give you evidence then when i ask for your evidence you don’t give me anything and just say we don’t have any common terms. </p>
<p>every time is ask someone here why they believe the government are keeping us in a lockdown if they aren’t effective they can never give me an answer, they just give me a vague conspiracy theory about population control, but never say what the advantage is of having the population under control. why would the government want to take away our freedoms? how can all the governments and world leaders agree to create a fake virus and pandemic to keep us locked away in our homes without it being challenged or leaked?</p>

        <p>oh come on, i’m literally giving you an opportunity to tell me why you think like this and you can’t even give a simple explanation. you haven’t given me anything at all and yet you want me to believe what you’re saying is true. </p>
<p>you call it a hypothetical threat when you haven’t give any proof, again, why you think it’s fake and the things i tell you, you instantly disregard without offering any alternative evidence. the government are here to look after the people of their country, they govern us. so yes they do have the authority as we elected them to be in charge. they then do things for us like build roads, schools, hospitals and make laws etc. at the moment there is a dangerous virus going around the globe killing people and in order to combat this we need to quarantine and limit social interaction. covid deniers then argue that it’s fake and it’s just a made up pandemic to keep us all lock inside and take away our freedoms; so tell me why you think this as i still haven’t gotten an answer from anyone on this sub</p>

        <p>I don't owe you an explanation of my beliefs. If I believe the government should or should not have certain abilities that is my personal business, and I don't need to explain it to you.</p>
<p>If you feel comfortable having a government that can do whatever it wants whenever it wants, that's your business. Building roads and hospitals is a lot different than telling a private citizen, who has committed no crime, who hasn't even been accused of a crime, that they have to hide in their home indefinitely is (in my opinion) government overreach. </p>
<p>If I choose to go out and live my life it should be my choice. If you want to hide inside for the rest of your days on this Earth you are welcome to do so.</p>
<p>You claim that there is a dangerous virus going around. I'm not arguing that the virus doesn't exist, but I believe it to be less dangerous than you are claiming. I work in the healthcare industry. I have personally seen the effects of the virus and the type of people it primarily affects. I NEVER said the virus is "fake" Don't put words in my mouth.</p>
<p>You also claim that "in order to combat this we need to quarantine and limit social interaction". I have given you direct evidence that lockdowns are ineffective at reducing the covid numbers. You ignored this evidence. Probably because it goes against your worldview that the government should make all of your decisions for you. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I believe that lockdowns are a violations of our civil liberties, and I will never support them.</p>

        <p>someone else said it was fake, not you, sorry. governments make rules to try and protect people though, so are you saying there should be no laws against murdering people because the government can’t tell you what to do, and if you want to murder people then that’s your choice? no of course not. so how is this any different, the lockdown rules are there because if an at risk person catches covid they will most likely die or because seriously ill, we need to limit the spread, and this is done through quarantine and vaccination. you going out and ‘living your life’ is putting so many people at risk and it’s not fair that someone making an essential trip could catch it and die just because just wanted to go outside and don’t believe lockdowns are working. now if lockdowns are ineffective like you’re saying then why are the governments still doing them? </p>
<p>the only figures you gave me were that california and florida had the same death rate per capita, i then linked you to an article which you just said was nonsensical, without giving me a reason why it was nonsensical. i also said that florida had 2000 more daily cases then california, and you claimed that wasn’t good enough without saying why our providing any other evidence. you only seemed focused on them two states as they are clearly the anomaly. you didn’t respond to the fact NZ are back to normality through effective lockdowns. so don’t say i didn’t provide you evidence that lockdowns work when you can only give me one example, which i’ve answered.</p>
<p>the fact is that you don’t want to support a lockdown because they inconvenience you slightly and stopping you from living a normal life even though they are effective and literally saving people lives. and to me that just seems selfish, you don’t want to change your lifestyle for a few months in order to stop people from dying.</p>

        <p>this is what i don’t understand about this sub, you claim people like me are brain dead for believing the media but yet when i give you evidence you claim it’s fake and media propaganda and then make up your own scenario with no facts or a shred of evidence and believe them to be real, and expect everyone to believe you. so don’t call me naive when i base my opinions on science when you just go alone with what ever conspiracy you read that day. </p>
<p>it doesn’t matter what i say or give you evidence on, if it is something you don’t believe you will just instantly disregard it as fake and call me a sheep. if you actually gave me any facts that what you’re saying is true then please send them over, but just stating that the government is covering up numbers and are trying to control us with no evidence is absurd.</p>

        <p>if you read the article then it says there has been no cases in the last 7 weeks. which is due to lockdown, the new flu jab, limited international travel and just generally people being more cautious. </p>
<p>people on average get 3 cold each year, how many have you had? i’ve had none. this is because of social distancing, not being in the office, washing hands more frequently etc now you can’t say that is fake and false numbers because its real, i honestly don’t know anyone who has had a cold the past year</p>
