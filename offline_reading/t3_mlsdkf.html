        <p>My dad survived Covid. And the brain disease he is left with is otherwise known as PTSD. His memories are taunted with being admitted to his local hospital, put on a ventilator, tethered(tied up) by his ankles and wrists to his hospital bed, in an unknown room all alone, without a familiar face to reassure him of where he was or to act as his medical advocate, for 20+ days. This happened early in the pandemic, April 2020, so the the experts were telling the hospitals to vent Covid patients. We now know better. But It was also the government who made it so he was in an isolated room without a family member for so long. It was the government mandates that made the medical team scared, misinformed and confused, making it so they ignored my dad crying for help from his hospital bed. The hospital wasnâ€™t overran with Covid patients. My dad was 1 of the 2 folks in the ICU with Covid. He was the first one in his county to have been infected. The nurses and doctors simply had no idea what to do, other than lock him in a room, close the door and come in when they could gear up and down accordingly. It was the government mandates and the State of TX that left my Dad there lying in the hospital waiting for FDA approval on some version of a treatment. It was government mandates that made it impossible to get access to past Covid patients plasma for my dad. It was the fear from the government that made it take almost a week for us to convince a nurse to simply hold his bed phone up to his ear so he could hear a loved ones voice. I could keep listing all the ways the government made a nightmare situation even worse, but I will spare you. Point is, the virus isnâ€™t what fucked with my dadâ€™s brain. Itâ€™s the trauma from the many ways the overstep of our government impeded on his humanity that really fucked with his brain.</p>

        <p>Don't waste your time reading it. They are calling anxiety and mood swings a 'brain disease.' This only confirms that long-haulers are suffering from hypochondriac psychosomatic conditions. This also confirms that CNN is just USSR-level agitprop.</p>
