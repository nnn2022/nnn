    <strong>Centralization is what got us into. Decentralization seems the only way out of this mess. Humans need to start to think local, and prepare for the upcoming disruptions.</strong>
    <p><p>We need to decentralize:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Healthcare. Convid19 has shown that 3 bought WHO guys can tell doctors in the world there is a pandemic of an invented disease caused by a pathogen that wasn't even isolated. This top-down healthcare system, with corrupted experts at the top writing for us the overarching "truth" and influencing national guidelines everywhere, which everyone below in the system needs to follow, dumbs down the whole medical society. There is no more room for generating own evidence, insights, valididating theories, and trying out different solutions. Some professionals still can think independently, but the system does not allow them to voice their opinion. The peer-review medical journal system is tightly controlled, corrupt. Papers that will question the agenda narratives, get frustrated or blocked altogether in the main journals, if you control 10-20 editors of major journals, you're pretty much in control of the medical/scientific truth. We are being held in a cage, because we have built a system that works like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Food supply. An ever more centralized food supply chain has made mankind very vulnerable to any kind of (deliberate) system shock. If you hadn't noticed, the world is facing a growing list of food supply chain disruptions, brewing into an unprecendented nightmare scenario, if somewhere another chain breaks. It's looking pretty grim on the short to medium term atm. We need to stop being dependent on mega-corporations for our food production (incl. seeds) and distribution. Meat shortages will be created, they tested this briefly during covid, and the push for artificial GMO meat will grow. Meat and livestock will be further demonized. A humanity that does not get proper proteins anymore, will be weak. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>General supply chain. The Suez shock made it clear we are overly dependent on vulnerable supply routes, and a single boating accident can leave whole continents without supplies for months. We have created a system where if only one single chain breaks, it can mean the end of it. We need redundancy in the system. This means decentralization, having alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Energy/electricity. As overlord Schwab is predicting, they upcoming cyberpandemic will make Covid19 look like a minor nuisance. We see the script playing out already, with relatively minor attacks on oil and energy suppliers. This is just the prelude. These are the warnings they give us. Like MERS/SARS hoaxes were early predictions/rehearsals of Covid19, the blackouts will hit us hard. My guess we might actually have a Dark Winter, as Biden said. Literally.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ALL of the modern issues we face, are related to issues of centralization of power and infrastructure. Decentralization is key to get rid of these. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need less federal government, we need local decision making, taking into account all the local needs and local assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need less big NGO's/UN-related NGO's telling what to do, we need room for critical thinking, in all areas. We have countless millions of people that are smart and can reason, and weigh benefits and risks, these need to have a voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to decentralize the food supply chain. If all your tomatoes come from Spain, your potatoes from Holland, and the borders are suddenly closed (a surprise lockdown, pAnDeMiC!), where will your food come from? What will you eat when the supermarket is empty? Buy local, eat seasonal foods. Like the old days, prepare jars of pickled food/jams/fruits etc for in the winter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need people to pick up farming again, in any scale, small or large. Anyone who knows how to grow food is a value addition for humanity. We need local systems that are centered around protecting the food supply chain, including those building/servicing farming machinery, seed production, and distribution. We need humans to cooperate in new economic models for this, again, decentralized, with new currency methods or even bartering/trading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need people to prepare in general, for disruptions. Not full-scale SHTF scenario style, but at least build buffers in your life, so that you are not in immediate risk if short-term incidents happen. Think about a scenario what you will do when electricity/gas is suddenly shut off in the middle of a cold winter like the last. How are you going to keep your family warm? I bought a gas generator and heat blower for this scenario myself. Have a supply of keepable food stuffs, rice, water, sugar, etc so that in a real bad scenario, you can survive a full month. Think about what this would mean. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We need need a different mindset to survive what is coming to us, and to be less affected by the Beast System that is creeping up on all sides. The only solution is local. Start preparing, start farming, even on your balcony. Be a producer, not only a consumer. And get get to know your neighbour, your block, they may your biggest friends in the future. Buy a piece of land, to farm on. Buy a generator. Be more independent. As we humans used to be in the past.</p>
<p>God bless you all, let's hope it won't be as bad as I think it will, but at least be prepared for when it does happen. Change your mindset. Do add more suggestions below if you want to add!</p></p>
