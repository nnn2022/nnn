    <strong>i'm looking for a recent article about testing for cv19 particles in the air</strong>
    <p><p>i think the tests were done in london subways?? the tests proved that there were NO transmittable particles found on surfaces or in the air. the tests had been done over several months, maybe a whole year? it was pretty revealing statistics, and the article came from a mainstream news outlet. the article was published and posted last week. not sure if it was in this sub. if anyone has the link i'd appreciate it!! kicking myself for not saving it</p></p>

        <p>Covid 19 was listed everywhere, CDC, WHO, as being a droplet precaution, from March 2020, until literally right before the election in November. Then, right before the election, Nancy Palosi says on live tv that it’s airborne and Poof! Suddenly everyone is saing it’s airborne precaution. It’s total bunk.</p>
