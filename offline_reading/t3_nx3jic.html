    <strong>The adverse side effects of the covid MRNA vaccine are playing out....</strong>
    <p><p>Let me be the first to say that I am not getting this experimental mRNA vaccine. I have been vehemently against it since the beginning and it's been 6 months since people have been getting the vaccine in my province. Approximately 63% of the population has been vaccinated in my province. Only 10% of that has received the second vaccine dose. </p>
<p>I have been going to my massage therapist for the past 5 years. Here in Ontario massage therapistss go to a specific college and it's fairly rigorous to get certified. They have the capabilities to know when someone may be experiencing blood clots and send them to a hospital if they suspect so, as opposed to treating them and exasperating a problem (blood clot moving to brain for example). </p>
<p>She has told me that 50% of her client base are people suffering from some sort of side effect from the MRNA vaccine. Whether that be tingling in the arms, numbness, neurological issues, and etc. She's had three patients that have had brain aneurysms and needed stints. </p>
<p>I know one person that has side effects from the vaccine, fairly minor though, soreness of the arm and tingling.</p>
<p>I have another friend who works in a fairly big government organization and he's told me that they have multiple people who have been out for weeks due to the vaccine. One person in particular has not returned to work.</p>
<p>My friend that works at Costco mentioned how they were giving out the astrozeneca vaccine for free. Many people were getting vaccinated and many of them were feeling down for days if not for a week. Costco then instituted a policy that if you're going to get a vaccinated they will give you a few days off after.</p>
<p>I was just curious if other people could share their anecdotal stories of people they know, even themselves, who are experiencing side effects from any of the covid vaccines. </p>
<p>I pray for anyone that is experiencing any side effect or has been vaccinated with any of these covid vaccines.
We honestly don't know the repercussions of being vaccinated with the MRNA vaccines. Everyone that's been vaccinated up to this point is part of the third round of clinical trials. </p>
<p>I honestly wish the best for every human being on this planet. I'm Sending love and light to each one of you</p></p>

        <p>Except one person who only had arm soreness, the 4 people I know that got the vaccine had severe side effects that required hospitalization. But if I said that in any other sub, I’d get called a liar and a conspiracy theorist.</p>

        <p>Hope she warns people. I'm an isolated person [disabled] but I know 6-7 people who got messed up from the vaxx now, more if you include the severe flu symptoms people. "Word on the street" has to be spreading. She's got to be watching all this with horror.</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing the anectodes. Sending love to a kindered spirit. Stay strong. It is sad to see so many are getting the shots only because they want to travel or feeling pressure from friends and family or  due to coercion from employers. There needs to be a reckoning.</p>

        <p>Coercion from employer here.  I’ve been vaxed since January and waiting for the axe to fall.  Felt terribly ill after my second shot but now I’m worried about long-term effects of this thing.  I’m sorry I caved to the pressure.</p>

        <p>Out of all the people I know who have had it, I honestly don't know one who didn't suffer from any side-effects at all. To be fair the majority of people say it was just like the flu, I couldn't get out of bed for two days, I was dizzy/nauseous etc. But this is exactly the same as they would have felt were they to get covid.</p>
<p>I only have one friend who was hospitalised by it. Previously healthy 22 y/o, got a pulmonary embolism and was intensive care for 3 days followed by a week on a ward. She's now on blood thinners as a result - possibly will have to be for life. The doctors said it could be caused by the vax, could not, we don't really know. Hard not to see the connection though.</p>

        <p>My grandma had a stroke two weeks after vaccine... also in my small town I read in local paper that a women of 48 years old.had a heart attack and died a few days after 2nd shot. Her relatives stated in paper that they were now skeptical of vaccine... I also met a lady fishing that said she had swollen lymphnods for two months and was paralyzed on her left side of body.</p>

        <p>These are just anecdotes but we are seeing the same trend here, My hubs works for a major financial institution and <strong><em>they are giving people a week off after vaccination</em></strong>. made a post about this but <em>the client I work for has seen</em> <strong><em>9 deaths</em></strong> <em>since February this year</em> (not including on the line of duty deaths and suicides) we saw <strong>7 suicides last year :(</strong>  but of the 9 that have died since January/feburary, all but 1 were black female in their middle ages working HR/ secretary type jobs</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: no one died at my office (60k) last year due to covid, yes 7 men died from suicides and there are a ton of line-of-duty deaths. <strong>BUT we had ZERO CV deaths in 2020.</strong></p>

        <p>Most of my co-workers had it and they joked in a zoom meeting about being sleepy with sore arms or with flu symptoms for a day or two then were fine. One older woman at work, about 62, told me in private she regrets getting it because she had a bad headache for a week. That's about it, as far as I know, no one has been out of work long term or died but everyone is Working From Home. There has been more turn over in staff recently and I don't know the stories but I expect I'dhear rumors if someone died. There are about 500 people in the campus I work out of when not home.</p>

        <p>I just had a cousin die, it was 3 months after his vax—he was hospitalized for “Covid” a month after his second, then after being transferred to two other hospitals two states away, he passed almost 3 months to the day. His family(close) that are still in shock from the beginning aren’t putting the pieces together, but we are trying to plant those seeds so it can be reported- we keep asking why’d he even get Covid after getting the shot...
Also my best friends mother was found unresponsive in the shower the morning after her second Pfizer shot-was in icu for about two weeks, and now still recovering and no answers.</p>
