        <p>How can you be sure you aren’t sick and eliminate the chance of being asymptomatic. And wouldn’t that be akin to “I don’t have an std so I won’t wear a condom”.</p>

        <p>I'm not sick because I don't feel sick, nor am I doing anything like coughing, sneezing, or running a fever. If I am asymptomatic, then there is still no need for me to act like a sick person.</p>
<p>No, that would not be the same. A better analogy would be "never have sex because you might get an STD." I take REASONABLE precautions to keep myself healthy, including exercise, sleeping enough, eating well, and washing my hands. I will not cover my mouth and nose at all times because I might get sick.</p>

        <p>A person who is asymptomatic is still sick. That’s the issue, I understand not wanting to wear masks because you won’t give it to someone, but unless you test daily (which no one could reasonably do) you can’t rule out being asymptomatic. It is a good analogy because people with STDs might not show symptoms. And a condom (or in this case a mask) is a reasonable precaution.</p>

        <p>Even Fouci admits that this disease is not being spread by asymptomatic carriers. That is not the driver of the spread this disease. Asymptomatic spread, is an extremely rare occurrence, since someone who shows zero symptoms is unlikely to be able to give a stranger enough viral load to cause an infection. What seems to be forgotten is that human beings are born with an immune system and other forms of protection (skin, hair, eyelids, mucus, etc) that helps protect people from getting infections. In order to actually get sick from Sars-Cov-2, you need to get enough of the virus to get passed all of the body's defense systems. This usually requires the "sick" person to cough or sneeze right into the face of another person. But someone coughing is not asymptomatic. Thats the number 1 symptom. There is the strange misconception that 1 single coronavirus cell touching a human being, will automatically result in getting violently sick. That just isn't the case. It is generally accepted that this disease primarily spreads due to extended exposure in confined locations (like pretty much every other respiratory virus, including other coronaviruses). If covid was spreading at grocery stores or restaurants, you would see walmart employees and servers being disproportionately affected by this disease. This simply is not the case. "Essential workers" have  been working through all of this since March, and months with no masks, yet large Walmart or Amazon outbreaks never happened. When you look at the data, covid has basically ripped through nursing homes. Forcing people with no symptoms to wear masks because of the rare possibility that they might be unknowingly contagious as an asymptomatic carrier of the disease, and they might somehow (without coughing or sneezing) give someone else enough of a viral load that it gets passed this stranger's immune system, so that they get sick enough to require hospitalization or even death, is beyond ridiculous. It defies common sense.</p>

        <p>No, a mask is not a reasonable precaution. Condoms are used for what, maybe 30 minutes at most? And it's your right to not wear one. No government agency is forcing you to. With masks, there is the potential to not be allowed to participate in society without one. People have the right to not wear condoms if they don't want to. That's between the people involved to negotiate between each other. I'm not getting a choice in whether I want to wear a mask; it's being forced.</p>
<p>And before you ask: no, I don't care about the potential of getting someone else sick. I really don't feel guilty. It's not my job to ensure the health of the entire population. I am selfish. I want to live my life. I'm done caring about everyone else.</p>

        <p>Let's not sink to the level of the brigadiers...  even if they're here to do nothing but stir the pot, at least their comments seem to be attempting to foster conversation and sharing sources, instead of just slinging insults left and right like others have been doing recently. Your post reminded me eerily of when I went to coronavirus to honestly try to have a conversation/see their side. It's becoming far too easy to get polarized - this sub always had a fairly welcoming atmosphere, and I'd hate for it to lose that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yes, OP has clearly made very disparaging comments about this reddit before, but insults or assumptions are just gonna solidify whatever bad reputation they believe about us here.</p>
<p>OP, thank you for being civil, and I'll make a comment in a moment expanding on my view as to why I don't believe people are entitled for not wanting mask mandates, and I'd love to discuss it further with you.</p>

        <p>First I wanna say thanks for asking a question rather than name calling as others might. I personally think they are effective because of studies on masks, but also having had schools open up and require masks. I haven’t heard of any cases at any nearby schools nor any at mine. Before they opened and kids started wearing masks people just hung out and didn’t wear masks around friends. I know of a few others that have gotten it even without going into crowded areas by not wearing masks. Also here’s a study from Texas University. Texas A&amp;M University. "Face masks critical in preventing spread of COVID-19: Study found that wearing a face mask stopped person-to-person spread of the virus." ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 12 June 2020. I’m not saying that this will prevent getting it. (People still touch stuff and all). But I feel if me wearing a mask might help at all I should. If not for me then for the teachers with immunodeficiencies.</p>

        <p>Here's my problem with this. On one hand, you are basing your opinion on anecdotal evidence. Which I'm sure you see the issue with that. The other problem is that you are relying on limited studies. Now, studies are fine and good. And it's understandable that many of the mask mandates that were implemented early on were based on the conclusions of many of these studies. But the problem I have with this is two fold. </p>
<p>1) You can find plenty of studies on both sides of the argument. <a href="https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy">Here</a> is an article that lists multiple studies showing that masks don't work. And there are many more studies out there that make the same conclusions. I don't share this as conclusive proof of masks not being effective. I share it just to emphasize the fact that there is no scientific consensus on the subject. So for every study that says that masks work, there is a study that shows that they don't. </p>
<p>2) More importantly, while basing policies on these kinds of studies made some sense back in the spring, since there was no real data out there to look at about the effectiveness of masks, it makes very little sense now. At this point we have plenty of real data from countless places around the worlc have have had mandates masks for months. Let's look at a few examples.</p>
<p>California issued a statewide mask mandate on <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/06/18/880583357/california-gov-newsom-makes-face-masks-mandatory-amid-rising-coronavirus-cases">June 18</a>. And some places like Los Angeles County had mask mandates in effect since <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/05/l-a-county-coronavirus-update-public-health-director-says-masks-are-in-fact-mandatory-across-the-entire-county-1202935226/">May 14.</a> So you would think that cases would slow down in California, but that's not what happened. <a href="https://imgur.com/dZVhEwi">Here</a> is the daily new cases chart from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/usa/california/">worldometers</a>. It clearly shows that mask mandates have not led to a slow in the spread of the virus. In fact, the opposite happened. As masks were mandated, cases began to rise at a more rapid rate. After the statewide mandate, cases dramatically increased for over a month until it peaked on July 25th. If masks were effective, you would expect at the least a flattening of the curve. But this did not happen. What is also interesting is that Los Angeles County accounts for nearly half of all of California's <a href="https://imgur.com/ky2V0gh">deaths</a>, and they have had a mask mandate in place since mid May. And this <a href="https://imgur.com/PNjQIHP">map</a> from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/17/upshot/coronavirus-face-mask-map.html">New York Times</a> shows that California, and the LA area are very compliant when it comes to mask wearing. Mask wearing has not been effective in California.</p>
<p>The same thing happened in Florida. While there is no statewide mask mandate, most of the largest cities in the state (Miami, Tampa, Orlando) implemented mask mandates by <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/06/19/major-florida-cities-now-require-use-of-face-mask-in-public-places/">June 19th.</a> Yet after the mandates, cases continued to rise for nearly a month, finally peaking on <a href="https://imgur.com/48pabWz">July 13.</a> And in similar fashion, the curve wasn't flattened at all, on the contrary, the rate of new cases increased after mask mandates were implemented. Mask wearing has not been effective in Florida.</p>
<p>Texas has a similar story. While a statewide mask mandate was issued on July 3rd, the largest cities (<a href="https://patch.com/texas/irving-tx/dallas-county-judge-issues-order-requiring-face-masks">Dallas</a>, <a href="https://houstonse.org/blog/harris-county-new-mask-order/">Houston</a>, <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=342433">Austin</a>, <a href="https://www.bexar.org/3234/COVID-19">San Antonio</a>) all implemented mask mandates around June 22. Yet after this mandate, cases continued to increase regardless, finally peaking almost a month later on <a href="https://imgur.com/qUuLpYw">July 16</a>. Mask wearing has not been effective in Texas.</p>
<p>Even look at <a href="http://imgur.com/a/7Jcmo6j">New York</a>. New York's cases peaked on April 10th, but their mask mandate didn't go into effect until April 17th. New York's cases peaked and declined without the help of people wearing masks. If masks did have an impact, the data should reflect that, and the case trajectory should have changed showing an decrease in the rate of new cases. But this is not what happened. Cases declined, and continued declining at the same rate. Masks made no difference. </p>
<p>The same thing can be said for Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington, and Virginia. All of these places implemented mask mandates, yet cases continued to increase regardless. And this is not just an American thing. The same thing has been observed around the world. Spain, France, Belgium, Peru, The Philippines, Argentina, and countless other nations implemented strict mask mandates, only to have cases to continue to increase. And then you have places like Scandinavia, which didn't impose masks at all, yet had similar results (Sweden) or better (Denmark, Norway, Finland). When you compare <a href="http://imgur.com/a/TAhbmWd">Sweden</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/dKeWa4B">Michigan </a>,  two places with around 10 Million people and 1 major metro area, you'll see that they both peaked and declined. The difference is Sweden didn't lock down or mandate masks. Michigan mandated masks on June 18 and had a strict lock down. But after Michigan imposed its mask mandate, cases continued to steadily increase for the next 2 months. Michigan also ended up with a thousand more deaths and many more total cases. </p>
<p>The data is overwhelming that mask wearing does not slow the spread of covid. Nearly every place where it has been tried has not resulted in reduced case numbers or even a flattened trajectory. So generally when I ask mask advocates why they believe that people should wear masks, they always end up pointing me to some limited studies. But like I said earlier, the studies are all over the places and there is in no way a consensus. But at this point we don't need to solely rely on limited studies, we have real world data from real places where people have actually been wearing masks in public for months with relatively high levels of compliance (pretty much every store in America requires a mask to enter), and the data just does not support the idea that masks are effective at slowing the spread of this virus.</p>

        <p>I do see the flaw in anecdotal evidence. It really is difficult having evidence for both sides. I will reply again later once I’ve had a chance to look through all of this. And again thanks for being civil!</p>

        <p>I must say, I am surprised.  I came over here to see what leaps of logic and mental acrobatics would be going on, while constant name calling was the game being played.  I still disagree with a lot of the people who think masks do nothing, but I always prefer a good open debate, which has been rare as of late.</p>

<p>I'm pleasantly surprised, or perhaps I have missed some on here, but good job, reddit.</p>
