<p>For the people that do not want to read 20 pages (it's only 20, come on). You can read this small one instead.</p>

<p>Early on in the stages of the pandemic, federal law had a specific guideline that regulated how infections and disease were counted. When covid began - these laws were changed.<br>
Before, cases needed to be confirmed with a test, deaths needed to be labeled as the singular cause and not a contributing factor for infectious disease.<br>
The changes to the law now stated that:<br>
• Cases can be confirmed without a test<br>
• PCR tests, which whatever used to diagnose disease before, as well as the inventor saying that it is incapable of a diagnosis, were used<br>
• If a clear alternative cause for death was available it would still be labeled a covid death<br>
Now in 2021 as of July, the CDC has now admitted what we do to be true: the tests are inaccurate and they can ring positive for the common cold.

This legal medical journal compared what covid case counts and death counts would look like if they had stuck to their previous legal medical methods and compared it to their new methods which they did extra judicially which violated federal law. </p>

<p>Here is the findings from the source.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deaths are about 1600% higher with the new regulations of how to count deaths (2020) than the old ones (2003)</li>
<li>Out of the 700.043 that got diagosed with covid, 678.720 recovered.</li>
<li>Recovery rate in the ages of 0-49 were almost 100%</li>
<li>Recovery rate in the ages of 50-69 were about 98%</li>
<li>Recovery rate in the ages of 70+ were about 75%</li>
