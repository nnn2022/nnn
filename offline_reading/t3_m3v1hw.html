        <p>They can't make a rule in their business that breaks people's rights, so they have no right to force you to wear something against your will just to go there. People ask how this is different from a gay wedding cake. That's because the baker was just telling them what he wouldn't make. They could have had any other cake, and even a wedding cake, it's just that the baker wouldn't put two men on top. It wasn't because they were gay. It would be no different if I asked for a 100 tier cake and he would say he can't make it. A business can decide what they do and do not provide, but they can't turn people away because they're not dressed the way they want them to be.</p>

        <p>Mask wearing is NOT a sign of bowing to authoritarianism you fucking nitwit. It's the first major pandemic in 100 yrs and while many have been lucky enough to not contract the virus or only have mild cases there are hundreds of thousands dead and many more with long hauler symptoms that may be permanent.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking you're smart or edgy for not wearing masks and downplaying covid, maybe spend a little if that energy on learning what authoritarianism actually is, how it plays out and how the right wing in this country and around the world is trying to achieve their ends. You might be surprised with what you find.</p>

<p>Nope. Trespassing is a charge all it's own.</p>
<p>&rt; You must first have to have broken a law to be trespassed from a public accommodation. </p>
<p>Factually wrong. The only thing public accommodations are help to are discrimination as is typical. You're referencing civil rights laws. Nothing else is protected. They can mandate people to wear shirts, shoes, etc.</p>
<p>Trespassing, under every definition, includes not leaving when asked to by the authority of the private property you are on.</p>
<p>Here, <a href="https://www.goldsteinhilley.com/property-crimes/criminal-trespass/">feel free to learn about trespassing laws in Texas even</a></p>

        <p>Yep. You must have done something wrong to be trespassed. Trespassing someone without due cause would be grounds for discrimination.</p>
<p>Factually, not wrong. I am referencing the definition of business who opens its doors to the public. Yes, the civil rights act applies to public accommodations, but it’s an independent legal definition. They can require people to wear shirts, shoes, etc because these are reasonable requirements for <em>public places.</em> Enforcing a medical device is not a reasonable requirement and is not backed by any sort of precedent. Shirts and shoes are not medical devices, they are public standards of dress which <em>most</em> people agree on. Masks are not such a thing.</p>
<p>Business owners are not an <em>authority.</em> They have no authority over me <em>unless I break a law.</em> Same with law enforcement, I must break a law (commit a <em>crime</em>) before an officer can detain me.</p>
<p>You can’t ask me to leave a business for any old reason. That’s discrimination. Welcome to the law. </p>
<p>Let you know where my house is..? Really resorting to such drama? Come on. I’m dumb? Dumb is using character attacks during a civil discourse. It serves no purpose other than show the level of depravity you’re willing to stoop too. It’s rather embarrassing to read. Here you are, pretending to be intelligent with a good read on your arguments, then you go tossing insults like a child. What a shame. Cheers.</p>

        <p>&rt; You must have done something wrong to be trespassed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goldsteinhilley.com/property-crimes/criminal-trespass/">Again, trespassing is a crime. Feel free to read the laws yourself if you want to keep pretending it's not</a></p>
<p>&rt; Trespassing someone without due cause</p>
<p>I got to laugh at you using the word like this. Trespassing is what the <em>trespasser</em> does. You don't "trespass" someone. It's not something a person does to another. It's something someone does. That's a nonsensical statement and makes me question your grasp of the English language, let alone the word trespassing itself.</p>
<p>&rt; They can require people to wear shirts, shoes, etc because these are reasonable requirements for public places.</p>
<p>Businesses that open their place to the public are not public places. They are private property that they let you enter and can revoke it if you do not follow their rules. That can include any situation where they feel you are imposing a threat to their other customers, like not wearing a mask during a pandemic.</p>
<p>At that point, should you choose to not leave when asked to, you are trespassing and committing a crime.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goldsteinhilley.com/property-crimes/criminal-trespass/">Again, it's all very well documented how the laws work.</a></p>
<p>&rt; Business owners are not an authority. They have no authority over me unless I break a law. </p>
<p>Yeah, they do. Just like you can kick someone out of your house, and if they refuse, it becomes breaking the law via trespassing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goldsteinhilley.com/property-crimes/criminal-trespass/">Which again... is a crime.</a></p>
<p>&rt; You can’t ask me to leave a business for any old reason. That’s discrimination.</p>
<p>No, it's not. You can ask someone to leave for not wearing shoes, for example. It's private property. They get to say what goes. It only breaks discrimination laws when it's based on a protected class. Do you know what a protected class is? Obviously not. </p>
<p>In reality, they can throw you out for basically any reason that isn't protected by laws like the 14th amendment (aka, protected classes and such). Your only actual way to go against this is to not do business here and force them to reconsider. It's all about the free market at that point to push them to change policies (not that you have the logic or level of support to ever do anything about it here)</p>
<p>&rt; Dumb is using character attacks during a civil discourse.</p>
<p>So basically you can't refute that you'd assert the opposite logic when it came to your own household.</p>

<p>It <strong>literally</strong> isn't. A public place is something government owned. That's <strong>literally</strong> why it's public. A business is something owned by private citizens. That makes it private property.</p>
<p>Let's also make this abundantly clear.</p>
<p>Even if it was. <em>It still doesn't matter.</em> You know you can trespass in a school yeah?</p>
<p>Yes, for some private property, there are laws set out to limit the ability to create trespassing situations. But those need to be explicitly called out in law. Same in reverse for public property like schools not being unlimited access to the public.</p>
<p>It's private property. If your access to it is revoked for any reason and you refuse to leave. That is trespassing.</p>
<p>It's just a fact of the law.</p>

        <p>In this particular case the woman is at the bank where she more than likely has an account. If this is true the judge is going to have to look at what warranted the trespassing charge. </p>
<p>In this instance it looks like the trespassing charge will be dropped but a disobeying a lawful order (the officer requesting her to leave) will be applied since she had good reason to be there. They might explore resisting arrest but with a good lawyer that will most likely be dropped. Community service or a small fine might be the end result if she agrees to a plea deal. Doubt it though since she has the fact that the mandate was lifted on her side. </p>
<p>For that very reason it will be difficult to pursue serious charges. There's a good chance it maybe dropped altogether for that very reason, again, if she gets a good lawyer.</p>
<p>If she suffers any injuries, physical or emotional, from the arrest then further down the road she might be able to hold the bank and the officer liable in civil court.</p>

        <p>If she owns an account she has the right to be there. You do realize judges examine ALL aspects of the situation to make a judgement, right?</p>
<p>What you're confusing is the fact that people can be arrested with trespassing whether they're guilty of it or not. Whether it will hold up in court is a whole other thing. I'm not arguing with her arrest, but being arrested doesn't mean you're guilty of the crime you're accused of. Most people arrested for not wearing a mask have the charges completely dropped FYI. There is no law requiring people to wear mask which leaves nothing to charge them with, other than resisting arrest, disobeying a lawful order or assault. I only see one that could be applied but even that might not get her convicted.</p>

<p>Because companies are more interested in sending the message that they're not welcome without a mask than they care about following up on pressing charges.</p>

<p>Lot of projection going on. Comparing not wearing a mask to not wearing clothes is silly since wearing clothes has been the socially acceptable norm for upwards of 98% of the population for over a millinia. Mask? Not so much and has to be mandated just to get the majority of public to comply. Most people prefer to be fully clothed and would be extremely uncomfortable being in the nude.</p>
<p>"They are not in the first place"</p>
<p>If she was denied service then yes they barred her from accessing her account. If she wasn't then that would be evident by her leaving with her money without incident.</p>
<p>Refusing to proceed with the charges is very damming. The court doesn't go off of feelings only the laws on the books. Masks are considered medical equipment and no corporation can force it's customers to wear one no matter how many scary signs they post in their establishment. If someone openly breaks the law, which you're asserting the lady has done, then they will proceed with prosecution to the full extent of the law. If it was my feelings that I was going off, of then you would be able to point to multiple convictions that resulted. There aren't any. That's a problem...at least for you.....</p>

<p>If it was the truth then there would be convictions to point to. Yelling? Copy and paste my responses that indicate I'm emotional. You're demonstrating the behavior you've accused me of. I haven't insulted you or conveyed a snarky tone in any of my responses.</p>

<p>No, you stopped there because that is the only part of my statement that supports your argument. The other part is crucial to my point which you conveniently left out.</p>
<p>"No, they didn't. There is no requirement for her to be in that building to access her account. Next?"</p>
<p>Are you sure? There have been many times people have had to go in person to address an issue with their account. The exact reason why will be addressed by the court. As of now it's all speculation and conjecture as far as we're concerned.</p>
<p>"It means they don't care enough to put them in jail over it. They don't care about punishment, they care about the actual safety of the people"</p>
<p>She went to jail already. If they don't care about punishment why call the police at all? This is you confusing being arrested and accused of a crime and going to jail vs being convicted of a crime and serving a sentence. If they actually cared about safety they wouldn't have risked the arresting officer getting infected from a supposedly deadly virus.</p>
<p>"Nope. A victimized party deciding to not press charges is 100% enough for them to do nothing. This isn't debatable. It's just a fact."  </p>
<p>That's true for anyone pressing charges however for that to be the final outcome repeatedly shows this is purely about control. Trespassing in most cases where there's actually criminal activity almost always results in prosecution.</p>

        <p>I get that businesses get to decide who they do business with and under which terms, but I feel like a bank is kind of a special case. THEY actually have HER money in there. For the free market argument to work, she has to be able to take her business elsewhere, which I’m pretty sure she’d be more than happy to do at this point. If they’d let her. </p>
<p>If they refuse her to get HER money back, there had better be some clause in the terms and conditions stating that she only has the right to retrieve HER money and close HER account, UNLESS there is a virus making the rounds or something like that. </p>
<p>I doubt that there is. Though I could be wrong.</p>

        <p>I think you’re missing my point. If wearing a mask was a condition to get her money back, that should have been specified at the start of their contract. You can’t just make new terms up as you go. 
’Sure, of course you can get your money back... but only if you get a face tattoo first! Yep sorry, new company policy’. </p>
<p>Doesn’t work like that.</p>

        <p>I kinda agree with what you're saying but at the same time, imagine if instead of not wearing a mask she was completely topless or wearing something absurd like a giant tire around her waist, or a shiny noisemaking butt plug that extends outside of her pants and can be seen and heard by everyone.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be unreasonable to reject her service at that point despite the contract not stating you can't have your boobs out or have that other stuff while closing your account.</p>
<p>The way you wrote it makes it seem like it's an absolute rule that you will be allowed to do x as you abide by the contract but if I make it more extreme it becomes clear that it is not absolute rule. Plus she can also do all of that outside of the store itself.</p>

        <p>I get what you’re saying, but we’re not talking about some her showing up in anything extreme or even out of the ordinary. It’s not her that changed the the terms - it’s the bank that has made a quite radical change in what they consider to be ’proper attire’. Without asking the customer, and then apparently refusing any kind of service if they don’t comply. </p>
<p>I feel like they at the very least should have given her the chance to decide if she was okay with the change, and if not, the chance to take her business elsewhere.</p>

        <p>All those Karens were probably screaming defund the police back last summer! Now they're advocating the same tyrannical powers that they were once fighting against. Wokism strikes again with its contradictory values. They only expect the police to enforce certain "rules" when it suits.</p>
<p>It's evident at this point that what happened in that bank wasn't about saving life. For if it was, it would have been safer to leave the woman alone to continue on her day. It would have been quicker and nobody would have needed to come into contact with her.</p>

        <p>The woman did technically break the law by refusing to leave the business. It is technically the business' right to refuse service. I think it's insane, and I hate the fact that this is the paradigm we've created, where businesses can refuse service to someone for not wearing a mask, but here we are. I support this woman, but I understand where the officer is coming from, too. I think for us to make a change in regards to mask-wearing, we have to approach it differently, and not belligerently. If I walk into a store that tells me to put a mask on, I say "no thanks," and politely leave.</p>

        <p>As long as the bank is a private business they can deny service to anyone that isn't following the guidelines of that same private business. And <em>even If you were right</em> mask aren't technically listed as medical devices and neither are them "illegal" . Oh and you're right on the <em>banks cannot keep someone from their money</em> but there are many other ways for someone to get to their money</p>

        <p>Please read my comment again. Any business which opens its doors to the public becomes a public accommodation. Thus, people have protections under the civil rights act and the ADA. None of that really matters though, since <em>a business cannot enforce a medical device as its policy, because that would be practicing medicine without a license.</em></p>
<p>If someone who is scared of a virus would like to do curbside for their cash, the bank is surely able to to offer them that courtesy. Why are they discriminating against people who can’t wear masks instead of people who choose to? It’s totally backwards.</p>

        <p>A business that is not government owned is a <em>private business</em> that can enforce their own rules in their own propriety. Even if that business is open to the public, fuckin' McDonald's is open to everyone but you need a mask to enter. And for the love of christ enforcing mask wearing is NOT "practicing medicine without a license" and if you don't want to go to that specific bank because "masks violate my rights" Go to a goddamn atm</p>

        <p>She was ignoring the protocols of the business, was asked to leave, was further told to leave by a police/security officer and didn't. </p>
<p>I do not for a second believe that if the woman was wearing a mask, but was also dressed in only her underwear, you wouldn't be okay with what transpired.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure what her underwear has to do with any of it. She had business to conduct and had not broken any law. There was no reason for the business to discriminate against her. Someone refusing to adhere to an unlawful policy is not a valid reason to refuse service. She will unfortunately have to sue both the business and the police department now, but she will be rewarded handsomely if she does.</p>
