    <strong>Can I ask some questions? Please don't hate me lol.</strong>
    <p><p>So I just found this sub because of a cross post on another sub and I figured this is a good a place as any to ask questions because I'm super curious about the mindset of communities like this, I haven't run into anyone in real life yet and even if I did its such a touchy subject that I wouldn't even want to get into it lol. Before I continue I figure I should say that my political beliefs are probably the complete opposite of everyone here and I'm not looking to be swayed to a different view point nor am I going to try to convince anyone here to see things the way I see them. Sorry if anything I ask sounds stupid or comes across as offensive, I'm just a very curious person and my only intention is to understand so I guess let's just get right into it. This is gonna be formated a bit informal because I'm on my phone and I have a lot of questions so I'm not going to get super in detail about them.</p>
<p>First question, how's your day going?</p>
<p>"You wear a seat belt, why don't you wear a mask". This is something I've heard tossed around A LOT but I've never heard a response to. This as well as things like "you listen to no shoes no service, so why don't you wear a mask". I dont exactly know what my question here is, I'd just like to finally hear a response.</p>
<p>Whats your political standing you'd say? Who did you vote for if you voted? From an outside lense this community seems very 'disconnected' from the boxes American politics and news likes to place us in, I've always got the impression that most people in communities like this are a bit centrist libertarian but sometimes not so much, maybe a little right leaning?</p>
<p>I've avoided referring to this community a name because I dont know what I should say. 'Anti maskers' is usually what comes to mind but I dont know if you guys consider that offensive or wrong like how everyone in American politics calls anyone with left wing beliefs 'communist' or 'socialist', so my question is, what would you call yourself?</p>
<p>How do you feel about police? Big corporations? What about these BLM protest and other social and political movements?</p>
<p>I've watched a couple videos around the sub and checked the comments and it seems for the most part everyone does believe the virus is real, am I correct in thinking that? If not, what do you think is happening? </p>
<p>I've got more questions but I dont know how to phrase them and I dont even know if this will go anywhere so I'll leave it here for now. Happy holidays everyone I'm looking forward to the responses.</p></p>

        <p>&rt;"You wear a seat belt, why don't you wear a mask".</p>
<p>same reason you weren't wearing a mask last year, and same reason why in 10 years you won't be wearing a mask. And before you remind me we are In ThE miDdLe Of A pAnDeMiC, people die from respiratory viruses every year and a death is not less tragic because it happened in 2019. </p>
<p>you will stop wearing a mask as soon as your social media feed tells you it's alright, and you'll go right back to "killing grandmas" without a second thought. "It's such a small inconvenience" but you will <em>not</em> put up with it for the rest of your life</p>
<p>we are no different, we just started a little earlier</p>

        <p>Dang, I'm usually embarrassed to tell anyone my political viewpoint because it is very opposite of not just this community but the modern world as a whole. I love history, when I say love I mean and know more about my history and the back of my hand. Ive found that powerful empires have one thing in common, a strong authoritative leader/leaders and when the people in charge can do what they need to do to get things done, it leads to a stronger country, a safer place to live, and better living standards for the average individual. I know in this society it is very easy for one evil bastard to ruin the whole thing for everyone but I find that rolling those dice leads to a better situation that what most of the first world finds themselves in today. I dont think any of my ideas will fix everything but I think we should takes steps away from the status quo because things aren't getting better so we need to do something.</p>
<p>I think that in the US there are too many external influences on our government and every politician is in it for himself and the money and if we were to get rid of as many of those external influences as possible. I think presidential terms should be longer, maybe 5-6 years. I think a good president should be able to run as many times they want, if you got a good thing going why change it up? I think we should curb the power many corporations as well as the media have on this country and our politicians. I think we should pull out of the middle east and cut back on military spending to focus our efforts elsewhere. </p>
<p>I could go on but I'll leave it there for now because my inbox is blowing up and I want to reply to some others.</p>

        <p>This sub feels like the restrictions put in place has brought us one step back and to return to normalcy would be one step forward. I think we need to take two steps, hell maybe five steps forward, I think if anytime is the time for change its now. I see on the news all these different groups around the US rising up demanding change but none of them have the influence they need to actually do something. Its why I'm a bit vague in my opinions and ideas, I don't know which way is the right way, but I know that if we don't start walking in another direction now we're gonna get stuck in the mud.</p>

        <p>I have zero issues with someone asking about this respectfully. I‚Äôll try to answer most your questions, but probably won‚Äôt hit all of them.
First question, my day is going alright. We got our first real snow of the season.</p>
<p>Onto the rest. Let‚Äôs talk about the seatbelt question. For starters, seatbelts were studied for years before being put into law. They‚Äôre also not required to wear outdoors. Or while shopping. Or while talking to other human beings.
Beyond that, masks are shown to be ineffective, and downright harmful to your health, both physical and mental. The average person is not wearing them properly (replacing them frequently, not touching them at ALL while wearing), and therefore we‚Äôre seeing an uptick in bacterial pneumonia. Something that Fauci actually mentioned as being a problem in the 1918 pandemic.
They also dehumanize us, which is so incredibly bad for our psyches. I worked in a preschool up until October, and I watched these toddlers, all the way up to kindergarteners, not see faces for 8+ hours a day. I can only imagine the ramifications of that during such important developmental years.</p>
<p>Virus is definitely real, and MASSIVELY overblown. H1N1 was worse, but we didn‚Äôt shut down the world for that.</p>
<p>I could go on, but I‚Äôd ramble. I‚Äôll let others pick up other questions, as well as I‚Äôm sure improve my answers.</p>

        <p>Hey /u/A_Jar_of_Fake_Vomit, I'm guessing you're not going to reply to my inquiry about why you think H1N1 was worse than Covid-19, probably because it wouldn't help carry your narrative.  </p>

        <p>&rt; Virus is definitely real, and MASSIVELY overblown. H1N1 was worse, but we didn‚Äôt shut down the world for that.</p>
<p>By what metric would you say H1N1 was worse?</p>
<p>Here's some info from the CDC about H1N1:</p>
<p><em>From April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, CDC estimated there were:</em></p>
<p><em>60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million)</em></p>
<p><em>274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719)</em></p>
<p><em>12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) in the United States due to the (H1N1)pdm09 virus.</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, CDC estimated that 151,700-575,400 people worldwide died from (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated.</em></p>

        <p>I think the argument is that for h1n1 people who were say 85 with cancer and died h1n1 positive likely weren‚Äôt even tested for it and even if they were it wasn‚Äôt counted towards the death toll.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the answer is somewhere in the middle. Covid is definitely more dangerous than the regular flu, more dangerous than h1n1, but less dangerous than the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù are showing us right now as the numbers are certainly skewed.</p>

<p>Hmm, I haven't heard that.  I usually just hear people saying "H1N1 was worse", but I have not seen specific details about why it would be considered worse.</p>
<p>Here is what the CDC says about H1N1 and age:</p>
<p>&rt;Globally, 80 percent of (H1N1)pdm09 virus-related deaths were estimated to have occurred in people younger than 65 years of age. This differs greatly from typical seasonal influenza epidemics, during which about 70 percent to 90 percent of deaths are estimated to occur in people 65 years and older.</p>
<p>&rt;Though the 2009 flu pandemic primarily affected children and young and middle-aged adults, the impact of the (H1N1)pdm09 virus on the global population during the first year was less severe than that of previous pandemics. Estimates of pandemic influenza mortality ranged from 0.03 percent of the world‚Äôs population during the 1968 H3N2 pandemic to 1 percent to 3 percent of the world‚Äôs population during the 1918 H1N1 pandemic. It is estimated that 0.001 percent to 0.007 percent of the world‚Äôs population died of respiratory complications associated with (H1N1)pdm09 virus infection during the first 12 months the virus circulated.</p>
<p>So while I'm absolutely not an expert, it sounds, to me, that Covid-19 is far <em>worse</em> than H1N1, and not the other way around.</p>

        <p>Hi. I don't hate you. I think that you are being respectful. My day has been decent, thank you. I got acupuncture and am feeling really good about finally beginning to recover after it being four months since a collision. </p>
<p>Pretending that I believe the information that authorities give us is 100% true, I don't think the rona threat is great enough to warrant the reactions--all of them. 99.(?)% of people survive and the majority don't even know they have it. The tests being used were never developed to detect any live virus, but they can pick up genetic material from several and the test can come out positive. The way that the tests are wrongly conducted increase positive results. So, the case thing is a complete sham, but it drives pseudo justification for everything that's being done to us.</p>
<p>That's the foundation for this entire fiasco, and really the basis of me thinking every restriction, mandate and technocratic imposition is bullshit.</p>
<p>Not everyone here holds the same opinions on every single layer of this stinky, wretched onion. Please consider not engaging in black and  white thinking. I can tell you are on the brink of detecting the possibility of nuances by the way you write.</p>
<p>I don't really care to answer the other questions. HA! Again, your level of respect is appreciated.</p>

        <p>&rt; You wear a seat belt, why don't you wear a mask". </p>
<p>I wear a seatbelt when I‚Äôm on the highway, I don‚Äôt when I‚Äôm on a dirt farm road going 5 mph. My response is proportionate to the risk. This virus has a 99.7% survival rate, if it had a 50% survival rate you wouldn‚Äôt need to tell me to wear a mask I‚Äôd be wearing one on my own accord -and it‚Äôd be an n99 respirator or equivalent not a cloth mask made from a t shirt someone made in their basement.</p>
<p>&rt; This as well as things like "you listen to no shoes no service, so why don't you wear a mask".</p>
<p>Personally I respect a business‚Äô right to tell me to wear a mask. I don‚Äôt believe the government should be able to tell me to or tell the business that they have to tell me to. I usually comply when asked by a business to wear a mask. I don‚Äôt comply with city orders to wear one on the street/sidewalk or outside in general.</p>
<p>&rt; Whats your political standing you'd say? Who did you vote for if you voted? From an outside lense this community seems very 'disconnected' from the boxes American politics and news likes to place us in, I've always got the impression that most people in communities like this are a bit centrist libertarian but sometimes not so much, maybe a little right leaning?</p>
<p>Centrist libertarian with right leanings is accurate for me. I begrudgingly voted for Trump despite thinking he‚Äôs an idiot - I liked some of his policies and really dislike the Democrat platform at this point. </p>
<p>&rt; so my question is, what would you call yourself?</p>
<p>Free thinkers. And back to the ‚Äúanti-mask‚Äù thing. I‚Äôm not anti mask, though some here are, I‚Äôm anti mask <em>mandate</em>. You wear one if you feel safer with it or if you have a pre-existing condition, I don‚Äôt care, but don‚Äôt tell me the government should force me to. </p>
<p>&rt; How do you feel about police?</p>
<p>They‚Äôre like any other group of people, there‚Äôs shitheads and there‚Äôs good ones. Police unions are the problem IMO that keeps the shitheads around. </p>
<p>&rt; Big corporations</p>
<p>Idk what you‚Äôre asking about big corporations?</p>
<p>&rt; What about these BLM protest and other social and political movements?</p>
<p>I think we‚Äôll stop hearing about BLM after Biden takes office despite no real changes they were asking for. And I feel that says all I need to say about BLM: it was a political show with big money backing.</p>

<p>This makes more sense to me now. Honestly I'm the same way, when driving passenger with certain friends I make sure to wear AND lock my seatbelt, with others I won't even bother because I feel safe. I live in NH and basically nobody in my town even knows anyone who's had covid and even less of them even bother wearing masks, I personally have started wearing this one I got for graduation recently just to keep my face warm in the cold lol.</p>

<p>I saw some comments here on the sub saying that the fear is being perpetuated by big corporation dollars to kill off small businesses through the lock down or something, I thought someone might have some more context on that.</p>

<p>Oh interesting question. I certainly think big corporations will benefit long term from the lockdowns. Retail space that was for a mom and pop restaurant will soon be owned by a large national chain in many cases. I don‚Äôt think they had much to do with the initial laws/orders for the lockdowns in some grand conspiracy, but I do think they‚Äôve by now realized the lockdowns are in their best interest long term and likely at least some of them are pushing directly or indirectly for their continuation.</p>

        <p>&rt; Whats your political standing you'd say? Who did you vote for if you voted?</p>
<p>Christian anarchist. I don't vote.</p>
<p>&rt;I've avoided referring to this community a name because I dont know what I should say. 'Anti maskers' is usually what comes to mind but I dont know if you guys consider that offensive or wrong like how everyone in American politics calls anyone with left wing beliefs 'communist' or 'socialist', so my question is, what would you call yourself? </p>
<p>As above. I have slim issue with masks and next-to-no issue with tried-and-tested vaccine tech. My problem is the abuse of lockdowns to facilitate wealth transfer, when tens of millions are dying because of them.</p>
<p>&rt;How do you feel about police? Big corporations?</p>
<p>Dimly, as organisations. But the people in them are just people, all the way to the very top.</p>
<p>&rt;What about these BLM protest and other social and political movements? </p>
<p>I prefer them to be as far away from central political power as possible. They've a nasty habit of being co-opted or misrepresented or used to channel funds and attention to other causes, like a Trojan horse.</p>
<p>&rt;I've watched a couple videos around the sub and checked the comments and it seems for the most part everyone does believe the virus is real, am I correct in thinking that? If not, what do you think is happening?</p>
<p>I think it's real, but certain facts about the way data is being handled (i.e. any death within 28 days of a positive test is logged as Covid-19 even if the person got hit by a truck) make it hard to trust. A university statistics professor wouldn't grade it; why should the WHO?</p>

        <p>My days go well, </p>
<p>to me it makes sense to wear a mask if you‚Äôre sick or immuno-compromised, no one should be forced to wear one; mainstream science is designed to benefit the pharmaceutical companies and there should be more focus on healthier lifestyles without dependency on drugs.</p>
<p>I hate politics, I did vote for Trump though, mostly in protest because the Democratic Party is just so full of snakes, but so are the Republicans.  They‚Äôre all criminals, just like the police.</p>
<p>I have a problem with social movements because of the disingenuous people who attach themselves to them just for acceptance amongst their peers; it leads to manipulation and brainwashing.  I don‚Äôt support people rioting/looting.</p>
<p>Plus politicians and corporations completely use and exploit social movements.  The whole censorship thing going on these days is just so artificial and it‚Äôs making everything robotic IMO.  </p>
<p>People should be allowed to have their own opinions and beliefs, words don‚Äôt matter as much as actions.  I also do not support teachers who try to push their political opinions on their students and all social movements have really become political movements.</p>
<p>I wish more people would get in touch with their spirituality.</p>

        <p>#1 Fine! Thanks for asking.</p>
<p>#2 The mask part is just a small part of a bigger picture for me. I wear it when required, so I have the right to bitch about it. If I believed in the bigger picture I wouldn't be skeptical of the mask. My response to the seatbelt thing is that it is a bad analogy. When I am driving I am demonstrably at risk. You don't wear a seatbelt when you are walking, for example, because you are not in a state of risk. Mask-wearing assumes you are a risk <em>all the time</em>. It makes your "default" <em>risky</em>. It's like wearing around a seatbelt on yourself all the time <em>on the chance you happen to be in a car</em>.</p>
<p>I really don't like how "mask thinking" makes us all into potential bio-terrorists. Psychologically that's what it is doing. There is no "super-flu" that is worth that.</p>
<p>#3 I used to think of myself as "left/Liberal" (not American). But I don't know anymore. Centrist?</p>
<p>#4 Yeah I think "anti-masker" reduces things down to the mask. It's a tactic."Oh what's the big deal! It's just a little mask. Cant your ego handle it?" But it's so much more than a mask. I prefer "lockdown skeptic" or "Covid skeptic". (Meaning "the phenomenon" of covid. i do acknowledge there is a virus. As do most here, I think).</p>
<p>#5 The police are fine (where I am) but there are bad apples, and punishment/accountability does seem to be a <em>big</em> issue. Big corporations are dangerous. BLM was a great idea the first time it happened at the end of the 60s. Now I think it's become .. <em>weird</em>.</p>
<p>What's happening? I think we are experiencing very big gears shifting.</p>

        <p>You want to come in here and ask the savages some questions? Because you're curious? I'm tired of this "explain yourself" to me bullshit from your lot. You don't care and are looking to argue. Just go away.</p>

The internet isn't now my only connection the the outside world because of covid, it always has been. Ive hung around all types of communities on the internet just out of curiosity, I have no biases I just wanna talk.</p>

        <p>To be honest, this one reads like some researcher trying to figure out how to best use psychology to get us to change our minds or just somebody trying to bait out some screen-cap worthy responses. </p>
<p>Until I see some honest attempts to engage, rather than a slate of the standard talking points (and by the way, these seat-belt lines are designed to be the sort of infuriating 'truthy' nonesense which best insults the intelligence of the people they are used against) I think that it's probably a waste of our time to answer any questions.</p>
