    <strong>Was Waiting in Line and Some Millennial Retar* Freaked Out Because a Gentlemans Mask Slipped Under his Nose for a Second.</strong>
    <p><p>Some random guy maybe in 40s, was waiting in line at a grocery store and I was 2 spots behind him. So his mask goes under his nose for like a slight second and the retar* infront of me starts screaming, </p>
<p>"ITS BC OF U ppl THE VIRUS IS SPREADING, STAY HOME, YOU DONT DESERVE TO COME HERE, MILLIONS OF PPL ARE DYING, MY FAMILY WILL SUE U IF I DIE FROM VIRUS."</p>
<p>Who tf is this pussy to tell anyone what they can or cannot do? He's just a pussy. That's all I know.</p>
<p>I was like wtf. I wanted to give this retar* a good punch and just knock him out. Then finally some cashier came and settled it. First of all, there was 6 ft distance and the gentlemen infront of me, his mask accidentally slipped under his nose for like a second, and this wierdo starts shouting like he's getting raped.</p>
<p>WTF? ðŸ¤¡. Also guys these ppl are the future of this country. These clowns will ruin the country more than it already is. Man, if no 1 was there I would have knocked him out, ahhh his voice. Legit screaming like someone is ass fucking him.</p>
<p>It's like going out for even grocery now is a headache. Its over man.</p></p>
