    <strong>Reminder: articulate opinions actually change minds!</strong>
    <p><p>As pressure looms over all of us I’ve been seeing a pattern of behaviour on both sides of the lockdown/vaccination debate.  Let’s be honest the condescending attitude of “I’m smarter” runs rampant in all of us (myself included). </p>
<p>What I’ve realized is civil and honest discussion has the power to trigger reflection amongst all kinds of people. As of recent I’ve interacted (here and irl) with people who I once would have brushed off as “lost to the mainstream” with actual reassuring reactions. </p>
<p>A genuine hope of mine would be that people stop blindly trusting their government and stop to reflect once an a while. Our goal is to spark thought in these people, which is only achievable through civil and informed discussion. </p>
<p>While we all hold differing theories regarding the true intent of this pandemic, try refraining from using them as talking points and instead spark change with information in which you can find common ground. </p>
<p>You’ll be surprised some of these “doomers” are more receptive than you think. </p>
<p>Note: I realize there are many people who are hateful and vehemently support the fear-mongering, vaccinations, and lockdowns. Some of these people will never honestly entertain the other side so not much we can do there.</p></p>

        <p>I totally agree with you. I try to hold civil discourse with those who come after me, and I'm always so tempted to yell or fight back, but I stop myself, as I want some of these harassers to become allies in this final war we're in. Thank you for this post.</p>
