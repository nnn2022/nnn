    <strong>Really pisses me off how doomers try to squash any positive news and turn it into something bad.</strong>
    <p><p>Covid is declining in my state for now, with hospitalizations and deaths going down each day. But oofffff course, all anybody can do is bitch and try to rationalize how this is NOT, in fact, something to celebrate. Now, I understand that we can't afford to become totally complacent the minute things start looking up, but for the love of god, why can't people just be <em>glad</em> that the tide may be starting to turn here??? Why does it always have to come back to blaming Trump, bitching about the small percentage of people not wearing masks, and trying to make things seem as miserable and hopeless as possible?</p></p>

        <p>Itâ€™s a religion for them. When covid goes away, these people are going to have absolute break downs. Watch. When Europe and the US open up travel between each other again, doomers are going to melt all the way down. They like how scared and miserable everyone is. Their loss of this shining moment in their lives will be annoyingly over dramatic.</p>
