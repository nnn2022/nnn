<p>My theory has been from the beginning that this is a scam to put young, healthy people on vaccine schedules. They perhaps tried with the flu vaccines, but they didn't have the proper ingredients, those being</p>
<ol>
<li>ubiquitious technology-this is needed to pump fear into people 24/7</li>
<li>shaming techniques-if you don't take this vaccine, you'll kill granny! (Then granny had a stroke and died anyway.)</li>
<li>tying vaccines to personal freedom. Some feel like the vaccine is the key to going back to normal. The vaccine was never needed as most people are not high risk. People could reduce their risk by losing weight, but that won't make Pfizer money. Someone on fb said he could finally hug his parents after he took his vaccine.</li>
</ol>
<p>Companies like Pfizer are losing a lot of money from not having adults 18-50 regularly taking vaccines. Imagine the money they'd make if vaccine passports were required. </p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>\&rt;While addressing investors at the virtual Barclays Global Healthcare Conference last week, Pfizer CFO Frank D’Amelio noted they could raise prices when the virus becomes endemic, meaning it’s regularly found in clusters around the globe, according to a <a href="https://investors.pfizer.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Barclays-Global-Healthcare-Conference/default.aspx">transcript</a> of the conference posted on Pfizer’s website. </p>
<p>\&rt;Current vaccine pricing models are pandemic-related, D’Amelio explained. After the pandemic is defeated and “normal market conditions” arrive, he noted the window would open for a “significant opportunity…from a pricing perspective.”</p>
<p>\&rt;The possibility of additional applications for the COVID vaccine may also present itself. A third dose could be needed for variants and regular booster shots, D’Amelio said.</p>
<p>\&rt;“We believe it’s becoming increasingly likely that an annual revaccination is going to take place,” he said. “Factors like efficacy, booster ability, clinical utility will basically become very important.”</p></p>
