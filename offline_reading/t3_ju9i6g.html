    <strong>So I was playing football outside and...</strong>
    <p><p>I saw 3 people playing basketball. They were masked as they rode their bikes to the playground but took off their masks after. Being the sports lover I am (and knowing I can dunk on that net), I decided to ask them, “Hey, can I take a shot?” They asked me, “with your ball or with our ball?” I said, “with their ball.” They said, “no, coronavirus.” I responded by saying, “alright,” and then dunked my football in the net THEY were playing on &amp; just stared them down. The short one told me, “we don’t like that you dunked the basketball.” I replied “whatever” &amp; walked off.</p>
<p>IDK if this is stupid or savage but thought It deserved a mention. I’m probably being a bigger idiot than them here.</p></p>
