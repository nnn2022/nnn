        <p>It was a war and the US rolled over intentionally. Not much of a victory to be proud of when your enemy sabotages themselves. The funny thing is, most people don't even know we lost and the folks who lead us into a loss are still leading us.</p>

        <p>It was a war. I work regularly with Chinese and come into contact with many different individuals all the time. They saw it as a full-on trade war and were taking a hit from it. </p>
<p>When covid came, initially, the hit was even more severe for China...for a couple months and since they've come out better than ever. Now, shits bustling. </p>
<p>China is spending $1t to develop high speed train connections with Europe, the rest of Asia and Africa; we're paying doctors to inflate covid numbers.</p>

        <p>I don't think it was that kind of victory. From the perspective of the folks I talk to, the economy was looking down and for the first time in decades, university grades were worried about their jobs. Then covid hit and they were truly worried, kind of worried to our regular American level in that some jobs were available, but they weren't guaranteed. Now, they are back to their previous high employment and prospect perspective. </p>
<p>The average Chinese citizen does not view covid was a biological war that they waged and one. Many see China's ability to eradicate it as justification for the path of submission to the government and obeying the rules. But it has had the effect of ending the economic slump and America's surge and has taken away the prospect of a US economic recovery.</p>
<p>For victory, they now get a US president who spent $2.3t to try to get us as much energy as we had before while China increases their capabilities unimpeded.</p>

        <p>Serious question: the Chinese Communist Party's corruption and cover-up lead to the spread of this virus. They knew perfectly that the virus was transmittable from human to human, so they blocked all domestic flights and travel from Wuhan, but INTENTIONALLY let INTERNATIONAL flights continue as usual. Due to them being a dictatorship, they LITERALLY locked people inside their homes for as long as they wanted, and eventually were able to get their economy back on its feet while the disease THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY INTENTIONALLY LET SPREAD ravaged the free world, crumbling its economy. My question is the following: why is so much effort put on criticizing Fauci, the CDC, Pfizer, and so on, and not those responsible for INTENTIONALLY crumbling the rest of the world's economy who even brag about  doing so?</p>
