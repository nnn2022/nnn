    <strong>I wish the vaccine came out while Trump was president. Because the narrative would be in full-force against the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>It shouldn’t even matter what your political beliefs are. I wouldn’t take it no matter who was president. It just came out. It’s experimental. 
But if the vaccine came out when Trump was president... imagine everything now regarding the vaccine, but OPPOSITE. Trump is hitler, the right are all nazis developing a vaccine so fast and releasing it to the public!!! The vaccine is  dangerous and we don’t know  the long term effects!! It’s Trump’s plan to kill us all!!Vaccine passports would be compared to nazi germany a million percent. It’s violation of your rights!!! My body my choice!!! 
Right now? Nah. Narrative is all chill, since Kama- I mean Joe Biden is president. Joe Biden is good. Every news station and major corporation is telling me so, so vaccine under joe biden good. No worries. Everyone is telling me it’s safe, and every anti-vaxer is a harm to the public!!! They must be socially penalized.</p></p>

        <p>It did came out under trump. And Kamala even said that if the orange devil will recommend it, she won't be taking it, which btw is is especially hilarious, given how trump actually said that people should be vaccinated, and she still got her dose of witch's brew</p>
