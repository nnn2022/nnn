    <strong>Dichotomies of Power</strong>
    <p><p>Some random satirical musings on why everything that’s based is bound to be censored and attacked in clown world.</p>
<p>Consider this: Who should possess power? A new establishment (anti-establishment) versus the current establishment (pro-establishment). What should power be used to defend? Individual liberty (libertarians) versus collective order (authoritarians). Should power be hierarchal in nature? No (left) versus yes (right).</p>
<p>These dichotomies can be condensed into three axes: one based on who should rule, another based on what they should defend, and a third based on whether or not their rule should be hierarchal. With this analysis, we can basically plot the alignment of any political movement within any context. </p>
<p>Global capital, of course, has no problem with any ideological movement that isn’t anti-establishment, pro-liberty, or anti-hierarchy. With this in mind, if you were to make a popular movement that advocated for demolishing the cathedral, blasting lockdowns off the face of the planet, and knocking the billionaire class down a few notches; you’ll probably find yourself attacked by the capitalist powers that be, regardless of what cultural aesthetic your movement uses; be it progressive or reactionary.</p>
<p>So where do I stand ideologically, and why do my favourite subreddits keep getting banned? Isn’t it obvious now?</p>
<p>First, my anti-establishment views are obvious. I’m skeptical of major shareholders in companies which are treated as being too big to fail, the cathedral, and the political system which exists to support both. What do we need? A hard reset of the economy, the media, academia, and the political system. Why? Because why not? It’s all been done before. Precisely what’s stopping a future American regime from expropriating all shares in Amazon, Exxon, and Facebook among others into a sovereign wealth fund, and giving the prior shareholders some form of low-impact compensation in return, like a special class of long term bonds issued by the state? What’s stopping the same future regime from withholding all state funding to universities and media outlets which are known to employ wokes, at least until they fire them all? What’s stopping said sovereign wealth fund in the first example from acting as a profit-seeking venture capital outfit that looks to fund and ultimately buy blossoming startups? Nothing, and the long term effects of these kind of reforms would likely be awesome, despite what the establishment and their bootlickers might have to say.</p>
<p>Second, I really like the philosophy of individualism, and that involves supporting the systemic defence of individual freedom from the will of the collective. All else being equal, I’d prefer to live in an avowed anti-lockdown dictatorship than in a liberal democracy which listens to the calls of it’s collective order-loving majority to be locked down hard with no end in sight. Seriously, fuck lockdowns, fuck the nanny state, fuck the karenocracy, and fuck marauding moral crusaders; if democracy enables that shit more than it stops it, who needs democracy?</p>
<p>Third, while I believe that the negative effects of hierarchies should be minimized, I feel that they do have some place within society, if society is to function properly. I want everyone to be paid an unconditional basic income which is enough to survive on, so that capitalists aren’t able to exploit, abuse, or coerce individuals. Likewise, I don’t think that anyone should be untouchable due to their position within society, thus the notional phrase “do you know who I am?” should become more meaningless and laughable than it already is. Today, you would have a much greater chance at getting in trouble if you successfully threw a delicious apple pie at the face of Bill Gates than if you threw one at me, and I want to change that for the sake of equality. Nonetheless, should labour violently seize the means of production from capital? Should a state of enforced equity be pursued? No, both would be far more destructive than they would be beneficial. I’m not opposed to capital’s existence, instead, I’m opposed to capital’s complete domination of society. With capital, comes hierarchies.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I doubt my views will be heard at Davos any time soon; despite the fact that, like them, I don’t like borders, national identities, or traditions all that much. It’s not about that, and it never was.</p>
<p>Global capital wants to forever continue greenwashing, pinkwashing, and blackwashing their beloved McDystopia; in the hope that normies don’t notice what a raw deal they actually have in this clown world. For that reason, the powers that be consider based memes and satirical shitposts like this one to be a threat to their agenda.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p></p>
