    <strong>Filled with anxiety after being around jabbed people today</strong>
    <p><p>I got my hair done today and my hair dresser had both jabs. Anyone who goes to hairdressers know their all in your face and touching your head and face a lot. That lasted about an hour and a half. Then after that was done I went to grocery store. Wasn‚Äôt too crowded but there were some people there. Pretty sure some of them were jabbed. I‚Äôm only 22 and I have my whole life of ahead of me. I‚Äôm scared of the whole vaccine shedding thing. Is it possible to second handedly get vaccinated just by being around the jabbed? Is my dna screwed? I‚Äôve been trying to be as a healthy as can for this exactly this. I don‚Äôt want to die young, I have goals and dreams. I have plans for my future. I want to LIVE. I‚Äôm literally filled with so much anxiety right now that I‚Äôm shaking and want to cry. I‚Äôm already trying to cleanse my body with water, tea and fruit just in case, as well as vitamins and minerals. I have been dreading going into public ever since I heard about this shedding not too long ago. I have literally been losing sleep over it. It‚Äôs keeping me up at night and I‚Äôm a Christian so I‚Äôve been praying to God nonstop that he protects me from the vaccinated and to put a protective barrier around me so that I can‚Äôt ‚Äúcatch‚Äù the vaccine or spike proteins second handedly. Do you all think I‚Äôm being paranoid and just really overthinking it?</p></p>

        <p>There is zero chance of shedding, the only possibility is from a live-attenuated virus meaning its a weak form of the virus in basic terms. Also as a fail safe humans don't have any machinery that allows for mRNA to DNA. This is why viruses known as retroviruses need to use reverse transcriptase which comes from the retroviruses itself. So your DNA is very safe other than the ~8 percent that's already put there from viruses....</p>

        <p>Because I think it‚Äôs fairly obvious you‚Äôre not gonna catch anything from getting your hairdressers hands touching your face. It‚Äôs clearly an anti-VAX sentiment, and I can‚Äôt get on with that. I believe in science.</p>

        <p>But <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/self-spreading-vaccines-self-amplifying-mrna-vaccines-covid-vaccine-menstrual-disruption/"><strong>viral shedding is real</strong></a>. Even if you don't want to watch the video, you can at least read all the scientific sources that were left right underneath the video. This journalist does his home work. Yes, I know I know, what <em>are</em> the chances of catching something from your hairdresser's hands? I don't know, but what if it's something in the vaxxed person's exhaled breath? We'll never know. </p>
<p>Good day to you.</p>
