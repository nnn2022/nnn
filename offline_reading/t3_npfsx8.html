    <strong>Is Compliance Considered Cool Now Then?</strong>
    <p><p>I can't help but find it amusing that most of the people religiously following the rules and restrictions with every fibre of their being probably think of themselves as radical rebels. After all, the most fervent Covidians are also the type to scream "ACAB!" and "defund the police!"; Hell, they probably even own a shirt with Che Guevara's face on it and enjoy singing along to "Killing In The Name Of".</p>
<p>Oh, and odds are they love Star Wars, Marvel films and Hunger Games. They idolize the likes of Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie for rebelling against the Galactic Empire; admire Captain America for fighting the Nazis and standing up for what he believes in during Civil War; and cheer on Katniss Everdeen for going against the Capitol.</p>
<p>Does it never occur to these people that <em>they</em> are the bad guys? That maybe complying with our psychopathic overlords and corrupt media fear-mongerers ostensibly in the name of defeating a virus with a 99.9% survival rate <em>isn't</em> a heroic or virtuous quality reminsicent of their heroes and idols? We are the Rebellion. You are the Empire. The very fact that this place, this subreddit, is the last bastion and holdout for us to speak freely and theorize should clue you in on that fact. This is our Hoth.</p>
<p>So, by today's standards is Luke Skywalker just a cringey old wanker (please don't bring up Last Jedi, that movie DIDN'T HAPPEN) who should have stayed on Tatooine and minded his own business? He DID get Grandpa Kenobi killed, after all, but if he hadn't joined the Rebellion the Empire would be in complete control of the Galaxy and Leia would be fucking dead or worse. Kind of like what will happen if we carry on letting these wankers lock us down, mask us up and divide us more and more.</p></p>

        <p>I think about that a lot.  My latest 'guess' is that they want to be part of "something big", kind of like surviving really bad weather; you don't <em>want</em> bad weather, but it's going to happen it's kind of fun if it's really really bad so you can brag that you survived it.  The mask wearing is a way to "prove" that this is really really bad, and then they'll survive it.</p>
<p>But I'm probably way off.</p>

        <p>Bad weather is a bad analogy since most teens can't even get wet in that pandemic. (lol)</p>
<p>I guess the setup was when Trump said after Easter it's over. Since most of the young are left they maybe still think that it is the morally right position.</p>

        <p>Not every teen. My daughters and their friends haven't bought into any of this. They outright hate it because it has essentially robbed them of their social lives, extracurriculars, and all the other things that are important by teenage standards. My one daughter, who already had serious mental health issues before this shit started, ended up having to be hospitalized after a suicide attempt, and it was 100% due to the lockdowns.  </p>
<p>Still, I do find it extremely bizarre that teens seem to be on board with conformity and compliance to this degree. I know there are always going to be the goody-two-shoes types, but even so. Makes no damn sense. Maybe it's just because I've been a lifelong delinquent and shit-disturber though.  </p>
<p>I was the kid who caught hell for questioning 9/11 on 9/12, lol.</p>

        <p>The state has either co-opted or outright created every modern leftist "resistance" movement. </p>
<p>Take the anti-cop rhetoric you mentioned. That isn't threatening to anyone in power. The government would be more than happy to defund local police forces and replace them with globalist shock troops.</p>
