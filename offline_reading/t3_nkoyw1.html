    <strong>Talk with me. Let‚Äôs figure some stuff out together.</strong>
    <p><p>It‚Äôs pretty obvious all of you here are against masks/vaccines and I just want to know why. I‚Äôll list the pros and cons of them (in my opinion but backed up with factual data), and I want to hear how and why your opinions differ from mine. If you want to make a claim that you see as a fact, give me a source from a reputable link (.gov or .edu preferably). It might get saucy in the comments, but hey, it‚Äôs Reddit.</p>
<p>Cons (what I assume the majority of you here see):
1. <em>Masks are uncomfortable</em>: yes, they are. They hurt my ears after a long time wearing them and I don‚Äôt exactly enjoy having to inhale and smell my own breath. I can‚Äôt really think of any cons aside from this.
2. <em>Vaccines hurt</em>: yeah, no one likes needles so it can be uncomfortable.
3. <em>COVID vaccines have been rushed and aren‚Äôt proven</em>: COVID vaccines have been created and approved at a faster rate than many established vaccines we have right now. There have been reports of side effects and have correlated to over 4,000 deaths (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html), which makes a death rate of 0.0017%. That should be a reason to have some degree of skepticism.</p>
<p>Pros (what I see):
1. <em>Masks help stop the virus from spreading to other people</em>: masks are an effective tool to stop your germs from spreading from your mouth to other people (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html). Moreover, they protect you from inhaling other people‚Äôs germs. The majority of droplets ingested into your body come in through the nose and mouth, so both must be covered with a mask for it to be effective. Masks don‚Äôt stop every single droplet, but they do stop the vast majority of them. Masks not only protect you, but the people around you as well. And no, they do not block oxygen flow (https://digitalmedic.stanford.edu/myth/myth-face-masks-can-reduce-oxygen-getting-to-the-lungs-and-bloodstream/).
2. <em>Vaccines have been proven to be effective</em>: the predominant vaccine in use right now is Pfizer, which has an effectiveness rate of 94% (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7018e1.htm#:~:text=Randomized%20clinical%20trials%20of%20vaccines,4%2C5). Note that it doesn‚Äôt not guarantee immunity, as I‚Äôm sure many of you have seen articles about people still getting COVID after being fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Final thoughts:
The numbers don‚Äôt lie. Masks and vaccines will protect you. There have been almost 600,000 deaths from COVID in the US, which is a rate of 1.8% (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality). There have been over 4,000 deaths correlated to the vaccine, which is a rate of 0.0017% (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html). I find it appalling that people aren‚Äôt afraid of COVID but they‚Äôre afraid of the vaccine when the death rate of COVID is over 1000x higher than that of the vaccine. In the end, I see the resistance to masks and vaccines as purely selfish because you would rather not slightly inconvenience yourself than protect the lives of everyone close to you.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading, now let‚Äôs have a discussion.</p></p>

        <p>Masks don't help. I know you can find studies that say they should help or might help, but where have masks actually worked? Certainly not in the United States. There is not one state where masks have made a measurable impact. Not one. Same can be said for Europe. We have had over a year of unprecedented mask usage in nearly every country on earth, and the data is clear that they have not slowed the spread of covid. Actual results of actual mask usage trumps theoretical studies about what masks are supposed to do. There is no correlation between mask usage and better covid numbers. If masks worked, you would be able to clearly see this in the data, but you can't.</p>

        <p>Very simple.</p>
<p>Look at mask mandated areas and areas that implemented strict lockdown measures in the USA, for example. Is there any correlation between strict measures like mask mandates and school closures/lockdowns and covid cases?</p>
<p>If not, why?</p>
<p>Answer that question, and then you can understand the viewpoint of most people here.</p>
<p>Until then, do some research instead of spreading your religious dogma.</p>

        <p>So the policy you think is effective relies on near ubiquitous compliance.....even when backed by law it is impossible to enforce. Additionally, there's no way to measure the level of compliance. Yet, you're chiming in like it is effective policy..... I don't even know what to say to you if you don't see a flaw in your own viewpoint, in that case you don't have the requisite intellect to discuss such matters.</p>

        <p>&rt;At the start of the lockdowns, no one really knew what was happening so we all went along with it. The numbers then began to go down as expected. Some people became sick of masks and started opposing the mandates, even though they were effective up to that point, and began ignoring them. That was the point when mask mandates became ineffective. There weren‚Äôt any consequences for not following it, so people didn‚Äôt.</p>
<p>I'm hearing a lot of conjecture with zero proof. Hence, this is your dogma.</p>
<p>&rt;It‚Äôs been proven to be an effective policy when people comply with it, and it‚Äôs proven to be ineffective when people don‚Äôt comply with it.</p>
<p>But in your own words, 50 percent of people by default don't comply, and we have no way of knowing how many complied...so therefore it is not effective policy - ever.</p>

        <p>So what do we need to do to make it effective in your view, threaten people prison time if they don't put a piece of cloth over their face?</p>

        <p>No experiment done in a lab can confirm the efficacy of a mask when worn over an extended period of time by the average member of the population. How often does the person wash/dispose of the mask, how well does the mask fit, what kind of fabric are they using, how is it influencing the risks they are choosing to take, how does it effect socialization? These are questions you need to answer before you go around spouting your religious beliefs. </p>
<p>It pains me that I have to explain this to you‚Ä¶</p>
<p>And this is the pitfall of people like you that think ‚ÄúMASKS WORK IN THE LAB, THEREFORE THE WHOLE POPULATION SHOULD WEAR THEM!‚Äù. It‚Äôs hilariously naive.</p>

        <p>There is so much data out there.</p>
<p>Here is a guy that goes through it all and creates graphs that hell visualize it. https://twitter.com/ianmSC?s=09</p>
<p>I personally go to https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries to look at the country and state data, then compare that to the mask policies or other restrictions. But you have to find that info on a place by place basis.</p>
<p>Here's another thread that is full of links. https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/ip5fu0/scientific_evidence_and_crosscountry_variability/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share</p>
<p>I personally prefer going through the data myself. Once you do that, the ineffectiveness of masks becomes abundantly clear.</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt know about the States. I am from one of the countries shown in the graphs and I can say safely that there was little anti mask sentiments and the vast majority of people have been very judicious at wearing them, leading me to state what I did in my last comment; that even if lockdowns were eased the spikes should not have risen so much if the mask wearing was actually effective.</p>

        <p>I think for healthy people to wear masks is not helping anyone. If you are coughing or sneezing and have tested positive and you have to go outside then by all means wear a mask.</p>
<p>I think the data would look comparable, but admittedly this is speculation as we do not possess that data.</p>
<p>I can tell you anecdotally that I even had COVID and was more or less asymptomatic and i was at work and sharing a vehicle with colleagues and not one of them caught it from me. This was in March 2020 before the first lockdown so I had gone into work but I isolated as soon as I found out - I wasn‚Äôt being reckless with my colleagues health! </p>
<p>Therefore this has also helped shaped my view about the effectiveness of masks.</p>

        <p>As I said I don‚Äôt believe they are needed in healthy or asymptomatic people. It‚Äôs a total overkill. Why would I want do something I think is utterly pointless? You may say why not err on the side of caution, but do you wrap yourself up in an rubber suit when you leave your house to prevent injuries...? No because you think it‚Äôs overkill. Well I think masks are overkill. People just have different tolerances for risk and you cannot make me believe in something I just don‚Äôt see the point of. </p>
<p>Also I take issue with the mask pollution problem we have nowadays which is immense. Wildlife is getting caught up in the elastic of discarded masks and they degrade to micro plastics. I would rather they wasn‚Äôt a thing or people at least used resusable cloth ones. I have no time for people who put their own health anxieties above that of the environment and place they live in.</p>

        <p>Well as somewhere around the 99.7% mark of people can cope with Covid just fine, I would say that the more at risk and vulnerable should be the only ones wearing masks and staying at home and taking precautions if they wish.</p>
<p>I think when any of us are clearly ill and infectious we should limit our exposure to others and not go to work. This is common decency. I don‚Äôt even go in if I have a cold. Luckily I am paid for sick leave, but the government could have statutory sick pay so that no one feels incentivised to go to work when they are unwell.</p>
<p>A minority of people will still die from Covid but we have to realise that though very sad,
this is actually ok and normal and natural to die at some point.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs an interesting question that you posit. </p>
<p>My answer is going to sound absolutely awful I realise so brace yourself.</p>
<p>But viruses do have some useful functions both at the individual and population levels. These are:
1. To strengthen and increase the repertoire of an individual member of that populations immune system (what doesn‚Äôt kill us makes us stronger.) This is not absolutely true as some viruses don‚Äôt kill us but have detrimental long term effects, but the general sentiment stands.
2. As a driver for evolution.
3. To take out the weakest in the population so that the next generation had a lower proportion of deleterious alleles.</p>
<p>If this virus was taking out young members of the population that are very sickly and weak, I would argue (and I am aware of how bad this sounds) that the virus is actually conferring an advantage for subsequent generations of the population.</p>
<p>Emotionally it is awful but objectively it is beneficial. I think when policy making is driven too much by emotion and too far from the fundamental laws of ecology this is when we start to play a losing game.</p>
<p>I would never advocate for doing this artificially (of course!!!) like say the eugenicists but I would say sometimes we ought to try and accept things and let nature take its course.</p>
<p>I would still say we should put measures in place to protect those vulnerable young like supporting them and their families to shield as much as they want, but still not all of society.</p>
<p>The impact that social distancing has had on otherwise would be healthy kids has yet to be seen, but I would bet that a significant proportion of them grow up fundamentally damaged in some way due to the lack of social interaction coupled with the panic and fear mongering that they have had to endure during their formative years. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to put healthy kids through that to save anyone who would naturally die of Covid young or old.</p>
<p>Now if the virus was targeting healthy children or adults there would be no need for these kinds of discussions as everyone would be happily doing all they could to avoid everyone else! We wouldn‚Äôt need government enforcements or mandates to coerce us into changing our entire way of living. We would just do it.</p>

        <p>My surviving grandparents one from either side, who are both now in their 90‚Äôs both caught Covid and thankfully recovered. One of them is especially frail and went into hospital and caught it there. My other two grandparents died a few years ago and they both died from conditions which would have made covid especially risky and worrying for them. 
So I get it. I have thought about it a lot. We all have elderly we care about. </p>
<p>Although covid is my no means a certain death sentence for the even the elderly and unwell like the media always portray, there is of course a risk.</p>
<p>Somebody that I knew went into hospital with stage 4 terminal cancer and caught it in hospital and died. He had been battling with cancer from some time and I thought had been looking quite well, but had to be taken in suddenly because of the cancer and he contracted it there and died. Two friends grandparents passed away from or with it who were both suffering from other serious illnesses. Their family couldn‚Äôt even see them in the hospital before they died. 
Isn‚Äôt that heartbreaking? 
Enforced lockdowns and visitors prohibited at the hospital and not being able to be with your loved ones. We are being denied the basic freedom of being with our nearest and dearest in their final moments. This shouldn‚Äôt become normalised. It should never happen again. It is criminal.</p>
<p>People are going to die with or without covid. It seems in my experience (very personal I know) older people are mostly catching covid in hospitals when going in with other conditions and sometimes dying. But some people who go into hospital never get out again even without covid. Maybe covid is accelerating peoples death by some days or weeks. Sometimes this even be a blessing depending on how your last few days during in a hospital can be as you will know if you have seen it first hand. </p>
<p>You know something if my grandmother had caught covid when she went into hospital it could have even have saved her many days of pain and unconsciousness and dignity at the end of her life. At least she was able to have her family around her. </p>
<p>The elderly are at risk from dying with or without COVID. They often have other conditions that puts them at risk. This past year they have been living in fear and denied any social interaction.
Some of them don‚Äôt have long left.</p>
<p>One elderly lady whose family (4 kids) hadn‚Äôt seen her for so long because she was shielding and vulnerable but as lockdowns eased they made a plan to see her but she died before lockdowns were actually removed and they never got to see her. They just thought they were protecting their mum, but she died anyway without ever seeing her family. I think it‚Äôs inhumane that elderly people have been denied seeing their families and friends and been told to cower in fear. No matter how long they have left they should be free to see their families, or take as many precautions against covid as they want.</p>
<p>But what would you do? How long do you envision the rest of us go about wearing masks and locking down for? </p>
<p>As a side note both my grandparents have had the double vaccine now and they both definitely seem to look and act more tired/old. They look like they did when they actually had covid and it took them both a long time to stop looking and feeling tired. Now they have had the vaccine they are looking like that again and it‚Äôs been quite a few weeks now. I am worried for them. I‚Äôm not convinced theres definitely a conspiracy to kill off the elderly with the vaccine like we can hear on here but there are certainly reports of side effects that you hear about and wonder whether there may really be a link. Some of my grandparents friends are reporting similar issues. My grandad even said he wished he hadn‚Äôt taken the second vaccine. Everyone‚Äôs medical choices are their own so I haven‚Äôt really voiced too much of my objection about taking the vaccine unless when specifically asked my opinion (as fundamentally mine are mostly because I cannot stand the thought of animal testing, but that‚Äôs a subject for another day).</p>
<p>Sorry for the diversion. But my point is...</p>
<p>Where do we draw the line? 
What do you think we should do?</p>

        <p>I also think masks have been a very good way for policy makers to at least seen to be doing something - even if that something is not actually effective. At least here in the UK it has since been found out that huge government contracts were given to government mates and cronies to supply PPE when these companies had no experience of supplying these products before and at huge over expense to the tax payer.</p>
<p>So forgive me if I am not convinced about the mask wearing.</p>

        <p>This is nonsense. No new knowledge informed his change in position. Please show me the new cutting edge science that emerged in April 2020 about cloth masks.  Good grief. This idea that we knew nothing about sars-cov-2 is such bullshit and it angers me that people keep repeating it as fact. This is just a dishonest way to make excuses for being consistently wrong and not having to be held accountable for it. Stop making excuses for incompetence and dishonesty.</p>

        <p>Ah, therein lies the problem. Mask mandates are founded   upon theoretical ideas that are based on strapping masks to dummies and relying on limited computer protections that assume humans are mindless robots. The reason I know masks don't work is because masks have not worked. It's that simple. We've had a year long experiment to see if masking of the general population is actually effective at slowing the spread of covid. And the results speak for themselves. Nowhere have masks done what they are "supposed" to do. Please show me where masks slowed the spread of covid. If a policy requires absolute unending compliance by every man, woman and child in order to provide a theoretical benefit, it is a bad policy to begin with and destined to fail. And objective failure is exactly what masks have been. And this is not surprising. </p>
<p>Look, I get that you have probably been shaming people who object to masks for the last year, so letting go of your devotion to masks will be hard. You've likely built an identiy around it. It has become a religion to you. And you are not only a true believer, but you are a faithful missionary proactively trying to convert the maskless unbelievers in the sub. It doesn't matter how many links I throw your way, you are dug in and most likely incapable of changing your views, regardless of what data is presented to you. It will probably take one of your trusted covid gate keepers to give you permission to doubt masks or any of tenets of your new religion. I honestly feel sorry for you. In 10 years you are gonna be embarrassed by your behavior.</p>

        <p>You are stuck on the idea that masks should work. For some reason you are convinced that if everyone would just wear masks, everything would be better (there is no logical reason to believe this, but whatever). But you can't separate theoretical mask effectiveness in a vacuum from actual mask usage by the general public in real life. The theoretical effectiveness of mask wearing is meaningless when you have to rely on absolute compliance by chaotic human beings everywhere in the world. It's like a football coach devising a play that on paper should be a touchdown everytime, and then being mad when it doesn't result in a touchdown every time it's run. A football play in a play book is only as good as its execution on the field. It doesn't matter how great the play is when it has to be run by actual players on the field. And the more accurate analogy would be a football coach devising a perfect play, then giving it to a bunch of random fans in the crowd and expecting them to run the play perfectly rusulting in a game winning touchdown. It's ridiculous, yet for some reason you are convinced that if mask compliance went from 80% - 90% we would finally beat covid. It's an irrational belief based on nothing but fantasy. </p>
<p>If you are a scientific person, then you can't possibly view mask mandates as scientific. Mask mandates are based on very flimsy science to begin with (which is why masks have never once been recommended during the multiple global pandemics over the last 50 years). On top of that, they have been implemented with no standards, no end conditions, no universal equipment requirements, no tracking, no enforcement, no definition of terms, no buy in from the general public, etc. To call mask mandates scientic is an embarrassment to actual science.</p>
<p>I proved you with links that have plenty of data which you have chosen to ignore. The person on Twitter has complied countless graphs using the official data that show the ineffectiveness of masks, but because it is not the CDC or some other "approved" source you won't even consider it. Just so you know that is how cults keep its members indoctrinated and trapped. The other link is a reddit thread with a comprehensive list of scientific studies that you should accept as reputable, but most likely will conveniently ignore because it goes against what your leaders have told you. Your behavior is typical of a brainwashed cultist, and you probably should stop calling yourself a scientific person, since your views aren't actually supported by science.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is 94% effective at reducing relative risk, not absolute risk. That is a big distinction. The people who got the placebo had a very low absolute chance themselves of testing positive despite not getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>Also, there is no way to tell how safe they are in the long term since no such testing has been done. Plenty of other vaccines in the past were rolled out and had to be shelved later on because they were not safe, such as the 1976 swine flu vaccine or the Salk polio vaccine, and those had way more time and testing put into them that anything on the market for COVID.</p>

        <p>Here is a Lancet article from April of this year discussing the absolute vs relative risk reduction of the COVID vaccines and what it means in terms of practical public health policy.</p>
<p>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00069-0/fulltext</p>
<p>Here is a much more lengthy discussion published on the NIH website. </p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996517/</p>
<p>Another issue at hand is the design of the Phase 3 trials. The manufacturers got to define the terms themselves, and at least in Moderna's case they had a very different definition of what counts as a COVID case. They counted only symptomatic COVID with two or more systemic or one respiratory symptom, and a positive PCR test. The CDC of course doesn't have such a stringent requirement for a person to be counted as a COVID case.</p>
<p>https://www.modernatx.com/covid19vaccine-eua/providers/clinical-trial-data</p>
<p>The question becomes, if they just used what the CDC counts as a COVID case, what would their results have been? Also, what if they used the old standard of a 40 cycle threshold of PCR versus what the CDC now uses, which is something like 24 or 25 cycles IIRC. They don't tell you what their PCR threshold was set to. I could make sawdust look like a vaccination if I required symptoms which resemble common cold and then just rigged the PCR cycle threshold without disclosing my testing criteria.</p>

        <p>Wife had COVID, so either I got it from her or my immune system is too strong to get it despite having every kind of physical contact imaginable with an infected person. There is no reason for me to get the vaccine anymore than someone who had chickenpox, needs a varicella vaccine.</p>

        <p>The NNV rate of the vaccines is so high that you'd have to vaccinate a minimum of 70-some people just to prevent one case of COVID, some of them would require even more than that. One of those articles also discusses that metric.</p>

        <p>A high NNV is an indicator of a low absolute risk reduction and/or a low chance of getting the disease in a natural environment. It is good in the case of an effective vaccine for a rare disease, but if a disease is not rare then it tells you that the vaccine may have a limit to how much time and money you should dump into it. Compared to the high relative risk reduction, it tells us that COVID is hard to get for an unvaccinated person. This is a good thing but it's a sign of diminishing returns if you want to start an expensive global vaccination campaign.</p>

        <p>You should focus on your own health and accept that other people have juristiction over their own bodies.</p>
<p>Being conservative about this particular injection isn't so  unreasonable, considering every day more information comes to light involving adverse reactions. Who really knows what the science will say in 1 year, 5 years, and 20 years into the future? Maybe if you are a healthy young person, the potential unknown side affects will be more trouble than covid. Which we are told is highly contagious, but not if you wear a bandana to cover your face, and it has been well over a year now and every town and city in the world has already been exposed, and to think natural immunity has not taken affect for people who have already recovered from covid seems like it's all pushing the same false narrative. Very anti science.</p>
<p>If you want to convince people to be healthy like you, you should strive to be a champion of health. </p>
<p>How healthy are you really?</p>
<p>How often do you exercise? What do you eat? What's your sleep like? What about your mental health? How often to you touch a stranger? You're supposed to have at least ten positive physical contacts per day. That's science.</p>
<p>Your focus on masks and injections does not seem like a path towards healthy living. It actually seems very unhealthy.</p>

        <p>It's a matter of how much damage are you willing to do to contain the virus. So far COVID has killed about as many Americans as the number that died every year from cigarettes and medical errors. Nobody in their right mind would say we need to do something drastic like print trillions of fiat dollars, shuttle tons of wealth from the middle up to the very top, shut down businesses, schools, basically every aspect of modern life, and exacerbate an epidemic of violence, substance abuse, and mental illness just to try to contain cig smoking and medical malpractice, nor would anyone do that for heart disease or cancer or AIDS, not even for polio. We didn't even do that for smallpox.</p>

        <p>Smallpox had a death rate above 20%, COVID isn't shit compared to pandemics of the past. COVID can't even touch Spanish Flu. We did all kinds of insane things to counteract it but they didn't work and they never took steps to tell people what put you most at risk.</p>
<p>None of this has anything to do with saving lives, if it did then they would be telling you to go to the gym and get some sunlight, they would be pushing vitamins nonstop, they would have told you over and over again that obesity and low Vitamin D levels are big indicators of getting severe COVID, and they would be banning McDonald's and high fructose corn syrup. Where was Fauci's face on the TV telling you repeatedly to take a multi and a D supplement, and lose weight?</p>

        <p>The flu affects a rather significant number of people and we have never done anything like this for the 50,000 people who die every year in the US from the flu, and you would have been called a nut job if you ever called for doing that prior to 2020. How come we don't just lockdown forever because of the flu then? Our vaccines for flu do nothing to quell that death toll.</p>
<p>Also no, you don't get to vote out your government, you just get to vote out the current middle managers of your government, but the left and right all work for the same core of unelected people. Fauci has been there for 40 years and is the most highly paid person in government, he has survived many administrations and you can't vote him out no matter how badly he screwed up HIV and COVID.</p>

        <p>Don't wear a mask, science says they don't work. Oh never mind, do wear a mask, science says it works. Actually, the science always said it works (in reality it really didn't) but I lied about it because I didn't want you to buy the same types of masks that professionals use. You know, maybe you should wear two masks instead of one. You should keep wearing a mask and social distancing after you get vaccinated. Oh never mind, vaccinated people don't need to wear a mask. Why did I wear a mask despite being vaccinated? It was performative and had nothing to do with science.</p>
<p>Do we really need to discuss how Fauci messed up this entire situation? There is a damn good reason people stopped listening to the man.</p>

        <p>&rt;If you don‚Äôt trust studies conducted by top medical experts in the country, then who do you trust?</p>
<p>I trust doctors, nurses, scientists and independent journalists who've had their Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media platforms banned. I could produce actual medical studies for you, but every time I share something the other person ghosts me, or has some weird rebuttal that the information I'm using isn't valid (even though it comes from reputable researchers). </p>
<p>I feel you have an agenda here, and I don't appreciate that. I think it's fair to say you never even took the shot, and just want others to take it. Or even if you did, then why are you here bothering us? Do you enjoy mocking or belittling us? </p>
<p>Tell you what, <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/spike-protein-covid-vaccines-putting-you-aserious-risk-according-science/"><strong>just watch the video in this hyperlink</strong></a> (and I mean all of it), and make a rebuttal of what Ryan has to say. I've watched every video of his, as well as clicked on the links he's provided below every video, and I have enough information to know that these vaccines are not what they are intended for.</p>

        <p>Only 6% of deaths reported for Covid had covid only. 94% had comorbidities.</p>
<p>https://www.bizpacreview.com/2020/08/30/enron-level-scandal-cdc-reports-just-6-of-covid-19-deaths-occurred-in-people-without-comorbidities-966362/</p>
<p>So you‚Äôre already starting off knowing our numbers aren‚Äôt completely accurate. </p>
<p>Using your 660,000 figure. 6% of that is 39,600.</p>
<p>About the amount of deaths caused by car accidents. Granted it wouldn‚Äôt be all of the comorbidities but I think that 660,000 is a bit disingenuous.</p>
<p>Plus, as you notice we have been keeping a running tally. It‚Äôs been a year. You would think they would start talking yearly totals.</p>

        <p>Yea but their effect is limited at best and it has to be combined with other measures like social distancing and lockdown to have an impact. Here in the US I can tell you they do not work because NO ONE is social distancing or locking down. I also don't care much anymore cause I'm fully vaccinated and don't need to wear one in 99% of the places I want to go to</p>
