    <p><p>As you all know everyone has been impacted by lock downs and restrictions in one way or another. <br>
Some have been more effected than others. Some people have made posts how it has totally ruined their lives and we have even had a few posts where people have contemplated suicide. To those who are feeling that way we care and would not like that to happen. Remember their are resources and people to talk to.</p>

<p>As a community we should be supportive of one another in such trying times. If someone makes such post be supportive and uplifting. They do not need to hear how"well this is the world now" or some other insensitive comment. If you have nothing nice to say perhaps not say anything at all. Also negativity in such threads will not be tolerated. A negative comment to people contemplating such things might just be the thing that pushes them over the edge.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>To those dealing with mental health issues. I just want you to know we care and there are many that care about you are your well being. This shall pass.</p></p>

        <p>Don't you already have a sub for this? What happened to the positive NNN?</p>
<p>This sub should welcome any and all comments, negative and positive. On top of that, sometimes people need to be given a dose of reality and cynicism. To act like everything is automatically going to be okay no matter what feels like naivete or denial, especially since things still look pretty dire right now. With the fall/flu season approaching, there's likely going to be a harder push than ever from the pro-lockdown crowd for more restrictions, so we need to continue being vigilant.</p>

        <p>"This sub  should welcome all comments negative and positive"Totaly agree.I was following the official covid 19 sub when it first started.It seemed like a relatively civil place to get information before any of this was on the average US citizens's radar.Since then it has went through so many iterations and themes.Finaly landing on what it is today.Kind of closed minded.</p>
<p>Were all approaching covid from a diffrent vantage point.Were all effected diffrently,and we all have different opinions.This sub dose have kind of a theme where people can voice there oppinions that are not necessarily popular.Thats what I like about it.However we need to make an effort not to be closed minded like the subs im shure so many of us migrated away from.</p>

        <p>If anyone wants a place to talk about their mental health related to the lockdown I've got a Discord group. Just reply or DM me and I'll send you a link. I also know how to run a second anonymous discord account on most devices (except iPhone, still gotta figure that out) so I can help you stay private if you don't want you're main discord associated with it. My DMs are open!</p>

        <p>It's been awful. I was really doing okay at first and the extra income with unemployment was helping a ton, but now that's over, I'm struggling to find a job, I left school, and it's so hard to focus and I'm so tired. I have a video meeting with a new therapist this week so I'm hoping that helps. I'm just wondering what comes next? Even the things that made me happy before, like going thrift shopping are just not as fun anymore because wearing a mask is stressful (to me. I haven't gotten used to it and I always feel like I'm struggling to get enough air). The arrows on the floor and the constant loudspeaker reminds of social distancing make me feel like I'm living in an apocalyptic novel. I am so grateful for my cats and my loving partner because they are helping me keep going.</p>

        <p>A couple years ago when I lost my best and pretty much only friend, I went through a long period of agonizing grief, which was only relieved when I got the courage to start solo international traveling. For me, the traveling restrictions are the toughest issue ðŸ˜ž</p>
