    <strong>Something Random I Noticed</strong>
    <p><p>So, I was watching an analysis of a tv show episode just now, and the guy who was analyzing the episode said two things that, despite the show not having anything to do with the virus, I automatically connected to this situation. </p>
<p>One thing was when he said "At the end of it, and as always, what we're talking about is choice and freedom, as that is the only access to our authenticity." He is completely right in that. The maskers just don't understand that taking away our freedom also means taking away who we are. We can't be ourselves if we aren't free. </p>
<p>But another thing he said which I thought was even better was "Sacrifice that isn't given freely is servitude." This made me realize something important that I'm surprised I never realized before. Sacrifice is one of the buzzwords during all of this. I've heard it constantly. My governor said that the high school seniors this past spring would have to sacrifice our special once-in-a-lifetime moments. I've heard them say on the news that we have to sacrifice family gatherings for the holidays. People who agree with this government overreach justify it by saying "we're in a crisis and sacrifices need to be made." I've heard people say we need to sacrifice our freedom in times of "crisis" which I don't believe this actually is. We have to sacrifice our normal way of life. Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice, but when the guy doing the analysis said that, I realized that it was completely true and made me think about this even deeper. Those people who are doing this crap freely, sure, I guess maybe that's sacrifice since they agree with it, although not rightfully so. But for the rest of us who don't wish to change our lives because of a virus, this ISN'T sacrifice. It's servitude, slavery.</p></p>

        <p>Reminds me of Ayn Rand:</p>
<p>"When the common good of a society is regarded as something apart from and superior to the individual good of its members, it means that the good of some men takes precedence over the good of others, with those others consigned to the status of sacrificial animals."</p>

        <p>These people who push these restrictions don't really have authentic identities anyway, and they probably never did. :(</p>

        <p>Well. Said. My. Dude.</p>
<p>Very well said. When you say “the maskers just don’t understand that taking away our freedom...”, realize that is just one possibility, and that’s becoming less likely by the day, week, month. What I personally believe is the more likely reason is that some entity/ies do realize your freedoms are being taken away, and it benefits them to do that to you. In other words, evil intent. That’s where I chose to believe we stand.</p>

        <p>There is a growing demand to sacrifice whats yours, both physically and spiritually, to the old gods.</p>
<p>Never allow your mind—the governor of [and intermediary between] your body and spirit to be captured. Never be slave in neither body nor spirit. Be strong and seek Truth always and in all ways.</p>

        <p>Forced sacrifice reminds me of calling supermarket workers "heroes" as if they have a choice and are willingly sacrificing themselves for the greater good and not just dealing with it because they have bills to pay</p>
