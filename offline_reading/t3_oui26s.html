    <strong>My province has hit 80% with one dose; our top public health official has started talking about 'consequences' for the unvaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;    "It is a choice to be immunized, but there are consequences for people who are not immunized and that's going to be more important for us as we head into the fall, as we know that this virus will increase and we're likely to see other respiratory viruses," [British Columbia Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry] said Tuesday.</p>
<p>&rt;"We will be looking at the measures that we need to put in place to protect people, particularly those who are most vulnerable."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt;    "There are consequences to not being immunized even though it's not mandatory in our province," [BC Health Minister Adrisn Dix] said.</p>
<p>We've hit the herd immunity threshold! Blew past it, even.</p>
<p>And why are we now talking about "other respiratory viruses"??</p>
<p>I was starting to think I'd gone paranoid from pandemic stress, but here it is! </p>
<p>80% vaccinated and they're ramping up the pressure? If this was only about COVID, they should be cheering, surely? Congratulating us? Breathing a sigh of relief?</p>
<p>Instead they're dragging "other respiratory viruses" into the story and talking about "choices and consequences".</p>

<p>This same woman said a few days ago that she doesn't have unvaccinated guests at her home, despite being herself fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>&rt; Henry also encouraged people to ask guests coming to their homes if they have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>&rt; ‚ÄúI know, myself, I‚Äôve had people over to my house, but only the people who are vaccinated. I‚Äôm not ready yet to have people over who aren‚Äôt.‚Äù</p>

        <p>yeah the most vulnerable were double vaxxed by april I think.</p>
<p>BC went by age brackets, and the younger crowd wasn't even eligible for a first shot until sometime in spring (except for healthcare workers).</p>

        <p>Wish I could find a legal way into the US. </p>
<p>But I need a visa. </p>
<p>My work experience is all administrative/clerical so I don't qualify for "skilled professional".</p>
<p>Could look at education visa but (1) i have a degree already so might seem sketchy to border officials; (2) Can't afford 4 years of school at international rates; (3) visa process takes at least a year.</p>
<p>Not sure there are any other avenues.</p>
