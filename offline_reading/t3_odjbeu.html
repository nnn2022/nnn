    <strong>"Ask your physician"</strong>
    <p><p>I'm so tired of seeing people say "you should ask your physician", these are the same physicians that claim they had no idea that prescribing Oxycontin would lead to the opioid crisis because the pharmaceutical companies said it was safe.</p></p>

        <p>As a physician myself, I will tell you that a lot of physicians are drinking the Flavoraide. But than there’s doctors like me that saw this for what it is from the beginning. I’m fact I’ve been very vocal in my community about abandoning hysteria and embracing the scientific method of analysis. I’m noticing that some of the doctors who were quiet about it at first are now feeling a little more relaxed in expressing views that don’t match the techno-narrative.</p>

        <p>I actually was born into a religious cult. I left it several years ago. Part of my exit was to understand cult-like thinking. I did a deep dive into Jones and how he commandeered some intelligent people into his destructive cult. I’ve thought about how expected it was that Jones picked the cheap knock-off Flavoraide instead of Koolaide. I mean if your gonna kill 900 people .. it’s a final evidence of his disdain for those that gave him their lives. If he truly believed in his bullshittery .. you’d think he would have taken some of the cash he left behind to have an amazing last meal.</p>

        <p>How does a non-physician find a physician like you? When I was in for my physical a few months back, my doctor told me that when the vaccine was available to me, I should get it. Given my age and weight, this tells me he is drinking the Flavorade, rather than considering my risks and benefits. I have no doubt he'd flat-out refuse to even consider Ivermectin if I tested positive for corona and brought it up to him.</p>

        <p>I have to ask, because I lose sleep wondering:</p>
<p>Are some doctors just that gullible? </p>
<p>How is it we're trusting them with our lives, sometimes on a daily basis, and they can't make critical choices on if a treatment is safe?</p>
<p>It's blowing my mind. My ex is a PA and took our teen to get it. I still can't process his sheer ignorance. </p>
<p>He can't be that stupid, can he? Is he getting paid to Vax his family? I don't understand.</p>

        <p>I haven't been through medical school, so I might be completely off here, but I get the feeling that most doctors just memorize facts. It's way easier to just remember everything than try to figure out why things happen - so no critical thinking skills.</p>

        <p>This is correct. Memorization and order-taking. Never questioning what they’ve learned and always assuming they have access to the latest and greatest info so there’s no way anyone knows about something they don’t. Sick with an illness they can’t diagnose?? You’re making it up. It’s really quite pathetic that people worship them.</p>

        <p>Yes, there is a reason the whole concept of a “second opinion” exists</p>

        <p>Most PCPs are NPCs. They look very narrowly at symptoms and mostly treat with drugs. They’re not taught nutrition in school, nor are they taught to view health holistically. There are very few creative, critical thinking physicians, it’s a shame. 
The last major issue I had, I diagnosed myself after having gone to a few docs. I chose a specialist, and told him what I thought the issue was. He ran some tests and confirmed it. This is the medical system being a fucking joke.</p>

        <p>From urbandictionary (this is how I understood the term, I just decided to copy and paste rather than write my own explanation):</p>
<p>A play on video games "non-player character" mixed with a play on The Simulation Hypothesis. An NPC is seemingly a human that is unable to think objectively. We exist in a simulated reality and some humans take on the role of NPCs, spouting "opinions" they are programmed to spout and repeating in a cult-like manner.</p>

        <p>I've always hated that advice. Just because a person has "MD" on the end of their name doesn't mean they're any good at healing. It just means they passed medical school, maybe barely. They could have been a C student who showed up hungover to every lab. They studied from materials and books sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. The majority of Drs appts last 10 minutes or less, hardly enough time to say hello and build rapport, much less get a holistic picture of a person's health, lifestyle, and nutrition which affect/cause their symptoms. I diagnosed myself with 2 rare heritible genetic conditions, and my husband's ADHD, when multiple Drs failed both of us and missed them all. 
You are your own best healer. Always research and advocate for yourself. Do not put blind faith in Drs (or ANYONE) Not all Drs are bad at what they do, but be realistic-the constraints of their schooling and time impact their efficacy.</p>

        <p>Doctors consist of the same mix of good/evil, informed/ignorant that makes up any group of people. Just because they are a doctor, you trust them? Fuck that. They have their heads up their own asses just like most people.</p>

        <p>I think there is definitely a time and a place for asking your doctors about something. I’m not anti-medicine even though I generally avoid doctors.</p>
<p>What bothers me is when people report having horrible vaccine side effects on the covidvaccinated subreddit and people are just like “ask your physician!” As if they’re going to know what to do in this unprecedented situation</p>

        <p>My sister and brother-in-law are both MDs. I asked them some basic questions about the digestive system and my bro-in-law responded “you know more than we do.” They don’t know shit about health and they’re starting to realize it. Slowly but surely they’re starting to leave and retrain in things like functional medicine, holistic health, nutrition etc.</p>

        <p>I know a lot of people who waste their time and continue getting worse by searching for medical answers online, particularly asking people medical questions (to which the only correct answer is, in fact, ask your physician). Big pharma's obviously a scam but self diagnosis and self-medication aren't typically something I'd recommend. Happy Independence Day!</p>
