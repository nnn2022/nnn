        <p>"Not the kind of lockdown it should be", what's the alternative then???? THERE IS NO FUCKING REMOTELY LOGICAL ALTERNATIVE!!!!!! I assume she wants to eat? Live? Exercise? Converse with other human beings? If the answer to any of those questions is yes, then the past/current lockdowns have demolished that, let alone "other kinds of lockdowns" that she's eluding to. </p>
<p>I just can't comprehend what these people are wanting, I guess they're just waiting for the news to tell them they can be a normal human being again?</p>

        <p>I know this will be the unpopular opinion on this sub, but with the context you have provided they don't seem crazy, or at least there are scenarios I can imagine where they are right and you are wrong... Like check yourself buddy, I don't know what else they said but having this reaction to only the part of the conversation you show, you must be frothing at the mouth everytime you hear anyone's voice. I'm not going to assume you didn't but if I was in your shoes I would continue the conversation respectfully, for example like 'yeah, a lockdown with a measurable impact and without changing goalposts might help, at least it won't erode freedom and independence for nothing'...</p>
<p>Anyway TLDR learn to talk to someone who doesn't share your opinion, get pissed if they get unreasonable.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm totally ignorant of LA and no I'm not going to look into it.</p>

        <p>LA is not still running. What do they mean by running? All you can do is get take out and go on a (masked) walk. He/she can stay home if they'd like.</p>

        <p>From a psychological/personality standpoint, I do find it fascinating to see what's going on here. Our personalities are in some way very similar, but some ways extremely different (I'm big into astrology and will happily discuss that if anyone wants to), but she was always the friend who would protect me when I was vulnerable or being bullied at school etc. And just very down to earth, meanwhile I'm more emotional. Who would have thought that someone like that would be the brainwashed one and me, the self doubting cynic, would be seeing straight through it.</p>
<p>From a personal standpoint though, it really does come down to the simple premise that I absolutely cannot stand having someone take my choices away and think they know what's better for me than I do. I had no idea how strongly embedded that was in my personality until last year.</p>

        <p>I'm here in LA, I'm curious at what more of a lockdown they could want... Almost nothing is open minus grocery stores and big box stores (at best) and you can get take out... How much more of a shutdown did this person want</p>

        <p>I think what I'm learning is just how desperate people are to be noticed and if that's true, I feel truly sad for them, and I say that with wholehearted conviction and no animosity. Since my city has now forced masks upon us all, I live in a quiet suburb outside of the city. I go for a walk twice a day and have for the last 3 months. So I've gotten a good idea of the people around here, I know the people I pass on walks etc. But since the mask mandate, I'm seeing all new people (overweight, what a surprise) with the masks on, while exercising.</p>
<p>Please someone I beg you to tell me I'm wrong, but these are people I haven't seen prior to the mask mandate, ever. Until they get to wear a mask and can walk around telling the world how good and obedient they are. They seem legitimately proud to be doing this.</p>
