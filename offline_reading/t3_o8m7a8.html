    <p><p>I think the elites definitely fucked up after they shifted the vaccine goalpost yesterday, since plenty of them were begging and hoping that it would be the end of the hysteria. Now on this sub, I've noticed posts that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apologizing to us for "doubting" or calling us conspiracy theorists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posts on other coronavirus subreddits that seem to finally acknowledge that "maybe" the conspiracy theorists had a point, even if they didn't 100% say sorry yet, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/o832pp/mega_based_rcoronavirus/">here's a great example of that.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The posts on this sub usually hover around 70-89% upvoted, but lately I've seen much more upvotes, indicating less trolls have been downvoting unlike the last few weeks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I think its about to get wild, and in a good way, folks. If I get off the internet (where the delta fearmongering is running rampant, full of dread) I notice that people in real life here don't actually seem to care anymore, even after what the WHO recently said (although thats probably because I'm at Texas)</p></p>
