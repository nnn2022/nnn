    <strong>Something for you guys to read and do some research on (Terrain Theory)</strong>
    <p><p>2.5 million deaths over 7.5billion = 0.003% so 99.997 survival rate.This over 365 days. Also 90%+ are literally just elderly people or very very unhealthy patients. While 2/3 would have died in the next 30 days the average age is 82.4y old, literally more than the average lifetime expectancy in Europe.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>No dude there is nothing spreading, just a PCR test that means nothing beind used because WHO told us to do so. They need numbers to manipulate you. They find sick people and that's it. coronavirus is the most common virus there is on the planet. Everyone will test positive at some points. And not because of spreading, if you are unhealthy your body will have a cleaning mechanism when you feel weak and this mostly happens during winter.</p>
<p>This cleaning mechanism that your body activates is coronaviruses that work in your body so you feel symptoms. Look up Terrain theory vs Germ theory. Louis Pasteur's Germ theory is rockefeller funded and is our guidebook for the whole medical industry and Pasteur was known to be a fraud and his Rival Béchamp has a Terrain theory that explains the cleaning mechanism of your body.</p>
<p>Lets explain this like I would explain it to a child(covidiot). Lets say you have something dirty/unhealthy somewhere in a place and you see flies flying around. Is it the flies who made that thing dirty or is it that thing that attracted the flies? This is literally how people would think before we had the germ theory, people did not know. but the germ theory actually supports the flies making the 'thing' dirty and unhealthy instead of the correct Terrain Theory explaining how it is a unhealthy subject that will attract flies. Or in today's case: viruses that your body manufactures little things we call viruses to fight your unhealthy cells because of external factors (unhealthy lifestyle, poison).</p>
<p>This is why people say the medical industry actually makes people ill. It is true, sadly. And thats to generations of brainwashing based on lies... Those studies are from early 1900's. Louis Pasteur rockefeller funded is even known for frauding in his carreer and admitted on his death bed that his Rival was right and how much he did regret what he did to prove his theory. This plandemic was planned a very long way. I've got books from the 80's till one writen in 2019 mentioning a global pandemic for forced vaccination and what goes with these vaccinations.</p>
<p>Why do you think we never had doctors wearing masks during casual visits from patients and why did not everyone catch the same disease while sitting in a waiting room unmasked? Why do you think they need cells to carry a virus in a vaccination and why isn't a vaccine based on water if a virus could survive in droplets?</p>
<p>Kinda what I learned the last year but every controlled opposition (people like alex jones and david icke) feed you with things we want to hear like lockdowns aren't effective or masks don't help but what they actually do is drive you in the lies of a virus spreading instead of actually explaining what really is happening. They feed people part lies and part truth so that you truth seekers feel fed and don't look further.</p>
<p>So ya it may sound Taboo but there is no virus spreading</p></p>

        <p>Yup, terrain theory seems correct. The entire pharmaceutical industry is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-purdue-pharma-settlement-history-fact/purdue-oxycontin-settlement-would-rank-among-largest-in-pharma-history-idUSKCN1VW2KL">corrupt.</a>  Medical “education” is Big Pharma’s complimentary racket.  It’s all owned by eugenics-loving racketeers, as are governments, lying politicians and the media.</p>
<p>Trust the $cience.</p>
<p>&rt;”Sometimes a medical doctor will take his "reputation" in his hands and come out with a spade-calling dissertation on a favorite medical myth. Always the Drug Trust and its stooges and mediums do their utmost to destroy any such "upstart" who has the temerity to endanger even the slightest percentage of their monetary profits. ^1</p>
<p>&rt;I can remember the statement by Dr. Chester A. Stewart, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at the Medical College of the University of Minnesota (subsidized with $216,-643 of Drug Trust money), writing in the Journal Lancet:</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;”The occurrence of sudden shock reaction following the administration of serums to children who have been immunized by 
toxin-anti-toxin injections undoubtedly is far more common than a survey of the literature indicates. The writer has found considerable number of physicians who have had similar experiences which were not reported.</p>
<p>&rt;&rt;<strong>”Why do doctors talk 'prevention' with such uncertain remedies? Why are they seeking the power to control the public, to compel the administration of their many questionable remedies? It may be a matter of humanity with some, but it is more a matter of money with those of the swivel chair type."</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”In the great majority of cases the toll of <strong>the major killing diseases of the nineteenth century declined dramatically before the discovery of medical cures and even immunization</strong>...^2</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Rene Dubos, the microbiologist</strong> formerly with the Rockefeller Institute, succinctly summed up the historical record. <strong>”The tide of infectious and nutritional diseases was rapidly receding when the laboratory scientist moved into action at the end of the past century,"</strong> Dubos wrote in Mirage of Health. "In reality," he observed, <strong>”the monstrous specter of infection had become but an enfeebled shadow of its former self by the time serums, vaccines, and drugs became available to combat microbes.</strong>” ^2</p>
<p><em>Emanuel Josephson, M.D. writes:</em></p>
<p>&rt;##MEDICAL EDUCATION AND THE ROCKEFELLERS</p>
<p>&rt;”Competition became extremely keen in this medical school business. As a consequence the overlords of medicine found that they were not gaining the full advantage which they had hoped from their medical schools. <strong>They thereupon set about establishing a monopoly of the medical school business and wiping out their competitors.</strong> ^3:93</p>
<p>&rt;The merchants-in-medicine, organized in the A.M.A., found allies in their fellow merchants in industry at the beginning of this century. <strong>It is peculiarly fitting that the agency that enabled them to monopolize the field of medicine and its education should be the General Education Board, an outgrowth of Doc William Rockefeller’s quack cancer cure and medicine show.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;##RESEARCH ACTIVITIES OF ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE</p>
<p>&rt;”The commercial interests and alliances of research institutions are less obvious but are quite as real as those of the drug manufacturers, when they are not identical. <strong>The establishment of the Rockefeller Institute marked the firm saddling of big business and its methods on medical research.</strong> From the start an alliance was formed with the American Medical Association.”  ^3:107</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The American Medical Association is the front for the Drug Trust.</strong> The AMA furnishes the quack doctors to "testify" that, while they often know nothing of the product involved, it is their opinion that it has no therapeutic value.” ^1</p>
<p>&rt;##The Food and Drug Bandits</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”This Bureau — now known as the Food &amp; Drug Administration — is used primarily for the perversion of justice by "cracking down" on all who endanger the profits of the Drug Trust.</strong> The Bureau occasionally prosecutes, on its own initiative, smalltime opportunists who should be prosecuted. Thus in a few small cases the Bureau does good work.</p>
<p>&rt;Its principal activities, however, are as servants of the Drug Trust.” ^1</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Control of the Food and Drug Administration, health departments and other government agencies have given the Rockefeller Drug Cartel a virtual monopoly of marketing of drugs, especially of new drugs.”</strong> ^4:112</p>
<p>&rt;”The Food &amp; Drug Administration was converted by the Drug Trust into a device that would leave them <strong>free to engage in any type of skulduggery with impunity,</strong> but would enable them to drive competitors out of business by hampering regulations and excessive expense involved in compliance with arbitrary rulings and harassments.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”One of the officers of Schering Co., an affiliate of the Drug Trust, openly has stated that the maintenance of a drug monopoly is one of the objectives of the Food &amp; Drug Administration.”</strong> ^4:119</p>
<p>&rt;##The Drug Trust</p>
<p>&rt;There is an old and true saying that he who pays the piper calls the tune. ^1</p>
<p>&rt;The Rockefeller Foundation pays the medical college pipers from the profits made by the Rockefeller Drug Trust and of course the Drug Trust calls the tune.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The Rockefellers own the largest drug manufacturing combine in the world,</strong> and use all of their other interests to bring pressure to increase the sale of drugs.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Many so-called "medical discoveries", however, have been announced by the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever. <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable</strong> purposes and have been <strong>exploited commercially and intensively.”</strong> ^4:110</p>
<p>&rt;“How many of the <strong>fake "discoveries" have been patented and exploited for the advantage of the Rockefeller Institute or its sponsors,</strong> has not been revealed by them. It is a matter of record, however, that the Lederle Laboratories, subsidiary of Rockefeller controlled American Cyanamid Co., <strong>intensively exploited the worthless “anti-pneumococcus" serum "discovery" by the Institute's workers; and though it was known in scientific circles to be worthless,</strong> enough of it was unloaded on the <strong>sucker public,</strong> at exorbitant prices, to make the Company and its stockholders a sizeable fortune.” ^4:111</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The Rockefeller interests have steadily expanded their holdings in the drug industry to the point at which they control the major drug concerns in the world,</strong> and are rapidly absorbing new ones by the process of merger. They have all been integrated into a <strong>cartel</strong> that maintains an absolute monopolistic control of the drug industry.” ^4:112</p>
<p><em>Historian, Antony Sutton writes:</em></p>
<p>&rt;##American Medical Association</p>
<p>&rt;”For the moment we want only to note that the impetus for reorganizing medical education in the United States came from John D. Rockefeller, but <strong>the funds were channeled through a single member of The Order.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Briefly, the story is this.  One day in 1912 <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Taylor_Gates">Frederick T. Gates</a> of Rockefeller Foundation had lunch with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Flexner">Abraham Flexner</a> of Carnegie Institution. Said Gates to Flexner:</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”What would you do if you had one million dollars with which to make a start in reorganizing medical education in the United States?"</strong></p>
<p>&rt;As reported by Fosdick, this is what happened:</p>
<p>&rt;”The bluntness was characteristic of Mr. Gates, but the question about the million dollars was hardly in accord with his usual indirect and cautious approach to the spending of money.  Flexner's reply, however, to the effect that any funds -- a million dollars or otherwise -- could most profitably be spent in <a href="https://rockfound.rockarch.org/public-health-at-johns-hopkins">developing the Johns Hopkins Medical School,</a> <strong>struck a responsive chord in Gates who was already a close friend and devoted admirer of Dr. William H. Welch, the dean of the institution."</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Welch was President of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research from 1901, and a Trustee of the Carnegie Institution from 1906.”</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Welch">William H. Welch</a> was also a member of the Order and had been brought to Johns Hopkins University by <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Coit_Gilman">Daniel Coit Gilman.”</a></p>

        <p>3 steps to get out of the madness...</p>
<p>1 ) pharmaceutical and surgical quick fixes never work fully... they mostly weaken the natural immune systems self-healing capacities<br>
anyone who is abusing emergency laws to divert people s attention away from their own self-healing capacities and towards the pharmaceutical /surgical medicine business makes itself a complice towards a dehumanising depopulation agenda what envisions the avarage citizen as complying with every chemical/pharmaceutical business furthering political regulation, feeding itselve voluntarily with health-deteriorating sterilising toxic chemicals</p>
<p>to insist on freedom of movement, freedom of assembly being most important for body autonomy<br>
( to be able to choose at all times where to be with whom is an essential requirement for supporting ones body fitness wellness ) equates opposing global guidelines locking down/phasing out individual personal sovereign behaviour</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>lockdown, masks, vaccines<br>
bad<br>
----</p>
<p>free movement, free assembly, body autonomy<br>
good</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
2 ) regional state and nation state dominating the local community ( village/town/city ) = bad</p>
<p>sollution: renewal of states constitutions so that all political hierarchies get dissolved and all political decision powers get shifted towards the local community, abdication of regional and nation state in favor of the local community receiving full absolute sovereignity<br>
the (full) assembly of all children, youth and adults being permanent residents of the local community, each one with the very same weighted voting power, creating, maintaining and interpreting the laws what are valid within the territory of the local sovereign community<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
3 ) once the local community has become its own absolute sovereign, it might use the inherited material and financial wealth of the abdicated regional and nation state to buy agricultural and forest land from private owners ... with the intention to redistribute land towards everyone who does not have private wealth<br>
a lifetime loan of 1000 m2 without tax duty without rent duty envisioned for every human being on earth so that everyone may be free of having to serve anyone else, so that everyone may be free to build its own house with its own hands and grow its own vegan foodstuffs</p>

        <p>the self-healing capacities of the immune system growing with every virus and every strain of bacteria the human being welcomes in its stomach, gut, intestine or where-ever in the body there is a bioreactor like space where our very own cellular memory awareness is playing host for these or that sort of fauna</p>
<p>as I look at it ... immunity is reached when one has incorporated the knowledge of all fellow beings of all living species on planet earth ... something like  ... until one has not learned everything from everyone ever met ... as long as one rejects to learn from a meeting offered ... one s own catalog of informations regarding behaviours and substance compositions is incomplete and one might at times feel down a bit when some not yet known fellow virus or bacteria has made an unannounced visit<br>
as a considerate amount of energy is being used by the cellular awareness to integrate the newly learnt stuff from this unexpected visitor</p>

        <p>there is no enemy</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>only some incomplete understanding how we all relate to each other in the web of life</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>no bacteria, no virus is or was ever an enemy, they are the messengers of the web of life, like algorithms what come to help us detect all what we have hidden in ourselves on the mental/emotional/physical body level</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so how was it possible that we collectivly were so much in favor of shooting the messenger instead of listening to what it has to say ?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>modern society is built upon the idea that who wants to amass more money or societal prestige before others needs to sacrifice something for it, most of the time its hours spent at the task what then promises to bring these extra amounts of money and societal praise gains</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>these hours spent more at the screen, these extra hours spent longer on the construction site then have its toll on the mental/emotional/physical health ... for some time it might be possible to hide or overlook the damages, the dense clusters of toxins in ones own body being accumulated trough stress, overworking, angry hatefull conversations with also too long working collegues and bosses etc. etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so here then comes the pharmaceutical and surgical business model offering a seemingly quick fix ... nobody needs to take some time off to recharge and clear out the inner garbage ... but the dense clusters of neglect and garbage filled cells just get surgically removed or bombarded with some more toxins sharp chemicals etc...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>untill then a certain virus comes what sees trough all these pseudo sollutions and finds a way to circumvent all the self-delusion and shows us how these quick fixes, how these pills lowering high blood pressure along with all the other pills supressing symptoms what actually are indicators that its high time to do some fundamental lifestyle changes</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how most of the pharmaceutical and surgical medicine modells are not really helping but just postponing the great inner clean up </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>so what happens ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we as a human society seem not to be ready to go for it, take the challenge, take some time off and do this necessary inner cleaning, get off the medications and start building up a good life on healty food, joyfull movement and fullfilling relationships</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but instead ... we choose again an other pseudo sollution, a most dangerous one what will certainly produce more harm than good ... we choose to accept emergency laws being abused for our freedom of movement, our freedom of assembly being restricted and with it .. our body autonomy too gets compromised... the choice to decide when we want to be where with whom allows the body to work like it is supposed to be ... motivation comes from wanting to be with others, enjoying activities with others</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we as a human species are playing a most dangerous game with using the coronavirus as the bogeyman, as the scapegoat just because we are not willing to renew our sickening lifestyles</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>we as a human species are crippling ourselves by rejecting the offer of help the coronavirus is bringing with, the offer to assist us doing the necessary dietary, work and private relationship changes</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there is no enemy ... nobody what needs to be fought, no bacteria strain or virus ever having any hostile intention ... just us human beings intentionaly not accepting the offer of the virus to help us change what needs change</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>but it is not too late</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>if this year of humiliation, house arrest and threats of at all times being sent into self-isolation or quarantine was the price for us to learn how it is not done ... how we have not achieved anything but made it even worse</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>then let us take the lesson and move on into a brigther future</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>where we possibly will say</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>thank you my dear friend coronavirus, please come in, please help me check out where i have hidden in my bones and my joints, in my organs and in my flesh the rejected pains, the toxins, the poisons ... please help me look carefully at all the dense clusters, the obstructions and i will do my housecleaning, i will give my best to honor your detective works results</p>

        <p>also possible to think of all bacteria and virus being assistants, coming to us from the web of life to help us detect where in our bodies we have toxic deposits, dense clusters of stuff what best would be upcycled, recycled so it is no more blocking the flow of energy</p>
<p>no bacteria, no virus is or ever was an enemy for someone who is willing to learn the truth about ones own level of health</p>

        <p>I think he may be controlled opposition still. I’m just saying don’t rule it out because he talks about reptilians and I don’t eat that shit up and I also don’t just dismiss it but a lot of people do dismiss it. We also don’t know if he is being misleading as to what the reptilians are about. Donald Marshall has a crazy story too. Donald claims Icke is controlled opposition. More than that</p>

        <p>It's one thing to question scientific consensus the handling of an emergent phenomenon like we have seen in the last year but germ theory has been the almost universally accepted model for disease since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>.  What "Terrain theory" is doing is the name people use who believe that Pasteur was wrong and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_B%C3%A9champ">rival</a>'s theory was right but ever since then, everyone has been wrong since some how.</p>
<p>This is bunk science that says "diseased tissue attracts germs rather than being caused by it.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_denialism#cite_note-brock-3">[3]</a>".</p>
<p>There is a difference between what people commonly mean when they say theory and a <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin/evolution-today/what-is-a-theory">scientific theory</a>.  A scientific theory is almost universally agreed explanation for something such as the theory of evolution.</p>
<p>If there is some new evidence for this idea that was for the most part rejected back in the 1800s, feel free to post it here.</p>
