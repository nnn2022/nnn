    <strong>I don't know what's worse: the physical or ideological distancing between my friends and family.</strong>
    <p><p>On the one hand, I miss them like crazy. On the other, they're becoming people I want fucking nothing to do with, let alone see. The longer this goes on the wider the gulf between us becomes until the friendships and familial bonds we once cherished fall into the abyss. It hurts me knowing my family and friends give more of a fuck about following the rules and appearing virtuous than they do about me. I am clearly not having a good time right now, to say the fucking least, and yet I'm expected to suck it up and soldier on because "wE aRe aLL iN tHiS tOgeTheR" and they're doing okay: bit bored, bit tired, but working from home is good and financially we've flourished!</p>
<p>In my darker moments I wonder how they'd all react if I did end up doing what I'm sure we've all thought about doing the past year at some point or another. Would it wake them up or would they chalk it up to a necessary collateral calamity: a noble sacrifice in the face of defeating Covid. Maybe they just wouldn't give a fuck, who knows? I'd never go through with it though; why give the bug-eyed wankers overseeing this fuckery the satisfaction? I'm seeing this shit through, even if it ends with me living in the attic keeping an online diary.</p>
<p>I can't sit back and ignore what's going on. I refuse to keep my head down and power through to the next lockdown like some scared German citizen in the 1930's and 40's. I am resolute in my belief that we are on the right side of history: you only need to look at the vile comments left by those who visit here to troll and argue. Our opposition are a bunch of weak-willed, smooth-brained cuckmeisters devoid of empathy and reason. They see freedom as a threat. They mock the very notion of it: "mUh FrEeDuMbS!" It's no wonder they handed it over so easily.</p>
<p>They kept us distanced so they could deepen the divide. Person to person interaction is so important. When you have everyone spewing their unfiltered thoughts onto social media every single second of the sodding day it makes it incredibly difficult to hold a meaningful and respectful conversation about complex issues such as this. Thank the fucking Lord we live in an technologically advanced age where working from home and tracking people's vaccination status easily are viable options, eh? OTHERWISE NONE OF THIS FUCKING SHIT COULD FEASIBLY HAPPEN.</p></p>

        <p>Agreed, OP.</p>
<p>But then again, my entire immediate family have revealed themselves to be the sort of individuals who'd rat you (me included) out to the Gestapo/NKVD/Stasi without a second thought and smugly tell themselves that they've done "their civic duty" and genuinely believe it despite all the evidence I show. How am I <em>not</em> supposed to lose at least a little respect for someone like that?</p>

        <p>Damn, I know this feeling. For example, my dad deliberately brought up the jab topic yesterday, proceeded to call me things like ‚Äòidiot‚Äô, ‚Äòstupid‚Äô and even likened me to a h-denier‚Ä¶ then hung up the phone without even letting me defend myself. Today he told me that I ruined his fathers‚Äô day.</p>
<p>I swear this vaccine is making people more aggressive, or perhaps it‚Äôs that they fear the unknown and are repulsed by those brave enough to not be forced into it. It‚Äôs a weird kind of projection/jealousy thing perhaps. Either way, the division is real. I still push through it and refuse to let comments get to me, in situations like this one has to ‚Äòturn the other cheek‚Äô and ignore it, when people lash out they‚Äôre projecting their own fear and self doubt onto you. One must stay strong.</p>
