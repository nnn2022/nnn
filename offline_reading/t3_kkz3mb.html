    <strong>How would you leak the truth about Covid-19 &amp; ensure it went viral if you were to stumble on legitimate, irrefutable proof?</strong>
    <p><p>Let's say you're a healthcare professional or part of city council in a major metropolitan area, and you're privy to an abundance of high-up conversations, the contents of which are under strict NDA and leaking them will cost you your job + career if you're not careful. Maybe you're on a mailing list with important doctors and reps from various regions in your state/province, maybe you're friends with a fellow council member on a newly created Covid board and chat with him daily because he's an old college friend... the sky is the limit here. For role playing purposes, you're connected.</p>
<p>Let's say you stumble on irrefutable proof from legitimate internal documents or emails or meetings that Covid hysteria is overblown and none of the Covid precautions - lockdowns, masks, social distancing - are even remotely warranted.</p>
<p>I'm talking about the head of healthcare in your region admitting in a private email or tape recorded conversation that <em>"this is all bullshit, it has no basis in reality. It's all comorbidities we're blowing out of proportion to scare people."</em> Something to that effect. Something absurdly damming that would end lockdowns overnight, or at least within the week/month the moment the info went viral.</p>
<p>How do you go about leaking this to the general public?</p>
<p>Keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mainstream media will ignore your emails.</li>
<li>Mainstream media may even report you to the authorities.</li>
<li>The police won't care and can't do anything.</li>
<li>Social media has been carefully curated this year to shut down people like you.</li>
<li>There are disinfo shills everywhere that will attempt to discredit you</li>
</ul>
<p>You have whatever your personal budget is and whatever connections you have currently IRL, to pull this off.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>I feel like there are hundreds of people around the world in this spot, possibly monitoring this very sub. Let's give them some ideas.</p></p>

        <p>This is precisely the current problem.</p>
<p>There have been tons of bombshell, narrative-crushing, reality-restoring behemoths all year long.  But the Media just ignores it.  Which gives moral licence to the doomers to also ignore it.  </p>
<p>If main stream media started doing their jobs rather than performing mind control, we'd all be in a much better spot.</p>

        <p>Well. You’ve got to have people around you that are willing to help spread little bits by word of mouth. Start getting it slowly into people’s heads. Even if they call you a nut job, it’ll sit with them. </p>
<p>In terms of social media, maybe make a throwaway Reddit account. Post in subs like this. Make sure people are able to save whatever proof you have before it gets taken down. Maybe DM it to a few people to make sure they get it. </p>
<p>Under an alias or anonymous still reach out to right wing MSM. Someone will at least listen. Make sure you maintain anonymity during interviews (like how they keep people in shadows and disguise voices). </p>
<p>Once you do this, you’ll have the people you gave the info to earlier doing the same. Sure social media can shut down a few accounts, but the more it spreads like fire, the less they can control it. </p>
<p>Even if social media like FB put the false information flags, people will get curious and read anyway. </p>
<p>It doesn’t start off big. You don’t just throw a massive stone in a lake. You throw a pebble. Let it spread. Get others to throw pebbles of their own until it has the effect of a massive boulder.</p>

        <p>The sheer volume of politicians who don't follow their own Covid guidelines is getting cartoonish at this point, but it hints at a bigger development.</p>
<p>I'm under the belief they're privy to info we're not, which means there are definitely internal emails or meetings where someone shoots straight with them and admits the virus is a giant nothing burger.</p>
<p>The question then becomes, how do you leak these Emails or teleconference meetings in a way that everyone will see them and you can bypass media censorship?</p>

<p>now here’s my opinion: I think now is too late, (yes I’m very pessimistic) I think there’s already OVERWHELMING proof all this is totalitarian bullshit. the problem is that most of the people are ok with that. nobody want to fight.</p>

        <p>Here are some ideas:</p>
<p>If you plan to upload any videos to YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook, there's a high probability that it may get taken down, due to, "certain rules". If you do plan to do this, try not to title the video as something, "obvious", to your objective. A title such as, "Coronavirus is fake! Here's proof!", will really get the video flagged for a take down. Titling it as something relevant, but very generic, will help it survive much longer. </p>
<p>Don't just rely on the most common video-hosting platforms to host your videos. See if it is possible to use Vimeo, DailyMotion, and other low-key options as a way to host your videos.</p>
<p>While Reddit prevents links from BitChute to be shared on its site, that doesn't mean that the source video itself is prohibited from being shared on the site. Convert it into a common valid format, such as a gif with sound, to make sharing it easier.</p>
<p>Utilize common file-sharing outlets, such as Dropbox an Google Drive, to share material that is hosted from those places. </p>
<p>Torrents can also be made to share files, since they are hosted from a decentralized source. The only problem with this option is that references to their links may be prohibited by certain websites. </p>
<p>Some links to information can also be sent to others privately by means of PMs and DMs. Even conventional email can be used to share such information.</p>
<p>If all of your evidence is in one package for download, make it all available as both, individual downloads and together in a folder as compressed file format. This provides flexible options for you audience, as they too, might need to reference links to those parts of your master download that they are only interested in.</p>
