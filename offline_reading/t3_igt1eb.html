        <p>This is a well written op ed (particularly by nypost standards lol) and worth reading in its entirety.</p>
<p>However:</p>
<p><em>Everyone has choices now. You can live in the music capital of Nashville, you can live in the “next Silicon Valley” of Austin. You can live in your hometown in the middle of wherever. And you can be just as productive, make the same salary, have higher quality of life with a cheaper cost.</em></p>
<p>This I take issue with. Once schools/ corporations realize THEY have choices, many will hire for the bottom dollar. They will outsource to cheaper states and countries whenever possible. If  this happens, no one with a desk or teaching job is safe and we'll see salaries spiral downward.</p>

        <p>IF (big if) the cost of living matches, that scenario can work out. Overseas offshoring has other issues including language, time-zone, culture, and legal. This also means that people are less tied to their countries. I would be open to living overseas with a good salary at a location with low cost of living.</p>

        <p>I grew up in NYC - and I assure you this is different. </p>
<p>Short term memories maybe for your favorite band or that last heinous murder you read or watched on tv but this is different. </p>
<p>There was already a drip-drip of people leaving NYC in the last decade - it had started to pick up a few years ago. It will only get worse. </p>
<p>The city is over crowded, noisy, smelly. Its only attractions were the mix of people and nightlife, restaurants, social functions and access to stores and transportation. </p>
<p>Lock downs has shown companies the light. Revealed the managements fears of a non manageable remote work force was unfounded. </p>
<p>Lock downs have shown uselessness of high priced rental spaces and the inability of the police to protect business and people when it counts. </p>
<p>Lock downs have shown the draconian side of city leadership, and the hopelessness of living in 5 boroughs packed like sardines yet unable to do anything</p>
<p>My friends who live in NY state (outer suburbs - Rockland, Orange, Dutchess) faired much better than those who lived in the city in terms of basic freedom of movement and social access during quarantine  - driving to parks for fresh air, meeting up with friends, violating stupid quarantine orders with private gatherings among friends</p>
<p>Its like the first time you get robbed or lose your belongings in a fire, YOU NEVER FORGET</p>

        <p>There is also the double-whammy of the protests and riots. Many New Yorker's stayed in the city following the lockdowns, but the riots convinced many of those with 2nd homes to leave.</p>

        <p>NYC and most democrat run cities are pathetic. </p>
<p>They deny you your 2nd amendment rights by making it unbelievably difficult to purchase firearms of any type (shotguns, pistols) leaving you completely at the mercy of police response time. </p>
<p>I could NEVER move back into that environment. The decade I lived in NY state (Rockland, Orange, Dutchess, etc) after moving out of the Bronx, I and the exwife owned shotguns. And it was fairly simple to acquire once you passed the FBI criminal background test. </p>
<p>And we bought several shotguns/shells for both shooting and home defense. </p>
<p>We didnt want handguns because we had a young child so I cant comment on what it takes to purchase one. </p>
<p>Point is we never felt it (firearms for home defense)  was inaccessible and all our neighbors were armed home owners. </p>
<p>This is another reason I laughed when some mob protesters threatened to bring heat to the outlying suburbs in one interview.</p>
<p>I chuckled "you mofos dont know nothing about the burbs ... you are confusing tv and movies with reality" </p>
<p>Folks in the suburbs will respect your 1st amendment right to PEACEFULLY protest. </p>
<p>You violate that and you will come to understand why we have a 2nd amendment</p>

        <p>I'm so tired of people bringing up the stupid Spanish Flu, including our side.</p>
<p>These two situations are different, the eras they happened in were different, society was different. </p>
<p>This may not kill "dances, cities, movies, etc" but it will likely change them forever, and likely not in a good way. I think people will stray away from all of those examples you gave for a long time, and if things don't improve, jobs relating to those will likely go away. Permanently. But nah, let's be "optimistic" and just assume life will go back to 100% normal by the election, right?</p>

        <p>To be fair, I have no interest one way or the other with New York.  But while time doesn’t repeat, it does rhyme, and those who fail to learn from history repeat it.  </p>

        <p>Unfortunately I am wont to agree with u/rombios.</p>
<p>I've lived in nyc 30 years. I've remained optimistic through this that we will bounce back. But...</p>
<p>The mayor just came out saying there will be no indoor dining until next year.</p>
<p>Corporations are permanently closing office space in favor of WFH or suburban areas.</p>
<p>NYPD morale is at an all time low. I've had bad experiences with these guys myself but an unpoliced NYC is not a place anyone will want to live.</p>
<p>With a decimated economy and tourism industry our tax revenue has tanked. This will have dire ripple effects.</p>
<p>There isn't going to be a bounce back... maybe a crawl back, if we're lucky. But if crime and blight continue to rise, and the homeless population gets increasingly aggressive, which it has been, we may not even get that.</p>
<p>Like I said I've been optimistic over all these months but these f*ckers seem hell bent on destroying the city. I've never seen anything like this in all my time living here. And I've talked to lifelong NYers who've said the same.</p>

        <p>These circumstances aren’t unique to NYC.  The scale may be different, but this is happening everywhere to an extent—including many overreaching politicians.</p>
<p>Organizations cutting office space is the future.  Covid accelerated that, but that’s a problem many organizations are solving with full time or expanded wfh.</p>
