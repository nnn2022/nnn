    <strong>If someone in your household has COVID-19, there's only a 1-in-10 chance you'll catch it too, study finds (showing just how contagious this is...)</strong>
    <p><p>Just one in ten people who catch Covid pass it on to someone they live with, a study has found.Â </p>
<p>US researchers analysed data from more than 7,000 homes in Boston and found more than 25,000 people lived thereÂ between March 4 and May 17, 2020.</p>
<p>In this time frameÂ 7,262 people caught Covid but they only passed it on to a further 1,809 people they lived with, a transmission rate of 10.1 per cent.Â </p>

        <p>I had Covid. It was when weather was changing so I just shrugged off the cold/hot changes I was experiencing.</p>
<p>Worked a full day and a half in an office with 8 other people and directly shared a land line phone with someone several times. Went home after I was sweating profusely in a meeting. </p>
<p>No one else got it.</p>

        <p>My niece had covid, she has 5 other people in the house and not one of them got it. I wasn't scared of catching it anyway but that really made me laugh how this virus that is so contagious we can't even breathe around each other clearly just...isn't.</p>

        <p>For example, three people in the household tested positive for antibodies while two (including myself) tested negative while having direct contact for long periods of times during the infectious period while not getting sick at all. This is just how infectious and dangerous the overblown flu is guys. Clown Planet.</p>

        <p>Sounds right. My kid tested positive with some symptoms that lasted a WHOLE 48 hrs. Nobody else got it even though we didn't bleach the house, make him wear a magic mask, or quarantine him to his room and push food under the door. I had a friend actually do all that when all her kids got it. ðŸ™„</p>

        <p>When I had Covid my partner and I continued to share the same bed. The family quarantined together for 2 weeks. Assumed he got it but remained asymptotic. Fast forward 3-4 months and he gets it and we all have to quarantine for another 2 weeks. Ugh, like I thought weâ€™d already gotten it over with.</p>

        <p>the study says 20% of households have had at least one case of infection within the house, not 10%. this is not adjusted for the number of houses that have had a covid case, or the number of cases per household. this is also built on the very shabby reporting of covid cases. after accounting for all of this the number could go any which way.</p>
