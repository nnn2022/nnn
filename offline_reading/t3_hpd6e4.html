    <strong>Our Digital World &amp; COVID-19</strong>

<p>&rt;“They  are programming people”, Harris says. “There's always this narrative  that technology's neutral. And it's up to us to choose how we use it.  This is just not true”. “They want you to use it in particular ways and  for long periods of time. Because that's how they make money”</p>
<p>Tristan Harris, a Silicon Valley whistleblower that worked at Google and co-founder of the <a href="https://humanetech.com/">Center For Humane Technology</a>, in a 2017 segment of <em>60 Minutes</em> with Anderson Cooper. Cal Newport continues in his 2019 book <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/"><em>Digital Minimalism</em></a>:</p>
<p>&rt;“After  graduating [in computer science, Harris] started a master's degree  working at BJ Fogg's famed Persuasive Technology Lab – which explores  how to use technology to change how people think and act. It was at  Google, now working on products that could impact hundreds of millions  of people's behaviors, that he began to grow concerned”</p>
<p>Tristan sent a manifesto to some friends, which eventually got him a meeting with Google co-CEO Larry Page. He was appointed <em>Product Philosopher</em>. Yet nothing changed.</p>
<p>&rt;Harris blamed the lack of changes to the <em>inertia</em>  of the organization and a lack of clarity about what he was advocating.  The primary source of friction, of course, is almost certainly more  simple. Minimizing distraction and respecting users' attention would  reduce revenue. Compulsive use sells. [...] So Harris quit, started a  nonprofit called Time Well Spent with the mission of demanding  technology that “serves us, not advertising”, and went public with his  warnings about how far companies are going to try to “hijack our minds”</p>
<p><strong>Have our minds been hijacked during the 2020 pandemic?</strong>  I believe that the current digital landscape played an important part  in how the general public perceived the Wuhan Coronavirus. Ultimately,  it influenced how governments and health authorities responded to it and  how much the public accepted official measures.</p>
<p>The  24-hour news cycle provides never-ending low quality updates on  emerging issues. Long is gone the time when the evening news were the  only time you could catch up on the latest information on TV. As people  hear more and more about the same topic, their perception of its  importance grows. We deem information true much more quickly, with  little scrutiny. As headlines, red banners and masked reporters filled  our living rooms with rolling updates on increasing death counts and  case confirmations, we became more and more afraid of the virus.</p>
<p>Distancing  yourself from the news cycle is vital for you to thrive. But the very  fact that disconnecting is not a habit for most people (not many people  spend a single day without checking their social media feeds) deprived  the public from the necessary <strong>distance and solitude</strong>  needed to think critically about new information. Coupled with poor  skills on setting apart badly from well-researched articles and a lack  of realization that most issues are complex (and consequently that  important decisions require extensive investigation and deliberation),  panic had an oxygen rich atmosphere in which it could freely spread,  consuming our digital landscape. Changing how we think and how we act.</p>
<p>Lockdown  and social distancing negative consequences were merely an  afterthought. There was no large-scale discussion on the loss of quality  of life, nor about comparisons of COVID related risks to other dangers  we all take everyday or over years, unconsciously or not, whilst  participating in daily life. Sadly. with stay-at-home orders in place,  traditional locations of debate were void of the reason of their  existence – everyone was gone. We were left with a messy,  attention-craving, human-diminishing online arena. Our digital landscape  proved itself to be a very hostile place to discuss diverging opinions  and ideas. Perhaps that's a structural problem and the platforms we use  bring out the worst angels of our nature.</p>
<p>&rt;The  hot new technologies that emerged in the past decade or so are  particularly well suited to foster behavioral addictions, leading people  to use them much more than they think is useful or healthy. Indeed  [...] these technologies are in many cases <em>specifically</em>  designed to trigger his addictive behavior. Compulsive use, in this  context, is not the result of a character flaw, but instead the  realization of a massively profitable business plan.<br>
We didn't sign  up for the digital lives we now lead. They were instead, to a large  extent, crafted in boardrooms to serve the interests of a select group  of technology investors.</p>
<p>When  people ask me how could we have prevented such an exaggerated, lousy,  one-size-fits-all pandemic response, I frankly don't know; some key  ingredients to disaster were already there. Looking ahead, I'm fairly  certain of one of the problems we have to tackle – <strong><em>Human Downgrading</em></strong>, as Tristan calls it:</p>
<p>&rt;Humane  technology requires that we understand our most vulnerable human  instincts so we can design compassionately to protect them from abuse.</p>
<p>We  have to rethink out relationship with technology and personally  experiment with philosophies that aim to protect our individual  attention, such as the one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L-Uoo4VrIk">suggested</a>  by Cal Newport, Digital Minimalism. It is clear by now that digital  technologies have a strong and growing impact on important global  events. Going forward, let's grow awareness of this issue and design  technology that supports what we value most.</p></p>
