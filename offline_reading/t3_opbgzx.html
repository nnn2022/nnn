    <strong>Diary Of A Conspiracy Theorist - July 22 2021</strong>
    <p><p>A brief round up of some of the more sane &amp; life-affirming stories in the news this week;</p>
<p>Australia, chasing the pipedream of Zero-Covid, sends <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/australias-covid-19-lockdowns-expand-as-delta-variant-spreads-2490410">millions into lockdowns for a handful of cases</a>, with the media stressing that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_Tt2BGZS_g">nobody should talk to anyone they know</a>, under any circumstances, whilst continually pushing mass vaccination as the only way out of the hellscape caused entirely by Covid, with no influence at all from corrupt politicians &amp; corporations with a raging hardon for profit, control &amp; public misery.</p>
<p>The UK announced it's <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/07/19/vaccine-passports-boris-johnson-drops-carrot-picks-stick/">plan to introduce vaccine passports</a> for nightclubs in a last-ditch effort to coerce the younger generation of idiots into joining ongoing clinical trials in exchange for the ability to punch each other on a dancefloor after doing copious quantities of cocaine in a bathroom stall with shit smeared up the walls.</p>
<p>The globalist <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/03/health/unvaccinated-variant-factories/index.html">media continues to dehumanise</a> everyone not tripping over themselves to be injected with an experimental mRNA shot and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/los-angeles-county-new-la-mask-mandate-reinstated-indoors-all/">LA reintroduces mask mandates</a> whilst ensuring the public knows <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/op2oqw/los_angeles_suffers_40_increase_in_covid_cases_in/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">who to vilify for it's lack of freedoms</a>...</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an entirely different reality, Jeff Bezos journeyed to the edge of space in a dick-shaped rocket, then, on successful return, unironically reaffirmed his <a href="https://www.axios.com/bezos-space-flight-climate-change-cd9e2c36-63d2-4dcd-a4b5-94c0cb03a896.html">commitment to preventing climate change</a> whilst looking like the villain in a Brokeback Mountain/Star Trek crossover episode.</p>
<p>Bezos advised of the necessity for humans to move their polluting industry into space to protect Earth's atmosphere; however, we are yet to adequately measure how pioneering commercial, almost-space-flight is helping to achieve that goal.</p></p>

        <p>This is a beautiful time capsule of a post. </p>
<p>It looks almost exactly like something someone would have written about their predictions a year and a half ago hoping it would become satire and irrelevant in the future. </p>
<p>Life’s been so crazy lately, I didn’t even know about Bezos in space. </p>
<p>This life is becoming all of my greatest fears. Wow.</p>
