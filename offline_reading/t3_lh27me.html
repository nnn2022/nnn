        <p>Bravo! I’m in BC but the stream I was watching was Toronto area and the commercials were disgusting. “stay home until all of us are vaccinated.” How about you go fuck yourself?</p>

        <p>I don’t understand why people are thinking that once everyone is vaccinated that it will all go away. You can still get and transmit it after being vaccinated. It just doesn’t make sense to me. What’s the point of the vaccine?</p>

        <p>There is none, that’s why that commercial is even more dark than what it seems. They say it’s just until we’re all vaccinated (which is next to impossible by itself), but then cases won’t change presumably, or the new variants, etc. so in other words, were supposed to stay home indefinitely... that’s what that commercial is saying.</p>

        <p>Recall what happened with my step daughter last March. Mid week during her spring break during her 8th grade year, the governor of AZ called for a closure of restaurants at 8pm on a Wednesday night. As soon as I got home from work, we all jumped on our bikes and rode to happy hour at our favorite sushi place, for the last time. </p>
<p>4 days later, her school was closed. Indefinitely. She never got to see 98% of her friends ever again.</p>
<p>We've since moved, and she's yet to actually start her freshman year of high school on campus. </p>
<p>Fuck the government</p>

        <p>No, what we think is that the irrational and dumb lockdown of perfectly healthy people to protect those who are already on the verge of death or are unhealthy is just ridiculous. You’re throwing away the lives of people who are the future of society to save those who are at the end of their long and hopefully happy lives anyways. Funny you mention “let that old bitch die” because if I recall correctly I’ve seen many people who are insane over COVID say that we should die whilst claiming to care about saving lives. Protect the vulnerable, optional vaccine, open everything.</p>

        <p>We protect the vulnerable by washing hands, wearing masks and staying socially distanced. And that means lockdown because average morons can't be trusted to do 'the right thing'. And we still get selfish whiners what want to twist or outright deny science because they're being inconvenienced for once in their lives.</p>
<p>Half the people in here are willfully ignorant and the other half just don't give a shit. Both are spreading lies and misinformation. If you want the honest truth, most here have either been suckered in to this by propaganda or they are too damn dumb to realize they're still in a cult.</p>

        <p>Total false equivalence here.</p>
<p>Sure I care, but how is that relevant to this discussion about a VIRAL PANDEMIC? I couldn't do anything about cancer or an accident or a suicide (sorry for your loss on all accounts). I can do something about not spreading a deadly virus though and so can you. That's the point. If you eant to convince people you are right and not a crackpot it helps to not use logical falacies like false equivalence, appeal to emotion and hyperbole.</p>

<p>Masks aren't needed in the first place.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/mobile/news/asymptomatic-transmission-of-covid-19-didnt-occur-at-all-study-of-10-million-finds?fbclid=IwAR0AGG3xmf8G3tYbPL5Kpk6L5OHp8kGd7BDueemZnuidKgPu8UbjuSSGCKI&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 didn’t occur at all, study of 10 million finds</a></p>

<p>Even so, they're ineffective.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/faq.html">Cloth face coverings may provide reassurance to others in public settings and be a reminder of the need to maintain social distancing. However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That’s an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3676570">Occupation, living in apartment versus a house, and wearing a facial mask outside work increased probability of COVID-19 infection.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4420971/">Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.</a></p>

<p><strong>Interview with Michael Osterholm</strong></p>

<p>Note: The interview with Michael Osterholm is probably the best starting point for persuading doomers that masks are useless.  For those of you who don't know, Osterholm is actually one of Biden's COVID advisers now.  But about seven months ago, before the science behind masks became politicized, Osteholm explained in detail why masks are largely useless.</p>

<p>Note: This is probably the highest quality study done on masks in 2020.  And it shows that masks do not protect the wearer.</p>

<p>Note: Published in one of the oldest and most prestigious medical journals in the world.  Key quote: "We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection."</p>
<p>And no, at worst it's not an inconvenience. It's dangerous.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/04/150422121724.htm">The widespread use of cloth masks by healthcare workers may actually put them at increased risk of respiratory illness and viral infections and their global use should be discouraged, according to a UNSW study.</a></p>
<p>Masks aren't needed, don't work, and at worst make you sick with bacterial pneumonia which has the ability to give you lasting lung damage.</p>
<p>Anyone saying to wear a mask is anti Science, and a threat to society.</p>

<p>That's false. Masks do not filter outgoing air. At most you're rerouting the virus. You're not stopping it. Many of the studies above show that.</p>

<p>I guess the CDC is anti Science.</p>
<p>&rt;What of the other parts? Social distancing? Washing hands? You dont have a giant wall of text 'debunking' those? </p>
<p>You're free to stay away from others if you don't want to get sick, and no one here is saying not to wash your hands. Morso, neither of those things are enforced by law.</p>
<p>&rt;Curious that this sub seems to solely focus on the mask.</p>
<p>Because in many places the mask is legally required in public even though they don't work. </p>
<p>&rt;Half of your sources up there are from clearly bullshit outfits that I wouldn't trust to tell me the sky was blue.</p>
<p>Damn near all of them are direct links to studies. </p>
<p>&rt;It's willful delusion because you all are scared and being told to do something to benefit others instead of solely thinking about yourselves for once and your brain just can't handle it. </p>
<p>Masks don't work. There's 0 reason to enforce them at all. The fact you think this is about anything else, and have to start throwing names around goes to show how little of a point you have.</p>
<p>&rt;Stop whining and cherry picking from sources that fit your narrative. Stop denying science. </p>
<p>The science shows masks aren't needed, don't work, and at worst are harmful.</p>

        <p>Then why even try to use CDC as a source if they are 'corrupted'? That doesn't make any sense to me. Who's strawmaning now?</p>
<p>And I'm sorry I called you a libertarian, clearly you are a canadian fascist, judging from your comment history. My bad.</p>

        <p>I didn't. I used NPR using the CDC, who made the claim that masks protect the wearer. The thing you said no one says.</p>
<p>If anything this should prove to you that the CDC is full of shit. As only someone completely full of shit would think that the mask protects them.</p>
<p>It's hilarious you think I'm a fascist. The Nazis were auth centre bud. I'm right wing.</p>

        <p>Debate what? You people are looney toons. You cherry pick 'science' to fit your warped narrative. The more time you waste replying to me is one less moment you have to spread this crap to others.</p>
