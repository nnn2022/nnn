    <strong>Does anyone else find it slightly unusual how much the COVID experts in the United States flip flop and change their minds so often ?</strong>
    <p><p>Like in March of last year,Dr. Fauci claimed that masks wouldn't be necessary when the pandemic first started. Then,around september or october I believe,he suggested that people should wear TWO masks or maybe even more. Why do they change their minds so easily and why can't they decide what they want us to do ?</p></p>

        <p>They at first were worried that doctors wouldn't have enough so they told people not to wear them.</p>
<p>Now, they're struggling getting everyone vaccinated so they throwing the no-mask out as a carrot, and also they want the economy better before the mid-term elections and need to open up now.</p>
<p>They're scum. Their motivations are never pure.</p>

        <p>This is the Aquarian Age. The spirit of Janus rules. Janus was a 2 faced entity that can not be trusted. All of this contradictory information for the last year has been in homage to the cosmological times we have entered. This is esoteric folks, not just physical. The people running this thing are sick, twisted people. "As above, so below". They take that shit seriously.</p>

        <p>That last sentence is where it's at.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter if you believe in a God, gods, or are atheist. Doesn't matter if you believe in a flat earth, ball earth, hollow earth, or donut earth. Doesn't matter if you believe spirits are real or not. If you know that the people who have so much power over us adhere to a certain belief, you can have a bit more foresight and recognize more context surrounding what they do.</p>

        <p>So true. These people are driven by the stars and their love of Lucifer, the "Light Bearer". They don't care if you're an atheist. Hell, they WANT you to be one because then you are far from ever being a threat in the realm they play in.</p>

        <p>Because they’re not guided by science, they’re guided by polls. Fauci is a talking head that looks the part, that’s why he gets trotted out when paranoia has ramped up and the public needs a reassuring voice (HIV, Swine Flu, Ebola, now “Covid”...Aka flu). The messaging changes as it needs not to protect or educate, but to manipulate policy depending on what politicians need at any given time. Science on things such as masks or lockdowns has remained consistent for decades, as it is based on actual data instead of anecdotal bs.</p>
