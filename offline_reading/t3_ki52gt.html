    <strong>When my grandmother died from influenza</strong>
    <p><p>-Nobody bothered trying to figure out how she might have gotten infected. It's part of life and taken for granted that viruses circulate among people and we don't try to shift blame.</p>
<p>-She wasn't brought to the hospital. She had dementia, COPD and lived in a nursing home, which is where she received treatment and died. You don't force someone through the misery and medical theatre of ending up on a ventilator who doesn't have that much time left anyway.</p>
<p>-The whole family got to say farewell to her at the nursing home, including all her elderly sisters who were at high risk of getting infected themselves.</p>
<p>-All the Godforsaken American dorks who complain that SWEDEN IS EUTHANIZING COVID PATIENTS ZOMG don't seem to realize that this goes on all the time in nursing homes in many European nations. If someone lives in a nursing home and has no meaningful chance of recovering from a condition, then they're given treatment aimed at minimizing pointless suffering. </p>
<p>My other grandmother also died in a nursing home a few years ago. They stopped feeding her during the last few days of her ailment, which was very upsetting for my father, but not some sort of unique COVID predicament. That's <a href="https://www.trouw.nl/nieuws/dit-is-het-normale-stervensproces~b6856a6a/">just the way things work here</a>, I have colleagues who have similar stories. They could theoretically extend the life of the patients a bit by artificially feeding them, but they simply don't do that.</p>
<p>You might not like it and that's your right, this is inevitably a controversial issue, but this is simply how things work in many secularized Northern European nations. We don't have a lot of Intensive Care capacity either, for the simple reason that we don't painstakingly try to extend every life in the manner that some more conservative European countries would do.</p></p>

        <p>When a loved one dies, it sometimes feels unfair that everyones worlds continue turning whilst yours has stopped. Like the poem 'stop the clocks'. </p>
<p>But the fact is that it cant. I'm sure that if I lost a loved one to covid, my mindset would change somewhat. We are after all, malliable and hugely shaped by our experiences.  </p>
<p>HOWEVER. Knowing what I know now, having had friends and family members close to suicide and divorce, in complete despair and self hatred for even questioning that some measures don't make sense, demonising people who oppose lockdowns will never fully make sense to me. It's too cruel.</p>

<p>FAKE NEWS CONSPIRACy THEORY</p>
<p>COVID is the only thing that people die from any more, especially grandmas.  Even if they died 20 years ago, that is still retroactively changed to a COVID death.  It's called Pre-COVID syndrome, look it up, it's S C I E N C E.</p>

<p>Actually, when the body is shutting down at a certain point food actually becomes a hindrance. Dying people don't feel hunger. I learned this when my mom died and I thought it was so cruel that they kept food from her, but a doctor explained it simply: "her body just doesn't need food anymore."</p>
<p>My grandma died of pneumonia in a nursing home and no one gave a shit.</p>
<p>Most doomers don't understand that many older people value the quality of life they have left, not quantity.</p>

        <p>Had a conversation this morning with my spouse that the elderly would definitely prefer to see loved ones and get covid than live for a few more years without seeing loved ones and not getting covid. It’s most certainly about quality not quantity.</p>

        <p>My roommate said their grandma caught covid, she has a horrible respiratory comorbidity and is...92. I am sorry man, your grandma is gonna die. Last year I lost 2 grandparents and I was extremely sad about it, and I moved on. It's almost like...this is how life works. Her voice was all sad and self righteous and I just knew in her head she thought it was "people like me" who are gonna kill her. In any other year I would never think to blame someone for killing my grandparents, like some petulant child who can't accept normal life occurrences. It's like telling a child their dead pet is on a farm now bc they can't handle the idea of death. </p>
<p>Relatives die every year, grow up and get over it. You know how many young homeless women I see every day now? All so you can feel a little better about grandma? First. World. Problems. Living in child like delusions about how humans can magically destroy viruses. Most people are just trying to afford food for the week. Stop making them suffer more and focus on your own damn life. No one is dying more than prior years, all the open states and countries are fine... grow up.</p>

        <p>Last year a close family member died of a brain aneurysm at 37. It was pretty instant and he was away for work, so no one was with him. He has 2 very young kids and it was really devastating for all of us. We did get together a lot before though, for Christmas, we took our kids to Disney, spent a week with the entire family at an Airbnb in Aspen a few months earlier... I keep thinking about what if it happened this year? How many times has this happened to other people this year except they don’t have any recent memories of time spent together? Perfectly healthy people can just die at any time. It’s not just “one Christmas”, what if it’s the last Christmas? How is any of this worth it?</p>

        <p>We stop feeding people when they can't eat without choking, it means death is imminent. They usually aren't hungry at that point.</p>
