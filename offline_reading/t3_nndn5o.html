        <p>Unfortunately, once they have this in place they'll move to restricting travel inside the country.  We are going to have a dystopian police state like Israel imposes on Gaza.  Complete with checkpoints and walls all over the place.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs worth noting that these comments have since been clarified / walked back. Nobody ever said ‚Äúno vaccine, no travel,‚Äù at least not in the U.S. The U.S. doesn‚Äôt currently have a Covid-19 vaccine requirement to enter or exit the country (in fact, even fully vaccinated citizens need to show a very recent negative test or paperwork proving recovering from Covid within three months before entering the U.S. - learned that after booking tickets to return to my other country of citizenship for two weeks). And, the federal government has repeatedly said that they will require no such thing, they will not say ‚Äúvaccine or bust.‚Äù </p>
<p>But, the U.S. also cannot speak for other countries, and other countries might choose to implement Covid-19 vaccination requirements. Apparently, as clarified, these statements meant that systems to verify vaccination status for travelers traveling to foreign countries are being considered, so that Americans can travel without delay or too much bureaucracy to countries who do have vaccine requirements in place. And if you‚Äôve actually had to travel recently or plan to travel, you can probably see the merit in having a streamlined process, a single set of universal documents at your disposal to evidence your vaccination or negative test status.</p>
<p>I do agree that Mayorkas statements were confusing, and I can see how they could be taken to mean many different things, and he didn‚Äôt mention the caveats that seem to be pretty important here...but with the added context, there‚Äôs really no reason to freak out or assume that the U.S. will be requiring proof of vaccination for international or domestic travel and denying it to unvaccinated people. Has anyone here actually been denied travel within the U.S or denied travel abroad <em>by</em> the U.S. due to vaccination status? Or anything else based on vaccination status, for which a negative test result or an exemption didn‚Äôt suffice? Probably not. So let‚Äôs not put the horse before the carriage by becoming fearful of something that hasn‚Äôt happened. It‚Äôs likely that, while the pandemic is still occurring, negative test results will be just as if not <em>more</em> sufficient than proof of vaccination. I repeat - proof of vaccination gets you <em>nothing</em> when trying to re-enter the U.S. Let‚Äôs not lose perspective here, folks.</p>

        <p>Hey, thank you for your well-thought out comment, and for sharing your personal experience with traveling between countries. And thank you for clarifying all of those details too. A lot of them I didn‚Äôt know - like I didn‚Äôt know vaccinated people had to still show proof of a negative test, or that the comments have since been walked back. I appreciate your perspective and insight. I definitely find that I can get lost in the anxiety &amp; fears of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs,‚Äù so your comment brought a lot of much-needed perspective. :)</p>

        <p>It's beautiful, true, but so are so many other places. the mentality of America (even before all this) is def something to get away from sometimes, at least to see how much better life can be in a country where there is no shame in not making millions. That's my favorite thing about much of Eastern Europe: few people make piles of money, but it's not the goal. Time with family, a simple flat in a block, and enjoying life (working to live not living to work) and not defining yourself by a job is great. America is a beautiful country but there are some very ugly cultural things. As there are in every country, of course.</p>
