    <strong>We are here because someone we know is deeply suffering for lockdowns' collateral effects, some of our friends killed themselves, people that we know have lost lives, and we are not conspiracy theorists.</strong>
    <p><p>People can't accept the fact that either us or someone else we know is deeply suffering for these lockdowns.</p>
<p>They call us selfish, yet they've never asked or questioned why do people feel like this.</p>
<p>We are suffering great collateral damage, and all other people can't give two shits about.</p>
<p>Because it is not 'hip' 'trend' or 'fashionable' or virtue signaling and Instagram likes worth, to defend and protect thousands if not millions of people suffering because of this.</p>
<p>The media has got them hard, so hard they can't even listen to the hypocrisy of their own words.</p>
<p>You tell them that thousands of people are killing themselves, they call you an idiot.</p>
<p>You show them the data, they don't care.</p>
<p>The brainwashing is deep and real and we gotta stand strong for fighting for our own rights to speak and stand up freely against these abuses and oppression.</p>
<p>We are not alone. You are not alone.</p>
<p>It does take an empty shell unempathetic person to ride with the pro lockdown wave after 10 months of lies, cover ups, abuses.</p>
<p>To not care about millions of suffering people while pretending that they do. </p>
<p>To not care about your suffering so they can feel safe. </p>
<p>Ditch your social media, it will make you feel better.</p>
<p>People are only assholes on the Internet, they will hardly voice those words in public or in person.</p>
<p>The virtue signalling is too hard, and so many teenagers minds have been spoiled and broken.</p>
<p>They want to turn the world into an empty shell, devoid of any meaning, but we won't let them.</p>
<p>We are the majority, not like the media is trying to tell you, that we are a small percentage. </p>
<p>Speak with people in person, in the street, all of them are against this technocratic medical fascist regime.</p>
<p>The ones speaking and insulting on reddit and other social media are the ones that had no life prior to this, and you won't meet them ever in the street because are too recluse and cowards to even get out of their door.</p>
<p>If you even had a glimpse or a resemblance of a life before 2020,you wouldn't be spouting this shit and you'd be fighting to get it back.</p>
<p>You'd have enough life experience to understand what this is all about. </p>
<p>Its time that we realise.</p>
<p>Power to you, my friends, keep on going, keep on strong, keep believing that we will win, don't be hard on yourself and dont put yourself down, that is how they want you. Weak and doomer and alone. </p>
<p>Let's do this. Together. For real. </p>
<p>Much love.</p></p>

        <p>Right? I'm feel like I'm a fucking idiot half of the time for believing that these lockdowns are beyond inhumane and have gone on for too long. It's usually met with some anecdotal story of "But I'm finding myself and although it has been difficult, I think it's a necessary sacrifice."   </p>
<p>In another thread people are talking about how Bell Palsy is an appropriate risk for the vaccination... Like, are we the crazy ones? I know we're not mentally weak people but when others have no issue adjusting to a sick world - the sane people come off as lunatics.</p>

        <p>It may be a "necessary sacrifice" for some aging millennial in their 30s, but I have a life to live still. I want to experience my last year of highschool, and I don't want to sit in front of a computer for college.</p>

        <p>That's not what I was trying to do, and I apologize if it came off that way. But I have no doubt that the younger someone is, the worse this will affect them in the long term. I think of all the really little kids who aren't even gonna get to have a solid foundation due to this shit.</p>

        <p>As an aging millennial in my 30s, I fucking hate this shit and so do a lot of my aging millennial friends. I promise we’re not all like that, but I also have no desire to ever talk again to a lot of people I used to respect after they did nothing but post mask and social distancing memes for the last year. If 2020 has any silver lining it’s made me realize who I don’t want to be friends with.</p>
<p>Edit: I don’t blame you for being pissed off though, my generation is incredibly fucking stupid and I’m sorry on its behalf</p>

        <p>Yep, sometimes I feel we’re the crazy ones but we’re not. They’re the wrong ones for stopping everyones lives over this <em>indefinitely</em>. 2 weeks of lockdowns and masks OK. One month OK. But longer than that? It makes no sense, we’ve seen that things haven’t changed even with harsh lockdowns and mask mandates. It’s all incredibly unfair and harmful, especially seeing that so many developing countries in Africa for example have still got on as normal.</p>

        <p>People considered me weird back in march for pointing out when the Japanese were put into camps by the US government and stuff like that is why I'm very suspicious about all this.  Now the 14 days to flatten the curve are creeping close to 14 months and were being told there's a second strain of the big bad rona. People need to stop complying. If 1 business refuses to comply they can be harrassed. If 100 refuse to comply we all are much more powerful. Our society really needs to remember the government works for us. We don't work for them.</p>

        <p>Last year my grandma died. My mother and aunt were dependent on her, and with her gone and without any inheritance to speak of, my uncle took them in. He rents, and had to ask his room mates to find somewhere else to live. I've been helping out how I can the past year, but the brunt of the financial burden is falling on him. Well, he's been unemployed for coming on two months now and he wasn't seen one unemployment check yet. When I came over to shovel his driveway he was in a bad way. He flat out said to me "if I had a gun I'd shoot myself". I wrote him a check for a thousand dollars, hopefully that will relieve some of the pressure. But if this goes on I don't know what do to, as I can't afford to to that every month.</p>
