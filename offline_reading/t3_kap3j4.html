        <p>The plan is to destroy ALL small businesses and the economy at large. If the middle class still exists, even at a tiny amount, the lockdowns and restrictions WILL continue.</p>

        <p>I can't get behind you on that. I still have no reason to think that the various officials aren't acting in good faith, but just incredibly misguided.</p>

        <p>Here's some food for thought:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why shut down small businesses and outdoor dining, but keep big box stores open?</li>
<li>How come Amazon gets to continue to operate unfettered? Aren't workers handling thousands of packages every day?</li>
<li>Why did the bailouts help BigCos, but fail the small businesses? (look at who actually got the PPP loans)</li>
<li>Why continue testing using PCR at high cycles, when the research has shown this is picking up dead viruses and other shit as positives?</li>
<li>If they are acting in good faith, how could they justify shutting down people's jobs, but continue to pull their salary?</li>
<li>Why is Wal-Mart allowed to sell non-essential goods, but small businesses that sell the same goods are forced to close or under massively heavy restrictions?</li>
<li>Why did they make all these crazy expensive requests for restaurants (plastic barriers, tents, thermometers, disposable menus), just to still shut down the restaurants?</li>
<li>Why did they disallow evictions, but provide no relief to landlords? Surely they would know that massive landlord companies will survive, but small landlords won't.</li>
<li>How come none of these people pushing lockdowns ever talk about the economic consequences? If it was in good faith, wouldn't they also be discussing what the economic impacts are?</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether they even are misguided, acting in good faith or not, almost does NOT matter. If I think I am healing you by stabbing you in the stomach over and over, and every time you say stop, I stab harder, who cares what my motives are?</p>
<p>NEVER judge politicians by their words. Judge them by their actions. Their actions have an outcome that could not be clearer. The outcome is small business and middle class destroyed, with massive companies reigning supreme.</p>

<p>If efverything was in good faith, why would they rabidly go after anyone who is "contra" and cry "conspriracy!", regardless of how established an expert they are or how sensible their ideas are?</p>

        <p>Because (A) he refused to resign over it, and (B) nobody in the legislature was willing to make moves to remove him for it. Thus, Northam is not going anywhere until his term is up.</p>
