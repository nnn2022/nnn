    <strong>So much has changed in just over a year. There will be no "going back to normal" as it no longer exists</strong>
    <p><p>I don't mean this in a scary way (though it may be intimidating if you don't like change) but there has been a huge evolution of energy and we will not be seeing "life as we knew it" return; we are beyond that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So many people have decided to make changes in their lives over the past 14 - 16 months and it is not time to be asking for a return to the way things were, but to embrace the changes humanity has chosen to make.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you keep an eye open for them you may see them.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has been a huge blessing in disguise as it allowed people (as well as gave them a kick in the butt) to finally have the time, and make the time to look at their lives instead of constantly distracting themselves.</p>
<p>It allowed them time to be introspective instead of them being able to brush off thoughts about their lives, and finally they had a chance to ask themselves what they really wanted, and so many made life changing decisions, so there will never be going back to normal.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely!  We always go forward- we’re never going back to a pre 9/11 world, pre-Nazi etc</p>
<p>So of course we can’t undo the last 1.5 years</p>
<p>But we can and will regain our freedom</p>

        <p>Not to be a bummer, but no, we won't. We may be permitted a few privileges, but what's lost is GONE. We'll just get used to it &amp; call what we are permitted as "freedom".</p>
