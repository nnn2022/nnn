    <strong>Covid propaganda ruined my favorite rock star; how did your favorite athlete/celebrity hold up?</strong>
    <p><p>Been listening to KISS since I was a small child thanks in no small part to my dad who saw them live in the 70's at their peak (Alive! II tour). They're a great (if juvenile) band with an extensive catalog of music spanning a ton of rock sub-genres. Some of it is really good. Some of it is really bad. That's the fun of it.</p>
<p>I never thought of Paul Stanley as an idol but I appreciated that he wasn't like most rock stars. His autobiography is a genuinely good read; managed to stay out of hard drugs and pedophilia, wrote hit songs in a number of different genres, settled down with a wife and kids, and even did some charity work for a cause that actually mattered to him on a personal level. Of all the 70's rock stars, he's probably the "cleanest" in terms of personal issues.</p>
<p>KISS was in the middle of their final tour when covid hit and postponed everything. </p>
<p>The guy now has so little to do because the band was <em>everything</em> to him, that most of his social media is just mask propaganda and yelling at Trump. A sizeable chunk of the replies to his tweets are bots, with account names like Kevin30103050401 (for example) and whose post histories are also nothing but mask propaganda and Biden propaganda.</p>
<p>It's insufferable, especially when other band members used the lockdown as a creative outlet; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kulicknet/videos">their guitarist from the 80's for example will reminisce about old tours or do playthroughs of obscure songs.</a></p>
<p>How did your favorite athlete or celeb hold up? Have they too been turned into insufferable losers shilling for mask mandates?</p></p>

        <p>I mentioned this in an earlier post today in fact.</p>
<p>Avenged Sevenfold.</p>
<p>They won't even go into the studio to record because they're such cowards. Try and right that in your mind because I sure can't. Artists everywhere are recording. Just in the last few days there was an interview with the lead where we was carrying on about BLM and being 'on the right side of history' which much as with 'We're in this together' is a statement that makes me want to violently puke every time I hear it. Oh our string section can't be safe and our mixer is old and so on. I'm sorry you pussies but when did mixing stop being in it's own booth all on it's own? Just ahhhh! </p>
<p>Leftist shit heads and cowards. That's what's become of my now former favorite band.</p>

        <p>I listen to a lot of lesser known bands (though within their own genre they tend to be fairly well known) and most of them canâ€™t afford to circlejerk over the current situation.</p>
<p>Haken, for example, is a UK-based band with some phenomenal talent, and they have taken on as many local touring opportunities as possible, as well as online performances and other events, just to make ends meet. Theyâ€™ve chosen as neutral a stance as possible, because they just want back on the road after cutting short their 2020 tour. Ironically, they also dropped an album in mid-2020 entitled Virus â€” though unaffiliated with the pandemic (they wrote it during 2019) it was quite good timing.</p>
<p>Most of the other bands I listen to have similar stories. Some have reworked old songs, covered other songs in their own style, or written new songs and recorded them with what limited studio time they can find. None of them have spoken out much in either direction, and all of them are eager to perform together again.</p>

        <p>A few years ago, I got into an argument with myself (sometimes it's the only reliable way to find good conversation) about which System Shock game was better.  I decided to go back and replay both, and then got into a discussion online in which I praised the work of Terri Brosius, who voiced the villain of both games (and did some writing and level design work, too).  His response was a pause, followed by "have you read her Twitter?".  I said no, as I had the intelligence to avoid social media; he told me to check it out anyway.  So I did, and hoo-boy!  Trump, Trump, Trump Trump Trump Trump Trumptrumptrump..."  It's perfectly reasonable to dislike the man, even vehemently, but she apparently thinks (or thought) he's the Antichrist.</p>
<p>Since then, I've made it a point to avoid looking to closely into those whose work I enjoy.  I actually hadn't thought about that in a while, but I imagine it's especially psychologically draining in light of something so objective.</p>
<p>[For the record, the superior System Shock game is whichever one I've played more recently; both are excellent.  If you haven't played them (and are into video games, natch), I'd highly recommend playing both;  for their role in gaming history, if nothing else.  In particular, playing System Shock and reflecting that it was released <em>less than a year after DOOM</em>.]</p>
