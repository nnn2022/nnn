    <strong>My partner is getting the vaccine tomorrow...</strong>
    <p><p>I’m very anxious about him getting this potentially dangerous injection. But my whole philosophy is to let people live their lives as they choose. I do not want to tell him what to do or do anything to control him. He’s an adult and I’ve already expressed to him my feelings about the vaccine, and why I have them.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the day he gets it and I feel sick about it. He’s young and healthy and we don’t live or interact with any “at risk” people. In my opinion there is no logical reason for him to take a risk with this experimental treatment. But at this point I can’t do anything without pushing him away. I feel stuck.</p>
<p>How do you deal with this without destroying relationships? A part of me feels like this is an ominous sign of our differences. I don’t want to see any division in my life, especially as a result of our government/media propaganda. If I leave him then they win.</p>
<p>How do you move forward with someone that chooses subservience? How do you deal with the fear of them losing their health as a consequence of this? How do you not blame yourself if things go wrong?</p></p>

        <p>I begged my husband to just wait to get the vaccine if he wanted it so bad. We are also very healthy, active, young, and there was no real reason why he needed to get the vaccine for himself. He felt pressured by family and colleagues to get it. I tried to show him articles and talk about how this is a gene therapy. He didn’t want to hear any of it. He called it all conspiracy, said he couldn’t trust my sources. Long story short, he goes for his second injection this evening and we are getting divorced. Not because of the vaccine but because we have chosen two very different sides. As far as the other commenter said regarding children - there is no telling how sperm will be affected, how future generations of that sperm will be affected, and it’s not a risk I’m willing to take. We were married six months before the world went into lockdown. We agreed to be partners in a very different world. It’s very sad and I’m totally heartbroken, but it is what it is. I can’t be with someone who walks through life blind and he can’t be with someone who is a radical conspiracy theorist, so there you have it.</p>

        <p>I feel you. 
Him and I are gay, so I’m not worried about sperm. But this has brought me to the conclusion that if I ever want to adopt kids it won’t be with him. The example he sets isn’t one I could excuse for a child. Maybe you dodged a bullet.</p>
<p>This situation is insidious on so many levels.</p>

<p>I am really sorry about this. I just don't get how a spouse wouldn't even spend at least 5 minutes to listen to the other partner's POV, even if they are CoNsPiRaCy ThEoRiEs.</p>

        <p>Eyes to see and ears to hear, brother. Some people don’t have them. The Shepherd calls and His sheep answer to the call of His voice. Not everyone decides to heed that call. It’s not my POV he denies but the Truth. It’s much bigger than the vaccine or “conspiracy theories” but the denial of a holy Truth to be sought at all. When one person walks in that light then the others who hide from it will naturally shirk away. His heart has been hardened by the light, like clay, like Pharaoh (so ironically during this time!). But as long as he is alive there is hope.</p>

        <p>No, we are both Jewish and we live in Israel. The Messiah is not accepted amongst Israeli Jews and he was raised ultra-orthodox so he really doesn’t want to hear about any of that at all.</p>

        <p>I have the utmost respect for you because if my husband was in the same place I'd file for divorce. I believe this is bigger than politics and agreements/disagreements. If shit hits the fan you need someone who saw through the farce all along. My husband refuses to vaccinate and so do I. We both see how world wide communism/fascism is rolling in. I told him we need to have a back up plan to run.</p>

        <p>I agree. That’s another reason why I’m respecting his decision. He thinks I’m crazy and still loves me, so I can’t let this change how I feel about him.</p>
<p>The thing is he isn’t even afraid of covid. He’s just getting it because a friend asked if he wanted to come get it with them. He’s getting it just because it’s the thing people are doing.</p>
<p>So it’s a weird situation for me to be in, as I’ve done so much thinking and research on this. I care so much and feel that there is significant long term risk here. It’s hard to keep my cool while secretly feeling panicked.</p>
<p>Also, i upvoted you. I think that is a great take and it helps. Thanks</p>

        <p>I think you should calmly voice your opinion to him. Tell him it’s ultimately his choice and you love him no matter what but to consider not doing it. Especially if you want to have kids one day, that’s a big reason not to jump the gun. Tell him the choice is his but to please consider your feelings too especially since he’s not afraid of covid. He can still go with his friend or not go with his friend but he doesn’t need to get it. I don’t understand how people can do something extra, not “natural” to their body, especially after all the contradictions we hear. Idk if I make sense but it’s more normal not to get it than to get it. But people will get it to prevent something that we clearly know isn’t as deadly as they made it out to be.

        <p>It doesn’t make any sense. It’s mindless.</p>
<p>We’re gay so kids aren’t in the picture. But if I ever feel ready to adopt it won’t be with this person even though I love him. I can let things go when it only effects me but if I am responsible for a child I won’t back down. From all of this I know that him and I wouldn’t make a great team as parents.</p>

        <p>That was super respectful of you. I have done the same with my parents, just nodding and saying "ok" my mother was fine with the first one, the second made her extremly sick, but to her it was worth it so whatever. My father will be getting his soon too, along with basically everyone in my county because they have turned the shot into a Disney Land event with speaches, dancing, singing and bringing it to farm workers, turning the fair into a party of free vaccines. I just can not see how people don't see right through this b.s. I'm sure he will be ok, but I agree he shouldn't. I can't imagine being with someone who has such a different view on this than I do.</p>

        <p>Boy this is a tough one I really feel for you. I was just talking to someone about dating and I was saying that one of my stipulations for dating now would be I can't deal with men who are supportive of these lockdowns long-term and dont ask any questions at all. It's just a huge fundamental difference for me. I get it if you were on board with this for maybe the first couple of months, I'll give you that I was too. But once we got to a certain point if you're not curious about this and connecting the dots a little bit between all of these world events there's no way in hell I could have a long-term relationship with someone who doesn't have that Natural Curiosity about things and ask questions. I would also worry that if you're going to marry this person and you want kids with them there are probably going to be some huge difference is there too.</p>
<p>And of course I know this is going to sound horrible especially since I am someone who works in healthcare and I genuinely enjoy taking care of people but if this person was damaged by this vaccine and had long lasting effects which required me to take care of them I would absolutely not want to do it and I would be hugely resentful of it because they did this to themselves. I would be worried about having children with someone who took this vaccine if they were of childbearing years or younger guy. Who knows how it will affect reproduction. We don't know any of this stuff yet. I don't care if people take the vaccine I'm not judging those who do but for someone that close to me this is a huge fundamental difference.</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same way. Him and I were together before this all started. I’m not sure we would have matched if we met each other now. We get along great, but if I was dating now I’d be seeking someone that opposes this “new normal” shit.</p>
<p>And if the vaccine ends up being THAT bad and people are somehow handicapped by it, I won’t be taking care of anyone outside of my immediate family. I just couldn’t do it.</p>

        <p>My fiancé just got the second shot and she knows there is no way in hell I’m getting that that. It’s her choice.

<p>As far as the differences, embrace them. Allow each other to provide a perspective the other might not have, and be rational about said information. There’s nothing wrong with a difference in opinion, so long as your core values are close enough to being in line. Besides, if we are outcasts of society, they can do all the grocery shopping.</p>

        <p>No problem. It can be difficult when the people we love don’t see things the way we do, but stressing out about it is counterproductive and can drive a wedge between something positive. </p>
<p>When I get to stressing about things, I try to ask myself, “is there anything I can do about it?” If the answer is yes, good, no need to stress - just do what I can without overstepping boundaries.  If the answer is no, that sucks, but oh well, no need to stress - there’s nothing I can do about it.</p>

        <p>Hi. I wanted to comment because I went through the exact same thing.</p>
<p>I'm very anti all of this. My partner still got a vaccine anyways (we're both millenials and are very healthy, we never get sick).</p>
<p>I had to come to terms with the fact that they have free will just as much as I do, so I will let them be. Trust me, I made a huge fuss about all of this. But if they dont choose to listen, that's their choice.</p>
<p>Theres no need to blame yourself because it's their choice. </p>
<p>They're doing okay so far. And my condolences to you.</p>

        <p>Well we’re both dudes. </p>
<p>And honestly his subservience is unattractive in this regard.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’d blame myself, more like, I’ll think about how I could have just put intense pressure on him to not get the shot. He is the submissive one and it would work, but I don’t want a relationship where I’m making adult decisions for my partner. So I know I have the power to stop this, but it would make the relationship shitty. If we were married and there were kids involved I’d do whatever it takes but that’s not the case.</p>
<p>I think that making mistakes is the best way to learn, which is why I rarely intervene, but this situation is different. In a year I can’t be like, “told ya so,” as he’s violently shaking because he hasn’t gotten his monthly booster shot to support his artificially compromised immunity.</p>
<p>Idk man... it’s all fucked.</p>

        <p>There is probably nothing to be done. Especially with how much propaganda has been put out for the past year. If he is so dead set on it there is probably no changing his mind.</p>
<p>And should he get sick from it he chose to make the choice and accept potential risks. It's hard to see anyone near you on board with an experimental vaccine. At the very least I would be prepared in case he does get sick from the vaccine. Make sure he has any meds, foods and other stuff that could help him. I'm not saying that the vaccine will make him sick but it could not hurt to be prepared in case.</p>

        <p>Until we learn the long term effects it is an experiment. That is a basic principle of science.</p>
