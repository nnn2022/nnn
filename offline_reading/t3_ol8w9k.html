    <strong>Jab cards are meant to be falsified in order to roll out block-chain based health passports. Universal basic income will be tied to it and it will be welcomed. Here's why.</strong>
    <p><p>Before the G7 summit, an NGO called ID2020 that is funded by Microsoft and owns the technology called Good Health Pass, wrote a letter to the G7 leaders urging for the need to use this health passport.</p>
<p>After the summit, the Delta variant started to appear all over bringing in to the table the actual efficiency of the jabs and whether it is needed a third dose or not. What we are looking at really is an annual vaccination plan. It doesn't really matter if the original jabs are gonna be used or some new ones. The objective is getting the juice.</p>
<p>So right now we are witnessing the early stages for the coerced jabs and jabs-card to enter public places. Several countries are starting with these measures.</p>
<p>The cards, that are a piece of paper can be falsified very easily and that's the purpose of it. So the solution will be a block-chain based health passes. Since it's unique and digitized, it can be used to attach the universal basic income to that ID. How convenient.</p>
<p>I'll try to explain this part not being so technical. The US plays an important role in the global economy. Dollars are needed in a lot of countries and with the current inflation in the USA, government will rise the interest rate. This is not a guess, it will happen.</p>
<p>This affects the mentioned countries because it lowers the purchasing capacity of their national currency. So... an unstable economy  in the US due to inflation and an important part of the world affected by it will welcome free money handed out by governments with just one click. But it won't be given away easily. Naughty boys will have to behave.</p>
<p>Final questions is: fight that system or escape from it? Only a small amount of people have the luck to grow their own food so my suggestions is to carefully plan where to live. Western Europe is already leading the new normal and North America (US and Canada) are following. Australia and New Zealand too.</p>
<p>Forget about Asia. South Korea just joined the club and Japan... who knows. China... lol. The only hope is Latin America and Eastern Europe.</p>

        <p>The Petrodollar system is just global bullying. Either you use the FED conspiracy's currency or you will not get to have oil and an economy. The UBI will be even worse. Total control of every transaction. Total control over who gets to exist in the official economy.</p>
<p>There will also be another round of shock and awe soon, I think. After Cyber Polygon and the solar flair stuff, the stage is set for another false flag to advance this agenda.</p>
<p>They will show the masses how addicted they have become to the internet and electronics by shutting it all down for a bit and increasing pressure on the public that was taken hostage.</p>
<p>Escape the system. Build your own. Farm rice. Anything is better than this.</p>

        <p>US is still your best bet for avoiding the new normal, just stay in a red state. At least half the country won't put up with this nonsense in the long term. </p>
<p>Canada is already far lost, I would say way ahead of Western europe at this point. Australia has a lot of based people but eh who were the ones that gave away all their guns to the government.</p>

        <p>I clearly pointed out that UBI will be attached to the ID based on block-chain technology. Digital currency, specially issued by governments costs nothing to be "printed", but it will be given at a price: be obedient. What part you did not understand?  </p>
<p>Taxing big companies it's just a cover to make you happy. The taxation will automatically increase the price of their goods and services. This is it nothing new, if you increase their costs, they'll translate that to consumer prices.</p>

        <p>Yes, costs will increase. But less than the UBI that you get. As UBI is a measure of wealth redistribution. Everyone except the rich, is better of using such a system.</p>
<p>I completely understand that you don't get this, as it is very much ideal for the elite if the poeple that would most benefit from this, vote against their own interests.</p>

        <p>Listen, the one that does not gets it is you, and it's because you think economy it's just about money.  </p>
<p>If giving away money would have solved the poverty in the world then it would have been used centuries ago. You can have a lot of money, but if you can't access to basic needs you're still poor.  </p>
<p>During the WWII Germany bombed England with fake money. It's not my fault you repeat stupid things you hear yet don't understand.</p>

        <p>The economy is only about money yes. Goods and services with money as the intermediate factor. Also used as a storage of wealth.</p>
<p>Poverty could easily have been solved through redistributing wealth like it is solved in most countries except for the USA. There, a social welfare net exists that ensures that the only people who live on the street do that when they refuse all help. And even then, they still get help from time to time.</p>
<p>Yes, hyperinflation is only bad for the people that have a lot of money. It doesn’t matter for normal people. As they don’t have currency to  be devalued. </p>
<p>UBI is never about getting a lot of money, it will never make you rich but it will make you have enough to live. Which is redistributed from the wealth of the rich. No one loses except the rich, which most people are not.</p>

        <p>Congratulations for writing a convoluted first world Marxist essay, everybody that doesn't live in a shithole country likes these ideas, so I'll break it down.</p>
<p>&rt;The economy is only about money yes. Goods and services with money as the intermediate factor. Also used as a storage of wealth.</p>
<p>I can tell your a Marxist because you use words that does not mean anything. Money it's not  an intermediate factor. Elaborate. When you give away money like this, inflation goes up and the money they gave you has less purchasing capacity so storage of wealth is ruled out. Storing gas or lumber, for example, will be storing wealth because as times goes by the value of it goes up, contrary to the free money you have.</p>
<p>&rt;Poverty could easily have been solved through redistributing wealth likeit is solved in most countries except for the USA. There, a socialwelfare net exists that ensures that the only people who live on thestreet do that when they refuse all help. And even then, they still gethelp from time to time.</p>
<p>Since I moved out of the picture that wealth it's not about money. And you're here saying "redistributing wealth" and not "redistributing money" I'd like to thank you for proving my point that poverty it's not solved by giving away money, rather facilitating access to goods and services.</p>
<p>&rt;Yes, hyperinflation is only bad for the people that have a lot of money. It doesn’t matter for normal people. As they don’t have currency to be devalued.</p>
<p>Completely the contrary, inflation makes the poor poorer and the rich richer. Workers have a limited salary that's not indexed to inflation and as their currency is devaluated they can purchase less and when they spend that money on inflated prices they are financing the rich that sets the high prices due to inflation.</p>
<p>&rt;UBI is never about getting a lot of money, it will never make you rich but it will make you have enough to live. Which is redistributed from the wealth of the rich. No one loses except the rich, which most people are not.</p>
<p>Countries, nations, families and individuals will NOT prosper if they are just and only covering their basic needs.</p>
<p>You can leave now, good luck buddy.</p>

        <p>You say UBI, but are you sure its universally basic?</p>
<p>You dont think its problematic that those pushing for UBI these days are the biggest winners of the "old" system?</p>
<p>I might be willing to believe Klaus Schwab that he honestly tries for a better world. But to believe that he is doing so and at the same time backed by Monsanto, Blackrock and the likes...</p>
<p>UBI is a great concept for sure, but those who implement it, will make sure it will be the opposite of what it could be.</p>

        <p>Think about it for a second. It’s not possible to create any system where everyone gets the same amount of money where the rich benefit. </p>
<p>UBI is great for everyone except rich people, which is why it will never be implemented. </p>
<p>They have even convinced you to believe in a conspiracy theory where you vote against your best interest. This is literally what they want, for you to view a system that would be great for you as bad. The rich benefit and you get nothing.</p>

        <p>I know about UBI for quite some time. You are the first to claim that everyone will get the same amount and thats it.</p>
<p>Every other interpretation still has billionaires earning billions. It still has "educated" jobs earning more than "uneducated" ones. It still has football players earning millions.</p>
<p>So you tell me that the WEF clique is actually bad and they are pushing for UBI so I am against it because they are pushing it?</p>
<p>This would be something. But still, Im not anti because they are pushing it, Im anti because I dont believe it to be universal. For starters: No Vaccine - No UBI. But just read through the various agendas UN and WEF and the likes have, and then tell me that you honestly think they will pay you your money if you dont obliege by their rules. I doubt it. It will be a control mechanism in a world that offers no other possibilities but to play by their rules.</p>

        <p>I’m not sure you even get what UBI is. It is additional money that you get. Where everyone gets this same additional amount. That’s why it’s called UNIVERSAL. Sure some people earn more, because that is how it works, you are able to work to earn more money just like it is now. Which is totally unrelated to UBI.</p>
<p>The way this is paid is by taxing the rich for the extra amount, which is why everyone except the rich benefits, because everyone has more except the rich.</p>
<p>If you don’t event get what it is, then you also shouldn’t make a conspiracy post about it and certainly not advocate against your own interest. Except if you are super rich and if so, good for you.</p>
