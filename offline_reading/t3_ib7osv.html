    <strong>Had to unfollow one of my favorite Instagram accounts because they were constantly talking about the new normal, and it was wreaking havoc on my mental health.</strong>
    <p><p>I kid you not, one of her recent posts was about a conversation she had with her young daughter in which she asked the girl what she would think about having to wear masks for the next few years, and her daughter shrugged and was like, "I'd get used to it." And the mom thought that was totally cool and resilient of her! Another one of her posts was a quote about not fighting to keep the old way of life, but embracing the new. I wanted to barf ü§Æ </p>
<p>I have such respect for this person and really enjoy her photography, but I can't take this COVID crap anymore and how she's acting like her Melbourne "new normal" is totally fine and dandy, and the family is adjusting just fine. I mean, good for them if they're taking it well, but it's honestly so frustrating to see people treating this like it's not a big deal! Like it's just something we can and should accept as our new reality. I seriously want to be sick.</p></p>

        <p>I left instagram entirely because people I knew would never shut up about the new normal and the pandemic. Social media is one of the reasons why the hysteria is so big, so I'm trying to avoid it as much as possible.</p>

        <p>I too have done the same..don‚Äôt miss it one bit.  I now surround myself with people who are positive..uplifting and not afraid to stand their ground and continue to live the way we choose to. Stay off Instagram and vent on reddit where we are safe to express our views without being villafied and judged by those who are just controlling the narrative and or scared of being targeted and shunned .</p>

        <p>What an absolute idiot pretending anything about Melbourne right now is okay or <em>normal</em>, while children and adults are driven to self harm and suicide. What a selfish, out of touch person.</p>
<p>I'm over Australia. God damn Queensland is trying to be the "New New Zealand" and will keep their borders shut  until there is ZERO community transmission in other states. So forever? Since there will <strong><em>never</em></strong> again be zero SARS-CoV-2 cases. The new normal is that Queensland is it's own country?</p>
<p>This new normal shit is terrible for my mental health too.</p>

        <p>Just like those who are otherwise socially awkward....controlling with their children and partners and just plain old boring.  Many keyboard warriors and gamers who never want to leave their insulated small worlds to breathe fresh air and experience life outside of their virtual reality. They now feel empowered and for once are considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I am not judging these people truly but there are many like me that rely on true social physical connection to those I care about. Wanting to hug a friend or neighbor and being able to smile or taking off my mask to drink my coffee without being villafied.</p>

<p>This frustrates me as well. Even in these subs, I see this attitude of it not being a big deal. One comment read something like: "This will pass, even if it happens in 2025. Just take it easy, and wait. It'll be okay. :)" It just feels so incredibly dismissive of the harm and damage these restrictions are doing to many people. Can you imagine if we end up having to live like this until <strong>2025</strong>? Sure, "it'll be over" by then, but what's going to be left? This whole movement can't be about abiding and waiting, and settling for the "New Normal" until it ends. And who's to say that we won't lose a hell of a lot before then, too.</p>

        <p>It's really not very different from the sort of stuff the pro-lockdown crowd says: "Just be patient! It's only for a few months!", "Why can't you just chill, and watch Netflix until this is over?", "Stop being a big baby! The lockdown won't kill you!", and so on.</p>
