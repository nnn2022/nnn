<title>Double jabbed &amp; vax injured Clapton doesn't want to force ppl to take something that almost killed him which makes him an "anti-vaxxer"? Saying something racist in 1970 and since apologizing is not enough as well. But blackface PM Trudeau is totally cool. Cancel shilling for big pharma much, Reggie?</title>

        <p>Clapton’s vax injury (taking a double jab makes you an “anti-vaxxer” now??): https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/eric-clapton-slams-vaccine-propaganda-after-experiencing-disastrous-side-effects/ar-BB1gPT02</p>
<p>&rt;Legendary rocker Eric Clapton said he had a “disastrous” reaction to the COVID-19 vaccine and blamed “propaganda [that] said the vaccine was safe for everyone” after he was left fearing he’d “never play again.”</p>
<p>&rt;“I took the first jab of AZ and straight away had severe reactions which lasted ten days. I recovered eventually and was told it would be twelve weeks before the second one,” Clapton said in a letter to architect and anti-lockdown activist Robin Monotti Graziadei, which was shared with Clapton’s permission.</p>
<p>&rt;Clapton, who received the AstraZeneca shot in February, added that he was later offered the second dose after six weeks, which he accepted only because he had “a little more knowledge of the dangers.”</p>
<p>&rt;“Needless to say the reactions were disastrous, my hands and feet were either frozen, numb or burning, and pretty much useless for two weeks, I feared I would never play again,” Clapton wrote.</p>
<hr>
<p>Clapton apologized in 2018 for the racist comments he made in 1976 (45 years ago) while heavily under the influence of drugs and alcohol: https://www.the-sun.com/news/3327970/what-racist-remarks-has-eric-clapton-allegedly-made/</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>In 2018, the guitarist apologised and addressed his comments during a documentary on his life. He described himself at the time as having been a "full-tilt racist" and admitted: "I did really offensive things. I was a nasty person.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”I think it was based on the Arabic invasion. There was this sort of air of this in the early 70s. <strong>I’m not excusing myself. It was an awful thing to do.</strong>
I think it's funny actually."</p>
<p>&rt;He told the Daily Mail he was a "semi-racist" during his early career <strong>and is "so ashamed" of who he was.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Clapton battled drug and alcohol addiction during his career, which led to the breakdown of his marriages and strained his professional career.
He has now been sober for 30 years.</p>
<hr>
<p>Current Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau appered in blackface not once, but twice! Once in high school and again 20 years ago in 2001. He also apologized, but for some reason, never got the cancel treatment like Clapton did: https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-votes-2019-trudeau-blackface-brownface-cbc-explains-1.5290664</p>
<p>Maybe Reggie Watts only cancel shills on behalf of risky, experimental, billion dollar pharmaceutical interests?</p>

        <p>I adore Eric, I am also a person who has had several seasons of drug abuse, so I am biased. But what blows my mind is how little credence is given to anyone who did or said something in the midsts of heavy substance abuse. </p>
<p>When you are using any substance daily you will do &amp; say things that you are ashamed of when sober. Eric was abusing heroin as a rock star... If there was ever a combo where society should give a pass for self induced insanity, this is it...</p>
<p>And decades later after sobriety, after apologies the man went on to make music about Robert Johnson, made an album with BB King...If he was such a racist why do so many black musicians want to be a part of his Crossroads concerts for charity? Seriously, if Buddy Guy doesn't like you, he's not going to perform with you. These black musicians actually experienced extreme racism in the 50's &amp; 60's yet saw past his drug fueled comments and worked with him?
If he was so awful they would have not done that...</p>

        <p>With the Cult of the Mask and Vax Left - nothing you say or do is ever forgiven, apologizing for a genuine wrong just emboldens them to use it against you more, and no matter what apologies, reparations or forgiveness you may afford their way - they will never return.</p>
<p>Now with the weapon of social media, especially Discord and other, every word you say can and will be used against you into perpetuity. Past wrongs never forgiven, and mistakes made will be drummed up to use against you today.</p>
<p>Clearly this is 100% against a Christian mindset, and simply reflects the utter immorality, lack of ethics and care that our society has become. Perfect mindset for a Police and Surveillance State to operate in - fueled by a large portion of people.</p>
