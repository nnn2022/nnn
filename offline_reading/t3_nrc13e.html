    <strong>People who aren't afraid of the virus, but think everyone should get the vaccine AND wear masks after vaccine AND wear masks during ordinary flu.....</strong>
    <p><p>So I'd say the majority of Americans who are pro-mask are only pro-mask because of covid. They have no intention to keep wearing the masks forever, and most want to stop after getting their vaccine. There's a small portion that are terrified of the variants (<em>or want to virtue-signal really hard)</em> and so are wearing masks after vaccine. But the main driver is they themselves are TERRIFIED of getting covid (even if they are perfectly young and healthy) or they're terrified of giving it to an older relative. For everyone else in society, they think once they've had a chance to get a vaccine, it's on them if they die from being unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Now, when I talk to recent immigrants from places like India, China, Africa etc, it's very different. They're usually perfectly healthy and only a little afraid of covid for themselves, but are sooooo worried they're not going to be a "good citizen" and give the virus to someone else. So even after vaccination and surrounded by unmasked people, they always wear a mask themselves. It is literally a religion for them because they believe they've done their "good citizen" duty and can't understand why others are so selfish to not a wear a mask. </p>
<p>After having long conversations with these people, they: (1) brush aside all other side-effects of masks and lockdowns, only covid matters. (2) they think the Left doesn't worship anyone because they don't have Jesus like the Right does. So therefore the Left is sane and balanced and all of the experts agree with the Left. (3) anyone on the right is just confused because they're reading right-wing propaganda and they never hear the message on the Left <em>(even tho its shoved into our face by the mainstream news media and everything else in society every five seconds)</em>, and (4) people in countries like India etc aren't "educated" enough to make their own decisions, so it's good that Big Brother government cares about them and tells them what's best <em>(the implied notion was Americans, especially right wing Americans, are too uneducated to understand what's best for them. The right wingers have been given the wrong information)</em>. They claim this is not socialism nor communism, it's that the Right side of politics just has no compassion for immigrants and the poor, whereas the Left does.</p>
<p>I ask things like "are you planning to wear a mask during ordinary flu season?" And they say yes, yes they are. "Why? You're healthy and have no risk of dying of flu."  Response: "Because I might give the flu to someone else and they die."</p>
<p>I also ask stuff like "But you could accidentally kill someone just driving your car around?"</p>
<p>"I've taken all of the precautions I can while driving." <em>(In reality, this person speeds around like a demon in heavy city traffic. No, I don't think they've had an accident yet, but they're not driving grandma-slow in the name of "safety".)</em></p>
<p>Basically, you're a "selfish" person if you haven't taken all of the precautions possible by wearing a mask any time you are around other people who aren't part of your current social group, even during normal flu season. This person wasn't even sure if masks were super-effective, but as long as they were "a little" effective, it was worth wearing one. </p>
<p>Some of these mask covidians will quit wearing masks if one day CDC declares it "safe", but some will keep wearing masks because they don't "feel" like they're keeping others safe.</p>
<p>I've noticed that immigrants that come from countries with recent memories of communism (Romania etc) are much more afraid of government power and skeptical of covid. But in other countries where Big Brother government tells them what to do and they live in a society where "conformity to the group" is the highest honor, they are not skeptical at all and think the Right's fears of losing freedoms are totally overblown and are selfishly ignoring the real problem: protecting others from covid and all other diseases.</p>
<p>This is a total impasse. You cannot have a communist/socialist society and a libertarian society at the same time. There is literally nothing that can be mutually agreed upon.</p></p>

        <p>It's about control. When you give the government any control over you, its damn near impossible to get it back.</p>

        <p>I am here to learn and have an open conversation- i just want to make it clear i’m not sure if i agree on you but that’s why i’m asking about it so i can learn from another perspective. but why do you believe it’s a form of control? i think they were like ok the amount of people dying is insane and so we have to mandate masks to be able to stop people from dying. that seems reasonable to me. i’m not against capitalism, but isn’t forcing us all to commit to a 9-5 standard society control? if wearing a mask is control- why is it a negative one? why are we are focusing on it? they’re already controlling us are they not? i just don’t understand why everyone is so pressed about the masks being a form of control when it was able to protect people. i’m open to learn but that’s also where i’m coming from</p>
