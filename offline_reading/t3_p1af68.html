        <p>Big Oil and Big Pharma are one of the same. Governments worldwide relentlessly continue to protect, shield and defend the fossil fuel industry - an industry responsible for grotesque crimes against humanity. Don't even get me started on that.</p>
<p>Instead of being held criminally accountable (in a similar manner to Big Pharma), Big Oil continues to wreck havoc on our planet, regardless of the consequences. Profit is all that matters. Our lives don't.</p>
<p>We, or at least some of us, have been aware of the catastrophic effects fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial farming and exploitive resource extraction has on our planet for decades, yet nothing has been done. Just compare that to how covid has been dealt with. Again, why would governments hold Big Oil accountable when there is big money to be made?</p>
<p>The only reason the MSM and certain governments have begun to acknowledge the fact that anthropogenic climate change is real, is because big corporations, including Big Oil, are now jumping on the band-wagon and pretending to be climate champions, which is a total joke. Again, it is all about profit as usual.</p>
<p>I live in Norway, a country that openly pretends to be a "climate champion", yet they are literally expanding their oil drilling in the Arctic. These governments and corporations don't care about the environment one bit. Power hungry hypocrites.</p>
<p>Pretending like anthropogenic climate change isn't real, while covid is (correctly) an excuse to control us, is simply ludicrous. The only reason anthropogenic climate change is widely discussed nowadays is because the science is impossible to ignore. Just as the lack of science behind this covid madness will be plainly obvious in a couple years. Remember, believing in anthropogenic climate change used to be a conspiracy theory not too many decades ago - and guess what, the conspiracy theorists were correct.</p>
<p>As someone who is finishing my master thesis in the filed of Climate Change Adaptations, I am used to dealing with people who don't understand how Earth's natural processes are extremely fragile. Ecosystem equilibrium is vital for a stable planet, yet in terms of geologic time we have had the greatest impact on Earth in history, except for a few biotic crises (mass-extinction events). When we start tinkering with Earth (deforestation), we cause a rapid unbalance of an entire ecosystem, which in turn affects the biosphere. For example: insects are going extinct a rapid rate, and that has en enormous impact on ecosystems and the biosphere. Remember, even the smallest creatures are vital in order to preserve natural food webs/chains. Life on Earth is truly interconnected, and it is (or should be) plainly obvious that we as humans are disrupting Earth's balance.</p>
<p>Here are some of many examples:</p>
<p><strong>-Anthropogenic albedo shifts</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Overfishing</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Toxic waste in rivers → Ocean</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Infrastructure disrupting fragile ecosystems</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Methane from cows</strong></p>
<p><strong>-Oil spills</strong></p>
<p>-<strong>Human caused wildfires</strong></p>
<p>Do you still believe humans don't have an impact on Earth's climate?</p>
<p>During my years studying, I have been lucky to gain personal access to many climate stations in the state of California, containing a rich array of data from several decades, including soil moisture, fog data, humidity, short/long incoming solar radiation, short/long outgoing solar radiation, precipitation, heat and wind. The data I have had access to isn't something you simply find on the internet. Yet, what I see from the data is very clear. There are patterns you recognize.</p>
<p>I have done marine conservation work, witnessing first hand the effects of plastic pollution on marine life. I have done research in Coastal California on decreasing fog levels. I have done research in the Sonoran Desert on the effects of human development on odonate (indicator species) communities. I am also anti-big government, anti-corporation and anti covid-hysteria.</p>
<p>Anyway, sorry for my rant - and my apologies if I came across as aggressive. I simply cannot sit back when confronted with untruths.</p>
<p>Even if you for whatever reason don't believe me, well at least we both oppose the New Normal.</p>
<p><strong>"You shall not pollute the land in which you live, for blood pollutes the land, and no atonement can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the blood of the one who shed it. You shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell, for I the Lord dwell in the midst of the people of Israel.”</strong></p>
<p>Have a nice day!</p>

        <p>Did you notice that you confused anthropogenic climate change and environmental pollution?</p>
<p>If you want to discuss environmental pollution then do so on a thread dedicated to that. Overfishing, toxic waste water, ecosystem-damaging infrastructure, oil spills, radioactive waste, plastics, etc ARE NOT examples of anthropogenic climate change. </p>
<p>My post and all the links attached are related to GHG emissions: CO2, CH4, etc. For someone who lives in Norway, I am surprised that you wouldn't have noticed that the fjords and glaciers are still intact, despite decades of wrong predictions about their imminent destruction.</p>
<p>There's no SettledScience^(TM) on anthropogenic climate change because every single prediction since the 1930s has failed. The fact that the same people behind C19 are behind climate change should worry you. What do you think of this science: <a href="https://cei.org/blog/wrong-again-50-years-of-failed-eco-pocalyptic-predictions/">https://cei.org/blog/wrong-again-50-years-of-failed-eco-pocalyptic-predictions/</a> ?</p>
<p>Yes, we are both anti-NN. How is Norway faring?</p>

        <p>&rt;Did you notice that you confused anthropogenic climate change and environmental pollution?</p>
<p>No, I did not confuse the two. The examples I listed are factors that affect Earth's climate. Earth's ecosystems largely regulate the climate. When we massively disrupt ecosystems, we impact the climate as well.</p>
<p>And no, Norway's glaciers are melting at a rapid rate.</p>
<p>Oh, yes the Competitive Enterprise Institute at it again. Previously funded by Exxon Mobile. I haven't seen articles by the CEI calling for Big Oil to be held accountable for their crimes against humanity. I wonder why? It's like trusting the Pfizer funded CDC on vaccine safety. </p>
<p>So far Norway isn't facing any vaccine mandates or lockdowns, but that is mainly because people here are very compliant and trust the government without really questioning anything. I bet +90% of the adult population will soon be vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Mate, I absolutely agree that CEI et al are funded by Big Oil, but that doesn't negate the fact that they are exposing all the previous predictions that had a 100% failure rate. They are simply looking at previous data and showing how bad it was. They are NOT making new predictions. Don't confuse that with the FDA and C19 vaxxes.</p>
<p>When microplastics, radioactive waste and oil spills start changing the climate by altering the ecosystem, fax me.</p>
<p>Do you have data for Norwegian glaciers?</p>
<p>Yeah, Nordic countries are very compliant. At least there are no vaxxports.</p>
