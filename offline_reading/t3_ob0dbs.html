    <strong>Your Employer Is Paid By Government To Hire Vaccinated Employees</strong>
    <p><p>I have mentioned how Edna's Food Market is the 'tip of the spear' when it comes to getting Canadians to comply to covid19 measures such as the Mask, and did MORE than government ever could in doing so.</p>
<p>This is because Edna figures that 'private property law' grants her medical authority over your body and access to your medical information, as a condition for you to access food, medicine and other essential services.</p>
<p>And she DOES gain that authority every time a customer responds, argues, debates or tries to educate Edna, or complies with her demands. (Agreement through compliance)</p>
<p>Edna implemented a unenforceable sign "No Mask, no food" on her store window long before any government or health officer mandates existed (April 2020) and she will continue to do so long after mandates are lifted (July 1 2020). </p>
<p>Edna did more to promote covid19 fear, and did more to trample on the rights of perfectly healthy Citizens of Canada than government ever did, and ever COULD.</p>
<p>Now Edna has a new tool to 'encourage' you to comply, if you want a job after July 1 restrictions are lifted, and as the economy allegedly 'opens' but under a New World Normal of Masks and 'not-mandatory' Vaccinations.</p>
<p><em>Under the Healthy Hire Manitoba Program, local employers can apply for up to $50,000 in provincial support </em><strong><em>to help cover the wages of new employees who can attest they have been vaccinated or will be vaccinated.</em></strong><em> (up to $5,000 per employee)</em></p>
<p>$5000 / 3 months pay = $1666.66 / 160 (FT) = $10.416 per hour, about minimum wage.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/index.html?item=51489&amp;posted=2021-06-24&amp;fbclid=IwAR2Z1GqkVWJ3raoPy85XEB9VajAaL4hQe4I6AkjqBX0OddLBpNcqi2I8bZo">MANITOBA, CANADA LAUNCHES NEW $30 MILLION HEALTHY HIRE MANITOBA PROGRAM</a></p>
<p>Edna can basically 'hire back' employees at minimum wage who will work for almost free for her to up to 3 months pay per employee (10 employees).
Good deal for Edna huh?
All Edna has to do is hire employees who are vaccinated.</p>
<p>Do you want to see these government programs (which YOU are paying for) to help businesses and employers further trample on your human rights, freedoms and dignity?</p>
<p>This isn't a joke. Wake up.</p></p>

        <p>This is why the iT's a pRiVaTe CoMpAnY argument is so idiotic. They're intertwined with the government to further this dystopian brave new normal and prolong it as much as possible. It's really not too dissimilar from 1930s Germany.</p>

        <p>Indeed. This is how Hitler rose to power. He had co-operation with the business community to be the agents of change, the eyes of the State and also denied that group access to food, medicine and essential services.</p>

        <p>The $$$ is the only reason they are doing this.  Not to be altruistic.</p>
<p>I doubt they will pay over minimum wage, even though they are getting a subsidy from the government.  Then bitch about people not wanting to work for them or turnover being too high.</p>

        <p>Yes, they never say "People don't want to work because I don't pay enough" or "People don't want to work because I force a Mask on their face and Vaccinations".. nope. it's"People wont work because they're paid to stay home".</p>
<p>Even before covid19, I overheard a contractor/construction company 2 guys at Tim Horton's talking about how they can't keep people they hire and it was under "They just don't want to work", or "I don't know what to do, these guys won't show up for work", and even said "I pay them on Mondays, or they won't show up"..</p>
<p>I was self-employed, but always looking for other options for the 'off season' so I asked "how much do you guys pay?" and it was like "$13 an hour".... well. there's the problem.</p>

        <p>I knew they’d make it mandatory to have vaccine before working, eventually they will do it for apartments. So ultimately you are forced into it. Like ol’ Biden says, “wear a mask until you get vaccinated.” It’s not “wear a mask and vaccinate if you think it’s right, it’s mask up until you eventually get the vaccine.”</p>

        <p>Yes, completely possible for this to happen, that vaccination proof will be pre-requisite to even rent, and that will also be very problematic.</p>
<p>As usual though, this will occur more in Cult of the Mask and Vax majority areas, and perhaps not in more conservative areas who respect people's rights and privacy. So many of us will be having to make major life changes.</p>

        <p>These are the types of programs that those collecting CRB but having the benefit cut back in the next few weeks that the government was talking about.</p>
<p>Instead of giving it to them, they will give it to their employer, to get the employer lure back workers (legit), hire them and pay them when they might not be able to yet (legit) but only to vaccinated (BS).</p>

        <p>Same story with Costco in the US. They required masks almost 2-3 months before the mandates even started and now they're lifting mandate officially "only for vaccinated people". Not that anyone actually follows the rules anyway. I know I don't wear a mask out in public anymore.</p>
