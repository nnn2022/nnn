    <strong>Is There Any Hope Left? - Vaccine Passport, Lockdowns, New World Order</strong>
    <p><p>I'm really struggling with this sense of helplessness.  I cannot believe that people are so obedient and do not question the science that is there.  </p>
<p>But even with the science, people are still onboard with these vaccine passports/certificates/"freedom passes" (or whatever the govt wants to package them as).  </p>
<p>They've censored us so we cannot protest and now they're talking about making a refusal to get a vaccine punishable by barring you from things like supermarkets, losing your job, or even incarceration.  </p>
<p>Honestly I'd rather just off myself than live in a world like this...is there any way to fight this?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah and I don't think that's going to happen.  I've never been an antivaxxer but I don't get how people are just adamant about forcing a "vaccine" that has not even been fully approved.  </p>

        <p>unfortunately that is the only way, this can not move forward without the public pushing it forward in mass numbers. Some areas a large amount people no longer going with it and others are living nightmares right now. It's a really uncertain situation but I have a feeling another Summer is down the drain before it even began.</p>

        <p>&rt;is there any way to fight this?</p>
<p>Yes, it starts with you.</p>
<p>Make a blog, start a protest, make a YouTube/Bitchute/Rumble/Lbry/Odysee video, make flyers. Let folks know you do not agree with what is going on. You will find out very quickly you are not alone.</p>
<p>&rt;Honestly I'd rather just off myself than live in a world like this</p>
<p>Do not, I repeat, do not give these fuckers that are orchestrating this nonsense the privilege or satisfaction of seeing your obituary or you becoming a hash tag on Twitter or Gab; that's what they want. It means they won, and are laughing at you at your expense.</p>
<p>By you living, you're showing these fuckers they're going to have to try a lot harder if they want your life. In other words, make these assholes earn it. I will be honest with you, it will get worse before it gets better. However, the mere fact that you recognize that something is wrong is a first step, and now it is a matter of fighting back.</p>
<p>Remember that guy George Washington and those pesky colonists from the 13 colonies? Him and the 13 colonies lost practically almost every battle against the British, but you know what? Him and his army kept fighting, and never gave up even in the darkest of times; they were infected with a peculiar virus called liberty and freedom. </p>
<p>Remember, you do not have fight these goons head on, just follow the example of Washington, destroy their will to fight and you will win, and to me that is how you need to fight.</p>

        <p><strong>Don't fall for the propoganda</strong></p>
<p><strong>The government hasn't mandated vaccine passports because they can't.</strong> That would be against ADA Law and the 14th Amendment, which is why only private businesses (where you need a membership) can implement these policies.</p>
<p>The EEOC has declared Covid-19 a "direct threat" so employers could test for infection, but lack of immunity is not a direct threat and thus is covered under ADA Law. You would need to be given "equal access" or "reasonable accommodations" for a "public establishment". <em>The Vaccine Passport Rollout has enacted ADA Law and it applies to all public businesses with public access like the mall, or walmart, or a grocery store.</em></p>
<p>If we continue down this trail of following <em>for-profit</em> MSM propoganda then it will be established that the vaccine has enabled herd immunity, in which case it will be brought up that vaccine passports should be implemented. Stop being a labrat or enjoy the complete evaporation of liberties.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> it's a clinical trial, so obviously long term effects are unknown. The industry's vaccine being pushed (Pfizer) is one of, if not the most,  criminal habitual offender in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Be on the ready if any public business tries to ask about vaccinations</strong></p>
<p>https://www.ada.gov/criminaljustice/cj_complaint.html</p>
<p>The definiton of "disabled" is even more vague than you may imagine. </p>
<p>https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/notice-concerning-americans-disabilities-act-ada-amendments-act-2008</p>
<p>&rt;The Act retains the ADA's basic definition of "disability" as an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities</p>
<p>For DCVPs <em>(Digital Certificate Vaccine Passports):</em></p>
<p><em>(imo)</em> Therefore, if you are NOT able to access an establishment due to a vaccine passport, then you are "DISabled" from free access and equal opportunity, which is illegal. Same as if an establishment had stairs leading to the only entrance without wheelchair accessibility.</p>
<p>14th Amendment, Section 1 (cutout):</p>
<p>&rt;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws</p>
<p><strong>You can say this is false, but medical establishments have been discussing this for months:</strong></p>

        <p>Trust me there are plenty of people that feel the same way. To be blunt, I don’t think we’re ever going back to the life we had pre-covid. The fear mongering is too strong and most people have been believing that our gov’t is actually looking for our own interest and it’s hard to convince them otherwise. At this point what ever they say goes. Whether you or anyone else want to believe it or not it’s inevitable that this one world government happens, it’s a matter of when. And this whole covid situation is just a taste of what’s to come.</p>

        <p>Always remember that what you see online does not accurately reflect the real world.  Bots and bad actors (or straight up keyboard warriors) account for a lot of the discussion online, it's a psychological tactic to make you feel like you are in the minority, and therefore more likely to give in. </p>
<p>Talk as much as you can about it with people around you in the real world, you will see a different picture.  Most reasonable folks have some suspicion about what's going on, or at least will be willing to hear your concerns (provided they are logical and backed by good evidence).  You'd be surprised at how easy it is to spark the small stroke of doubt in someone's mind that slowly grows into them realizing the truth.  </p>
<p>The best thing you can do to combat the hopelessness is arm yourself with GOOD information and statistics, and have constructive, genuine conversations about it with people in real life.</p>

        <p>Given how far the US usually is behind both Europe and Canada on, for lack of a better term, technological changes, we could be looking at years before it's available here. </p>
<p>I use the chip and pin cards as an example, they were released in the UK in 2003 and weren't common in the US until 2014/2015ish if memory serves. However, I don't necessarily think it will take 10 years to roll it out worldwide, either. It's going to be combined with ID2020, and just taking a glance at their website will pretty much tell you what BG and the gang are up to there.</p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>
<p>edit: by "not common", I mean we only just received the chip readers for them at a McDonald's I worked in. We weren't in the major city but not rural either, a typical average small city. And we had just setup a way to even process chip payments.</p>

        <p>Wow I had no clue that chip cards were common back then in Europe. Why do you think it too the United States so long to adopt the superior tech?</p>

        <p>To be honest, I'm not sure. But it definitely might be something worth looking into.</p>
<p>Yeah, when I was in Norway they had just started the rollout of chip cards in my hometown USA. But I myself had never used a chip card, and was intrigued when someone I was with used one. 😅 They said it had been around for like 10 years maybe? My memory is fuzzy but this was around 2015.</p>
<p>It's really bizarre, considering the heights of technogical advances in America, that there are random things where we're the last 🤷‍♀️</p>

        <p>Some countries are complying like complete sheeple see China, South Korea, Hong Kong etc. No one questions the narrative </p>
<p>Here in the U.K. vaccine centres seem empty we are having more protests against the vaccine passports. </p>
<p>Mathematically if 30 percent of people are against them isn’t that theoretically enough to kill swathes of entire small businesses or am I missing something?</p>

        <p>They want you to be <strong>demoralized</strong> and feel as if you're powerless. You'll find regular people are a lot more reasonable. The lens in which you interact with the internet is all controlled by a bunch of psychopaths but this can only bleed so much into real life. Governments aren't reflective of what their constituents actually want, they pay a bunch of bureaucrats to look at Twitter everyday and then believe that this is what people want only to be routinely shocked at just how wrong they are.</p>
<p>Don't let them win before the fight has even begun. Look at how people are protesting around the world. Sometimes I'll read the default subs and the comment sections will be pretty red pilled on these issues. People are waking up, they're aware of the absolute clown show going on.  Don't off yourself, better to die fighting this tyranny.</p>
