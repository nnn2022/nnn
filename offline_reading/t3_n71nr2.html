    <strong>The Petty Fiefdoms of the Internet</strong>
    <p><p>A meta piece I wrote this morning. </p>
<p>“Be cool or be cast out” – Rush, ‘Subdivisons’</p>
<p>Welp. Cracked.com quietly did away with its comment section recently, an act that seems to have gone uncommented on. Largely because the people most affected no longer have a place to comment. I almost don’t blame Cracked for this one. The users were often funnier and more informative than the articles themselves were. Not to mention full of editors, fact checkers, and people that just generally reminded the Cracked writers that they were yet again rehashing the same listicle for the Nth time.</p>
<p>But still. It sucks. Not just Cracked (ha!), but also the fact that the Internet has gotten a tiny bit smaller and more homogenized. Which is now a daily occurrence. Some twenty years ago, long before this trend began in earnest, I coined the phrase “The petty fiefdoms of the Internet”, and it’s now more true than ever.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that I am abrasive and obnoxious. As Wired once pointed out, I’ve been banned from just about every website of note at least once. Often multiple times. But if you can’t say “fuck”, you can’t say “fuck the government”, as Lenny Bruce famously pointed out once. He didn’t say “fuck this heroin”, sadly. You also can’t say “Fuck this website and their shitty practices”. Or, “That is fucking unequivocally wrong, and here’s why.” There’s a lot of fucking things you can’t fucking say. Fuck.</p>
<p>Of course, we’ve been finessed into a corner, here. Often, the very people who tend to say this sort of thing are also ardent supporters of free enterprise. Now any complaints in this department are met with “Private business, they can do what they want.” Unless you’re a baker or are opposed to people wearing masks in your establishment, I suppose.</p>
<p>But corporations are de facto extensions of the government. They are licensed and sanctioned explicitly, while receiving liability protection and special tax laws. That’s…not free enterprise. Corporations are of course not people and shouldn’t be treated as such. Some libertarian thinkers correctly pointed this out over two hundred years ago. But they’re pretty much cancelled today anyway. So it’s unsurprising that governments and corporations espouse the same positions. It’s certainly a very profitable arrangement for CEOs and stockholders. For the rest of us, not so much.</p>
