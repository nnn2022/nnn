    <strong>As someone who has experienced real illness for over 2 years it boggles my mind to see how much hysteria there is over a flu virus</strong>
    <p><p>We're now living under martial law and people are freaking out over a flu virus, which for most people means they get a sore throat and the sniffles for a few days. I'm not saying that nobody gets extremely sick and dies from covid, just that the response is disproportional when you look at the numbers with a median fatality age of 75, near the average life expectancy.</p>
<p>For those who get cold symptoms for a few days and then wear a "I survived covid shirt", let me share with you an actual catastrophic disease I got from a pharma injection. All I got was a single hydrocortisone injection for a minor skin allergy 2 years ago, turns out I have an extremely rare hypersensitivity to that drug, possibly one in a million.</p>
<p>What happened next? Total chaos in every cell of my body. The injection caused an extreme form of Cushing Syndrome, which basically means an excess of the stress hormone cortisol and it's destructive to almost every cell in the body. Non-stop adrenaline, pacing, difficulty breathing, muscle weakness, pressure in chest and feeling like I was going to have a heart attack. The worst side effect was that my bones literally started breaking down. The doctors thought I was crazy until a DEXA scan of my spine found nearly 20% loss of bone mass in 10 months, and then reluctantly admitted that in rare cases it can cause Cushing Syndrome. The bones in my face are literally a bit smaller now, and I could feel my teeth shifting position.</p>
<p>It's now been over 2 years and the side effects get a bit weaker each month, much weaker now than the first few months but I still feel effects and don't know how long it will last. It's possible that my bones can grow back after I make it to the other side. Perhaps this will lessen your fear of a flu virus.</p></p>

        <p>The hysteria is manufactured. There is certainly a reason for all this.</p>
<p>Boggles my mind how they have suppressed the evidence on Ivermectin and the importance of Vitamin D. </p>
<p>The silence after Dr. Pierre Kory's testimony is very telling.</p>

<p>They say this every time there's a story of someone being injured from pharmaceutical medication.  There are millions of these stories.</p>
<p>I hope you are well and can recover.  These people are criminals to humanity.</p>

        <p>Many years back I had a fever and a cough so bad that I couldnt breathe and ran out of breath. I would start coughing and then start gasping for air, while trying not to cough, then continue coughing. All with muscleaches, nausea, the whole 9. Guess what. That was normal. Nobody felt sorry for me and shut down their lives for almost a year. Nobody wore a mask everywhere to protect themselves. Sickness happens. Part of life. Get over it and move on, world. Please.</p>

        <p>I had the flu a couple times in my life.
I could hardly move for weeks, I couldnâ€™t eat.
Just about everything hurt, I fell asleep crying thinking I would die in my sleep.
At those moments is when I understood how the flu kills people...and covid is the flu.</p>

        <p>I think people in general have forgotten that the human condition is fraught with fragility and disease.  I too have suffered a one in x side effect from a routine procedure that nearly took my life.  Maybe we have a little more perspective that life is tenuous and itâ€™s worth living while the goingâ€™s good and not hiding in fear.</p>

        <p>Yes, we do. But thay doesn't mean we do all of this in response. CDC estimates that only 6% of deaths are directly from covid, with the rest having an average of 2.9 Co morbidities. Deaths are counted as anything within 28 days of a positive test. So it is a real disease but it's no excuse for all this destruction.</p>
