    <strong>"Covid isn't real"</strong>
    <p><p>I thought we were for the most part past this misconception but I've been seeing it more lately, especially since lab leak theory has been finally acknowledged as the most likely source of covid and came to the realization that it's a far better way to discredit valid skepticism than the vaccine magnet type stuff.</p>
<p>I understand that for some saying stuff like this is similar to saying the pandemic is a hoax etc. or in other words an overreaction and sometimes is just shorthand for rejecting all of the bullshit.  The fact that per the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm#understanding-the-numbers">CDC's guidance for tracking covid deaths</a> and the supposed disappearance of the flu altogether might lead people to believe people towards this conclusion however it would require a conspiracy that not only involves all of the politicians directing it, it requires the entirety of the scientific and medial community to also be in on it and lying about it the existence of something for which there is an abundance of evidence to support.</p>
<p>Saying "covid isn't real" is akin to saying the moon landing never happened since you weren't on the trip there yourself and by doing this, you are providing cover to the people who are responsible for the real coverup and deception such as Fauci who has blame in all of this via the gain of function research and everyone else involved who knew the truth and pushed the zoonosis theory anyways.</p>
<p>Covid is real and is a threat to the vulnerable demographic that it primarily targets such as elderly and the obese and denying this discredits all of the legitimate skepticism that we discuss here.</p>
<p>I encourage anyone to try to change my mind about though because I realize that not all of this is a disingenuous attempt to discredit valid skepticism.  Reply to this thread with your evidence and we can talk it out.</p></p>

        <p>I firmly believe that they rebranded all flu cases as "Covid", making it appear far more infectious than it actually is. On the subject of whether it being real or not I tend to lean more towards it being real, with the reaction to it being overblown and used as a tool by corrupt politicians, scientists and media hacks to gain power and money.</p>

        <p>Why do you tend to lean that way, and not toward there's not actually a virus? Is it because people are more accepting of the position you take?</p>
<p>I'm not trying to be snarky at all. I just know that I used to sort of go along and say "Oh, yeah, of course I think there IS a virus!" That way, I could sidestep the more intense criticism. Then i got annoyed with myself, because what I ACTUALLY REALLY think is that there's no virus. I can't tell you why they are going strong now with the narrative of a Wuhan leak. It seems strangely sudden don't you think? And perhaps that narrative serves a political purpose. Who knows. I do realize that no one in this subreddit knows, at this moment, despite how rabid they might get about my point of view, lol.</p>

        <p>So they rebranded all flu cases as "Covid", on a GLOBAL scale. Like, each and every affected country around the world did this.</p>
<p>So that's hundreds of governments, thousands if not tens of thousands international variants of the CDC, hundreds of thousands if not millions of hospitals and care centers. With literally hundreds of millions of people working there in all types of jobs, ranging from caregivers, nurses, to doctors, professors, lab-assistants, chemists, biologists, lab-technicians, you name it.</p>
<p>And somehow all these people, on a GLOBAL scale once again mind you, are down with secretly converting all the regular flu-cases to COVID cases to make it seem worse than it is. And somehow they also managed to do this outside of the regular flu-seasons.</p>
<p>And out of those hundreds of millions of people, no doctor or other type of medical personnel, most of whom all took the hippocratic oath mind you, might have decided to be a whistleblower and leak some documents or so that outline the nefarious purposes of whichever global shadow government is somehow able to control ALL the nations of the earth simultaneously.</p>
<p>Which begs the question, if a shadow organisation is already powerful enough to control pretty much all the nations around the globe to keep this a secret and to artificially inflate numbers for their nefarious purposes, if they're THAT good...then would they even need this pandemic to begin with?</p>
<p>I mean, they can obviously control hundreds of millions of people already. All global governments are in their pockets. All global science institutions.  So what exactly is the play here?</p>

        <p>Dude...that's mostly in America my man. Not every country on the planet is a shithole where people can be fired at will, and have barely any social safety nets for when they do get fired.</p>
<p>You sound so convinced but once again; you people need to step out of your U.S. minded patterns and put your global thinking caps on.</p>
<p>Geopolitics isn't all about the USA. And many, many countries around the world don't deal with the same issues that the U.S. does.</p>
<p>Also, on a GLOBAL scale, do you really believe that out of HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of people who work in healthcare, that not a single one of HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of people would be selfless enough to risk their jobs, hell - even their lives, for this type of information to come out? Shit, many whistleblowers risked it all for far less interesting information than this would be.</p>
<p>Like, aside from the fact that y'all never seem to think past your own borders, it also seems like you guys have no concept of the enormity of those types of numbers. The scale of shit happening on a global level.</p>
<p>It'd be hard enough to keep this shit a secret in a single hospital with a mere few thousands of employees.</p>
<p>Let alone in EVERY hospital, in EVERY research center, in EVERY labratory, in any government controlled CDC-equivalent for EVERY nation around the globe, etcetera, etcetera.</p>
<p>Like, really just think about it for a second. The sheer scale of it all.</p>
<p>Try to imagine why some random-ass Japanese virologist would stay quiet at the behest of what, some conglomeration of corporate shadow cabals who secretly control the world and want to turn everyone into a communist or whatever? Or why poor South African countries would give a flying fuck what some likely western or possibly chinese or russian powers would want them to say?</p>
<p>Why a western europe, where the international court of justice is seated for fuck's sake, would just go <em>"Yes, big corporate bigwig interests, fuck over our small economies most of which thrive on tourism and trade, please master may we have some more recessions?"</em></p>
<p>It makes no goddamn sense.</p>

        <p>Btw, plenty of them have spoken out about it. They literally had to create organizations like the World Doctors Alliance just to protect themselves. And that's only ONE of them that has sprouted up out of this. You think they don't exist because they are banned from your television.</p>

        <p>I don't mean some random ass people with some yee-yee ass claims. </p>
<p>I mean some actual, verifiable evidence. Anything as long as it really holds up to scrutiny. Peer reviewed research. Or unfalsifiable documentation (or well, that might be hard to produce - but at the very least documentation that seems real, holds up to scrutiny, and is tracable through reliable sources).</p>
<p>I find it far more likely that the same type of misinformation campaigns that have been used in previous years are being used currently for covid. Like any other politicized topic, it's extremely easy for foreign powers (or hell, even national powers) to create propaganda campaigns to distract the masses and to further polarize society in order to destabilize a country and keep control in the hands of the old elite, mostly the corporate bigwigs and wall street powers.</p>
<p>That's what you should be afraid of. That's the only real "conspiracy".</p>
<p>It is far more likely that COVID is 100% real and that there is no PLANETWIDE conspiracy, but that it's easy enough in the days of social media and 24 hour news cycles to spin information certain ways to get clicks and to get people to believe a certain narrative that plays into the hands of whomever owns the outlet you're getting your news from. Then there's thousands of misguided souls who perpetuate and continue to spread this misinformation that they themselves likely don't fully understand, until it's omnipresent in a diluted form that reaches droves of people.</p>
<p>That's how you're being played. </p>
<p>Once again; if there is an organizatoin that is powerful enough to control millions of hospitals worldwide, and hundreds of millions of employees, and all news-stations in all countries around the globe, then they are already running the planet and there is no need for al lthis pretense. If they are truly that powerful they could just take out an ad on all planetwide TV channels right now and just straight up announce that they are the new world order, they are our current rulers, and there's nothing we can do against it.</p>
<p>But that seems way too unlikely doesn't it? </p>
<p>It's far more likely that you're just being played because in this day and age it's extremely hard to find factual, verifiable information, and we as a species have an unfortunate tendency to fall victim to confirmation bias and dunning kruger. Couple that with social media's tendency to cater results and recommendations to our search-behavior and to the secret profiles they've built for us, and of course you're being flooded with information that fits your narrative.</p>
<p>That is the biggest issue (aside from climate change) currently plaguing the world. We're being made our own enemy in order to distract most of us from the fact that a handful of greedy old fucks are earning most of the world's money.</p>

        <p>Right. You want someone on the tell-a-vision to tell you lol</p>
<p>Dude your talking about there being "millions of hospitals" where do you pull this stat from? I think I know where you pulled it from as it stinks. The U.S. alone has less than 8,000.</p>

        <p>Yeah alright you got me there, I got a little bit too heated and pulled some larger than life numbers outta my ass to illustrate a point.</p>
<p>Nevertheless. I'd like to see you try to control the flow of information within a SINGLE hospital succesfully. Then extrapolate it to thousands. Then extrapolate it to tens of thousands in different countries with different cultures, different politics, different socio-economic norms, different priorities than the U.S. </p>
<p>And then realize it's not only hospitals but also GP's, care facilities, bio-chemical labs, research facilities, vaccine producers, you name it. There are so, so, so SO many governments, companies and people involved with this.</p>
<p>That's what I want you to do, instead of try to focus on these "GOTCHA" moments like that makes any of your other claims more realistic.</p>
<p>Just take a step back instead of handwaving my arguments away by trying to pick at minor flaws, and genuinely and rationally think, step by step in a logical fashion, of what this truly means and entails in terms of scale on a global stage. Just try to imagine it for a good few minutes.</p>

        <p>&rt; If you WANT to know WHY they do it. Klaus Schwab tells you. Zee Great Reset into the 4th Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Eh, we'll see about that. The WEF can talk all they want but it'll be damned hard to get the entire world to agree on it. </p>
<p>We do need to make some strides as a society. I'm not saying Schwab's way is the way to do it. But why not strive for the transition to a more Star Trek-esque planetary society?</p>
<p>No more hunger, no more war, no more poverty. No more money. Status is earned through the pursuit of your ambitions and by honing your craft, whatever it may be. Maybe we finally can turn humanity's pursuits towards the stars. Or at the very least start harnessing the technology to save our own planet, before we start thinking of colonizing the next one. But either way, a new purpose rather than just to 'consume' wouldn't be too bad. </p>
<p>Right now, you and me, we're just here to make other people rich. A very select few people. That's literally what our lives amount to. All with the dream that maybe, one day, we could be one of those people. But most of us won't ever be. And no, even if you're upper middle class right now, you're not one of the elite right now and you will never be. </p>
<p>Defending your corporate overlords will not do you any good. Don't let yourself be willingly exploited. You only get one life. It's time to start thinking about how to make that single chance on this globe better, not just for yourself but for everyone. </p>
<p>We don't do that by creating more meaningless office jobs, or by fighting to keep people working on coalmines while they ruin their lungs and their futures. </p>
<p>Our lives aren't getting any better just because we can afford a slightly bigger house, a fancier car, or that fancy gadget you wanted. I mean sure, a house is nice obviously, but there are millions, if not billions, of people around the globe who can't even afford to BUY a house and are stuck renting, or worse. All the while most of what we can think of is if it'd be economical to get a third car for the family - while the planet is dying, and kids in africa are still starving. Hell, kids in AMERICA are fucking starving. It's ridiculous and we need to move beyond this, at some point in time. </p>
<p>It doesn't have to happen all at once. But we do need to keep evolving and progressing, for the good of our species.</p>

        <p>Yeah but this ain't just America bud.</p>
<p>I feel like a lot of y'all have a real difficult time grasping the concept of something happening on a GLOBAL scale.</p>
<p>Take all geopolitics into consideration. There's countries who are political adversaries, or hell, even physically at war. Why wouldn't they use any of this information to disrupt the other country?</p>
<p>Once again; if ANY type of organisation has the power to control hundreds of MILLIONS of people on a GLOBAL scale (including countries who are literally at war), then they are already more powerful than you can ever imagine - and they wouldn't need some sort of global ruse to consolidate an extremely minor amount of power.</p>
<p>Because now that the vaccines are rolling in, things are returning back to normal. So what did they gain? Those who supposedly controlled these hundreds of millions of people via student debt or whatever (I also love how you think that every nation on earth has the same astronomical levels of student debt as the U.S. by the way).</p>
<p>What did they buy? A year of financial instability? A slight economic depression - which, when people can finally start spending again between now and a few months, when everything is 100% opened again and things are back to normal, will surely recover?</p>
<p>There is no endgame for this that REALISTICALLY outlines a clear goal or profit that has been achieved by that secret shadow government or whatever. IF this was a global ruse, a global conspiracy, it was extremely useless, as within now and a year from now (assuming there won't be any weird mutations) things will be back to normal again.</p>
<p>Also, you say "Technocratic dictatorship", but I'm not sure you know what those words mean. A technocracy is one where ELECTED officials are selected for their expertise in a certain field. One could do this in multiple ways that still maintain our regular democratic values.</p>
<p>If it were to be a DICTATORSHIP, then it could not be a technocracy, as it would be extremely unlikely that whomever ends up being a dictator also just so happens to be the very best person for the job. As there is no human who is a master of all trades, it is impossible for a single person to execute all functions or all positions required by a technocracy, whereas a dictatorship is literally the consolidation of power into a single person.</p>
<p>I guess technically you could have a dictator who would select a cabinet of people who are literally all the best people for their respective jobs. That might qualify as a technocratic dictatorship. But in that case, if you literally have the best of the best in each spot where you would want them...then would that truly be so bad?</p>
<p>Anyway, it sounds like you're just slinging around terminology that you think sounds cool because you want to convince yourself that you understand the way the world works, but you don't. And hey, that's okay. Everything is far too complex for one single human to be able to understand everything. But at least be open to learning more, rather than hold on to your conspiracies and false narratives.</p>

        <p>Alright, a global society. Well.</p>
<p>If we look at societies as defined by the Kardashev scale, moving to a type I civilization would require global cooperation.</p>
<p>We would want to move towards a future where we have an abudance of energy, and can manipulate this energy in order to make life easier for everyone.</p>
<p>If we move on to a global civilization, current issues like borders, trade embargos, tariffs, and even wars could be scrapped. This means unlimited trade for any 'nation' on earth. Each company, or each person could technically earn as much profit as possible. Production would be possible anywhere, as we would no longer be limited to produce items in a location where wages are cheapest, for instance. That means we wouldn't have to rely on China or India to make specific products, but those could be made in the U.S. or Europe or anywhere else on the planet where people need jobs, or where specific people have specific skills that are needed.  That means the economy would be skill driven rather than cost-driven, as cost is no longer an issue. This means that it'll be far easier for anyone to get the job they actually want, for a reasonable wage.</p>
<p>Once we've mastered Fusion, or the creation of energy through antimatter/matter reactions, or any other type of massive energy production, we'll no longer have to rely on international trade agreements such as with the arabs for oil, or with the russians for gas. Energy production is viable anywhere on the planet and as such the cost of energy will lower drastically. Aside from lower gas prices or lower electricity costs, this means we can produce energy so cheaply that we can apply it to solve all sorts of problems.</p>
<p>With a unified global planetary society, it'd be peanuts to stop climate change (which should already be halted once we've transferred to these new means of creating energy). It should also be relatively easy to even help restore the climate.</p>
<p>We could also start thinking about new technological breakthroughs. Obviously hunger would be eradicated as all resources are abundant and can easily be shared around the planet. How about slowing or stopping aging? How about curing diseases like cancer? And last but not least, we could start exploring space - like, REALLY start exploring space. Imagine all of humanity, each and every country, working TOGETHER to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>Without wars, without political rivalries, we could be like gods.</p>
<p>I don't know if you've ever watched Star Trek: The Next Generation, but imagine a society like that. A few hundred years from now. No more money, extremely advanced technology, and everyone is free to pursue any goal they want. Status and respect isn't gained by measuring your bank account, but by measuring the strength of your character and your achievements in life, your contributions to society, who you truly are.</p>
<p>I mean, obviously we won't be meeting any aliens with weird shit on their foreheads. That's bullshit. But the idea behind a post-scarcity society is what should be our ultimate goal. Humanity united, no matter our race or creed. Standing together as one species, rather than being divided and subject to this endless infighting at the behest of the few in power.</p>
<p>We'll no longer have to bow and cowtow to those who happen to have had the luck in life to own more resources or own more land. We could pick and choose who to respect, and they would hold no more power over us than we would over them. We could pursue noble goals and noble causes.</p>
<p>We could be what we were always meant to be.</p>
<p>But people are too worried about 'muh profit', 'muh borders' and 'muh racial purity' to let any of that matter, and the old guard, those few obscenely rich old racist fucks, are playing you like a fiddle, using you as a lapdog defending their right to control us all, making you believe it's for your own good and for the best of humanity to keep living in this cesspool of mediocrity. Because they know that when humanity is truly united, there will be no place for them at the top. And that scares the ever living shit out of them.</p>
<p>And so people are distracted with conspiracies, inundated with conservative propaganda, so all these average joes keep fighting to "keep things the way they are" and to oppose any and all change. Just so these old farts can sit our their joyride in unimaginable luxury, while we do the work to enrich them.</p>
<p>We aren't supposed to be these wage-slaves. There's so much more to life and the universe, and to what we could be achieving. We just have to be forward-thinking and make the goddamn change.</p>

        <p>Thank you. I appreciate that.</p>
<p>I am willing to entertain notions that there are national conspiracies, hell, even international conspiracies. Of course that is technically possible.</p>
<p>But for something like this, on a global scale? To have the entire world agree on something is quite the unique feat. It's either this or aliens that could get us all looking in the same direction, anything else usually just ends up with nations divided and sometimes even at war.</p>
<p>Now we're at a point where all independent nations, despite the geopolitical situations, have (eventually) all in one way or another accepted the fact that the global pandemic is real, and have to differing levels of success taken measures against it, including a global vaccination effort. </p>
<p>To orchestrate something like that would just be insane. Do we truly believe there is a power out there that controls the US, Russia, China and the EU, all at the same time?</p>
<p>It's ridiculous. If that power exists they would be literally ruling the world already. There'd be no need for pretense, we'd be living under an open planetary dictatorship.</p>

        <p>Keep fighting this uphill battle, we'll be right here by your side.</p>
<p>This place has scared me more than anything has in a while, and I have spent a lot of time reading discourse in QAnon and white-supremacy communities over the years. I think it's because I have very close friends and family members who share the sentiments found in this sub, loving and kind people, who have recently started flirting with Jewish conspiracies, secret "socialist agendas" and even some transphobia (which is <em>very</em> uncharacteristic of them). I'm not vaccinated yet, and I'm not looking forward to that confrontation; I'm worried that they will be afraid to even come near me in fear of "contamination".</p>
<p>In conversations we mostly avoid these subjects now, but it's impossible to completely avoid it. I'm desperately working to understand how people reach this point, and how to give them the tools to climb up again. We managed to identify the main source of friction a while back, and I believe it was a good hint at what goes on under the surface:</p>
<p>They felt that the problem I had was that <em>I read too much and reach conclusions based on that</em>, opening myself up for brainwashing. The world is completely overrun with misinformation and lies, so you cannot determine what is true based on research alone. They encouraged me to <em>first find the truth that felt right to me, then search for facts and information to reinforce that truth.</em> And if I'm being honest, they're much better off mentally because of that. It sounds nice.</p>

        <p>The way I see it, it's ignorance by people in not knowing how to properly research. Mix this in with scale being a thing that is generally hard to grasp. Perfect recipe for the ignorant to make up a Boogeyman rather than take the simplest answer.</p>

<p>This is a biggie, and goes for the majority of people I believe. It's surprisingly common for someone to hear "0.1% of the population" as nothing, while "4000 dead" as a lot in comparison. It helps to have experience with applied math to offset that inherent weakness, as you gain a more natural relationship with ratios.  </p>
<p>&rt;it's ignorance by people in not knowing how to properly research</p>
<p>If you check out the last bit of my reply (to the same comment you replied to), I'd like to add that there can also be a religious/spiritual aspect to it that is incompatible with the scientific method, a method dependent on a sort of internal "sense of truth", and I believe a different approach is needed for those that applies to. What do you think?</p>

        <p>Covid IS real. No one I’ve spoken with outside of straight up kooks thinks otherwise. However, the reality of Covid is the negligible mortality rate for healthy individuals typically under 40 years old.

        <p>The issue was never Covid being some incredibly deadly virus. The issue was how nobody had immunity, and how contagious it is to the point where it overwhelms health systems that aren't equipped for it. And a lot of health systems in the US were not equipped for it. I don't think anyone should be forced to take the vaccine but I'd urge anyone hesitating to just talk to a professional instead of seeking out random people's opinions on the internet.</p>

        <p>The issue was “never” how deadly it was? Go ahead and stroll through mainstream media circa March - December 2020 and your claim is quickly refuted as that is exactly what was proclaimed on a daily basis. And yes speak with your doctor if you are worried about covid by all means that’s exactly what everyone is preaching about the vaccines.</p>

        <p>Right and just to be clear my argument is people shouldn’t be forced to get vaccinated, because as I clarify that’s what is being debated in Congress.

        <p>Humanity has never done this with any other virus that has a comparable death rate.... so it's not that we think vulnerable people have little value, it's not that at all. No one forced flu vaccines in the name of protecting the immune compromised from the flu... </p>
<p>What deception is that? That you think for the first time in humanity, that everyone should get a forced vaccine, over a virus like the flu in severity. Did you know that people who are unhealthy or immune compromised <em>can</em> get really hurt from the flu too? Yet that vaccine isn't forced even though flu deaths <em>can</em> happen. Don't lie and say we don't care about people, I can't speak for everyone here, but there are caring people on here.</p>

        <p>1: Polio commonly caused permanent nerve damage and paralysis, even paralysis of the breathing muscles. That's almost as relevant as bringing up Ebola in this conversation.</p>
<p>2: Even all 4 of the polio vaccines aren't forced, the CDC just recommends that all children should get them. That virus is a lot more harmful than Covid so I understand why I received that vaccine as a child.</p>

        <p>So explain to me why that translates to vaccinating <em>everyone.</em></p>
<p>This is a new kind of vaccine but other generations of vaccines from just a couple years ago worked just fine. And those weren't forced on everyone for the flu. So why does a <em>new</em> vaccine warrant forced vaccinations? Just because it's a new kind? It's like you're implying that old vaccines couldn't be given to the masses, or that they didn't work. Even though every year millions upon millions got the flu shot every year.</p>

        <p>That's not what happened with the flu virus, because it mutates. That's why they're talking about a booster shot every 6 months for the covid vaccine.</p>

        <p>&rt;"Covid is just the flu" I don't remember the flu killing 1 in 10.</p>
<p>Covid doesnt kill 1 in 10.  The Infection Fatality Rate is 99.7%.</p>
<p>I was referring specifically to your 63yr old mother.  For her age, (health notwithstanding) she has about a 10% of requiring hospitalization if she got covid.  About "1 in 10".</p>
<p>Not death.</p>
<p>Her chance of dying would be around 2%.  But again, this is heavily dependent on health.</p>

        <p>First of all...  you have to stop comparing those who don't believe the  "the virus" is real as the same ones who think the earth is flat or that we've never been to the moon.</p>
<p>If you slow down and look at how it all evolved...  </p>
<p>The amount of fear that was spread from the beginning... they WERE saying it was from china before, that was the message.  LOOK OUT, BAT SOUP!!</p>
<p>People were dropping dead in the streets!!!  Remember???</p>
<p>And they were using PCR tests... a test that is complete bullshit to begin with.  EVERYONE suddenly fucking had "THE VIRUS".  </p>
<p>If you examine the timeline, its very evident to me... that the flu/common cold was simply renamed and the tests were adjusted to scare the shit out of everyone.</p>
<p>How many people did they kill with the fucking respirators???  Did we forget about that?</p>
<p>And...  maybe the most important part, they made ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine unavailable for treatment.  THIS allowed them to use the "vaccine" as an EUA!!!</p>
<p>Now that people are starting to wake up and see that this "virus" isn't even real, they start flooding the airwaves with the WUHAN theory?!!</p>
<p>If the media is reporting it, what makes you think its real?  LMAO</p>
<p>This only scares the shit out of MORE people...  "WOW, its from a lab??!  I BETTER get that fucking "vaccine"!!</p>
<p>Its just another way for people to NOT LOOK where they should be.  LOOK!  BATS IN A LAB!!  LOL</p>
<p>Just one more thing...  and think about this slowly.</p>
<p>HOW... did a fucking "virus", suddenly appear simultaneously in only those places and ONLY those places that HAD the PCR tests??  HUH?</p>
<p>Suddenly, all the countries that had PCR tests, ALL had fucking outbreaks?!  LMFAO.</p>

        <p>Agreed, I don’t know what to think but I know the Nocebo effect is real- if you pump enough fear into a population over a supposed virus, even if it isn’t real, that fear can make the body turn the common cold or flu into something much more deadly. The people I know who said they had Covid don’t actually know because they were never tested, suddenly anyone who has a cold/flu has Covid. And the tests are highly problematic to boot. </p>
<p>To me it kinda seems irrelevant whether it’s real or not, there’s always some kinda virus floating around the air- many I’m sure. The fear seems to be the real pandemic</p>

        <p>I’m not sure what I think, I’m wondering if the protein was the real engineered part, pairing nicely with the shot. Coronavirus was just the platform to deliver it. It seemed they were really focused on hitting the ACE2 receptor for all the parts of the body it can bind to.</p>

<p>Yes, these are very questionable but there are other explanations possible that do not require buy-in and complete coverup from the entirety of the scientific and medical community.</p>

        <p>It’s a weird dynamic. I work with an older gentleman who thinks the vaccine is a huge risk to his health, so he has refused to get it. </p>
<p>He was on multiple occasions gotten very nervous when coworkers report that they are getting tested for Covid due to possible exposure. He is really worried about the virus due to his health history. Yet the vaccine scares him more.</p>

        <p>Though I'm not from the covid is a hoax camp when the media started calling Trump rallies super spreader events but didn't apply the same to BLM rallies many people stopped taking it seriously.  Also as one poster recently said if the virus is this deadly where are all the biohazard bins to discard our used masks?  The Delta Variant is coming and still no biohazard bins.  There's no consistency.  It's either a serious plague or it's not.  Does the virus politely decide not to attack when you're eating a meal at a diner but suddenly becomes deadly when you're leaving the exit heading towards your car?  The whole thing is very philosophically inconsistent.</p>

        <p>I really don't want to get into the election but if Trump was slightly better at politics, he should have been able to crush Biden but instead he just rallied to the base which included trolling everyone else.  It was a great strategy to create passionate and loyal supporters and puff out his feathers but it was shitty electoral strategy.</p>
<p>But also, if the media would have given him a fair shake, that would have probably made the difference as well.  I'm pretty sure neither of us have any way of knowing either way objectively aside from what we've heard but the fact that he was calling the 2016 election rigged before the votes were counted and he won should make you question the same claim he made for 2020.</p>

<p>\&rt;Most of the studies are from locations with overall COVID-19 mortality rates that are higher than the global average. The inferred median infection fatality rate in locations with a COVID-19 mortality rate lower than the global average is low (0.09%). If one could sample equally from all locations globally, the median infection fatality rate might even be substantially lower than the 0.23% observed in my analysis.<br>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768536/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33768536/</a></p>
<p>\&rt; Conclusions: All systematic evaluations of seroprevalence data converge that SARS-CoV-2 infection is widely spread globally. Acknowledging residual uncertainties, the available evidence suggests average global IFR of \~0.15% and \~1.5-2.0 billion infections by February 2021 with substantial differences in IFR and in infection spread across continents, countries and locations.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32534626/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32534626/</a></p>
<p>\&rt;we estimated that for every reported confirmed case, there were 11·6 infections in the community.  </p>
<p>So what if it is real? When you corrupt data, the corruption overshadows everything.</p>

        <p>So, you mainly believe that "covid" is real because it would be too difficult to fake? Yet we can go through every aspect of this "pandemic" and find conflicts of interest, perverse incentives and coercion. Why is it so hard to believe that the drug companies corrupted the government for rent-seeking purposes? There were no flu cases last year and a "novel" disease with the exact same symptoms came into being. Doesn't that seem like a red flag?</p>
<p>Everybody knows that the PCR tests were fake, thanks to president Magafuli. Where's the real proof that "covid" exists?</p>

        <p>Symptoms, transmissibility and a number of other differences you can take a look at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm">on the CDC page</a>.</p>
<p>I understand your perspective though.  When we have been lied to so blatantly, it's hard to accept any supposed truths we cannot verify with our own eyes.  </p>
<p>I totally admit there is a remote chance you could be right too since the only compelling anecdotal evidence for me personally is my gf's uncle who was hospitalized and she was kind of helping take care of him after he got out for a bit and was attesting towards certain symptoms etc which support the diagnosis.</p>
<p>But we live in California and in the supposed ground zero for where it started in the US and that is pretty much it in terms of knowing anyone affected aside from another friend who's sister apparently was briefly hospitalized.  So I get it, it's hard to fathom all of what we are doing  with that type of anecdotal evidence but from what I've heard it's an issue that is focused among certain communities like the Latino population at least where I'm at which I admit not being fully plugged into atm.</p>

        <p>Has there been an increase in prescriptions for Midazolam among the affected communities? Are you prepared to trust the CDC when they are funded in large part by the very party currently making bank off "covid", the drug companies?</p>
<p>We can still be respectful of people who have died while disputing their actual cause of death if it seems false.</p>

        <p>I'm not convinced covid was a real threat to society. If the virus exists is of little importance. The real issue is the draconian governments across the world tightening there stranglehold on the population.</p>

        <p>I agree.  It was a threat to a certain small portion of society but does that mean everyone else has to put their lives on hold and suffer?  It's a complicated calculation that most people are incapable of discussing due to our inability to confront the morbid inevitability of our certain ends.</p>

<p>600k dead Americans sounds like a lot. But when the population is hundreds of millions it is a rather small portion.</p>

        <p>It's real. It was just last year's flu albeit a slightly more nasty version. That's all. Because where did the flu go then last year? Oh that's right, it disappeared because everyone was wearing masks. But the cooties were running rampant even though everyone was wearing masks. Or, and this is just my basic level understanding of how a respiratory virus spreads, masks don't do shit to stop a virus because it's smaller than what a worthless piece of cloth can stop and all of this was just the flu. Gee, I wonder which it could have been.</p>
<p>Now these bs 'variants' that the news keeps telling everyone to be scared of. Oh the double mutant version, the India version, the triple dog dare you ultra mutant version. <em>That's</em> all a down to.</p>

        <p>I thought that the virus has been sequenced and known variants discovered. Testing may not be accurate enough, and there were reports of Covid deaths that were actually due to other causes. But SARSCov2 was engineered and released, probably accidentally, by the Wuhan lab. You don’t weld apartments shut in China if it’s nothing.</p>

        <p>Let me preface by saying I'm not at all in the 'covid not real' camp but in terms of its potential threat or direct effect on my daily routine I'd say it might as well not exist. Like any other cold season since forever. You get it or you don't. You catch it whilst you're weak or impaired and you might die, same as ever.</p>
<p>The campaign you're describing is what we refer to as "controlled opposition". Convince the enemy you partly or mostly agree with them on the topic of the hour and then undermine their whole position by either saying or doing something so insane that you discredit them by association. Sort of like attacking a strawman but instead you make the opponent let you build the strawman inside their own yard and stand back quietly while all their <em>friends</em> burn it.</p>
<p>I have read over a discussion thread (outside reddit, not going to link it) where one of the posters was passionately convinced that not just covid but the entire field of virology was a hoax. I read the arguments with an open mind, I don't agree with the conclusion but it was actually kind of refreshing to see an alternate point of view. If you're curious ("wtf caused all those diseases then" etc) his main idea was that the tiny protein/rna packets that show up as viruses on electron scans are actually intercellular messaging systems gone haywire as a <strong>response</strong> to illness rather than the cause. He offered as the real cause a kind of generic hand wave towards 'toxins' and 'nutritional deficits'. </p>
<p>I'm not saying all that as some sort of apologism for our latest trolls just a reminder that there are valid reasons someone could have been honestly persuaded that viruses don't cause disease, and if they want to debate that in good faith, well they should probably pick a better battlefield for it lol.</p>
