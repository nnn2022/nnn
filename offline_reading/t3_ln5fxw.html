        <p>Bingo, payments today can essentially be divided in 4 categories, all with their own pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash: anonymous and hard to trace, but created by central banks and can easily be removed, hyperinflation would be the last tool to get rid of it if people are still using it after a ban.</li>
<li>Gold &amp; silver: great store of value, up 10 000% towards the USD in 100 years due to inflation and fractional reserve scams run by the banks with the sole purpose to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich elite. Unfortunately unusable as a medium of exchange as it cannot easily be divided into smaller units.</li>
<li>Bitcoin and other crypto's: open source, digital peer to peer payments without middlemen, has the same properties as gold and silver, can run decentralized apps, handle contracts and more beside being a currency. The elite can't control it, only thing they can do is attempting to manipulate the exchange rate to USD, which of course will also have a negative impact on the USD. Some businesses accept it, others are scared away because of inconsistent tax rules or propaganda from MSM, those are just attempts to stop something that cannot be stopped, unless of course we get a global permanent power outage while aliens attack from space, which is not very likely.</li>
<li>Bank money: just a number in a regular ordinary SQL database built in the 90's, with a backup on tape in the same room in best case scenario. This generic platform was never designed for handling currency and has multiple times been hacked and funds have disappeared without trace. It's like putting cash in your mattress then attempting to play Russian roulette with a lighter and a can of gas, sooner or later it says poof, then it's all gone. Or maybe the government just decides you're a domestic terrorist, poof your money is gone. Gates and the other elites want Banks to be the only alternative, because it gives them unreasonable amounts of control.</li>

<p>Also, buy Bitcoin. As a hedge against inflation but also because it is decentralized. Bill Gates doesn’t like it because he can’t control it and he can’t control how much money we make off it.</p>

        <p>I'd put my money on Monero too, dynamic block size provides a great balance between transaction fees and on chain spam prevention. ASIC resistance, great way to keep China and their specially designed chips (which are already faster than quantum computers) away. And best of all, complete anonymity, even tho all transactions happens on chain, they can't be traced, unless you know the view key, which just like the private key should be your own secret.</p>

        <p>They've been trying to get rid of cryptocurrency for over a decade, using every single method available. Daily propaganda in MSM, fear against it, exchange price manipulation, they probably even run many of the scams themselves, like the new versions of the Nigerian prince letters.</p>
<p>If they truly planned to use it all along, they've been doing a hell of a great job pretending that was never the plan. This raises questions like: did they also invent SQL databases? did they invent most programming languages? did they invent the internet itself? No I don't think so.</p>
<p>Globalists are by definition anti towards anything new, especially things they don't understand or things they realize can be a threat towards their evil plans, which is exactly what crypto is, by providing an alternative to big banks, even in a future when they get rid of cash completely.</p>
<p>They're genuinely changing their minds now, once they realize how they can take advantage of crypto too, just like anyone can. See where this is going? Internet was just a fly back in the days, then they realized, heck if we put news on the internet the distribution gets cheaper, and people won't have local copies anymore, makes it easier to alter the history.</p>
<p>Same goes for crypto. M$ want to build their social credit system, why building that on a centralized expensive cluster of servers using old generic tech that could easily be hacked, when you could build your social credit system on a blockchain, for free, unsinkable and un hack-able. </p>
<p>See where this is going, they learned about the new tech and how they can use it for oppression, just like they learned how they can use internet or SQL databases for oppression, that doesn't make the tech itself a bad thing, all this tech is mostly used for good things. You just have to understand it, what it is, and how it works.</p>

        <p>My paper and the Real Currencies paper are short, did you read them? The problems are that cryptocurrencies are deflationary (good for creditors and early adopters, bad for debtors and late adopters), already owned in large part by the elite (not really different in that regard from gold and fiat, but see point 1), and are being pushed to create a digital currency that supplants cash. The fact that they are as yet unregulated does not mean that that will remain the case - see the US Treasury Department seeking to make all digital wallets identifiable.</p>
<p>In the interests of full disclosure, I hold Cardano, but that is because I decided pragmatism will get me further than idealism, not because I think cryptos will liberate humanity from the banksters. I am also a programmer, albeit younger, so let me ask you this: are you quite certain that it will always be possible to make truly anonymous (not psuedonymous) transfers on blockchain using cross-chain interoperability standards and privacy coins? </p>
<p>My concern is that, in the spirit of omnipresent surveillance, blockchain currencies will make all financial transactions 100% legible to governments and intelligence agencies. Can you name one widely adopted financial technology or instrument from the past 100 years that actually increased the freedom of normal people over time? Credit cards didn't, financial derivatives helped cause the 2008 crash, and most stock trading is now handled by algorithms moving billions of dollars around at once. </p>
<p>I think it is very naive to believe that cryptocurrencies will have a positive impact on the lives of average people in the long term. You can read Miles' guest paper that actually names all the elites backing the Bitcoin project.</p>

        <p>Good answer, tho deflation isn't really a requirement for a cryptocurrency. You could reverse the algorithm. making the supply grow bigger over time, but then it would also lose it's value. Permanently fixed supply is yet another solution which comes with it's own problems as well. </p>
<p>I don't know which method is right or wrong, but one thing is sure, the goal was to remove the control from a central authority regulating the supply as it's currently too hard to create a working algorithm for that.</p>
<p>There will always be ways to remain anonymous, even if it's illegal, and even if most people don't know how to become anonymous. And just because they know you have crypto doesn't mean they could easily take it away from you.</p>
<p>&rt;are you quite certain that it will always be possible to make truly  anonymous (not psuedonymous) transfers on blockchain using cross-chain  interoperability standards and privacy coins?</p>
<p>In one way or another yes, it might not be cheap or easy, but definitely possible for anyone who needs it. Tho physical mediums of exchange might be a better chose, crypto would still be the best digital asset for anonymous payments online.</p>
<p>&rt;My concern is that, in the spirit of omnipresent surveillance,  blockchain currencies will make all financial transactions 100% legible  to governments and intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>It's a drawback with decentralized system, that everything must leave a trace. However, as long as that trace cannot be linked directly to you, you're safe from being tracked. Multiple wallets with no connection to each others is one way to accomplish this. Never reuse a receive address is another way to preserve privacy.</p>
<p>&rt;Can you name one widely adopted financial technology or instrument from  the past 100 years that actually increased the freedom of normal people  over time? Credit cards didn't, financial derivatives helped cause the  2008 crash, and most stock trading is now handled by algorithms moving  billions of dollars around at once.</p>
<p>Unfortunately not, because there is none. Banks, credit cards, stocks and stuff like that are all part of the same corrupt system tho so I wouldn't expect any kind of solution to ever come from the government. One could argue that gold provided some freedom to normal people, even tho deflation often lead to a few rich people hoarding it into their vaults.</p>
<p>&rt;I think it is very naive to believe that cryptocurrencies will have a  positive impact on the lives of average people in the long term. You can  read Miles' guest paper that actually names all the elites backing the  Bitcoin project.</p>
<p>I don't think it's the ultimate solution to everything as a currency, but I do think it will help many people on the way, it will provide decentralized apps, free speech, smart contracts and many other tools needed to reclaim freedom. I'm also sure the elites will run their tools of oppression on the same decentralized networks, because A: it's cheaper, and B they don't want to get fucked over by hackers obviously.</p>

<p>Piss off and enjoy your money like a normal person and stop trying to control the planet. Just because he made billions from other people's ideas and now gives millions to researchers doesn't make him an expert on everything. </p>
<p>Also, Media, ask him why he's buying up all the farmland?</p>

        <p>He’s actually out of control, it’s scary how no one sees it. Anyway this makes me want to learn about bitcoin even though I’ve always written it off as too complicated or too much money for average people.</p>

        <p>Do your research first, make sure that if you buy crypto it's actually a decentralized currency, not all of them are at this point. Blockchain in centralized control is one of the worst new tools of oppression out there. So just make sure any crypto you buy is truly decentralized. And be ready to get out if said currency becomes the target of a coordinated attack (I don't mean hacking but coordinated refusal to accept from major retailers)</p>
