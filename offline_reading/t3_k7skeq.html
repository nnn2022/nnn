        <p>It’s so fucking annoying seeing my cities subreddit. Everyone just echoes everyone else’s sentiment, if anyone questions that “were all gonna die” and “the darkest winter” they’re downvoted to all hell and told so many nasty things. The total mortality in October 2020 was less than October 2019. There are no excess deaths.. if you’re concerned or immunocompromised, stay home. If not, let the rest of us be.. this shit isn’t gonna go away. It’s always gonna have the risk of being caught, and someone getting it fatally. There’s risk in everything.</p>
<p>I’m just sick of being surrounded by idiots in this city that are just lemmings to whoever has the most updoots. Maybe think for a second when someone challenges you to think instead of shutting them down. We’re not just all blathering idiots. We see things like we do for a reason.</p>

        <p>Yep, happens all over reddit.</p>
<p>It seems if you diverge just one degree from the official "mass-mob point of view", you get downvoted to hell.</p>
<p>I guess critical thinking has been killed.</p>
<p>My other theory is that all the frustration people are having has to be released somewhere, and it's easy to blame anyone who "does not stand in line to do everything against covid".</p>

        <p>They've been effectively weaponized. Violently attacking anyone with a different opinion. Its scary how much it's becoming like a zombie movie or invasion of the body snatchers. I feel like this is probably some kind of test. To keep ourselves from stooping that low is the goal. Not to give into rage. Its tough.</p>

        <p>Social media is cancer. If it weren't for that (including sites like reddit), it would be incredibly difficult for them to push this fear and paranoia. People just wouldn't go to the effort of going out of their home - in the cold, no less - to agitate and convince others. Indeed, any kind of quarantine would also have the simultaneous effect of killing anybody's awareness of the problem.</p>

        <p>The "dark winter" rhetoric is bothersome to me, as Dark Winter was aapparently a 2001 pandemic simulation similar to Event 201 last October. But for smallpox instead of a coronavirus.</p>

<p>The CDC. Go compare week 40 from 2019 and 2020. Even with COVID it’s less deaths overall</p>

<p>Yes, that is indeed something your cult believes.</p>
<p>&rt;You’re telling me you trust the media over the CDC?</p>
<p>Nope. I trust Reuters (because they're unbiased, since their reporting comes straight from the AP with no spin attached) and I also trust the CDC. The article I linked to isn't contradictory of what the CDC reported. Why didn't you read the article I linked to?</p>

        <p>I just finished reading Animal Farm. The covidiots of today are EXACTLY like the sheep. They mindlessly repeat the shit that’s taught to them over and over and over again, interrupting anyone who tries to tell them facts. The saddest part is, everyone I know is like this. My family, my close friends. I feel almost completely alone. All logic has gone to shit</p>

        <p>I was in target last week and this young girl in the checkout line turns around to harass a women in her 70/80s behind her for not being 6 feet away. First off the woman was at least 5 feet away already and had a mask on, as the store requires unfortunately. I can’t even explain how angry this made me. I tried very hard to mind my own business but eventually I blurted out “No ones forcing you to be here, they have online shopping and car side pickup for people like you”. I was with my toddler son so I left it at that because I did not want to cause a scene and be the “crazy” one. My blood was boiling though, I could never imagine being so disrespectful and condescending to my elders. I’m starting to despise living in a large liberal city more and more.</p>

        <p>I had a similar experience in October when I went hiking up a mountain trail with my brother one day (both of us maskless). 80% of other hikers were masked up. When we were going back down the trail, we passed by a couple going the opposite direction, and as we approached, the woman, who had her mask down, pulled it back up. I gave her a "wtf" look because that was just stupid. So paranoid. I honestly can't wrap my mind around how anyone can hike up a MOUNTAIN trail, a rather strenuous exercise, with their breathing so impaired. Wouldn't be surprised if most of those maskers were suffering mild hypoxia.</p>

        <p>Kinda reminds me of my mother-in-law. For a good long while until maybe my husband asked her to stop, she'd put on her mask maybe 15 minutes before she even left the house. She'd be sitting in my husband's truck, he'd be the only other person within however many feet, and she'd wear her mask for an hour-long ride even though we all live together under the same roof and hug each other quite frequently. At least she acknowledges that masks probably don't help, but she's torn between "it's something" and "it's for others" or some shit.</p>

        <p>Yeah i've seen a lot of that conflicting mentality and it's just odd lol I think it stems from them thinking masks are 100% effective at preventing spread. But yeah I genuinely don't get the purpose of wearing them outdoors, in your car or when you're around people you live with. In stores and crowded areas, sure. But around people you live with and in wide open areas? Nope.</p>

        <p>My kids' Highlights magazines now show all the characters in masks...including little kids.  They just started doing this in November, and it ticks me off.  We're surrounded every day by people in real life wearing masks-- are they afraid that an unmasked character in a kids' magazine will spark a revolt?</p>
<p>The magazine was a gift from a grandparent,  or else my kids wouldn't be reading it.  I don't remember it being nearly as woke when I was a kid.</p>

        <p>That really sucks to hear. Somehow doesn't surprise me that some of these magazines are trying to do the stupid pro-doomer messaging, myself. I'll just ignore Highlights from now on, myself.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel better, I find it awesome I saw quite a few kids running and walking around yesterday both on Wicker Park streets, and within Humboldt Park when I was doing a hybrid walk and bike ride(was more doing biking in Humboldt). Even a few mothers were walking outside(more noticeable in Humboldt Park though not wearing masks while walking, but that didn't surprise me) without a mask, so that made me glad not everyone has been brainwashed by the doomer propaganda. And as you probably can guess, Chicago without a doubt has more doomers than a lot of other places(will say San Francisco Bay Area sounds worser than Chicagoland, from online reports I read about doomerism there.....). Of course for some people, I worry there isn't anything that can be done to get some of those very brainwashed doomer people to wake up anytime soon that they've been had.....</p>

        <p>I was walking into the mall with my parents today and they were wearing muzzles but I refused. Right after we walk in my dad yells at me to “ put my damn mask on before somebody sees me” like I was about to get taken away by the CCP themselves if I didn’t put my muzzle on. He started yelling at he to just wait in the car. It’s a shame what watching CNN all day does to your brain.</p>

        <p>Be prepared, everybody, because the anti-Christmas commercials have begun coming on sooner than I thought. I can’t take it anymore, I literally just turn off the TV when it happens.  “We know it will be difficult this year, but this is not the time for leaving your house, traveling, going to church or seeing your family.”  They pretend to care so much about our well-being, when they’ve ruined three holidays already and the rest of our livelihoods and small businesses.</p>
<p>My family will very likely not be coming to visit for Christmas, because they are deathly afraid and worship what the governors say.  Whenever they call me, I have to pretend I’m not living a normal life.  They’ve cancelled their gym memberships, stopped going to Mass, stopped hanging out with their friends, and are basically hunkered down until the vaccine comes.  And the funny part?  2 out of the 4 people in that house have already had COVID (had symptoms and tested positive), and they were both extremely mild cases.  The 2 that had it also tested positive for antibodies, so they’re immune for the time being.  But nope, still too scared, so I will likely be doing nothing for all three major holidays this year.  The only one that slightly made sense to cancel was Easter because COVID was still so new to all of us, but no excuse to cancel “just one” Christmas.  My aunt and cousin tested positive the week of Thanksgiving, so that made sense too, but no excuses for Christmas.  I’m so ashamed of my doomed family (and of the brigaders that will probably come to the sub and crucify me now for writing this).</p>

        <p>It's cool seeing your username when I just finished a chapter in a winter solstice mythology book about green winter kings fighting winter for the spring maiden - stories people have held onto for centuries for hope that spring will come after winter, light after dark, life after death, energy after hibernation (in our case, forced from lockdowns). It might seem random, but I just felt a little jolt from your green god name, and the shadow cast over Christmas, after what I had just read. It's sad that your family doesn't appreciate your festive spirit, but I hope you win a better season ahead like a green winter king :)</p>

        <p>Both sides of my family have canceled Christmas. My college age nieces sent individual emails telling me how wrong it is. They seriously believe they will die. </p>
<p>It depressed me terribly. This will never end. A few people have said “oh sure it’s all going back to normal” and they mean in March. How do I make it until then? </p>
<p>A lot of lives were interrupted by WWII. I’m sure there were point where a wife felt like “damn it! I want him home now!!”  When he got home, he wasn’t the same, but neither was she. This lockdown is similar. Nobody is going to be the same after it’s over. Except we aren’t defeating fascism in Europe and whatever Japan was up to. What bothers me the most is how pointless it all is. The survival rate is huge. It’s all a sham. Why are we sacrificing? Why do I have my whole life gone now?</p>

        <p>Yesterday I had a heated argument with two policemen in my city. They wanted me to wear a mask in between my running. I was visibly irritated from the get-go and tried to dodge them. I should point out that masks are mandatory everywhere here and you're been met with a $300 fine if you don't have one. Exercise outdoors is, of course, excluded from this mandate.</p>
<p>One of the policemen threatened me with a fine and for what, for being irritable? I instantly retorted with "Well, that's some nice authoritarianism right there". He kept pushing me to wear a mask and said that right now as I'm speaking to him I should be wearing one. I said if it weren't for your interruption, I would be speaking to no one and just going about my running. </p>
<p>I was waiting for the green light across the street from him, completely ALONE and he said that despite me exercising and all, as I was waiting I could have infected someone. AS I WAS WAITING ALL ALONE AND AS A HEALTHY PERSON, I COULD INFECT A HYPOTHETICAL SOMEONE. Of course I pointed out the lack of logic in his argument and said well, then, why are you taking my ID with those same gloves that you check 1500 other IDs and the other policeman offered me a huge bottle of hand sanitizer (CLOWN WORLD). I said, I'm fine, I don't come in contact with anyone, you do, and you know, I have an immune system for that. </p>
<p>I still wonder how I managed to dodge the fine since the policemen in my country are notorious for being corrupted, power hungry nuts. Either way, I won't comply and I won't make any concessions. I will stand my ground and I refuse to live in fear. Feels like a great small win!</p>

        <p>Where is this? For comparison, the cops in Boston don't give a fuck. A few weeks ago I was walking downtown with my wife and toddler and a cop noticed my kid pointing at the cop car (he's obsessed with cars and trucks). The cop got out, greeted us, and asked if my son wanted to sit in the car and play with the lights. He had a blast. We weren't wearing masks but offered to do so. The cop laughed and said don't worry about it.</p>

        <p>Oh and I am getting disturbed noticing the increase in mask wearing. </p>
<p>Our case numbers went up because everyone and their not dead grandmas went to go get tested for the holidays and so now everyone is freaking out thinking we actually have more cases when duh, more tests = more cases and we had one of the lowest testing rates for months.</p>
<p>I can see people actively avoiding me while I'm out on my daily nature adventures. It really sucks because this is the kind of place people always say hello and stop and chat and people aren't doing that anymore. </p>
<p>Masks really are a psychological muzzle. When people wear masks they become afraid of speaking. It becomes hard to be heard and all that has a symbolic representation. </p>
<p>Other than that there's the effect of not receiving a smile in return to your smile so you feel rejected or like you're doing something wrong. Thats double important in places like the U.S where we smile more than others.</p>

        <p>I feel the same. I teach a dance fitness class as a part-time job at weekends. When we came back from the first lockdown in the spring, the gyms I teach in were an oasis of normality with no masks, just  bit of ridiculous theatre about one-way systems (SARS-CoV-2 is completely thrown by people walking in the same direction. Apparently.) Now we have come back from the second lockdown and the gyms seem intent on taking all of the joy out of it. We are supposed to wear a mask when walking between rooms or in public areas and I have been told not to let people chat after class. I didn't wear a mask but it's only a matter of time before I am pulled up on it. One lady walked back to her car to get her mask (a round trip of five minutes or so) rather than walk the twenty meters to the studio without a mask.</p>
<p>I feel completely depressed about the whole situation now. I write on Quora and have been writing well-referenced articles for months. They are either ignored, or challenged with no engagement whatsoever with the issues. The papers I quote are just written off as coming from 'fringe' scientists, despite many of them being published in leading scientific publications like the Lancet or BMJ. There is absolutely no getting through to anybody.</p>
<p>So I am coming to the conclusion that I will never visit another country again, never go to a club, never be in a crowd anywhere again. This is it. We are stuck with this crap forever.</p>

        <p>It’s like talking to a cult member or challenging a diehard Christian on The Bible. That is how set in their ways most of these people have become. They don’t even see the irony of wishing death on anyone who dares question the mask mandates. They just flat out say they hope when you get it no doctor or hospital will agree to treat you and then gloat at how you’re going to die a horrible death and they “people like you” deserve nothing less. I’ve seen actual doctors post those sentiments on Twitter — doctors with accounts linking back to their real names and the hospitals they work at wishing actual death on people and they’re upvoted and shared and praised for saying this shit. Once upon a time, a time not too long ago, I would have imagined saying something like they in public could have cost you your job if not your medical license. Nope. Not in this new normal.</p>

        <p>I refuse to speak while wearing a mask simply because I can't stand people in masks just chit-chatting like everything is normal. So it seems I might not be speaking as much anymore; my husband started wearing a bandana over his face after Walmart security chased us through the store for not masking up, and I usually follow his lead because I have trouble reading a room. We would just boycott such stores, but we have very few other places to shop, as megacorporations have been destroying small businesses since long before we were born. So we'll do what we must to avoid being kicked out, assaulted, or arrested. Within certain limits, of course. He says people are noticeably more polite to him now that he's masking up, which makes me want to comply even less, because I don't really give a fuck if people are polite to me so long as they don't actively harass or assault me. This time last year, the cops might be called if I enter a gas station with a black bandana over my face. Now the cops might be called if my face ISN'T covered.</p>

        <p>My daughter wrote "face masks" on her Christmas wishlist. Sigh. That kinda hurt.  I've been feeling especially down, and checked out the Covid Support sub. People were blaming their depression on selfish antimaskers who won't follow the rules, since apparently that's what is making this virus worse. I backed out of there, and decided I'm probably best off channeling my energy into fighting these restrictions.</p>

        <p>I've given up on the people that scapegoat anti-maskers for every spike or outbreak that happens. I think people genuinely think cloth masks are 100% effective at preventing COVID spread... They're not, they're about 50% effective apparently. So even then, people wearing masks <em>can</em> and do transmit the virus too. But anytime i've pointed that out I just get downvoted to smithereens.</p>

        <p>And this is why I honestly think online school might be better than in-person school with the current regulations, though I understand different families having different wants and needs. How does your mother feel about the issue? If she's sympathetic to our perspective, maybe she could make some low-key subversive/dissident designs? Nothing that'll get your daughter in trouble of course, just maybe some cartoony thing inspired by 1984 or Brave New World. So long as the kid likes the design.</p>

        <p>Oh I wish! Unfortunately my mother is full-on Doomer. I homeschooled my daughter for a few months rather than do online school this fall, after the spring disaster. In-person has actually been pretty okay (month or so in) because kids/parents can still choose virtual-only, and it seems that most did choose that. So it's small class sizes and a relatively chill environment.</p>

        <p>Eh, could be worse. Large class sizes are one of the biggest problems with our modern school system. It seems that we're at a crossroads regarding education and perhaps society as a whole: we have this crackdown in an attempt to homogenize thought and behavior, but there is also this decentralist/DIY backlash. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.</p>

        <p>I just gotta say - I never realized how much the media can skew things. My fiance and I were out shopping on the weekend, and there was an anti-mask protest, so we stopped to listen/observe for a bit, as we both strongly believe the cause. It was a huge crowd (500 +) people, and I felt SO nervous being in a crowd. But then I stopped and thought to myself, this is normal, a year ago I wouldn't have cared; but now the media has driven it into people how bad crowds are, etc. I'm just ready for this bullshit to be over with. I'm so over masks - I have asthma and cannot breathe properly while wearing one, but I feel so forced, like I have no other choice.</p>

        <p>I was turned down from a job because I stated my preference to work in the office if at all possible, but that I could work from home temporarily if necessary.</p>
<p>I haven't lost my job, I only took a minor salary cut, and my car broke down so this is actually perfect timing to work from home. However... I'm losing my goddamn mind working from home for the past 9 months. I've gained 20 lbs, I drink a fifth of liquor every day or two, my sleep schedule is fucked up, I wake up crying randomly realizing I don't have a reason to leave my tiny apartment.</p>
<p>The only way to make working from home tolerable is to move out of this 700 sq ft apartment. Of course, my company doesn't pay me enough to really make that feasible. Plus, I keep thinking about Office Space - "why should I move, they're the ones who suck." Why should I find a new apartment when my previous work/life balance was perfect? I didn't volunteer to have to two realities collapsed onto each other. Plus I'm young and healthy and am more likely to die driving to the office than from contracting COVID in the office.</p>
<p>This is the new normal I'm most afraid of. Millions of young professionals who are forced to learn their job remotely, get along with colleagues through a webcam, and even if they let loose and have a virtual happy hour they have to worry that their employer is recording the whole thing.</p>

<p>I absolutely HATE the concept of working from home. My ENTIRE routine is thrown off by this. I find it EXTREMELY hard to be as productive as I would be in an actual WORK-Environment. I had a rude awakening to remind me of these things I feel so deeply, because my job made me (kind of) work from home for three weeks while quarantined because my ROOMMATE...who I never even interact with face-to-face...got the virus. So, yeah I feel you SO hard, and ESPECIALLY on the getting fat part lmao...</p>

        <p>I got canned from a WFH job and recently took a lower paying in office job (everybody gotta eat). I have learned more in 2 weeks than I did in the 2 years I was at my remote job. I feel like an asshole cuz I can't learn a fucking thing over Zoom and Skype. I feel terrible for all the kids trying to learn long division, algebra, etc through video. It's damn near impossible.</p>

        <p>I had to do virtual learning for being an election judge in November, and thought that was HELL to do. Thank goodness we election judges were able to do an in person class back in like January/February, so I still remember very well how to use all the equipment.</p>
<p>I feel very sorry for public school kids, being forced to do nonstop Zoom style virtual learning for their school classes as of now. The Chicago Teacher's Union really should allow in person classes to resume in Feburary 2021(as CPS is proposing), but just watch I know CTU will overly whine about it like they always do for EVERYTHING. I bet they'd whine, even if CPS were to propose that by February 2021 that they'd only go over to a hybrid model of doing both Zoom and some in person classes(it's all Zoom as of Dec. 2020). Even a few CTU leadership people for whatever silly reason a few years ago, met up with some people in the country of Venezuela's government(yes the same one Hugo Chavez led at one time, not sure if he still leads them today but supposedly I think I heard he may've passed on leadership to someone else?) for whatever weird reason. Shows how messed up their priorities(those leading CTU) are.....</p>

Why is it that the only person around here who wants to go out with me and do things is 81!!! Old people do <em>not</em> want to stay home, stay safe. They want to get out and participate in society!

        <p>I think by that age many people have gotten used to having interests and beliefs that are not mainstream, and therefore put less stock in what other people around them are doing.  They have seen a lot of trends come and go.  I hope you have an enjoyable time!</p>

        <p>That sounds amazing! Wish I could suddenly relocate to an area where people were more against this pro-doomer crap. In IL, it's ridiculous how many are brainwashed by the doomer stuff. I imagine in rural IL and away from more populated places people don't give a crap, but it's more than I prefer in the Chicago area. I'm always surprised when I have a rare sighting of someone without a mask while walking outside......</p>

        <p>Finally went into a grocery store in a very doomerish part of Birmingham with no mask. Didn't have any issues. There were probably less than 20 shoppers so that may have helped. I plan on continuing to push the envelope hoping it will encourage others to follow suit.</p>

<p>Also on the way home, it looked like(via a very quick glance as I passed by) I noticed a dive bar that was defying the rules, and still being open. So that was nice to see, especially in very doomer Chicago. Even had a talk with my friend who had to take a vehicle to a body shop in one of the nearby suburbs a few days ago, and he also told me he passed by several dive bars defying Prickster's temporary ban on indoor dining/drinking and remaining open.</p>

        <p>As much as I dislike r/coronavirus , I know criticism of the doomer perspective sometimes gets through in comments section to things posted there. From others who do check this very closely(I don't, but there are a few on r/lockdownskepticism who check over time changes in behavior and feelings there), not all such comments daring to criticize the doomer norm are getting as greatly downvoted as they more heavily were on coronavirus in the past. So I'd say there's at least a small change, as of recent.</p>

        <p>I'm not a religious person per se, but this Christmas I am praying for a divine intervention of some kind. I don't think humans are going to be able to navigate this on their own, not without some kind of help.</p>
<p>I've always accepted some baseline level of evil in the world - people who want to control others, want to stamp out freedom and the human spirit on a large scale - but generally it seemed at least somewhat tamed. Yeah, there will always be dictators and corrupt politicians and widespread exploitative behavior, but generally their negative influence is limited in time and space, and there's usually someplace else you can escape to (with some extreme exceptions, like North Korea).</p>
<p>But the situation in so-called democratic countries right now seems pretty dire, especially because they are acting more or less in lockstep. With social media, propaganda and social engineering has been nearly perfected, and (as mentioned in others' comments) the common man has been weaponized as an enforcer of whatever the people in charge want. It's a lot easier to resist some far-off despot than 50% of your next door neighbors, especially when they are clamoring in unison for harsher, stricter oversight of personal existence - the governments of the world are <em>only too happy</em> to oblige.</p>
<p>Is this it? Are we in the terminal stages of modern civilization, at least where individual liberty is concerned? Will this new medical-responsibility-for-others be used as the ultimate, unappealable excuse to bring about the dystopia we always suspected was possible in a technologically advanced world? In the past, thinkers with a skeptical eye toward government overreach cautioned that we might be heading TOWARD a fully-elaborated 1984-type situation, off in the distance somewhere, maybe with certain aspects of that world more or less tangible in the here and now. But are we about to cross over a very clearly defined threshold, from a definite 'before' to a definite 'after'? Where nobody will be able to deny that the world of 2019 is gone forever, with no hope of it ever returning?</p>

        <p>I'm a student and I moved into university housing this fall with one roommate (the school assigned us; we didn't get choices). This roommate is great; lovely person. Before we moved in together, she made it clear that we were NOT going to have guests in the apartment because of COVID. This was back in August and I was already over isolation and lockdown for quite a while, but I conceded and recognized that everyone might not be comfortable, that there are genuine risks, whatever. I agreed.</p>
<p>Despite being terrified of COVID, manifested in sanitizing any packages that come through our door, showering as soon as she gets back from going out, refuses to take public transportation in our large city, sanitizing every door knob in our home, and wearing a mask outdoors when absolutely no one else is around, <strong>she goes out with friends all the time.</strong> To restaurants, museums, parks, shops, you name it. But she wears a mask, so it's okay! Right?</p>
<p>My friend is a nurse in training and wanted to visit to see my new apartment. I told her that my roommate wasn't having guests. My nurse friend has no problem hugging me, has no problem wanting to come over to my house. She's finished with clinicals so not in contact with any patients who even (might) have COVID.</p>
<p>And yet....while my roommate goes out nonstop with her friends, I can't have <em>one friend</em> over to our home.</p>
<p>Another funny little tidbit about this: she constantly tells me about the cases going up and how COVID has ruined everything....she once made plans to go out with a certain friend whose roommate had tested positive for COVID but was asymptomatic. Her friend went to go get tested a couple of days before they were set to hang out. My roommate proceeds <strong>to look for any evidence of how many false positives there are with COVID tests. She was looking for any excuse to be able to meet up with her friend, including looking at the statistics for false positives.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I cannot even begin to tell you all how this pissed me off (internally, I'm not one to show anger).</strong></p>
<p>Ranting and raving and acting terrified of COVID and about people whose heads she wants to "bash into a wall" (actual thing she has said) because they don't wear the masks <em>outside</em>...and yet she's trying to find any excuse to be able to justify going out with someone who might have a positive test.</p>
<p>Anyone else have someone like this in their life? The sheer illogical-ness of all of this is seriously making me question my sanity. Like, not even in a "Haha I'm so crazy" sort of way but in a "Am I mentally ill for questioning all of this when everyone I tend to align with politically is so gung ho about everything...am I a heartless, sociopathic bitch?" I'm even afraid to bring up my Lockdown Skepticism with my therapist (which is why I'm writing here...I need to vent).</p>

        <p>I miss seeing people smile. There is a prevailing feeling of fear when I go to work makes me want to just stay home.  I hate wearing the masks especially the n95.  The thing is hot and uncomfortable.  And if you happen to sneeze while wearing one your smelling your sinus cavity for the rest of the day.  The PPE gowns don’t breathe very well so I’m hot all day even thou the thermostat is set to 65.  The forced air to create a negative air pressure area is very loud you have to shout to be heard if you are near the blower.  At my hospital we were losing about person a day.   One day we had two nurses and one aid for 15 patients.  I had to load a body into a body bag by myself that day.  I don’t like this. This isn’t normal.</p>

<p>He has followed everything perfectly. Never questioned masks, lockdowns, the vaccine. I tell him I haven't had the flu since I was ten years old, so I don't get the flu shot. He tells me I'll get it sooner or later because "everyone gets it at least twice".</p>
<p>Yes, <em>in sixteen years</em>, I don't get the flu, yet his only response is I eventually will. It's like he didn't consider his response before he sent it.</p>

        <p>How do people even end up in relationships with such antithetical views on major issues like this? Maybe we're weirdos, but my husband and I built our relationship on, not just hobbies and favorite music, but political and philosilophical views. We discussed these things in depth before we even knew each other's names. That's why I don't understand when people are so shocked that friends and family are driven apart over "just" politics: politics and philosophy shape our world, including our individual everyday lives. How could anyone genuinely trust or respect someone who would have governments and corporations strong-arm them into sacrificing their personal privacy or medical freedom?</p>

        <p>My husband and I have always aligned on our political and philosophical views for the most part. But this spring we were both a little worried about covid. Ok, he was really paranoid and was wearing a mask before they were mandatory. It didn't take me long to start researching and as we found out more about it all I was a lot less concerned. It became a big point of contention for us... But after months of debates (usually they were civil) sending him articles and videos, my husband is once again the man I've always known and loved. He has always been very libertarian, pro-gun, pro-freedom, etc... So the few months where he went along with all the restrictions and masks willingly was definitely strange. I'm so thankful he's come around and is saying he's exempt from masks anywhere he goes. He's even inviting all our family for Christmas dinner even though all gatherings are banned here. 
So tl:dr you might align in your opinions with you SO or you might not always... People can change their mind, for good or for bad. Just glad my husband finally took the red pill on this.</p>

        <p>I wonder if he had some underlying health anxiety? That's usually when my husband and I have disagreements on political/philosophical issues: we don't, not really, but one of us might feel too physically or mentally unfit to live up to our ideals. So I wonder if maybe your husband was so paranoid of the virus because perhaps he felt vulnerable to sickness at the time, whether or not it was actually true. Something similar happened to my husband several years ago after an ear infection - and more importantly - his aunt and mother coercing him into medical treatments that resulted in him going from his peak of physical fitness to losing roughly 30 pounds in a month or so. We had many disagreements over things we did and still do agree on, but only because his health concerns made him vulnerable to attacks on his ideals. He got better. Not entirely, but most of it is just that quarter-life crisis now.</p>

        <p>Well my husband does really hate getting sick. Our 4 kids and I all got a bad flu last Christmas and my husband pretty much stayed away from us, washed his hands constantly and didn't get sick. He credits this with him not getting the flu even though it may have just been that he was immune to it already or something. But once the gov started mandating social distancing, hand washing, masks, etc it kind of catered to his slightly germophobic nature and so he just followed along with it. I'm not going to lie, he still sanitizes the grocery cart, not even because of covid so much as stomach bugs or whatever else he thinks might be lurking there. Haha. BUT, he's totally against the mandates and restrictions now and we're going to a protest in our city tomorrow!</p>

        <p>Hey, to each their own! I'd sanitize the grocery cart too, if I cared enough to keep sanitizer on me, but I sure as hell ain't using whatever sanitizer the store offers. Any trust I ever had for governments and corporations - which wasn't very much to begin with - has pretty much gone out the window this year. I'm a big baby when I'm sick, though I keep it between me and my husband precisely because I don't trust anyone else to not violate my personal privacy or medical freedom especially when I'm in such a vulnerable state.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that, but I just totally ignore doomer viewpoints(and those brainwashed into this position) at this point. Funny enough like a week ago I overheard a phone conversation with my brother and my parents, and I really did NOT fregging appreciate him essentially throwing me and one of my brother's wife sisters under the bus, due to him unnecessarily worrying about both of us for all he may know being COVID-positive. And I'm damn sure from what I see of my brother's wife sister posting things on her social media, that more than likely she isn't sick.</p>
<p>I have no doubt he likely wouldn't have talked like that on the phone, if it wasn't for the brainwashing on the media(and by all these lockstep dictator governors, Cuomo, Murphy, Cooper, Whitmer, Pritzker, Lujan Grisham, btw at times Baker seems like the same, etc) that has shamefully been done to discourage even within family gatherings. The thing that blew my mind when I looked at older picture memory card pics last night, is that I had weirdly forgotten my brother and brother's wife actually did visit our house around Labor Day of this very year. Back then you still could do indoor dining in Illinois(that ended in all regions in late October, the Illinois Restaurant Association just began a lobbying campaign this week to try for 20% indoor occupancy to Prickster by early 2021 but who knows if he'll grant that, at least until the positivity rate falls below 8%), and do other things now not allowed by the newer November mitigations(triggered at 12% or above, these include movie theaters, gyms, casinos/strip mall video game parlors, and I think a few other types of businesses?). Retail stores didn't have to close down due to the mid-November IL mitigations, but had to reduce their capacity to 25% vs. their normal, and grocery stores at 50%.</p>
<p>I wish that guy would realize shopping at traditional non-Amazon stores is better(both physical and online), and that honestly he only should shop at Amazon as a last resort if he can't find that item anywhere else.</p>

        <p>Sports have been completely ruined. Covid is the almighty god of the sports world and calls all the shots. All sports reporting now is “so and so player tested positive for Covid-19” and “so and so game is cancelled due to virus concerns.” ESPN is the worst with this and it just feels like watching CNN because all they talk about is Covid and how scared of the virus I am supposed to be. Then the games themselves are full of security theater. Players wearing masks on the sidelines, empty stadiums, announcers broadcasting from different booths or standing far apart from each other, fake crowd noise, etc. I am a huge sports fan but it is all unwatchable this year because it’s all just Covid this and Covid that.</p>

        <p>the bay area is going under the more strict lockdowm orders even though the icu 15% occupation limit hasn't been reached. </p>
<p>so basically they're saying we can lock you down whenever we want for any arbitrary reason. I really hope business owners protest. </p>
<p>the hard thing about this is you really will get grandma killer accusations for opposing this because they got smart and directly tied the orders to icu capacities, when icu beds were always in short supply.</p>

        <p>I saw that virus get brought up on a sports sub and of course you have the Redditor replying "I had COVID it caused pancreatitis" and of course someone replies "Oh wow I didn't know it could cause pancreatitis" nobody stopped to question that perhaps this person already had pancreatitis and getting COVID lead to an examination which revealed pancreatitis... Can you imagine saying that some other year during flu season? "I had the flu it caused high blood pressure and diabetes" they'd call you a fat shit. Instead these bizarre medical conclusions get drawn with the covid as they rationalise all the fear and paranoia, people are relieved to learn of these "side-effects" they didn't 't know of as it furthers their fear, it's unsettling.</p>

        <p>no, I realize that many have a different opinion, but I also notice how that particular subreddit is run, and how dissenting opinion doesn't ever get any traction there</p>
<p>the "foreign power" thing is a stretch, but I do believe that there is meddling going on with moderation and administration, it doesn't take much to push an agenda even if it is not seen as such by those doing it</p>

        <p>I long ago realized that all those Reddit news subs suck. Whether it's news, worldnews, politics, etc., it's awful how the very slightest disagreement with the hivemind(even if for example say you're a moderate Democrat, and it isn't praising the progressive Democrat viewpoints) will get you a lot of dislikes and downvotes.</p>
<p>Don't forget about the number of bots, that one can see at times on Reddit. I don't think those are influencing public opinion, but people need to more independently think and realize the pro-doomer viewpoint isn't always accurate.</p>

        <p>I have no doubt some foreign powers do try in some small and hard to notice ways to the average person, to influence opinions on US social media sites. I.e. how Russia's government did that hidden Facebook campaign during the 2016 general election to paint Hillary Clinton as bad, and Donald Trump as good.</p>

        <p>I had a friend of mine in real life turn on me. Why? I told her that a friend of mine beat coronavirus after a week in the hospital. He had the “symptoms” and then they released him off the ventilator. So she then tells me that doctors go through a breathing rundown with the patients to see if they can breathe on their own. Anyway that’s not the fucking story I heard. I heard that if you are able and better. They will release you, and tell you to get some rest. Why is that these goddamn fact checkers addicted to NPR and CNN want to discredit anyone for having a different narrative???</p>

        <p>Came across a book today, "Alone Together" by Sherry Turkle. The title so closely resembled the Australian government's lockdown messaging (predictive programming, conspiracy folks?) but it gives an excellent rundown of the issues caused by technology, including social alienation and lack of substance in virtual interactions. Highly recommended.</p>

        <p>What did the other person suggest that you told them to 'fuck off' ?</p>
<p>Anyway, it would probably help if you explained more clearly what you consider 'hate'. A lot of redditors feel under-the-radar subs like this one are the epitome of 'hate', and that all the top subs are 'love wins' kind of places. So what does that word mean to you? What specifically are you hoping to avoid?</p>

        <p>I've been going to a therapist for the last month or 2. I'd been struggling, even before the lockdown. I finally reached out for some help a couple months ago. Began to open up to the therapist, making some progress. Then, I got a fever, so I stayed away for a week. Then I was waiting on covid testing, so I stayed away another week. Then, the next week, my slot was already booked. So, I missed 3 weeks of therapy.</p>
<p>Once I was back in the couch, so to speak, I get told that all in-person therapy is cancelled, but we can do the same over zoom.</p>
<p>I'm way too paranoid about transmitting my most sensitive thoughts and problems over the internet, with video and audio, for this to be a solution. How do you open up to a computer screen?</p>
<p>So, now I'm out of the self-improvement thing, and I guess I'll just resume the downward spiral.</p>

<p>This sets home. I would be doing the same thing and I always feel like there is huge massive contrast between person to person in real life in regards to virtual on a zoom. There is no connection like it is when it is real human interactions. I truly am so sorry for what you are going through.</p>

        <p>And in regards specifically to therapy, confidentiality is also a factor. I was in therapy for several of my school years, but I never trusted a counselor until a certain one I had in my last two years of high school. Why? She was the first one I had who I could actually talk to without worrying where my words would go (every previous counselor was required to report to my parents or other teachers). I didn't open up to her immediately, but if I thought for a moment what I say could leave that room, I wouldn't have spoken to her.</p>
<p>Zoom therapy means if you don't live alone, there's a good chance your roommates will hear everything between you and therapist, killing one of the most crucial parts of it.</p>

<p>&rt;And get this! The warehouse didn't have running water ANYWHERE all morning! If you needed to go to the bathroom and didn't have a car, you needed to clock out and go take the shuttle to [other] location. Bathrooms just recently reopened, but the sinks are still down!</p>
<p>So, COVID-19 is oh so terrible, but lack of running water isn't a health hazard at all!</p>
<p>Also, she's not doing her job because multiple departments are down due the conveyors breaking in the middle of the night. They are still not functioning, but my job refuses to send anyone home. Yep, this virus is soooooooo dangerous, no less than a thousand people must needlessly stay at work, even when the job itself isn't working!</p>

        <p>It depends on your relationship with each of them as individuals. As an example, if my husband wasn't already vaccine-skeptical, I'd just be honest and tell him that I don't want to hug, kiss, or have sex with a lab rat exuding who-knows-what in their bodily fluids, nor do I want either of our names on any current legal/medical records aside from a very select few. As for my nieces and nephews, there's nothing I can do because they aren't my children and I don't have the best relationship with my brother.</p>

        <p>Today is starting out kinda shitty.</p>
<p>I woke up needing to pee, but my mother-in-law went into the bathroom the moment I woke up. I fucking hate going into the bathroom after her because she stinks up the bathroom simply by pulling her pants down, leaves the door closed to trap heat and also that stink in the room, while leaving bloody purulent assprints and this weird sticky gray powder on the toilet seat. People call me selfish for not caring if they get COVID, but then they buy up all the disinfectant wipes so those who live in a household with someone who has MRSA or C Diff are at greater risk.</p>
<p>Then I walk down the hallway and notice mother-in-law is watching Good Morning America. Fucking lovely. My husband and I have been doing good keeping her from watching shit like that, but unless we wake up at the crack of dawn and stay awake until almost midnight, she WILL turn on the news or some talk show like a junkie waiting to sneak a fix. Of course the first thing I hear is something about the COVID vaccine, and I made a remark saying as much.</p>
<p>"Oh you know it. That's what they do."</p>
<p>"That's why we try to keep you from watching things like this."</p>
<p>"I know. But....I just....nevermind." </p>
<p>Yeah I know, you want to see the weather or some shit. Watch for the weather and stay for the rona. She goes on to flip through the 5 channels we get on the antenna, looking desperately for something to watch. Probably not even to watch, but for "background noise" while she scrolls through Facebook or plays the little slot machine game on her phone, which is even worse. The only thing worse than actively watching propaganda is passively allowing those words to seep into your subconscious. While I know they have their own flaws, I would much rather her watch funny cat videos on YouTube or maybe Punisher on Netflix than fucking Good Morning America. It's not like my husband and I didn't set up his PS3 in the living room specifically to distract his mother from her precious news and talk shows. It's not like she doesn't have 3+ weather apps on her phone that she could use instead of being passively spoonfed bullshit by the talking heads on TV.</p>
<p>Great, now I'm getting a headache. Maybe I'll try to sleep on-and-off for another hour if I can rest assured my mother-in-in-law will be watching something from pre-2020. Assuming I can sleep while she's gossiping on the phone at the top of her fucking lungs.</p>

        <p>With all the vaccine talk I'm starting to fear that you'll need the vaccine to travel internationally. And there'll be no way to fake it either with the record being electronic. My brother's wedding is next September. Being required to get a vaccine for an illness that is nearly zero risk to me and at that point will be so widely vaccinated against feels so viscerally wrong, but missing his wedding would be devastating.</p>

        <p>There IS a way to fake it if you can find a doctor willing to do it for you. For a suitable bribe, a dodgy doctor would be willing to order a vaccine for you, give you an appointment and just enter it into the computer record without actually injecting you.</p>

        <p>It may not be a risk for you, though it could be for any number of others on the plane. A vaccine is not 100% effective, especially with novel viruses. Usually, thinking about others is more important than your own fears about a mostly harmless shot. Not to mention the moral implications of intentionally misleading those in the same hypothetical flight as you, especially if  even one gets sick or dies.</p>

<li>I, and no one for that matter, can truthfully say they know it is 100% safe, with no side effects. However, I am also not just assuming it is safe. After doing my own research into how vaccine trials are ran, I am more comfortable with getting a vaccine.</li>
<li>I can’t speak for the chunk of humanity that is optimistic about a vaccine. With that said, I generally have faith in the scientific community. They have developed a probable vaccine for COVID-19 and I am much more willing to have nausea for a week (or some other side-effect), than getting sick or potentially dying of COVID. The virus is not being regarded pessimistically in my opinion. It’s being looked at realistically. Millions have died because of it; try telling shattered families that they’re just being pessimistic about COVID’s harmfulness. Many others have issues that may last for the rest of their life. Try telling them, “oh, you can’t remember much? It’s fine, you’re just being pessimistic.”</li>

        <p>How do you know it’s a “mostly harmless” shot? It’s literally impossible for ANYONE, even the top health authorities in the land, to legitimately claim that with any certainty, considering these vaccines have not even been widely tested, much less widely distributed. People with serious pre-existing conditions were excluded from the trials. Children were excluded from the trials. Even CBS news (which is about as MSM as it gets and is not a right-wing fear-mongering media outlet or a conspiracy group like Alex Jones) ran an article just yesterday about how nearly one third of the trial participants experienced severe side effects following the second dose to the degree many of them were hospitalized due to their symptoms.</p>
<p>And, again, the true scope of the side effects for this vaccine won’t be known until years down the line.</p>
<p>We’ve already been told that getting the vaccine will not change a person’s need to wear a mask. I’m guessing you believe strongly in masks and their effectiveness. Flying with a mask will likely be required for years to come, if not forever. So why do you think OP, who will be masked when flying to this wedding, is placing others at risk if masks are so effective?</p>

        <p>I should have been more clear- I am not saying I know that this vaccine is mostly safe. What I was meaning is that most vaccines are safe, with mild side effects. In my case, I generally have faith in the scientific community, and doing some research into how the vaccines are tested before distribution reaffirmed that trust in this case. I know that it is impossible for literally anyone to guarantee a vaccine to a novel virus is completely effective.</p>
<p>Could you link the CBS article? I’d love to take a look at it. Also, from my research, many news outlets, nationally and internationally, agree that the vaccine has been shown to be safe in the clinical trials.</p>
<p>Even after I get a vaccine, I would still wear a mask, and socially distance. You say “flying with a  mask will likely be required for years to come, if not forever”, when that’s simply not true. It will only last as long as there is a global pandemic. Even if it does for some reason it does become a requirement forever, that’s not a huge problem. It’s a piece of fabric. Not the boogeyman. There are a few key CDC guidelines, for a reason. I don’t believe that masks are 100% effective. Wearing them, while socially distancing, and staying at home as much as possible all help. Like any vaccine, this one isn’t 100% effective either. It may have some serious side-effects to a minority of its users. Yet it is another way of keeping yourself, and others, safe.</p>

        <p>Then that’s unfortunate. Look at how many people this virus has already killed though. I’m not being sarcastic or downplaying the loss of a life. I’m saying that the amount of people who will die as a result of the vaccine is still a fraction of what the virus has, and will continue to kill.</p>

        <p>My state has a new curfew for Friday, effective until 2200 - 0600; my grandmother wants to know why the Governor pick such a seemingly arbitrary time. Even after I told her it's about population control and subversion of the masses to make them obey, she still doesn't seem to get it. Guess some people are lost, but we knew that anyway.</p>

        <p>&rt;desperately searching for any damn reason</p>
<p>Why make it easy for tyrants - the big ones or the millions of little ones? Short of some major new disruption (eg WW3 with China), we're speeding along toward complacent submission into a textbook global dystopia.</p>
<p>If you (and many others I've seen here - this is also a response to them) have reached a point where life is simply not worth living, then the ultimate blackmail any human faces when considering non-compliance, is no longer usable against you. Incidentally, it's the same 'handle' being used to manipulate the masses, who are so terrified of DEATH that they will voluntarily throw their lives in the trash.</p>
<p>I am not advocating any specific action, but I'm saying, you and everybody else in that boat: use that ultimate psychological freedom to your advantage. It's one thing to go to the slaughter, and another to self-slaughter to save them the trouble. Yeesh! We're still AMERICANS, remember that at least. That hasn't meant much for a long time, but maybe it's time for it to mean something again.</p>
<p>Personally I'm waiting to see what transpires the rest of this month, and especially after January 20. That will give a clearer idea what kind of permanent world they're trying to herd us into. Or at least what level of political unrest to expect, especially from states (like Florida) that don't want any part of this shit anymore. Financially I am not in any position for a cross-country move, but we may be fast approaching a time when those considerations are a luxury.</p>
<p>Forced vaccinations (whether by kidnap or blackmail) are still a line in the sand for many, but governments seem intent on crossing it. At least give it some time to see what the reactions to that will be. It may inspire you.</p>
<p>And finally: the main reason anybody on our team - Team Freedom - is suffering, is because of isolation. If we could all magically be in the same city or same state, instead of scattered across the US under the paranoid eye of our neighbors - we would be living in a huge block party overnight. I strongly suspect that that's what the ultimate fate of the US is going to be - 2 separate countries, if not complete balkanization into independent states. The deep irony of the Connected Age is that it has made living in geographic proximity to political opponents nearly impossible, and we're about to have to do a mass 'defragmentation' just to sort humans into physical groups that can mostly agree with each other. Fuckin' wild!</p>
<p>Live to connect with those who feel EXACTLY like you do. Maybe 2020 will prove, in retrospect, to have been a blessing none of us could have imagined?</p>

        <p>Planny my wedding for next August and it really seems like it'll be impossible for my family and friends who live overseas to come. While I do think it's possible that some stuff, especially schools will reopen next year because of widespread lockdown fatigue, there doesn't seem to be a widespread desire for borders to reopen. Leftist elites will generally want everything to stay closed unless you're rich and famous and the rest of the country (US) is in a populist isolationist mood and don't mind keeping foreigners out, at best and are xenophobic at worst. </p>
<p>Keeping borders closed will probably be one of the only things Biden can do that will garner bipartisan support and I have no idea how or when I'll ever be able to see my grandparents again.</p>

        <p>So our new restrictions in PA took hold at midnight, and yet I got an email from my skating club saying they were having limited practice this morning. You had to prepay online and could only sign up for one hour; no walk-ins and you can’t stay the whole two hours like you normally can. I noticed also the rink kept a small amount of private rentals and adult hockey league games on the calendar for the coming week. Everything after next week is cleared, but I hope they don’t get busted since technically they are supposed to be closed and the other rink closed up shop yesterday. Even though I don’t agree with the shutdowns I do think they’re taking a risk by being sneaky and still allowing limited events. I just hope it works because I’d hate to lose my one outlet.</p>

        <p>Not exactly a rant against the irl issues I'm facing (although my county just reinstated it's mask policy despite not having one since August), but I feel as if I am losing my mind in this subreddit. Withing the past few weeks this place turned from nothing but data against the media's coronavirus narrative, and COVID rants to something a lot stupider and sheep-like. About a third of the comments in every thread here are from the shitty tin-foil hat conspiracy stereotypicals, pretty much the same dudes used as strawmen in arguments or comic relief in movies but these people are serious. This really sucks for me as this was the only online community where people are resisting the New Normal but I refuse to team up with loonies.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it sucks. But I'm at the point that I'd side with pretty much anyone as long as we have the common goal of stopping the hypochondriac society. I have noticed a rise in conspiracy theory shit and antivaxxing lately, and I don't like it one bit. But if this is the hand I've been dealt, then I'm going to play it. I'll go back to making fun of them when the hypochondriacs have been dealt with.</p>

        <p>I agree about conspiracy theorists muddying the waters, but it is quite understandable why people are embracing Bacofoil millinary. The whole situation is so insane that it is quite hard to accept that it is just being driven by arcane psychological processes, such as cognitive dissonance, the sunk cost fallacy etc., although that is the explanation that most fits the evidence, IMO.</p>

        <p>I need to vent a bit</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I voice my opinions with my mother she does not judge me, I love my dad so much he has supported me for my whole life and truly does care for me but he has high blood pressure and was easy to anger even before covid I dont really know where he stands on it he does not share any of his own opinions but I know he does not understand it as I do from some things he has said earlier on to me in the pandemic like "You're doing everything that is recommended right" and b"just get in the habit of putting on the mask when you go into a store"</p>
<p>Now he works for Canada Post and hates the fact that his boss forces him to wear a mask when doing PO boxes when she is with him now cause he can't see in it. I have explained things to him like how the death counts are calculated and overinflated and he just said "I dont wanna hear it" and once He was talking about the flu cause it was on the news and I said so you know flu cases in Ontario and reporting are all down and they are all being reported as covid cases and he erupted "you can't compare this to any flu" and argued with me but then we made up and hugged and told each other we love each other so I love him but I wish he watched less news but I can't change him nor would it be right for me to try! </p>
<p>He has been like this long before covid he was obsessed with watching the news for the latest shooting funny the news does not really cover shootings anymore a year ago they were like 2 or 3 a week and that was the Canadian news covering US shootings...</p>

        <p>We need more of a presence on r/Coronavirus now that they're dooming about masks continuing after a vaccine.  The daily thread used to be dominated by skeptics, but now it's a whole bunch of dooming again.  Come on! Let them know that the virus isn't very deadly and this crazy talk of more lockdowns this winter is going to destroy so many lives!</p>

        <p>Am I the only one here who will be getting the vaccine when it's available to me?  I believe that we should be living our lives (and perhaps building up immunity) in the interim, but, if I'm not immune by then, I'm going to get the vaccine when I can and would encourage others to do so.  Herd immunity, one way or the other, is the only way we're getting this over with.  I think we should have left things wide open and been close to herd immunity by now, but we didn't.  I am really frustrated with anti-vaccine rhetoric coming from those who agree with me on lockdowns and social distancing.</p>

        <p>I’m in the last group to get the vaccine based on what my governor laid out.  I’m hoping by then we’ll have forgotten all about this virus, but I fully plan to skip it and I would take my chances with COVID.</p>

        <p>I’m only getting it if my employer requires it to return to the office. Although a few months ago (before any real vaccine news other than testing phases) our CEO said he doubts we’ll ever have a day where he requires everyone to work in the office again. He seems to want a “remote first” organization, so maybe it would be a hybrid plan, although he hasn’t followed up on it much and all I know is we are remote until next summer. </p>
<p>If work doesn’t require it, I will not be getting it.</p>

        <p>As things stand, I would likely be eligible for the vaccine in March. If I haven't been infected by then, I'll do it. But the likelihood of me dodging Rona until then is not very good.</p>
