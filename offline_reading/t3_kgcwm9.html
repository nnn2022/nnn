    <strong>I’ve given up.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m sorry, but there is no point anymore. Sorry for the ramble that’s about to follow.</p>
<p>We’ve been living like this, where I live, for nine months. Nine months of cruelty, and little freedom, because of a virus that people in their 90s were at risk of (of course, those same people were mostly denied visits in care homes and their health declined anyway). Various other areas of the world smashed car windows, broke into houses warrantless, and even beat up people for not wearing a mask in their car. Democracy in most areas is dead, all because of a virus that hardly kills healthy people under 70.</p>
<p>As a British resident, I was hoping that Christmas would finally be a time to relax, and enjoy, and have a little bit of fun, BUT NO! Like every single virus in history, COVID mutated, and now the governments look at those figures with glee in their eyes. Further reason to push our people further down! For Wales, a lockdown in a few hours, even though they just had a firebreak which did fuck all. For Scotland, all of mainland in the highest tier. For London, not even allowed to leave their own city, because of a singular mutation that is, apparently, easier to catch. They refuse to shut down schools, full of thousands of people, but suddenly relatives cannot be seen anymore. </p>
<p>And do you know what the worst thing is? This won’t be over soon, unless we collectively ignore these rules and push the government back. Small businesses are dying, gyms are closing, while Amazon continues to reap in heavy profits because of the restrictions forcing people in homes. And the vaccine may not only give you severe life-long effect, but will probably do nothing anyways, because masks and social distancing are here to stay.</p>
<p>Freedom has eroded. Friendships has died. My grades have completely dropped because none of my college teachers know how to effectively use the Internet to send in assignments. And all because of a virus where the average age of death is somewhere in the mid-80s. As for Wuhan? Celebrating in nightclubs, no masks, no social distancing, no anything. </p>
<p>So, I’ve gave up for good. I’ve been browsing through this subreddit for a few days, and I appreciate everybody trying to push back the narrative. But the police, with guns and batons and tasers, will always have the power to force people to wear a mask while walking through a park, or catching a bus. Fines are high, even some people have gone to jail. So what’s the point? If there’s another world, or another parallel dimension, I want to join that. I want to leave this planet. I’ve just lost confidence in everybody.</p></p>

        <p>Please don't give up. I can offer you something simple, actionable, and realistic that you can do, that we can all do to start pushing back against this. Freedom of association, assembly and speech are vital not just for people to organize against this but also to put the nonewnormal meme (not the silly internet idea, but the real Richard Dawkins concept of memes) out into the world to battle against the opposing ideas of lockdowns ans masks. Yet all of these freedoms have been restricted and there are only a few of us that are brave enough to be defiant. </p>
<p>So I think that without the ability to spread the nonewnormal meme, we are basically doomed to wait until people snap due to conditions imposed by the lockdowns that have become intolerable. This is a bad strategy because it invites much destruction and is far from guaranteed to work. What if there are so many people that never snap? What if the government becomes so draconian that even given the awful conditions they never reach the point where they decide they have nothing else to lose?</p>
<p>So that's why I came up with this: https://i.redd.it/jxnno9gzn6661.jpg</p>
<p>Have a look, and if you like the idea, start doing it yourself. In the mean time I will be working on popularizing the idea. I have many of my family and friends already convinced and starting to do this, but it is the strangers on the internet who have no built up trust in me which are proving a much harder nut to crack. I will continue to work on this until it happens though.</p>

<p>Where in the UK do you live? I don't see a single person obeying these rules because they can't: unlike many doomers, they have dependents. Tier 4 only exists on paper.</p>

        <p>but you have friends? other family? go create your own xmas-  I cut off my 'family' a very long time ago, created my own 'family' and it was the best decision ever.    Remember how thanksgiving turned into friendsgiving in america, possibly this will cause xmas to switch from running to every damn relatives house to just being with friends and your own family vs some weird strange long lost relative you see every 3 years.</p>
<p>I'm not even sorry but I will not schlep my kids all over the place on xmas or anywhere near xmas- cue major melt down.  <em>you</em> can cancel xmas- awesome but WE are doing what we always do.</p>
