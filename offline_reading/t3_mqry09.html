        <p>Not to mention all the other deaths they caused as a direct result of the lockdowns (suicides, drug overdoses, delayed treatment of other health issues). How many lives did they actually "save" vs how many did they actually harm? </p>
<p>Stay home, save lives... except  your own.</p>

        <p>This is such a good point and one that needs to be discussed more. Why wasn’t there any kind of focus on healthy habits during this whole thing? Oh because that wouldn’t be dooming.</p>

"(...)engaging in regular [physical activity] may be the single most important action individuals can take to prevent severe COVID-19 and its complications, including death. </p>
<p>"This message is especially important given the increased barriers to achieving regular [physical activity] during lockdowns and other pandemic restrictions."  </p>
<p>-----  </p>
<p>these are the last three sentences of the above linked text  </p>
<p>my oppinion is that restricting freedom of movement and freedom of assembly results in an attack on body autonomy as ... my body, my choice ... includes the ability to be able to go out whenever one is motivated to meet with whomever one feels happy to engage in a group sports activity ... while of course walking on ones own in the forest admiring natures beauty is a perfect choice to engage in a soft exercise not only for the mind, the feelings ( enjoying natures beauty ) but also smoothly allows body circulation ... some of us need or greatly profit from having the incentive of meeting with others to play ball games, run together ( without stupid masks ) or just plain rave a whole night trough loosing oneself in an orgasmic dance ecstasy surrounded by hundreds of sweaty smelly people all too enjoying each others clouds of bacteria and viruses emitted ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>there is not yet being given enough attention to how we can exchange our very own catalog of microbes living in our bodies and our skins, how we can exchange our very own collection of viruses we gathered trough our lifespans ... how the spontaneous meeting of people one to one or in groups of five, fifty or five hundred people </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how we greatly profit when being exhausted but happy, when we breath on each other full of pleasure, excited with the movements we enjoy together</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how this is positively enhancing our own biomes and viromes  </p>

<p>"A general rule of thumb for ecology is that higher diversity leads to a healthier ecosystem," says Gregory. "We know that more diversity of viruses and microbes is usually associated with a healthier individual. And we saw that healthier individuals tend to have a higher diversity of viruses, indicating that these viruses may be potentially doing something positive and having a beneficial role."</p>
