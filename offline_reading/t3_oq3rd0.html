    <strong>My opinion was never based on politics or the media in the first place</strong>
    <p><p>They have always claimed that we were brainwashed by misinformation, whether it comes from Fox News or Republican politicians (or Joe Rogan etc). They don‚Äôt understand that someone can reach their own conclusions based on their own common sense, which stems from projection* because they so readily accept what their preferred media and politicians/public figures tell them. Why else would they applaud celebs being publicly vaccinated? Read the comments on posts like those. They think there is some sort of hypocrisy in rejecting vaccines that Trump or Desantis endorse; that we will need to use crazy conspiracy theories to explain why it doesn‚Äôt matter that they and Fox changed their tune, as if we are all anti-vax due to their misinformation in the first place and are acting now simply as stubborn contrarians. I was never a Fox watcher, or a Facebook user, or someone blindly loyal to any particular politician or celebrity. I came to my own conclusions without those people and think/act according to my own beliefs, which seems to be incomprehensible to the vax-pushers.</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine pushers don't actually "own" their own thoughts and opinions. Everything they believe to be true about these vaccines and about covid has been planted inside their mind by the TV and MSM. </p>
<p>It is impossible to use logic and reason about a topic with someone who never used logic and reason for that topic in the first place. </p>
<p>They simply do not comprehend that a person could make their own conclusions based on critical and analytical thinking; in their head you HAVE to be appear on their TV to have an opinion that matters.</p>

        <p>That's because doomers are all about projection.</p>
<p>THEY hate Trump and will disagree with anything he says or does out of principle. (See: still wearing a mask so people don't mistake them for Trump voters). They cannot comprehend that for many of us, politicians have little to no bearing on our personal views. They worship politicians because they have no sense of self.</p>
<p>THEY feel unsafe, and are only taking precautions out of self-preservation. Therefore, they reason that if WE are not taking precautions, it's because WE want THEM to be unsafe. They then twist their selfish motivation by saying it they're doing it for other people. (See: maskers and vaxxers getting angry that they have to wear masks again. If it was so simple, they'd do it without complaint).</p>
<p>THEY have no real convictions outside of what the mainstream media and TikTok prescribe. They cannot fathom that we might have our own experiences, hesitancies, and reasons for not playing along with this charade. They think that if Trump came out and endorsed the vaccine (WHICH HE DID!) we'd all swallow our pride and get it. They cannot understand that our beliefs are outside the realm of what Trump or DeSantis or whoever they hate today says. </p>
<p>THEY have a pathological need for control and conformity. They DO NOT respect anyone who makes a different choice or believes a certain way. They say they're loving and accepting, but are the first to demand that anyone who voted for X or anyone who thinks Y needs to be removed from their lives. They cannot imagine a world where people can get along and prioritize relationships over political parties, because their whole existence is built upon strife, unhappiness. Literally every doomer I know is deeply dissatisfied with their life. When they see others who reject their narrative, this shakes their already fragile sense of self. That's why they demand you conform, because not doing so threatens them.</p>
<p>In sum, we are dealing with deeply, deeply disturbed individuals who have been masquerading as caring and informed citizens. This entire year has revealed their irrational fear, lust for self-preservation, and inability to consider any viewpoints or experiences besides their own. They literally cannot understand why a person would choose to ignore the hysteria and keep living their lives out of the spotlight of social media and woke points. In fact, I suspect it <em>enrages</em> them that we are somehow immune to this bullshit; I wonder if they envy us on some level.</p>

        <p>First of all, there's a typo in your post: "protection" instead of (what I assume is) "projection".</p>
<p>Also, I noticed this a long time ago and was really weirded out then too. Before this whole thing started and among children and adults alike, I would say something that was either a personal opinion or a belief based on things I observed for myself; or you know... just point out something I thought was common sense; and I would often be met with "who taught you that?", "where did you hear/read that?", etc. </p>
<p>Even as a child, it was baffling to me how so many people just couldn't conceive the idea of original thought, whatever you said <em>had</em> to have come from someone else. So I was not surprised at the amount of people blindly following MSM on recent events, because I also attributed it to heavy projection on their part then.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the heads up</p>
<p>And very good point about how this is such a common sentiment expressed to us even as children and how this way of thinking applies probably to much of their beliefs. Nobody needed to tell me that a brand new medical treatment could have unknown effects, that just seemed obvious.</p>
