    <strong>What have you learned about yourself throughout these lockdowns?</strong>
    <p><p>I'd like to hear about any self-realizations you've come to experience about yourself throughout these 9 months of flattening the curve.   </p>
<p>For me? </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I never knew I was an outdoorsy person. Yes, I love technology, build PC's / do animation, play videogames, ect - but being restricted to that makes me borderline suicidal. I really love being outside even if it's for no reason at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I now see who my true friends are and what they're made of. The amount that have bought into this and have effortlessly adapted to the netflix binge lifestyle is appalling. On the other hand, you can now see who is a healthy social person.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last and most important - Normality and sanity. My entire life growing up I was always paranoid. Endless childhood trauma, constant irrational fears, ect. It always seemed as though I was the one who was too afraid to enjoy life. I'd see people my age behave in reckless ways - "Why can't I have that confidence?", constantly questioning life and worry about what's to come next - "Why don't others feel the anxiety that I feel?". </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But now - HOLY SHIT. It's as though a flip switched and they're the crazy ones. It's like - are you serious? You're unfriending people who you see dining indoors on facebook? You really wear a mask in the car? You don't meet up with groups anymore but you're young and healthy? It cannot be said enough - some type of normality paradigm has shifted where now I feel untouchable surrounded by these constant fear mongering propaganda pieces yet these people who I used to be envious of for their confidence live life in fetal position.</p></p>

        <p>I learned that I’m not as much of an introvert as I thought I was. I never want to feel as isolated and alone as I did back in March and April, and I will fight tooth and nail to ever be there again mentally. </p>
<p>That I just...don’t give a shit? The news is nothing but a scare mongering tactic. Most of my “friends” are mindless drones who live for validation. Celebrities are irrelevant. Influencers are out of touch liars. And I don’t care about any of it. They can take their hashtags and their TikTok dances and their buzzfeed lists and kiss my ass. </p>
<p>Also, I’m conservative now.</p>

        <p>I learned that this is how I function best. Honestly, I am at my best being able to shut myself away from  the world. Knowing that people won't be getting in my personal space and stuff when out and about. </p>
<p>But I do understand it would be selfish of me if I was to expect the whole world to keep this up. Which is why I am against it all. But im still classed as selfish either way lol.</p>

        <p>I’ve realized how dumb people are and how they lack literally ANY ability to think critically. People are so eager to spread propaganda without even doing a shred of research.</p>
<p>People on the left love to claim how “educated” and “science adhering” they are, but they won’t even ask questions about whether the things going on make any sense i.e. LOCKDOWNS. </p>
<p>In summary, people are a lot dumber than I thought. I learned that I can actually think critically about something and make rational judgments</p>
<p>Edit: realized I kinda said my realizations about other people, but I’m leaving it up lol</p>

        <p>how much I like being able to go to the shops and choice of where to go, walk around freely. The choice of travelling.</p>
<p>Also I've realised how stupid the masses are and that there's always going to be a lower IQ segment of society that's very gullible and easy to control with propaganda. How much crap all the news is. I just read it for a laugh now, and sometimes to know what they will shut down next in this dystopian society.</p>
<p>I enjoy not wearing mask, breathing really loudly in shops and staring at people HAHAHA. A lot of them feel the same way they just daren't not wear a mask. At the start I didn't even think about this, now I just don't care. I also enjoy being rebellious and driving to different tIeR areas - call the police!!!1111</p>
<p>All that happens when you separate a country into tiers is that anyone with a brain will just travel into an other area to go to the hairdressers or whatever.</p>

<p>I have always been a rule follower. Never wanted to get in trouble. I realized the only rules I like are the ones that make sense. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m much more courageous than I ever thought. Walking into a building with no mask took a lot of courage for me. Again I’m a rule follower and don’t like attention. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don’t enjoy being alone as much as I thought. I am an introvert but I definitely need to be around people a few times a week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can’t stand those who don’t think for themselves. They just blindly follow any person in charge. Think for yourself!</p>

        <p>I have a higher tolerance for stress and even lower tolerance for bullshit than I thought I did. And the lingering thoughts about wishing I could be more typical for a woman my age are gone. I'd partly made peace with not fitting in as well as I'd like, and this got me the rest of the way there. If being part of the crowd means being paranoid and fearful about illness and putting full trust in the media and government, then let me be weird.</p>

        <p>I've always been a worrywart and have a tendency to concern over relatively meaningless things. But, it makes sense why I do that. I was brought up in a fear based society. Marketing is fear based. Kids now are going to have even bigger anxiety issues than I do because of this.</p>
<p>Also, North Korea, are you watching? Have you seen how easy it is to control a society all in the name of $afety??</p>

<li>That my hearing is in a limbo. My doctor says I hears perfectly fine, but I don't understand most of the things most people are saying nowadays because of masks. So, although I've perfect hearing - my preferred communication method is writing and gesturing. I do know a little bit sign language too.</li>
<li>That I've never taken for granted how my country used to be and always seen it as great, but I didn't expect it to change overnight over a virus with 99,97% survival rate. Now I'm more skeptical to politicians, people I knows and so on that I used to be.</li>
<li>How disturbing it's not being able to see people's faces and having to social distance. In periods I've forgotten talking my native language perfectly. I mess up grammars, forgets a few words and a few phrases. My spoken language skills returns when I've had normal conversations, but fades when I don't. My writing skills in both my first language and English have stayed the same.</li>
<li>What it feels like to feel like a foreigner in my own country and not having a belonging. I also knows how it feels like to love people around me, but feel like we don't really share the same culture and values. Sometimes it feels like we're from different nationalities although we're not. Hard to explain!</li>
