        <p>All their points are weak af. I mean, you can literally write both sides of the conversation and this is the best you can come up with?</p>
<p>&rt; "The vaccines arrived so fast. How do we know they're safe?"</p>
<p>&rt; COVID-19 vaccines went through the same safety checks as other vaccines. Rather than the science being sped up, the administrative and funding processes have been fast-tracked.</p>
<p>Yeah, even time itself has been fast tracked. They put people in trials inside hyperbolic time chambers and that's how we know the vaccine creates no long term issues. Jesus. There's a reason why vaccines take decades to develop, and it's not because it's hard to come up with one that works.</p>
<p>&rt; "Most people don't even get that sick, so why do we need a vaccine?"</p>
<p>&rt; Getting vaccinated protects you against the serious side effects of COVID-19 and means you are less likely to pass it on to others. Vaccination isn't just about protecting ourselves.</p>
<p>LESS LIKELY lol. But if the vaccine protects agains serious side effects, it means that the other person I'm infecting (if vaccinated) won't have any. So why would I inject myself with this garbage then? </p>
<p>&rt; "I'm worried about the side effects…"</p>
<p>&rt; It's normal to experience mild side effects, but severe reactions to vaccines are very rare. Health experts are closely monitoring this, and so far, research shows COVID vaccines are safe.</p>
<p>Oh well if health experts are closely monitoring this we're kewl. And SO FAR research shows vaccines are safe. VAERS begs to say otherwise (oh and btw they've pulled the swine flu vaccines over something like 25 deaths in the US. We're at 6000+.)</p>
<p>Jesus christ I hate this clown world. Who's buying this garbage?</p>

        <p>Who buys this garbage?</p>
<p>At one point, the ABC was non-biased in their reporting. Well less biased. When the LNP won the unwinable election, the defunding of our national broadcaster was accelerated and Murdoch stooges appointed to their management.</p>
<p>Now we are here.</p>
<p>IMO we have 2 viruses that are much more concerning than the old corona.</p>
<p>Capitalism and the media.</p>
<p>Without either, this shitshow wouldn't have gained any traction.</p>

        <p>The idea of how to communicate with such people is sound. But it would be nice if they talked about actual, science-backed arguments instead of the “don’t worry about the side effects” BS.</p>
