<title>You know what's crazy? Is that people would rather believe a gene therapy that has only had months of testing for a low mortality virus over their bodies own immunity/natural herd immunity. You and anyone else has mental health issues if you can't even trust your body.</title>

        <p>The very first red flag I had about this covid vaccine was the fact that it took them less time to make a goddamn vaccine than it does for apple to make a new iphone. And we all know Apple always releases their crap junk products too fast without even testing them out first. Apple basically uses their entire customer base as beta testers just like the world is using human subjects as beta testers for the vaccine.</p>
<p>If I don't even trust Apple to make a good phone in a year's amount of time, how the hell do you expect me to trust a damn pharmaceutical company whose technology is a lot more advanced than for a phone? </p>
<p>And another thing, Pfizer makes erection pills. It's called viagra. Why are they making vaccines now? Did they not get enough money from their erection pills? </p>
<p>You want to know what Johnson and Johnson does? They make fucking baby powder and shower products.  And now they're doing vaccines? </p>
<p>During the entire pandemic, I have never gotten sick a single time. That one day that I was having caffeine withdrawals doesn't count.</p>

        <p>I have been traveling on planes all through the pandemic and going to huge Vegas parties. I was around friends who had Covid. I never got it. Never had vaccine either. Seems like only smokers tend to get this thing.</p>
