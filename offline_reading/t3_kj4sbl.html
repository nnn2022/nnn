    <strong>So why can't we hug again?</strong>
    <p><p>Been having a lot of discussion on the matter of hugging with family and friends lately. A lot of folks are refusing to hug each no matter the occasion. Being it a birthday, Christmas, a sad moment or even funerals.</p>
<p>When I ask why they don't. I simple hear "we're not supposed to because of covid-19". I personally could care less and still hug anyone willing to do so. Which is definitely my family (including grandma) and any friends that still accept it. Same goes for handshakes.</p>
<p>So what's the theory about how supposedly dangerous hugging is anyway? If it's linked to keeping the 2 feet apart. Then that's a total sham, cause nobody does that either. So why couldn't you just hug it out then?</p></p>

        <p>I went to a Xmas/football party just last weekend. Small group. Two of them were claiming symptoms but negative tests. One of them was on quarantine even after a negative test. Nobody gave a single fuck. Everybody hugged. And I'm still alive.</p>

        <p>I haven’t stopped hugging people at all. One of my friends is pregnant and so I don’t hug her currently just to be respectful but if she initiated it, I certainly would hug back! We hugged all year before she got pregnant. Everyone else, I hug no issue.</p>

        <p>I'm a hairstylist and used to hug the majority of my clients. At this point I have a good percentage of clients who will happily hug [all with a "can we hug" question first which was never a thing pre covid]. However, it completely cracks me up that doomers who are terrified are completely fine with me being extremely close to them, giving them a shampoo, scalp massage, haircut/color, spending hours next to them and at the end of it find the idea of a hug as completely reckless. Like I was just touching your hair/neck/face for hours but a hug is insane? Madness.</p>

        <p>Wow, so in the monster movies when the mummy or zombie comes at you with it's arm raised and in front like it's going to hug you, that's actually what it was going to do? No wonder it was scary. Who knows what kind of mutated covid a mummy or zombie has?</p>
<p>Since Hollywood is out of ideas and recycles old ones I think I just announced the next blockbuster :</p>
<p>Frankenstein and the Werewolf against The Mummy, Dracula and Covid.</p>
