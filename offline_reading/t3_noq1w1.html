    <strong>Being asked to put a mask on</strong>
    <p><p>I went into a restaurant without a mask on(state lifted mask restrictions) was asked to put one on. For the sake of not causing a scene I did, but it ruined the experience of the restaurant for me I ended up not eating there and leaving. The stupidity  of the thought that I’m a threat 20 ft away from my table but once I sit down I’m magically covid free?
 Does anyone else feel as if life experiences get utterly destroyed because of the mask</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, honestly the only way to solve the problem is to turn around and walk out the door.</p>
<p>Sure the person up front is just an employee, but if the manager or preferably the owner see that enough times they'll change their tune.</p>

        <p>Just stop!</p>
<p>When asked to mask up. Refuse. </p>
<p>I went to a waffle house today. It was so busy they had a waiting list. The host called out a name. Came over to us and ask if we were that person. I couldn't understand the host with her mask on and I said "huh?" Then a waitress behind the counter said " she told you to put a mask on." I then proceeded to point out  everyone everyone around us without a mask including some of her coworkers. Then her boss told her " no she didn't tell them to put a mask on, she was calling out a name". I didn't give in to the misunderstanding. I stood my ground as we all should. </p>
<p>Stop giving people authority over you. Stand up for yourself, you are a free individual.</p>

        <p>I can attest to this phenomenon. I consistently go maskless now with head high. In church yesterday, another lady was maskless, but her friend told her she needed a mask and had her husband get it. She put it on but after a minute made it a chin strap when she saw:</p>
<p>1) This lady never asked me to wear one.
2) I made a sad frown when she accepted the mask to wear.</p>
<p>She ripped that thing off so fast and smiled at me, I nodded back.</p>
<p>We are the example, head high with a smile!</p>

        <p>I do agree with you. This is good advice. However in this situation the person of authority over the waitress stepped in and corrected her. Her boss was quite snarky with her as well. I was surprised that I was defended, but it was very nice to see.</p>

        <p>Ok well for one I'm pretty sure all kinds of masks serve a purpose rather they are for hiding your face, keeping harmful fumes from being inhaled, to protect against injuries in sports, protecting you from the elements, or even invisable germs that you probably don't believe in. Secondly I'm not for masks themselves but for everyone following the rules, requests, and requirements set around them. I don't feel like my personal freedom should impose on others negatively. If your place of business asks me to put on a mask and I choose to go into your business I should put on a mask. Same with no shoes, no shirt, no service. Or them asking you not to bring in a gun. My objection to his comment wasn't he should have to be forced to wear mask everywhere he goes, it was his take on his personal freedoms out playing the restricted guidelines placed on everyone, and his rejection of anyone being able to have authority over him. If no one has authority over him why would he follow any kind of restrictions? Restrictions such as those I mentioned previously age of consent and speed limits . . . They are both just restrictions nothing other than other people are keeping you from doing them. And as he stated clearly he rejects any other authority over his own personal freedoms. So what right do you have to deny him that?</p>

        <p>The "authority" in the US has crossed the line. Our government ment to be run by the people for the people is no longer. I refuse to give my consent to people that have sold out me, and my fellow americans, and continue to lie straight to our face. As for businesses they have the right not to serve me, and I have walked out of plenty of them in the last year. Its obvious you skipped the part of my comment where I mentioned there was a misunderstanding. We all deserve better than this. Doesn't matter who your are or what your opinions might be.</p>

        <p>I agree Authority in the United States has crossed several lines and there is a right or wrong way to go about it and my only objection originally was individual freedoms to evade responsibilities. Although I do enjoy freedom, it's not freedom from consequence. If I choose to go against the authority rather it's something minor as being asked to leave, pay a fine, or face jail time, that's on me.</p>
<p>Like the T-Rex guy, he exercised right to make an ass of himself using free speech accusing others in a negative way with no backing whatsoever to belittle an argument about personal responsibility Authority and personal freedoms. Or individual freedoms if you'd rather.</p>
<p>I live in the world of black and white with very little gray, rules and laws are equivalent and everyone around should follow them, even the ones I don't like or I think are stupid. The ones I don't like, care for, or are stupid, I vote against or I move to a place where they no longer apply to me. </p>
<p>In the end as far as masks are concerned we both agree you don't have to go there and they don't have to serve you.</p>
<p>It's just not many people realize that if you go there and you refused to leave its criminal trespassing. So depending on the state that Authority could land you in jail for a crime you committed willingly. To many see it as it's their right to be there and we have to serve them. Kind of like if you ask someone to leave your house and they don't you have the right and the authority to remove them or call 911 and have the cops do it for you. Again depending on the state some states say if someone trespasses into your house you are the one that has to legally leave. . .</p>

        <p>"If a law is unjust, a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so."
Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>You can experience the world anyway you'd like. I choose freedom over safety, because safety is an illusion. People that offer safety want to be paid a much larger price than I'm willing to pay. I will gladly stand up for the freedoms of myself and the others around me, but I will not make a sacrifice to another man for their protection. We have seen where this leads, and it leads to enslavement. 
Common law makes the most sense to me. If there is no victim there is no crime. Authority has surpassed keeping the peace and has gone right into making profit from unnecessary regulations and fines. If we are all created equal then no man has power over another. To blindly follow laws just because someone says you have to is foolish, and will lead you down a dark path. We know what the US was built on, and we have strayed far from it. To go back to your first post I would suggest not making baseless assumption of (" your the type of person to"), to the people that are the only ones left standing for your freedom. If I were to make an assumption based on your comments I would assume that you would allow nazi germany to rise to power, gather up all of your neighbors, and try to dominate the world, because germany passed a few laws which you would gladly follow. Simply because you are told to. However this would be this would foolish, and I would assume that even in your black and white world view there are other factors that you would look at before allowing that to happen, but I could be wrong. I don't know you. But I do know one thing. I dont have to personal to want you to be a free individual on this earth.</p>

        <p>My absolute favorite burger place still mandates masks and actually enforces it. This is in Oklahoma, mind you, where probably 90% of all businesses, even in the cities, don't care anymore. I even got a gift card to this place recently. I'm not going back until they cut it out.</p>

        <p>Yeah, early in all of this I refused to go to a restaurant to eat if they wore masks or we had to, even on my birthday where the meal was free. Thats how strong I feel about it.</p>
<p>Why would I want to eat at a place that looks like a hospital or biolab. I don't understand why others do.. Really in my life restaurants are at the bottom of my list of MUST do things.</p>

        <p>You're not alone.</p>
<p>I hate masks and people who demand that others wear them. </p>
<p>On one hand you have authoritarians who stand to gain wealth &amp; power from what's happening... That much I understand.</p>
<p>But on the other -- we have people who are so mentally inept that they can't see through the propaganda, lies, and absurdity of all this. Seriously, I wonder what the IQ is for someone like this. 95? 80? Just how dumb are these people, really?</p>
<p>Mask on, to the table. Mask off, at the table. Makes so much sense. /s</p>
<p>On a serious note -- this never would have worked if they hadn't politicized this. I was never a Trump supporter but it is the blind rage against him that makes people support the rest of this nonsense.</p>
<p>Would they have worn masks as ordered by Trump? Would they have taken a vaccine that came out under his administration?</p>
<p>What would they do if Trump was using coercive policies to force them to take it? Can you imagine?</p>

        <p>Whenever someone asks me, I just really confidently say “I have an exemption.” I actually <em>do</em> have one for mental health reasons but often being confident and assertive prevents people asking me to see it. Like literally only one person ever asked to see it (totally not a violation of privacy) and it was a librarian. I gave in out of fear but there’s always other libraries haha.</p>

        <p>This is the thing that gets me, you show up to a place that requires a mask, and you try to enter it even seeing posted signs requiring masks and play the victim and get all butt hurt because you shouldn't need a mask . . .But bro no one is making you go there. It's not that following simple requirements even though they are inconvenient makes you a sheep. It's demanding that they don't apply to you and you shouldn't have to follow them to get the same treatment makes you an ass. If I as a store owner say only people with red shoes are allowed in I have that right no matter how stupid of rule that would be, you would still be the ass in blue shoes demanding I let you in vs just going across the street to eat.</p>

        <p>That would all be well and good except the Supreme Court ruled that businesses can't discriminate whom they serve when they ruled that a bakery acted illegally for not making a wedding cake for a pair of pillow biters, despite the fact the owner of the bakery thought that pillow biter marriage was a sham and ungodly. </p>
<p>I actually disagree with the Supreme Court here and I agree with the bakers because sometimes freedom is ugly. You should be able to serve who you want. I'm all good with businesses denying service based on customers not complying to requests by the business and I would happily leave if my maskless face were an issue. That's what freedom is. They have the right to not serve me and I have the right to leave. I'm good with it.</p>
<p>With that precedent set, we can get some real discrimination going again, bringing back segregation with a vengeance. Soon maybe restaurant owners, noticing a trend amongst their customers, start refusing service or making black people pay before eating because they are "far more likely" to use the Dine N Dash payment plan. You good with that too? You must be from what I'm reading. Yes sir, me too. Let's get this thing segregated out again and show people what real freedom looks like.</p>
