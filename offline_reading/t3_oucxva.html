    <strong>Daily reminder that no one can tell me how Covid started. Yet somehow potential variants are totally on me.</strong>
    <p><p>If preventing another pandemic is the #1 goal right now, why can no one tell me how Covid started and why has nothing been to done to address how it started? Wet market? Ok. There are still wet markets all over the world selling exotic animals. We can forcefully inject the world with drugs, but we can't put some food standards on Chinese markets? Lab leak? We are still doing gain of function research all over the world, and the Wuhan lab still hasn't been audited.</p>
<p>So why on earth am I expected to put myself in harms way to prevent a variant, when nothing has been done to address the root cause of the pandemic? I can inject myself with every vaccine known to man, but as long as China is still manufacturing viruses and people are eating bat soup, we could have a new pandemic start tomorrow.</p></p>

        <p>It absolutely was not a wet market. Literally impossible. MERS started in the wild and they tracked down every step the virus made right down to it's source in 8 months. SARS was also zoonotic and it was tracked down in 6 months. </p>
<p>SARS2 - absolutely nothing! Not a single step has been found. They can't even fake it. </p>
<p>This was made in the lab using US. dollars. They took SARS1 and juiced it up. They added the S1/S2 protein and an insertion of a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein, snippets of HIV and Malaria. </p>
<p>We know how it started, they just don't want to say it. It will kill them for Trump to be correct.</p>

        <p>And Fauci, who funded the gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is still being treated as someone worth listening to. If that imbecile is still The Expert we're supposed to be following, we're fucked.</p>

        <p>It came from a lab in Wuhan where they were studying coronaviruses and editing them to be more transmissible to humans. Huge coincidence. </p>
<p>Or they released on purpose for a huge power grab.</p>

        <p>My belief is that it was released during a sort of international military olympics in Fall 2019. Many of the participants and coaches fell ill, and took it back to their home countries.</p>
<p>And that event was held in a little place we call ...</p>
<p>WUHAN, China.</p>
<p>What would be more diabolical than to release a virus to infect all the fittest of the military at once? </p>
<p>Maybe it was an accident, maybe it was a trial run. I don't know. </p>
<p>I blame China for the leak, but I blame my own country for funding and creating the virus. I concluded that after listening to David E Martin's patent evidence.</p>

        <p>I talked to this Chinese dude on a gay chat room and we ended up becoming internet friends. I told him I'm a conspiracy theorist and I told him my theories and then I asked what his theory was as to the origin. He says he thinks it started in the wet markets and he doesn't think it was released from a lab.</p>

        <p>You do know that China is insane when it comes to monitoring peoples internet usage. Even if he wanted to agree it came from a lab he's not going to risk his life like that.</p>
