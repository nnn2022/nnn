    <strong>The "pandemic" has separated the men from the boys.</strong>
    <p><p>The hysterical demography who praise lockdowns to 'save lives' is the same people who promote obesity and HAES nonsense.</p>
<p>I have this theory that people who go along with the narrative have had an easy life so far (that would explain why really smart people still get caught up into this). </p>
<p>Though I work a white-collar job, I grew up in a rather poor/working class family and every single person, without exception, in my family is against the lockdowns and measures.</p>
<p>Something needs to be said about lack of things making men.. <em>men</em> nowadays.</p>
<p>Back then, they worked twelve-hour days, six days a week in factories/sweatshops. They knew what struggle was.</p>
<p>I know some people working in the trades, and it's pretty much unanimous. They think masking is stupid and despise the governmental overreach.</p>
<p>This needs to be repeated: <em>“Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, and weak men create hard times.”</em></p></p>

<p>Yep.</p>
<p>But seriously though, yeah. It seems the entire world now is dictated to by the mentally ill. The more mentally unstable you are, the more significant society deems your opinion.</p>
<p>Absolutely, people have literally become like children.</p>

        <p>Definitely. It’s separating men from boys, followers from leader, and hypocrites from the rest. It’s sad and scary. Feeling concerned I will never find like minded folks or feel secure in a community because sane people are SO HARD to come by. I want to say I’m unvaxxed to weed out the weak ones and save time but genuinely concerned for my safety in the near future in this state if I do, so I keep it close to the vest... thus making it harder to find same.</p>

        <p>I chat to everyone about it all. I'm sure most of them think I'm nuts but at the same point I'm fairly well-read on the whole SDG framework so its easy to predict what comes next. In theory if you can tell people whats happening and then it happens, they might start to question things. Or not. I don't really give a shit what people think anymore.</p>

        <p>Well said. Also, for what it’s worth, the women who aren’t buying the lockdown/vaccine hysteria seem to be the the more physically attractive ones more often than not. I’m sure that’s just a coincidence</p>

        <p>Didn’t they do a study once that found conservative-leaning women were seen as more attractive? I hate how that term is now synonymous with very far right though. I would say the men are seen in a similar way but who knows.</p>

        <p>In my experience its been the opposite. Whenever I see a couple, its almost always the woman wearing a mask. Very, very rarely is it the man wearing a mask and the woman isn't. I think it's due to women naturally following the crowd.</p>

        <p>I think men are just (generally) less-likely than women to feel they need to take precautions. It’s sort of like the old thing about men refusing to ask for directions, read the instruction manuals, etc. Women just are more “by the book” it seems, regardless of whether or not “the book” makes sense</p>

        <p>In a strange way, being able to differentiate between these two types makes some things easier. Like finding companionship, friends, etc. The important things. I sure as hell know I won't be associating with the sheep. I've lost a LOT of friends these past 16 months because they revealed their true nature. It sucks, but my life will be better for it.</p>

        <p>Started watching TV shows from the 70s recently and it's actually kind of disturbing in a way how behaviours changed in 40 years. At one level I think it's cool to watch something that reflects how I think. On the other hand it's depressing to think that I identify with a culture that was dead before I was born.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking this the whole time. If I say it here, I get downvoted into oblivion. If I say it in person, beta types immediately call me toxic. (To be fair, without meeting me I do appear to be a stereotypical <em>man.</em>)</p>
<p>This is a massive issue that plenty of women have also brought to my attention.</p>
<p>Men are far and few these days. Most humans with dicks are now docile cattle who barely even have bass in their voices. This is paired with genetics, and the way our food is poisoned. However, the attitude, the spirit, belongs to the individual.</p>

        <p>As a woman I have noticed this...my taste in men has completely  changed from a year ago. I now notice how all the types of guys around me in NYC that I used to date (I know, my fault for moving here) are seriously lacking in courage to stand up to all this.

        <p>Ok, heres things we’re all agreeing on-</p>
<p>In general the working class has had to maintain working the whole time, and in general values the strength that comes with securing our own survival, and thus are suspicious of the government mandating safety percautions supposedy for public heath.</p>
<p>In genral we have disdain for the richer people who can afford not to work, and also pay us to deliver their food to their doors, and who even now are choosing instead to stay jobless and take goverment money instead of look for work.</p>
<p>We understand that both this class of people and the current government leech more of us than do they benefit us.</p>
<p>We’re probably all armed, better trained in fighting, spend more time outside and are in general healthier...</p>
<p>Im NOT saying we should overthrow the government , or launch any kind of violent attacks... because we dont fucking need to. If we’re the ones who till the fields, mill the grain, bake the bread, kill the animals later eaten, cut down the trees, build the houses, boats, and cars, make and deliver all the useless shit the rich buy on Amazon, guard our buildings at night, and put out the fucking fires... </p>
<p>If we’re not only the white working class, but, despite what the news would have you believe, also a large part of the black and latino population...</p>
<p>If even if were not the entire military theres not a chance they could be convinced to attack us en masse, if we just say, refused to acknowledge these restriction laws, refused to have the benefits of our labor reaped by the rich, and maybe... got individual communities to divest from large corporations, and develop our own currencies, something Pittsfield MA did successfully in the wake of the recession...</p>
<p>Who has the power here?</p>

        <p>HAES is literally about making people of every size engage in healthy behaviours like exercising and eating vegetables. It's about the furthest thing from this lockdown/forced vaccination shit. Instead of hating people who are unhealthy like anti-HAES people do and lockdown/masking proponents also do and mocking them the correct response is and always has been to encourage healthy behaviours like going outside, eating vegetables, seeing friends, and generally living a normal and active life. Period.</p>

        <p>Back in the day there was no smart phones, news was just local. 
Now days we are constantly feed all the problems of the world and how we should take responsibility for these. 
It's to much for men to handle, we are men we care about all people and want strong society. 
In the end we hide in a video game or online complaining. 
Most men I think have just pick safety for themself these days.</p>
