<p>Fear a virus they openly admit isn't deadly to pretty much everyone...</p>
<p>Or...</p>
<p>Fear totalitarianism.</p>
<p>If you weren't asleep in history class, you'd know the obvious answer here. </p>
<p>But you were asleep, weren't you?</p>
<p>Yes. I agree. I do fear totalitarianism. Because it's actually real, it's actually happened, and you can still see affects today. </p>
<p>I give you credit for trying a different angle, but most of us are here because <em>we've done that already</em> and whole thing being theater is literally the <em>only</em> logical conclusion</p>

        <p>Yes, we're frightened. That's why we view other people as walking plague rats, that's why we mask, that's why we hide behind face shields, that's why we cringe when a stranger walks by at the store, that's why we want to stay home forever, and fear is also why we are in favor of collapsing the economy and destroying small businesses. </p>

        <p>I will openly admit that I am, in fact afraid. I am afraid to take a new medicine that skipped years of testing just to attempt to prevent an illness that, statistically, I will survive if I do catch it. I am afraid of what may be growing in the warm, moist environment that is my mask. I am afraid that too many people in the world don't use their brains to think critically about governments and companies that have shown time and time again that they can not be trusted. But those are my fears to live with, what are yours?</p>

        <p>Just because you caught it and it was scary doesn’t mean that I have to be scared of it. I’m more scared of what an untested medication may do to me long term than I am of getting sick. </p>
<p>No, I am not afraid of putting on a new mask. But when I am breathing into something my warm, moist breath creates a warm, moist environment inside of the mask. Just. Like everyone else on the planet. I’m sorry if I wasn’t clear about that before. </p>
<p>I’m not denying that covid is a real thing. I’m skeptical that it is as seriously it has been made out to be, because I have looked at the facts that are available to everyone. Also, I don’t trust the pharmaceutical companies nor the government, nor should anyone.</p>

        <p>Why wait, you can read the reports of people who have been vaccinated catching covid right now. Also, I didn't say anything about microchips. If you can't have a civil discussion without attempting to ridicule why would I continue to do the same. I did say that I am concerned about a medication that hasn't been properly tested yet. I very well may change my opinion on it after a few years, I may not. </p>
<p>I brought up the warm, moist environment because that is the exact conditions that all sorts of living organisms love to grow in, none of which would you want to inhale, which is exactly what you are doing when you are wearing a mask.

        <p>Huh. What about the cloth masks I have here? Do they have pollutants and “harmful chemicals” </p>
<p>Lol maybe if you eat the mask you’ll take in those harmful chemicals “found within”. But I think putting it over your lower half of the face to contain the particles isn’t gonna make you ingest the “micro plastics” lol</p>

        <p>I meant the plastics said to have been found in masks, not the lead you mention, stating tuna as an example of micro plastics which are ingested. I understand that those are harmful because they’re ingested.</p>
<p>I don’t see how a “moist environment” can cause supposed plastics and “chemicals”found within masks to harm you, especially when they’re changed how often</p>

        <p>I don't know about everyone else here, but just holding these views takes an amount of bravery, study, and self-reflection. You think its easy having to deal with constant ridicule? Probably not, most other parts of this site shelter you from counter-arguments and censor the shit out of dissenting opinion allowing you to stay in a warm bubble of feeling virtuous by strapping something to your face and going along with the flow. It's made me go back to the research time and again, looking for studies, counter-studies, especially focused on working against cognitive bias, in the end to once again be re-assured I'm not the crazy one. </p>
<p>I think its easy to make a mockery of some of the political aspects, but just making light of it means that you aren't recognizing the nature of how slippery of a slope personal freedoms can be, and frankly comes across as a bit naive.</p>

        <p>Ok, that’s the fairest point I’ve heard.</p>
<p>It’s personal freedom to whether you want to wear the masks, and government shouldn’t try to interfere with personal choice. Makes sense, I don’t agree because we should have patience and help stop the virus, but makes sense to be frustrated about that.</p>
<p>But slippery slope meaning what? </p>
<p>First masks and a vaccine, then concentration camps? Or first masks, then a), then b), then c), then maybe d), AND THEN concentration camps? </p>
<p>I don’t understand what’s the slippery slope here. </p>
<p>We’re living in some of the most free lands on earth. Government asks we wear masks, lockdown for a little bit and get a vaccine to help stop a virus that’s been spreading and really messing up people in other parts of the world, now all of a sudden we’re heading to into something dictatorship-like?</p>

        <p>Have a read on inverse-totalitarianism - but just to discuss, I think its a bit more nuanced - and I think its bigger than masks. We are heading to a point in society, where private business is gaining more and more control over our personal freedoms (watch some black mirror). Every time you click you "agree to the terms" you are often giving up privacy/freedoms for the sake of using some platform. They say, no we aren't violating your freedoms, we are choosing to allow or disallow content on our platform, but when those platforms become the "town-square" it very quickly becomes freedom limiting. Gone are the days where entire towns meet together to discuss issues of the day - and perhaps we need to return to this... when you invite a powerful entity to have some control over your life, you give them a mandate to further regulate it.  </p>
<p>Essentially and frankly the point about the slippery slope of freedoms boils down to creating classes of people, and treating them entirely differently, in order to further encourage the masses to do the freedom limiting on your behalf. Mask mandates lead to more mask mandates, for every new scare that comes our way, lockdowns lead to more lockdowns... eventually, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but once we've come accustomed to these things, they become expected and "normal," hence the name of this sub, but ultimately twisted and used for alternative purposes ... before you know it, expect to see new mask mandates for every new little antigen that floats our way. We've already absolutely obliterated the livelihoods of millions of people for a virus that hasn't demonstrated the level danger of such a strong reaction - meanwhile the corporations with huge ins with the government continue to fill the space left behind by the devastation of wrecking small mom and pops. Eventually, there will only be big chains, and when you run out of options except for "go live off the land if you don't like it" then you've basically created a society that outcasts anyone that doesn't follow the expectations, a cruel punishment. </p>
<p>Look at this talk of vaccine passports, the idea that you will need to wear a symbol for everyone to see if you aren't vaccinated is the equivalent of trying to put a dunce hat on those that have very real concerns over the safety and efficacy of something the government is pushing on its people. I mean demonstrably we can see this thing in action: first its, two weeks to flatten the curve, mask mandates, limiting what businesses can and can't operate, forbidding 1st amendment rights of freedom to assemble (again in the name of a virus that is mostly harmless to our youngest and working generations), now its "do you have your travel papers?" -- whats next? "No you don't have to take the vaccine, but forever-more you will need to walk around in society different than everyone else" -- hardly freedom. You will need the vaccine to travel, work, operate a business, and if not? You are no longer a welcome participant of society. Again, this all started with preventing hospitals from being overrun, none of the protections were meant to do anything but "SLOW THE SPREAD" and now its "prevent the spread" --- do you see how small semantic changes have completely turned this entire event on its head? now we have people coming in here calling us murderers because we don't want to be forced to do something against our conscience. If you can't see how this can continue to be extrapolated until its "take this new booster shot to continue to participate in society" you aren't likely zooming out to see the larger picture here...</p>

        <p>An interesting perspective, thank you</p>
<p>It does come across as quite cynical, as if implying that there is some force or group of people who wish to establish such a system, where as you mention “new booster shots to participate in society” are prevalent and other forms of “control”</p>
<p>I believe if you think without theories or cynicism, the narrative that actually happened does make sense and is realistic.</p>
<p>We haven’t dealt with (in our modern world of internet, social media, widespread perspectives and paranoia) a situation like the one covid has brought. </p>
<p>First, the virus emerges on some news and social media, posts about something apparently going on in China and stories of people being shut in their homes, forced to stay indoors.</p>
<p>Then Italy happens, causing worry and precautions to begin throughout the west. Masks, lockdowns like Italy had placed and social distancing were enacted.</p>
<p>Now to better understand things, let’s think from the perspective of those with power to place such mandates into effect, our politicians. Remember, they’re humans and see such posts as we do, they are unclear on what’s exactly going on. What they see is sickness spreading in Europe, reports of hospitals over-flooded and many deaths, especially among seniors. </p>
<p>So as they research to better understand they realize, “Oh, it’s an airborne sickness. So in theory, if everyone wore masks, the airborne virus particles will be much better contained, decreasing the spread”</p>
<p>As well as noting in experiments that the virus particles get weaker as they travel, and at around 6 feet they are much less effective. It makes sense now to tell people keep some space. </p>
<p>They also notice “Hey, in large groups of people, any virus is far more likely to spread, maybe if we can reduce meetups for a little while, people can just connect over the internet instead so this whole thing ends sooner.”</p>
<p>In their perspective, they need to do the best they can to get things back to normal, while also likely being afraid to make the wrong move and receive blame for rises in deaths/cases.</p>
<p>That would be a non-cynical, realistic understanding and narrative of the situation. If you think of it cynically and with too much skepticism, there’s likely a hundred different ulterior motives you could suggest have been organized and synchronized between the world’s many different elected governments to enact a type of slavery and “new normal”</p>
<p>Also I believe towns and cities still have councils and elected mayors? Not to mention conferences and boards? My city has people you can meet with at councils and speak to regarding local issues. So no, those days haven’t been snatched away from us quite yet. </p>
<p>Side note - isn’t wearing masks in cases of widespread airborne viruses only logical? If someone who happens to be sick happens to have a mask and keeps a distance from others, wouldn’t those virus particles be better contained and less likely to spread?</p>

        <p>Also, I don’t understand what you mention about giving up privacy/freedoms by clicking “agree to the terms”.</p>
<p>I haven’t noticed any decrease in my privacy or my freedom ever since the first time I pressed “agree to terms” (when I made a Facebook account about 10 years ago) and I haven’t felt that any of my freedoms were violated in all the times I’ve agreed to terms since then. </p>
<p>So.... Where is the oppression? </p>
<p>Is it because they don’t want people posting conspiracy theories, which seems to be due to fear in light of the increase in mass-shootings and psychotic people - who in a lot of cases seem be wrapped up in conspiracy theories, whether it be racial, political, or anything really.</p>
<p>A lot of times people are “treated differently”, because they say some stupid, insensitive or confusing shit. That’s probably a big reason for why they’re being banned from certain social media sites. </p>
<p>Let’s say 5 years from now, I doubt you’ll be discriminated or treated differently, just for not getting the vaccine. I doubt anyone will care to even ask at that point.</p>

<p>&rt; I haven’t felt that any of my freedoms were violated in all the times I’ve agreed to terms since then.</p>
<p>Duh. You aren't supposed to <strong>feel</strong> it or <strong>notice</strong> it... its basically like inception... look this whole area used to be my fucking day job and I've moved away from the field in disgust - read up on nudge theory, behavioral economics/psychology. The whole idea is that you are just supposed to mindlessly use the service and then they use your data to <strong>manipulate</strong> your opinions, thoughts, beliefs and actions - research cambridge analytica. I've sat in meetings where we review the latest research on how to compel a certain type of thinking based on the big 5 personality traits of users and its honestly grotesque thinking back on it. </p>
<p>Also, just fyi - often law enforcement has the ability to just get access to so much of this data - the whole "if you haven't done anything wrong then what are you afraid of" concept by the way is the same argument used for hundreds of years: if you don't have anything to hide, then why can't the army come search your house? I suggest you do some research on right to privacy and why its so important - I really honestly don't feel like i need to defend the 4th amendment --- the only thing the bill of rights didn't expect was that the industrial complex would ultimately become at least as powerful as many governments or worse they would team up together --- just look at all the censorship going on right now - all in the name of "preventing misinformation" its utter shit - who is to say what is or is not misinformation? Are we not capable of coming to our opinions after weighing facts? You need to educate yourself on this topic if you don't recognize this, everyone does - which is the real sad story of all of this - - I mean take a look at what you are saying here - you don't FEEL violated or haven't NOTICED it so it must not be happening - yet - I bet you haven't read much on the topic. I don't mean to offend, but seriously there is so much uncontested knowledge and information out there that absolutely shows how this information is being used to coerce people and violate their own sense of self. By the way --- want to feel it? I used to do a presentation on this to audiences, and I would say: Have you ever had a conversation with a friend about some issue, some concept or some idea, completely offline just to get online and be confronted with ads about the topic? Ever feel like your phone was listening to you? Creepy eh? Now what if I told you this targeting was done without listening to your conversation, that would probably be even more creepy, the fact that something out there is analyzing your behavior and predicting it into the future... well thats todays reality... this was not part of the presentation: all of this can be weaponized to not just predict your behavior, but to then nudge it in a different direction. Cambridge analytica was a great example of this. Now if your only choice is to be treated this way or not be able to participate in society the same way because you "accepted the terms of use" i.e. gave up your rights then I would argue that is in fact fundamentally wrong in so many ways.</p>

        <p>Just like the pcr tests, you're overcycling the legitimate concerns and then using the miniscule extreme to represent the whole.</p>

        <p>&rt;Have the members of this subreddit ever considered that they may actually be the ones in fear?</p>
<p>Afraid of authoritarianism, communism? Sure, that's the whole point of rejecting the new normal. Afraid of the flu? Afraid of measures to prevent the spread of the flu? No, they're just ineffective and therefore useless. Afraid of the "vaccine"? Perhaps, because it's experimental and untested and you have no recourse against manufacturers. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind the vast majority of "conspiracy theories" have been true. So overall no, we aren't afraid - we're just able to think for ourselves rather than thinking the government and media cares about our well being.</p>
