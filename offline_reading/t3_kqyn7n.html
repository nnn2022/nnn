        <p>Note that an individual saying they have an intrinsic right to control others is different from a member of the military or police saying they have a society-granted right to control others under certain circumstances. Not a fair analogy.</p>

        <p>Hence why socialism fails and will always fail- it goes against human nature, it does not incentivize people, so the leaders who implement it will ALWAYS turn into dictators because that is the only way to get people to comply with socialism.</p>

        <p>So what you're saying is all we have to do is force everyone to work under exploited labor conditions for the owning class repeatedly to put bread on the table (even during a pandemic wherein doing so is effectively an act of biological warfare)? Only then can our society get by, by incentivizing the labor necessary for civilization to function? Doesn't that suck? Is that not oppressive in even the slightest bit such that it might force us to even so much as consider abandoning an economic system that has in all likelihood poisoned our planet and our minds? I'm by no means suggesting any sort of conversely authoritarian government body to combat these concerns, they've continually demonstrated themselves as unwilling to do so, as mere subjects of the capitalist system, and historical precedent has shown that similar attempts at confronting capitalism in such a manner lead to fascist dictatorships.</p>

        <p>i'm not a scientist but i know enough that science is centered around posing questions and determining whether something is true or false which done enough times can establish some level of certainty. in other words, science should never be top down (religious/authoritarian manner of thinking) as understanding should be built from the bottom up(agnostic/socratic-i know nothing manner of thinking).</p>

        <p>Spot on mate. If under scrutiny there are inconsistencies then it requires refining to find the correct theory. </p>
<p>To give an example for our doomer friends since 'the science' is on such high pedestal.
So I have a background in software engineering. If I was to write a bit of code, not only would i have have to test it works under the correct conditions but I would have to basically try and break it to find out if I could write a better solution. I wouldnt just check that it held true for one scenario, that is bad code and lazy. Sounds pretty familiar right.</p>

        <p>Imagine every time you wrote some code not only you but every person in the world who coded in that language went over your code to find errors and poke holes in how it functions and slightly modify it until nobody can find any errors.  That’s what science is.  You seem like you have critical thinking skills, maybe do some research.  Nobody is asking you to believe in science, just understand and verify it.  And shit, if you can publish a peer reviewed study that holds up to the test of time and scientific scrutiny that changes our view of COVID, great.  But that hasn’t happened so I am going to look at what the scientific community says and take it very seriously rather than people not actually providing evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>I interpreted your comment as:  "we can't trust scientists, we have to do our own research". But now that I reread it I think you could just mean: "it's not about questioning science, but progress the current state of knowledge by providing your own part on the research".

        <p>1) Please tell me how wearing a mask and having to socialize in small groups (or digitally) is making you suffer more than possible long term effects (e.g. loss of taste, long term breathing problems due to scaring of the lung, increase in chances of getting certain other diseases etc.) or even the death of others. </p>
<p>2) That's such an egoistic view. Congrats that you personally are not affected by it. I've seen a friend die from it and heard enough by stories of relatives working in the hospital. Welp anyway, what you personally experience does not defy the statistics and the dangers of this virus.  </p>

        <p>By your own logic why can't we question your disbelief in female penises? From a purely objective and material perspective gender practically isn't real. Don't you have a holocaust or two to be skeptical about? Also when's the last time you've been to Wyoming, or seen a bird? Fuck it for all we know the universe could've actually started last Wednesday and the flying spaghetti monster implanted fake memories going back years.</p>

        <p>Not even that, basically most of the things around what has happened with SARS-CoV-2 is not science at all.</p>
<p>There is no real strong science behind lockdowns, masks, curfews, border closings, plexiglass screens, treating healthy people with no known contact with someone ill as sick, shamming people and making the world a worst place to defeat a mild respiratory virus.</p>
<p>But even it is isn't science, if "health authorities" say we must do X, then for these brainless bots that is more than sufficient, because "they are the experts and you are not".</p>
<p>Not to mention that none of these assholes have answered me yet as to why do we care so much about this one virus, and not every other virus and illness in existence, even if they kill equally or more people per year.</p>

        <p>...Science absolutely should be questioned <strong><em>but by those who are qualified to do the questioning</em></strong>. You don't get to provide feedback to NASA astrophysicists because you've read an analysis of the Challenger disaster. Hearing a report of cyberattacks does not empower you to reach out to the CIA to let them know where they went wrong. Your success changing a lightbulb does not translate into a successful rewiring of the family home... <strong>and the ability to read English words does not qualify you to question virology, epidemiology or effectively all of medical science.</strong></p>
<p>And I'm curious about all these "it's a cult-ers": If you were to have a heart attack or stroke or be diagnosed with cancer, would you be heading to YouTube for treatment, or a doctor? For all the emergency medical care you (or your family) received in the last 5 years, was it the neighbour with 17 flags on their truck and 24 signs on their front lawn, or a hospital?</p>

        <p>Lol you literally don't get science at all. You're just as bad as the flat earthers saying that shit.</p>
<p>Look, I used to think the same and that science was someone else's job until I actually started reading and practicing it. It's just a means of finding truth, not edicts from a small group of authoritarian elitists that dictate reality to everyone else.</p>
<p>Everyone can do science. Everyone can get a study published if it can survive scrutiny. Science belongs to humanity, not some dipshit anachronistic group of goons cackling while steepling their fingertips during back room meetings at the CDC.</p>
<p>You pro-mask dipshits don't know a thing about science. Shut the fuck up.</p>

        <p>First off, your comments have been reported for abuse and misinformation. Tell this queen to shut the fuck up again, I dare ya.</p>
<p>"Everyone can do science" LOL yeah, sums up the cognitive ability of anti-maskers. I'll enjoy seeing your darwin award a few years from now for trying something that's meant for professionals.</p>
<p>And yes, we participate in science every day. When we boil a kettle, we turn liquids into gasses. When we make coffee, when we do our laundry, when we drive our cars, then yes, we are actively converting energy into something useful for us. That is a given, but that doesn't give you a gold star in Mariokart to do whatever the fuck you want at other's expense.</p>
<p>Jfc you are a whole new level of stupid if you believe this. I wish you luck in your daily struggle with reality.</p>
<p>Oh, and the term "pro-maskers" isn't a thing, because the overwhelming majority think you're the biggest group of idiots and this only seems to be a thing in 'Murica. That's why we have a much more popular term: Covidiots. Aka you.</p>
<p>Oh, and one last thing, WEAR A DAMN MASK! Fucking crybaby.</p>

        <p>So explain why masks and lockdowns made no difference in states and countries that didn't implement them. Let's question it together.</p>
<p>I work in a hospital and almost never wear a mask. I often speak to staff all over the building without a mask as it's only required in hallways and patient care areas. We are all fine. Our families are fine. My roommate and her family are fine. </p>

        <p>First article is has not been peer reviewed, so anything in there should be taken with a grain of salt. Can you give me a TL;DR on it? It’s not very straightforward. </p>
<p>An immediate red flag in the second article is the fact that they were directly comparing deaths and cases of covid to the pandemic from 1918. Medical science has advanced significantly so that’s a bullshit talking point.</p>

        <p>I am sure Stanford epidemiologists would be happy to get your feedback.
How about this science challenging asymptomatic transmissions? Probably not good enough either.

We can go back and forth giving scientific studies and we won’t get anywhere. Just think about the logic. The virus goes from person to person. If people aren’t near each other, the virus won’t spread! Isn’t common sense incredible?</p>

        <p>We have a flu vaccine. I will be opposed to lockdowns, etc. once we have herd immunity via vaccination. </p>
<p>Regarding the study about asymptomatic being less transmissive, there is some truth to that. The problem is, if you are asymptomatic, it’s hard to tell and it’s still possible to infect others. Throwing caution to the wind like that will lead to others getting the virus, putting people with health conditions that leave them vulnerable at risk.</p>

        <p>It's flu season.  I don't know how you could have forgotten that, but it's flu season.  Also, 650,000 people die of heart disease every single year and only this year have they been incorrectly labeled covid deaths.  Also, people die every single day of old age and only this year have they been incorrectly labeled as covid deaths.  </p>
<p>Of course, if you really want to talk about treatments early on that could have saved lives, let's talk about how the democratic governors in America and the left leaning governors of France and the UK completely jumped at the chance to demonize and illegalize hydroxychloroquine the second it was announced as a safe and effective treatment for Covid-19.  That combined with zinc and some vitamin supplements would have saved the lives of thousands and thousands of patients at the very beginning.  It's been used for decades as a safe and effective treatment for a wide variety of illnesses and is even over the counter in some countries.  Pharmacies in America always keep it in stock because it's so commonly used and safe.</p>
<p>Yet the instant President Trump announced it, it was pulled from the shelves and demonized.  France even took it off the market and had it declared toxic.  Are you all so terrified of our president that you have no choice but to destroy a safe treatment measure that has been proven to work over the last few decades?  The media blasted hydroxychloroquine as dangerous and deadly because the liberal government told them to.</p>
<p>Or can we talk about the democratic governors who not only failed to protect nursing homes, but actually signed orders forcing them to keep covid patients?  I mean, nursing homes were very difficult to protect, that's true, but to intentionally use covid patients as hand grenades in nursing homes?  That's just plain evil.  And of course, none of the leaders took responsibility for that either.</p>
<p>Sweden had quite a few deaths because they failed to protect their nursing homes also.  They admitted to that.  Aside from that though, they didn't fare any worse than anyone else who did lock down.  They had their house parties and their beach parties and their fun.  And they didn't do any worse than anyone else.  </p>
<p>and now it's flu season, not covid season.  It's flu season.  People seem to want to ignore that fact.  It's flu season.  Stop pretending influenza doesn't exist.</p>
<p>And on average, 7,000+ people die every day in the United States.  That's how many people die here on a daily basis.  Of course, this year, we're killing people left and right with suicides, missed medical treatments and diagnosis, drug addition, and alcohol abuse.  We're also killing spouses and kids.  In fact, we've had more deaths this year due to lockdowns than we have from Covid if you stop inflating the death count!  Not every death from Heart Disease, Influenza, Old Age, Dementia, etc... is a covid death!  Even the CDC has declared quietly that the count has been overblown by over 90%.</p>
<p>And no- thousands don't die every single day. Once you get Covid, you are done with Covid.  It's a one hit virus.  We all had covid.  Damn near everyone got exposed.  It spread across the entire planet in two months.  Think about that- it spread across the entire planet in just two months.  It spread across the entire planet in just to months.</p>
<p>It simultaneously hit every single nursing home in the entire world.  It hit every single elderly population on the entire planet at the same time.</p>
<p>A virus can't do that without damn near the entire planet being exposed.  EVERYONE got it.  Billions.  And then it was done.  It was over.  That's how viruses work.  They run out of people when they spread that fast.  It hit, it hurt, it died.  It's over.  It ran out of new people.</p>
<p>I was on an Aircraft Carrier leaving Singapore and someone brought on board a really nasty stomach virus.  This thing was really bad!  I was one of the first hit with it.  It spread through the entire ship like Covid did the entire world.  The captain had no choice but to drop anchor in the Pacific just a day out of Singapore.  We sat there motionless while the virus worked through the entire crew of the ship.  I'd say at least half the ship got violently ill for 2 days and then recovered.  Everyone else was fine- their immune systems fought off the virus which is what we call asymptomatic.  After the ship ran its course in about 5 days, we weighed anchor and continued our mission.  The virus was gone.  We had herd immunity.  No one else got sick from it.  It was over.  The virus could not hit us twice.  Our immune systems wouldn't let it.  The virus died out with us.  </p>
<p>That's what happens when viruses run out of bodies.  We have herd immunity.  So no, can't hit millions of new people every single day and kill thousands every single day if the virus has already hit the entire planet at the same time.  That's just not possible.</p>

        <p>How do you know they’re incorrectly labeled? People are dying with old age and heart problems that normally wouldn’t because of covid. </p>
<p>I would really prefer not to politicize this, but the democratic leaders demonized it because there is NO evidence of hydroxychloroquine preventing someone from contracting or developing covid. It’s for malaria and arthritis. Diseases develop and differ from each other. Just because it treats those doesn’t mean it will treat others. That’s an absurd claim. </p>
<p>So having to treat covid patients is evil? It’s not more evil just to let them die  and spread the virus to others? Even with treatment. People die. Without it, we are looking at way more deaths. </p>
<p>Sweden is feeling their mistakes now. Look up “covid cases in Sweden over time” and find a linear graph. Look at the spike in the past 2 months.</p>
<p>Influenza does exist but we have a vaccine. The covid vaccine is still being distributed and until then, the social distancing needs to continue. </p>
<p>Anything that proves everyone had covid? That’s the most insane thing I’ve heard from anyone on this subreddit holy shit. If it’s done why are people still fucking dying to it? Look at the republican congressman-elect from Louisiana. 41 years old, healthy, young, died of covid. </p>
<p>Take that stomach virus story, except use it in a global context. Everyone gets the virus. Then a very large % of elderly people and people with heart problems and breathing problems will die. Millions of millions of deaths. That’s ridiculous. Is that really what you want? Are the deaths of millions justified? Just so you can go out to parties and see friends, and go to work sooner? So you don’t have to social distance or wear a mask? Are the deaths of millions that unimportant to you?</p>

<p>Citation Needed.  Prove that these people who are dying of old age would still be alive a year from now without covid.  That kind of diagnoses would require an autopsy and that is done after the death certificate has been filled out (and usually is not done unless requested by the family).  So no, you can't know that and you certainly can't prove it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

It’s for malaria and arthritis. Diseases develop and differ from each other. Just because it treats those doesn’t mean it will treat others. That’s an absurd claim.</p>
<p>But it is politicized.  The Democrats did everything I said that they did and that's easily proven with internet searches.  And there is MOUNTAINS of evidence about hydroxychloroquine.  It's been used for decades.  Decades.  Do you know what that word means?  That's tens of years.  I think it's been in use for over 50 years.  It's treated many serious illnesses including malaria.  Surely you know how deadly malaria is.  And doctors have spoken up about how they themselves have used hydroxychloroquine to treat their covid patients and they've been fired over it.  Videos have been deleted by YouTube, web pages have been taken down by <a href="https://GoDaddy.com">GoDaddy.com</a>, and doctors have been fired.  All this happened because they spoke up about how hydroxychloroquine is safe and effective at treating covid patients.  That makes it a political issue.  That's the very essence of a political issue.  If you don't want to politicize this then you need to tuck tail and go find someone else to talk to because I'm going there.  I'm not going to censor this discussion because you're too afraid to have it.  This is not r/LockdownSkepticism.  We discuss the real issues here.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So having to treat covid patients is evil? It’s not more evil just to let them die  and spread the virus to others? Even with treatment. People die. Without it, we are looking at way more deaths.</p>
<p>You tell me, buddy.  Why are you for silencing doctors for daring to discuss the evidence behind hydroxychloroquine?  Why do you want that evidence hidden?  You're the one on the side of evil here.  If that saves lives as it has countless times in the past being the wonder drug that it is, why does it frighten you so much?   I'll wait for an answer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Sweden is feeling their mistakes now. Look up “covid cases in Sweden over time” and find a linear graph. Look at the spike in the past 2 months.</p>
<p>No, actually they aren't and neither is South Dakota or Florida (which barely locked down) and right now, IT'S FLU SEASON.  I asked you to stop ignoring that fact.  I'll ask again.  Stop ignoring flu season.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Influenza does exist but we have a vaccine. The covid vaccine is still being distributed and until then, the social distancing needs to continue.</p>
<p>We have a vaccine?  And it still kills over half a million people world-wide every single year?  In the 2017-2018 flu season, I'm pretty sure the death toll of influenza may have topped 1 million world-wide even though we have a flu vaccine.  Why is that?  I mean, if your defense is, "We have a vaccine for the flu", then why is it still killing over half a million (if not a million) world-wide every single year?  That's not hospitalizations- that's deaths.   The flu puts tens of millions if not more in the hospital each year.  It can put as many as 810,000 in the hospital in America alone.  Oh, but we have a vaccine!  So.... that means that those people don't matter?  Millions of people just don't matter to you because we have a vaccine?   I'm just trying to understand your point of view here.  Why is that a defense?  Did you know that in 1918, influenza is credited for 50,000,000 deaths world-wide?  Did you know that over 650,000 Americans died that flu season to the flu?   Still going to say "Oh, but we have a vaccine"?  Still don't understand why you think the flu no longer matters.  I would think over half a million deaths each year would be significant enough to warrant concern, but I guess not.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Anything that proves everyone had covid? That’s the most insane thing I’ve heard from anyone on this subreddit holy shit. If it’s done why are people still fucking dying to it? Look at the republican congressman-elect from Louisiana. 41 years old, healthy, young, died of covid.</p>
<p>Oh can you provide a proven method of transmission that infects the entire planet at the same time yet doesn't infect anyone in the process?  I want scientific journals only, please.  Show me.  I want to see a model that shows how a virus can blanket an entire planet and not infect anyone.  Maybe that's why the Democratic governors forced covid patients into nursing homes.  They special ordered them, didn't they?  That's how all the nursing homes got hit at the same time, right?  The sick people were special ordered and inserted into each home- and THAT is why no one now has the virus after 14 whole months, right?  Right?  I mean... you tell me!  You're the one who believes this crap.  You tell me how it happened.  Either provide a model or shut up.  Don't just call me wrong.  Let's see it.  Was the virus mail-order or not?</p>

<p>Well, show me an alternative.  Show me the mail-order virus installation into nursing homes.  I want to see it.</p>

        <p>Yeah tell that too the Church of Scientology 
In all seriousness science can be a religion </p>
<p>People need to believe in something(observation of both Dostoevsky and Nietzsche) and well they can choose for it too be religion, but it will something like politics, science etc.    </p>
<p>Replacing the morality of a religion is the real difficulty.  Politics and Science are by default materialistic philosophies they only deal with the world.   But religion deals with people’s morality and spirituality which Are both things that Are harder to quantify</p>
