    <strong>Have Yall seen the 2005 Pandemic Lockdown Plan</strong>

<p>- they had already decided on masks</p>
<p>- the military was always ready to "devise new methods to activate its capacities "</p>
<p>- the companies were always ready to increase surveillance</p>
<p>- the government had already planned for "sustained absenteeism" from jobs</p>
<p>- they had already invented the term "essential workers"</p>
<p>- they had already decided to invest in vaccines instead of antivirals "especially new kinds that treat multiple strains"</p>
<p>-  they had already decided to go virtual</p>
<p>- they had already decided to institute this plan not only in the United States but globally</p>
<p>But in the end the people didn't get riled up. The lockdown never happened. The CDC reported 98 deaths worldwide in the pandemic predicted to be the "worst since the 1918 Flu."  </p>
<p>The only things the government didn't figure out in 14 years between their first pandemic plan to their 2019 version: How to support its people</p></p>
