    <strong>I'm curious, how many of you believe that the virus is dangerous but just disagree with lockdowns, rushed vaccines, infringement on your rights, etc.</strong>
    <p><p>Personally, I think the virus can be deadly and may result in chronic health issues even for young people. I've followed this virus closely since January and as a younger guy I don't really think I'll die if I catch it. Rather, I fear that this virus could drastically lower my quality of life years down the road.</p>
<p>Do you all think it's a hoax? Or do some of you just want it to be handled better?</p></p>

        <p>I don’t believe the virus is dangerous at all. Last time I checked, it had a 99.98% survival rate for my age group and the average age of death for coronavirus is over the average life expectancy. </p>
<p>Honestly, even if it was deadly I still wouldn’t advocate for lockdowns. I’d rather kill myself than live like an antisocial shut-in loser for the rest of my life. Why am I being threatened with house arrest in a free country? Why can’t I go to school? Why can’t I socialize freely like I did 10 months ago? Did 95 year old smokers with comorbidities never die until this pesky virus came along? Be real.</p>
<p>The economy has gone to shit, I have nothing left to live for and you expect me to be scared of a fucking virus? I lost my self-preservation when I lost my will to live. I lost my will to live when the lockdowns were introduced. I’d rather take my 99.98% chance than let millions of people go into poverty, crime, unemployment, starvation, domestic abuse, depression and suicides.</p>
<p>Fuck these lockdowns and anyone that advocates for them. They’re ruining the lives of countless young people in a desperate attempt to immortalize the bed-ridden elderly.</p>

        <p>I believe it's dangerous to people who are already dying. Those people should be given guidance to take precautions if they want. For almost everybody, this is a non-issue. It's the flu, give or take. I'm not scared of the flu, and I'm not scared of this.</p>
<p>Symptoms that last forever are the lie they tell you to scare you because they know the statistics show you are at essentially no risk. You're at more risk from lockdowns drastically lowering your quality of life.</p>

        <p>Covid hit me hard and I'm not in a risk group, barely affected my family.  I'm also 100% fine now.  I think its worse than the flu for some people, but the lockdowns made it worse not better because we are trickling out people and never getting heard immunity which is a thing.</p>

        <p>I definitely don't think it's as dangerous as they claim it to be. They went from reporting deaths to reporting cases. All other illnesses have ceased to exist. </p>

        <p>Speaking of cases, any one else see the very large disproportionate amount of active cases in certain countries.  Especially the US.  </p>
<p>For most that feel any symptoms at all, they seem to get over it within a few weeks.  Total amount of cases in the US is over 17 million.  This is over the past, what, nine months now.  And it shows over 7 million active cases still.  Look at other countries, their total cases and active cases.  Why is the US so disproportionate?  Are other countries getting over this just that much faster?  What are they doing that the US needs to do?</p>
<p>Or, are they purposely keeping the numbers inflated...   hmmm... bingo!</p>

        <p>I don't know of a single person who thinks it's a hoax.  It's the fact that the cure is causing more harm than the virus.  The fact that a governor apparently has the power to arbitrarily pick which businesses can stay open and which ones must shut down scares the hell out of me.  No one man should have that much power.  Then you have the national debt, shitty online education, poverty, suicide, mental issues, and dispair these lockdown have caused.</p>

        <p>It’s not dangerous to anyone who is healthy and under the age of 50. You can still get sick but you will fully recover and be fine. I think older people (especially 70+) have a decision to make. But shutting down society for this particular virus is the most ludicrous thing I have ever seen. I can’t even fathom how some people think any of this is justified.</p>

        <p>I definitely believe the virus is real but no worse than the flu. And yeah yeah, "Tell that to the people that died!!!!!!!!!!" but people die of the flu too. I don't think it's a pandemic. Just a bad flu. At first, I actually believed a tiny of bit of the danger because of how scary it looked in China with everything closed, but quickly realized what was going on. Even if this virus was practically a death sentance to anyone who came down with it, that never, ever, supercedes free will. Yes, security is important, but in the end, freedom is more important. Seeing how not-serious this actually turned out to be, and especially with the importance of freedom in mind, I don't think anything should have been done, except maybe closing schools for a week or so if they get a lot of sick kids since if they're sick they wouldn't be there anyway. But forcing people to stand apart in lines? Wearing a mask? Telling people not to get to close just because of a virus? All of that is waaaaaaay too far.</p>

        <p>It can be dangerous for some people, but I do still disagree with lockdowns, rushed vaccines and the whole nine yards. People need to use their brains and decide their own level of risk (and act accordingly), instead of having the government do it for everyone across the board as a blanket approach.</p>

<li>I think the virus sucks and is dangerous. Healthier friends than me had it and just felt like shit for 2 weeks. Guess what they then still have all the same restrictions just not the anxiety of getting it.</li>
<li>I believe in the vaccine, I have been watching and reading about mRNA vaccines before this and they will change the game. I’m more worried putting a “deactivated” virus in me.</li>
<li>I don’t believe in lockdowns. Should restaurants and other indoor activities encourage people to be 6 apart and not seat directly? Sure, but closing completely is useless.</li>
<li>I believe in masks ONLY if it means no restrictions. I don’t understand why we need a lockdown I’d masks work and why the flu is gone but Covid is high.</li>
<li>I argue more deaths happen from smoking related illness yet we kept cigarette sales going during a pandemic.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly I don’t agree with forced vaccination</p>

        <p>For the longest time I was under the belief members of my family would die horribly if they got "the virus".Then I actually found it out by myself that there hadn't been any flu cases this year..I noticed that as time passed they added more and more symptoms to covid-19 to make it an all-catch, basically anything can be a symptom of covid-19 now.</p>
<p>Then I started browsing the internet, found other people doubting this, so I researched my countrys official death statistics. If there's a pandemic, surely there would be an excess of deaths or at least some visible indicator people were dying.What I found out was there were some excess deaths early spring but after 1 july it's been completely in line with the past 10 years average.Doesn't sound like an ongoing pandemic to me.</p>
<p>What things other than a virus can kill people that explains early spring in Sweden?Making the old in elder care facilities stay still indoors for a long time is most likely one of the main reasons, as well as forcing people to go on ventilators who really shouldn't need it.Ventilator associated pneumonia is a condition common from ventilators, my guess is a lot of deaths are from that.</p>
<p>It's a hoax.</p>

<p>this entire is a hoax of near unbelievable gigantic proportions from the start with no end of it in sight, because it will only end with our total submission to the global, totalitarian technocratic, communist dictatorship that they are busy implementing after decades of planning.</p>
<p>common cold virus that everyone in the 'civilized' world has had, a fake ass non-'test', 90% 'asymptomatic (not sick) cases', rule change to inflate 'deaths', financial incentives to inflate  'cases' and 'deaths'....</p>
<p>how can anyone fall for this hoax? </p>
<p>and since when did anyone give any fucks about their fellow man?  i see plenty of homeless, i see plenty of poor. i do not and have seen any true 'charity'</p>
<p>it is 'illegal' for me to take my grill to the homeless and feed them hot dogs and burgers myself at no charge.</p>
<p>anyone who believes that the lying, thieving, murderous state or it's well paid minions gives a single fuck about your or anyone else's health or safety, but their own, is delusional and suffers a severe case of stockholm syndrome</p>

        <p>It’s deadly to sick people. </p>
<p>It’s not going to lower your quality of life if you’re young. That’s media fear mongering and you need to wake up and stop being brainwashed. As a young person you are way more risk of other things giving you long term effects.</p>

        <p>This is quite interesting. The media initially spun the 5g conspiracy as <em>causing</em>  the virus. This was a great play because that logically makes no sense and most people easily discredit this. </p>
<p>The real story, in my opinion, is that people are actually getting sick but it’s from the brand-new 5g towers, not a virus.</p>
<p>If you look at an overlay of the first cities to get 5g, you’ll see Wuhan, Lombardy, New York, etc. </p>
<p>Reason should say that cities like Delhi, Bangkok would have been demolished by now. But they are conveniently relatively “covid” and 5g free. </p>
<p>An incredible amount of 5g towers were put up in March when the lockdown started. The lockdown that was based on PCR testing- not real bodies. Check the total death rates for 19 vs 20.</p>
<p>I know how this sounds, but in my opinion people are getting microwaved. Some symptoms of EMF poisoning are loss of taste and smell, the lungs not being able to uptake oxygen, etc. </p>
<p>Most of the media that convinced me of this theory has been long-ago deleted so it’s up to the researcher to find them. A good place to start would be the video of that ER doctor describing how his “covid” patients has symptoms of altitude poisoning. </p>
<p>This theory is the pinnacle of ridicule by the masses, but if you look around at historical track record of TPTB, it’s the most logical. </p>
<p>The whole point of the above is the vaccine. The entire goal of covid is to inject god-only-knows what’s in that shot.</p>
<p>Regardless of your perspective, good luck out there.</p>

        <p>I want to preface my response to this with:</p>
<ul>
<li>COVID is real, though whether natural or manmade, I’m not sure</li>
<li>I am the opposite of an anti-vaxxer</li>
<li>The raw data presented by the health organizations prove that it is not dangerous</li>
<li>The media narrative and recommendations from non-censored health officials does not match the data</li>
<li>It’s being overblown to usher in the next step towards a technocratic dictatorship and massive depopulation</li>
<li>Masks are BS</li>
<li>Lockdowns are draconian BS</li>
<li>This vaccine is rushed BS</li>
<li>I love a good conspiracy theory</li>
</ul>
<p>With all that said:</p>
<ul>
<li>Correlation does not equal causation</li>
<li>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc is a logical fallacy</li>
</ul>
<p>Just because a city has a 5G tower and COVID and COVID came afterwards, does not mean that one causes the other.</p>
