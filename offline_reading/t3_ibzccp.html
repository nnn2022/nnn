        <p>I have to agree with your headline, OP, and with the tweet itself. This basically sums up the reaction from both sides. I know a lot of people here believe the Republicans are doing a good job, but...........ugh. I don't feel like they are doing everything they can to fight for us. A government's first job is to serve its people, ideally anyway. But our politicals have failed us, even before this, it's just that now the situation is worse.</p>

        <p>I have always managed to suppress my natural reaction to the politician class, which is to see them as useless/antagonistic parasites, in deference to my deep wish just to be left the hell alone. Now that I am not being given the opportunity to just be left the hell alone, I am becoming politicized. None of the people out there, not even theoretical third parties, are speaking coherently. I "wasted my vote" three times on Ralph Nader. He's the kind of person we need and the kind of person the system specifically excludes, and I don't see any Naders. (Selfless pioneers for the greater good.) I see the absolute worst of the worst. People I wouldn't have lunch with.</p>

<p>The Governor of SD for example is doing a fantastic job, while I can't think of a single democratic official that is against all of the measures taken, or is fighting against them.</p>

        <p>I wish DeSantis would reign in Miami-Dade County. They've gone absolutely crazy; people are getting $100+ tickets for not wearing a mask outdoors. They've had police officers camping out in Publix parking lots to catch people taking their masks off when leaving. Fortunately, I live in Palm Beach, where we just have to deal with our local government spending millions of dollars in tax money on pro-masks advertising and sending out masks to literally every single mailing address.</p>

        <p>I wish Desantis was more hands on. He threatens to put force but then let's the mayors do whatever the hell they want. Some cities have mask mandates, curfews and closed "non essential" places. It isnt NYC levels of lockdown but it is really annoying when call him " DeathSantis" when really he hasn't pushed enough of the reopening process.</p>

        <p>If anything, we'd be better off with a lack of leadership. The problems we currently face all stem from our leaders supposedly trying to help us when they should just fucking stop doing anything at all. Tyranny in the name of good will is the worst, especially when dealing with larger nations because "good" and "bad" mean something different to everyone. No one person - or even so many as several hundred people - should attempt to lead millions and millions of others.</p>

        <p>Eh, I'm more going for a peaceful-as-possible mass decentralization movement. Something about large governments, large corporations, large populations, etc has always struck me as wrong, but I didn't really have the vocabulary to explain why until maybe my late teens. Now I know: Humans are social animals, yes, but only to a certain extent. We can't genuinely give a fuck about more than maybe a few hundred people at the absolute most. To expect otherwise is folly, and only results in pushing one man down to lift another man up.</p>

        <p>This was a heated topic of discussion during the founding of the United States after the Revolutionary war (federalism vs. anti-federalism). The anti-federalists <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/us/16b.asp">"believed that the greatest threat to the future of the United States lay in the government's potential to become corrupt and seize more and more power until its tyrannical rule completely dominated the people."</a> Looks like they were right.</p>
<p>If I had a magic wand, I'd transform America into a confederation of states, where the federal government has minimal power, and I'd establish a constitution that much more explicitly limits the growth of federal power. I'd also implement state constitutions that limit the power of state legislatures/executives in favor of local governance whenever possible. Then I'd probably have to do it again in 250 years because governments only accumulate power and grow in size.</p>
<p>It's too bad that the word "confederacy" and the concept of states' rights have both been so tainted in public discourse because of slavery and the Civil War. You can't even have a discussion about it without a lot of people immediately filing you away as a far right edgelord, even though there's nothing inherently right-wing about anti-federalism.</p>

        <p>This is why I hate when people say "the Founding Fathers would've [this]" as if they were some single-minded entity. No, there was much disagreement, especially between....Jefferson and Hamilton, if I recall correctly? Apparently I have a similar personality as Jefferson, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p>If I had a magic wand, I'd transform America (and maybe the rest of the world) into communities of 25 to 250 individuals with a healthy balance of tradition, progress, self-sufficiency, and travel/trade between other communities to prevent issues arising from incest and xenophobia. But your idea is good too, much better than our current situation. And I agree that the process would require repeating every so often. The growth and eventual implosion of government seems to be a natural cycle, like the change of seasons.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I was reading a thread about reclaiming the swastika as a symbol for good. Why can't the same be done for, say, the rebel flag? Just a thought.</p>

<p>An interesting thought, but it's easier said than done when academia and the media have a significant over-representation of people from a minority demographic that has very strong feelings on those two symbols in particular.</p>

        <p>I think there is something to be said for this idea of human-scale communities, problems, solutions, etc.</p>
<p>So many things in our world are deliberately built beyond the scale of humans.  We cannot conceptualize them, we can barely perceive them, we cannot change them.  When it comes to trillion dollar companies, the size the federal government, the sheer scale of cities and similar institutions, etc, we are like ants trying to perceive a skyscraper.</p>
<p>We don't have the natural intuition and skills to interact with these social structures and a world simultaneously so intimately globalized and yet remote.  These organizations develop a kind of mind of their own.  They are beyond individual human influence.</p>

        <p>&rt;Anarcho-fascism is based on the premise that in post-capital societies, racial identitarianism loses its stigma. Anarcho-fascism or national (nationalist) anarchism propounds that only ethnic cohesion can form self-referential societies in the wake of capitalism's collapse.</p>

        <p>Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.

        <p>I would argue that in a very real sense we are looking at specific failures in the state leadership that is causing so much hardship.  The governors specifically have overreacted and based their decisions ENTIRELY on failed models and supposed medical experts.  But any thinking person should realize that is but one tiny part of decision-making for an entire state.  They completely disregarded any other inputs into their decision-making process.  </p>
<p>So, don't just blame "politicians".  That allows all of them to escape responsibility.  Put the blame on your state governor, and take action based on that (voting, writing, whatever).  The more we just blame faceless politicians means fewer actual politicians are held accountable.</p>

        <p>This is exactly right.  I've never been so motivated to vote in my life, and it turns out, ANGER is a truly great motivator!  I'm disgusted with the acts of my governor and his pathetic attempts to destroy the entire state's economy, and can't wait to cast a vote against him.  I hope you get rid of Governor Blackface, and hopefully we can vote out limpdicked Roy Cooper in NC as well.</p>

        <p>The problem is not democracy, or more precisely the problem is not a representational republic, the form of government in the U.S.</p>
<p>The problem is the growing techno-totalitarianism by global tech corporations. </p>
<p>How does content gets censored and removed by Facebook and Twitter? Because these tech giants utilize a law loophole which says corporations are private individuals and can determine their terms of service--and that means platforms such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc are NOT public spaces and so 1st Amendment rights are not protected.</p>
<p>And THAT is precisely how individual voices and ideas are being censored and squelched. </p>
<p>It is TECH COMPANIES  deplatforming, censoring , demonetizing and silencing dissenting views, NOT the U.S. government. As a society we don't use the public square anymore to gather and discuss ideas, we now have digital spaces, but they are under private company control. </p>
<p>In other countries such as China, the problem is government sanctioned techno-totalitarianism, which might happen in the U.S. if we don't take measures soon.</p>

        <p>In America, it is rights-centric thinking that gives rise to a market that allows Twitter, et al., to dominate the commons, and there is no Constitutional way to attack the problem. That's the problem. To turn the ship from rights-centric thinking to responsibility-centric thinking would be to end the USA as we know it. That's what I want. Balkanization, leading to smaller, more organic, more meaningful governments/leaders that more closely follow the needs/skills of the people living there, giving rise to, hopefully, one state that throws out Rights as the core conceptual underpinning of that state in favor of Responsibilities.</p>
<p>edit: I am tired of pretending that I automatically have anything in common with strangers 2000 miles away simply because we share a passport. American culture is mostly nauseating, and I am tired of even discussing transexuality, for one example. I want a different place, without those people and without wasting everyone's time discussing it. You want pedophile tranny story hour at your libraries? Fine. I want to part of it. Not for me, not for the people around me, not for anyone I ever come in contact with. I don't want to tell you at a city council why pedophile tranny story hour at the library is a bad idea. I don't want to discuss it. Ever. EVER.</p>

        <p>&rt; So, don't just blame "politicians". That allows all of them to escape responsibility. Put the blame on your specific state governor, and take action based on that (voting, writing, protesting, whatever). The more we just blame faceless politicians means fewer actual individual politicians are held accountable.</p>
<p>Eh, no. The vast majority of politicians are to blame, including the "red" ones who caved in, whether to lockdowns and/or to masks. The only governor who's stayed strong, and seems to look out for her people is Noem in South Dakota, who never instituted any shutdown. Wisely so.</p>

        <p>I think people should blame politicians as a whole because the vast majority of them are self-serving assholes who only care about their vain attempts at maintaining their status quos. Right now, the political system is extremely corrupt, as displayed by this whole fiasco. I think all the governors should be held accountable, except Noem who never instituted any sort of lockdown or restriction in her state in the name of "public safety". Even Kemp caved into mask mandates eventually, which is shameful.</p>

        <p>What if I told you that you have a lot in common with those you oppose? That what you care about is cooperation, and the <em>ideas</em> that you oppose want cooperation too. However, presently, people use those ideas to campaign for non-cooperation, so you perceive the ideas themselves as being that. The solution to fighting this opposition is not doing away with all of these ideas, many of which are good, but instead of doing away with those people and the incentives that created them.</p>
