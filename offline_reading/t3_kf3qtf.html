        <p>That's actually true, to a degree. Being on the road is dangerous. You have a much higher chance of being harmed going to the store to pick up your massive jug of hand sanitizer than you do from being directly harmed from this virus. Yet no one is afraid of stepping behind the wheel, but they're deathly terrified and paranoid about this weak as fuck virus. So while we're at it, can we reduce the speed limit to 15mph to reduce the massive number of car-related incidents?</p>
<p>So yes, if you're terrified of this weak as fuck virus, you can stay home. Just like if you're truly afraid of being harmed by a drunk driver, you can stay home. It's easier than ever to stay home and be lazy. But we deal with dangers every single day. If someone truly cared about not harming others, they'd stay home and interact as little as possible with everyone rlse. In which case, everyone else could go live their lives. But no, instead, people feel the need to go out in public and demand that every person and every business be as terrified and paranoid about this virus as they are, and to adhere to their own standards of safety and sanitation, all because they "just haaad to get their fire af Starbeez pumpkin spice latte" - putting themselves and countless others "at risk" by interacting with others out in public.</p>
<p>You also need to weigh the indirect consequences of each action. Maybe the drunk driver tosses a bottle out of the window and it smacks someone in the head and kills them. Incredibly unlikely though. On the other hand, the indirect consequences of forced mask mandates, "socially distancing", and all these business restrictions in place because of this paranoia are massive. Huge psychological issues, mental health issues, educational issues, economic issues, not to mention a large infringement on personal freedom and responsibility.</p>
<p>In addition, DUI and OUI are outright highly illegal in every. Mask-wearing is not even mandatory in every state, let alone illegal, and the implementation of the mandates very incredibly wildly. When someone drives drunk, there's a relatively very good chance that they'll harm themselves or many others. On the flip side, when someone doesn't wear a mask, there's a possible chance that they maybe sorta kinda pass the virus to someone else. If someone happens to catch the virus, there's a very slim chance that they kinda maybe sorta end up even just being harmed from it. Two totally different comparisons there.</p>
<p>Let people live their lives. Protect the vulnerable, and take whatever personal precautions and preventative health measures you'd like to, in order to make you feel safe. That's all that's needed.</p>
