    <strong>Mods please pin this, its a study on the effectiveness of mask wearing.</strong>
    <p><p>[<a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817</a>]</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>Observational evidence suggests that mask wearing mitigates transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is uncertain if this observed association arises through protection of uninfected wearers (protective effect), via reduced transmission from infected mask wearers (source control), or both.</p>
<h2>Objective:</h2>
<p>To assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were uncommon and not among recommended public health measures.</p>
<h2>Design:</h2>
<p>Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19 Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04337541)</p>
<h2>Setting:</h2>
<p>Denmark, April and May 2020.</p>
<h2>Participants:</h2>
<p>Adults spending more than 3 hours per day outside the home without occupational mask use.</p>
<h2>Intervention:</h2>
<p>Encouragement to follow social distancing measures for coronavirus disease 2019, plus either no mask recommendation or a recommendation to wear a mask when outside the home among other persons together with a supply of 50 surgical masks and instructions for proper use.</p>
<h2>Measurements:</h2>
<p>The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mask wearer at 1 month by antibody testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or hospital diagnosis. The secondary outcome was PCR positivity for other respiratory viruses.</p>
<h2>Results:</h2>
<p>A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; <em>P</em> = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; <em>P</em> = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.</p>
<h2>Limitation:</h2>
<p>Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.</p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection.</p></p>

        <p>Most importantly, it was an actual STUDY. Too many lab experiments involving spray nozzles, manikin heads and bits of cloth have called themselves ‘studies’.</p>

        <p>Its only one study, and it has its limits, but I'm not going to hide that because thats non-scientific.</p>

        <p>It's also important to note the <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-7499">editorial response</a> to this study:</p>
<p>&rt; The specifics of the study setting limit not only its statistical power but also the generalizability of findings. The study was done in a setting with relatively low transmission: During the first week of May, the daily incidence of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in Denmark was roughly one third of that in the United Kingdom and one quarter of that in the United States (6). Furthermore, the study was underpowered for subgroup analyses by occupation, time out of home (although more time out of home was associated with a greater trend toward protection, as shown in Supplement Figure 2 [5]), and other factors. Thus, the potential benefit of mask wearing in particular circumstances or settings could not be assessed.</p>
<p>&rt; In addition, a mask recommendation or self-report of use does not equate with correct mask wearing; among persons who wear masks during high-risk exposures, risk for infection may be reduced significantly (3). In DANMASK-19, only 46% of those in the intervention group reported adherence to the intervention.</p>
