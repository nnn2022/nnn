    <strong>No more masks</strong>
    <p><p>My boss just told us we can take our masks off. He recommended that those who are not vaccinated continue wearing them but that everyoneâ€™s personal decisions about their own health will be respected by the company. Feeling very lucky to work with such an understanding and down to earth crew. I have very frank and open discussions with my coworkers about my decision not to vaccinate and we have always treated each other with the utmost respect, regardless of whether weâ€™re inoculated against covid or not. 
I feel for all the people forced to exist in a tyrannical workplace and I hope things turn around soon for yâ€™all. Just sharing my story of hope because so much is doom and gloom in this sub. Go do the exact work that you want to! I repair boats and all my coworkers are here because they want to be. When people start working jobs they hate because they have to, they become used to subjecting themselves to discomfort and end up getting steamrolled because theyâ€™re not standing up for what they love. I know some of you are stuck, but think about what your goals were as a child and donâ€™t stop fantasizing and dreaming about the worthwhile ideals you want to shape your life. Things will get better as long as you donâ€™t let go of your ideals.</p></p>

        <p>This is just another ploy to divide us. First it was the masks. Now it's a non FDA approved vaccine. Vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. We need to just stand up and say enough is enough, take the masks off, get back to normal and continue on with our lives.</p>

If you aren't vaccinated it's masked public humiliation time but I just ordered one of those mesh masks and if the doesn't fly one completely breathable but looks like a real one, it's like an anti-mask in disguise.</p>

        <p>I think we should all be asking our employers, school administrators, etc, sign documents accepting liability for any damages which may result from prolonged mask use, from testing, or from vaccination if that is the case. Doesn't matter if the document is not prepared by a lawyer; just write some shit up yourself. If they don't like it, ask them to come back with something more suitable to them. Make them work for it. People don't realize that the "mandates" are mostly theatrical and are designed to psychologically pressure you, but when it comes down to the actual law, cops and employers and anyone enforcing this shit are on very thin ice, and may even be opening themselves up to be held <em>personally</em> liable, if anything violates international human rights standards. Just ask them to clarify, legally. Or even just ask them to put their policy in writing, without bringing liability into the equation. The worst thing you can do is go along with some requirement that was just verbally passed on to you, and realize later that you basically did this of your own will, when you had every right to make them put it in writing.</p>

        <p>That is what I was thinking of doing after I typed that, it's the least I can do if I have no choice but leave or use one of the one's that I can't breathe in and need to put holes in but then suffer the consequences of breathing in the fibers from it for hours.  I don't come home feeling very good I can say that much. It's that or leave but I need the money right now or I can kiss the future goodbye and that's something I'm not going to let happen.</p>

        <p>I'm curious about the breathable but realistic fake mask you mention. I may recommend this to some people who are stuck with wearing a mask many hours a day.</p>
<p>I am sick of playing these games personally, have been going into stores without the mask on at all etc. This is very rare in my area so it has the potential to get tense but I'm just so sick of this shit.</p>
<p>With work I sort of plan to push back "legally" like I describe but it still won't come into play until a few weeks from now probably. That's the unfortunate thing about all this is that they are just wearing us down and picking us off one by one and not letting us get solid footing or all be fighting back at the same time.</p>
<p>And they want to humiliate and degrade people who don't get the vaccine. It's fucking evil.</p>

Now hopefully it comes in quickly. </p>
<p>I haven't worn a mask this entire time and have gotten into a couple manger arguements that always ended with "just finish up quickly" in both cases. Some comments here and ther. It is tense because here more than 99% of people are masked and not doing anything about it even if they disagree and know that this is a major human rights violation or now many of them. </p>
<p>Yes they are wearing us down, that's why they're playing this long game of course. It's not easy but at least I can sleep at night knowing I'm doing the right thing and what I can, that's what keeps me on my toes. I can't betray myself, people I love, or the world I knew before this that was not perfect in any way but so much brighter. I'll take the humiliation though over the poison, what is happening right now is in my lifetime the most pure manifestation of evil we have ever seen.</p>

        <p>â€˜Complianceâ€™means following CDC guidance. The very fact that fully vaccinated people are extremely hesitant to comply with CDC guidance speaks of deeper, more sinister things. The manipulation of PRC testing cycles, the manipulation of outdoor transmission rates (10% versus actual 1%) the complete shutdown of debate on the issue and finally the enlistment ( paid enlistment) of â€˜influencersâ€™ to push the narrative reeks of high government ( worldwide) agendas.</p>

        <p>Wow, thanks for posting this. Really needed to read something like this today as for the past few days have really been contemplating whether or not to find a new job considering the horrible conditions of evening forced to wear a mask for 40+ hours a week. I live in Florida and have no state nor local mandate yet my job still imposes these rules and doesnâ€™t allow us the option to choose. Itâ€™s unfortunate since I have tried to deal the best I could and personally donâ€™t wear a mask anywhere except @ work. I have suffered some side effects from continuous mask wearing and have no considerations from my employer.  Your post inspires me and reminds me that happiness can be found and I shouldnâ€™t just continue settles. Thanks for the motivation to seek out better options!</p>

        <p>Happy to read something positive, thank you!!! Wishing you the absolute best in your career and your life.  Iâ€™m out west in the legal MJ industry...just worked my first day at a beautiful hydroponic greenhouse...they didnâ€™t say shit about the shot during my interview a month ago but now my boss asks if Iâ€™ve had the injection?  Not sure what to do.  This is the best company Iâ€™ve ever had the chance to work for.  Imagine landing a job at BMW after working at AutoZone and thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m at.  Part of me would inject motor oil into my veins to keep learning from em.</p>
