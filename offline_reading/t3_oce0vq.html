    <strong>So... Can we post our bans here or not?</strong>
    <p><p>I guess this is a question for the Mods, whom I have messaged a few times about this with no response.</p>
<p>It appears as though many of us are getting "pre banned" from subs we've never participated in, simply for participating in this sub (NNN).</p>
<p>I find this to be interesting, and pertinent information.  However, seeing a million posts about the same thing over and over again seems redundant.</p>
<p>Why hasn't a sticky post been made for "posts your bans here"?  It seems like a very logical next step to satisfy everyone.</p>
<p>Three days ago I started getting some pre bans like many are posting here now.  I posted about these as many people are now doing, <em>and I was subsequently banned from NNN for two days!</em>.  What??</p>
<p>So, are all of these people posting about their bans in other subs getting banned now in this one too?  </p>
<p>Or...  What's going on with the rules??</p>
<p><strong>It feels like the Mods should make this more clear.</strong></p>
<p>If we're not allowed to post our bans in other subreddits, that needs to be made more clear.  If we are, why don't we have a sticky where we can keep all of that information together in one place?  (And why did I get banned for posting it while others didn't??).</p>
<p>I've messaged the Mods about this a few times and no response.  I'm sure they are busy, and I'm not trying to call them out or anything.  But like, how about we not ban allies for breaking rules which were just updated, and which most of us didn't even know existed?</p>
<p>I'd love to know other people's opinion about this.</p></p>

        <p>Better yet, why don't we just acknowledge which communities (and their mods) are banning commenters/subscribers of NNN?</p>
<p>We just need to assume that anyone who has ever participated in a post on NNN will be banned from those communities.</p>
<p>We need to call out the mods who took it upon their paper tyrant selves to ban people who've done nothing bad in their particular subs. They're the smallest of the small. Egos shattered by mere comments. Sad. /u/n8thegr8 is one such small loser, and is responsible for the latest round of <em>wrongthink</em> bans.</p>

        <p>Here's an interesting thought about those bans: Aren't they a form of harassment? Sending unsolicited PMs is against Reddit's rules for bots and those automated bans always send those messages.</p>
<p>Well this has been done for a long time and getting an admin response is nigh impossible. It would be funny if someone made a "good people sub" and automatically banned everyone posting in those big subs targeting NNN, calling them horrible people via the ban message. I bet that would bring on an admin response real quick. Sadly, I doubt that there would be any consistency in enforcement of Reddit's rules in that case.</p>

        <p>Everybody that has gotten, or does get, any ban from unrelated subs like that, please report each of them as harassment to the Reddit admins.</p>
<p>After reporting a couple, I think that most ways of reporting them <em>probably</em> simply go back to the offending sub mods.</p>
<p>The way to be sure that a harassment report goes to reddit admins seems to be ONLY by doing it exactly this way (I'm sorry if I'm mistaken here, but this is the best I've got so far):</p>
<p>Use a web browser and go to:   https://new.reddit.com/message/messages/</p>
<p>It's critical to use 'new.' rather than just 'www.' or 'old.' so that the "permalink" feature on the message(s) is available, so that that link can be pasted into the report form.</p>
<p>Find the offensive message and capture the "permalink" - there should be about half a dozen features under each message, "permalink" being one of them.  In android, it's captured with long click and select "copy link", in windows it's like r-click and select "copy link", so do whatever you need to do in your web browser to copy the "permalink" into the clipboard.</p>
<p>With that link in the clipboard, open a new tab and go to:  https://reddit.com/report  I think you can follow this link and get to the right place.</p>
<p>Select the choices "I want to report spam or abuse", "this is abusive or harassing", "it's targeted harassment", "At me", and then paste the link in the spot for link.  I don't see any need for "additional information", but you do you.  Just keep in mind you'd be taking up a person's time to read that and we're the good guys here.</p>
<p>This is long to describe, but it's pretty quick and easy to do.</p>
<p>You'll get a "Help Center Report" message confirmation.  That's how you know for sure it went to reddit administration, and definitely not back to the perpetrating sub.</p>
<p>But please don't make another post here about it.  There's been a whole fucking lot of them already.  We know already.</p>
