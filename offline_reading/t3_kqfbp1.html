    <strong>This was NEVER about saving lives (long read)</strong>
    <p><p>(UK perspective)</p>
<p>If you still think this is about "saving lives" then I'm afraid you're deluded. If the government wanted to save lives, they'd plunge all the furlough money into protecting the NHS and ensuring it can adequately cope with the influx of winter patients. The hospitals are overwhelmed EVERY winter. </p>
<p><strong>Sources for NHS being overwhelmed every winter:</strong></p>

<p>This, I believe is about top-down authoritarian control in line with the UN's Agenda 30. You don't lockdown healthy people. Call it a conspiracy and you can tell me to take off my tin foil hat. (rich from those with a fucking face mask over their mouths!) But, the information is there for you to see, on official websites. Read between the lines.</p>

<p>Amazon should not be allowed to sell non-essential items, McDonalds &amp; KFC shouldn't be allowed to trade as they're contributing to the health crisis this country faces. Corporate companies and marketing strategies are complicit in the reasoning as to why the UK is struggling with this virus. We're unfit, we're unhealthy. This isn't about saving lives. If it was, the NHS wouldn't be overwhelmed EVERY single winter. Imagine the type of NHS system we'd have if the furlough money was plunged into it instead of forcing healthy people into hibernation every few months. </p>
<p>We need to come to a decision. Do we want to save those with underlining health conditions from COVID and risk our liberties being taken or do we take back our freedom and pay with more death? This pandemic sets a precedent for the future. The government can enforce whatever it likes, whenever it likes via strong social media and mainstream media publication propaganda in the name of anything it deems fit. If the virus was that bad, we'd all be hibernating anyway. We wouldn't need government intervention. We sacrificed life for freedom over the course of 2 world wars. This is no different! </p>
<p>The corporate companies with mass amounts of influence and power over our media publications are pushing for lockdowns. Why? Because they're making billions on the back of everyone's misery.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/19/ten-billionaires-reap-400bn-boost-to-wealth-during-pandemic">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/19/ten-billionaires-reap-400bn-boost-to-wealth-during-pandemic</a></p>
<p>Amazon's Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post which conveniently is a pro lockdown publication.</p>
<p><strong>Who controls the money?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUhJTxK5mA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQUhJTxK5mA</a></p>
<p>But, these opinions aren't allowed. You're censored for dissenting. Elites are pulling the strings and they don't care whether your grandma lives or dies.. If we cared so much about saving lives,, then we'd have no homeless on the streets. </p>
<p>My belief is this is one large psyop. Consume less, accept less in the name of climate change.</p>

        <p>Pretty naive of those to think that the government, that caused this whole mess, is the solution to Covid. </p>
<p>Food banks, charities, churches and regular people are doing more to help one another than the entire government is.</p>

        <p>RE: your closing statements - I think climate change may be more of a motive whereas social control is the is the immediate objective.  With social control in hand the powers that be, in any country, can exact this newly taken control to affect a number of causes.  Whether that be climate change, politics, poverty, redistribution of wealth, gun control, education, healthcare, etc... this new power can be used to affect control of every facet of our lives.  </p>

<p>This is why I was opposed to the lockdowns back in March when they first happened, when most people refused to believe it would last longer than two weeks. Fools.</p>

        <p>Yep. News in Canada had mentioned something about how the number dying from climate change was almost as much as those who had died from covid at some point in November I believe. Are they going to do anything productive like ensuring products actually have to have a longer useful life? Are we going to stop shipping raw materials half way around the world to have them shipped back around the world? Nope</p>

        <p>&rt; contributing to the health crisis this country faces</p>
<p>Agreed. 85,000 type 2 diabetes related deaths in 2019 in America. This is a deadly disease you can literally cure by eating less sugar and moving a bit more. If you include slightly less direct causal links, other diseases related to metabolic syndrome leaves us with millions of deaths a year (heart disease, stroke, cancer, and on and on). <em>Not a fucking peep from people in power</em>. They don't give a fuck about you. </p>
<p>Queue the shills: "YOU CAN'T CATCH OBESITY LIKE A VIRUS IDIOT!" </p>
<p>For one thing, obesity is normalized in a culture in <em>exactly the same way</em> as mask wearing is normalized. For another thing, why are we 100% "in this together" for a contagious virus, but 0% "in this together" for getting healthy and fit? I thought saving lives was <strong>all that mattered</strong>. In fact, we are going in the <em>other</em> direction with this "fat is beautiful" crap that is now normal in our society. We have decades of data proving links between poor diets and death. We have less than a year of rushed data on covid but we are expected to dump our economy, our businesses, our mental health on a whim. Fuck that</p>
