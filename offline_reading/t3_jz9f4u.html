        <p>The 2017-18 flu season killed about the same in the UK.  Also the COVID death count in the UK is defined as any death with a positive test within 28 days.  So how many are actually COVID?</p>

        <p>How many covid deaths are not included? </p>
<p>If a covid patient dies 29 days after they aren't included. </p>
<p>Also, the 28 day thing is with reasonable presumption that covid is related, ie not a hit and run by a bus.</p>

        <p>Scientists suspect that its due to the flu not being as infectious as covid and the measures we are taking against covid actually have an impact on the R0 of the flu. </p>

        <p>Yes, the PCR isn't perfect. </p>
<p>But for example 2 weeks ago the UK was testing 200-250k and was getting 25-28k positives this week they have been testing 300k+ and getting 19-24k positives, so from that small sample set it appears that more testing does not result in more cases.</p>

        <p>The true question is "Have they dialed back the reps on those PCR test?" after numerous experts in that field said "35-40 reps is way too many!" and the whole "We are having tortoise swabs come back as positive for CoVid-19!" as Tanzania did.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t want covid. My moms at risk and I live with her, and even if she won’t die, it might fuck her lungs up. I’m still way against lockdowns and There are way too many inconsistencies happening for me to not question everything going on. I also don’t trust these rushed vaccines. Also I think the virus is real, but it’s being subverted to push agendas and enact new orwellian policies worldwide. So that’s why I’m here personally. I still wear a mask</p>

        <p>Your data is old, it is now upto 228/100,000 or 0.228% or 1/400th the population. 30% higher than it was 2 months ago, the groth of this number seems to be accelerating.</p>
<p>You know that if you ignore a problem that grows when you can manage it, the problem will become umageable. Can you not for yourself predict how this will go, same as you could predict a ball rolling down the hill.</p>
<p>The hospital system is already not able to hold the exta 0.026% (currently hospitalized) of medium term, infectious, and often critical patients on top of the normal people who use a hospital when they get hurt. 
Theses numbers may seem small to people who dont work with them and dont have a good reference for what normal is, But the have big impact on the hospital system that is run on thin margins with a JIT structure.</p>
<p>Nurse/Doctor wasnt considered a chill job where everyone had everthing they needed and everyonr worked normal shifts before this. Now hospitals are at capcity and are improvising more. Their work environment has turned more dangerous, and support from the government and public is fleeting. There just people and there is a finite amout, more and more either burn out or get sick themselves, and the hospitals arent going to get less occupied.</p>
<p>Yes, social distancing sucks. lock down sucks and we still have bills to pay(i agree small business and gigs, ect have been left out to dry), ideally we would have gov support like other counties and could have had much better out comes, but we dont so we do what we can to get by. Its not perfect but its not the worse thing thats ever happened</p>

<p>Source? C'mon man you can't make a claim without backing it up.</p>
<p>This is also hospitalizations. Even if half of them die, that's a 0.11% death rate using your numbers. That's absurdly low given the vast majority are likely to be elderly/at risk. </p>
<p>If we were more like Sweden and allowed a constant stream of infections, but kept the amounts below hospitalization capacity, we would have more herd immunity that would limit the spread of a spike. A lockdown is like a damming a river. You need to allow some through or else its going to burst and cause a lot more destruction. </p>
<p>Oh no the hospitals are over capacity...</p>
<p>https://time.com/5107984/hospitals-handling-burden-flu-patients/</p>
<p>This is a common thing that has happened before. Where were the masks and lockdowns to "flatten the curve"?</p>
<p>You're right. This isn't the worst thing that's ever happened. It's the 4th worst pandemic. [So why are we treating it like the end of the world?]</p>
<p>Every measure taken has been an overstep. None of it has been based on science, or previous experience. There is no way to justify what the Government has done.</p>

        <p>The overall cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate through the week ending November 14, 2020, was 228.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 population.
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html</p>
<p>Theres my source, i just googled "cumulative covid hospitaliztions" becuse I saw you number was from 2 months ago and wanted the current numbers, as they are more relevent to current events. Its also pretty easy to look up current hospitalizations and see that they are increasing day by day aswell.
And we dont have to "assume half die" to get an estamation of deaths, we can just look up that number too, google has it at 257k and that is just directly mesured covid deaths, if we look at how many more people died this year over last we can find another 299k deaths with 66% percent directly attributed to covid.
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6942e2.htm
This virus doesnt just kill you, even asymptomatic cases can leave you with permate or long term damage. I dont know about you but my worry isnt really death so much as the disability it probably will give me.

<p>On Sweden:
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/sweden-toughens-up-coronavirus-rules-as-infections-and-deaths-rise.html
TL;DR shits fucked
I can find other sorces too I just dont care that much.</p>
<p>And yeah the flue that year made hospitals over capcity and they had to implement other protocols to fill the need. That happed under nomal social condions, covid has done that despite the little weve done to contain it.  Covid is not the flue and attacks the body in different ways that may or may not require specilized resources the flue does not. 
And yeah its the 4th worst pandemic, good, i wouldn't want to live thought the wost one. But hey theres still time as, the virus continues to spread and people continue to ignore it.</p>

        <p>It's good habit to be able to source your claims.</p>
<p>Raw numbers are useless. Morso, are we only talking America now? If so it's only <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/">11th on the list, Under the UK, Italy, Spain, etc.</a> or we could look at more recent data where America is #26 in deaths/million last 7 days. This puts France, a country where you need to fill out paperwork to leave your home above America. </p>
<p>The actual numbers for America is 30/million last 7 days, and 778 total. </p>
<p>Percentage wise, that's fairly low. At well under 1%. </p>
<p>Long term effects can also happen from a bacterial infection from any disease that gives you pneumonia. Such as the flu or the common cold. On top of that, just studies don't follow up with any decent amount of time, and the mental effects, brain fog, sleep issues, etc are all similar to the effects of depression. A mental illness that's skyrocketing due to lockdowns. </p>
<p>People are acting as if hospitals going over capacity is a huge Tipping point. It happens regularly. There's little special equipment that WuFlu patients require, as ventilators have been scrapped due to their single digit survival rate. </p>
<p>That's not the case. This isn't an unknown phenomenon. On top of that, if you think we've done little to prevent it, how can you look at France's lockdown measures, yet higher per capita deaths this week, and think that's better in any way? There's literally no upside to lockdowns. </p>
<p>This is the 4th worst pandemic. Yet it's the only one we've decided that civil liberties don't matter. That's an issue. If we keep this insane mindset, the next time a bad flu hits and hospitals get overwhelmed, will we throw civil liberties out the window again?</p>
