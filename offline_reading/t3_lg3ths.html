    <strong>Does anyone else feel like the black sheep of their family now?</strong>
    <p><p>Im pretty outspoken in my family about regards to covid.  I follow all the guidelines we are supposed to but yet I'm still the odd one out.  If I call anything into questioning its ignored or just brushed off, no answers to be had.  </p>
<p>My family consists of smokers, over eaters, poor eaters and exercising lacking.  But im the bad person because I dont think we should be wearing masks or having restrictions.  If someone feels like they need to take any safety precautions thats up to them.  One thing I cannot truly understand, is if this whole time we have been "protecting the vulnerable" why are all these people running off to use a vaccine that they are essentially taking away from "the vulnerable". Again no one would probably have an answer for that.</p>
<p>I dont like the masks, it may sound crazy but we do not know the long term affects of prolonged mask wearing especially in kids.  From breathing stand point and just that awkward feeling of adjusting you mask by moving your jaw around.  I recall back in April I had a cousin tell me how their jaw always feels weird after wearing a mask from trying to adjust it by not using hands.  But now if I say that,  that conversation im sure is long forgotten.</p>
<p>I also like how people are allowed to determine, who they can be around in doors with no mask on.  If its someone you really like its ok, covid wont spread.  If its someone you do not care for, mask up and stay away.  Not to sound mean but,  Im guilted that im not protecting someones health.  But that person could be a smoker or obese, why is that my problem?  </p>
<p>Again I definitely in the minority across my family and friends.  But its just crazy to me how stuff is ignored.  The flu this year?? Gone!  So if covid is not the flu(like im told), then where are the flu cases?  If Cali had some of most strict lockdowns, why were their cases so high?  Everyone has just ignored the affects this will have on us in the next 5-10 years.  At some point people will be required to pay their bills</p></p>

        <p>This is by design. Cognitive dissonance, free thinkers are ridiculed while blindly accepting facts without thinking about the future is completely normal.</p>

        <p>100%.</p>
<p>I feel like I can't relate to them anymore.  I can't laugh with them.  I can't even smile with them anymore.  I can't pretend.</p>
<p>I went from the life of the party, talk with everyone, always positive and energetic, to sitting in a dark corner.</p>
<p>I feel like they no longer deserve my effort or positivity.</p>
<p>I think watching this marked change in my personality has had a devastating effect on many people who are <em>finally</em> starting to get it.  But still aren't brave enough to stick their necks our like we have.</p>
