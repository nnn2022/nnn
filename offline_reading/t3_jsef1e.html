    <strong>Remembrance Day 2020. They've taken everything from us.</strong>
    <p><p>This is probably the most painful thing I have attempted to put into words in a very, very long time. The politicians, "health" care officials, and panic-mongers who have decided to play God with our lives have literally dishonoured and debased <em>everything meaningful and dear to us</em>. For them, no shameful act is too base; no imposition too far, no hypocrisy out of bounds.</p>
<p>They took Nov 11th from me.</p>
<p>I sat at home today, alone. Before 2020, I have physically attended a November 11th ceremony every year, for over 30 years. Because our masters decided only they had the right to attend the ceremonies - so they could mug for the cameras and pontificate about sacrifices that they neither understand, comprehend, nor respect.</p>
<p>I was reduced to watching this day, so heavy with pain and meaning for me, on TV, like a shut-in, alone with my tears - thinking of those I know who were lost in Afghanistan, those who have taken their own lives because of the ghosts that haunt them, those who have died before their time due to the burdens military service placed on them. I cried for my father, who died at this time of year, and we buried (as he wanted) in his Reserve uniform.</p>
<p>God, how I cried today - both for the memory of past life events this day triggers for me, and for the shame I feel in watching us cravenly cower behind masks for a farrago, while we remember those who risked their lives to fire, bullet, shell, and shrapnel.</p>
<p>I watched the mayor of a city - a fat, sated little worm in a too-tight, expensive suit, stand before veterans and dare to make a comparison between "wearing a little bit of fabric" - the red poppy - and the wearing of "the little bit of fabric" (a mask) over one's face. And to talk about putting away "selfishness". He wasn't speaking about veterans, or freedom; he was perverting the meaning of this day for his own political ends.</p>
<p>The gorge rose in my throat as he said those words!</p>
<p>I am so ashamed. I beg the forgiveness of those who have gone before us. We are not worthy of their sacrifices.</p></p>

        <p>The people who fought and died in real wars, against real enemies, for the freedoms we took for granted, now can’t even be properly remembered because we have become a cowardice worldwide society who would rather give politicians full control over our lives than risk getting the fucking flu. It’s pathetic and disgraceful. </p>
<p>My heart goes out to you today. We’ll celebrate their lives twice as hard next year. </p>
<p>RIP SPC Neiberger.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry this was taken from you. My father is Vietnam war veteran and this day is very important too. I am embarrassed to live in a country that spends more time giving attention to 90-year-olds who died of COVID than they do to the heroes of our county.</p>

        <p>I had to watch as they compared us making sacrafices for "the greater good" to the people who actually did so in the war!</p>
<p>They fought for the freedoms we are willingly giving away in our fear. And it's pathetic. It disgusts me that people used this to support their oppressive covid measures.</p>
<p>Also, my grandma went to the memorial even though they told them not to, and there were the police patrolling it!</p>

        <p>This is how I felt about the 75th anniversary of V-E Day under full lockdown.  An absolute travesty.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry for your loss, mate. Your father knows that you thought about him today! Sometimes it can also be good to be alone in quiet with prayer. And next year I hope you can rightfully celebrate this special day again :)</p>
