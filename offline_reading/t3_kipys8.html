    <strong>I don't believe in a grand conspiracy...</strong>
    <p><p>I just think people are fucking retarded and have gotten progressively stupider and more selfish over the past couple years and this is the culmination of that. That's it. </p>
<p>With the advent of social media these dumb fucks have been given a platform to voice and spread their shitty, uninformed opinions to other mouth-breathers and create an echo chamber, which the government then responds to by enforcing more restrictions and bullshit to appease these assholes. I know I'm preaching to the choir here (yeah I note the irony) and this is obvious but I just feel so fucked off about this whole thing and need to get it off my chest.</p>
<p>These cunts don't actually care about saving the elderly or vulnerable, they just want to virtue signal and/or are too afraid to go against the current narrative. Throughout this entire "pandemic" I haven't seen a single person cough, let alone known anyone who's died. Those who have had the virus recovered.</p>
<p>As for hospitals being overcrowded and understaffed? Every year around Winter the hospitals are overcrowded, this is nothing new, and the understaffing is because as soon as a member of staff presents with a symptom for this "deadly" virus with a 99.7% survival rate (actually might be higher than that) they have to isolate. </p>
<p>The one person I know who vehemently believes this shit is as deadly as they say it is was a weak-minded shut-in before this all started anyway. The rest of my friends and family just sort of go along with it, but I'm fucking done. I have been for some time.</p></p>

        <p>They definitely want to virtue signal and they want attention.  Some guy on FB wrote something like</p>
<p>"Prayers for my family, a few of us have COVID and I think it's much worse than the media says.  We are all doing fine though."</p>
<p>He got tons of comments and likes and shit.  It's just a social.media addiction for attention. And people spread these fear mongering stories like crazy.</p>

        <p>Yep, seeing shit like that everywhere. I remember when this all started it was almost a point of pride for people to have the fucking virus. Who would guess that the "most deadly" virus in human history was spread through fucking memes?</p>

        <p>No, but social media didn't exist or wasn't as powerful as it is now. This is just cancel culture but on a global scale. What seems like every fucker is screaming and crying online over this shit, demanding restrictions and targeting anyone who doesn't conform to their rules; and that includes governments, politicians, countries, etc.</p>
<p>I think if we want this to end we have to point out the absurdity of it all, not throw around conspiracy theories. Otherwise we look like the mad ones, which is exactly what the cunts on Twitter, Facebook and Reddit want.</p>

        <p>I mostly agree with you but I think you're missing the element that most politicians will tend to favour the path that increases their power and control. That is to say they aren't just responding to what people want, if the population is split between pro and anti lockdown they'll opt to appease the pro lockdown crowd, or if the population are unsure the pols will fear monger them towards the pro lockdown position. They can then leverage it for benefits to rich businesses for either direct advantages or the prospect of campaign funding, lucrative jobs, speaking gigs, etc. It's a big part of why it looks so coordinated, there are just a lot of consistent dynamics at play.</p>

        <p>It does make sense. There are people who write about and dream up grand plans but in the end elements just get borrowed as and if they are useful to people who want power, it's not some centrally controlled cabal. Similarly various elites do coordinate to help each... openly so as they are part of the same organisations locally or globally, eg UN etc. But as soon as it is not politically, financially, or personally expedient they will go back to not caring about the recommendations from those orgs.</p>

        <p>That's a brilliant explanation, you pretty much articulated my thoughts into a coherent message, thanks! Like it would not surprise me at all if people were conspiring behind the scenes to prolong this shit for their own personal gain, I just don't think there's any nefarious plot or scheme to change life as we know it forever. At least I fucking well hope not. There's a reason I'm on this sub after all.</p>

        <p>There aren't many people who plan to do so, but they exist. The biggest problem with governments taking these insane powers is it sets the stage for a Pol Pot type to take over and do exactly that. Most of those in power in Weimer Germany weren't intending to pave the way for Hitler, but that's what they did. A figure like that may not have come along, but if people didn't accept the various emergency powers it wouldn't have gone as it did. </p>
<p>It's important to bear in mind because it is a big part of why rights have to be maintained even when there are emergencies. Yes it makes things harder, and yes most of the time there was not going to be a dystopia to follow, but you can't back out of the gulag system after the permanent state of emergency has become the new normal, at least not without a civil war.</p>

        <p>This is what people dont understand. We are lucky that people like Cuomo, Wolf, Whitmer, etc. aren't <em>that</em> evil. Don't get me wrong, they are evil, but not on the Pol Pot level of evil. But what they are doing is setting a precedent for the next guy, <em>who might be that evil</em>.</p>

        <p>I'm not so sure about that.  I cannot imagine what Whitmer would do with unbridled power- I think we would be in a much more severe lockdown than we are already.  When her unconstitutional executive orders got challenged by stand up Michigan, she just called in her cronies at DHHS to do what she couldn't do anymore..  She doesn't care about us, or the law.  She cares about power.  People that want power are never good, in my opinion.</p>

        <p>I'm glad you shared this because sensing the same regarding a grand conspiracy. This has been all amplified because 2020 has been the most connected people have been to being glued to their phones and computers 24/7 with apps and social media. Traditional media capitalized on it and perpetuated the narrative. If you look, the likes of CNN are doing active stories right now where they're actually trying to find "the next pandemic" in which they 'explore' to scare their audience and be first to break the story. Go back almost ten years ago to the H1N1 outbreak and I think Covid-19 would have nearly the same response and follow-up from the general population.</p>
<p>I initially thought it was a grand conspiracy (and make no mistake, plenty of powerful and evil people are making record profits right now and trying to change the world in their image) until I saw how elected officials changed their stories during the summer and this second wave. Initially, nearly 100% thought the plague was falling from the sky. As the summer went on though, we saw shifting at local, state, provincial levels and not necessarily with party lines, although that has played out predictably in some cases as well.</p>
<p>An example close to me is the recent lockdown announcement by our Premier Doug Ford (conservative) in Ontario. The whole province will have a lockdown for a month (Toronto has had it for several weeks and cases are staying consistent), the day after Christmas. The mayor of the city of Ottawa Jim Watson (gay and liberal for context) and leading doctor Vera Etches (city of 1 million people) publically lashed out that Ottawa doesn't need a lockdown and is seeing 30 odd new cases a day. Over the summer these two were total and complete doomers. In the fall, both of them miraculously discovered that people were destitute, without jobs, and suffering mental health problems and that lockdowns were not the answer.</p>
<p>These changes are happening because real people like you and I are speaking out in public and amongst friends. I doubt the internet will ever change but real people IRL are suffering depression, have taken to drugs and alcohol, and have little or no hope for their future. Politicians are starting to take notice and I suspect some of them want to be on the other side of history for helping 'solve covid' or at the very least not be blamed for the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>I more or less agree with you. I don't think there is some conspiracy behind this, but there certainly has been a softening of society to threats and unpleasantry - not that that is entirely a bad thing, progress in those areas can be good. But like you say, I believe this is the culmination of that as well as all of the social media and causes it has brought to the forefront over the last 15-20 years.</p>
<p>All of this cancelling and you must support the liberal ideology and whatever it values or we will come after you is stupid. Hollywood and celebs will get behind any new thing without even thinking about it, because that's how stupid they are.</p>
<p>I disagree with you on this virus not being a threat at all - it is - I have known a few to get very ill from it, on vents, etc (fortunately no deaths yet). So I won't say this is all over nothing - but the extent we have gone to for this (at least in many places) and for this long - with it likely to last at least twice as long as it already has - total overreaction.</p>
<p>Not saying don't protect the at risk - take some precautions - but shut down entire society - refuse to allow anything in person, shut down businesses. Nope.</p>

        <p>They say the hospital is understaffed and then force people to isolate if they were in contact with someone who had the virus, even if their test is negative. Wonder why, huh. They say they're overwhelmed but every year for the last I don't know how long the NHS has been struggling and yet the problem was never addressed, and now it's apparently our fault. I understand if you're scared to go against the grain because it'll cost you your job, but it makes me so angry that most people are happy to advocate for this suffering as long as it improves their image.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. It's tempting to believe this is all part of some huge plan, created by shadowy billionaires, but it's much simpler than that. At least in the US, half the "leaders" making these decisions are complete idiots who want to seem like they're doing something positive since doing nothing will earn them the ire of the media/the left. NC governor Roy Cooper is this, doubling down on stupid as it continues to fail him. El gato malo had a great thread on this here <a href="https://twitter.com/boriquagato/status/1341747602388205569">https://twitter.com/boriquagato/status/1341747602388205569</a> for why so many people fall in line. Summary: If you go against the tribal elders (Fauci, WHO) who demand (say) an unreasonable sacrifice to appease the gods, and bad things happen, even if you're right, you will be to blame for those bad things. We saw this play out when Georgia and Florida opened up, or when SD declined to lock down.</p>
<p>Probably 25% of leaders are true believer branch covidians, like Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. 10% seem to want to do right by their citizens like Kristi Noem or Rick DeSantis. The rest are split between opportunists or megalomaniacs in addition to being idiots, like Cuomo or Newsom. They and health admins like Fauci absolutely love being on TV and feeling important.</p>
<p>It's a great time to be Pfizer or a hospital administrator or Bill Gates. Klaus Schwab does indeed look and act like a Bond villain. I believe these people will seek opportunities afforded to them by the panic-demic but I do not think they have been driving it from the start.</p>

        <p>This is a reasonable take. I can mostly agree, except that I know several people who have gotten the virus. All recovered fine, but one (a man in his 60s) needed a ventilator and was in a coma. And for me it isn't about virtue signaling at all, I just find masks and distancing to be reasonable and easy precautions for me personally. I'm wearing a mask in a orthopedic office as I write this, and I just washed my hands very thoroughly. And I'm stepping outside to drink my coffee and smoke my cigarettes.</p>

        <p>You’ll wear your mask but you won’t stop smoking. You don’t see the irony in this?</p>

        <p>Well, I'm addicted. I have tried to quit, but it is exceedingly difficult and I'm not very self-disciplined.</p>
<p>It's more of a hypocrisy than an irony, I think. I also drink and do drugs, and my diet could certainly be improved.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to drastically alter my lifestyle, though. Bad as they are for my body, the substances I enjoy are currently essential to my mental health management.</p>
<p>But I've always been big on hand-washing, masks are easy for me and make sense, and the same goes for social distancing in public. </p>
<p>I've been overall decent, but have still been socializing with small groups of friends. I have traveled to see my mother (in her late 60s) twice this year for her birthday and xmas, but I did skip thanksgiving due to COVID. I have made sure to get a negative test before each visit.</p>
<p>I wouldn't expect anybody to do more than I have been. Just wear a mask and distance around strangers, and get a free test before you travel. Those seem to me to be very easy, and I think it's obvious and even commonsense that they make a positive difference.</p>
<p>It's all this conspiracy, anti-vaccine, NWO, satanic cabal, lizard people, etc., bullshit that I hate. Which is why I found OP's post to be sane and refreshing.</p>
<p>Overall, I guess I'm not so worried about getting it personally, but I think it's my personal responsibility, and good manners, to do my best to make sure I'm not part of the chain of transmission to somebody who might have a really hard time beating it.</p>
