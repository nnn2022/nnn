    <strong>We need to stop hating on people that don't agree.</strong>
    <p><p>Whenever people that don't agree with what we are talking about in this subreddit,</p>
<p>i see people, shaming them, attacking them and just being mean.</p>
<p>The truth does not need any protection, because it is the TRUTH.</p>
<p>LIES need protection because their very fundament is dysfunctional and flawed.</p>
<p>So here goes my effort into asking you guys,</p>
<p>whenever you see someone come in here talk shit or attack whatever it is that we are talking about, PLEASE DO NOT ATTACK THEM.</p>
<p>This only makes it harder for us to get TRUTH across.</p>
<p>Let's make a conscious effort into INFORMING the people that are MISINFORMED,</p>
<p>and if they don't want to listen, LEAVE them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But anyway...This is just my personal opnion, and i would love to hear your stance on this,</p>
<p>whether you agree or not, and why!</p>
<p>Remember; we are freethinkers, and freethinkers do not mindlessly attack people that are obviously misinformed. But again, just my opinion.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Much love to you all, no matter what you believe. ‚ù§</p></p>

        <p>What I see is people who don't agree come here and randomly abuse anyone they can. When asked for proof or source or anything they get upset and abuse even more. As far as I've seen people here are trying to explain and educate rather than attack.</p>
<p>Plus the most important is, the less of them, the more of us, so attacking someone doesn't really help them understand us.</p>

        <p>I'm not generalizing everyone in this sub but just expressing an open opinion. <br>
CONTEXT MATTERS.</p>
<p>They do, and if they wan't to put nightmarish thoughts in their heads because of some random people on the internet are freely expressing their thoughts they are the ones suffering the consequences.</p>
<p>We need more allies not more enemies.</p>

        <p>No. They have had over a year to engage their brains so if they come here to attack, belittle or troll they will get exactly what they bloody deserve.</p>
<p>Told to piss off and a inclusion on the block list. There's no point in arguing with zealots.</p>

        <p>I can understand why you're pissed, but the objective of the sub is to resist the new normal. We do that by gaining numbers and therefore strength. As u/Muno11 said we need more allies than enemies now. We need to convince people not to vote for medical apartheid. We are up against a multi-billion dollar ad campaign. </p>
<p>By engaging in a positive manner we can influence some. Its not all zealots that come here. If you end up getting into an argument about critical race theory, then you're being trolled or shilled and just ignore.</p>

        <p>I think you have to look at the context of their comments. I can usually tell if it‚Äôs someone just coming in here to cause issues or if it‚Äôs someone who has just been fed a lot of media talking points. </p>
<p>With the latter type person, I‚Äôve actually had conversations that were substantive, some were surprised by the covid data in context and stated it gave them something to think about. Granted, these people are few and far between. Most people come here to ridicule and have no interest in facts/statistics that challenge their established mindset. But, that‚Äôs true for a lot of things in life.</p>

        <p>It depends on their approach. If someone is like ‚ÄúI legitimately don‚Äôt understand your perspective and I have questions‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI got the vaccine but I respect your decision not to‚Äù, of course I won‚Äôt be an asshole‚Ä¶ but people who just come here to troll are gonna get the verbal smack down.

        <p>I disagree with the views of this sub, and i have been browsing for a short while looking for any kind of proof. </p>
<p>First, I agree with choosing not to get the vaccine, but why is the belief here that the pandemic is some big conspiracy? What do "they" have to gain? Why isn't it just a run of the mill pandemic or major disease outbreak that we get every 100 years?</p>

        <p>Well the most logical narrative right now is That the wuhan lab in china is responsible for the leak, and Dr.Fauci along with the ‚Äúscientific community‚Äù are trying to cover it up as well as they can because they have huge fear of losing their funding from the United States. (The lab in wuhan is also funded by the us.)</p>
<p>So now they‚Äôre lying their teeth out hoping that people don‚Äôt question their ‚Äúscience‚Äù or authority.</p>
<p>And also the W.H.O and Bill Gates have repeatedly talked about how we need population control and how there are too many people on the planet to maintain a healthy relationship with nature.</p>
<p>And I need to add; The World economic forum Also believes we need population control and They are actively buying family houses in the us paying 20-50% above asking Prices to prepare for </p>
<p>‚ÄúTHE GREAT RESET‚Äù</p>
<p>Where you will own nothing and be happy.</p>
<p>(This is their words by the way)</p>
<p>Power, population control and money.</p>

        <p>I don't doubt the ultra rich and their greed for power and control, but how much more control and power do they need, really? It makes no sense for them to be part of an intentional pandemic that has damaged the economy quite severely.   </p>
<p>The Scientific community aren't all one voice, they're a bunch of different individual scientists, with their own goals, beliefs, and ideals. Either they're all in on it, which seems ridiculous considering a lot of them find it enjoyable to poke holes in other scientists findings, or they're all agreeing that a sucky virus came from some undercooked bat soup, which it may have, but the majority of scientists, even the ones that study viruses, haven't had a chance to study it all that much.   </p>
<p>The WHO saying that the population needs to be controlled doesn't mean they're planning on genocide. That's quite a jump. A few more people milling about the streets isn't so important that clandestine secretive genocide is the go to option for the World Health Organisation, then why haven't they gone to such extremes on any of their other views?   </p>
<p>The world economic forum is talking about a "Great reset" of the economy, and the way we handle future pandemics, as far as I know. Which sounds spooky, but is actually a good thing, provided they do it correctly.   </p>
<p>In summary, The rich have all the power and all the money already, they aren't worried about either, I can assure you. The WHO are very unlikely to even think about a genocide via virus, let alone attempt one. And the scientific community are a diverse group of nerds.   </p>
<p>You are right to be suspicious of the rich and powerful though, just more about how they abuse that power, rather than trying to gather more; Nestle for example, they are a horrible organisation with proven atrocities committed in the name of money. Bill gates has profited off of slave labour almost certainly. And don't get me started on Jeff "The baldie" Bezos.   </p>
<p>As monstrous as these people are, they're just people at the end of the day. This pandemic has probably only affected the one thing they care about: Their profit margin.</p>
