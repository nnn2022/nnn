<p>Health is an individual matter and something that many hold dear. “Public health” is a manipulatively named term that is meant to pull at your heartstrings. It is the most vile imposition upon the lives of you and your loved ones couched in the most gentle and manipulative terms. That alone should tell you enough to distrust anyone pitching you on a public health solution: they have either been fooled or are trying to fool you. Either way anyone pitching a public health mandate does not deserve your trust.</p>

<li>
<p>I encourage all people to fight the imposition of public health in their lives </p>

<p>I did this at my Dentist Teeth Cleaning Appt,  since this SCAMdemic began. </p>
<p>I told them am not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>The notion that I'd wear a mask to walk in to the office then take it off to have my teeth cleaned is idiocy. </p>
<p>Since I pay out-of-pocket and had been using that service for almost a decade they usher me in and out through the back entrance. Which I prefer since parking is at the rear of the building and I don't have to walk around through the mall</p>
