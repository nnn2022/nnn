    <strong>PSA: r/nonewnormal users are being indiscriminately restricted when posting outside of this sub by admins now.</strong>
    <p><p>It's not just the mods conspiring against us.  The admins have become more public-facing in their role in this as well.  I recently made a post about the unusual shadowbanning activity I was getting reports of and then saw myself but there is something new happening that was first reported to me via modmail and I later experienced it myself when I made a handful of comments on a few other subs.</p>
<p>What I experienced is that on my approximate third or 4th comment attempt in what I'm guessing is perhaps a 10-15 minute timer, I now see this janky little message pop up telling me I have to wait until the timer elapses.  <a href="https://tinyimg.io/i/sdg6Yrj.PNG">Here is what it looks like.</a></p>
<p>Getting harassed by Reddit users at large was one thing but now that these activist admins are not only looking the other way when there is flagrant violations the Reddit content policy with these opposition subs like r/nonewnormalban and the like as well as the many specific abuses such as an almost complete lack of enforcement of report abuse or punishment of the users who came to the sub only to harass, belittle and discredit us.</p>
<p>I have cancelled my premium membership as I can no longer support this company where we bring them advertising revenue while they are complicit in the ghettoization of our subreddit.</p>
<p>If this is happening to you, please post your evidence in this thread.  I do not yet know if this is exclusive to our users only or who else might be affected.  I have spoken to about a half dozen users who reached in modmail who described seeing the same thing.</p>
<p>I now realize that it was a mistake thinking that we could just be left alone to mind our own business when all of the bans by association started happening.  I now realize that when you make a compromise and accept unequal treatment this only sets up precedent for further mistreatment.</p>
<p><strong>Edit: Somebody mentioned this</strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/opgbeg/youre_doing_that_to_much_is_reddit_declaring_war/">new code might be based off of VPN use</a> <strong>so that looks like it could be the case as well.</strong>  That still doesn't explain away the blatant double standard in enforcing their own rules that we have been seeing for many months now.  I'm tired of it at this point.  If Reddit was worried about the news media and the president's dangerous rhetoric about misinformation, they would have done something about the blatant abuse of reporting functionality and the activist admins who turn a blind eye to it.</p></p>

        <p>It happened to me last week, r/justiceserved banned me, even though I've never even interacted with that sub nor have I wanted to. Just further solidifies my convictions. This second class treatment is going beyond reddit and the rhetoric is dangerous. More dangerous than me not wanting the jab.</p>

        <p>The guilt by association bans for happening for a couple months now I think at this point but this latest thing was an escalation by admins that they are no longer tolerating the conspiracy against us, they are actively and publicly now a part of it.</p>

<p>I don't have proof for this thread/subreddit, but I made this account (and others) to protect my OG reddit accounts from mod/admin abuse for engaging ideas and forums they disagree with.</p>
<p>The process of harassment and shadowbanning from outside users is usually the first sign a subreddit is going to die. Once Admins follow up with unfair action too, the fate of the sub is sealed. I'm sorry to 100,000+ members here, but this sub is most likely going to go out the window in some form of quarantine/deletion. Visit Watchredditdie to know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>More importantly, Reddit Admins do not act alone in this type of behavior. In recent years, Big Tech social media hold a meeting for problematic ideas they want to reduce/remove, and simultaneously censor across all platforms. </p>
<p>I suspect an upcoming MSM anti-vac narrative to be the pretext (read as: manufactured consent) for Big Tech to censor.</p>

        <p>That's what everyone has been saying but I was under the naive belief that as long as we kept doing speaking the truth and accommodating the admins requests we would get fair treatment in spite of our unpopularity outside of the sub.   There have only been two contacts with admins (fake vaccine passport and brigading accusations from r/coronavirus) where we promptly addressed their concerns even though the second one was bogus. </p>
<p>The trolls have been operating freely and have been the source of much of the disinformation and problematic content people complain about and instead of assisting in preventing that, they have done nothing to stop it.  There is the appearance of a tacit endorsement of this behavior that violates their own site rules that enables politically motivated harassment and interference which is what we have been accused of.</p>
<p>Why did they start allowing subreddits that are created to specifically target our community such as r/nonewnormalban which is an egregious violation of the site-wide content policy.</p>
<p>"While not every community may be for you (and you may find some unrelatable or even offensive), no community should be used as a weapon. Communities should create a sense of belonging for their members, not try to diminish it for others. "</p>

        <p>&rt; Why did they start allowing subreddits...</p>
<p>They serve two purposes. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Manufactured opinion of what is and isn't acceptable; they spread the word around of what the bad guys are supposed to look like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proxies to outright censorship. Even the most droned normies can sniff out the most outright censorship. Big Tech would love to be the only ones to freely steer conversation as they please, but if they could, they'd have no users. <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html">Unfortunately, this goes hand in hand with the fact that most of the internet is fake/inorganic activity. You're usually not dealing with genuine people/opinions, especially on charged topics.</a></p>

        <p>every act of suppression is an act of fear and desperation, you have to understand this is done by people who did not know you could die until 2020, who have never heard of cold or flu or any other disease and who are so shit scared of catching a cold they have to hide everything that reminds them or pretend its all not true</p>
<p>It must be awful to be them being so fearful of everything, especially since their golden ticket to covid safety turned out to be a forgery</p>

        <p>I think the worst part is, the users of other subs now go through your post history and call you out for contributing here</p>
<p>I had a post on another sub which kind of gained its momentum and got like 13k upvotes. A person came into the comments under the post and accused me of stealing the content from him (which I didn't). Then another guy chimed in and said: "it gets worse. OP is a regular contributor to r/nonewnormal where no one has a single braincell" and yada yada, you know the regular insults we get all the time.</p>
<p>The funniest thing was, that guy also said "OP believes that Covid is a hoax" which means he didn't even dox me right because the previous post in my post history was talking about how I contracted Covid myself and that I was recovering - so how could I believe it being a hoax if I had it myself?</p>
<p>Then everyone started a discussion under this post (which was nothing to do with Covid and was on a completely unrelated sub) about how r/nonewnormal is full of morons, which is ironic because I personally wrote a dissertation about the coronavirus back in 2016, way before these clowns even heard the term. And I know there's many of us "proper" scientists here. Even though they're all yelling: "You idiots don't even know what real research is! You just watched a YouTube video!" I can only roll my eyes but there's no point arguing with this lot.</p>

        <p>I think it's pathetic that people spend so much time obsessing over and trying to participate in a sub they are fundamentally opposed to.  This is the toxic culture that Reddit probably represents a large % of their advertising revenue from.  I'm sure the troll army will find somewhere else to consolidate their hatred.</p>
<p>The bigotry of these users is on display on a daily basis and if you think it's bad what ends up on our sub, if you could only see all of the awful stuff we have to delete and that goes directly to modmail.</p>

        <p>I’ve had this happen and it’s usually an automatic bot thing for most subs, if you get downvoted they start adding a timer, sometimes I have to wait ten minutes to reply. It’s pure cancer but it’s more to do with the moderators of that sub, not the admins. </p>
<p>Now, as for you buying reddit premium, are you fucking kidding me dude? Why would you support this shithole of a site and give them access to your name/cc info? Admins have been screwing this site over for years now this isn’t even close to new.</p>

<p>The vast majority of this website has become a propaganda outlet with all of these mods and admins being complicit even if they are just the useful idiots.  The jury is still out on which state actor is behind it but the more I look at it, the more things I see that point back to the origin story of covid itself and both the people who perpetrated as well as assisted in it's cover up.</p>

<p>I think it might happen. I was wondering why I wasn't seeing anything in my feed for a while, but apparently I was not part of the sub. I know for a fact I never unsubscribed: given this is literally the reason I set up Reddit there's no way I would have left......</p>

        <p>well what would you expect from China owned company :/ they r testing their AI bots on all of us. its scary. we got this now, then prolly they turn off the internet so we wont be able to tell how the rebellions in other countries r doing. or they will produce false media claims that the rebellion has failed. tough times. but we will prevail and beat the SH out of them anyway. human nature always wins.</p>

        <p>This is an IP or VPN issue. At least once a week for the past few months with my VPN active Reddit tells me my account has been compromised and I need to reset my password. Usually if I pick a different server or disconnect and reconnect it's fine. I will say that this is definitely something new and I think reddit might be trying to nail down the bots. Or are they trying to link you to an IP address to identify you. The world may never know.</p>

        <p>I've been banned from eight subreddits so far, and I only interacted with one of them (commented in r/covidvaccinated) prior to the bans.</p>
<p>It's weird because I ignore all but a few subreddits these days, so they're banning me from subs I've had no interaction with for a long while.</p>

        <p>Good. The battle lines are being drawn by the bigots, which means people will finally be spurred to diversify and to form coalitions. This will push more individuals to help try to swing the pendulum the other way and return to balance.</p>
<p>Probably stills needs another twenty years, though, if I'm being honest. It's always a slow process, reclaiming the culture from the bigots.</p>

        <p>The VPN makes sense, it may even be there is a 1000 limit post every hour and when you have a 100 people or 500 people sharing the same connection you can see what happens. I try my best to not feed the algorithm but good vpn's are not cheap. So I try to be as vague as I can about demographics and consumerism bullcrap that they then use to target ads at you. I also dont really believe in hiding my identity. If the government wants to show up and imprison me or deport me and then imprison me, I wont fight them. I also won't fight if they throw me in a re education camp. Push me into a corner and threaten my life and I won't just give up though. If some random pyscho wants to show up and end me, well your doing me a favor. I have no friends up here in canida, my life feels pretty much over after my work injury. I think I am ok, but I cant get a doctor to check me out so I really do not know. I am appalachian, death is not what I fear in this life. Something my ancestors proably learned with their time amongst the indians.</p>
<p>I am inclined to believe the timer is being targeted towards "undesirables" and I agree, with everything going on, the blatant brigading/harassing/banning. It does feel like the guillotine is coming down a little closer every day. I've already made my plans to bail from MSM as this was pretty much the straw in everything. Reading 98% of comments is depressing because it usually derives down to violence and hate, and its ok when its for a "good" cause. Lmao.</p>
<p>But, ive been experiencing shadow logins, since around the time biden started running for president, right before axo got the ban in conspiracy, which I should have left then because the writing was on the wall after that and then trump being banned off twitter. Trump may be an asshoe, but if the president/former is not allowed to say what he thinks, then why would we? Its a scary precedent and now we see it being used against us.</p>
<p>Then about a week ago, it would appear my username ui thing has changed. I do not know if this is a site wide design change, or if its something just affecting my account. It no longer shows my karma. Not that I really care, but I do find it strange. It started happening after I tried to warn other's about the dangers of imperfect vaccines.</p>
<p>After i post my video about my work injury, i planned on deleting my reddit accounts, I really can't take the madness anymore. People hating each other when they should be blaming the ones at the top who have engineered everything to be this way. I actually feel sorry for them, they are living in a delusional fantasy. But when the end comes, they will see the truth and their spirits will be crushed as they pass from this reality. In the end we all get what is coming to us. It's why the elite fear death so much and would do anything to cheat it.</p>

Do the world a favor - get vaccinated so we can return to normal or maybe your choice will rid the world or your gene pool. Either way works for me.</p>

<p>Nah.</p>
<p>Also your kid would probably have less of a chest cold than I did, WHEN I HAD COVID. It was a bitch little chest cold, just like you're a bitch little whiner.</p>

        <p>It's about not getting yourself seriously sick or dying AND reducing the transmission rate. Anything you can do to help yourself and others around you from getting sick is what it's all about. What kind of warped mental reality do you live in to think that the person trying to save lives is the insane one?</p>
