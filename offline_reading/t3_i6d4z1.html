        <p>just to comment on the title.</p>
<p>the link says "hundreds... "</p>
<p>the title used the link's title and also says "hundreds... "</p>
<p>if u click on it, it will say "thousands... "</p>
<p>so, given that this is a CBC dumpster fire article, did they actually call thousands hundreds, to try to create the idea, that almost no one is resisting?</p>
<p>but it turned out being to ridiculous, so they changed it later, to at least say "thousands... "?</p>
<p>now i'm asking this, because in germany, berlin the huge demonstration on the 1.august 2020 (next one 29.august 2020 even bigger probably) had mainstream media news websites say, that it was 17000 people, despite  it being 100000s.</p>
<p>so are we looking at another mainstream media move here from CBC to try to downplay the number in the resistance against the criminal traitor, pedophile governments?</p>

        <p>I really don't like the idea that this is a fight about "liberty." This has absolutely nothing to do with liberty, and to suggest that it is makes it into a discussion about rights, which quickly becomes complicated. This has nothing to do with rights. This is only about not having society and individuals intentionally destroyed by unelected financial interests in the single largest and most painfully obvious power-grab in history.</p>

        <p>It kinda is about rights also... By the way their were thousands, not hundreds like the propaganda networks lied about like usual, it was pretty big from what I heard... Like a wise man once wrote :</p>
<p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>

        <p>If you take that document seriously, even just from the quote there, you will understand that the government has no role in the distribution or generation of rights, and so asking the government for permission to have the rights back is at best silly, at worst blasphemous.</p>

        <p>God help me, I got sucked into the comments and bothered replying. I just can’t handle the misinformation some people are intent on spouting. The media has done an exceptional job at scaring people to a completely disproportionate degree, sadly.</p>

        <p>Once more, the phrase "nobody has the right to put anyone's health in jeopardy," appears. </p>
<p>Wake up all you fence-sitters. This is the argument fascists use to force obedience to literally ANYTHING. In Quebec, authorities are using it to threaten public demonstrations. Social media uses it to censor anything <strong>they</strong> consider misinformation. In many states, governors are using it to remove the right to worship.</p>
<p>Your health is not in jeopardy by any action of mine, only by your own actions. Sure, we need to care enough about one another that we be watchful of our actions around others, but that's not the kind of thing the state can legislate, order, or enforce. And before anyone asks about seat belts, my car still starts when I'm not wearing it. No highway stops drivers at on-ramps to keep out those not wearing them. No one is pulled over for not wearing one.</p>
