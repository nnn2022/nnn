        <p>I agree with most of this, especially the point about processed food but I don‚Äôt want caffeine to be outlawed, lol. </p>
<p>I think energy drinks are bad because they‚Äôre full of gross chemicals and refined sugar but I don‚Äôt really see the issue with a cup of coffee in the morning</p>

        <p>If it's good quality coffee, it isn't too bad. Drinking 5 cups a day of the stuff like a lot of people isn't good obviously because of the caffeine but I agree people should decide for themselves if they want to be healthy.</p>
<p>Though I find it amazing how the most unhealthy of people are the most anxious to get you vaccinated. The hypocrisy!</p>

        <p>True, overdoing it isn‚Äôt good lol. I used to be super addicted to caffeine and I think it made my anxiety worse, and I was tired all the time, but now I don‚Äôt even drink it every day and if I do it‚Äôs just one or two cups. I just like coffee üòÅ</p>

        <p>Yes, yes and yes.</p>
<p>There's lots of talk about the importance of vitamin d here but people may not realize that most synthetic vitamin D is shit (and from China).  Remember that vitamin D isn't quite like the other vitamins you might be more familiar with, think of it this way, the biggest difference is that you can synthesize this yourself - it's actually closer to a hormone.  I don't worry as much about an inferior water soluable vitamin C product because its used and passed quickly but I definitely worry about inferior Vitamin D products.</p>
<p>Look for natural sources of D #1 from the sun.  There are only a very few in foods naturally, everything else is "fortified" with it (steer clear).  Mackerel, salmon and herring from fish and mushrooms as well.  Steer clear of fish oils if you can, it seems like a natural and great idea but in reality it's hard to find a good product.</p>
<p>Sunscreen is BLOCKING you and your kids ability to manufacture Vitamin D!!  Please stop slathering them with it obsessively thinking that you are protecting them!!</p>
<p>Sunscreens are an easy thing that people can change in their life today.  Use physical barriers if necessary like big hats, linen shirts et cet.  If you need to be in the sun for an extended period of time and use a mineral based sunscreen that works via a physical barrier like zinc.  </p>
<p>Badger makes a great one but there are many others.  You do not want a sunscreen at all if you can help it but the mineral ones are a good choice if you need one.</p>
<p>Also, you should drink a ton of water anyway but especially in the sun to prevent and help with sunburn.</p>
<p>I know that this was a pretty bad word salad but I was in a rush and wanted to get some thoughts out of my head for people to think about and look up on their own.</p>

        <p>I agree with most of this.  I burn easily without sunscreen.  So I am stuck with it.  </p>
<p>And I had to quit caffeine because of anxiety, but would have preferred not to lol.  Also weed had to quit. (And alcohol because I just had to quit that for my health and happiness)  But now I feel pretty darn good!  I do not eat well at least half of the time though.</p>
<p>But spot on.  We need to get to the root of things, not slap a quick "fix" on it all.</p>
