    <strong>If it was a true pandemic and the risk ending on a ventilator was high, what would you answer a pro lockdown?</strong>
    <p><p>Pro lockdown ask these questions all the time. They ask "WYR follow social distancing, mask, lockdown etc. rules or go on a ventilator?" all the time. Some also says "if it was a very high chance, what would you do then?" Not all mentions deaths. Some only talk about the discomfort of being on a ventilator. I'm wondering what you would answer them.</p>
<p>Would you just live normally although it was a true pandemic and risk going on a ventilator or die? Would you take precautions? Would you go for a "don't do medical intervention"?</p>
<p>What would be a good answer? Assuming they won't stop repeating their questions and you had to answer their hypothetical scenarios.</p></p>

        <p>If this was truely as deadly as Bill leads us to believe, we wouldn't need lockdowns. People would naturally take draconian precautions themselves to protect themselves. People are seeing that most people walk away with the sniffles and loss of smell for 3 days.</p>

        <p>If I was very vulnerable or it was a more severe disease like Ebola, 1918 flu and the plague I would also naturally be more careful than I would now.</p>
<p>At the same time I see the dilemma of life quality vs life quantity. Although it would be nice to live longer, living a restrictive lifestyle can lead to depression. So, I can see both arguments on precaution and partying.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Quality vs quantity. It dosent matter how long you live if your life is hollow and miserable. With these lockdowns that's exactly what life is right now, miserable. That's why suicide is up 300% in some places. If it wasn't for my faith, knowing that I would go to hell if I did, I would have committed suicide back in November. Just saying f you to the rules and seeing family for the holidays was enough to make life bearable again. Every time I see on reddit about a scientist saying this hell on earth is the new normal, that social distancing and masks will be forever I have a panic attack. Even if I dont take my own life I dont see myself surviving this much longer. My health will just give out on me. I already have little to no appetite most days.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. And we all have the right to make these choices for yourself. If someone is scared, I have no problem if they choose to stay home and quarantine for the next 30 years. On the contrary, I have no issue if someone with a laundry list of comorbidities attends a party with 50 other people.</p>

        <p>So how come there isn't scary amounts of death in 3rd world countries vs 1st world countries? They don't have hospitals, ventilators, doctors, medical equipment or any of that shit in 3rd world countries. If you get sick, you're on your own. Look up the death rates of the 3rd world countries and compare them with USA, Canada, Britain, etc... It makes no sense whatsoever.</p>

        <p>They didn't have any of these things for most of history. Think about it, things like the Black Death were able to happen in part because of lesser sanitation standards and less access to clean, running water. Lots of things were huge risks back in the day. Childbearing for example. It was dangerous in so many ways and even if both mother and child made it children often died from things that are easily treatable now.</p>

        <p>I was on a ventilator years ago, because I was young and had tried to kill myself.  I’m more afraid of my mental health relapsing than I am catching and/or dying from the virus.  </p>
<p>No one is guaranteed tomorrow.  We could die from a plethora of things at anytime.  Our bodies have an expiration date.  That’s not a conspiracy theory, that’s just reality!  And that’s not going to change when covid is off our radar.  People need to accept their mortality and live a life as full as they can.  </p>

        <p>I can see your point. I've been on the fence if I would take many precautions or just YOLO it if a true pandemic happened.</p>
<p>I had a suicide attempt when I was 14 because of "teenage problems", but no more gtempts than that. I also find well being and life quality important. I can understand the life quality vs quantity argument. Now I'm 20.</p>
<p>Can you remember what it was like being on a ventilator?</p>

        <p>I was in a medically-induced coma, so not much.  Shortly after I came to, they removed it - which was a very uncomfortable process, even when you’re drugged up.  I had to have surgery on my throat later because when I was initially intubated by paramedics they did some damage and I couldn’t talk properly for awhile.  It’s all good now though.</p>
<p>Understanding life quality vs quantity at your age already is amazing - many never come to understand that.  I’ve pushed myself to experience/do a lot of interesting things in life.  I won’t make history books, but at least if I die tomorrow I can say it’s been a life well lived.  That’s why being locked down feels like a waste of such valuable time - there’s still so many things out there I want to experience.</p>

        <p>I think about life quality a lot as a 20 y/o. Lockdown learns you a lot on how important life quality is.</p>

        <p>Maybe for the first few weeks. But I'm reasonably healthy, not overweight with no pre-existing conditions. I think at some point I would love my life as normal since I hate the idea of staying inside constantly. I tend not to follow the crowd when it comes to these sorts of things.</p>

        <p>No.  If this illness was truly at that level, there would be no public political gatherings either.  There would no sports at all.  Nothing.  The world would truly have stopped moving.  Instead, we see a pick and choose, arbitrarily, display of power and control.</p>
<p>Time to come to the conclusion, OP, that we were all part of a global political movement against a US President who had officially discredited the WHO.  He called them out for their preference toward China, a communist nation.  Evidence has been somewhat obscure, until recently, with lockdown movements being lifted or relaxed, 2 days after an inauguration.  Further, if this had no been political in its root, guidance would have been very specifically aimed at protecting the most vulnerable citizens, the sickly, the elderly, so on.  Not at entertainment and civil gatherings like churches and sporting events.  This was the most recent attempt by organized governments to control the citizens and social interactions of them.</p>
