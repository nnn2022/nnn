    <strong>Is there any hope left?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m only 14. I have (hopefully) decades of my life left to live through. The prospect of the PROPER normal vanishing is terrifying. I’ve never felt so hopeless about anything. The cyber pandemic that’s due to take place in July, the SPARS pandemic... Makes me want to tie a noose just thinking about it.</p>
<p>It feels like no one is waking up. People don’t seem to realise they’re being brainwashed, and it’s terrible to look at. I’ve never been to a concert, never been outside of my continent, haven’t had a proper chance to actually live life. It sucks to think that this could be taken away from me.</p>
<p>Do we still stand a chance of returning to the old normal, however long that may take? Because if we don’t, I don’t want to create false hope for myself.</p></p>

        <p>You can't fight against the NN if you're not here. Things would have to get absolutely dire for me to consider suicide, but I understand feeling confused, worried, and borderline hopeless. Try to stay hopeful that things will turn around become they just might.</p>

        <p>what's the cyber pandemic about? I dont know what the spars one is either.</p>
<p>When I was 14 they were ramming an imminent all out nuclear war down our throats 24/7. it was truly terrifying. I even started digging a fall out shelter up the garden and putting tins of beans in there. then when i was in my 20's they were trying to scare everyone to death with Aids. You just got to try and ignore all the white noise  and try to live your life in any way you can. I've had a lot of fun in my life but I'm still up for some more and I'm not going to let these psychopaths stop me.</p>

        <p>Just start working and saving as much as you can. Buy a piece of property out of the way and turn it into a self sufficient home.</p>
<p>If you can live without a lot of amenities, you can do this fairly inexpensively. Of course, expensive is relative.</p>

        <p>The funny thing about people is they frequently say one thing while doing another. They might even think that they believe something consciously while pursuing goals completely in conflict with what they think they believe. </p>
<p>Honestly, being 14, you could move to an open state in a few years down South and live pretty normally either for college or trade school, etc. Obviously the situation is terrible but try to make the best of it so you won't have regrets down the road. Don't fall into a depression and waste your time.</p>

        <p>There is hope of course. One advice i can give to people your age is throw the smartphone in the bin and start enjoying life. Right now we are being bombarded with fear everywhere on phones, social media etc. Throw that thing away and enjoy the birds chirping our the window and the sun shining. Find your peace and create your own world.</p>

        <p>you are young and obviously have a good head on your shoulders. keep learning and do your best to teach others. humans by nature need to be lead... obviously... be that leader and make this world what you want it to be.</p>

<p>just remember there is trained and untrained. and prepared and unprepared. be trained and prepared.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>you are young in some very interesting times. fortunately for you things are going to get much more interesting, to say the least.  also remember to keep the fear out of your heart. fear is the real virus.</p>
