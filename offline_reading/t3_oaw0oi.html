&rt; Abstract:
&rt; 
&rt; COVID-19 has been a major crisis worldwide with severe repercussions from the pandemic itself, the impact on health systems (especially for vulnerable countries) as well as the measures taken to handle the pandemic. This has resulted in an unnecessary surplus of excess deaths with severe damage on all aspects of health (including mental health) and societal well-being. The lecture of Prof. Ioannidis will focus on what we have learned about the epidemiology of COVID-19, with emphasis on its extreme risk stratification, the debates about the infection fatality rate and the extent of population spread of the infection, the need to protect vulnerable populations and settings, and the poor evidence base for most of the horizontal measures taken. The lecture will also evaluate the current status and prospects of ending the pandemic and entering an endemic phase, given the widespread distribution of the virus and the advent of effective vaccines.</p>
