    <strong>Covid 1984 is can only be understood as part of the crisis of degenerate liberalism</strong>
    <p><p>Globalism, progressivism, the anglozionist central banking power elite, western degeneracy and the new world totalitarian order all come hand in hand. To talk about one from the other is impossible, and in totality they constitute the <strong>crisis of degenerate liberalism</strong> in the ongoing death of the west.  Who has ruled us for the past century? Predatory capitalist globalism, now represented in it's highly attended form as the so-called "neoliberal" parties of the left and right</p>
<hr>
<p>What brought us to the New World Order's decision to manufacture the covid crisis? The rise of white populism and consequent destabilization</p>
<p>What caused the rise of white populism? The economic devastation of Globalism and culture wars downstream from the great replacement</p>
<p>Who let this happen? The Anglozionist international central bankers</p>
<p>How did they accomplish this?  the affirmative action progressive overclass, the promotion of infertile degeneracy, nihilist atheism, open borders mass migration, nepotistic welfare for the superrich and subversion of the press, the destruction of civil society and nationalism, the interlinking conspiracy of peers.</p>
<p>How did they accomplish this? Fiat and the central banks</p>
<p>What does it constitute in entirety? Degenerate liberalism, or the rule by international oligarchic capital under the stage-managed fiction of "democracy"</p>
<hr>
<p>What has the degenerate liberal order in Crisis done? Print imaginary money, accelerate ethnic replacement, present sham progressive tokens in the culture war, unleash the totalitarian police state</p>
<p>What will be the ultimate consequence? Hyperinflation, racial balkaniation, civil unrest, war.</p>
<hr>
<p>Look at all the failures, the avarice and greed which brought us here. Every factor which caused the implementation of the scamdemic is downstream from social displacement, in turn downstream from degeneracy stemming from the rule of international capital. Every policy response is itself a consequence and intensification of this degenerate liberalism which can only spark violence, suffering and war.</p>
<p>This decade of covid and it's consequences stemming all the way back to 2016 and earlier is quite simply, the crisis of the consequences of degenerate liberalism.</p></p>

        <p>Covid is a means to an end it seems. What is coming out of this false pandemic will be much worse than just some strain of the flu. </p>
<p>We are seeing post modernism being woven into policies and written into law. I was born in in the 80s and it least know this shit isnâ€™t normal, but people are swallowing this nonsense up without any sort of objection to it.</p>
