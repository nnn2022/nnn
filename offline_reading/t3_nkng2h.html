    <strong>An example of one of the most illogical conversations I’ve ever had with someone about what’s going on.</strong>
    <p><p>Been lurking for a while but I’ve posted several times recently to ask about your guys opinions on what’s been happening lately With this whole pandemic fiasco </p>
<p>I’ve come to the conclusion that You cannot reason with those driven by fear and emotion. They’re either incapable or don’t want to engage in a logical discussion. I’ll give one example of many conversations I’ve had with people :</p>
<p>Me : *sends CDC stats showing death and recovery rate per age group.</p>
<p>Him : well if you ask me 25k deaths in Canada is a lot of people.</p>
<p>Me : did you know or even care that 70k people died of heart issues in 2019.</p>
<p>Him : well who cares about them they are all fat and unhealthy people anyways.</p>
<p>Me : so only the death of certain people matter to you? Did you know 80% of covid deaths were obese people</p>
<p>Him: wow since you know so much facts why don’t you start a YouTube channel. Lets see how far you get.</p>
<p>Me : so I give you facts and you respond emotionally and illogically?</p>
<p>*end of conversation </p>
<p>Please tell me my interactions arent anything new and that these people actually exist. this is beyond the level of ignorance and unwillingness to accept factual evidence I thought was possible. </p>
<p>And I think that it is an absolute waste of time to even engage someone that never wanted to accept facts in the first place. Even though this was a friend I really feel for those of you that have to deal with this from immediate family.</p>
<p>Honestly i don’t even care wtf they think at this point I’m just hoping that vaccine passports don’t become mandatory here in Canada because as things stand we are being actively divided (segregated) into a 2 tier system. And the pressure of being “different” is mounting from friends and family as the msm propaganda continues to be relentless.</p>
<p>Edit: I should clarify that interaction was with a close friend. Not a Reddit bot/shill. Someone who I used to think was intelligent</p></p>

        <p>Was having an argument with a professional for "conspiracy theories". The things said were so absurd I had to ask a friend to confirm me that this conversation actually happend and I wasnt on heroin living in a dream world for the past year.</p>
<p>Its like Im living in a different dimension. Some cant even comprehend that basic rights have been revoked. You literally get told that this wouldnt be the case...</p>
<p>I mean I wouldnt mind a conversation of its rightfulness if we were actually having a dangerous pandemic. But, some even flat out deny that we even abandoned basic rights.</p>

        <p>Yeah I feel you man. One of my friends flat out said “why do you keep bringing this up we already took the vaccine. Move on”  and another one said “you’re  living in constant fear of the government and big pharma”</p>

        <p>I've yet to see a good counter argument on this sub or in real life. Everything is always the same "Wow, you people are so stupid, I can't believe how stupid you are", " I can't believe how selfish you are, how can you not care about saving <em>lives</em>" and my personal favorite doomer response to anyone making a solid argument: "bUt tHat's NoT the PoInt...."</p>

        <p>The dialogue doesn’t matter they just want to be right. They won’t ever accept otherwise or they’ll question everything else they believe in and if everything else they believe in is questionable then they begin to doubt their very point in existing, their worth and doubt their mental image of themselves. </p>
<p>They is everyone. Everyone does this. Ignorance is bliss.</p>

        <p>I personally don’t feed trolls simply because I am not here to hold anyone’s hand and explain to them what’s going on- they can use their brains and start figuring it out like the rest of us did.</p>
<p>And also, there are people who Genuinely get a kick out of seeing internet strangers get worked up. They love seeing you engage in a heated debate while they sit there and honestly don’t even care about the topic that they are baiting.</p>

        <p>I think you can be concerned that some people die prematurely from preventable causes even if other people die in other ways at different times.</p>
<p>Plus there are many times as many people who develop chronic quality of life issues as those who die from the virus.</p>
