<p>\^\^\^ Because this sub isn't about being pro or anti <em>anything</em>, it's about respecting the freedom <em>everyone</em> has to think for themselves and come to their own conclusions. Those who reject everything they are told are no different from those who accept everything they are told.</p>

        <p>SS,. So have you seen the articles in the last few days suggesting that one in 3 people will die form a future covid variant,. What if it's due to ADE in the vaccinated ? </p>
<p>That all the covid cases till now have been false positives from the fraudulent PCR tests </p>
<p>And as soon as the world is sufficiently vaccinated they release the virus?</p>

        <p>It's not a conspiracy theory, its backed up by decades of research and dozens of peer reviewed papers.</p>
<p>"COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID-19 disease via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). This risk is sufficiently obscured in clinical trial protocols and consent forms for ongoing COVID-19 vaccine trials that adequate patient comprehension of this risk is unlikely to occur, obviating truly informed consent by subjects in these trials."</p>

        <p>Except a) if the covid vaccine caused ADE, people who then got covid would have more severe cases - which isn't happening, and b) none of your studies actually say it causes ADE.</p>
<p>Your first study you mention doesn't even mention ADE as being seen and valid, just that it is a possibility, and that it should be talked about in the informed consent of giving of vaccine - all of which is possible with any virus.</p>
<p>Per your other links, 
1) "This immune backfiring, or so-called immune enhancement, may manifest in different ways such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)... Some researchers argue that although ADE has received the most attention to date, it is less likely than the other immune enhancement pathways to cause a dysregulated response to COVID-19, given what is known about the epidemiology of the virus and its behavior in the human body. “There is the potential for ADE, but the bigger problem is probably Th2 immunopathology,”.</p>
<p>2) "This deleterious effect does not appear to be an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), since passive transfer was unable to replicate the immunopathology".</p>
<p>3) "ADE has been observed with dengue virus2, Zika virus3, Ebola virus4 and, importantly in the context of COVID-19, coronaviruses (CoVs)" - but NOT explicitly in COVID-19.</p>
<p>4) Lists the POSSIBILITY of ADE occurring in covid patients, then lists all of the other diseases where ADE has been found - like flu - but doesn't expressly point to covid 19 - "Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines appear to be providing protection with high antibody titers; the possibility of ADE risks associated with waning titers of antibodies over time remains unknown."</p>
<p>5) "In conclusion, the clinical, virological, and pathological findings presented in this study revealed no exacerbation of infection in the rhesus macaques immunized with the inactivated SARS-CoV Z-1 vaccine following challenge with SARS-CoV NS-1. Therefore, these results preliminarily indicated that low levels of antibodies induced by the inactivated SARS-CoV Z-1 vaccine may not induce ADE in rhesus macaques, and the vaccine could be a good candidate for clinical trials."</p>
<p>6) "In summary, while innate immune responses could be caused by vaccination, uncontrolled immune responses and ADE are much more probable upon transfusion of hyperimmune globulin.... Although it is too early to accept or reject the hypothesis and clinical relevance of ADE in SARS-CoV-2, actual research in clinical diagnosis and vaccine and therapy development needs to consider such possibility". </p>
<p>None of these studies explicitly say ADE has been observed, just that it is something to look out for - which is NOTHING NEW. The potential for ADE occurs in a lot of viruses.</p>

        <p>Sorry did not mean to scare you, I could be wrong, enjoy your vaccine bro</p>
<p>Every study about coronavirus and ADE I have ever read the vaccines work great at first, everyone thinks "they did it" then around 8 months later the animals are intentionally infected with the wild virus and they all die or have serious lung pathology.</p>
<p>There are likely a couple thousand humans on earth who took the vaccine more than 8 months ago, outside of the trials of course.</p>
<p>It would be nice if the vaccine trials actually were scientific studies and kept a control group, but we are dealing with insane sociopaths and they couldn't have a control group possibly tipping anyone off to fast.</p>
<p>If you look around right now, the vast majority of people reporting feeling sick and testing positive are Vaccinated?</p>
<p>Coincidence?</p>
<p>We will see, I've got a lot of popcorn and am ready to watch the show.</p>

        <p>You didn't scare me, because I understand science - if anything it sounds like you're the one who is scared.
Every study you pointed out shows no definitive evidence of covid and ADE.
If you look around and see people who are vaccinated getting sick, you're forgetting all sorts of scientific FACTS.
1) Vaccines don't prevent illness. They never have, and they never will. Pick a vaccine, any vaccine, and you will see this is true.
2) OF COURSE vaccinated people will continue to get sick - with a virus that mutates at the rate that covid does, not only is it plausible, it is inevitable. 
3) The reason that other diseases like polio have been eradicated is largely due to a population that valued life-saving and preventative measures like vaccines. These diseases would still be rampant without vaccines.
4) NO ONE HAS EVER SAID THAT VACCINES ARE MAGIC. For some reason people like you think this is how science and medicine work - they do not. There is absolutely no medicine that is 100% effective for 100% of people. For you to imply that the vaccine is trash or ineffective because of this just shows a complete lack of understanding of basic science, and complete disregard for any actual science.</p>
<p>The fact that you can even joke that this whole situation is "a show" just further proves your lack of empathy or civic responsibility. Get your popcorn, but get your vaccine first.</p>
