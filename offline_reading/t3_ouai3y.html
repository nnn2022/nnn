    <strong>Is anyone else learning about where their moral hard line is in wake of these vaccine passports and forced vaccines? A hill they would literally die on.</strong>
    <p><p>I don't know how else to put it, I remember last year when we got all the original mask mandates and social distancing, I HATED that shit and told everyone how stupid it was but to some degree I still wore a mask (most of the time but not always), it wasn't something I was willing to die fighting over. However now with the ideas being floated of forced vaccinations or passports I've come to terms with dying on this hill/</p>
<p>It's a weird sense of calm I've felt over it this past week or two where before I only felt a tremendous sense of stress and anxiety, it's something I haven't felt in a very long time. I figure if I lose my job I'll figure something else out, if I get barred from the gym I'll make a home gym, if I can't go to restaurants I'll cook my own good shit and out of all if they try to force the vaccine on me they better kill me because I will fight tooth and nail till' my last breath to stop them.</p>
<p>Anyone else feel this way and could see themselves dying over it and being okay with that? I'm not trying to sensationalize just saying there are far worse things to die fighting over</p></p>

        <p>I’m not masking or locking down again. </p>
<p>You’re not forcing me to vaccinate. </p>
<p>You sure as hell aren’t going to muzzle my kids or even think about giving them the jab. That hill I would literally die on - stay away from my kids.</p>

        <p>I’ve been feeling the same way, especially with the “calm” of knowing that I’ll die on this hill if I have to. </p>
<p>There’s no stress because there’s acceptance; my choice has already been made. </p>
<p>Within the next few weeks I’ll be turning down an offer for my dream job because of their vaccine mandates. I’ve been in this industry for over 10 years, and I had my eye on this job since day 1. I worked really hard for it. </p>
<p>I’m not even angry that it’s been ruined for me. I am at peace.</p>

        <p>Ahh that sucks dude, I hope it works out for, with a calm demeanour and positive attitude I'm sure it will!</p>
<p>Don't know if you can swing it but if your job allows for it see if you could work from home permanently, I'm in tech and my industry at least is very open to this I believe.</p>
<p>If your denying it BECAUSE they have a mandate I totally respect and give you props too.</p>

        <p>I legitimately think there will be a black market if there is a social divide over this. I also believe there are way, WAY more people waking up now to this bullshit, and the goal is to make it appear that's not the case.</p>

        <p>You’re in the same predicament as my partner, she’s thinking about caving too if the online classes are taken away. She’s torn between that and having to give up a year of school to wait for the next year to open registration and start in a different state. I keep telling her it’s not worth it and just take the year off but I also understand how bad that late in the degree gap can look for certain fields. It all makes me so angry though.</p>

        <p>Mine too. My first born I pulled out of pre-K this year due to masks and distancing (I mean, what’s the point of paying a crazy amount of money for a kid to sit alone? We figured something else out). This summer, they have not had masks. Yay!!!! If they make them wear it this fall I will pull him. I’m so worried about development as it is after the past 18 months…he will go back to daycare where they interact and don’t look at faceless faces.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is it for me. As much as I fucking HATE masks, I’ve accepted that I might be forced into wearing one if I want to keep my job and refuse the vaccine. </p>
<p>Not only will I not take the shot, I will not support ANY business that segregates between vaxxed and unvaxxed. Today in my very own city in a red state, a restaurant announced they would only allow indoor dining for vaccinated patrons. I fully expect others to fall like dominoes. I’m seeing a bucket list band of mine in two weeks, and then I don’t care if I ever see another concert again. I’ve already accepted that I may not be allowed to fly in the near future or visit many parts of the US. I also expect there to be plenty of speakeasies and other homegrown fun to be had.

        <p>Same here.  </p>
<p>Decided last year that although masks were stupid they weren't a hill worth dying on.  ...But that the shots were a different matter entirely.  I knew that all this was coming and resigned myself to the fact that I'd be in a minority and that I'll probably end up in a COVID concentration camp.  </p>
<p>But as you say, once you're settled in your decision, you have a kind of peace about it.</p>

        <p>I'm at my moral line already. I won't have my nor my family's bodily autonomy forcibly taken from us. I won't wear masks anymore unless at a doctor where they won't give me care if I don't comply. I won't wear them in a store. I refuse to fly. I took a long road trip this summer to enjoy the time and freedom with my family while I'm still able to. I know in my heart that was the last time we'll be able to do that. I hope I will have enough intuition when the time comes to know when to flee my state and take refuge in a free state.</p>

        <p>I'm in the same boat.. </p>
<p>My fiance and I are getting married... I know he's gonna be sad we can't go on a honeymoon.. hell, I'm sad too..</p>
<p>My fiances family has laid on the pressure in their subtle (but not so subtle) ways and I don't want to put my fiance in a rough spot to have to defend a decision he himself doesn't believe in because he got the vaccine..</p>
<p>I'm afraid about not being able to find a job because we all know eventually we are gonna need it everywhere or close to everywhere and don't want to be a burden on those around me..</p>
<p>Plus many, many other pressures that I feel all the time to just get it over with and do it.</p>
<p>But I can feel it in my BONES that I would be one of the unfortunate ones who dies or becomes disabled.. never been more sure of something in my life.. </p>
<p>Plus, this goes against EVERY value, EVERY belief I have and carry close to my heart.. </p>
<p>The world's going to shit faster than speeding bullet and it seems like no one could care less, fucking depressing really..</p>
<p>What helps me get through this is knowing I have this belief.. and faith in myself to stick to this belief no matter what. I'm at peace with my decision.</p>

        <p>There are people out there that feel just like you, trust me. I feel exactly the same about being one of those who would get fucked over and no one would turn an eye in your direction. It's sad, really.</p>
<p>I'd recommend moving to a red state that has the laws against forced vaccinations, if you live in the states. Even some of the more red states like my home state, AR, is very, very cheap to live in. We don't have a law against businesses forcing it yet, but it should not be hard to get a religious exemption with how pervasive religion is here.</p>
<p>I recommend this to anyone stuck in this situation.</p>

        <p>I’m already having my convictions tested. I’m an operator at an oil refinery. I’ve been on the refinery fire department for several years. They train us as 1st responders in case of an emergency. I’m fire, rescue, medical, engine operator, marine oil spill response team, Haz-mat team. It’s my favorite part about myself. I’m proud to call myself a firefighter. The company has not enforced vaccines for MOST employees... but if you want to travel for work, you have to have it. All of our annual live fire training is offsite, in Texas. Can’t fly? Can’t train, can’t train? Can’t Keep your qualifications... can’t keep your qualifications?Can’t be on the department. </p>
<p>Went in for my monthly fire department meeting, they dropped the news. I thought about it for a minute. I said to the chief “ so it’s get the vaccine or get lost?” He said “unfortunately, that’s how it looks” so, I Stood up out of my chair, and said “ well boys, it’s been an honor” and out I went. Followed by 7 guys just like me shortly after. They are losing so many fire department members over this that it’s causing problems. They have to have a certain amount in order to operate. Our power is in our numbers..Hopefully enough of us will make the jump and they have to reverse the mandate.. but I don’t see it happening. I’ve spent countless hours, and given blood sweat and tears for that department. There is almost ZERO monetary gain from it. Just the overtime you get while you train. We make the same as everyone else hourly. It’s something you have to want to do and I walked away from it. From the thing about myself that I’m most proud of. </p>
<p>It is better to die on your feet, than to live on your knees. I stand with you on that hill</p>

        <p>I'm proud of you, and those who went with you. I wish the entire room had stood up and walked out right then. I hope many others end up doing the same, and they have to reverse this incredibly ridiculous mandate for you all. The world has lost its ever-loving mind! <br>
It's also the hill I'm willing to die on, and my brother, and many others too. I've been saying that for over a year now, as I knew this was coming. Masks were the beginning, and I said then, that it was just a test to see how easy everyone would comply. Then it would be vaccines, and then making them mandatory. No flippin' way will I ever submit. I will go down fighting like so many millions of others. Stay strong, and be proud for standing up, and fighting back.</p>

        <p>Love hearing this, OP, and the rest of you in these comments. I've had a rough few years personally, but I have a good job and hobbies I enjoy atleast. This is another hurdle of which I'm getting used to, but the calmness is unlike anything I have felt before.</p>
<p>I am serious when I say I'm not scared of dying if it comes to that. This is crossing lines that most of us wouldn't have thought possible years ago.</p>

        <p>Wearing the mask didn't bother me. But I didn't care if others did or didn't. When I had to go out somewhere, I just wanted to get my groceries or whatever and go home. Especially at the beginning, when events were still unfolding and I wasn't sure what to think of all of it. 
But I quit entirely this May or June - when stores made a policy of masks for the unvaxxed only, but weren't checking. Because that was the last piece of information I needed that proved to me asymptomatic spread was never actually an issue, since from the get-go the vaccines were not going to keep them from getting it or spreading it.
If things change, I don't really care and would put the mask back on if told to, but others can do as they feel is best. </p>
<p>The vaccine though, a whole different story. I'm not getting one, period. I don't intend to volunteer that information. And I'm done explaining to others why, not that it's anyone's business. I have my own good reasons not to. I'm with you OP, this is serious, and body autonomy is a big deal.</p>

<p>From the movie, The Fray</p>
<p>I am 21, in nursing school, luckily a private school where they most likely won’t mandate vaccines. But when it comes to getting a job, won’t take the vax. Sure I have taken all other vaccines, but I gotta get more info on this one. Long term studies. Pregnancy studies. Studies in the kids from those mothers. Etc. not only that but I don’t need it. Sure the adverse effects may be rare, but why take that risk. Covid statistically won’t kill me. If the vaccine still spreads Delta too, why bother? I am sure the vaccine is safe and all, but not a risk I need. </p>
<p>Not medical advice, just why I am not taking it based off my personal situation.</p>

        <p>My issue is that we literally can not tell if the side effects are rare because the information gathering has become so politicized nothing is objective anymore so the numbers could be way higher and we'd never know. Not to mention no one knows long term consequences, those are still such a mystery.</p>

        <p>It's not just about taking the shot or not taking the shot.  It's about medical treatments being forced on livestock.  If this is allowed to happen it sets a precedent that we are nothing more than livestock.  It means we have no *right* to make the most personal decisions about our bodies.  It's about freedom vs. slavery.  It's about democracy vs. tyranny.  I'm willing to die on this hill.  you are not alone.  I'd rather give up my life for something that matters than stay silent as this happens.  Silence = compliance.... compliance= guilt.  I'm not willing to have the blood on my hands that is sure to be shed as a result of this horrific violation of personal rights and dignity.</p>

        <p>I live in Arkansas and I assume that we'll have protection for our jobs for religious exemptions, but if we do not, I'll walk away and work a shitty job until I can sell my house and buy a cabin on a tiny piece of land in the middle of the Ozarks.</p>
<p>The thing is, I couldn't stomach or live with myself if I let someone convince me to talk something that did harm me. If I say fuck society and refuse the vaccine, things go south, and I starve, or whatever, at least I, as a man, chose that path.</p>
<p>I'd say move to WY/MT/TX/FL and maybe AR/AL eventually if you want to avoid this altogether as I believe those states have laws preventing businesses from forcing you into vaccination.</p>

        <p>Yep, pretty much. I raised my right hand to serve my country, fully aware that I might die. Now, after all that's happened over the last year and a half, I'm kind of ashamed of my country and know I wouldn't ever serve this nation of willing slaves. I'm not wearing a mask anymore, I haven't in months, and if I can't "participate in society" then fuck your society, I don't want to be a part of it. If they try to force the vaccine on me against my will they better bring a lot if people and a lot of kevlar, and make peace with their creator. This is the hill I'll die on.</p>

        <p>Do you keep getting those creepy vaccine letters from the VA too? “We need you to serve once more by getting the vaccine” ...I hope we would see serious pushback from veterans if they tried anything really crazy but I’m not convinced we would. We already had veterans volunteer organizations distributing the shots an an “emergency service.” I’m so disappointed lately, I’d never sign on that dotted line now</p>

        <p>I was shocked, and a little disgusted with that letter. I wadded it up and tossed it. They usually respect my decision every single year when they ask if I want the flu shot and I decline. They were seemingly following suit the two times I've politely declined the covid shot when asked. I was wrong. They're pushing hard, and I'm going in for a quick outpatient thing on Tues that I might get angry if asked by more than one person, or "counseled" about it by the doc.</p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking about the pilgrims recently. They got on boats which might or might not have ever made it to the new land, but it was better than staying put to suffer inevitable death. As much as I believe in standing up and fighting for what’s right (and I have been since early lockdowns here in California), at this point, my thought is that either Gavin goes or I do. When the infrastructure sees irreparable damage (economists expect October of this year), the remaining asshats who condoned this will realize how terribly they fucked up.</p>

        <p>In giving them some benefit of the doubt at first, i remained in both political and spiritual stasis, part of the anxious herd, eagerly awaiting the next order from up high. Always libertarian in principle, but rarely in practice as i grimly accepted my slavery, a culmination of my modern apathy, pissed off that i could not get back to my football, video games, social media - my matrix.</p>
<p>And slowly, they bought me to life, they raised the cost, the entry price to this 'matrix'. Before i was sleepwalking to my grave, and now i am alive and awake and starting to live and love again because this all reminded me that i must fight for these things, they were never owed to me.</p>
<p>So it's deeper than a moral hard line, its a spiritual hard line, its liberty or death, its a stand for humanity and how we define what humanity is? Whether its a socio-industrial machine that reduces us to commodities, or a thing of enduring love and beauty that is worth fighting for. I choose the latter, and what's more, i understand that fighting for my own rights is one thing, but fighting for others is what secures freedoms pre-emptively, and that is now what i wish to do.</p>
<p>So thank you global governments, for finally snapping me out of my daydream and reminding me there are things worth fighting for, i would take one day feeling this way, over an eternity in their prisons.</p>

        <p>I will not choose, ever, to take the vaccine. But I am not willing to die to avoid it. If the vaccine can kill me, then my death in "refusing" it would be pointless only really worth the arbitrary value of "honour". THAT SAID - and this is just my belief - If it is forced into you against your will, you are neither morally nor spiritually culpable.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I don't know, I still need to navigate with all the implications and consequences.</p>
<p>Currently I'm working out of my country, and my mother has a quite serious cancer, meaning I can't know how long she has before passing. It could be some years but it could also be shorter. It is the fifth time her treatment has needed adjustments.</p>
<p>I've been pretty compliant because I didn't want to be treated as some sort of offender in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Now I'm lucky that they don't enforce vaccination "yet" and I'm pretty free there, with exactly the same mask and social distancing stuff as before. No dramatic change.</p>
<p>I'm on my hill about forced vaccination still, but I know it would completely break my morale if I was declined a flight to visit my sick mother. Or even worse, if I was threatened to lose my job, + losing any kind of state aid that would help me get by while searching for another job.</p>
<p>I'm not ready to be secluded from society completely, since I've known no better all these years.</p>

Literally.
I'm waiting for a cancer diagnosis, and whilst I'm praying I'm clear, I've come to terms with the possibility of being denied treatment because I refuse to buy the poison they are selling.
If I'm gonna die, I'm doing it on my terms, not theirs

        <p>I make a great living and the company I work for just announced mandatory vaccination. This reminds me of why corporate America is evil. I feel sick to my stomach about the vaccine. I don’t want to take it. I feel like my rights are being violated and it opens up so many other evil possibilities. </p>
<p>Like what’s next? How can they force me to take something that was whipped together in a matter of months with no long term testing? I’m about to close on a new home and I need my job. I’ve cancelled and rescheduled my vax appointment 3 times. If I already had the keys to the house, I’d just let them fire me…</p>
<p>This just feels wrong and intrusive. If people want the vaccine, good for them. I don’t judge them. But I feel judged for not wanting it. The vaccinated look down on me. They are fueled by this extreme propaganda that is literally alienating people who have decided they don’t want the poke. Before you know it, non vaccinated folks will have no income, rights or freedoms.</p>

        <p>Dude, or you could just stop being a weirdo and get a vaccine that comes with low risk so you don’t get a high-risk bout of the virus. But, ok, take the hills. Lol</p>
