    <strong>Holding the politicians accountable isn’t enough</strong>
    <p><p>One of the largest problems with the public is they think merely swapping from a D to an R, or vice versa, is going to solve anything. While these fuckheads should never hold any political office again, the problem doesn’t end there. Big pharma, the media, and all the other institutions that helped propagate this need to be held accountable as well. The question is how? Lawsuits can put a dent in big pharma’s profits for introducing these onto the market before proper testing had been conducted, but what’s to stop them from doing it again? We can stop watching the media, but big tech censors the independent voices. If we are to stop this dystopian nightmare from rearing it’s ugly head again in the future, further action is required. The question is, how do we proceed from here?</p></p>
