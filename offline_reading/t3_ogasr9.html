    <strong>The idiocy of forcing people to vax in my country</strong>
    <p><p>Hello. I am from Bulgaria, and here people are not so "woke" regarding their rights - they don't always go to protest when wrong things happen.</p>
<p>There were few protests against the lockdown last year but it wasn't much.</p>
<p>In the beginning it was alright - officials were talking to  us every day that covid is very dangerous, that there would be piles of dead bodies, that we should protect the elderly. I was a student so I enjoyed staying at home and didn't think much about it. But at some point, a CUSTOMS CHECK INS were imposed on entering or leaving a city, and you needed a special occasion to be let out. It was horific - people who war coming into my town(the capital Sofia) to work wouldn't be let in, people who would go to take care of their old parents wouldn't be let out. Masks were mandatory even when you were outside in 25 degrees hot days. Later on I educated myself about that novel virus, didn't think much of it, didn't wear my mask the right way, didn't catch anything. And then, they came...</p>
<p>The vaccines were promoted as the holy grail of saving one from covid. Even though opinion polls showed that most doctors/nurses/GPs didn't believe them. </p>
<p>Some people, when interviewed why they took the vax, don't say to be healthy or to protect themselves, BUT TO MOVE FREELY.</p>
<p>And now, the ministry of "health" approved all vaccines for 12 and above children. It's horrific. The worst part is that they may make it mandatory not just for teachers, but for students like me too. I am not taking it. I will not take it. </p>
<p>They already have a plan WHEN the next covid wave comes. </p>
<p>There is one specific poster that is put everywhere in the subway - "Educate yourself. Take the vax. Hug life" - i.e. -&rt; vax is the only hope to live free.</p>
<p>Why are people not questioning the vax? How is it acceptable to let someone think in your behalf(governments and lockdowns)?</p>
<p>They already talk about Epsilon variant of covid. I want to go to school. I want to go to the shop freely. I want for this to end. "elected" officials ruined everything that could be ruined, and I just hope more and more people will get aware of this.</p></p>

        <p>Zdravei! :) Another Bulgarian here, but I live in the US.</p>
<p>I was just in Bulgaria 2 months ago for my grandma's funeral, spent a few days in Sofia and then most of the time in Plovdiv and other towns visiting family and sightseeing.</p>
<p>Almost my entire family is scared from the virus. Even though I entered the country with a negative PCR test AND negative antigen test, they didn't want to be around me. They thought I was a plague carrier. They were more scared of catching a mild virus than hugging or kissing a family member they haven't seen in 5 years. My aunt had a baby last year, and she wanted me to take a new antigen test or quarantine myself for 5 days before I met my cousin. Her baby is 1 year old and easily gets sick because she shelters that kid a lot. She doesn't do anything to help build that kid's immune system, like no walks, no playtime with other kids, nothing. My only grandma that's still alive only wanted me to stay with her for 2-3 days max, because she felt that I would put her at risk the longer I stayed with her, and because she babysits my aunt's kid and my aunt thought that I would kill her. I believe you, this virus has completely destroyed their humanity, and our media doesn't help either. The only family that wasn't scared of the virus was my family that lived in the village with their own farm. They lived healthy all their lives, eat onions and garlic everyday, and have a shot of rakia every night. They have never stepped inside a hospital, except when they had a broken bone or gave birth. So for my other family that's brainwashed, I didn't try to educate them or tell them that they're wrong, or tell them that they insulted me, because it just wasn't worth it and I was only there for a few days. No need to destroy relationships with family.</p>
<p>Plovdiv was relaxed. Everyone was packed outside in the coffee shops, lots of kids were playing everywhere, no one gave a damn about covid. All of Southern Bulgaria seemed relaxed to me. Sofia is insane, masks and brainwashed people everywhere, and they're totally fine with surrendering their freedoms.</p>
<p>Bulgarians like to act tough, but honestly, I think they're all a bunch of wimps. However, bTV said that like only 10-15% of the country is vaccinated or something like that, unless I'm wrong. So maybe Bulgarians aren't so dumb. We have Bulgarian TV at home, but I don't really watch our news, since we both know that they're run by the mafia.</p>

        <p>It was terrible watching old people on TV, saying that their grandchildren didn't hug them or stayed near them so they don't kill them. And that they accepted it as normal.</p>
<p>I feel so sorry for having to experience such things with your family, and yes, by official data, about 1,800,000 doses have been given at all, and 800,000 people completed their vaxination. </p>
<p>Luckily, MOST of my friends that are my age say that they and their families won't take it. I hope that this prevails.</p>
<p>And yeah, I would recommend not to watch BG TV, because, well, it is shit :D.</p>
<p>Best of luck to you!</p>

        <p>Hello my slavic friend. I'm from Slovakia  and they try to force us to get a shot and now started big propaganda about how is important for kids to get a shot. It is horrible and many people are so brainwashed that I can't believe it. 
Stay strong. Don't comply no matter what. School is just a school, job is just a job. This is much bigger than that.</p>

        <p>I'm not Bulgarian, but I've lived here for a while. I live in a small town in the Plovdiv region and I know maybe 5 people who've taken the vax. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;The worst part is that they may make it mandatory not just for teachers...</p>
<p>My wife is a teacher and was asked twice if she wanted it - she declined along with 90% of her colleagues. That was 6 months ago and nothing has been mentioned since then.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Why are people not questioning the vax?</p>
<p>People aren't questioning it because they've already made up their minds - they don't want it. No one trusts the government here so why would they trust a vaccine (or anything else) they promote?</p>
<p>The propaganda is real and it'll continue but in no way are the citizens being forced to vaccinate. I'm more concerned about the fucking Euro coming than covid.</p>

        <p>Yeah, sometimes MSM makes it as if almost all people want it, but oh god, GP and doctors can't give so much doses a day.</p>
<p>I hope that most of my teachers won't take is, as they are mostly old(50-60+) and they are cool as persons, and would be terrible to lose one of them. </p>
<p>I would just prepare myself with some straight forward downside facts about the vax, and will give them to anyone who tries to turn me into accepting the vax</p>

        <p>I'm also from Bulgaria and I haven't heard of the experimental vax to be mandatory. Don't worry, it won't be.</p>
<p>I don't share your sentiment. Bulgarians are pretty much awaken. Many of them don't wear any masks, I've had my mask under the chin in many malls, supermarkets and small stores, as well as in the public transport. No one cared. They go to protests, cultural events and enjoy life without really worrying about the virus.</p>
<p>I also live in Germany so I can directly make a comparison. The vast majority of Germans is so brainwashed half of them are carrying masks when alone in their cars, in the park or somewhere else. They also support the vaccine apartheid and claim further restrictions for unvaccinated people should be put in place. I had my mask under my chin once in a bus that was filled up to 1/4 of its capacity and one covidiot came and started shouting at me while trembling and his hands nervously shaking because I didn't wear the face diaper right. And while people in Bulgaria enjoy fitness, sports, cultural life and much more, those things are forbidden for the unvaxxed in Germany.</p>
<p>So there can be no comparison. Bulgaria is pretty much like a paradise in comparison to totalitarian Germany.</p>
<p>P.S. That fucking ad in the metro is so orwellian.</p>

<p>I agree! I had a layover in Frankfurt and it was like the Gestapo had made a comeback. Was selected for a random search and the agents behaved like brutes, and my covid tests had to be checked at 3 different stops in the airport. The flight attendant on the plane said something like, "When you receive dinner, please eat as quickly as possible, do not take your time, and put your mask back on immediately." I thought that was one of the most dystopian things I've ever heard in my life. After dinner, I tried to get some sleep and my mask must have slipped off my nose, and the flight attendant shook my leg and told me to put my mask back on. The plane was half empty, no one was sitting next to me, in front of me, or behind me.</p>
<p>So yeah, Bulgaria was a total paradise, minus the experience I had with my family if you read my post. Most people wore the masks below the nose, and while there were no protests or anything like that, most people just don't care, but probably scared to go up against our government.</p>

        <p>What if I told you that all your dreams and aspirations were never real? That, being a citizen in the modern world was simply something they told you? Told us all. We mistook that "reality" for an existence. We traded our humanity and dignity for trinkets and fun. We were presented with logical arguments for all of it: education, advancement and, of course, leisure. We were all so very special.</p>
<p>Until we weren't. </p>
<p>You don't need school. You need a plan to survive the next 24 months. The facade has been ripped off the wall. There's no such thing as a "modern citizen living in the 21st century". There's no such thing as personal rights, private property or justice. These are all things you have been told because you, like the rest of us, were simply born into this reality. And you, just like the rest of us, consented to all of this your whole life. Not because it produced happiness or fulfillment, but because EVERYBODY ELSE WAS DOING IT! We have all run their rat race and now that they are no longer entertained by our pointless racing about, it is time for the rats to die. My cats literally do this to their prey. I watch them. They are entertained for a time.</p>
<p>And then they eat them.</p>
<p>That's your future. How to not get eaten.</p>

        <p>OP is from Sofia, right?</p>
<p>From the other posters (didn't know we had this many Bulgarians!) in this thread, the virus/vax fanaticism seems to be a regional thing. A lot of us can relate with our own situations. I'm American: Going from state to state (say, from Texas or Florida to California) can be literally like going between two completely different countries. Or rather, leaving California or New York is like going from the USSR to Western Europe, I'm told. </p>
<p>And speaking of places like New York or California, you hear/see testimony all the time of randos, even angry mobs, accosting unmuzzled people. Propaganda really is one hell of a drug.</p>
<p>I've never been and don't have a terribly vast amount of knowledge about your country, but I'm pretty sure the people who would be perfectly cool with ratting their neighbors out to the government and having them disappeared by the KDS "for the common good" aren't a majority by any means.</p>
