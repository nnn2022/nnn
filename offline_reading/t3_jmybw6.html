        <p>No. I am not responsible for the health of others. If I get sick, I dont blame it on the person I caught whatever bug from. Because I'm not an idiot, and I understand that viruses and shit do virusy type things. The person who passed the bug onto me did not do it with intent. They were not in control of the bug they passed on. </p>
<p>Now if I am sick, I will be a responsible person just like I always have been and stay home with limited to no contact with others. But while I am well, I will carry on as I please.</p>

<p>In fact, in a paper about the flu pandemic of 1918-20, Dr. Fauci postulated - and this makes sense - that many deaths were from bacterial respiratory infections due to wearing masks. They're dirty and gross, and do nothing, according to dozens of studies, the CDC, and WHO.</p>
<p>You're not responsible for my health, and I am not responsible for yours. Risk is part of human life. I don't blame whoever gave me Covid, or swine flu when I got it, or when I have gotten flu A or colds. It just is life.</p>

        <p>So it wasn't there lungs filling up with their on fluids and them suffocating on it until they drowned and turned blue from a lack of oxygen, it was the masks? That does sound some what true at first until you take in to account that that was the 20s were their hands weren't even clean, and about the cdc and who, first I'll start off by saying masks do a lot Hong Kong actually got rid of the yearly flu by using them. Second I just checked the cdc website and have found nothing saying not to wear a mask and that they are filthy, I found the opposite accidentally, studies showing why to wear them, how to wear them, and how to clean them. I would honestly like you to find me one study from the cdc saying masks are bad and give you bacterial infections</p>

        <p>It was a paper in the NEJM some time ago. It's not hard to google. Hell, even Dr. Fauci pegged the IFR righr in February - right around influenza, 0.13-0.26% is the new IFR globally for all populations, whereas under 70 it is somewhere like 0.03-0.08%.</p>
<p>Masks are stupid. If YOU want to wear one and think it protects you like some talisman, sure. I think they could be beneficial in a sense if someone is actively sick, coughing, sneezing everywhere and has no sense of hygiene, but never before have we screamed about masking healthy individuals. Asymptomatic spread is also not a thing, according to many, many scientists and doctors, including Dr. Fauci. Masks IMO are used to blame others, as opposed to us blaming the  government for their shitty, over-wrought response in destroying the economy and human society. It's THEIR fault! Blame THEM! Not me! It is the politician's way out.</p>

        <p>The whole point of a mask is to not spread it to others if you have it, and yes asymptomatic spread is real. The way covid spreads is by water droplets that carry the virus that come at your every time you open it like when talking, breathing and coughing and sneezing, using a mask limits how far that goes. And actually Hong Kong got rid of the flu by wearing masks</p>

        <p>That research came from the cdc, and no covid is not fake go to your local hospital and see how many people are dying in negative pressured rooms in the ICU, and with a disease infecting 9 million people killing 215,000 you would think someone would say it's fake ANYBODY, and also just because you don't know anyone who got infected doesn't mean it's fake, everyone around the world knows for a fact that ebola is real even though the infections of it are lower than covid</p>

        <p>No, because I do not work in a hospital nor do I know any anyone who is infected because everyone in my family was or is a doctor or nurse and they know how to handle viruses, taking pictures would violate the patients privacy, stuff like that has actually gotten doctors fired, and no it won't out of all of reddit this is by far one of the most stubborn and hypocritical subs I've seen.

<p>Nah he didn’t. I’ll answer it for you. No quality studies have been conducted to show their efficacy and they are quite unsanitary if not changed every 2 hours and replaced with new disposable ones.</p>
<p>And no, having family members who have careers doesn’t entitle you to shit. You are free to your one opinion just like I’m free to mine.</p>

        <p>Well, having someone with a medical background telling me what to do during a global pandemic is certainly better then skepticism, and since the covid vaccine doesn't exist yet mask are one of the only things limiting the spread. The reason he didn't wear a mask last year is because he got the flu vaccine, and wearing a mask for the flu wouldn't work unless everyone does it, like Hong Kong did which again got rid of the yearly flu</p>

        <p>I do think for myself, if I came to the conclusion masks are useless, cdc and who came out and said " we don't know why we recommended masks, they are useless and do absolutely nothing to protect you or others " I would probably look at their research and stop. But the conclusion always has been that masks work. Why don't you look at florida where masks aren't mandatory, there are around 5000 infections a day, but in maryland where they are, there are only 500 a day 133 of which actually ended up in the ICU today. And when talking about the infections you have take into account population density, if you look at a map of france showing population there's a massive blob showing that paris is the most populated area of people,and as of right now france has about 53,000 infections. And actually yes my parents do know and all they said was 
"don't talk about the election"</p>

        <p>That anolgy is really shitty because I'm guessing you don't know anyone with ebola right? And also because, the amount of people you've been with the deadliest disease ever, and people you've seen with covid are none. Actually the amount of people you've seen with covid is probably higher than one, considering that some people are presymptomatic for around 2 weeks</p>

<p>But there is very little correlation between the mortality rate of a virus from 100 years ago and you seeing someone with covid, chances are unless you are at least 110 years old you've never seen anyone the spainish flu, and the main reason why so many people got it was because in ww1 everyone was packed in trenches and spread it to more people. There was no chance to put a trench in lockdown</p>

        <p>Not everyone here is against masks. I wear a mask when required, but I am skeptical of the current handling of the pandemic. That is my reason for being interested in this sub. Further reasoning below:</p>
<p>Politicians and the media seem to live by the rule "never let a good crisis go to waste". So there are people in powerful positions who are definitely going to benefit from a pandemic. I think that creates a lot of perverse incentives, and I am worried that this could cause long lasting harm to society. </p>
<p>I worry about government overreach, financial fraud, and the curtailment of our rights. I also worry about our future prosperity. Not because I am greedy for wealth, but because wealth is what keeps us healthy. When the economy shrinks, real people suffer and die. Average lifespans shorten. </p>
<p>In short, I think we should protect our elderly and our sick, but I think there is a real risk that the cure can become worse than the disease.</p>
