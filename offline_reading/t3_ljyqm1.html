    <strong>people and friends in lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>It's truly sad for an extrovert like me. Initially, after the current lockdown was announced in England, more of my friends were enthusiastic about still coming out and meeting up (they all think lockdowns are bullshit too). However, the longer this lockdown has went on for, more and more of my friends completely cut themselves off from me, and the rest our mutual friends too. </p>
<p>They won't come out at all anymore, and it's a miracle to even get a text back. It's like they sink into this massive depression, preventing them from contacting us. Or they become content with sitting on their Xbox by themselves all day long, and they don't feel the need to socialize anymore.</p>
<p>It's so widespread that my friend and I even came up with a name for it- the lockdown fever.</p>
<p>In total, there's about 2-3 other people in my town that I'm friends with that still come out to hang out on a pretty regular basis.</p>
<p>People, one by one, are drifting away from me, and it's making me depressed as fuck. Turns out not many people will sustain friendships long-term (more than a few months) if we're not regularly seeing each other from convenience (we're both out after school and it's convenient to meet up and hang out). </p>
<p>Can't even be fucked to text back, just fucking leave me on seen. </p>
<p>It truly sucks. I get so depressed being at home by myself for more than a day or so. I have technology too, yet I could never spend whole days watching shitty YouTube/Netflix. Maybe when I'm not feeling well, or if I'm on a comedown or otherwise no energy, but the second I'm back on my feet, I'll hit someone up to hang out and socialize with, without it I get crazy depressed.</p>
<p>It's not just me, people have been cutting themselves off from the friend group we have in our small town, one by one, becoming hermits, and it's so fucking sad. I'm looking forward to school, because that will force everyone into some social interaction at least, and I'll have places to be and shit to do to take my mind off this depressing ass topic.</p></p>

        <p>I hear ya man but I  think the reason your mates aren't going out isn't called 'lockdown fever' it's just called lockdown..no?.</p>
<p>Also to say, friendships don't just end like that, they'll still be your mates,.
They're gonna need you as much as you need them.
It's probably nothing personal that they've gone quiet on you ,might well be lockdown fever as you call it.
You'll be alright mate.</p>

        <p>England has some crazy rules and fines, so this makes sense. It's not like the US where we aren't policed, just shamed.</p>

        <p>Lockdown is making people into antisocial cunts, but not everyone. The coppers aren’t arsed anymore, there is no reason to stop talking to everyone. And if they don’t come out, there’s still texting, but lockdown has made some people perfectly happy to cut ties.</p>

        <p>Being an introvert with some extroverted qualities, I just want to let you know that there are people on the other side who want out of this too, and are going through the same thing.</p>
