    <strong>I'll Make It Simple, So the Doomers Can Understand...</strong>
    <p><p>If you truly care about preserving human life, as you and your ilk so often claim, then you should place roughly equal emphasis on preventing all deaths, regardless of their cause. But you don't. Instead, you narrowly fixate on one kind of death (COVID deaths) while comparatively ignoring all others. Because you don't actually care about preserving human life. You just want to be part of the group, to appear virtuous, and to feel superior to others. You and others like you are total phonies exploiting death and suffering to make yourselves look and feel better. You're sad, pathetic losers who are ruining society.  Also, kiss my ass.</p></p>

        <p>Lol.  </p>
<p>Ok now next time explain your point using this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital-acquired_infection</p>
<p>&rt;In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that roughly 1.7 million Healthcare-Associated infections, from all types of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi combined, cause or contribute to <strong>99,000 deaths each year</strong>.[3] In Europe, where hospital surveys have been conducted, the category of gram-negative infections are estimated to account for two-thirds of the 25,000 deaths each year.[4] Nosocomial infections can cause severe pneumonia and infections of the urinary tract, bloodstream and other parts of the body.[5][6] Many types display antimicrobial resistance, which can complicate treatment.</p>
<p>Antibiotics used in agriculture are the main culprit. What this means and the political ramifications are up to the reader.</p>

        <p>COVID kills far more people than the flu, and we don't have an effective treatment or a widely available vaccine, like we do with the flu.</p>
<p>Why do you think we have hospitals in the border of collapsing? Do you think the flu also kills 3k people per day in the United States?</p>

        <p>You have no idea what you are arguing about. We are not tying to stop those deaths? So the billions that go into cancer research each year don't count? The Billions of dollars and heaps of regulation on car safety don't count?
Suicide Hotlines etc, don't count. </p>
<p>Just because <em>you</em> only hear about covid doesn't mean nothing is being done on the other departments. The media unfortunately has had a field day with this covid stuff and knows people will consume anything about it.</p>
<p>You are simply ignoring that those deaths cannot be compared (specially murder, suicide and a virus, tf are u even talking about)</p>

        <p>Except there is global effort to stop all of those things you listed. Not all those efforts are perfectly executed, but the effort is there. Every nation on earth takes measures for these. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>flu death - vaccines every year</p>
<p>drug death - a huge industry of rehabilitation and treatment exists around this</p>
<p>murder - let me introduce you to police and laws and prisons.</p>
<p>suicide  - suicide hotlines, therapy, drug treatments, hospitals</p>
<p>cancer - do you even know how much money goes into cancer treatment and research?</p>
<p>aneurysm  - same as above and literally every disease and health issue ever.</p>
<p>car crash - the entire automotive industry works tirelessly to create safer vehicles, also street laws and seatbelts.</p>
<p>Welp, I guess the only point you made is that you're braindead.</p>

        <p>Flu death- this year flu deaths are at an all time low. Why? They say it’s because people are wearing masks and social distancing. So why are covid cases at an all-time-high? 1- they’re lying, 2- they don’t know how it spreads, which would also mean 3- they’re lying.</p>
<p>Drug deaths- an industry exists around keeping people addicts. Also currently a lot of support groups aren’t meeting- and other services aren’t as easily accessible right now- why? Covid.
Murder- well when you defund the police, where does that put us?</p>
<p>Suicide- helplines have never been enough, therapy is being forced to online which doesn’t help- reduces it to that of a helpline. Rated are up- why? Covid. Mostly lockdowns.</p>
<p>Cancer- do you know how many people have died having their treatment postponed because of... you guessed it! Covid.</p>
<p>Aneurysm- please note cancer.</p>

<p>You're presenting a false dilemma. Here's option 4: You're just ignorant and talking out your ass. The flu and covid don't behave exactly the same. While their mode of transmission is similar, covid peaks in viral load much more frequently and has much longer periods of transmission without symptoms leading to a much greater rate of super spreader events which are leading ways covid has been spreading.</p>
<p>&rt;Drug deaths- an industry exists around keeping people addicts. 
Yeah people do bad things for monetary gain. Do you have a point?</p>
<p>&rt;Also currently a lot of support groups aren’t meeting- and other services aren’t as easily accessible right now- why? Covid. 
Maybe not as easily accessible but many of these resources have taken to an online remote format. But this is getting away from the main point I'm making which is that all of these afflictions are globally addressed, even if imperfectly and you've done nothing to refute this.</p>
<p>&rt;Murder- well when you defund the police, where does that put us?
This is beyond irrelevant and a complete strawman. Did you think you were being clever when you typed this? If you want to talk about that topic I'd be more than happy to but that's an entirely different discussion you're trying to pivot to.</p>
<p>&rt;Suicide- helplines have never been enough, therapy is being forced to online which doesn’t help- reduces it to that of a helpline. Rated are up- why? Covid. Mostly lockdowns.
Again, even if these resources are imperfect they still exist globally to combat afflictions and problems people face, you've done nothing to refute my original claim.</p>
<p>&rt;Cancer- do you know how many people have died having their treatment postponed because of... you guessed it! Covid.
Do you? Give me some stats on that.</p>
<p>&rt;Aneurysm- please note cancer.
Same as above.</p>
<p>&rt;Car crash- still a higher death rate than covid.
Again, even if these resources are imperfect they still exist globally to combat afflictions and problems people face, you've done nothing to refute my original claim.</p>
<p>So one thing you keep bringing up is that you seem to think there is a big problem with certain aspects of our lives being impacted due to covid lockdowns, whether that be people having more issues with suicide or drugs or receiving treatment or what have you. Now obviously anyone would agree that nobody wants a rising rate of these issues. The main point of difference is that covid is seen as being a temporary problem with a foreseeable permanent solution in the form of vaccines. The use of masks and social distancing and lockdowns is intended to curb the spread of covid because of numerous worries, one being if left unchecked like you'd want, hospitals can become overwhelmed and society could become crippled much worse than the inconvenience of lockdowns and masks. Its about calculated risk similar to driving a car, every time you get in your car you're risking your life. Nobody wants to social distance or lockdown and doing so comes with certain risks and costs, but we do so in a calculated effort to mitigate the potential damage we could otherwise face.</p>

        <p>Every argument is negligent. </p>
<p>These issues shouldn’t be shafted for over a year and what will probably be longer. People think its okay to just sweep them under the rug with no plan to prevent them because of a non-existent pandemic. This os going to be around for a long time because its a glorified flu and the flu had been around many years. Vaccine or no vaccine. And anyone intelligent enough to read won’t get it. Clearly you ur leaders have very little faith in it anyways if nothing changes after you get the jab. We’re still wearing masks. If hospitals were over-run we’d see it. Instead they have time to make tiktoks and choreograph dances. I go the hospital and its empty. See videos of people in hospitals? Empty.even if they were at max cap. Its flu season. They’re usually busy around this time and they’re not.if people didn’t want this, they wouldn’t stand for it. So don’t give me that holier than thou attitude. Its all about social media publicity. People want to me like oh look at me im doing mu part im a good person. Well that is simply not the case because its out of selfishness and contempt for others. If people cared, they would have cared before. They would have worn a mask and social distanced every flu season to protect those who have weak immune systems. Instead they’ve forgotten about all the other issues they claim to care about so much to protect grandma who they’ve shoved into a nursing home and is now suffering from loneliness, and an unchanged diaper. Your attitude is disgusting and inexcusable.</p>

<p>Because you don't actually have an intelligent argument for anything I've said so you just try to handwave it all.</p>
<p>&rt;These issues shouldn’t be shafted for over a year and what will probably be longer.  People think its okay to just sweep them under the rug with no plan to prevent them because of a non-existent pandemic.</p>
<p>As a society we still address each and every single one of those issues. Only difference is it's a bit harder to now but there isn't a single issue we just totally gave up on because of lockdowns and social distancing.</p>
<p>&rt;This os going to be around for a long time because its a glorified flu and the flu had been around many years. Vaccine or no vaccine.</p>
<p>You sound very knowledgeable in this topic, you're a doctor or a research specialist I presume? Oh you're not? You're just making up random words that you like? Neat.</p>
<p>&rt;And anyone intelligent enough to read won’t get it.</p>
<p>I guess that explains why Trump got it.</p>
<p>&rt;Clearly you ur leaders have very little faith in it anyways if nothing changes after you get the jab. We’re still wearing masks.</p>
<p>You do realize the vaccine *just* came out right? We've barely started applying it. Or are you so dense you think the exact same day a vaccine exists we can snap our fingers and everything happens instantaneously? You see there's this funny little thing called "time", and most things require it.</p>
<p>&rt; If hospitals were over-run we’d see it.</p>
<p>We have seen it. You're being willfully ignorant now.</p>
<p>&rt; Instead they have time to make tiktoks and choreograph dances.</p>
<p>Oh no, god forbid some medical staff made some funny videos to try to bring spirits up when stress and uncertainty was extremely high. What monsters.</p>
<p>&rt;  I go the hospital and its empty.</p>
<p>Oh neat a totally not useless anecdote. Well here's my anecdote, I've been to a hospital and seen it overwhelmed. There, I guess our anecdotes cancel each other out. Now since our anecdotes are worthless how about we look at the actual facts and numbers regarding covid and the reality that many hospitals in highly populated regions have already been overwhelmed?</p>
<p>&rt;So don’t give me that holier than thou attitude. Its all about social media publicity. People want to me like oh look at me im doing mu part im a good person. Well that is simply not the case because its out of selfishness and contempt for others.</p>
<p>I couldn't give less of a fuck if people are doing it for social brownie points. If someone goes out and say, saves a baby from drowning, then post about it on social media and the only reason they saved the baby is because they want people to pat em on the back... then who cares? A good deed is still a good deed regardless of the motive. Nobody is purely altruistic and you're a dumbfuck if you're gonna blindly assign motive to massive swathes of the population so you can judge them.</p>
<p>&rt; If people cared, they would have cared before. They would have worn a mask and social distanced every flu season to protect those who have weak immune systems.</p>
<p>This is actually a pretty funny statement. I completely agree, we should probably wear masks more even after covid ends and practice social distancing during times like flu season, I'm glad we can agree on that.</p>
<p>&rt; Instead they’ve forgotten about all the other issues they claim to care about so much to protect grandma who they’ve shoved into a nursing home and is now suffering from loneliness, and an unchanged diaper.</p>
<p>Who are you even talking to? Just some random imaginary strawman in your head now?</p>
<p>&rt; Your attitude is disgusting and inexcusable.</p>
<p>God bless you too.</p>

        <p>Exactly. The government enforces wearing seatbelts just like it's enforcing wearing facemasks: for your protection and the people around you.</p>
<p>Literally all things  listed there have global prevention methods behind them, except aneurysms, which can't be prevented but they're definitely treated as fast as possible.</p>
<p>I still don't know what all that has to do with COVID-19. Do you think we have to choose between preventing those or preventing COVID? Do you not know we can prevent both at the same time?</p>

        <p>Seatbelts actually make sense. At least theres proof behind then that they work. If masks worked, cases in mandated areas would be far lower than non mandated areas. Instead they’re at comparable levels.
Ask our leaders this question, because it seems like they’ve chosen covid over everything else.</p>

        <p>I mean, I just did, but if you want it dissected and easy to understand, here they are:</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.20109231v5">August study, showing that weekly increases in per-capita mortality were four times lower in places where masks were the norm or recommended by the government, which completely contradicts your argument</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-020-06067-8">paper suggesting that wearing masks decrease how many viruses you get, therefore diminishing the intensity of the disease on the wearer</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768533">study showing how universal mask wearing in hospitals reduce the spread of COVID</a>. (Hospitals are public settings)</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6928e2.htm?s_cid=mm6928e2_w">report showing how wearing facemasks in a hair salon reduced the spread of the virus</a>. (Hair salons are public settings)</p>
<p>And this is just what I found with just a couple of minutes of searching. Masks do work and they do make an "overall difference when used in a public setting".</p>

        <p>Your studies suck ass and prove nothing but your confirmation bias. They are not scientific at all. Complex statistical modeling, zero control groups, phone interviews and self reported stats, 70+ people who provided no response included in the study and placed in the "wore a mask/negative" column. One of the studies doesn't even mention the kind of masks being studied. Yeah, wow, you've got yourself some real smoking guns there.</p>
<p>Do you want to know what happens when you split a large group of healthcare workers in high risk settings into control groups, ask one group to wear cloth  (surgical) masks during their shift, another group not to, and then measure their rates of laboratory confirmed respiratory infection at the end of four months?</p>
<p><strong>Disposable cloth face masks cause SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER rates of influenza and respiratory infection in healthcare workers vs. the control arm who wore NO MASKS</strong>
https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577.long
<em>"The rates of <strong>all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm</strong> ... This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and <strong>the results caution against the use of cloth masks</strong> ... Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection... as a precautionary measure, <strong>cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs</strong>, particularly in high-risk situations, and <strong>guidelines need to be updated.</strong>"</em></p>
<p>But I'm sure that your studies, like the incredibly scientific hair salon phone interview "study" are somehow superior to this one, and this is all wrong and masks work, right bud? Break it down for me junior. Pull up that <em>hamster cage study</em> while you're at it that shows masks to be 70% effective, that was a good one.</p>

        <p>Ohhhhh it's a REPORT!

        <p>So you get one link that isn't up you your standards and you just ignore the rest? I mean, did you even read the rest or just found one that you didn't like and went "yep, this is the only one that exists now"?</p>
<p>Because I did read your links. Whereas I showed studies and reports, albeit one with limited reach, you showed zero studies (showing that you don't really care about studies after all?) and instead sent me one link about how face masks can irritate the skin when worn constantly, which is true. </p>
<p>There's another article written around one tweet from a surgeon saying that masks didn't work, because we didn't have evidence that they did and surgical face masks were hard to come by for doctors. You can tell the surgeon doesn't believe that anymore if you just look at his photo right next to the tweet where HE'S WEARING A FACE MASK.</p>
<p>Then there's yet another article about a handful of people in Oklahoma including one optometrist and a single doctor saying that masks decrease oxygen but provide exactly zero proof of it. </p>
<p>Finally, there's one article talking about how some dentists correlate wearing masks with "mask mouth", which can be a problem (I'm yet to see conclusive evidence of that) but it can be <a href="https://www.colgate.com/en-us/oral-health/threats-to-dental-health/what-is-mask-mouth">easily solved with proper hygiene</a>. </p>
<p>So, to summarize, there's mask mouth, there's one doctor and one optometrist in Oklahoma saying that masks decrease oxygen, which <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters?gclid=Cj0KCQiAoab_BRCxARIsANMx4S6R1EgolzzfQrVS_pg_eaHtXib-xZ0JsKoopZcrS7vK5blih0hcl6kaAk7IEALw_wcB#oxygen">is a lie</a>, the fact that wearing face masks for prolonged times can lead to skin irritation, and an article about a tweet from someone who's wearing a face mask in his profile picture. Why are you calling face masks "dangerous" again?</p>
<p>Seriously, I would've taken a study or even a report over blog entries and dated news articles. It's laughable that you went on and on about the report I sent, yet this is your "scientific" evidence.</p>
<p>For someone making a big show about lacking scientific evidence, you failed miserably to provide any.</p>

        <p>Huh...? Those links were simply to show you that there are doctors all over the place talking about various side effects of masks. It's exactly what you asking for.

<p><em>This is a study.</em> A very scientific one.</p>
<p><strong>Disposable cloth face masks cause SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER rates of influenza and respiratory infection in healthcare workers vs. the control arm who wore NO MASKS</strong>

<p>The one <em>you</em> are now ignoring like it doesn't exist. Remember?</p>
<p>13x higher respiratory infections in the mask control arm vs no masks at all. That is extremely statistically significant. </p>
<p><em>These</em> are all studies as well.</p>

<em>"Face mask use in health care workers has not been demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds."</em> </p>
<p><strong>Surgical masks make no difference in surgical infection rates</strong>
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9013247/
<em>"Quite to the contrary, both in-vitro and in-vivo studies indicate that a mask may not be universally necessary in today's surgical environment."</em></p>
<p><strong>Disposable surgical masks make no difference in surgical infection rates, again</strong>

<em>"... it is unclear whether the wearing of surgical face masks by the surgical team either increases or reduces the risk of surgical site infection in patients undergoing clean surgery."</em></p>
<p><strong>Surgical masks show little to no efficacy towards intended purposes, yet again</strong>
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16295987/
<em>" ... it is unclear whether wearing surgical face masks results in any harm or benefit to the patient undergoing clean surgery."</em></p>
<p><strong>Face masks made no difference in viral/influenza infection rates of pilgrims over three seasons</strong>
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33048964/
<em>"... facemask use did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9 to 2.1, p = 0.18) nor against clinical respiratory infection (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.4, p = 0.40). Similarly, in a per-protocol analysis, facemask use did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections (OR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9-1.7, p = 0.26) nor against clinical respiratory infection (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.8, p = 0.06)."</em></p>
<p>And this is a meta-analysis (study of other studies) by the CDC, reviewing 70+ years of all of the available data on masks and airborne respiratory illness.</p>
<p>https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</p>
<p><em>"We did not identify any published research on the effectiveness of respiratory etiquette in reducing the risk for laboratory-confirmed influenza or ILI.</em>"</p>
<p><em>"In this review, we did not find evidence to support a protective effect of personal protective measures or environmental measures in reducing influenza transmission."</em></p>
<p><em>"In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks</em>"</p>
<p>How's that?</p>
<p>Wait, let me guess. Covid isn't influenza, right? Go ahead tell me all about how covid isn't influenza. I dare you.</p>
<p>Oh the CDC has done other meta-analysis that shows that masks actually do work? Tell me more. Drop a link to those other analysis. I know you want to. Please?</p>
<p>The floor is yours junior. Can't wait to see what batch of bullshit you come up with next!</p>

        <p>Oh boy you couldn't resist talking down to me at the end didn't you?</p>
<p>Now, I'll give you something, because I believe you made a good point. That's not sarcasm, that's a true, earnest admission. </p>
<p>That first study you posted does, in fact, state that medical face masks should be used in medical environments. I agree with that. You are right. I'll even go as far as to say that, based on the results, we can extrapolate to say that anyone wearing a face mask all day, every day, should be wearing a disposable face mask and not a cloth mask, which is what the study says.</p>
<p>As far as the rest goes, well, yeah. COVID isn't influenza. I don't know why you're acting like that's a big "gotcha" thing. We have medical treatments and vaccines for influenza, and those don't work for COVID because COVID is a different disease.</p>
<p>Now, I also should point out that you seem to be aware that meta-analysis are the best kind of scientific evidence, which is true. </p>
<p>The best one is this <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext">meta-analysis published by Lancet about COVID</a> (not influenza) that went through 172 observational studies across 16 countries and six continents, looking at well over 25 thousand people, showing how "<em>Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection</em>".</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.16.20214171v1">smaller meta-analysis</a> that found that "<em>wearing a mask was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 infection".</em> They concluded that "<em>wearing a mask could reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection</em>".</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196655320310439">another one</a> that, while admitting more studies needed to be done, still  "<em>demonstrated the protective effects of masks against COVID-19 infection on HCWs and other populations</em>".</p>
<p>I mean, the evidence is all there and it's easy to find for anyone that wants to look for it. The evidence does show that cloth masks aren't as effective or sanitary as disposable ones. I would argue that getting a respiratory illness from that we know and that we have treatments for because of face mask use is better than getting COVID, for which we still don't have an effective treatment. However, at this point that's just semantics and I don't want you to feel like I'm "moving the goalpost". </p>
<p>So yes, you are right. Cloth masks aren't as good as disposable facemasks, and medical personnel should wear the appropriate medical gear. As far as us, we should ideally wear disposable face masks, although cloth face masks are also acceptable in short periods because they only show issues when worn for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Now, do you have any meta-study (or any good study at all) that proves wearing masks is "dangerous", worse, or even just ineffective?</p>

<p>Yes. The very first study I linked, which you now seem to have completely blocked out from your consciousness lol.</p>
<p>13x higher in the group who wore cloth masks than the group who wore <em>no masks</em>. "Very statistically significant".

        <p>More people die from preventable hunger. It would cost far less to help them than to (very questionably) limit temporarily the negative effects of Covid-19. Neither countries as a whole, nor most individuals, have ever spent as much per year as has been wasted on misguided and ineffective anticovid measures. What's more, we're currently throwing hundreds of millions of people into poverty and despair because of a seasonal epidemics that should have been addressed by better management of our resources.</p>

        <p>You are right, too many die from hunger every day and no one's doing enough. We should. The government should send more foreign aid and we should help out more. That's the point behind foreign aid and that's the point of countless organizations around the world: to end world hunger.</p>

<p>Anti-covid measures are killing hundreds of millions. Those measures (closing businesses, blocking international traffic, instilling fear in the overwhelmingly healthy majority of the population) should be <em>abolished immediately</em> to prevent even more death and suffering.</p>

        <p>Do you have any data showing that the current measures are killing the same or more people than COVID, therefore making those decisions worse? </p>
<p>You are partially right tho, the government should do more to help its people, but it's not a matter of either opening or closing businesses. The government should give regular aid to the people who cannot work right now, to prevent them from going outside and to prevent them from losing their basic needs.</p>
<p>That's what New Zealand did, and the USA is the richest country in the world.</p>

        <p>Going off topic yet again, but no, I believe the relief bill should've been much higher and much more regular, and I believe it had nothing to do with foreign aid. The military gets practically unlimited budget. Billionaire companies get bailed out all the time. The fact that people were saying the relief bill was low because of foreign aid is a false equivalency.</p>

        <p>That’s true but when I have had the flu/cold in the past I would stay home so that I wouldn’t make others sick actually. Especially if my symptoms weren’t so bad that I really needed to stay home. Now they want us to stay home even when we aren’t sick so that we don’t make others sick. </p>
<p>How do you know you’re sick? You have symptoms. Fever, cough, dizziness, heart palpitations, joint pain...all of these point to problems in your body. They have everyone convinced that we all have covid. Symptoms or not. It’s insane. Nobody thinks they have the flu or pneumonia or a stomach virus if they have absolutely no symptoms. Virtually all viruses and diseases cause symptoms. Except covid. How convenient!</p>
<p>I can’t make someone sick when I’m not sick and if I don’t have symptoms then I’m not sick.</p>

        <p>Actually the reason covid spreads so easily is because you’re contagious prior to showing symptoms and that isn’t abnormal to most illnesses. It’s just that the number of days you’re contagious prior to showing symptoms is far greater than the flu. Think 1-2 days compared to a week. </p>
<p>Once you show symptoms, the odds you transmit an illness to someone else is very low. Partly because everyone is aware you are sick and can avoid you, but also because you’re not nearly as contagious.</p>

        <p>&rt;Actually the reason covid spreads so easily is because you’re contagious prior to showing symptoms </p>
<p>Akshually... The amount of days one is contagious prior to showing symptoms is based on a model, not demonstrated directly. The model combines pre-symptomatic spread typical for the flu with a very broad contagious period more typical of other coronaviruses. It neglects the fact that similar viruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, have the peak infectivity a whole week <em>after</em> showing the first symptoms.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that <em>some</em> infection is possible even from people before they register the typical symptoms, but <em>exactly how much</em> is a matter of debate. CDC estimates non-symptomatic spread to be 75% of symptomatic, but I believe this is vastly skewed for the sake of caution.</p>

<p>https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus</p>
<p>Happy? If you’re not listening to Harvard medical I don’t know what to tell you.</p>
<p>The question: “How soon after I'm infected with the new coronavirus will I start to be contagious?” Perfectly sums up this stupid “debate”. Have fun reading. </p>
<p>I already said I’m not interested in debating this. The topic is dangerously close to “common sense”. Good bye</p>

        <p>There's no data behind the claims in the link.</p>
<p>For a person uninterested in a debate you surely debate too much. Some might find it two-faced, or even hypocritical.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you just expect that I should accept your unscientific claims without requiring evidence?</p>
<p>I have read the original papers on "asymptomatic spread". The matter is far from cut and dried.</p>

        <p>copy and pasted from the same exact argument I was having in a different thread:</p>
<p>The original Wuhon study is actually a cross-sectional study, so they never would know if any of the 300 asymptomatic people ended up later developing symptoms. If these people did, then this would make a better case against asymptomatic spread, which would be good news for everyone. In a similar vein, a study done on SARS (a virus in the same family but not our beloved covid) showed "A total of 1 112 contactors were investigated in three surveys. Of them, 669 had a history of close contact with symptomatic SARS patients, 101 developed symptoms with a rate of 15.1%, 363 had a history of close contact with patients in their incubation period, none of whom developed symptoms (0%)." Meaning that this virus in the same family does not spread during the asymptomatic stage. link: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895398810600086?via%3Dihub">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0895398810600086?via%3Dihub</a></p>
<p>However, there currently has been data suggesting that covid is demonstrating pre-symptomatic spread. "In terms of larger COVID-19 studies that calculated the proportion of presymptomatic versus post-symptomatic spread, a study examining 468 COVID-19 cases in China found that 12.6% of transmission occurred prior to symptom onset12. Likewise, contact tracing studies of 157 locally acquired cases in Singapore identified 10 cases of presymptomatic COVID-19 transmission, but this only accounted for 6.4% of transmission events13" link: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1046-6#:~:text=In%20terms%20of%20larger%20COVID,prior%20to%20symptom%20onset12">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-1046-6#:\~:text=In%20terms%20of%20larger%20COVID,prior%20to%20symptom%20onset12</a>.</p>
<p>In the former case they identified "Fifty-nine of the 468 reports indicate that the infectee had symptoms earlier than the infector."</p>
<p>In the latter case they followed multiple clusters of people and found the same evidence in some cases, and in others found that the infectors were asymptomatic at their time of contact with the infectees. One of such clusters reads:</p>
<p>"Cluster A. A woman aged 55 years (patient A1) and a man aged 56 years (patient A2) were tourists from Wuhan, China, who arrived in Singapore on January 19. They visited a local church the same day and had symptom onset on January 22 (patient A1) and January 24 (patient A2). Three other persons, a man aged 53 years (patient A3), a woman aged 39 years (patient A4), and a woman aged 52 years (patient A5) attended the same church that day and subsequently developed symptoms on January 23, January 30, and February 3, respectively. Patient A5 occupied the same seat in the church that patients A1 and A2 had occupied earlier that day (captured by closed-circuit camera) (5). Investigations of other attendees did not reveal any other symptomatic persons who attended the church that day." link if you want to read about more of the investigated clusters: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e1.htm?s_cid=mm6914e1_w">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6914e1.htm?s_cid=mm6914e1_w</a></p>
<p>Bonus paper about pre-symptomatic spread:  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5</a> - " We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44% (95% confidence interval, 30–57%) of secondary cases were infected during the index cases’ presymptomatic stage, in settings with substantial household clustering, active case finding and quarantine outside the home. " </p>
<p>These are only case/cluster studies and it is difficult to track the onset of someones symptoms compared to someone they infected because it relies on their memories of their symptoms. It just as easily could be the case that one of these people actually had symptoms earlier, say while they were attending church, but they just weren't aware of what the symptom was. In the same vein, if we allow people to enter high population density places like grocery stores to not wear masks if they "feel well" you could fall prey to the same effect, where they actually do have symptoms but they just don't know it, or worse because they are lying about it.</p>

<p>I think you're right on the money with this. As I stated in my initial comments, I have seen evidence of some pre-symptomatic transmission, just not to the extent being used to justify most extreme measures.</p>
<p>The experience of symptoms is subjective, and thus what is being labeled asymptomatic may just be the infected person neglecting the symptoms. However, with the increased awareness of the pandemic, fewer people will be likely to neglect their symptoms, thereby decreasing further the impact of asymptomatic spread.</p>

        <p>Thank god you seem to be reasonable, been arguing all day with people trying to deny asymptomatic spread exists rather than someone saying it may not be worth avoiding. </p>
<p>Given the level of health literacy I see online and in person (people wearing masks incorrectly) I would disagree and think letting people wear masks at their own discretion until we get vaccines out is just inviting the anti-mask crowd to roll up wherever symptoms or not. </p>
<p>That is of course if you're taking the stance that we should minimize spread. Honestly at this point I don't know which strategy I'd prefer since I know I likely won't get a bad case of covid and am health literate to not give it to anyone high risk if I end up being symptomatic (or asymptomatic). I can't say I trust everyone with the same judgement. Everyone just needs to agree on whatever strategy it is but as long as the public health initiative is minimizing spread I am going to be distancing and protecting people from potential asymptomatic spread from myself.</p>

        <p>Exactly. That's why you need to wear a mask, and stay home, because pre-symptomatic people can definitely spread the disease.</p>
<p>Honestly, people just want to go out and do the exact same things they did before, saying it's about their rights to try and make it sound better and saying they can't be like this forever. It won't be. We're literally buying time until the vaccine and proper treatment arrives.</p>
<p>But when they arrive, these deniers will 100% believe they "got their rights back" because their resistance worked. I guarantee it.</p>

        <p>Nope, I don’t remember that. </p>
<p>You are right that people stay home and are bed ridden to not put unnecessary stress on their body and to help rid the virus quicker. </p>
<p>However, in parallel, they stay home and isolate if they have a contagious illness. </p>
<p>No reason to deal in absolutes here. These aren’t mutually exclusive to each other, and I’m a little worried you don’t have the mentality of staying home so other people don’t have to suffer like you did/ are regardless of the context is pre or post covid.</p>

        <p>They’re liars, they don’t really care about others. I didn’t see them doing any of this for the hundreds of thousands of people who died from the flu in 2018. Or Uyghurs being forced into slavery and being ethnically cleansed to support their disgusting materialistic consumption. They only “care” when “caring” doesn’t directly affect them</p>

        <p>Lol. Yup, slavery exists all around the world and particularly in Africa but not a peep on that subject. Criminal fucks with police in America? Cue much weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth. </p>
<p>It's all a giant exercise in virtue signaling. Doomerism, Biden voting, BLM, etc. they're all symptoms of the "too much time and too much social media on my hands while being not very bright" disease.</p>

        <p>You can start by consuming less stuff. Do you really need that new pair of sneakers when you already have perfectly functioning ones? Or a new iPhone? Also go to brands that don’t outsource to China and slave labor. It can be more expensive but it just cuts down your buying in the end. There’s tons we can do but we don’t do it because we don’t care to stop. Because it will directly affect us. And that’s my point.</p>

        <p>The other side: ofcourse we care about the other deaths (like the suicides) that's why we need to quearantine. If everyone would just comply for a month this would all be over. But people like you, the anti mask idiots keep spreading covid so we have to be in lockdown longer. If we all would just stay home this would have been over back in May. The people commiting suicide now is because.of people like you!!!</p>

        <p>I have questioned the lockdowns from the beginning and many times over the last 10 months I have questioned if I am on wrong side of this issue but every time I try and look at it from other perspectives, it just doesn’t add up. And I’m not one that believes the virus is a hoax, I do believe people are dying (still only know 1 person personally that had it and it was mild). But it’s a very small percentage of the population that is fatally affected by this, so there should absolutely be attention focused on protecting the most vulnerable, while simultaneously keeping the economy running and protecting lives from the negative effects of the lockdowns. This is so simple and it astounds me more people can’t see it.</p>

        <p>here's another one OP. If they really believed the virus was something worth worrying about, and spreading the virus actually mattered, why wouldn't they hazmat up before leaving the house? Instead they take virtually no precaution at all. They know plenty of people won't wear the masks, and most masks are just fabric, they're totally useless, but instead of actually protecting themselves, these fuckfaces just get mad at us about the masks and do nothing. Does this shit seriously make any sense to anyone?</p>

        <p>It's the exact same way with gun controllers. They want to ban me from owning firearms meanwhile thugs in LA and IL are having shootouts daily. </p>
<p>It's not about gun deaths, it's about taking guns away from conservatives. We've figured this out years ago. </p>

        <p>I don't think it's as simple as virtue signaling. If it were, then they wouldn't care as much about YOU wearing a mask. Ultimately it comes down to fear for THEMSELVES, which is why it's so important to them that you also wear one. I think it has moved past the virtue signaling phase and into full blown panic that they will catch the virus, and die a painful death or have long term effects. I don't think there has been more divisive policy since Jim Crow. Only thing I'm not sure of is if it's intentionally pitting people against one another or if it simply tapped into some kind of primal source of fear that took on a life of it's own, and now the media is running with it for their benefit.</p>

        <p>Exactly what I think too. They're afraid their 20-year-old ass will catch the airborne plague, and that scares their self-absorbed, germaphobic asses.</p>
<p>Very few are concerned for others while having little concern for themselves catching this virus.</p>

        <p>These doomers are just golems animated by their TV screens to act out with little to no consideration behind the meaning of their suggested behaviors; it seems to quite literally be -. wear mask= good/don't wear mask=evil, care about Covid deaths=good/care about other deaths=blank, and so forth. I don't think they're brave enough to even think so deeply as to admit that their necrotic fixation on "Covid" deaths is at the expense of so many other deaths and sufferings.</p>

<p>If your particular cause to support is curing cancer, nobody could blame you if you're not doing enough to support, say, wounded veterans.</p>
<p>You can't do everything, and that's fine.  </p>
<p>The problem comes when you ask people to forget their problems and support yours unquestionably, and then treat them as selfish if they don't comply.  Of course they're fucking selfish!  They have to be in order to look after themselves when the world seems to be telling them their problem isn't even worth mentioning.  </p>

<p>I bet there is a lot of protections you use in your daily life that is so mundane that you do not think about it, so why not adding another simple protection that might help you and your family and people around you to stay safe? Why are you such a tryhard?</p>

        <p>And those are things that are reasonable protections for safety.</p>
<p>How far do things have to go before it's full-on abdication of personal responsibility?</p>
<p>Like, say, the government telling you that you can't drink because drunk driving causes accidents?   </p>
<p>Or the government telling you that you can't have particular foods because they're not healthy?</p>
<p>There is overreach.  There are circumstances where it can be said that eventually, one has to be responsible for oneself.  Until this year, illness what your own responsibility, not a communal one.  What changed?</p>
<p>Oh, it's "novel".  </p>
<p>Except, it really isn't.  COVID is behaving like a LOT of other viruses.  The only difference is that the media has promoted it as somehow more dangerous than others.  And because a lot of people can't be bothered to look into it, they're kept in a constant state of panic.</p>
<p>So, miss me with your pseudo-virtuous bullshit.  Because THAT is the real "tryhard".</p>

        <p>This is a pandemic... of course i and many others want to protect everyone but this is a new and fast spreading virus that we dont know much about. And we have been battling others diseases too. Like ebola and aids. Even tho they have a higher death percentage they spread way less quickly. And we have done so much for all kinds of diseases, but this is new, the last time we saw something like this Was 100 years ago. And you’re not really doing a great job at protecting people if you dont follow the regulations so you care the least out of anybody.</p>

        <p>It's not fucking new, you clown.  It's been around since last December.  It's the most intensely studied virus in human history.  There are no more mysteries.  It's basically a spicy cold virus that overwhelmingly targets people who are already on the verge of death.</p>

        <p>Thats not even true. If we knew everything about the virus why are cases still skyrocketing. You dont know anything about diseases so stop acting like a professor. And it doesnt only kill people on the verge of death you idiot, my uncle of 57 died of it and was very healthy person. 1.8mill people have died and you’re still holding on to “its a strong flu”. So stfu.</p>
