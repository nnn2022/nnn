    <strong>Divide &amp; Conquer Making Me Nervous</strong>
    <p><p>I believe there is mounting evident to suggest that the the handling of this virus is a concerted to divide those who believe in individualism from those who believe in the Marxist ideology.  This could be seen as the “right” vs the “left” in common American terminology.  I understand that those on the right are not all the same, as I also place Libertarians on the right.  However, it’s pretty evident that they are using masks, lockdowns, &amp; social media to target and silence dissenters.  I have come to the conclusion that Trump (even if you don’t agree with him), was used to tarnish the idea of individual rights and Americanism by making him to seem as he is similar to “Hitler” or an entity so bad, that anybody associated with any of his ideas is should be despised &amp; inhuman.  This now includes non-Trump (e.g., libertarians) supporters that believe in free speech and limited government.  It’s making me nervous because social media is now silencing and pushing out those who believe in free speech.  Please tell me, what are you thoughts on MeWe &amp; Parler as alternatives to FB &amp; Twitter?  Should we fear that these will be used to target the “dissenters” in future or are these tools good alternatives to show the Big Tech companies that we will not stand for these violations on individual/human rights?</p></p>

        <p>I don't know why people insist on making it a left-right issue. Divide and conquer is literally the only game states know how to play, hence accumulating wealth can continue to be the only thing their intellectuals and contractors know how to do. There's nothing new in any of this, except the potential for mass-surveillance, and we won't be rid of it until we are rid of the state entirely.</p>

        <p>Hey, it looks like I found a fellow libertarian or Ancap.  Don’t take my initial statement the wrong way, my point was that anything individualistic is the enemy.  I guess you could say, it would be: Pro-State/Government Interventionism vs Anti-State or Limited Government.</p>

        <p>Great discussion on this topic going on on r/GoldandBlack</p>
<p>You hit the nail on the head, we are seeing what happens when a traditionally individualistic population has collectivist policies pushed on it. But the United States is not like the collectivist nations, it can't be! The country is too new and too large.</p>

        <p>Marxism doesn't have to be your enemy either. What's happening under lockdown? The majority of us, individually <em>and</em> collectively, get screwed over and the mega-rich and powerful get mega-richer and more powerful. Basic idea of Marxists is to turn that narrow pyramid upside down: that's the real collective. Now, maybe as a right Libertarian (they don't all belong on the right), you actually intended to support Bezos Vs. Everyone else in the name of the free market, but from the objection to Big Tech, it doesn't sound like that's what you want any more than the far left do.</p>
<p>Trump is just theatre, I think, American politics are a show to distract you all, didn't he seem to be a Dem at one point?</p>

        <p>I understand what you’re saying, we have a oligarchy.  I 100% agree with you.  One correction: no right libertarian with a brain supports Bezo’s because Amazon receives subsidies from the government.  No libertarian I know would ever be in favor of redistribution of wealth.  Monopolies do not exist in free market, but are created by government intervention.  It is true that those with power use Marxism as a way of achieving power under an oligarchy.</p>

        <p>One of the things I've wondered -genuinely-, is how do you figure a right Libertarian society would work out with the starting point we have now? Definitely agree about government subsidies, but even if they were made to pay them back, they'd still be sitting on loads of dosh, which subsidies helped them make. To me that's the point of redistribution of wealth, that the starting point is rigged, so to have a more ideal society it's necessary to level the playing field.</p>
<p>Anyone with power can always claim to be a member of a political ideology if it looks like the fastest route to more power in the moment, then turn round and betray that ideology.</p>
