    <strong>Wasn't Wal-Mart one of the chains that said no more masks if you're "vaccinated"?</strong>
    <p><p>I swear I saw articles on multiple sites, stating that certain corporations were no longer requiring these lame ass masks and would be using the "honor system" and whatnot. I guess that doesn't go for New York or idk. That cocksucking tyrant Cuomo is still overriding store policies? This dumb shit is confusing.</p></p>

        <p>I was in a Walmart in Upstate ny in the southern adirondacks and the sign said masks recommended.. The required sign had been changed. I shopped maskless. This was three weeks ago. I am not vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Everywhere is dumb as fuck with these rules. </p>
<p>I can’t go buy car engine oil because the stores have been told it’s not an essential item, except I need it to operate my car on a regular basis, and confusingly enough mechanic shops are allowed to stay open, because they are essential, so how are mechanics getting their oil? Whole sale? Well how can whole sale sell oil to shops but wholesale can’t sell oil to people? It makes no fucking sense. </p>
<p>A prime example is Costco, used to buy oil there for cheap, they are considered a wholesaler, yet they can’t sell oil to me. So either I pay hiked up prices at a shop, I cease driving all together, or I just drive my car for the next “2 weeks to flatten the curve” and see how long it lasts without an engine oil change. The government has really made every single option unbearable</p>

        <p>Global warming - outdated term, climate change, too ambiguous. </p>
<p>The blunt truth is, we as humans have had a tangible environmental impact. It’s not always as the media wants to spin it, but it’s real and to ignore it simply because some idiot in congress is telling you what to do would just be foolish. </p>
<p>You don’t have to like people in power to be able to discern for yourself with facts and evidence when there is truth to some things they say. </p>
<p>Humans environmental impact is one such thing where there is truth to that concern, though as you call it “the left” don’t actually care about undoing this damage solely for the benefit of humanity, it’s more about the control aspect, but it’s still a valid concern none the less. </p>
<p>The species we have caused to go extinct is not some conspiracy, it’s pretty clear by the things we’ve done/contributed to. </p>
<p>I’m not sure why so many people in this subreddit are opposed to the idea that humans have had a negative environmental impact. Is it just a result of defying everything the government tells you simply because you don’t like them or don’t trust them?</p>
