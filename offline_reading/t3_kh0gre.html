    <strong>Situation in Australia is Breaking Me</strong>
    <p><p>Of all Western countries with relatively few cases, Australia seems to have had just about the most extreme reactions to really minimal increases in case numbers (not deaths - case numbers).
Each time a state manages to clear a so-called “outbreak” (recently, an “outbreak” could be 10 cases, evidently...), and borders start to reopen, another state “conveniently” starts finding another bunch of cases, and if all goes to shit again...</p>
<p>Right now, our biggest state, NSW, has 70 active cases, only 30 of which are “locally acquired”, in the last week or so...</p>
<p>As a result of this, everyone is mass-panicking. The media is spreading fear like mad. Hell, I would go further and say they are spreading hysteria, at this point.
Borders are slamming closed. Events that have never been cancelled in their history (Sydney - Hobart yacht race) have been canned. Everyone is being told to wear masks (the media wants to make them mandatory, of-fucking-course). Families are going to be separated at Christmas. New Year is essentially dead. We’re being told that we should PAY EXTRA, as individuals, if we want to get vaccines early, for some possible extra “freedoms”. Oh, and finally, if you want to go to a fucking pub or cafe, in Qld, you literally have to sign in with a QR code, every time now. Despite there being NO CASES in Qld for months. Don’t have a code reader? Tough. I guess you’d better just “stay home”. “People are dirty and dangerous, anyway! Stay away”</p>
<p>I just... I don’t think I can keep going like this. No holidays. No interstate travel. No seeing friends? Honestly... I don’t think I can live with this for six more months, over this few cases. I really, really don’t.</p></p>

        <p>Nah, we’ve been like this for ages, man...</p>
<p>We don’t protest (unless it’s something really trendy, and endorsed by government, like BLM, or Greta’s shit...), and we never stand up to authority, anymore.</p>
<p>We love our “convenient” work from home shit. We love our “comfortable” lives. So we just do exactly what the media, and authorities, tell us to do... :-(
We’re a very conformist, collectivist society, over here. You’d be surprised, evidently!</p>

        <p>That's surprising to hear.  I associate collectivism with homogenous communist hellholes in Asia where people are given no rights, but not Australia.  In the U.S. we are built on rebellion and on not being reigned in, but we have an incoming government that will be trying to use this pandemic to flex its muscles.</p>

        <p>Nah, we like to think we’re “rebels” over here, but we’re really not.
Don’t believe the stereotypes this country tries to tell you about itself.
We’re so comfortably, thoroughly middle class, and have been for at least 25 years, that we would never do anything to “rock the boat”, and potentially lose some of that comfort.</p>
<p>Ask any actual everyday Australian. You’ll find that, as a society, the “laid back” thing is just a myth we like to tell ourselves. It is objectively not true.</p>
<p>I mean, dude, r/Australia is one of the biggest censored shitholes on Reddit. Maybe that tells you something, about at least some elements of “our” society - those in control - over here... :-/</p>

        <p>Probably depends who you ask.
I hate him. Some of my “friends” love him.
He has the requisite personality cult, though.
“Daddy Dan”. “Dan for PM”. “Dan saved my life”.
You can even get Brett Sutton’s face (Dan’s chief medical officer) on a pillow.
I am not making this shit up, sadly... :-S</p>

        <p>Very surprised. Years ago, I spent a month driving around a few of the territories down south. Between cities I hardly saw any other cars. I was there in August. </p>
<p>It probably didn't help that I dated an Aussie last year who's lived here for about 20 years. Loved Trump, guns, and FrEeDoM. Funny story. He showed me his tat and asked me who it was. I said Boba Fett😂 Of course it was Ned Kelly. </p>
<p>When I used to travel Europe, all the hostels were run by Aussies. Every bar, Aussies. I imagine the lockdown and travel restrictions are especially hard.</p>

        <p>Re travel, yeah, that’s probably what’s killing me the most, honestly... :-(</p>
<p>We’re one of the only countries in the world with an “exit ban”, essentially meaning we cannot leave our own country until a vaccine is found, and rolled out, and even then, we won’t be allowed to travel overseas without first showing “proof” we’ve been vaccinated... How’s that for freedom? :-(</p>
<p>Also, I think it’s important to note that the Aussies you meet overseas, in those bars, or like your bloke you mentioned, aren’t the average Australian. The average, “real” “middle” Aussie, now, is a boring “woke” suburban (older) millennial, who follows whatever the government and media tells them to, without question.
They might take a “gap yah”, around Europe, but they’re not gonna be the laidback chick or dude you see working the bar, longterm...
They would be far too uncomfortable there, without their precious lockout laws and bike helmets, lol...</p>
<p>We’re a dying breed, unfortunately, us Aussie free spirits... :-(</p>
<p>Just look up Zoe Buhler, and what happened to her, and the response she received on social media afterwards. Or “Karen from Brighton”... Australia just doesn’t care about freedoms anymore, sadly. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

        <p>I hate my bubble has been burst. We obviously have a lot of that type here too. I can't even stand to hear our National anthem anymore. The land of the free and the home of the brave. Pfft
But I do know lots and lots of Americans who are preparing for Civil War over this. I'll be joining them if it ever gets that bad. </p>
<p>My closest friend in Oz, who I met in York, UK, is having a hard time. He absolutely lives for minimalist vacations all over the world. He is lucky he's been to so many amazing places, but he's still young enough to keep doing it. We've been planning a cross country US trip for years. I hope when the time comes he'll be "allowed". It's my hope that keeps me going at all.</p>

<p>Yeah, I’m running out of hope, honestly. Hence this post.</p>
<p>Re the anthem, at least you can still sing yours, in English, with the proper lyrics!
We’re right in the middle of slowly consigning that “privilege” to the past, ha...
Or trying to.</p>
<p>Ah, sorry to burst your bubble, lol.</p>
<p>Yeah, we ain’t like that here, sadly. As I explained.
But also, no guns. Practically no one here is armed. So it’s a very different... Society, really.
Even if people wanted to “rise up”, or do anything like that, the chances of putting up any resistance, here, to any sort of overreach? Are even less than you would find in pretty much any other Western country.</p>
<p>I hate to use the term “cucked”, but as a country, or a populace..? Well, we’re pretty neutered, to say the least, at this point, lol...</p>

        <p>For now we can. For now. We had a rough year with BLM on top of this Rona and gender shit the year before. There are like 100 genders now lmfao. </p>
<p>This whole situation has had me rethink a lot of the beliefs I once held. You all had that one terrible shooting and gave up all of your guns immediately. Or so we're told. Last year we had a shooting every week. And many others before that. Like how much of this is real and how much of it is fabricated? I never had those thoughts before.</p>

<p>Yes, we definitely have big stretches of essentially nothingness, and no people. Of course, the thing is, you now need a (paid) “permit” to travel any of those roads, because they “cross Aboriginal land”... 😛
Even if you never see another human, you have to “pay your respects” (fees in the hundreds of dollars), to have “permission to travel” there, lol...</p>

Though... I have to admit I could do better at that, too.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that, though!</p>
<p>And yeah, it’s... Decreasingly like that, now.
Dunno where you went, but many, many of the off-road tracks have been closed, now (Great Australian Bight, NW Tas), because they “offend Australian sensibilities”, lol...</p>
<p>I’m sure you know about the Ayers Rock climb being closed. Guess what? That wasn’t enough for some of the “Traditional Owners”, so earlier in the year they literally blockaded it, to stop us wypipo from getting in, and “contaminating” it...
Standoff lasted for weeks. And the government, and authorities, dared not question them, lol...</p>
<p>So yeah. Happy to help with any tips I can, lol, but yeah, you’re not missing much with the place that we’ve become, lately, sadly... :-S</p>

        <p>Ha I never saw that slang before and new exactly what it meant. I tried to look up permits and found a few, but it's hard to find anything through the covid restrictions permit shit. I drove basically the entirety of NSW and VIC. Went to Adelaide and then drove up to Cameron's corner and back to Sydney. I stayed in King's Cross😂 It was a great time and I did it alone. I spent a month puttering around. I remember when they banned camping on Ayer's/Uluru. That was disappointing and something I was planning on doing later. I wanted my next drive to be through Queensland and the NT and back down to the big red rock. It looks a lot harder to do now even without Rona. I'm glad the US never had restrictions like that, but who knows what our future now holds.</p>

        <p>Feel ya man, my family went up to NSW last week and now they're stuck there atm because Dan Andrews shut our fuckin border down over nothing. Hopefully they can make it back before the cut off otherwise they'll be forced to pay thousands in hotel quarantine fees. </p>
<p>Although it's not like we were the pinnacle of freedoms and liberties before Rona. Our government has been gradually eroding our rights for decades, like a frog in a kettle, and it's only now that we've noticed the water is starting to boil.</p>

Yep. I just responded to a yank in another thread, saying how I’m completely unsurprised by any of this... So trust me, I know.</p>
<p>Yeah, in Tas at the moment (against my wishes). “Our” premier has basically committed Seppuku on the state economy, cancelling literally all our Summer events now... Arrogant prick that he is.</p>
<p>I feel like we just lurch from one “crisis” to another, now - each being used to enforce ever more and more draconian measures. And the media just laps it up, and even amplifies the fucking bullshit...
It’s just so... Fucking exhausting.</p>

<p>Pretty much everything lol, we're still a fucking penal colony, we don't even have freedom of speech, closest thing we get is "freedom of expression", yet somehow the government can decide what and how you express yourself. </p>
<p>Oh and did you know the premier in Victoria wants to make it illegal to have a protest without applying for a permit? https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/7048963/permission-may-be-needed-to-stage-protests-in-victoria/?cs=10229</p>
<p>So basically he'll get to decide who can and can't protest, oh but I'm sure that law will go away when covid is gone lmao good joke.

        <p>So this just shows how broken our society is: a very large number of people flew from Sydney to Adelaide last night, to try to get back before borders arbitrarily shut. Some paid $700 for the “privilege”.
Guess what? They got there, only to be told that they would be forced into 2 weeks hotel quarantine, randomly, anyway.
So no family Christmas, and a massive hotel bill that they weren’t even told about before boarding their planes.
Fucking outrageous!! 😡</p>

        <p>I live nowhere near Australia, but I really do feel for both you, and all Australians who are forced to suffer under this madness because the media have nothing better to do than rack up viewership via hysteria. Australia is by far the most draconian of countries, whether it’s Melbourne smashing car windows and breaking into houses, to Western Australia banning dog walking because a pizza worker told a lie about his place of employment. </p>
<p>Similar to New Zealand. A singular family got coronavirus, and the entire city of Auckland shutdown because of it. They also force people into camps if they refuse to isolate. That’s why their case numbers are so low.</p>
<p>Anyway, to both you and everyone in Sydney, I wish the best. But I bet the governor of NSW will break under the media hysteria and force masks, the cancellation of Christmas festivities, and the shutdown of all small businesses. As someone living under these conditions at present, it’s going to be awful.</p>

        <p>Nah, Tas is bad. Qld is bad. Depends on how you define “hard lockdowns”, does it not?
If I can’t travel, or see my friends, or go out, or go to an event, or go to a cafe without “signing in online”, but I’m not in lockdown - is that really that much better, lol..?</p>
<p>WA... Ah WA. I mean look, yes, freedoms are better in WA in that sense, but the border thing, all the bluster, all the threats and legal/financial bullshit. All that talk of “WAxit”..?

        <p>Honestly? Nowhere. 😔
If you can get into WA (Western Australia) despite border closures, and stay there, then restrictions over there are not quite as severe (internally, as long as you don’t leave...).
Other than that, your only real option is to befriend a yacht captain, and sail out to sea, lol, as a few people I’ve seen on the news have done. :-S</p>
<p>But officially? There is no escape. We very specifically can’t flee, which is the whole point of their law to that effect, I expect... 😞</p>
<p>Also why they keep denying suicide spikes, each time they introduce more, increasingly draconian measures. If you just get your official figures to “deny” it, and pretend it isn’t happening, if it goes against your narrative, and get the media to do a full blackout on the story..?
Well then, your population are none the wiser, are they? 😕
It really sucks. It really, really does. 😞</p>

        <p>Being told, “Suck it up and enjoy it, citizen! So what if you have to spend all of Summer at home! You should enjoy that! At least you have access to a house!”, by all the mainstream media, is very, very weird...</p>
<p>None of that shit would have been at all acceptable to say, a year ago - especially if your target audience had perhaps experienced domestic violence, or came from a broken home (as examples), or had lost their home in the bushfires...</p>
<p>The window of “acceptable [media/big government] discourse” has shifted so far, so quickly, in this country and elsewhere, that I just can’t keep up... :-/</p>

        <p>Ha, ah Bluey...
Used to enjoy it, then it got waaaay too big, and too commercialised, over here (Bluey merch is f*#king everywhere...), and then they started going back and censoring episodes...</p>

        <p>This morning, someone I was talking to (in America, I assume) on another Reddit post, said that seeing more characters in a scene of her favourite tv show, at a time, than restrictions allow, makes her feel physically sick... Because it was filmed after the pandemic, and the situation is “so bad” in the US... 🙄</p>
<p>Health anxiety, fear and (probably, later) snitching on behalf of other people, because they may have flouted some arbitrary rule, WHILE FILMING A TV SHOW... 😤
That’s scary. Not the pandemic itself. That.</p>

        <p>In case anyone was wondering just how pathetic Australians can be, there are two houses in Greater Melbourne currently doing “famous” Christmas sound and light shows which, according to the ABC, feature tributes to [our “great” leader] Dan Andrews...🤬</p>
<p>They are (apparently) regularly attracting hundreds of viewers each night (despite Dan, not too long ago, arresting people for daring to even think about gathering in crowds like that, lololol), and are raising money for GOVERNMENT-ENDORSED charities...</p>
<p>I mean, you honestly couldn’t make this shit up, some Australians (<em>cough</em> Victorians <em>cough cough</em>) are so pathetic... 🙄</p>
