    <strong>It seems like people can't go back to normal, at least not in the way they anticipated.</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen this with my friends, neighbors, and really in the general sense of society all together.</p>
<p>To put it briefly - Most normal non-hypochondriac people were more than excited to return to a life with no masks, with indoor dining at full capacity, concerts and large scale gatherings. Like most of us here, we were happy to be away from this fear-driven mindset and ready to get back to life in the most pre-covid way possible.</p>
<p>That doesn't seem to be the case. There is this extremely evident behavior of jadedness, fatigue, maybe even sadness in the world. My friends aren't even hanging out with each other as much as we did before this. People still appear to be drained.... What do you even call it? Robotic, a lack of energy or will to do anything.</p>
<p>I don't understand... some were even predicting a "roaring 20's" type world all over again but it's the complete opposite. It's not like they are still entranced by the fear but unable to recalibrate themselves from what they have just been through. A 14+ month long government sponsored campaign of fear and one day the switch flipped the other way and we were told "Okay, you can go out now".</p>
<p>I won't say that people are as depressed as they were in covid, but in comparison to 2019 and now - it's not even close. The entire world seems so jaded and fatigued.</p></p>

        <p>I've said before, for all Games of Thrones fans out there, that sometimes I almost feel like Reek... </p>
<p>So abused, gaslighted and denied any dignities as a perfectly healthy person for so long, that when they open the door, I don't trust I should go out, like it's a trick lol</p>
<p>That being said, a lot of things were said by people, done by people against others that will not easily be forgotten.</p>
<p>you kind of lose love for a country who so happily trampled on your rights to serve themselves, so happily and gleefully cheered as your face was put in the dirt, or the guns of State were wielded against you on their behalf.. told you were 'non-essential', etc and if you're White, unprecedented attacks on your tribe and history non-Covid19 related - not only calling you a 'superspreader', 'deplorable and a 'leper', but a 'rapist' 'opportunist', 'genocidist' and every other name in the book.  </p>
<p>Canada is not my country anymore. Right now it feels more like a prison, and most likely as I live it out here, just an address on a map for me. They did a great job breaking the social contract.</p>
<p>Maybe I will change my mind about that by finding more like-minded individuals from all of this and salvage whatever is left.</p>

        <p>I honestly feel that this has triggered millions of people into severe OCD and many are holding the rest of us hostage.... In some places at least. I am in nyc and it just feels gross and awful here. The energy is gone. It feels like everyone has PTSD. After what I've been through here I feel like my abuser is still on the loose and ready to pounce on me at any time. I am in a constant state of sleeping with one eye open waiting for the next insane arbitrary rule or mandate.</p>

        <p>Well, the constant clown shows called lockdowns drained everyone’s energy over the last one and a half years. They also caused severe physical, but more importantly, psychological damage to a huge portion of the population.</p>
<p>Another important factor is the 24/7 propaganda being shoved down our throats from every direction you look. It doesn’t matter if it is the media, government, news outlets, prominent figures or other individuals and institutions, they all have the same goals and agendas and they keep pushing them. This led the majority of people to go into energy saving mode and use the minimal amount of thinking and analysis in day to day interactions, since they now only need to listen to those in power who know better and will do all the thinking on their behalf to “keep them safe”.</p>

        <p>&rt;That doesn't seem to be the case. There is this extremely evident behavior of jadedness, fatigue, maybe even sadness in the world. </p>
<p>Could be a side effect of the vaccines. Some people have no side effects at all, some people collapse on the soccer field, and I'm sure a lot of people are in between. A few coworkers complained about weird pounding headaches that feel different from other headaches. Tiredness seems to be a common side effect. Neck and shoulder pain is another, and any kind of pain really reduces how enthusiastic I would be to do anything.</p>
<p>Could also be a weird existential crisis in a lot of people. When you're faced with the prospect of death from a virus or cancer or something, you're forced to examine your life. Does your life have meaning? Did you accomplish anything? Would anyone miss you? Was it all worth doing? If you died tomorrow, would anyone notice you were gone? It would be a real kick to the ego when a person is 35, has no kids, doesn't own a house, and both the government and their employer deemed them non-essential.</p>

        <p>Well, fatigue is understandable, no?   I went to Peach Fest and that was full of total fun! And the local amusement park was busy city today, with only a handful of masked amidst hundreds- in WNY, of all places!  I mean.. with adhd, being a single mom to a kid that never went to school... I feel like I’ll be fatigued for at least a decade.</p>
