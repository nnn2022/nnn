    <strong>Voting - We Have To Balance The Scale</strong>
    <p><p>I think there have been many in here saying their politics have changed after all of this nonsense.  As a former Democrat, I share the sentiments.</p>
<p>But with everything going on, we need to be strategic.  I don‚Äôt like the Republicans but I think that‚Äôs the only way out of this ‚Äúcountry of control.‚Äù</p>
<p>This will be my first time ever voting Republican but it‚Äôs what needs to happen.  Libertarian votes will just keep Dems in office and further their reach.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt know how to proceed but I plan on volunteering for campaigns if I need to or contribute in whatever means possible to block and/or reverse these Draconian policies.</p></p>

        <p>Be careful where you put your time and money.  I say this as a life-long republican who laid down her arms after 2020. So many of them take heritage Republicans for granted that they thought crapping all over Trump was acceptable behavior never mind that they were by extension crapping on his supporters too. Then you have the Rubios who made all of the right Reaganesque noise until he took his oath of office and promptly joined the gang of 8 or 6 (,too lazy to look it up). Don't even get me started on that jackass Romney. </p>

        <p>I agree with you but what‚Äôs the solution?  As much as I‚Äôd like to break bipartisanship, the third party vote is a wasted vote.</p>

        <p>My personal solution is to vet who gets my vote and time carefully. Im also very open to not voting every race. Even though they don't know who voted,, it's public record in Florida how ballots are voted. People are paid to scrutinize that data. Democrats are automatically excluded. I consider the democratic party to be little more than a cult. Occasionally they let a "blue dog" make conservative noise but when rubber meets road, he's a democrat in their floor and committee votes. </p>
<p>Desantis is an example of a republican who will have my support unless he does something stupid. He lifted the mask mandate without apology and dared the left to say vaccines were ineffective if they wanted to cling to their masks and gloves. He's been steady in the face of several devastating storms and he never ever faltered in his support for President Trump. Rubio, Romney, and McConnell can suck a lollipop üç≠.</p>
