    <strong>Message To All The People On This Sub, Who Are Losing Hope and Are Depressed Regarding The Current Circumstances. Must Read.</strong>
    <p><p>I had written and posted this awhile back on My old account but of course, Reddit shadow banned it and all My posts got automatically removed. I'm reposting this because apparently a new lockdown is set to be in place due to these never ending variants. WHO now is commanding for the fully vaccinated to again mask up and this just shows you that some of the "freedoms" they have given back to you is only temporary. The worst is yet to come.</p>
<p>There have been many posts in the past couple days regarding people losing hope, and feeling depressed and being very uncertain about their future and career goals. First of all, before I say anything, you are all very blessed and privileged to be on this Sub. Yes. You are very aware and red pilled regarding society and what's truly happening around Us, and the direction that we are heading towards. You are ahead of the Game. While the doomers are still quadmasking, with their hazmat suits on and thinking we are "progressing." Fuck them. Due to their compliance and obedience this shi is never ending. If the government was to say, "Jump off a cliff and you'll never get covid" these people will happily do so.</p>
<p>All of Us on this Sub, did not come in this world to be fucking lab rats. Fuck that. We all came here for a purpose and our purpose here is not to give away our basic freedoms, and rights for a so called "disease" which has a 99.7% survival rate. How foolish of the doomers, who have given away their everything for all of this? You are very lucky that you have the real knowledge and are truly woke. The government, society and the media wants you to have suicidal thoughts and wants you to be depressed. They do not give a fuck about you. In the end, YOU have to make something of this life, and get ahead in anyway possible you can. Because in the end, it's just you. Whether it's that rat looking fauci or the WHO or the elite, we simply are lab rats to them. Nothing more.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of time, it has only been survival of the fittest, and never survival of the unfittest. Every person here must Master Machiavellianism. Regarding how to act, what to say in each and every situation he is confronted with, and use it for his own benefit in a very clever and intellectual way. People spend their whole life in thinking what he/she/society will think about me and guess what? They are left nowhere. They neither achieve their goals, because they put others above them, and they lose all the respect people had for them (These are the Doomers). Why? Because they keep on obeying and bowing down to society and taking it up the ass from them, and then they are taken for granted. Once you're that vulnerable, your destiny is only to get used and thrown out, and that's the exact fate and destiny of the doomers that will take place. You must never be too agreeable, rather stick to your principles and values. Always. </p>
<p>The government doesn't gaf about you neither the doomers. LOL. The doomers are only their lab rats and guinea pig to test their experimental gene therapy "vaccines." And guess what? They will have so many fucking booster shots and it will make the doomers comply so much that they will be equivalent of slaves on leashes for the government. You come alone in this life, and you die alone. So, dgaf about others and what they think about you, rather do what YOU have to do. We are lucky that we understand all of this and we were never meant to obey to anyone (except God). This is a free fucking country and Fuck them doomers. </p>
<p>With this cyber scamdemic on the way and lockdown talks to lock us up again, we truly don't know what's going to happen. The cyber scamdemic will destroy the supply chain, while another set of lockdows will destroy our mental healths. Fuck that. And fuck these authoritarian psychopaths who never gave a fuck about us anyway and merely see the world as a game to play with. We have no control unfortunately. They do. But what we have is the power to unite and never fucking comply. I rather die with a spine and pride than ever taking this jab or giving control of Myself to these authoritarian nazi psychopaths. Fuck them.  And the worst are the doomers who are so brainwashed and just don't see that they're getting played. </p>
<p>You know, I wish we all were neighbors and could have partied and got fucked up everyday. There are a only a very few people who are truly woke. Don't fall into the trap of society and get depressed, rather take life as an adventure and an game and do NOT fear death. Live everyday like it's your last, as life is very short and enjoy it and dgaf about anything except yourself and your loved ones. In the end, nobody is helping you. You have to help yourself. Be positive, try making like minded friends and do what you have to do. Remember, whenever any of you gets those thoughts, you are only making the government and media happy. You want them happy? F them. They can go F themselves, only make yourself and your loved one's happy. That's it.</p></p>
