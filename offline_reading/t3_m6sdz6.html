    <strong>Has anyone else cut pro lockdowners out of their lives?</strong>
    <p><p>I cannot bring myself to speak to my mother. Can’t do it. I’m enraged. She is pro lockdown, pro lockdown, pro Biden/Fauci.  I have gone a year without an income due to lockdowns. A year. I had a very successful business and was a good daughter and supported and took care family members. No one ever did a damn thing for me. They are now all fat and happy while I lose everything. I am furious. My mother and I have a joint bank account bc I never closed my childhood account. I’m middle aged. She put a large sum of money in it today and texted me that she loves me.  I can’t sleep and I am furious. I would rather starve than take a dime from her.  Help!</p></p>

        <p>No, I don't think it's healthy to cut people out of your life for having different views - especially not your mother who obviously loves you. I just feel sad reading this. I hope you can mend things after this charade is finally over.</p>

        <p>Voting does nothing. The elections are all staged anyway so the only way anything is going to change is if people actually take up arms which seems to be the least likely thing. You and me certainly aren't doing it right now.
I view these people more like victims of brainwashing than actually at fault.
We who know better aren't doing the right thing and that's why we're really in this mess.</p>

        <p>i agree. getting angry and hateful towards the brainwashed sheep is pointless and plays right into their plans. This is all designed to put us into different groups and pit us against each other so that we destroy ourselves. </p>
<p>you don't get angry at a child for not understanding algebra. it's sad, but this has revealed very plainly how simple minded most people actually are. they're not intellectually capable of questioning their programming</p>

        <p>I know you're in a tough situation right now and you're very obviously upset but I promise you that you'll regret cutting her out of your life. She never wanted your business to fail and certainly isn't pleased about it, she's just supporting what she believes is the best route out of this so-called pandemic. Deep down she just wants everyone to be safe - especially her family. She might've missed the mark but what parents don't?</p>
<p>She's given you money (which you don't need to accept) and texted you that she loves you. She doesn't want to see you fail and is obviously holding out an olive branch. It's up to you at the end of the day, maybe when things have recovered you'll be more willing to heal your relationship with her.</p>
<p>Good luck either way, I am really sorry about your business, I have been beyond outraged at how small businesses have been treated throughout this past year.</p>

        <p>She voted to destroy me. There is no forgiveness. Orange man bad. She and her rich friends all run around squealing about Trump. It’s a fucking game to them. They are old. They have no skin in the game. The don’t have to make a living. They don’t have to put their kids in critical race theory infested schools, their daughters don’t have to compete against biological males in sports. They don’t care about the tax burden they are leaving behind. They don’t care. I am done.  If she cared about me, she would have stayed home and waited for her precious vaccine. She ran around. She voted for lockdowns that DESTROYED me and my future and my childrens’ futures.</p>

        <p>I totally get it, I have family members with such views too, but at the end of the day they're still family and I still love them. Also, keep in mind that you're voting against their interests too, it's a two-way street.</p>
<p>I don't really want to get into any sort of debate, I just hate seeing families break up over things like this. Good luck with whatever you decide to do.</p>

        <p>My mum voted for Brexit and used my dad's vote and I suspect she deliberately 'lost' my vote which she knew I'd use to vote stay. By leaving Europe I lost 25 years of hard work, a beautiful piece of land, which I'd spent years preparing for this very moment, and now we've both lost touch with my French son.</p>

        <p>From what you've said I'm assuming she's progressively inclined. My point is that she is also likely upset at how you have voted in the past and believes that your beliefs are damaging to society. </p>
<p>She obviously doesn't want to see you or her grandchildren destroyed. I don't know the woman so I can't speak on her behalf but mothers more often than not only want what they <em>think</em> is best for their children. Anyone with parents knows that what they <em>think</em> is best often isn't; they're not infallible, after all.</p>

        <p>I used to agree with you - even during the Trump years, when liberals were ruthlessly cutting conservative friends out of their lives. "We don't have to stoop to that level," I thought naively.</p>
<p>Well, 2020 changed my mind on all that. The idiocy, the human savagery has gone "hot". There is no reason to waste your time and energy on somebody who wants to restrict your basic human right of free movement, your right to breathe fresh air, your right of free assembly. Family or not, there's no excuse for that.</p>
<p>We are social animals and all this shit would be considered psychological torture by pre-2020 standards.</p>

        <p>I have purged people this year, more than others.  They were bullies, using you tube video to coerce me into believing covid was this horrible thing, other than the flu. That im irresponsible for not getting a vaccine.  The one I will not miss is an alcoholic telling me that I'm selfish for not wearing a mask around my house while he was there drinking.

        <p>Both parents locked my family out of their lives, essentially. I told them I was tired of dashing their grandchildrens' hopes of seeing them soon, and last time I spoke with my father he was all about getting the goddamn vaccine. He used to be my hero, despite all his flaws. It sickens me that he'd rather be scared shitless by a fucking weak-ass virus than see his grandchildren.</p>

        <p>Not sure. I think the reason they aren't spotting it is because its new propaganda. They wouldnt fall for Nazi propaganda now because they were taught in school that Nazis are bad. This is a new topic, so they werent taught to think its bad.</p>

        <p>Sort of. I recently told my boomer parents I won't be speaking to them again until this is all over. They believe "just a few more weeks!" (of masks and lockdowns). I very much doubt that, so I guess this is an indefinite goodbye.</p>
<p>I already disliked visiting them for other reasons (bad memories / poorly behaved dogs), but them making us all wear masks in the family home was just too much for me. Sorry, I'd rather not see you at all than be reminded how insane this world has become. Oh, the kicker? Not only are they both fully vaccinated, but both of them believe they contracted COVID many months ago. Even by their own standards they are zero at risk. But Fauci says those masks need to stay, so ...</p>
<p>They don't mind this lockdown at all. As I said to them during our last conversation/argument: what difference does it make to a 75-year-old? You just sit at home all day anyway, watching "The View" and refreshing your stocks to see how much money you made today, ordering multiple things from Amazon every day. How convenient! My father literally said to me, exasperated: "Why can't you just sit back and MARVEL at all these technological wonders?"</p>
<p>They voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020 (putting a political sign out in the yard for the first time in their lives). Might give you a bit of insight into their average boomer mentality. They want these lockdowns to continue as long as Fauci says, no matter how much their children and grandchildren have to suffer. They give zero fucks, as long as those sweet tech stocks keep raking in the cash, and Amazon keeps delivering on time.</p>

        <p>This is the sad state of boomers. Rather than seeing younger generations flourish by 1) not supporting lockdowns 2) sharing their wealth and being involved in the development of multi-generational projects, they choose to sit at home, eat sugar, watch TV, horde stocks or buy material shit, die alone.</p>
<p>I check in on my parents from time to time but they have become the picture of sloth and greed, and the "pandemic" has given them the excuse to indulge in this to an extreme. They will end up probably dying early from these indulgences, their "retirement" years nothing more than a prolonged binge and material wealth parade. It's sad, I see them light up when I talk to them, because I'm living an actual life and therefore have interesting things to talk about, am healthy and energetic etc. But it's completely one way and completely "altruistic" for me to bring this light to them, because they simply consume it and don't offer anything in return. They are really typically like black holes of self-indulgence and gluttony, just consuming and hoarding everything that they can. It's really sad to talk about them this way, I know there's something redeemable in them but they would have to discover it themselves. Anyone can drag themselves out of sin if they want to, it may be a long process but it can always be done and it's always a meaningful endeavor. I would maybe have a bit more capacity for talking to them once in a while if it weren't for having had to put my life completely on hold due to lockdowns. If only they and all boomers realized they could cure the emptiness by being generous and letting us younger people flourish.</p>

        <p>I can understand where your coming from completely as most of family are the same and are attacking me behind my back for not wanting the vaccine. Remember though this is what the governments want, they want divide and everyone to turn against each other. There plans will continue as long as we continue to hate each other, this has all been orchestrated on purpose for this very reason.</p>

        <p>I'm glad all my friends and family, and even most of my coworkers, are at least somewhat skeptical. Common consensus seems that even if you believe it's a dangerous virus, the government still took the controls too far and/or the approach to lockdowns was fundamentally wrong.</p>

The worst part is he knows somethings is wrong about the whole thing but follows the rules diligently because he has a small bubble of really close friends who will cut him off if he breaks rules too much.

My deluded sister claims to personally know 20 people under 60 that have died from Covid. Just for a laugh, I calculated the 'p' value for this scenario. So many, many zeros.

        <p>Sunshine, you must understand that TPTB wants family and social bonds to be destroyed. Forgive your mom and love her - think of her as a child who doesn't understand what's going on. She might be in Doomsville, but she does love you. If you are angry at your family members, then you're following the plan of TPTB. Speak to your mom and don't let anything come between you.</p>

        <p>I've lost a good friend but I didn't cut him out, he followed advice and stayed home. The rest of us continued meeting up for a smoke twice per week as we have done since school days and he stopped coming, we haven't seen him since February 2020. He's just been at home all the time.</p>

        <p>Well, I want to, but, they are really good people who treat me very well and im conflicted. Some of the best friends ive ever known so its hard. They don't try to get me to wear a mask or think like them about it so I appreciate that. They are not doomers or bullies.</p>

        <p>for me, its disappointment, mostly.<br>
I don't feel anger. and why would I?<br>
people make decisions based on their knowledge, or so I hope.<br>
my friends and family got fed the wrong information.</p>
<p>sure, I could blame them for letting it happen, but whats the point.<br>
what would that solve?</p>
<p>rather than being angry that they are still in my way I try to make them see clearly without being a dick to them.<br>
it worked for a few people already and I pretty much turned arround my entire offices opinion in this matter.</p>
<p>don't be angry. help her.<br>
tell her how its affecting her grandchildren and why its a problem.<br>
show her theres more to a healthy life then staying uninfected by a virus.</p>
