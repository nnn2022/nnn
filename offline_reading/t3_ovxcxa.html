    <strong>Apparently too unpopular opinion for r/unpopularopinion [Vaccine] [Opinion]</strong>
    <p><p>I guess this was too unpopular an opinion for even the r/unpopularopinion sub. Ive tried multiple times to share on that sub what is currently an unpopular opinion to allow/accept people to choose if they want to take the covid vaccine. Tried posting it.. my bad, was in a list of topics posted too frequently and they created a coronavirus megathread. Ok, so I posted the post as a comment there... No votes, no comments for hours... Come to find out its ghosted and doesnt appear under a private browser. its not approved to be shown. Anyways, censorship is great nowadays, isnt it!? Well here's my post of whats been on my mind trying to make sense of whats going on and hope it rings true to someone, or we can have a healthy discussion if the very least.</p>
<hr>
<p>People should be able to make their own risk/benefit analysis to choose to take the covid vaccine</p>
<p>In todays world as viewed on almost any media form (Ads, News, Soc Med, govnt) a very unpopular opinion. And might be rightly so, or might also be amplified by media/news/officials who are handing out pitchforks, lighters, rags, and gasoline. But quietly sits back and allows the mob to storm off on their war path to the next person found to have this view... "vaccinate!!! vaccinate!!! vaccinate!!!" Or our brothers and sisters across the pond "Get the jab!!! Get the jab!!! Get the jab!!!" But let's hope we can have a productive conversation here. </p>
<p>There are two competing context frames; what is best for the masses and what is best for the individual/family. In a simple hypothetical world, all else being removed, this would be an easy choice; choose whats best for the masses.</p>
<p>Except we dont live in a simple hypothetical world. Quite to the contrary, we live in a highly complex, highly complicated interconnected world. And in this hyper informationally saturated world, the true "Truth" is repackeged unto a loose "truth" handed by the group you choose. There is so much information, so much data, so many statisticts, so many opinions, so many articles, so many videos, so many forums, so many comments, so many replies, so many ideas, so many thoughts, so many "truths".</p>
<p>This is all staging to try to describe what is hard to put into words that is going on today with covid and the vaccine effort. The true Truth is to take a vaccine that uses fairly recent biotechnology, with presumed new mRNA payload aka CoV spike protein, that isn't perfect and may contain downstream seen and unforseen consequences, and doesn't completely protect you from getting and infecting others with covid, but does reduce major illness and death over a population, but only for a finite amount of time before you'll need a booster shot, and there are no signs (in this scenario) of us Not living with more variants that will need additional vaccine protection from. But... it will help the greater good!</p>
<p>Or, a responsible thoughtful individual who doesn't want to be patronized as though they are stupid and  who actually does care about the well being of those around them in their community; to be able to wash their hands, wear an N95 mask, socially distance, or pay the price of them falling ill or with their life. Make their own risk/benefit analysis if they arent interacting with many people and the risk of them catching covid is lower than the perceived and assumed risk outcomes of a new vaccine. Those vaccinated were recenly found to be able to spread covid in breakout cases and the reissuance of a universal mask mandate by the CDC (US) means mostly everyone is back on even footing for spread. So ultimately, a responsible person who follows the same health consideration are helping reduce spread just as much as a vaccinated person would. Comes down to do You want the chance of having a more serious time with covid, or less serious? The idea of "protecting others by being vaccinated" is fading quickly. Except now the roles appear to have reveresed from 1 year ago where those vaccinated are now the ones who don't want to wear a mask because they feel like a promise was broken. "Get your vaccine, and you can go back to normal". That no longer appears to be the case.</p>
<p>Quite a contrast for a price paid if any of the vaccine manufacturers are wrong. Are their lifes on the line if the vaccine is later found to cause serious long term harm? Are their money on the line? Are their jobs on the line? Is the company on the line? Here's a little tid-bit: Because the vaccine is under an emergency use authorization in time of a pandemic, there is 0 liability if they are wrong and there are serious long term effects. None, zero, zip, nada. No lawsuits can be filed, no claims, no monetary compensation required, no check no balance. Nothing. Nobody will have your back, except maybe a future reluctant and long overdue government issued "Were sorry we screwed you" fund, paid by the people's taxes you chose the better good for. But not from the ones that were fast, loose, reckless, and greedy, knowing they had a guaranteed get out of jail card, all the while raking in 7.8 Billion with a B in vaccine sales.</p>
<p>Booster shots anyone?</p></p>
