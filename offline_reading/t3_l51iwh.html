    <strong>[Rant] California is NOT reopening</strong>
    <p><p>I'm seeing all these headlines about Gavin Newsom "lifts stay-at-home orders for California", but a better headline would be "Gavin Newsom places 99% of counties back into most restrictive tier" which is actually what's happening.</p>
<p>What does this mean for me? Some more restaurants around me will be opening for outdoor dining (a lot were already doing outdoor dining anyway), which doesn't appeal to me much since its winter and it's been windy lately. And I can go get a haircut now. Whoop di doo.</p>
<p>All last week I see headlines about NY and DC and Michigan resuming indoor dining. I'm over here on the west coast, and I'm supposed to be happy that they're allowing outdoor dining now, as if that's some huge victory. It was absurd that they banned it in the first place, the fact that they're resuming it barely means anything to me.</p>
<p>Fuck Newsom. I'm pissed. How many more months of this shit am I going to have to put up with this? And don't tell me to move, it's not financially possible for me at this point.</p></p>
