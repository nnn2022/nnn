        <p>Remember that many of us on this sub weren’t always as skeptical on vaccines and Covid as we are now, even as otherwise intelligent critical thinkers. Just as we (well, some of us) give grace to people who come to this sub who’ve had a change of heart and mind, I think we should also give Grace to those who never got the chance to have that change. </p>
<p>I’m a bit closer to this story, so consider that Ayesha had asthma, her mother was a boomer doctor, and she was encouraged by “trustworthy authorities” to basically quarantine even more than the typical person in the NY/nj area because she was “at risk.” A big part of her life was traveling around the country doing lectures and events, along with dancing salsa. She went from that to being on lockdown and not being able to socialize in person. So yes, for her the vaccine seemed like a godsend to be able to get back to normal life. </p>
<p>Also, keep in mind that sometimes we can reach the wrong conclusions for the right reasons. She was skeptical of the media but thought that disinformation was being used to influence Black people to <em>not</em> get vaccines in order to disadvantage us. Given how much confusion there’s been around Covid, it’s easy to believe that (but i think had she been presented with the data we discuss everyday, she would’ve been cautiously receptive.)</p>
<p>Note that she did have an unusually high amount of lifelong allergies even to mundane things, so sadly, it could’ve been an unfortunate reaction… or it could’ve been linked to the vaccine.</p>
<p>Had to chime in since I’ve been processing her death the past couple of weeks and was caught off guard by such an insensitive comment when I expected that I might instead find thoughtful discussion of how the vaccine can amplify allergic reactions.</p>

        <p>&rt;Ms. Faines is best known as a panelist on “The Grapevine Show”<br>
on Youtube. She was a Yale University graduate <strong>and worked for</strong> <br>
<strong>mainstream media outlets WJXT4 News4Jax in Florida and My9TV/Fox in New</strong> <br>
<strong>York.</strong> She is also the founder of a website called “Women Love Power.” Ms. Faines appeared on Entertainment Tonight, MTV and lectured at universities. </p>
<p>Once again for everyone in the back: Live as a propagandist. Die as a propagandist.</p>

        <p>Actually, she made the decision to leave news media about a decade ago, pretty early in her career, because she didn’t believe in what was being reported and didn’t feel that it was contributing positively to society.</p>
<p>She was far from a propagandist. The past years of her life were spent spreading knowledge and research about ancient archetypes and modern issues of femininity. When she did appear as a commentator on MSM, she did so with that purpose of countering conventional wisdom.</p>

<p>The brief obit above doesn’t really do her justice. Above is a link about her life in her own words. I didn’t agree with her politically on all things but part of her life’s work was calling out and neutralizing propaganda, so I felt compelled to post</p>

        <p>The only claimed caused of death is anaphylactic shock due to life-long food allergies and you're claiming without any evidence that because she got a vaccination several months ago it must be linked to that?</p>
<p>This kind of spurious bullshit is what people use to disregard the reasoned arguments that should be the focus of skeptical enquiry.</p>
