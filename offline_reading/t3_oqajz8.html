    <strong>One powerful vaccine..</strong>
    <p><p>Out of all the vaccines we have taken in our lives...Tetanus, small pox, measles, mumps, polio, meningitis, H1N1, TB...I have never seen so much wishy washiness over a vaccine that says I have to wear a mask and socially distance even when fully vaccinated, that I could still contract or spread the virus even when fully vaccinated, never had to have a double shot, never been bribed by establishments to take the vaccine in order to win a car and/or cash prizes and frequent flyer points.</p>
<p>I never had to worry about cardiac issues and/or blood clots and sadly more! Didn't have to worry about death. I was never judged if I didn't take it. I was never discriminated for travel or other regular services. The vaccines I listed above never told me I was a bad person for not taking it.....or taking it for that matter. I have never seen a vaccine that threatened the relationship between a family member and/or a close friend.</p>
<p>Never have I seen it used for political gain. Never have I seen it used to persuade kids in favour of free ice cream. Then thereâ€™s mixing and matching different vaccine brands and told it's okay to do it one day and then told the next day to not do it...then on and off, on and off again and again....etc, etc. I have never seen a vaccine threaten someone's livelihood....job, school, etcâ€¦. I have never seen a vaccine that allows a 12 year old's consent supersede his/her parent's consent (that one alone blows me away).</p>
<p>So, after all I have said, can someone tell me how on God's green earth I am a racist and/or a conspiracy theorist? Non educated, non researched because I am not willing to take this vaccine? The vaccine that is still experimental and where the clinical trials won't be over for at least two years+ from now????</p>
<p>Finally, after all the vaccines (jab, shots) I listed above, I have never seen a vaccine like this one that discriminates, divides and judges a society. So much information censored, deleted and removed from the internet! So many doctors and scientists censored and forbidden to speak out or ask legitimate questions when what is being allowed or not allowed does not make sense! Particularly when it comes from main stream media.</p>
<p>This is one powerful vaccine. It does all these things that I mentioned and yet? It doesn't do the one thing it is supposed to do which is?</p>
<p>FIGHT OFF COVID!</p>

        <p>I fucking hated having my tetanus boosters, playing sports meant an occasional visit to hospital and each time it was for cuts they insisted on giving me a booster</p>
<p>They managed to hit the bone in my thigh every time, hurt like hell</p>
