    <strong>New Manager Trying To Get Me Fired</strong>
    <p><p>So we hired this new manager about 3 months ago and I’m not sure what happened over the course of 5 days but she seems to be having some decline in sanity that’s starting by trying to force me into submission or to leave altogether.</p>
<p>I work in food service and everyone knows I’m treating this whole situation as BS.  However, I know that our business is under lockdown rules so I respect rules such as social distancing, wearing my mask when customers aren’t around, and maintaining sanitized surfaces.</p>
<p>This manager had a freak out over the group chat saying how we’re not washing our hands enough and to not let customers wait inside the shop.  She wrote all this in the back area without confronting anyone.</p>
<p>Then I wake up to my day off to a written warning from her threatening termination for not complying with her rules.  The irony is that she doesn’t even follow her own rules.</p>
<p>I’ve watched her touch the heads of various utensils that are used in food prep after working on her laptop or touching her phone, let customers who she was chummy with chat with her for a prolonged amount of time (one customer didn’t even have a mask on), and pulls down her mask repeatedly and even hosted a dinner party for us when she first became manager.</p>
<p>She took away my shifts for this weekend and I answered her request for a meeting next week with HR.  I’m sorry for the rant but I’m just annoyed that this woman is targeting me despite not following her own rules while also relying on online communication when either one of us is at home instead of speaking to me directly like a grown adult (and mind you, she’s 15 years my senior).  </p>
<p>I’m sorry for the rant because I’ve been trying to be more positive amidst all of this but it’s frustrating that I’m being forced into compliance with a hypocrite.  Thanks for being the amazing people you are for seeing through the bs.</p></p>

        <p>It’s funny, I was joking about how she’s probably on her period.  But it made me think of my old job where my old manager was quite nice to me but she was only doing that because she was getting all the other female managers and some employees to turn on this one female manager to get her to leave (she ended up leaving...the country).  I’m just tired of this high-school level antics, like giving you the silent treatment and then lashing out over text, coming from grown adults. </p>
<p>The only female manager who was quite decent was during my college days taking on a student employment position but my money was also lining her pockets lol.</p>

        <p>No offense but in some ways it was only a matter of time</p>
<p>These sorts of people might actually have the sort of personality types that help them dominate</p>
<p>It’s not Charisma, it’s insistence and relatively subtle intimidation and probably knowing that she can get upper management to back her up and make her a mini dictator just by going on about COVID</p>
<p>Neither she nor upper management actually truly care about Covid</p>

        <p>No offense taken.  Maybe it’s the universe giving me the kick in the butt I need to get somewhere better.  I live in an east coast city where the majority of people are playing this game and I’m only more eager to find greener pastures.</p>

        <p>My sociology classes in college may have been full of SJW BS but things like how the wider society affects the individual or smaller areas hold some weight</p>
<p>Having a managerial class like her pop up will be inevitable even if you move out of the East Coast or go to places closer to the Red(RINO-lands)</p>
<p>They don’t have to have the majority of people actually supporting this stuff</p>
<p>They just have to be a relatively small percentage, the elites have to be on their side, they are very vocal and active near 24/7 and into inconsistently “micromanaging” and such</p>
<p>I’m lucky to be well-off and not be from a Western country where we have the same “shame” and self-hatred you guys got, I’m an anomaly amongst my family for being able to see this shit. My brother has had COVID for practically a month, didn’t exercise much since his own lockdown, sleeps till maybe 9am and sleeps in the afternoon and eats lots of junk food, barely does sunlight.....he STILL hasn’t had anything wrong with happen and this is his latest test where he was considered positive</p>

        <p>What you says makes sense.  In a way, I kinda curse myself for being argumentative since my co-workers who shut up and keep their head down will often have an easier time.  She literally told me how if I were to be reinstated, I’d be trained all over again...by who?  I’ve literally been the one whose been here the longest.  If there’s no escape for any of this, maybe I should just start an onlyfans or something (kidding!).</p>
<p>The “shame” that some Americans have for this country is ridiculous.  I was born here but my parents were immigrants and they are grateful with all the opportunities and riches that America was able to give to them.  America is home to amazing technological innovation, art and culture, and progress for human rights (I’ll get some fire for this).</p>

        <p>That shame is in part due to education and even entertainment(people are dumb or malleable enough to learn their stuff from watching fiction)being really abridged and at times purposely biased</p>
<p>When it comes to education, you can bet the average person barely knows or ever learned and remembers much in-regards to history, economics, sociology, philosophy and even the culture of their own people or others’</p>
<p>Hell, I used to think that Game of Thrones was a fully accurate depiction of feudalism and monarchism and religion, the Sept for one has pretty much nothing to do with the sciences when even ancient egyptian priests knew biology to varying extents</p>

        <p>I think that’s the thing, entertainment and story telling can give so much life to history and education when it might otherwise seem a bit...bland.  I remember taking a US history class in high school as a requirement but things unfortunately didn’t stick much.  What did stick were major themes though that got me fairly emotionally engaged.</p>

        <p>I really enjoyed this job to be honest until she situated herself in here.  Most of my coworkers are great and a lot of our customers are the sweetest people ever.  I was planning to leave in the spring when my lease ends so I could pack up and move somewhere without all these bs covid restrictions but maybe the plan is happening sooner than I expected.</p>

        <p>See this is why i only work for a male boss, been in my job now over 3 years with a male boss that hasn't enforced any of the bs aside from don't spit on each other. What i've found when working for women is you get two types; the bitch trying to copy a man but ends up being like yours or you get super lucky and get the mothering boss that treats everyone like they're her own kids. Going forward bro i'd advise only working for men as call me a sexist but men are more logical and reason based and women are more emotional. If you look into sexual interdynamics it's mentioned men have a sense of justice morale vs womens care based morality. Despite the equality bullshit men and women are not the same nor equal.</p>

        <p>I’d like to be PC too but there are even a large number of women who hesitate to work with other female managers too because of past experiences.  It almost sounds silly to say but it’s something I’ll be keeping an eye out for.</p>
