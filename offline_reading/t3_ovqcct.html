    <strong>Let me tell you about that time I tried to travel to Tanzania</strong>
    <p><p>A few years ago, I wanted to go climb the Kilimanjaro. As you might know, it is highly recommended that you get several vaccines before travelling to Africa because there are some potentially deadly diseases that haven't been eradicated there. So I went ahead and got vaccinated against hepatitis A and B, cholera, typhoid, yellow fever and a few others. So I say to the nurse: </p>
<p>"Finally I can go to Tanzania, this has always been my dream. Thank you for making me immune against those diseases".</p>
<p>So the nurse give me a funny look and says: "What do you mean, I made you immune?" </p>
<p>So, a bit puzzled, I reply: "Well... you just gave me all those shots, so now I'm immunized to all those diseases". </p>
<p>She replies: "Oh no no no. Those vaccines I gave you will only work if 80% of Tanzanians receive them too. Until then, I highly recommend you don't travel anywhere near Africa."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Has anything like that ever happened to anyone else?</p></p>

        <p>Same man. When I went to Iraq I got the anthrax vaccine but since all of Iraq isn’t vaccinated against it, it was pretty useless for me. Those damn Iraq’s are so selfish for not getting the vaccine for me.</p>

        <p>My brother has a pug and wanted to bring the dog to Thailand with him when he moved back. Thailand required all dogs to be vaccinated with a drug that I don't remember. The dog died on the table.</p>
<p>Now the funny part, if you have been to Thailand, you know that they have a crap ton of stray dogs. Thailand don't give 2 craps about dog and the sickness they could possibly carry.</p>

        <p>I took in a stray cat a few years ago. After a few weeks of good food and water, he plumped up and was nearly double in size! I took him to the vet, who recommended giving him all the shots at once. I obliged. Later that night, I found him limp on the couch with his eyes rolled back in his head. You ever pick up a limp cat? Very scary. I took him to an emergency after hours vet and the techs kept denying that there was any relationship between the shots he had and being sick. Gaslighting at its finest.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I had to go pick up the dog because my brother was unable to leave work.</p>
<p>The vet met me right in the lobby and threw all excuses at me,"I don't know what happened! I am sure I got the amount of drug correct! I even contact other vets to ensure I got the right amount!"</p>
<p>I just simply said sternly,"Shut the fuck up and show me the dog now." This is in front of all the other customers and workers.</p>
<p>I walked in the lab and she still got breathing tubes in. The vet tech said they are willing to cremate the dog for free. I said," Everything is going to be free."</p>

        <p>Sorry! Yes he did. Once the staff examined him and ruled out the shot, they said "there's really not much we can do for him except monitor him overnight". By this time several hours had passed since I picked him up limp, and he was now shivering in the metal cage. I took him back home with me so that at least if he was going to be not feeling good, he could do so in the comfort of home. By the next day, he was fine  Eventually, he grew to over 20 pounds and was spoiled for 7 more years. I would provide cat tax, but I don't have any pictures on this phone. He was a classic Maine Coon with the tiger stripes and white face and paws.</p>

        <p><strong>This is SO true.</strong> </p>
<p>Went there in the Army. Most Americans would not make it in Thailand simply because they would constantly be trying to "rescue a dog". LOL. Thailand is the only country I've been to where the dogs fear man, en masse. They are everywhere though! But, if they come near the Thais, they will kick and beat them. So the dogs linger on the periphery of everything, hoping for scraps. As American soldiers we tried to make friends with the dogs and feed them and the Thai people became very unhappy. Crazy, crazy inversion of what we know here.</p>
<p>Most Americans would have permanent mental health issues if they saw how the Far East treats dogs. I won't even get into Korea, because I was there too. </p>
<p>People really have no clue what they are saying when they try to equate cultures, thinking we are all the same around the world. This couldn't be further from the truth. But Americans want to "feel good" rather than ensure ensuing generations are as well positioned as we are now. </p>
<p>We are screwed and, for sure, our progeny.</p>

        <p>Before a trip to the Amazon, I learned I’d need a yellow fever vaccine, so I got it and had the shot recorded in a little yellow book (International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis). Funny that a vaccine passport is something that has been out there since the early 20th century, but now suddenly everybody is trying to “develop it” for COVID. Why not using an existing document? </p>
<p>No one checked that, no one cared. </p>
<p>An MD was very reluctant to give it to my 19 year old brother with some medical history of minor issues and we had to beg her to prescribe it.</p>

        <p>They don’t want a plain old paper document like the yellow fever certificate.  They want a digital version with a live database status check.  Once the infrastructure for that is in place it’s relatively easy to extend it to include social credit scores so they can prevent dissidents getting groceries, buses, trains, etc.</p>

        <p>This. The whole idea felt extremely dodgy from the beginning, considering that no vaccine passport was ever needed to be developed, because we have one.</p>

        <p>I took a few vaccines before travelling to Africa. Can’t remember which ones, but I think rabies and yellow fever were there. No one checked. I basically just forgot about that until I started being accused of being an “anti-vaxxer” conspiracy theorist. The intention was that it supposed to protect <em>me</em>, not the rest of Africa.</p>

<p>On topic, a friend of mine had to cancel his african trip because of how sick the yellow fever vaccine made him. </p>
<p>I’ve been to Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique, Tanzania and Kenya and have never had to get a shot to go there, so the people pretending vaccines for travel has always been a thing are liars... or they only travel to Liberia and Togo lol.</p>

        <p>I think people are mistaking “recommended” vaccines for “required”. I’ve been to a bunch of countries where I was told I “needed” the vaccine, but I’ve never had it checked. I think I still have an old crumpled piece of paper tucked away in my travel wallet that says I’ve gotten so and so shots, but I’ve never had to show it.</p>

        <p>That’s BS. Those vaccines do make you immune, they were developed for many decades with extensive research. Medics also receive a lot of them, for instance the Hep A and B shots and they do make you immune - the one against A for a life time, B for some years.</p>
