    <strong>Why is our attention focused on Covid?</strong>
    <p><p>There are about 22 million abortions a year, and yet we focus our attention on a disease that has killed 2,6 million. The despicable thing is that every single abortion is a choice to kill a child. Just let that sink in. We are more worried about Covid naturally killing people than people purposely murdering babies.</p></p>

        <p>I donâ€™t really get the hate for abortions. 
Like itâ€™s better to get rid of the fetus before it gains consciousness, instead of having a baby youâ€™re not ready for. Accidents happen.</p>

        <p>Well we live in invert world these days...good is bad, right is wrong</p>
<p>It's ironic that people say 'my body my choice' can't apply to vaccines because 'your not having a vaccine can affect others!' - what, and an abortion <em>doesn't</em>? An abortion is invariably fatal for one of the two bodies involved - one ain't making it out alive ðŸ˜”</p>
<p>As pro-Life as I am, I'm not sure this is a good argument though - far better to ask why are they not concerned with preventable cancer deaths, caused by missed screenings/almost non-existant GP appointments/halted treatments...why don't they care about the suicides that have happened and will continue to happen as a result of the restrictions? The children that will go to bed hungry because of the trashed economies and lost jobs?</p>
<p>Why is it all about those who have died from something with a 99.7% recovery rate unless you are on your last legs anyway?</p>
<p>The Government (at least here in UK) haven't given a flying f@#k about the elderly in decades...you have elderly having to choose between eating properly or not succumbing to hypothermia in their homes, yet now we are expected to believe they are trying to protect those same people? </p>
<p>Pull the other one, it's got bells on and whistles Dixie</p>
<p>Can't believe people are still falling for this</p>

        <p>I was actually thinking about this recently to myself. I'm a pro-life woman and have loathed the phrase "my body my choice" for a long time.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Doomers have used this as a "gotcha" against me at times, and while their arguments were plainly just to antagonize and im bad faith i can see their confusion how I can be "pro-LIFE" and also (in their eyes at least)  a murderer.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A few days ago i actually forced myself to rationalize this in my own head and I think i got there: It's  about choice and who gets to make choices and who is unable to choose or defend himself against tangible death rates. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>First lets talk about death rates: </p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of abortion according to planned parenthood the abortion pill is effective (meaning it results in the death of the baby) between 87 to 99 percent of the time depending on the week of gestation. An in-clinic procedural abortion is successful more than 99 out of a hundred times. So at all times more than 87% will die, usually more.  </li>
<li>It is almost unheard of for anyone,  even otherwise perfectly healthy babies with no detectable conditions,  to survive an abortion, and it only happens by accident or due to a medical fuckup. </li>
<li>In the case of covid the SURVIVAL rate is, for a majority of the population, over 98 precent. I calculated my own with <a href="https://qcovid.org/Calculation">this risk calculator</a> and my risk of being hospitalized is 0,0191% and my risk of death is 0,0003%. </li>
<li>It is exceedingly rare for any otherwise perfectly healthy human being with no other conditions to die of covid and if they do there is almost always a medical fuckup such as late detection ( or nurses too busy doing tiktok dances) </li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Clearly it is plain that one of these results in a higher chance of death of innocent people. </p>
<p>Now lets briefly talk about choice:  </p>
<ul>
<li>A foetus (or Baby as i like to call it)  has 0 choice in the Abortion choice. Absolute 0, zilch, nada. The pro-choicers say it isn't even a  human being so it gets no choice. Another person makes the choice for them whether they get to roll the dice on 87-99% certain death.</li>
<li>A  adult human (or even a child with basic mental capacity) if scared of the 0.0003 to 5% death rate,  has plenty of choice in the covid story.  They can take whatever precautions they like, including just not going outside their house, wash their hands, disinfect all surfaces, keep 6 feet away from other humans,  not recieving vistors at home or seeing firends, or going to restaurants etc, wearing as many masks as they like (i'm not out to  steal their masks ya know), wearing a face shield, wearing a hazmat suit, wearing a tinfoil hat, anything they like. There are sooo many things they can choose to undertake that means they wouldn't even have to freaking roll the dice of 0.0003 to 5% death at all, eliminating even that small risk. </li>
</ul>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm perfectly comfortable calling myself "pro-life" and also being anti-this-covid-bullcrap. Because they are not the same. Murdering babies with 95% certainty while giving them 0 choice is NOT i repeat NOT the same thing as MAYBE infecting someone who could take literally a dozen steps of their own with a virus that has 95% certainty of survival. </p>
<p>It's not a valid comparison.</p>
