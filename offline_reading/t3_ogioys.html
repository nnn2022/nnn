        <p>You can sue them. You just won't win.</p>
<p>In the US, this has been the case since the 80s. You have to take injuries through the no-fault federal vaccine court funded by a tax on vaccines. For covid, it's even worse. At least with traditional vaccines you had an avenue to get some compensation. It does not seem there is much of a path to pursuing any case for covid vaccine damages currently. It doesn't help that most of the medical establishment does not understand what they are doing and would dismiss your injuries as mere coincidence.</p>

        <p>Mostly because medically speaking, the adverse COVAX effects are in line with previous vaccine rollouts. If you look at data on the National institute of health’s website, previous vaccines have had pretty bad or even fatal side effects, in some cases (1976 swine flu vaccine for example:  life threatening effects in every 1/100,000, with 53 deaths recorded total. 45 million received said vaccine before it was stopped due to these side effects). The data is still running with the COVID vaccines, but it’s likely that bad side effects will effect a very small subsection of vaccinated population. The medical community accepts these deaths in the tens or hundreds amongst millions as coincidental, because they cannot reject or accept the vaccines as causal. It’s not that they are not causing these effects, it’s that there aren’t enough cases to establish vaccines as the cause. </p>
<p>This isn’t a new thing that relates particularly to the COVID vaccines. Vaccinations have been suspected of causing many different issues in the past, but there isn’t enough data to definitively say they cause those issues. At the end of the day, I had COVID, it wasn’t fun but I’m healthy and it didn’t really do anything. I also got the vaccine, also didn’t do anything, I feel fine. Odds are you probably have as much of a chance of getting hit by lightning as the vaccine killing you. If you don’t want to take that gamble, then don’t. Nobody should really care, covid is an overblown crisis.</p>

        <p>Wrong.  They've had immunity for decades even on the totally "safe" vaccines that have existed for almost 100 years.  Everything gets settled in a secretive style court.  Payouts so far are in the 10's of billions I believe</p>

        <p>Since it’s conception in 1986 it has paid out $4.4 billion. </p>
<p>“Compensation Program (VICP) in 1988 to compensate individuals and families of individuals injured by covered childhood vaccines.[2] The VICP was adopted in response to concerns over the pertussis portion of the DPT vaccine.[1] Several U.S. lawsuits against vaccine makers won substantial awards. Most makers ceased production, and the last remaining major manufacturer threatened to do so.[1] The VICP uses a no-fault system for resolving vaccine injury claims.[1] Compensation covers medical and legal expenses, loss of future earning capacity, and up to $250,000 for pain and suffering; a death benefit of up to $250,000 is available. If certain minimal requirements are met, legal expenses are compensated even for unsuccessful claims.[3] Since 1988, the program has been funded by an excise tax of 75 cents on every purchased dose of covered vaccine. To win an award, a claimant must have experienced an injury that is named as a vaccine injury in a table included in the law within the required time period or show a causal connection. The burden of proof is the civil law preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, in other words a showing that causation was more likely than not”</p>

        <p>For fully approved ones you have to go through the government compensation fund, but you won’t win. </p>
<p>For the most recent EUA ones, Trump and Co gave all the Warp Speed companies complete immunity. </p>
<p>There’s also news out of South America where Pfizer demanded sovereign assets to cover future legal costs because the countries wouldn’t give them immunity: https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/23/pfizer-plays-hardball-in-covid19-vaccine-negotiations-in-latin-america/</p>
<p>But they’re totally safe guys</p>
