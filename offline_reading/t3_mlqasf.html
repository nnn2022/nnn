        <p>No one’s really talking about it, but there’s a pretty big movement of church nomads in Los Angeles who are looking for a new home due to lack of activity during the pandemic.</p>
<p>A lot of churches went online only, which wouldn’t be so bad if we only wanted sermons. Before the lockdowns, I was a sunday school teacher who also helped out with recovery groups.</p>
<p>Watching a sermon online wasn’t fulfilling, so I found a church that serves the homeless with food and hygiene kits after in-person sermons on Sundays. They do grocery delivery for seniors a couple times a week and drop off blankets and leftovers at local parks. We’ve had a handful of folks we serve ask for help getting jobs, so they return during the week, we help them with their résumé and make sure they have clean clothes/transportation to the interview, and they’ve actually gotten the job!</p>
<p>On Sundays, I used to do food prep, but since I’m probably the most social of the group, I started hanging outside in line just talking and even praying for people who ask. The stories are heartbreaking - all it takes is a couple of missed paycheques and people are out on the streets. It’s important to remember that anyone can be homeless and everyone should be treated with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>After hearing so many stories, I’ve gotten more involved locally and have gotten to share some of the stories of those were deemed “nonessential.”</p>
<p>I would highly encourage everyone to get involved in their community at this time - we need it now more than ever!</p>
