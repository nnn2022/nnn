    <strong>I try to use art and writing to reach people where facts and logic fail. I wrote this using famous quotes from highly regarded people about freedom.</strong>
    <p><p>It is intendted to highly the absurd duality and double think we are  witnessing, where actual facts are lies and lies are facts and they  change and swap daily. How peole hold the like of mandella, bob marley,  lennon and orwell whom i quoted as visionaries and simultanelously do  everything they warned against.  Where fear has become a virtue and freedom a vice. </p>
<p>Existence undefined</p>
<p>Ignorance is wisdom; tis folley to ask why,</p>
<p>In the kingdom of the blind, The one eyed man spreads lies.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The more they know for sure, the less they need to see,</p>
<p>Better live in  prison,  than dream of being free.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Great glory to the one, who in life never falls,</p>
<p>By never rising up, through this world he crawls.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Careful not to wish, they get all that they dreamed,</p>
<p>Ignorance their strength, the clock strikes thirteen,</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As slaves live free in peace, they wage an endless war,</p>
<p>No longer in their world, does two plus two give four.</p></p>
