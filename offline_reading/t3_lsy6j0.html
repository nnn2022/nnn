    <strong>No One Cared About the Immunocompromised Until The TV Said So</strong>
    <p><p>Hey all. Small rant.</p>
<p>Alrighty guys, so I have an autoimmune condition that, along with the medications I take, ensure that I have next to no ability to fight off infections of any kind. All my doctors told me that for the rest of my life, I have to watch out for anyone that may have the flu, or any contagious disease, as I'm much more likely to 1) contract said disease and 2) develop extreme complications because my body is actively repressed in its ability to fight off disease (if it isn't, my body will attack itself, and that's no fun).</p>
<p>I was diagnosed with this condition at 17, I am now 25. I've been social distancing myself from crowds of people and anyone with the sniffles since before social distancing was even called that.</p>
<p>Let me cut to the chase here. To everyone that capes for mask mandates and lockdowns in the defense of me and people like me, fuck you. You never cared about us before the TV told you to. </p>
<p>You feel that fear? Fear that someone's spittle getting on to your face or skin might put you in the ER? That if you're breathing the same air as someone else in the room, you might catch God knows what?</p>
<p>I've been living with that for the last 8 years, and will have to live with it for the rest of my life. Never ONCE did I ask someone to put on a fucking mask, if someone had the sniffles, guess what I've done and will continue to do? Walk the fuck away!</p>
<p>So fuck you and fuck your need to control everyone around you. You fucking doomers are finally experiencing/understanding the fear that comes with being immune compromised, and you use that to shut down family businesses? To line the pockets of megalithic corporate interests? To have cops beating children in public for not wearing masks?</p>
<p>Fuck you. This was never about making people like me safe, it was about making people like YOU feel like you're making a difference. Well, you are, and it's not a good one.</p>
<p>Edit: and I stopped wearing a mask, because I realized the world is just as dangerous for me as it was pre-2020. I didnt let the fear get in the way of me breathing back then, and I won't let it do the same now. Shit, I got a 96% chance of surviving according to the CDC, so I'll take my chances.</p>
<p>Post edit: so on rereading this post, I realize I'm coming mad aggressive at the start by saying fuck you to everyone that supports the lockdowns. It goes against some principals of mine that generally not everyone in any given demographic is out to do their opposites harm, that there are lots of genuinely good hearted people that just got caught up in the mainstream media hype. I do not mean any kind of negative energy towards you if this identifies you, I just wanted to convey the hurt and frustration of this continued imposed victimhood, and how exhausting it all is from the other side of the spectrum. That said, my b for generalizing the entire demographic that supports/enforces lockdowns, there are just so many louder, consistent voices in the media and in public than there are that simply wish to get on with their lives safely for their family's/personal sake.</p>
<p>We can't be mad at the other side for generalizing us in negative ways,  then ignore when we do it ourselves. Gotta do it fairly when criticizing an opposing ideology. That said, yall have a good one one and be safe.</p></p>

        <p>My aunt is immunocompromised from lupus drugs. She's no more wary than she was before. My mom went through chemo late 2019 and despite getting it during her recovery phase she survived just fine.</p>
<p>I have multiple friends who are COPD or ARDS sufferers, they got it. Survived.</p>
<p>Two very heavy smokers I know got it. Hospitalized, but survived. A guy receiving chemo for unspecified cancer I know got it. Survived.</p>
<p>I'm seeing a pattern here.</p>

        <p>Immunocompromised here with a lung disease &amp; 3 neuro conditions &amp; not one person gave a shit before this. In fact, I was mocked online by a "friend" &amp; people complained behind my back about my coughing. I snapped one day &amp; said "well I'm sorry my lung disease bothers you more than it bothers me" &amp; turned my back.</p>
<p>The virtue signalers don't give a shit. Never have, never will.</p>
<p>Still won't wear a mask due to a skin disease &amp; nerve condition that affects my face. You wanna wear a mask, go for it. I also refuse to stay home 24/7.</p>

You won't confront anyone not wearing a mask. You might mumble under your breath but other than that you won't do shit. You're a couple of replies from switching to all caps, lol!

        <p>You were the first to show malicious intent for a completely normal activity, walking around with a human face. You're threatening to end someones life for a virus you have to be tested for to even know if you have it. Even the WHO has said asymptomatic spread is at 0.7% yet you're acting like it's ebola. </p>
<p>Gross negligence is driving in a crowded supermarket parking lot at 55 mph. Shooting someone for not wearing a mask will get you locked up for a considerable amount of time and NO judge would agree that your life or you family members life was at any risk justifying that action. Yes you're a psycho.</p>

<p>My partner is immunocompromised and regardless of the lack of media attention before, we are both very thankful that the majority of people are wearing masks during this pandemic. If anything, it is bringing more visibility to the struggles immunocompromised people face.</p>

        <p>Dying WITH covid is not the same as dying FROM covid. A positive PCR test doesn't mean covid killed you.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>US flu cumulative hospitalizations in 2017-2018 flu season: 710,000</p>
<p>That was just one flu season- BEFORE everything was called Covid-19.</p>
<p>Now, with every hospital visit being called a covid visit:</p>
<p>https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_coronavirus_hospitalizations</p>
<p>It's at 853,414. And we all know that's over-inflated, includes every common cold and influenza, and is spread WELL OVER 1 flu season.</p>
<p>Influenza in Bolivia is the number one killer every single year.</p>
<p>Stop telling me to be afraid of something that's WAY less deadly than the flu. Covid isn't shit.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWNkJUDctdk</p>
<p>Watch this video. PCR test is a farce and should never be used to determine the existence of covid-19.</p>
<p>The New York Times: PCR is giving 90% false positives.</p>

<p>All these are influenza cases causing hospitals in UK to be overrun BEFORE 2020</p>

<p>All different years. Someone even posted a collage of headlines dating back 8 years and every single one had flu cases overrunning hospitals.</p>
<p>At the bottom of this page, you'll find a download link for an excel spreadsheet that gives the number of pneumonia / influenza deaths at each medical or nursing home facility in the UK from 2015 to 2017. It's quite a lot. Breaks it down by sex and age. This is way before covid so again, you cannot blame all this on covid or pretend it never happened before covid.</p>

<p>and</p>
<p>In 2018 alone, pneumonia killed 800,000 children, and while deaths from other infectious diseases, including malaria, diarrhoea are falling, fatal pneumonia cases are declining at a much slower pace. </p>
<p>https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/11/1051161</p>
<p>Not everyone lives in the United States.</p>
<p>And the CDC is under a lawsuit for violating federal law and inflating Covid deaths by up to 1,600% based on this study:</p>
<p>https://medicalkidnap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/CDC-Illegal-COVID-Deaths.pdf</p>
<p>It's been called out several times last year for inflating numbers. This is nothing new.</p>
<p>Sorry, but calling every single death a covid death is pretty fucking lame. I don't submit to fear porn.</p>
<p>Watch some of this doctor's videos. Check out her book.</p>

<p>Illinois Head of the Department of Public Health states that if there is a positive PCR test, the death is recorded as a covid death no matter what. She says this in her own words to the camera in a video.</p>
<p>Dr. Birx says the same thing:</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGHp1GdOD4k</p>
<p>Deborah Leah Birx is an American physician and diplomat who served as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator under President Donald Trump from 2020 to 2021</p>
<p>She's on video stating this. You can't disprove this.</p>
<p>That is not accurate reporting of covid deaths. And if you think that it is, just end this conversation now because we have nothing more to say to each other.</p>

        <p>Apparently it's just a coincidence that deaths from all causes increased all over the world in 2020, by nearly 18% in the U.S., and the months with the greatest increases correspond to the months with the greatest number of reported Covid deaths.  Meanwhile the numbers of deaths last January and February were totally normal.</p>
