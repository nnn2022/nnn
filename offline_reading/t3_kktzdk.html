<title>President Trump: The lockdowns in Democrat run states are absolutely ruining the lives of so many people - Far more than the damage that would be caused by the China Virus. Cases in California have risen despite the lockdown, yet Florida &amp; others are open &amp; doing well. Common sense please!</title>

        <p>This is the most based thing Trump has ever said. </p>
<p>In 10 years or so, after the media has put out story after story revising the covid death count down and increasing the death toll of lockdowns, people will look at this and wonder why they didn't agree with it at the time... much like with 9/11 and the Iraq War...</p>

        <p>Yeah, and then the great shift of people who were totally down with restrictions saying "well, yeah I really didn't agree with them the whole time. I just went along with it". Anything to be validated</p>

        <p>The reason why I keep my facebook archives (because those can be downloaded) is so that in a few years when people look back at this and regret it, I'm going to give the day and the date (early into the pandemic) when I predicted <em>to the fucking letter</em> all the violations of civil liberties and all of the mess they were eventually going to cause.  </p>

        <p>Oh we will definitely be on the right side of history. </p>
<p>When has freedom EVER been on the wrong side of history? When have people fighting against government overreach EVER looked bad from the lens of 50 or 100 years later? </p>
<p>The only possible example I can think of is segregationists fighting against government restrictions that forced businesses to allow service to everyone. AND those same people were ALSO wanting to government to, at the same time, MANDATE segregation. So I'm going to call that one a wash. </p>
<p>Freedom, and rational thought ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS win in the long run.</p>

        <p>They will never admit anything. A large percentage of people live to make other people as miserable as them and societies that prosper are the ones who can overcame and marginalize those people, while the ones who allow them to take over will fail. It is a constant and unending battle.</p>

        <p>What I fear is the possibility of 'climate lockdowns'. A staggering portion of the general public has been conditioned to uncritically accept anything 'The Science' demands, all for a virus that for all intents and purposes people don't see the actuall effects of. It's not a stretch of the imagination to assume the same bullshit won't be applied to a 'climate crisis'. Get ready to be herded into the cities, housed in dormitories the size of skyscrapers,  and fed bug gruel. And if you object, you're a science-denying moron who's selfish desire for 'personal property' will doom humanity to extinction!</p>

        <p>Forgoing the alarmist hyperbole, I'd wager it'd resemble wartime rationing. Probably a sharp increase on property taxes on single-family houses to 'incentivize' people into moving into apartments. Sharp increases on sales tax for all sorts of consumer goods that involve actual ownership, push people towards renting shit.</p>

<p>Personally I'm in favour of higher sales tax, higher property tax (even though I'm a homeowner myself), along with a reduction of the income tax (yeah right), but for other, more ideologically based reasons (geolibertarianism).</p>

<p>The next version of COVID might not be more deadly in and of itself, but because we somehow developed this idea of being obsessively clean to prevent the spread that people have no longer functional immune systems.  </p>
<p>And worse is how the news will spin it: that we must lock down even harder this time.  And they will never, ever admit that our response to COVID was the wrong one.</p>

        <p>I'm a bit more hopeful. Vietnam and the Gulf War didn't teach the US not to invade other countries for a pointless reason. But the blatant lies around Iraq did. There hasn't been an Iraq style war started in 17 years.</p>
<p>Conflicts that the US has been involved with since Iraq have been winnable conflicts with a clear mission on a much smaller scale. </p>

        <p>&rt;He's much better than what the media's portrayed him to be during the past 4 years.</p>
<p>I keep saying it and it's true: he's been a cultural staple since I was a child (I'm over the age of 40).  He was seen as an aspirational figure by many for a very long time.  He had his own TV show...and somehow no scandal ever broke out around him back then when it for damn sure could have?</p>
<p>This idea that Donald Trump is the embodiment of - coincidentally - every single bad thing that the Social Justice mob rallies against just seemed too terribly convenient, and yet, people bought it hook line and sinker.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm not even saying I think he's a good person.  I don't doubt he's got bodies hidden somewhere (literal or figurative).  Just that he's been made out to be a cartoon villain and it makes me wonder how people have no cultural memory of this man before 2016.</p>

        <p>We will see. If the election is successfully stolen, the Republic is dead. If we get to the point where presidential elections are blatantly stolen then whatever we had before is no more, and it will be time to think about leaving.</p>

        <p>If there is no resistance, those who want any chance at living outside the new normal, outside the NWO, outside the USSA will have no choice but to flee. And remember that time may be limited. There will be a brief window where it has become obvious that the nation as we know it is lost. That the forces of evil, control, totalitarianism have won. When that becomes apparent, and of there is no successful/significant resistance to join, we may need to leave.</p>
<p>Where? You're right that's tough.</p>
<p>Some suggestions: If you have money, Singapore would be a good option. The concept of freedom in Asia is different then our own. A strong independent city state whose value as a trusted financial cente largely ensures it's protection. The large powers benefit from it's existence. It's status as a wealthy, safe nation that respects the rule of law and enforces contracts fairly make it valuable as a neutral ground for business between other nations and other nation's citizens and businesses. An American and Chinese businessman can conduct their affairs under Singaporean law and no they will receive fair treatment from the governing authorities.</p>
<p>Also if you have money, Switzerland. For reasons that should be obvious, but I could discuss if anyone wants.</p>
<p>If you're an average Joe. Honestly somewhere poor but relatively safe where your limited assets will go far. The rural areas of some Southeast Asian nations could be very appealing. Life in rural Laos or Cambodia or Thailand will simply go on as it has for centuries. It will be hard for the NWO to enforce their new normal far from major population centers. And why would they try. The people there have nothing for them to take. A modest house somewhere near the mekong sounds very appealing right now. You may not be free in theory, but you'll be free in practice.</p>
<p>Brazil seems pretty resistant to this lockdown bullshit, possible option. Possibly other parts of South America.</p>
<p>Also some Eastern European nations are standing up to the bullshit. Croatia, Belarus, Poland, Hungary.</p>

        <p>Russia. Pro Christian pro family nationalistic. Freedom is great but now we are down to choosing between unfree options and I'd rather choose the tyrant who wants me to flourish so he can be enriched than ones who want to crush me underfoot.

        <p>I really hope your right. I have never known more "regular, everyday people" who are completely fed up. I hope Trump understands the power he has. If he comes out a few days before the inauguration, presents the evidence that 17 sovereign states wanted to prevent in the Supreme Court and that has been presented in hearings in many states, and simply asks his supporters to come to Washington immediately to prevent the destruction of our nation and reverse this blatant fraud, we will win. He has a huge number of real Americans ready to fight and die to prevent this illegal takeover of our nation by the NWO. All they need is a leader to call them up.</p>
<p>The nation is broken. The divide is too deep now. If it's going to start, I hope it starts with our guy in the whitehouse, not the puppet of those who seek to tear this nation down.</p>
<p>But he's running out of time. The Supreme Court is despicably afraid to hear a case brought by 17 sovereign states against the 4 who stole the election. They know if that evidence was presented, with Ted Cruz arguing no lesd, they would have had no choice but to rule in favor of Texas and the others. They would have bern forced to declare the election a fraud. The NWO has something on Roberts. And a couple of others. Only explanation. Disputes between the states need in something as important as this neec to be heard. Especially when 17 sign on and the stakes are so high. The Court is no longer legitimate.</p>
<p>This leaves it to the Senate and House. They need to challenge these slates of invalid electors and pull out all the stops to prevent this coup from occurring. If they fail, there is one man left who can stop it. And about 100 million behind him. When the courts have failed, the States have failed, and now the national legislature has failed, we are left with the final and fundamental source of legitimate political power: We The Sovereign People of The United States of America, and our legitimate leader President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>He may or may not take office, but if he does just ignore that shit. It is blatantly unconstitutional, and a lot of court cases against these tyrant governors are being won. Court cases take time, but we will eventually be free of this infringement on our rights. At least, I hope that happens anyway. If it doesn't, just ignore the mandates.

        <p>&rt;or the governors finding ways around the rulings so they can continue enacting restrictions.</p>
<p>This part is definitely true. For instance in Michigan, the State Supreme Court ruled against the governor, because the law granting the power to declare a state of emergency has limitations, it only lasts so long and the court ruled she can't keep extending the duration. She straight up said in a press conference she would be ignoring the decision and going ahead with more covid restrictions.</p>
<p>A few court cases regarding the closing of churches have also been won, I think in New York and California if I remember correctly. The restrictions ordering churches to close were ruled unconstitutional. I think there have been other cases I can't remember off the top of my head, and keep in mind the appeals process. It will all eventually go to SCOTUS, then we will see.</p>

<p>Remember everyone, Republican/third-party voters aren’t human, and people not locking down are killing your grandma. This makes it “OK” to airstrike them. Same reason it was “OK” to airstrike civilians in the middle east for 30 years straight, ya know, the greater good and all :)</p>

        <p>The point being, people saying this shit vote. </p>
<p>And if our federal government were to say...launch a hellfire missile to kill an “alt-right terror cell leader” and kill 10 children in the process...they really wouldn’t care. The children probably would have been “Trumpers” in the future or, god forbid, Republicans. Their sacrifice is for the greater good of the US. 10 children die, so 10,000,000,000 grandmas can live another year :)</p>

        <p>Trump was right about the correct strategy after the cat wat out of the bag. His appointee Dr Atlas was the only American health officer who was making any sense when talking about covid.</p>
<p>Florida is a very interesting case. Their cases kept going up for three uninterrupted months since the beginning of October, yet the number of deaths increased only between the middle of November and December, and have been going down for the last weeks. A clear case of casedemics.</p>
<p>South Dakota with their steady decline in cases and deaths is another example of the natural dynamics of the epidemics.</p>

        <p>It's called socialism and it's already everywhere in pieces, including your post. Your 401k is socialism - you're not paying taxes on your deduction or gains until much later and in a lower bracket. That means other people's taxes are making up for it now.</p>
<p>So I think you are trying to draw an arbitrary line where you think there is too much socialism. Communism is just a scare word that works on sheep.</p>

<p>Gonna have to disagree with you there. Paying less taxation on your own earnings is not socialism.</p>

<p>If there's one thing that I hope happens because of all of this, it's that a lot of underground entertainment is going to happen that doesn't have to follow all the regulations, and in doing so, turns the Hollywood model of recycling everything on its head.</p>
<p>"Hey listen, Hollywood, you can't dictate what everyone is supposed to like.  You need to let it grow organically.  Oh sure, you can pilfer from the stuff that people are responding to without your say so, like you used to, but nobody's buying your over-warmed bullshit anymore."</p>

<p>He was never what the media made him out to be from 2016 onward.</p>
<p>My theory on that is: it's precisely because he was a Washington outsider that he needed to be annihilated.  No one that couldn't be controlled could ever hold the position of President.</p>

        <p>I don’t give a fuck what the trump haters think, he could tell them them cancers bad and that would all take up smoking. He could get the 60% of this country that supports him to do a lot more to resist. I know a lot of people that support trump but think this whole thing is real just because of what he said.</p>

<p>He gets called xenophobic and paranoid by several people in the democratic party.  This can be looked up on Google very easily.</p>
<p>January 31: CNN "As the Coronavirus spreads, fear is fueling racism and xenophobia"</p>

<p>March 4: CNN Anderson Cooper tells people to be more concerned about the flu than the coronavirus.</p>
<p>March 9: Forbes states, "Covid-19 travel update: Fauci says cruising is ok if you are healthy."</p>
<p>President Trump sent a Naval Hospital Ship to New York and California.  He had an emergency medical facility built in New York with over 2,000 beds.  He shipped over a thousand ventilators to New York.  Governor Cuomo announced on the air publicly that he would flat out refuse any and all help from Trump and he was true to his word- he didn't use ANY of that.  He instead signed executive orders along with the governors in Michigan, New Jersey, and a few other Democrat States that forced nursing homes to keep all covid patients indoors instead of sending them to hospitals.  This caused tens of thousands of deaths!</p>
<p>But yeah, keep blaming Trump for this.</p>

        <p>Really good post.  If Trump takes action, he's a dictator.  If he doesn't take action, he's negligent.  If he sounds the alarm he's fear mongering, if he says don't panic, he's complicit.  If he suggests Hydroxychloroquine might help, suddenly it's a deadly drug even though it has been perfectly safe for 70 years.  Dude gets hit every day in every way.  Meanwhile Cuomo, Newsome and a few others force Covid patients into nursing homes, likely killing thousands.  The media? ................. crickets.</p>

        <p>He did take action.  The 'experts' told him we needed ventilators, he provided them. Same thing with hospital beds.  He shut down flights from China, they called him xenophobic but he did it because it made sense.  He set up a task force etc.  In fact, even Newsome and Cuomo and some other people who are normally 'enemies' praised him at the time for giving them everything they asked for.</p>
<p>I didn't say the media might say bad things.  I said that no matter what he does the media says bad things.</p>

        <p>The media has been shitting on Trump with lie after lie for 4+ years.</p>
<p>So there is no excuse for him to say right things and do the right actions to appease the media, they'll smear him anyways.</p>
<p>Look at 2020, most of that is due to Trump's emergency declaration. He's responsible for the biggest disaster in American history in generations. The most loss of freedom, destruction of small business, etc. Oh but it's not his fault. It's the fault of people he gave power to, and refuses to take back.</p>
<p>"I can reopen the economy at any time, I have absolute authority" - Trump March 2020 after closing the economy.</p>
<p>Still waiting...</p>
<p>Face it, Trump is just an actor for the globalists, same with Q/Flynn/Jones etc. I don't like it either, and I'll gladly retract all that if they prove otherwise.</p>

        <p>If that's an accurate quote then that's just Trump bloviating again.  I don't know what he meant by it, if in fact he did say it (it <em>sounds</em> like something he'd say to be fair).  So assuming he did, then I disagree, kind of.  As you know he's not the king, nor even a dictator, he's only President of a very large country with many levels of government.  He <em>might</em> be able to EO something along those lines, it's hard to say.  I also disagree(d) with him every time he says his actions 'saved millions' of lives.  At the same time I don't really blame him for trying to promote himself that way.  God knows the MSM never would.  Nor give him any credit for what he <em>has</em> done, or even what he tried to do.</p>
<p>Speaking of giving credit, I think I might have misconstrued your original reply to me.  If so, sorry about that.  I think we might be on the same page.  I think two things happened:  1; They finally found Trump's Achilles heel (he's a known germaphobe) and 2; They forced his hand into a political one by creating mass fear and panic in the populace.  He had to walk a fine line, i.e. appeal to his base while at the same time not further alienate the people who hate him.</p>
<p>I'm interested in your take on these things.</p>

        <p>Possibilities:</p>
<p>1 - Trump was legit until 2020 they finally got him under control with threats (most likely imo)</p>
<p>2 - Trump had some deal he could do whatever he wanted until the "one favor" (pandemic)</p>
<p>3 - Trump has been fooling us all along and is a very brilliant actor (unlikely)</p>
<p>4 - Trump is really legit and just overpowered by deep state including military (but then he should go on TV and tell us the truth)</p>
<p>5 - Trump is really legit but is surrounded by a bubble of misinformation and can't get out (making him basically an idiot because any one of us can figure things out)</p>
<p>6 - Trump is really fooling everyone and waiting for the last minute to pull a super-genius plan to destroy globalists (hope so)</p>
<p>Trump's phone call capitulation to the globalists that make #1 most likely (after a half minute or so it starts here):</p>

        <p>&rt; NYT January 8th: "There is no evidence that the virus is readily spread by humans"
&rt; WHO January 14: On Twitter "Peliminary investigations have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan, #China</p>
<p>Early on and based on reporting from China who was covering it up (like Trump did).</p>
<p>&rt; January 21: We get the very first reported coronavirus patient reported in the US: CDC
&rt; 
&rt; January 22: Dr. Fauci told Newsmax's Greg Kelly, "This is not a major threat to the people of the United States and this is notsomething that the citizens of the United States should be worried about right now."
&rt; 
So Fauci, in a qualified response said, don't worry "right now;" "you need to take it seriously;" and although "this is not a major threat,"  keep an ear open to the CDC and Homeland Security.  - https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/apr/29/steve-bannon/did-fauci-tell-us-not-worry-about-coronavirus/
&rt; January 26: Dr. Fauci again, this time in an interview with John Catsimatidis. "It's a very, very low risk to the United States"</p>
<p>Full quote "What can you tell the American people about what’s been going on?" Catsimatidis asked. "Should they be scared?"</p>
<p>"I don’t think so," Fauci said. "The American people should not be worried or frightened by this. It’s a very, very low risk to the United States, but it’s something we, as public health officials, need to take very seriously."</p>
<p>&rt; January 28: BuzzFeed News, "Don't worry about the Coronavirus. Worry about the Flu."</p>
<p>Again, very early in our knowledge. Even this article goes in depth about how little we know about how it spreads. The article's main takeaway is that spread outside of China had been minimal, and flu was a bigger danger at the time.</p>
<p>&rt; January 31: Vox News on Twitter "Is this going to be a deadly pandemic? No."</p>
<p>retracted two months later: https://twitter.com/voxdotcom/status/1242537366620966912</p>
<p>&rt; January 31: The Washington Post, "How our brains make Coronavirus seem scarier than it is"</p>
<p>Kind of a running theme here, but these were all based on lack of information at the time. Hindsight is 20/20. We don't know if Trump knew at this time even. He claimed in his Woodward interview that he knew in February.</p>
<p>&rt; Janurary 31: Trump, in direct defiance to the liberal media, liberal politicians, and WHO, begins blocking travel to and from China.
&rt;
&rt; He gets called xenophobic and paranoid by several people in the democratic party. This can be looked up on Google very easily.
&rt; </p>
<p>Because it never was a true travel ban. It was a ban on Chinese and foreign nationals. It also didn't stop travel from zones like Hong Kong and Macau that Chinese nationals had access to. Screening and quarantining returning travelers would have been a more effective tactic. I'm not sure if we were fully aware of that at the time. I don't necessarily find fault with the travel ban, but I think in retrospect it wasn't the super move Trump claims it to be.</p>
<p>&rt; January 31: CNN "As the Coronavirus spreads, fear is fueling racism and xenophobia"</p>
<p>What's new? Trump flipped after he <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/trump-praises-xi-for-handling-of-coronavirus-outbreak-as-death-toll-passes-600/">praised China's initial response</a>. Then it was China China China from <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=china%20trump&amp;geo=US">March-June</a></p>
<p>&rt; February 2nd: NYC Health Commissioner "...the risk to New Yorkers for Coronavirus is low and our city preparedneess is high. There is no reason not to take the subway, not to take the bus..."</p>
<p>Cases started ramping in NY in mid-march. They weren't wrong at the time. Things change.</p>
<p>&rt; February 3: The Washington Post, "Why we should be wary of an aggressive government response to Coronavirus"</p>
<p>This is a pretty even heeled concern about government overreach. They even mention the non-compliance that heavy-handed tactics can cause. Unfortunately we had to experience them here due to incorrect early messaging, and continued misinformation. In fact it covers that xenophobia you were so concerned about in prior dates.</p>
<p>&rt; February 5: The New York Times, "Who says it's not safe to travel to China? The Coronavirus travel ban is unjust and doesn't work anyway."</p>
<p>Opinion piece suggesting shutting down travel is a mistake. Seeking treatments, countermeasures, and vaccines being the better alternative. It's a nice idea I suppose. We did those things too though, and they weren't enough to control the initial outbreaks while treatments were developed. Minimizing or eliminating travel is straightforward and easy to enforce compared to the alternatives though.</p>
<p>&rt; On February 24, Pelosi told people that Chinatown was safe and that she hoped people would come to hang out. She and everyone else was there without masks and told people to come join her.</p>
<p>Another example of early messaging being wrong or bad. Here's what <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1232058127740174339">Trump had to say on that same day</a></p>
<p>&rt; February 26: New york Times "Let's call it Trumpvirus. If you're feeling awful, you know who to blame."</p>
<p>Another opinion piece. Seems to point out Pence's appointment to handling the covid response. More of Trump downplaying it at a time when he claims he knew how serious it was. Clickbaity title with not a lot to actually support the premise (because we didn't know Trump was downplaying it yet).</p>
<p>&rt; March 2: Bill de Blasio on Twitter, "Since I'm encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives + get out on the town despite Coronavirus, I thought I would offer some suggestions. Here's the first: thru Thurs 3/5 go see "The Traitor" u/FilmLinc. If "The Wire" was a true story + set in Italy, it would be this film.
&rt; 
&rt; March 2: NY Governor Andrew Cuomo, "...when you're saying what happened in other countries vs. what happened here, we don't even think 
it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries."</p>
<p>This is probably about the time NY should have known things were getting serious. Two weeks later is when cases began spiraling. Can only say this with the hindsight we have now though.</p>
<p>&rt; March 4: CNN Anderson Cooper tells people to be more concerned about the flu than the coronavirus.</p>
<p>This was a segue into flu vaccine awareness. At the time it was also true. Flu is more of a known quantity, and we have regular vaccines available that have the potential to reduce yearly case load and deaths. In the same segment they Sanjay Gupta points out covid's higher fatality rate, but the flu's rate is something we have a strong ability to influence.</p>
<p>&rt; March 9: Forbes states, "Covid-19 travel update: Fauci says cruising is ok if you are healthy."</p>
<p>Headline isn't a full quote. He said "young and healthy". Article is very focused on the economic impacts of telling people to avoid travel, doesn't address disease spread. This is still just before the major outbreaks.</p>
<p>&rt; President Trump sent a Naval Hospital Ship to New York and California. He had an emergency medical facility built in New York with over 2,000 beds. He shipped over a thousand ventilators to New York. Governor Cuomo announced on the air publicly that he would flat out refuse any and all help from Trump and he was true to his word- he didn't use ANY of that. He instead signed executive orders along with the governors in Michigan, New Jersey, and a few other Democrat States that forced nursing homes to keep all covid patients indoors instead of sending them to hospitals. This caused tens of thousands of deaths!</p>
<p>What's missing? Trump boosts hydroxychloroquine before a clinical trial.  Federal supplies became a mini-scandal of their own with absurd bidding and political ploys. de Blasio at the time <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/navy-hospital-ship-comfort-new-york-coronavirus/index.html">seemed enthusiastic</a> about the naval hospital. Cuomo doesn't appear to be turning away the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-04-02-20-intl/h_e58b0778be6ce9bd1642c0efe8bed1b4">temporary Army hospital</a>.</p>

        <p>Not only is your timeline irrelevant, but you seem to contradict the entire spirit of the subreddit, is the virus deadly and putting infected people in nursing homes a bad idea? Or is the virus harmless, nobody should wear masks? Even further, Cuomo didn't force nursing homes to accept covid patients, the nursing home staff THOUGHT they did, which is what caused this whole nursing home fiasco.</p>

        <p>And Democratic governors were tossing covid patients into nursing hoems as if they were live hand grenades for the elderly.  Trump would have never done that.  Those blue states murdered thousands!</p>

        <p>How does that excuse Trump lying about the severity early on? He knew and fucking lied to everyone about it. He's part of the problem with the early confusing messaging we received.</p>

        <p>Why are you putting words in my mouth? I didn't give anyone a free pass. This post and the top-level comment was entirely about Trump until you brought your silly early days covid timeline full of headline only events.</p>
<p>That other people fucked up is tangential. It's true early messaging across the board was wrong in a lot of ways. I didn't particularly follow NY's fuck-ups with the nursing homes, but I'm aware they messed up in some way. I'm in a different region with different leaders. Trump is supposed to be the national lead here, but he's only a con-man thrust into a role far too big for him to manage. In that position he's accountable to me as a citizen, and because of that I'll give him all the blame he deserves.</p>

        <p>Are we just denying the truth here, or are you convinced we really had everything under control?</p>
<p>The Woodward tapes and Trump's tweets at the time made it quite clear he lied about the severity, and the US ability to manage spread. What's worse is because he's Trump when he realized he was wrong, he doubled down and told us to LIBERATE which encouraged things like an assassination plot, and more non-compliance with preventative measures.</p>
