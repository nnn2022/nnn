    <strong>A Call to Remain Resolute</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The idea that individuals should be punished for choosing not to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is absurd. I have read the arguments and general sentiment against those who believe in forcing mass vaccination. I wonder, though, if they have read or listened to the opposing view?</p>
<p>You don’t have to wear a tinfoil hat to know that there are many instances where pharmaceutical companies have caused grievous harm to the public. Whether intentional or not, by the time they recall their products, the damage is done. Why is it wrong to question if the vaccine is safe? Why is it considered crazy to consider personal risk before blind acceptance?</p>
<p>I also have concerns over the call and implementation for punitive measures against those who decide not to take this particular vaccine. Most of the arguments for disregarding bodily autonomy are frightening. The call to “do the right thing” and do it for “the greater good” falls apart when you live in a society that has promoted individualism at nearly every turn. The notion that individuals who don’t fall in line with this narrative should lose their right to peacefully exist is not only terrifying, it’s barbaric. The modern-day fascists of this world are lacking in self-awareness, failing to realize what a slippery slope it is to take away personal agency. Don’t they realize that there will be a time they deeply disagree with public sentiment? </p>
<p>We live in a world where a small percentage of our population hoards their wealth at the expense of the masses. We have been encouraged to drown out the cries of the suffering with pleasurable distractions. We have been told, time and time again, that you have to take responsibility for yourself. Suddenly, though, our largely indifferent government are benevolent caretakers. No one is allowed to find that suspicious? No one is allowed to question if there are ulterior motives?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The militant want us to fold so they can feel safer. When was a life without risk promised? When did we collectively agree to do away with critical thinking? Why are the skeptical being shamed? Why is one of the most selfish nations in the world pretending it cares so deeply about its citizens? </p>
<p>I am allowed to make my own decisions. I am allowed to ask questions. I am allowed to decide that I do not want to play russian roulette with my health to satisfy the unreasonable requests of strangers.  For those who feel the same, don’t give up. The pressure is mounting but we must remain unmoved. There is no such thing as absolute safety or a world without life-threatening disease. </p>
<p>I just wanted to encourage others who are feeling backed against a wall right now. I am prepared to lose everything to retain my right to make my own choices, and I know others are as well. Don’t lose hope, this oppressive hate will not last forever. When the world wants your head on a skewer for daring to think for yourself, you’re probably on the right path. </p>
<p>Mandatory vaccination is unethical and the people who support it are tyrants. They cannot win this battle for reasons that are so much bigger than the virus. I cannot speak for other countries, but this is against everything America represents.</p></p>

        <p>To try to explain how I feel, it's as if a dark cloud is moving in. Its like a great evil is once again upon humanity and the planet.</p>
<p>Sounds crazy right? But its exactly how this feels to me alarm bells are constantly going off in my heart and mind.</p>
<p>The scale of what's happening is mind boggling, we've not seem anything like this in our lifetimes.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I am terrified of guns-the sound/smell/impact of the shot freaks me out,-but my husband has been taking me to the shooting range. It's always good to be able to practice lawful self-defense, but I never thought it would be potentially necessary.</p>

        <p>I'm 100% with you and will not back down.</p>
<p>Although, I have to say it feels like the medical arguments are just means to an end, which is power, control and ultimately global totalitarianism. We're currently looking at de-facto martial law in Australia; imprisonment for serving unvaxed in France; protests against the regime banned in Germany; medical apartheid across most of Europe.</p>

<p>I've been posting from these articles by CJ Hopkins a lot lately. Both are spot on.</p>

<p>&rt;<em>This is the crucial period for the totalitarian movement. It needs to negate the old “reality” in order to implement the new one, and it cannot do that with reason and facts, so it has to do it with fear and brute force. It needs to terrorize the majority of society into a state of mindless mass hysteria that can be turned against those resisting the new “reality.” It is not a matter of persuading or convincing people to accept the new “reality.” It’s more like how you drive a herd of cattle. You scare them enough to get them moving, then you steer them wherever you want them to go. The cattle do not know or understand where they are going. They are simply reacting to a physical stimulus.</em> <strong><em>Facts and reason have nothing to do with it.</em></strong></p>

        <p>Thank you for this post OP. I really needed to hear this. Yesterday I had a bad day. In fact, last week was a bad week. The whole “plague rat” narrative is really hurtful, and frankly, there are times when I feel afraid. But, I will NOT take the shot. If I gave in and took it and got a stroke or blood clots, I’m on my own. I have nobody to take care of me, and I don’t have the money to pay the medical bills. If I can’t work, I can’t take care of myself. I would end up in a nursing home being taken care of by the state, and I would rather die than do that. I just want to live my quiet solitary life and be left alone. I don’t bother anyone and I haven’t done anything wrong. Thank you for the reminder to not give up.</p>
