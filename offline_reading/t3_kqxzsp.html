    <strong>The New Normal is Worse than the Pandemic itself.</strong>
    <p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been raging on for the better part of a year now worldwide, with shifting epicentres across different geographical regions and placing global society and human lifestyle as we know it under the greatest stress ever seen in our collective lifetimes. </p>
<p>In government policy-making across the world, the idea is to take expert advice from across a wide spectrum of industries and societal segments such as healthcare, and make a collective decision based on balancing all the different aspects of individual perspectives from the unique viewpoints and concerns of everyone involved. <strong>However, very few governments and societies in reality achieve this mythical balance of objectivity and consensus, and also then communicate it successfully to their citizens to secure their buy-in and support to conduct such policies.</strong></p>
<p>With the memories of the immediate trauma from the first wave of COVID-19 hitting global healthcare systems and racking up exponential death tolls still fresh in the collective minds of human society, the immediate urge is understandably to err on the side of extreme caution, driven by medical worst-case scenario gaming that preaches maximum prevention of contagion as the primary method of actual mitigation for the new coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p><strong>However, we do not live in societies that are led and administrated to by technocratic scientists and medical professionals. The world we live in is not a massive hospital or biolab with maximum levels of sterility and biological insulation being something that’s feasible to be achieved, let alone be desired.</strong> It is this very myopic drive to secure such fantastically theoretical levels of sterility, in the misguided idea that it is the only way societies and governments can afford to deal with the ongoing pandemic and the resulting optics for those who rule, that is driving increasingly dystopian policy approaches that are formulated more for looking effective, than being sustainably effective from more than just a purely medical and public health standpoint. </p>
<p>The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has moulded human society around the globe to be ever more receptive towards government surveillance and social engineering measures in a manner not seen since 9/11 brought about the modern-day security state we observe through our security checks at airport gates and CCTV cameras on every street corner. Digital apps for use on smartphones and gadgets of every sort are increasingly being touted as some sort of technological ID system for the tracking of population movements, interactions, and possibly “safe” immunity status for members of society, by governments who have been ambiguous at best and downright opaque at worst about their development origins, oversight of data usage, and actual effectiveness.</p>
<p>Society has substituted human physical and social interaction, inbuilt into our very psyches as human beings, with entirely digital connections and interactions in a matter of months, through measures like remote working, schooling, and e-commerce. <strong>Human society has been forced by the pandemic to adapt and accept limited to no social contact in a very short span of time measured in mere weeks, and all these measures have been pushed through with shrewd messaging of “desperate times call for desperate measures” and “it’s only temporarily for combating the pandemic”.</strong> </p>
<p>Such social engineering and public policies might secure popular societal support and cooperation for the immediate moment up to a couple months. But the world is now rapidly reaching a timeline stage where it becomes increasingly impossible to sustain such societal lockdown measures, be it financially or commanding societal support. <strong>Medical professionals and government leaders would have us believe that the only way a virus pandemic with so many unknowns can be mitigated or combated against is to assume worst-case scenarios, prioritizing the value of human life purely on the basis of their collective health status.</strong></p>
<p>Even if it means gutting for the indeterminate future entire industries and facets of life that demand mass social interaction of humans such as tourism, leisure entertainment, or even simple things like dining out with people other than immediate family.</p>
<p>Even if it means having restrictive public movement measures that severely limit how people travel, who they can meet, and tracking every step of where they go and who they interact with in their daily lives, all in the fear of that one “Patient Zero” that might get away as the smoking gun starting a new epidemic wave. </p>
<p><strong>This is an even more pertinent and relevant issue for countries with substantial human-input intensive industries such as tourism, entertainment, dependent on relatively free movement of human labour in or out of their borders for their economies to be viable.</strong> Without these industries being able to function in any manner that comes at least 80% close to pre-pandemic standards and levels, many such national financial coffers stand to be severely impacted both from outright financial losses and increased demands for state financial support. This bodes ill for long-term efforts at both combating the COVID-19 pandemic as well as building up public health infrastructures to cope with possible increased demand and stress loads in future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is also the humanistic angle to consider: <strong>human beings are made to desire, require, and thrive on actual physical and social interactions with each other. It is after all what distinguishes us from mechanical robots devoid of emotions or feeling, and vitally important for societal mental health as a collective.</strong> Whilst societies might accept severe restrictions on such human liberties of social interaction and activities outside of the house for either work or leisure for a short time, it is extremely unlikely to be something that is sustainable beyond a few months, or even possible repeats of lockdowns and reimposed social restrictions when new epidemic hotspots flare up (as displayed in countries such as Japan, South Korea and the latest being the UK and multiple EU countries). </p>
<p>There used to be optimism, no matter how faint, that a vaccine will be found for n-COV19 in the year since the virus first appeared in Wuhan, China. That’s the glass half-full approach. <strong>The glass-half empty approach is to recognize that there is always the possibility of a cure never being found; n-COV19 is part of the coronavirus family, which also includes the common flu virus which mutates so much that annual vaccinations of varying effectiveness are required for any society to achieve meaningful herd immunity status. Four members of the coronavirus family, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63, cause the common cold, for which there is no cure.</strong></p>
<p>Right now, governments across the world are taking the self-contradictory approach of trying to make unpalatable social engineering measures and restrictions on personal liberties, based off preventing the glass half-empty approach, acceptable with the sweetener of messaging couched from the glass half-full approach of a mythical future cure-all vaccine in the immediate to near future. What are the chances however, of businesses, industries, entire facets of society, or even collective societal mental health surviving that long in suspended animation, irrationally fearful of an uncertain future where the coronavirus might still be existing?</p>
<p><strong>Positive messaging under such circumstances will be ineffective and engender even harsher blowbacks from human societies who would increasingly perceive the coronavirus pandemic as being a convenient tool for their livelihoods being re-engineered into a dystopian state, being entirely dependent on digital connections and communication, whilst simultaneously exposed to government surveillance and arbitrary restrictions on the most basic of human desires for physical interaction and movement, with little to no impartial and accountable oversight.</strong> </p>
<p>Societal blowback is already beginning to manifest in the West as governments grapple with trying to please both those who argue for personal liberties, freedom, and financial solvency, and those who argue for collective public health security out of a base sense of fear, paranoia and insecurity. Do not discount the possibility of such blowback happening in Asian countries, even if many Asian countries do not have a long and well-entrenched tradition of liberal democracy or civil rights being understood or practiced in such societies. There will come a time when the argument for reopening global societies from the grips of pandemic lockdown stem from far more than simple calculations of economics vs potential human lives lost, but also from a sense of recognition that whatever the “new normal” might be for society in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, <strong>it cannot be one that is worse than pre-pandemic societal conditions, both in terms of individual rights, liberties, accountable rule of law, freedom of movements, the maintenance of collective human sanity through leisure and entertainment outlets, and the needs and desires for actual human connections to exist in society beyond digital means.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Franklin D. Roosevelt once famously said during the Great Depression that “the only thing to fear is fear itself”.</strong> Asia and the world now are firmly in the grips of pandemic fear, fanned by an unholy trinity of haphazard and reactionary government leadership, sensationalist and badly researched media coverage, and most damaging of all, a lack of honesty and consensus amongst the scientific and medical community on the extent they are flying blind in combating this new virus, and how it influences their input to governments to base public policy on.</p>
<p>Governments will need to swallow the bitter pill and be prepared to have the real conversation with both the scientific/medical community, and society at large on the actual trade-off between securing collective public health, and engineering such a controlled society and state of individual living that might as well exist as a petri-dish in a sterile hospital lab. It remains unclear whether the world is ready for such a terrible, but urgently necessary conversation and debate.   </p>

<p>This is probably pure anger and cynicism talking, but as someone who used to get mocked on Reddit for saying this sort of thing even pre-2020, and had tons of downvotes and people berating me because I was "acting like a boomer lol", I feel like humans allowed this to happen. The elites may have concocted this little charade, but the masses allowed it to happen, and many of them even embrace it. They <em>like</em> being left to their devices (literal ones), and spending their time alone, neglecting the people around them, and having a purpose in life, in order to sit around and watch Netflix and order Uber Eats. At this point, if and when the new normal goes into full swing with mass surveillance and control measures that will hinder quality of life, I can't say I'll feel bad. People, in their stupidity and shortsightedness, ushered this era in. We, in this group of skeptics, didn't do enough either clearly. Fuck the world. I feel done with it, personally.</p>

<p>I agree we're all guilty. We'll sit here and post memes all day but the real work isn't online, it's taking action on our communities. The governments are happy for us to dissent in our echo chambers because they know online action isn't really action.</p>
