    <strong>Vaccinated are twice as likely to die to the delta variant then the unvaccinated according to the uk government’s own stats. 2.19 times more likely to die if vaccinated. P&lt;0.01</strong>
    <p><p>Pg 12</p>
<p>35,521 unvaccinated and 34 deaths</p>
<p>17,642 vaccinated and 37 deaths</p>
<p>This indicates you are 2.19 times more likely to die with the vaccine from the delta variant then the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>P&lt;0.01</p>
<p>This is to be expected from ADE</p>

        <p>The data doesn't actually show that you get vaccinated you have a higher chance of getting sick / dying from it. The data shows that, if you selected a person at random who was already in the hospital, if they had had the vaccine they are twice as likely to die, but it does not show that if a person gets the vaccine, their chance of dying increases.  The numbers that are reported are only for people who both tested positive and who had the vaccine.  We know that people who are immunocompromised are more likely to die if they get covid, and we also know the vaccine is less effective for people who are immunocompromised, so it'd be reasonable to conclude that the vaccinated but positive population would be biased towards people who are immunocompromised.  There are probably also other confounding variables (as older people / at risk people got the vaccine earlier, and this was conducted from Feb - June, the population of positive + vaccined would be skewed towards older / at risk people) that also contribute to this.</p>

        <p>That's not the case - it means that they are safer if they get the vaccine, just not as safe as someone who isn't immunocompromised. The reason why you would see a bias towards immunocompromised people in the group of people who got sick and got the vaccine isn't because the vaccine makes you more likely to get sick, but because the people who aren't immunocompromised and didn't get the vaccine are less likely to be in the group.</p>
<p>E.g. Say you have a vaccine that works 100% of the time for non-immunocompromised people, and 50% of the time for people who are immunocompromised (I know these % aren't real but it's just to keep math easier).  Lets also say the average person gets covid 10% of the time but immunocompromised people get it 20% of the time. For easy math lets also say that 1% of normal people and 5% of immunocompromised people die if they get covid.</p>
<p>If you have a group of 50k normal and 50k immunocompromised people (100k total), you'd get a breakdown of:</p>
<p>5k normal + 10k immunocompromised = 15k people get covid</p>
<p>50 + 500 = 550 people die from covid. </p>
<p>This would be presented in the data as 15k people got sick, and 550 people died, to have a mortality rate of 3.7%</p>
<p>If everyone was vaccinated you'd get:</p>
<p>0 normal + 5k immunocompromised = 5k people get covid</p>
<p>0 + 250 = 250 people die from covid</p>
<p>This would be presented in the data as 5k got sick and 250 died, giving a mortality rate of 5%</p>
<p>However, for both immunocompromised and normal people, they are less likely to die from covid in this scenario, even though it looks like they are 5/3.7=1.35 times more likely to.</p>

        <p>Ok, ok I see what you're saying, that people who died from the vax are probably going to die from the coof as well.</p>
<p>But again... With your example, doesn't that mean the vax is far likelier going to reach the immunocompromised than the virus?</p>

        <p>I think the way I'd put it is more of, if your immune system isn't strong enough to be able to learn defense against a virus from a vaccine (and thus get covid), it's also likely that it isn't strong enough to fight off the virus (and thus die).  I'm sorry if I was unclear in my example, what I mean is no one died from the vax (as in, no one got the shot, and then later died directly due to the shot), but that people got the vax but then later got covid and still died (as in, the vax wasn't effective in defending against covid for them)</p>

        <p>First off, that's not what the situation is.</p>
<p>Secondly, no one dies immediately from the coof either.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I was referring to infection rate. By doing mass vax, you're exposing people to adverse reaction which they may never experience if they don't catch the bug. (Infection rate is in the single digits btw)</p>

        <p>I mean, I'd hope more people were exposed to the vaccination than infected by the virus, that'd suggest that it's working (and keeping the infection rate low)</p>
<p>And yes, I'm aware that the situation I laid out isn't reflective of real numbers - I was just using a simplified example to show that by looking at mortality rates and nothing else, you can easily come to a conclusion that is misleading at best and incorrect at worst.</p>

        <p>And at least in the United States they are testing vaccinated people less frequently only if they’re severely ill And unvaccinated get tested even if they’re just barely sickso if this is at all the case in the UK the numbers of those who would test positive for this “Delta” variant are off by a lot</p>

        <p>well if you want to get into that, then they all should.</p>
<p>just like natural immune system once it has antibodies, it can identify any strain (largely due to the fact that the sequence variations between all of them is so small they can still be recognized) </p>
<p>but to answer your main concern : NOT a single one of them will</p>
<p>a) protect you</p>
<p>b) protect others from you transmitting it(in the case your become an asymptomatic carrier (why? see a) :-)  )</p>
