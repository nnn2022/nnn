    <strong>The advent of people looking to government to save them from peril is an inherent consequence of the absence of faith.</strong>
    <p><p>What we are watching unfold today is the natural consequence of generations of children being taught there is no God. It is the natural result of being told that science holds all the answers. That men are the directors of our own destinies. </p>
<p>We live in fear, desperately reaching out for a savior. Searching for the one person who holds all the answers. Those of us who know God, know also his peace and his comfort. We know HE holds the answers and the one who holds the answers also holds us. We know also that we are not promised tomorrow. We cannot hold off living until tomorrow because tomorrow is never guaranteed. But we live ever more in the hands of small, fearful men.</p>
<p>Where do you turn to when there is no God? Where do you turn when you're scared and it seems the world is falling apart? Where do you find comfort in the absence of a comforter? Naturally men look to other clueless men, hoping they may hold the answers. In our desperation we turn against each other. We turn on our fellow men, we fear for our lives and like frightened animals backed into a corner we lash out. We lash out at those who are different. We lash out at those who are a <em>threat</em>. We choose ourselves a mighty leader (the science) to save us and we must destroy any who would disobey. There can be no dissent because dissent means death. All must conform and obey.</p>
<p>There is hope my friends. There is truth. And His name is Jesus. </p>
<p>Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
John 14:6 KJV</p>
<p>Do not be conformed to the ways of this world. Do not be deceived. Call on the name of the Lord and be saved. From beginning to end, it is written. There is no escaping the fate of this world. Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and be saved and save others. In this time of darkness, be a light and let your light shine. Give that light to others, for that light is Christ. Live for others. Love others as yourself. Give. Be kind. Do not be overcome of evil by overcome evil with good.</p>
<p>Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.  Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.  Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
Romans 12:17‭, ‬20‭-‬21 KJV</p></p>

        <p>You don't need religious faith in order to not depend on government to protect you. Self respect and critical thinking skills are sufficient.</p>

        <p>You're right, you don't. There are plenty of individuals that aren't particularly religious that have a worldview similar to my own in many ways. You most certainly do not HAVE to have God in order to nit depend on the government. BUT we're speaking in terms of people, not individuals. Individuals have the capacity to be intelligent and think critically. Individuals have the capacity to challenge authority. But THE HERD does not think like that. And what I've said is true of people on the whole. As a whole, people are scared and easily led astray. </p>
<p>Specifically, generations of people that have been brought up on the basis that man is the ultimate, that there is no God, that science holds all the answers, have developed a mindset that is incompatible with liberty or independent thought.</p>
<p>The way you have cultivated yourself as an individual is the exception, not the rule. Most people have been spoonfed their worldview their entire lives and would never think to challenge it. Which, if we're being om honest here, would go for many religious people as well, at least those who have never challenged the views they grew up with. But even then, I would challenge that most of those have also never developed genuine faith. </p>
<p>On the whole, we have a large population of scared people with nowhere to turn to. People who are scared of death and in that fear, are desperate and willing to do just about anything in order to feel secure.</p>

        <p>Indeed, this life is temporary. Death comes for us all. It is a fact many are unwilling to face. And those faced with the fear of death will go to some outrageous lengths in order to be made to feel secure. But what's most dangerous is was people will do to OTHERS to make themselves feel safe and secure.</p>

        <p>I really enjoyed Bloodborne, one of my favorite games of all time. To be honest though, I do feel guilty for it. I know it's not a game God wants me to be playing. Insofar as that goes, I really shouldn't be playing any video games. It's a sinful habit and there's no excuse except for idleness and slothfulness.</p>

        <p>I'm also a big fan of Sekiro :) I haven't tried any of the souls games though. Bloodborne was my first, such an awesome experience, brilliant world building and I love the difficulty but fair game mechanics. The games are hard but very technically balanced. When you die it's pretty much always your fault for screwing up.</p>

        <p>I have to disagree my friend. Jesus IS God and He IS the only way. I was once in the sme place as you are and I understand, it can seem like a very good place to be in. But, if you're right then quite simply Jesus is not who He says He is. That would make Jesus a liar. But I assure you He is no liar. He is the way, the truth and the life. Jesus is God. He is the Word made flesh. The beginning and the end... and there is nothing better in all of existence than to know Him. </p>
<p>I know your heart is in the right place friend. I know you're being sincere. But that doesn't make what you say true. The heart is deceitful above all things. God has given us His Word because He knew that we would be led astray. He knows the deceifulness of our hearts and that we NEED guidance we can trust and depend on. Without His word of absolute truth, we are blind believing we can see. </p>
<p>But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
Matthew 6:23</p>
<p>Without The Light we are swallowed up by the darkness. Jesus is that light friend and there is no other.</p>

        <p>Ok now - despite my previous experiences arguing with christians - I will continue and try to provide you my point of view.</p>
<p>See, I totally get when you say jesus is the only way in the sense that love, forgiveness and compassion truly is the only way! I am all for that and totally agree!</p>
<p>And I most certainly would never call him a liar! </p>
<p>But what you guys don't seem to understand is, that jesus word was twisted by the dark in a way that it serves separation instead of unity and that it makes people dependent instead of free. </p>
<p>Just look what the church has done throughout history in his name and please dont tell me that this was inspired by jesus! </p>
<p>The Bible contains many truths, no doubt! But it was also partly twisted in a way that does not serve the light! </p>
<p>The simple idea, that someone who has never heard of jesus but is a perfectly loving person and does nothing except helping others, will not find god is just plain pathetic and quite honetly completely arrogant and mean!</p>
<p>Would Jesus tell a person who is so in touch with his soul and giving love with every action, that they need to follow him? No! he would say: great! thanks for being awesome, bye!</p>
<p>See? I dont think it is of any help to go around and teach people that only exclusively and just jesus is the way to find god.. this only serves separation ("we are right, and you are not"), which is the opposite of unity, which is the way of love..</p>
<p>God loves everyone of us, if we read the bible or not!</p>
<p>And even someone who didnt read the bible can find god (simply by looking inside his own heart).</p>
<p>This is a fact you can't argue!</p>
<p>The very deception the bible warns about is exactly what deceives you to believe otherwise! This has lead to thousands of people being killed in the name of god and it continues to this day to separate the people instead of uniting them.</p>
<p>If we would all recognize the little jesus in ourselves and love each other and trust that this love will lead us to god and his heaven, we wouldn't need to argue whether your way to god is better than my way..</p>
<p>really.. you guys are mostly a loving bunch of people, but you are fucking ignorant if you deny someones access to god, simply because he does not read the bible or pray to jesus.</p>
<p>please consider this! it does not take away anything from your belief, it just allows others to experience god in their own way..</p>

        <p>Hello. Forgive me for taking this long to get back to you. I'd like you to know that I understand your position. There was indeed a time when I believed as you believe now. I have experienced the same questions and doubts and feelings. By the grace of God, I will do my best to address them appropriately with what time I have.</p>
<p>First of I would like to address your concern about those who have never known or never had access to know Jesus. It's truly a very troubling idea, that such souls would simply be abondoned by God. To that I would like to direct you to the following verses.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 4:29
But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</p>
<p>Proverbs 8:17 
I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p>Jeremiah 29:13
And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.</p>
<p>Matthew 7:7
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</p>
<p>Acts 17:24-28
God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;  Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;  And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;  That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:  For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</p>
<p>God will not abandone those who seek Him with all their heart and soul. God will answer anyone who truly wishes to know HIM. He will answer all those who seek the truth. My friend do you not think God's righteousness and judgement are greater than your own? He is a fair and righteous judge.</p>
<p>Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
Psalms 89:14</p>
<p>But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
Psalms 86:15 KJV</p>
<p>Take heart. You KNOW that God is good. He is. But you are getting in your own way of the truth, following your own heart instrad of what is right. </p>
<p>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.  In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.  Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.
Proverbs 3:5‭-‬7 KJV</p>
<p>I know that you believe that you are awakening and believe me I understand, I have been there. I abondoned the path of truth in favor of awakening. In favor of pursuing what I thought was the TRUE truth. Believing that I could be my own guide in the wilderness. Believing that I could navigate the darkness on my own. I was deceived my friend... I hope you take what I am saying to heart because it is the truth. You believe you are following the light, but that light you are following is darkness and it will lead you into the pit. And you will not receive the same judgement as one who was never exposed to the truth. You will receive the judgement of one who received the truth and rejected it.</p>
<p>For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;  And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.
2 Timothy 4:3‭-‬4 KJV</p>
<p>The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?  I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.
Jeremiah 17:9‭-‬10 KJV</p>
<p>We are led astray by the folly of our hearts my friend. We our led into darkness by our lusts. I am running out of time and must be going, but I pray that you will consider these things and that the Word of God will prick your heart. May the Lord be with you my friend. May you know His kindness, His peace and His mercy. God Bless.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry you feel that way, though to be honest, when I used to think as you do, I found Christians to be most frustrating. Particularly Christians that were able to see past all the other illusions of this world. All the lies and manipulations, altered history.. people that could clearly see that the world was a stage, that we've been lied to throughout history. Could see even that the different churches had lied and done terrible things throughout history so why... WHY do they hold on to this BIBLE, even when they know that history has been manipulated by man? I was so convinced of my own mental superiority I couldn't understand. It was so clear to me that, just like everything else, the Bible had obviously been tampered with... I just couldn't understand that it was ME that couldn't see clearly. </p>
<p>I not mad at you for thinking what you think or believing what you believe. I understand more than you know. I'm just trying to warn you you're swimming in more darkness than you realize.</p>

        <p>Easy now. I never said you should blindly follow The Bible. You can be honest with God about all your question. If the truth cannot withstand investigation it's not much for truth is it? The Bible has withstood the test of time and God is not afraid of your questions and concerns. </p>
<p>You may be interested in the truth but I suspect you're more interested in believing about God what makes you feel good. It's easy to believe in a God without fiery judgment, but His judgment is very real. None of us can be "good enough" for God on our own merits. That is the reason the Jesus, God's own Son and God Himself, lived and died on the cross. Jesus' life here was a sacrifice for US. </p>
<p>I suspect you also don't like the idea of not leaning on our own understanding. I must say, God wouldn't be much of a God if we understood everything He does. His ways our higher and greater than our ways and beyond our understanding.  He is GOD.</p>
