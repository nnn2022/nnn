    <strong>PEOPLE HATE ME FOR THIS COVID CURE: I ate Ice Cream and Taco Bell for a few days and now 100%</strong>
    <p><p>I was 99.9% sure I only had a cold, because it felt like a mild cold.  When I got the PCR test positive result  and realized I WAS 1000% FUBAR TERMINAL I decided to just get my fav fast food since I clearly was on Death Row....</p>
<p>Also I didn't feel like cooking and the roomies didn't want me around the house so I just drove around a lot and ate fast food.  </p>
<p>1 week of just cold like symptoms and I was better, just like EVERY OTHER COLD I'VE EVER had.  If we could re-open things now so I don't have to hear about another young family friend overdosing and dying that would be super chill! (up to 2 so far! Idk anyone who has died from Covid tho :/??)</p></p>

        <p>In my city, the city counsel held a meeting where they were deciding whether to ban kids from playing organized sports on their fields. A father stated his son was suicidal and sports were his outlet. A mother begged the city to consider the affect lock downs have had in her community, 3 of her sons friends committed suicide but no deaths from covid. In one ear and out the other as the city voted to close down the parks. The epidemiologist they had on did not bring any data supporting the decision yet kept saying “follow the data.” It was so heartbreaking and infuriating to watch.</p>

        <p>In order to have any credibility the officials need to talk to epidemiologists along side psychologists, economists, law enforcement, etc.</p>

        <p>This is why we should not stop the spread. So many people will realize it’s not so bad. I don’t know that many people who told me they had it. I know 2 who had a really bad time. The others were completely fine in a short time. I wonder how many people I know who had it but I have not spoken with them. The doctors know better how to treat it now.</p>

        <p>With so many asymptomatic cases of covid, I wonder if your cold was actually caused by the usual rhino virus but covid was just floating around.</p>

        <p>This is probably the case. PCR isn’t diagnostic. All it does is amplify whatever the target is. So if you have already had Covid and fought it off, and only had small fragments of the virus left in your system it will still give you a positive result. </p>
<p>PCR is a great tool to use. It helps geneticists and biologists amplify genetic material from small sample sizes like drug resistant bacteria. But it cannot with any degree of certainty tell you if you have an active infection or not. A huge hole in how all of this has been approached.</p>
