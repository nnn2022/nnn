    <strong>Did anyone ever ask old people what THEY want?</strong>
    <p><p>Serious question, since this is reportedly all to keep the old and vulnerable "safe" did anyone ever ask those people if they preferred safety over enjoying their last years of life?</p>
<p>With all these videos coming out it seems like lockdowns had no beneficiaries young or old other than a few smug redditors who enjoy watching human misery.</p></p>

        <p>Of course not. Their opinions and voices on the situation dont matter. It only matters that we save them, even if it means we make their remaining time on this earth unbearable.</p>
<p>Its not selfish either. Even though it sounds selfish, to put our thoughts and feelings above theirs. Its really not. We are saving them after all. That can't ever be selfish, can it? </p>

        <p>You might not want it but you might get it though. If you listen to a lot of the talk, there seems to be a very long haul ahead and once people are burnt out they'll accept that these restrictions "are just normal now". That's why you see the phrase "new normal" so much.</p>

        <p>That's great and all, until she or the people she passes it to require hospital resources that then can't be used to treat her friends with the winter flu, or when her grandkids get sick and need help. The NHS will not stop treating covid patients because they accepted the risk by going shopping, and there is clearly a very real threat that they become overwhelmed and are unable to perform their regular vital duties.</p>

        <p>No of course not. My grandparents (in their early 80s but very healthy for the age) REFUSE to be stuck at home. My grandfather especially has always been fiercely independent, he still chops his own firewood...but they've been flying and driving up and down the East coast visiting my family, and all my cousins families all summer. And yes they will be at the big family Thanksgiving gathering my cousins are having on their farm in North Carolina. My grandfather's quote: "I don't know how many summers we have left.

        <p>My in-laws are miserable. My FIL had two strokes and my MIL has dementia. It isn’t the type where she just forgets, she’s violent and rambles on and on. My FIL wants to die. He’s straight up told us. He was a smoker before the stroke and he was trying to off himself by not taking his blood pressure medication. When my MIL first developed dementia she told my fiancé she didn’t want to continue living.</p>
<p>My fiancé doesn’t even want his parents around because of their condition. Both of them want to die. My FIL cared for MIL before his stroke. He put us in a position to have to take care of them. My fiancé has so many siblings that we only have them for a month or two at a time, but I couldn’t image having his parents here 24/7.</p>
<p>I know not everyone is like my in-laws, but I’ve heard so many anecdotes about old people who are sick or just so old they want to die. It’s horrible. I can’t imagine how bad they feel for being the reason we’re putting our lives on hold.</p>

        <p>This is really awful. My aunt (late 60s) has early stage Alzheimer's as well, and I talk to her on the phone every day. At the beginning of the lockdowns she seemed to be doing fine, but her mental state is getting worse and worse by the day. She has assistants (who follow all of the precautions and whatnot, since she is at increased risk) at her house who take care of her and sometimes she has to be assisted in talking on the phone.</p>
<p>When I do hear her speak, she mentions how she wishes this would all end so she could just see my face again. I just feel so sad and angry when I see doomers calling us selfish for wanting lockdowns and antisocial distancing to end. I care about my family, and some of my family members are really suffering because of all this.</p>
<p>But muh covidiots bad cuz they dont wear muh masks right? Muh 230K!!! Trump bad!!!</p>

        <p>My fiancé is 40 and his parents are in their seventies. His mom got it early on, him and his dad noticed it when she was in her sixties. I didn’t know him at the time so I never witnessed the start of it. Anyways, she was mostly normal and then there was a sudden drop off about five years ago. Now she’s absolutely insane. She has no idea what’s going on. It’s really hard to describe what she’s like without seeing her. </p>
<p>My FIL is on the verge of death. His condition is getting worse. He’s not with us now but last I heard he can’t walk anymore. My MIL could live for ten more years, she’s not showing any signs of slowing down. I’m only 25, I’m having to postpone my life because of COVID on top of his parents. I’m losing my mind.</p>

        <p>I am beginning to believe that the object of the exercise is to make life so fucking miserable that people will be happy by getting a fraction of their freedom back. </p>
<p>The great reset has begun. You think your life sucked before, having to endure all the silly first world problems? </p>
<p>Just wait to see what the solution is going to be.</p>
<p>I never thought I would live to see it, but it appears the filthy masses of retards are going to voluntarily accept and encourage living as slaves because they are too stupid to know wtf they are doing. </p>
<p>As to the original question: the powers that be don't care what anyone wants because your question assumes that they are acting out of benevolence instead of the actual malevolence.</p>

        <p>My parents are 81 and 66, and all of us had a bad respiratory bug last Christmas when I was visiting them in my home state. Earlier this year, my dad tested positive for antibodies so we figured that all 3 of us have had COVID. Since then, they’re not buying the media panic. All of us recovered just fine without medical care. </p>
<p>We are still visiting them for Christmas like we do every year because what if next year is too late for one of them? They’re glad we’re still coming because we live 600 miles away and can only afford to travel once or twice a year.</p>

        <p>Was just in Mexico and talked to several elderly couples in there 70s and they hate everything that is going on. They told us they want to live their lives however they see fit because they don’t have much time left anyway. It’s so sad that we are keeping the elderly held captive as prisoners for “safety”</p>

        <p>My husband’s grandmother was moved to a care facility last year because of her dementia. Since Alberta had crazy regulations her son can’t be near her, they have to sit outside with masks on and 6 feet apart. Every time he goes to visit her, her illness has gotten worse, she cries every time because she wants a hug from him. Her mental state has gotten so bad that she only speaks German and she is so afraid the natzis (the nurses) are out to harm her. I really don’t see how they think this is keeping the old people safe.</p>

        <p>there were other beneficiaries, beyond bought redditers and social media troll farms in general.</p>
<p>the beneficiaries are of course the leaders of huge online businesses, the vaccination and pharma industry and the kakistocracy in general.</p>
<p>not only did they get record growth and profit, but they also furthered their goal of a digital fully controlled dystopia.</p>
<p>and they even had a great laugh from it too, to the point, where they couldn't hold their smirk back, despite being on TV:</p>
<p>and this is where the youtube video of bill gates laughing and smirking as he hears about the economic destruction from the fakedemic measures, BUT the video is gone from youtube.</p>
<p>bitchute links get autoflagged and shadowbanned  and even the subreddits, that it was posted on got deleted by evil reddit :D</p>
<p>gogo censorship. this of course is another great win for the kakistocracy. (insert bill gates, rothschilds, etc... smirks here)</p>

        <p>My granny who's 80+ is following the restrictions etc. to protect young people, not herself. She's fine with the restrictions because of she's afraid of young people getting COVID19 because of she knows how horrible it would be for them. She don't think it's good for young people to meeting their fears if it can be avoided. Even just a runny nose is horrible for hypochondria, so she doesn't wish the discomfort on them.</p>
<p>Many old people are just fine with this because of they're doing it for young people. Personally they knows as old people themselves they're going to die soon and therefor aren't doing it for their own sake. Many old people and chronically ill are peace with death, and others knows the COVID19 and the flu is both a threat to them. You don't lockdown society for the flu. I don't want her to die, so I would stay at home if I becomes sick and only meet her when it's safe. I just don't support a lockdown and don't believe in a blame game.</p>
<p>It's young people having their whole life ahead of them, who've death anxiety and who are hypochondria we're doing the lockdown for.</p>

        <p>My brother and I just celebrated my dads 77th birthday with him. He’s type 2 diabetic, can barely walk, and has had multiple mini-strokes. We both still hugged him.</p>
<p>To doomers: </p>
<p>Wanna know why? Me and my bro have both been limiting our contact with him through this because we know he’s high risk. We also recognize that he’s been on the brink of death for a long time, all it takes is one slip in the shower and we’re getting THAT call. We’re prepared for it, even before COVID was a thing. It’s the acceptance of death. While y’all are stuck somewhere between the denial and the bargaining phase, the NNN crowd has already moved on to the acceptance phase. That’s it. Death happens. It’s okay. Every person on earth has to deal with it from one cause or another.</p>
<p>I hugged my dad because it could be the last time I see him. And I don’t want him to pass not hugging his sons since Father’s Day. It’s cruel. He didn’t push us away, saying “we’re in a pandemic!”  He was ecstatic that his kids came to see him. That’s how he wants to go out, and that’s how I’d rather go out too. </p>
<p>Fuck the doomers letting their grandma die alone.</p>

        <p>Why don't you take the initiative? Go around, ask every last one of them, get people involved in some hashtag, compile the list, then release it.</p>
<p>I'll confess, I don't belong in the sub, I belong in the opposite ones. It felt to me like you are implying that all or most of them would say no to quarantine (I apologize if that is presumptuous). But I am not too sure that that is how the votes would line up.</p>
<p>My guess, it will be around 60%-40% (which way it tilts I am not sure). So what then? Imagine you were the president of some random country about to get hit for the first time. And you get a referendum from the elderlies, and the vote is split. What would you do?</p>
<p>I don't mean it as a gotcha question. Even though I am on the other side, I wanna know genuinely what you would do in case of a split vote.</p>
<p>My simple-minded solution would be a quarantine that is optional. And that every one who refuses to follow quarantine should register with the government beforehand. People found in that database will have the lowest priority if hospitals fill up or resources run out. And allow insurance companies to charge more for such behavior. I can think of nothing fairer that caters to both sides.</p>

        <p>I work for a living association of rich old people. Everything you stated is right. MANY of them are sick of this shit. They want to see their families, don't care about staying in, being safe, keeping the masks on, etc. And I am with them 1000%. It's idiotic we are in lockdown or whatever this long... Many them aren't even wearing their masks properly haha. But this covid thing has made them REALLY cranky and bitter.</p>

        <p>No one asked anyone what they wanted.</p>
<p>That's kind of the crux of the matter.  It completely sidestepped any sort of democratic process including any elected officials and was implemented entirely by bureaucrats.  Sure, most governors rolled over and asked <a href="https://thewilderride.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Episode-21-Weve-got-to-protect-our-phoney-baloney-jobs-1024x576.jpg">what do we need to do</a>?    but all of the decisions were made bureaucratically.</p>
