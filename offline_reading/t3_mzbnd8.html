    <strong>Concerns about vaccine shedding and spreading such shedding, from someone living with vaccinated or soon-to-be vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>I want to know if unvaccinated people who got shedding from vaccinated people can spread it to other unvaccinated people too.</p>
<p>Asking because I unfortunately live with my parents and brother still who are all Doomers and my mom got the vax this past weekend and my dad was told to get it this weekend. And my brother plans to make an appointment for one as soon as he can.</p>
<p>My mom was the only one I thought I could convince to not take it but she is brainwashed completely because even though she's aware of the side effects, she wants the vaccine so she can be "safe from the virus"</p>
<p>So eventually I'll be surrounded by vaccinated people in the place I live in so I have no choice but to be around them eventually. My concern is that I won't ever be able to see my best friend again because she is refusing the vaccine like I am but if I get shedding from my vaxxed family I'm afraid I can spread that shedding to her and basically fuck up her body system and all the horrible symptoms for women we've read about or heard.</p>
<p>Would basically mean I'd either have to move out of my home asap or never see my best friend again, which would be devastating to me emotionally because she and I have been the only ones there for eachother for years and she's probably number 1 in my life.</p>
<p>If anyone has any insight into this, it would be greatly appreciated. I hope the shedding only transmits from vaxxed to unvaxxed and not with infected-unvaxxed to unvaxxed</p></p>

<p>Some of the most pro-vaccine scientists have come out and stated the shed will be horrific. This is all easily researched and all these scientists have impeccable resumes. There is no conspiracy about second and third order effects from the "vaccinated".</p>
<p>It's about to get ugly.</p>

        <p>I appreciate the honest take. I pray we find out exactly what these effects are and how many degrees of infection can happen asap. My own personal livelihood will depend on it but think of all the nurses and doctors, who refuse the bad, and how many Doomers they're surrounded by daily at hospitals. They're at risk for this 2nd-hand shed as well</p>

        <p>Listen I know I’m just gonna get downvoted anyways but I’m genuinely curious what you guys think is shedding from people? Like explain to me what you think happening? I didn’t know that this was an anti vax sub I just responded to it in all since I work in the field.</p>

        <p>They are spike proteins. Not viruses, so they are not infectious and will not cause the recipient to be affected. Plus I think the study your are referencing is the finding anti-spike igg not the spike protein itself. Basically the study just shows that the vaccine works.</p>

        <p>Find me a confirmed source of this because I’m not finding anything. And as I said igg does travel through breast milk. That’s why I was confused on why op was worried about getting vaccinated by being around his family members because it assumes he is breastfeeding. The babies immunity is from the igg though not spike proteins.</p>

        <p>If your worried about blood clots then you should get the vaccine. You are 10x more likely to get a clot from covid than the vaccine. The point in the spike protein is to bind to ace2. I meant the mechanism for shedding the vaccine or whatever OP was talking about.</p>

        <p>One way is through altered pheromone production. Watched a holistic doctor's video on that the other night and learned a ton about the olfactory system and how it triggers chemical reactions in the brain. This was her theory as to why women are having serious menstrual issues.</p>
<p>I'm not a doctor but there a lot of anecdotal stories across the web about everyone around a vaccinated person becoming sick. Of course, the vaccinated think that these people have finally caught the Rona, while they didn't because they are vaxxed, even though they all these newly sick people managed to avoid it for over a year. But a few days around the vaccinated and family and friends are dropping all around them. Not sure of all the mechanisms but top medical experts agree that this will be a serious problem.</p>

        <p>I was confused by OP saying you could shed the vaccine. There may be an immune response in the olfactory cells but there will not be infection so I’m not on board for her theory but I haven’t looked into it. The menstrual issues would be a rare side effect, not something that should prevent anyone from getting the vaccine. Interestingly I was just as curious about the anecdotal stories you mentioned, it seems that when people get vaccinated they think that they are immune to covid and stop doing preventative measures. I think it’s also an internal bias that these stories stand out when for the most part it prevents the spread of the virus. To be fair I got the flu vaccine twice and both times I got the flu, so I stopped getting the vaccine even though I knew they weren’t connected, so I understand where you are coming from even though I don’t agree with it.</p>

        <p>The pheromone disruption through the olfactory system causes an endocrine response. This response may be abnormal based on the chemistry of the pheromones. That is what the doctor was saying with many cited studies from research regarding this phenomena.</p>

        <p>Dr. Bossche is one. World class vaccine designer. Stopped the Internet for a day when he came out about a month ago and said this would lead to worldwide catastrophe.</p>
<p>Forget the doctor's name that was former chief scientist for Phizer, but his videos are all over Bitchute.</p>
<p>A famous Indian doctor came out last week and said the same thing. Those videos are on Bitchute.</p>
<p>Dr. Tenpenny and Mikovits go into this extensively as well, but they are known anti-vaxxers. Still their information stacks up with the 3 doctors above who are all as pro vaccine as they come.</p>

        <p>I am a conspiracy theorist AF and I believe almost all the horror stories about these vaccines... But not this one.</p>
<p>The ONLY accounts of it are very unhinged-sounding harpies on social media. Now compare that with the menstrual irregularities, GB syndrome, heart-related, thrombocytopenia, and neurological horror stories-- these are all over even in PRO-VAX social media. So far, thousands of people have said "I got a clot in my brain, but I'd do it again!" Or "I've been bleeding nonstop for a month but it's better than covid!"or "I'm having a stroke and a heart attack at the same time, that's how I know it's working!!"</p>
<p>But no where has anyone been like "my unvaxed boyfriend got thrombocytopenia 1 day after my 2nd pfizer dose, but id recommend it to anyone!" Clearly pro-covidvax people have  no self awareness and not enough sense to hear themselves already, so if this was happening they'd tell you themselves, IMO.</p>

        <p>I hope you're right. I've read a lot of stories just of people coming near vaccinated people. That's worrisome enough of a prospect</p>

        <p>Holy shit, OP, are you my brother from another mother/sister from another mister? Since we are literally in the exact same situation.</p>
<p>And to answer your question, no, I don't know for sure and I've heard the same accounts you have. Only God (and possibly the other guy) know for sure. That's exactly why us plebs get to be guinea pigs.</p>

        <p>Jeez. This'll suck. I'll basically have to self-isolate ironically if shedding can pass even from unvaccinated to unvaccinated</p>

        <p>I’m confused on what you are asking? So the vaccine uses an adeno vector to send an instruction code to your cells. These instructions are just blueprints on how to make an antibody that will attach to the covid virus particles. There is no covid in the vaccine so there is no shedding of virus, and antibodies don’t shed. I think there is a lack of understanding of what vaccines are, especially this one and I highly encourage you to do some unbiased research on it. Best of luck mate.</p>
