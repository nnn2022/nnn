    <strong>You Will Never Be "Woke" Enough For The Doomers</strong>
    <p><p>Even if you get the Fauci ouchie, that's not good enough for these fuck-tards. You've gotta carry on masking up, social distancing and staying home for them to feel safe. The two vaccine shots won't be enough either; you HAVE to keep getting the annual booster shots until your arm is a blackened, shrivelled, trackmarked twig, and if you don't offer up your remaining appendage for more booster shots you're a selfish sociopath who wants grandma to die on a ventilator.</p>
<p>In fucking fact, wearing just ONE mask isn't good enough. "Two masks good, THREE MASKS BETTER", they'll squeal. You should be donning a face-shield and bomb disposal flak jacket, too, for maximum protection. Never, ever leave the house. Order all your groceries and other essential needs straight to your doorstop, have the piss-ant peasant of a delivery driver leave whatever you've ordered on the stoop, and once you're certain he's achieved minimum safe distance (the Moon preferably), open the door and aggressively sanitize the fuck out of your food and toilet paper with a spray bottle of bleach. Your arsehole will be shredded by the caustic sandpaper sting of the disinfected toilet paper rubbing against it like a cheese grater but at least you'll know there's a very low chance of you catching and spreading the deadly Covid.</p>
<p>I'm afraid Gran is going to have to live the rest of her life in total isolation, her human contact relegated to patronizing Zoom calls on a tablet she barely knows how to use properly. Visiting her could put her life at risk; until we have ZERO COVID DEATHS WORLDWIDE and the threat has been extinguished for good, she will have to suffer in silence and solitude, and even if we do achieve that very reasonable goal we should probably be on the safe side and stick to Zoom calls. If you even dare EXPRESS sadness at this situation you're clearly a conspiracy theorist nut-job who wants to sabotage their Utopian new normal where every need is catered for by the government and people float around on hover-chairs like the fat fucks in WALL-E.</p>
<p>YOU. WILL. NEVER. PLEASE. THESE. PEOPLE.</p>
<p>So why bother trying?</p></p>
