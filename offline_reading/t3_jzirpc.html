    <strong>We're all conspiracy theorists now...</strong>
    <p><p>We've been saying it since the beginning of the ScamDemic. Every event and policy we foretold has happened. The list is long, but I'll just touch on the main items:</p>
<p>- Coverup of China's involvement in all this (right from the beginning).</p>
<p>- Tie-in of the virus with other agendas like "climate change" (they don't even try to hide this one - all part of the Great Reset, which they openly discuss).</p>
<p>- Lies about deaths, "cases", and hospitalizations (From May on, when the real numbers started to fall).</p>
<p>- Governments at all levels ruling by decree, with no oversight or recourse - trampling of basic Constitutional rights.</p>
<p>- Lockdowns (We were told "They'd never do that!")</p>
<p>- Mandatory masks - with fines, arrests, and beatings for those who don't comply.</p>
<p>- Use of the virus to gerrymander the US election results (The media still call this some sort of "right wing conspiracy theory".)</p>
<p>- Intimidation and police visits to those who question the narrative or try to organize protests.</p>
<p>- The right to literally bust down your door without a warrant, and haul you or your family away into "quarantine"</p>
<p>- Mandatory vaccines (The media is already "nudging" the public to go along with this one).</p>
<p>- "Immunity passports", and denial of services to those who refuse (All over the news; TicketMaster has already tried this, even though the vaccine isn't deployed yet).</p>
<p>- A permanent state of "War on the 'Rona", with masks, distancing, and rolling lockdowns - with no end in sight.</p>
<p>What is it that makes the average person so unable to see this? Is there some event that will open enough eyes to make a difference, or will it not happen until they and their families are herded into a Black Maria for a trip to a government "holding facility" "for their own safety"?</p>
<p>It's utterly frustrating. I just don't get it.</p></p>

        <p>They were always like this. These are the same people who would volunteer to be state agents in a dictatorship. Their true nature was just hidden under the surface of fake civility and political correctness. This event brought it out to the surface. They realized, not only that they were not alone in their nastiness, but that the vast majority of people around them were too. That the big-wigs and so-called scientists were on their side too. They got emboldened. </p>
<p>It's not that they're not seeing something. It's that they are seeing it all too clearly.</p>

        <p>I swear half of these people have never even heard of 1984. 'Freedom Passes' are now coming to fruition and people still aren't even questioning them. Dude, look at the fucking name. </p>
<p>Maybe more people are aware than we think and they're just waiting for everyone else to say something. I mean even most people in my family are somewhat against this lockdown but they still follow the rules to obviously not raise anyones eyebrows. Think of all the people out there feeling the same. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But i always have a sliver of doubt in my mind. Maybe people really are falling for it.</p>

        <p>People just aren't willing to give up their comfortable lives even in the face of great tyranny.  Over the past century, people have been so caught up in consumerism and their lives are so comfortable that no infringement on their freedoms will convince them to leave that life.  That's been the plan all along, turn us into docile sheep who will not stand up for themselves as long as they have their food and their pen.  We can see first hand, despite many people being against the lockdowns and all of this tyranny, they've made it so that you cannot live this modern comfortable life if you do not comply with the tyrants, so everyone does.</p>

        <p>Far too few people are willing to acknowledge the existence of good and evil in this world. Secular moral relativism has blinded them to the obvious fact that we are facing the most comprehensive act of evil on a scale that's never been witnessed before. They seem convinced that it's all a big "mistake".</p>

        <p>Not at all religious but doesn’t the saying go: “the road to hell is paved with good intentions”</p>
<p>The lockdowns are not an act of evil public health officials pushing for a new world order. They’re an act of ignorance, stupidity, and fear with the intention of reducing harm on a vulnerable population and health care system.</p>
<p>Labelling with good and evil is so harmful as it only further divides the world into tribes with blind stubbornness. If we were being proper scientists then we should be able to have frank and public discussions without being called evil anti-maskers who want to kill grandma.</p>

        <p>The worst part is the government outright lies. On TV they say one thing, then do the exact opposite. No one questions any of it. You try calling it out to people you know, and they think you are crazy because the actions contradict their words. No one bothers to research or think critically anymore.</p>

        <p>have yourself a review of what has been restricted and what hasn't.</p>
<p>what has been floated as things/activities to avoid.</p>
<p>if you peel this back. </p>
<p>the limits have been placed on religious gathering.</p>
<p>earning a living for yourself  </p>
<p>and they have even more than a few times claimed that your pets were carriers of the virus.</p>
<p>all of these things have always been under attack in communist countries , (yes even pet ownership) .</p>
<p>so now that i am a conspiracy nut, this might be all china's doing and a communist attempt at our civilization ?</p>
<p>and this is also exposing the Chinese conscripts in our own government doing as their told?</p>
<p>remember  Dianne Feinstein had a driver for over 15 years that was a Chinese government operative - and nothing happened about it. </p>

        <p>Fear paralyzes. These people are afraid. 
They figure, the government is telling us the truth. They believe it because they dont trust their own judgement on things. </p>
<p>If you're the average person you're terrified right now. You believe there's a deadly virus out there that can kill you and cause long term damage if you catch it. </p>
<p>So you're just going to do whatever they tell you so that you can "live". </p>
<p>Governments aren't run by dumb average people either. They're run by intelligent people who can out maneuver the dummies. </p>
<p>But people don't know what they don't know. So it is hard for them to think that another person who is much smarter than them is manipulating them and using them for a means to an end. </p>
<p>There's a lot of people right now who can see that we are being lied to. They may not know how or what is being done but they sense danger. That's why right now many nonsensical and dumb conspiracies are rising. These people are looking for leadership. They believe just about anything but their instinct tells them not to trust the government.</p>

        <p>My brother follows all the rules to "save all the grandmas." I used to think he was way smarter than me, but I'm seriously starting to question his intelligence. Every time we have a debate, he makes me question my own sanity because he is good with numbers and uses the same manipulation tactics that are being used on himself and all the other sheeple, on me. But in the end I have so much information to back up what I see going on around the world that I just can't accept the numbers. I know he's just living in fear, but it's totally fear of the wrong thing. The virus for him and his kids would probably be a mild cold.
 I also don't get how the people supposedly trying to protect the elderly cannot see that having all the care homes locked down and all those lonely old people essentially living in solitary confinement isn't far worse than a virus. THERE ARE THINGS WORSE THAN DEATH. The whole situation of living in a little room, alone, not seeing your family and being confused at what is happening and treated as if you're going to be infected at any second and then possibly dying, completely alone... is just abhorrent. I weep for what has happened to this world and how we treat our elders.</p>

        <p>I thank this virus a lot... I always wondered how Nazi Germany worked around the 1930-45. I wondered how people were okay with jewish gettos, rounding up and sending gays and jews to camps, just following every ridicoulous state law and order.</p>
<p>Well, at least now I know how it worked, because it seems to be happening again in many ways.</p>
<p>Giving up freedom, people shaming people for not wearing a mask, voluntarily taking a vaccine, etc.</p>

        <p>I dont know. The war on Rona has become a full on crusade. It used to be a joke that Rona was becoming a religious cult. Now its complete with " death to the infidels" mantra. Someone told me I was gonna die on a ventilator bc I said people were creating a lot of trash with masks and gloves- just stay home if you're sick, wash your hands, and cover your mouth if you cough or sneeze. That's the same advice experts were giving early this year before people lost their minds. </p>
<p>People have always been like this. I was against the iraq war and was called unpatriotic. I could go on until I was blue in the face about how bombing and invading a country could actually cause terrorism to no avail. And dont get my started on the War on Drugs!</p>
