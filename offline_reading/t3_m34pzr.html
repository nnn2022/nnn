    <strong>So travel for US citizens WILL spread COVID but refugees coming into the US DO NOT spread COVID???</strong>
    <p><p>Disclaimer: I am NOT against helping refugees who are trying to escape the poverty and violence in their own countries. I understand that they don't want to leave their homes and that they leave because they literally have no other choice. This post is meant to point out the inconsistencies of our government and the CDC in regards to how COVID spreads. I am NOT a Trump supporter OR a Republican. </p>
<p>So NPR news had a segment today about an increase in refugee children coming alone to our boarders. It basically blamed former President Trump for enacting Title 42 which blocks noncitizens from entering the US to prevent the spread of diseases (in this case, COVID). Now apparently the "health experts" don't think allowing people into a country spreads COVID to that country. </p>
<p>Quote from the article: "In an effort to head off a child detention crisis, like ones that challenged Presidents Obama and Trump in 2014 and 2019, the Biden administration announced it's restoring shelter capacity to pre-pandemic levels."</p>
<p>Listening to this segment today on the radio really infuriated me because not only has the government and the CDC been shaming travel of any distance this past year, but myself and millions of other American's have been forced to cancel travel plans. A year of our lives has been wasted and it's looking like a few more years will be wasted as well. Only for them to go back on everything they've said to state now that allowing refugees into the country won't increase the spread of COVID. I'm so furious right now. Either travel increases the spread or it doesn't. COVID doesn't care what the reason for travel is. It's a virus. </p>
<p>These outright LIES must STOP.</p>

        <p>YES. THIS IS EXACTLY MY POINT. I'm not against BLM but our governor was marching with the BLM protesters (which is great) while also implementing harsh restrictions on small businesses and citizens in our state. It's fucking hypocritical!</p>

        <p>Trump did and said a LOT of things that I wasn't ok with but I could support some of his decisions. He was right to block people from coming into the country to help stop the spread of COVID but liberals called him racist for it. I don't hate him. I think he opened our eyes to a lot of things that the government didn't want us to know.</p>

        <p>You like him because he said the quiet part loud. I'm with ya brother. Im not always on board with the NoNewNormal stuff, mostly joined the sub for the memes. But in a lot of ways... a <em>lot</em> of ways, he's opened the truth about it all. I'm just worried about when the shit hits the fan, and I dont think we're there yet. Biden did get one thing right, we have a dark "winter" ahead of us. But... that's the cycle of history right? Golden ages followed by dark ages.</p>

<p>The tribe that he belongs to is the same tribe that runs the World Bank and Federal Reserve and it is the same tribe that controls all media (social and traditional) in the western world. I find it highly unlikely that he would ever go against his tribe. The NWO agenda must move forward, and no one who is not on board becomes president.</p>
<p>He lost re-election because he betrayed his base, and falling in line with the Chinese covid scam was a major component of that. I voted for Trump in 2016 but in a way I'm happier that Biden won because if we are going to be letting in all of the illegals and allowing the country to be ran from Beijing/Tel-aviv then I would rather not have a "conservative" at the helm. Trump was an utter embarrassment that set back the cause of conservatism for a generation or more. He may have even killed the conservative movement completely since by the time the damage is healed, the demographic shift he failed to reverse will have relegated conservatism to permanent irrelevance.</p>

        <p>This is one of the many reasons why I'm against a two party system. Especially when we have other parties in the US. It's disappointing how most American's don't even know there are other parties. </p>
<p>Instead of a fair system we have two wealthy parties that get the most votes and attention and the poor parties who might be better for the country but aren't given nearly as much media coverage simply because they don't have enough money. I hate it.</p>

        <p>The Biden regime is doing a very good job showing Americans and the world the flaws of the two party system. It‚Äôs a big disservice to our international colleagues for the US to enter into agreements like the Paris accord, Iran nuclear deal, be a part of the WHO in one regime, have the next administration get us out of those organizations in an attempt to reclaim our sovereignty, only to have the next regime have the US reenter all of these bad deals.</p>
<p>We have a constitutional process for treaties and other agreements, but the government during the Obama years never used said process because they knew full well they wouldn‚Äôt pass.</p>

        <p>Yeah, well it sucks but its mildly OK compared to other countries. In mexico they have a nearly identical system to ours but numerous political parties. </p>
<p>This makes them harder to keep track of and theyll often flip-flop and make backroom deals with other parties that nobody knows about til its too late. Or a dominant party will subjugate smaller ones and the smaller ones will do deals that conflict with eachother's interests, simply to depose the dominant power, screwing their entire base over in the process. Its a fantastic mess and I'm not even sure that its better than 2 parties.</p>

<p>If Repubs were smart they would make a new work-visa program and work to get manufacturing back to US through tax-reduction incentives and reducing the minimum-wage for immigrants to make it financially viable. </p>
<p>They could dramatically cut the amount of illegal immigration while securing an entirely new voter-base while appeasing big-business interests. </p>

        <p>I'm likely ignorant of the politics regarding this, but wouldn't the US also control immigration if we actively did something about the governments of these countries the immigrants are running from? We had no issue invading countries in the Middle East and messing with their governments but have we ever tried to do that in Mexico or South America? Then those citizens might not have to come to the US. </p>

        <p>Its a valid question and one that I asked myself while trying to comprehend the situation. Basically, the situation is this. Merging latin america into the US would be a universal nightmare for everyone for tons of reasons. Its just not a viable solution for anyone. </p>
<p>Any decisive military action to defeat the cartels (which the majority of corruption comes from) would lead to millions dead and a large scale humanitarian crisis at the border, the likes of which we havent ever seen. The cartels would resort to terrorism, detonating bombs in population centers etc.,  to demonize the US as invaders, imperialists, racists, etc. </p>
<p>Thats why now the powers that be have decided to work with certain cartels who want to keep things quiet, while enforcing against more violent cartels. Ever wonder why cartels rarely target US law enforcement? Thats why. </p>
<p>The only real solution to remove the largest source of corruption in latin america is for the US to stop consuming illegal drugs, which is impossible. This was one of the rationales behind Reagan's war on drugs, which was a disaster. </p>
<p>CIA/FBI/DEA are already involved in latin america, mainly just to protect the US own interests by keeping the bloodshed from spilling past the border. Theyre not interested in defeating them because its just not feasible. In many cases they help move the drugs to finance black operations and build relationships with 'friendly' cartels so they will cooperate with us. </p>
<p>Basically, we've opted to swing the situation to our favor, rather than defeating it entirely. Which if Repubs were smart, they would do the same with illegal immigration, rather than living in some fantasy land where there is a magical wall that keeps everything out.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the informative response! I knew the US profits off of essentially working with the cartels. I didn't realize how much more powerful the cartels could be vs the US military. It's just horrible that there doesn't seem to be a way to fix things so that people don't have to run from their countries. I think your ideas make more sense than the wall. I don't think that a wall would help anyone.</p>

        <p>Its also a problem that the most ambitious and hardworking people simply leave the country as soon as they can. So the most talented people in latin america serve other nations and not their own. Its the equivalent of all our best minds and workers leaving to work for another nation. It would create a big problem for us in terms of development. So there is really no solution that would make everyone totally haply. </p>
<p>Again though, all of this is a result of the US consumption of drugs. We essentially took our drug problem and pushed the worst parts of it south of the border. </p>
<p>There is just too much money to be made in drugs so the most powerful oligarchs in mexico are all drug trafficers. Its like trillions of dollars a year on low estimates.</p>
<p>Even the military commanders are corrupt because of the money and I dont blame them on some level. They pay policemen around 3,000 USD a week to supply them with information and do favors. If your normally making 500 a month with your government salary with no pension and they say take the money or we murder you, what would you do?</p>
