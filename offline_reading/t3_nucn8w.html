<p>Bummer. Most school districts in NY were going to keep masks anyway, but still a bummer.</p></p>

        <p>Why does anybody listen to those clowns at the CDC? They took until about a month ago to say that COVID was airborne.</p>

        <p>On Friday, it seemed that NY state was going to drop the mask mandate unless the CDC came  up with some convincing evidence about why NY should keep it. </p>
<p>Now, all the CDC has to do is not respond to NY's letter for the next three weeks, until school ends on June 25.</p>
<p>In fact, I'm pretty sure that's exactly what the CDC will do, because I doubt the CDC has any real data or evidence about why schools need masks.</p>

        <p>Since the beginning of this whole lockdown shitshow, Cuomo has REPEATEDLY stated that NYS will NOT rely on the CDC for recommendations, and that ALL covid measures in NYS will be decided by the state department of health. And that's exactly what he's done since spring 2020.</p>
<p>But now suddenly it's "wait for the CDC to respond?"</p>
<p>He's just fucking with people's heads now.</p>

        <p>I think half the reason the CDC wanted masks through the rest of the school year is because most school districts only had two weeks or something to go at the time of the CDC's big announcement.</p>
<p>However, NY ends school literally a month later than a lot of places.</p>
<p>The CDC is now saying masks shouldn't be mandatory (but should be "highly encouraged" or something like that) in summer camps even for unvaccinated people. In a lot of states, summer camps are occurring right now.</p>
<p>Why should a summer camp in, say, Ohio not require masks right now, while NY schools should have to require masks for the next three weeks? It really doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>
