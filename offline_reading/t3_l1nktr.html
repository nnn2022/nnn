    <strong>How the Irish People were Psychologically Manipulated</strong>
    <p><p>I want to bring to your attention an article that<a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/article/breaking-covid-trance-how-irish-people-were-psychologically-manipulated"> UK Column</a> published on January 6th.</p>
<p>The article highlights how the Irish were Gaslighted by the Media. I strongly encourage you to read slowly and carefully my edited version (18k words down to 10k).</p>
<p>There is a lot of information in this interview, and for somebody who is a non-native english speaker, it can be hard to distill all the key points.</p>
<p><strong>It highlights in bold the key points, to aid the reader throughout the lengthy document</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://wakingireland.wordpress.com/2021/01/21/how-the-irish-people-were-psychologically-manipulated/">Link to edited version of John Anthony's Stages of Gaslighting</a></p>
<p>I'll post some of the article below here.</p>
<h1>John Anthony Interview (Edited)</h1>
<p>You can look at it from an individual point of view where you have relationships going on around the country, and you have people who are abusive, and you have victims. On a slightly larger scale, then you have family dynamics, and you can have narcissistic abusive dynamics in a family.</p>
<p>These are not psychiatric conditions. We’re not trying to label anybody here, we're trying to <strong>find words to describe a model</strong>. We’re trying to put a structure on this, or a kind of map, so that people can begin to understand that there’s a very great preciseness about this, that there’s a predictability, a way of looking at this, and this has been known in psychology for quite some time.</p>
<p>There’s a man called Ross Rosenberg, and he brought out a model called<a href="http://humanmagnetsyndrome.com/"> The Human Magnet Syndrome</a>. And everybody is <em>somewhere</em> on the scale in this. On the extreme end of the scale, you have <strong>psychopathy</strong> — very manipulative people, who are the rarer ones. And then you have <em>narcissistic</em> people, who are self-entitled, grandiose and they are <strong>manipulators</strong>, you come down to a basic structure in their personalities and their behaviour that they’re looking for <strong><em>control, attention and manipulation</em></strong>. That would be qualities at one extreme end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>And then you come to the centre, and you have <strong>most people in the centre, who are empathetic</strong>, who can have differences with people, who can be slightly manipulative at times. But these are ordinary people, who get on with life. They have a certain amount of empathy, they can say sorry to others, and things like that.</p>
<h1>The narcissistic personality</h1>
<p>Up at the extreme end, you don’t have that: you have people who are very much afraid of being blamed, who don’t take responsibility for themselves, who are grandiose and entitled in their behaviour. And what has happened — there was a Dr Ramani [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DoctorRamanDurvasula">Ramani Durvasula</a>] who talks about this, and she says that sometimes this becomes endemic in society, and <strong>we start to praise, and to get a value system around, hard-nosed people who can ‘do the job and get on with it’</strong>.</p>
<p>There’s a value system that puts the value on the hard-nosed achiever who manipulates things for themselves, and you put them on a pedestal.</p>
<h2>Psychopathy</h2>
<p>People who have this psychopathic tendency, and on down the spectrum a bit towards the narcissistic tendency — <strong>they become clustered</strong>, that in other words <strong>they find each other in positions of power, because that’s what they like: control, positions of power and trust</strong>. And when you think back on the recent history of Ireland: you had the priests who were found to be paedophiles, you had the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Secours_Mother_and_Baby_Home"> Tuam scandal</a>, you had<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Smyth"> Brendan Smyth</a>. You had people who were beyond reproach, and this was part of the problem.</p>
<p>These people were looked up to: they were the moral theologians; they were the moral police, the moral advisers. So, people of this nature — the <strong>narcissistic, psychopathic</strong>, that kind of nature, began to <strong>cluster</strong> in these areas. Now that was only one area.</p>
<h1>The other end of the scale</h1>
<p>And then you go down to the other end of the scale, and this is where it’s interesting now, because that’s what’s happening. At the other end of the scale, you have the <strong><em>compliant</em></strong>, the <strong><em>empathetic</em></strong>, the person who wants to please people. And these would be the people who — when they hear the authority speaking, telling them to ‘Wear your mask’ — they would be the people who say, ‘we’ll pull together and we’ll do it.’ <strong>Because these people have great empathy for each other, for other people, they want to solve the problem. They want to please the narcissist</strong>.</p>
<p>And this is where the dance begins: the group at one end, the compliant, empathetic, want to solve the problem think that if they do it right this time the person that they’re listening to, the authority — the NHS or the HSE, the health authorities — or the politicians, will be pleased, because these are the ones that are rolling out the instructions: to tell us to wear masks, to lock up our elderly people, to not have freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Now, that kind of dance between the two types of individuals has a very precise and predictable nature about it. And I’m talking here about people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder — it is not a psychiatric condition. Anybody can live like this and never do anything much out of the way. But if it becomes something that overtakes them, then they can do an awful lot of damage. And that’s where you hear phrases like ‘narcissistic abuse’: you often hear that in family dynamics.</p>
<h1>Stages of the abuse cycle</h1>
<p>In the first part of the relationship is what’s called the <strong>love bombing</strong> or the <strong>idealisation phase</strong>, or the <strong>identification phase</strong>, where they say, ‘Oh, you’re wonderful’, or, ‘Everything is terrific about you’, ‘We’re soulmates’, and things like that.</p>
<p>The narcissistic person, the abusive person, gathers information from the other person. Now, they do it intuitively, some of these people, they do it by default. Some of them can be very manipulative and do it deliberately. But a lot of the time, this happens because of the nature of the two personalities.</p>
<h1>Love Bombing Phase</h1>
<p>Everything is great in the love bombing stage: the empathetic person feels they have found somebody that understands them, and listens to them, and the narcissistic person is listening to them and gathering information about this person, and begins to understand them and give sense to the information about them.</p>
<p>The second part of the process kicks in because the narcissistic person cannot maintain the persona. It’s a false persona that they produce: they’re massively insecure people, there’s no doubt about that; <strong>they need attention, control, and manipulation</strong> in order to validate who they are. This is very important: ‘I feel alive!’ and ‘I feel loved!’, but <strong>any kind of questioning, or any kind of criticism</strong>, by Jove, they take it very seriously. And they take what’s called ‘<strong>narcissistic insult</strong>’.</p>
<p>In any normal intimate relationship, this begins to break down, because of the fact that you’re dealing with a <strong>false personality</strong> to begin with. If they understand that you’re interested in literature, they will have a book under their arm and it’ll be something along the lines of what they heard you talking about, and they’ll say, ‘This is very interesting.’ So they’re <strong>ingratiating</strong> themselves with the other person.</p>
<p>Now, this is on the <strong>micro</strong> level. We’ll come to the political level in a minute, because it’s exactly the same.</p>
<p>Think about that for a moment — that kind of ingratiation, that kind of love bombing — and think of the speech that Leo Varadkar made to the nation, and all the other speeches that other politicians made, when they were doling out the love bombing of, ‘We are with you!’ This was the phrase that he used in his St Patrick’s Day speech, when he spoke about the ‘coming calamity’. And he said, ‘And it will come!’</p>
<p>That’s on the <strong>macro</strong> level: you’re talking about society. That’s where you identify with people, and you begin to say, ‘We’re all in together’, and ‘We’re all together in this.’</p>
<p>.</p>
<h1>Phase 2A: Victim Starts to Identify With and Please the Abuser</h1>
<p>On the Ryan Tubridy Show: he was talking about looking in at Nana and Grandad and waving, and the children and they were all so happy — building this <strong>framework</strong>. And the <strong>compliant person fits themselves into their framework</strong>, and that’s the beginning of the second part of the process. On an individual level, it can be six months, or something like that. And again, because of the <strong>insecurity that they feel, they begin this process of denigration</strong>, the process of <strong>devaluing the partner</strong> that they have begun to <strong>target and control</strong>. And, because this person is compliant, he will begin to [devalue her] — we’re assuming here, by the way, that the target is a woman and the narcissist is a man, but it can be the other way around.</p>
<h1>Phase 2B: Devaluation</h1>
<p>The abuser begins the <strong>denigration</strong> process, which is the <strong>control</strong> process, and he sees how it’s taking, he’s monitoring this all the time, and the abuse then begins to creep in. <strong>This is</strong> <strong>covert</strong> <strong>stuff when they begin the denigration process and the devaluing</strong>, but at that stage the compliant person — the impact on the empathic person, who’s doing their best to keep it all together — they’re <strong>beginning to get addicted to the narcissist</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? Because they say, ‘Well, he was so wonderful, and he did all sorts of things for me and he bought me this and that, and now it’s beginning to break down*’* but <strong>they will make excuses for them</strong>. <strong>They will become an apologist for the narcissist</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The hardest person to convince that they’re in this trap,</strong> from a therapeutic point of view**, is when you get** <strong>somebody in front of you</strong> and <strong>they’re</strong> <strong>making excuses</strong> <strong>for their partner</strong> and they have a black eye.</p>
<p>I remember working with somebody once who had actually been beaten up and they made the excuse, ‘I wasn’t so very good; I did this and I did that,’ and <strong>they were actually blaming themselves</strong>, and that’s what happens and that is so horrific to even hear.</p>
<p>That is the honeymoon period — you’re lured in and then you’re the soulmate and everything is fine, and then the denigration is covert and it’s also done in a way that it <strong>makes the empathic person, or the compliant person, feel that the other person is doing it for their good, right?</strong> So I can say to somebody: let’s say, if I was a narcissist and I was in this abusive cycle with somebody, I would begin to say, ‘Now, darling, you were never much good at that, really, if the truth be told. But I can get you help with that’.</p>
<h2>We Will Now Support You By Terrorising You</h2>
<p>Now, this seems as if I’m doing some good. Recall here what was done with the elderly in the beginning — ‘<strong>We’re doing it to keep you safe</strong>. Stay safe and it’s only a couple of weeks and we’ll get you through it.’ And some of the politicians came out and they said that these vehicles, all this <strong>extra security</strong>, right, and the Guards and soldiers — we’re having these vehicles … What were they for? Well they were to <strong>‘support the community’</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, that is totally right in the centre of this process that I’m talking about. It’s the very same thing on an individual level. The abuser begins to put the person down. They begin to isolate them, right? This is a given, it’s a known sort of process, and it’s very predictable. They begin to <strong>isolate them from their family</strong>. That’s one of the signs. They <strong>isolate them from their society</strong>. So the abuser would suggest something like, ‘We’ll go away somewhere and we’ll go to a different part of the country. And you won’t have to put up with those parents you have or those brothers and sisters you have. We’d be far better off on our own, and things will be idyllic when we get there.’</p>
<h2>Let’s get you nicely cut off</h2>
<p>When you do that, when you get there, this isolation begins then the abuse begins to get worse, because now they have you under more control. They have you <strong>isolated from your peers</strong>, <strong>from your family</strong>, from things like that. On the national level, that’s exactly what they’ve rolled out: the second phase was brought in; everybody was being told, ‘You can’t go out.’ Older people that we held in our esteem, and people that we loved, Nanas and Grandads and parents, you know. And one friend of mine mentioned, ‘I haven’t seen my mother in three weeks.’ This was kind of during the process, and he said, ‘It’s all this Corona stuff.’</p>
<p>And I said, ‘It’s <em>not</em> the corona stuff,’ quite openly to him. ‘I blame the lockdown. If you want to blame anything, blame the lockdown. That’s what it’s doing: it’s isolating people, it’s keeping them locked up. <strong>Forget about the Coronavirus just for the moment</strong>. That’s the first thing you [should] do, and then you take whatever precautions you think are necessary. But just weigh it up and blame it where belongs’</p>
<p>This is all evident for anybody who goes through the archives and listens for the last six months, from March until now. Listen to the interviews: listen to how it’s being said. Micheál Martin definitely said — I remember it distinctly — ‘<strong>It’s not the Irish Government that’s doing the lockdowns;</strong> <strong>it’s the virus</strong>.’</p>
<p>The abuse has begun, and it is very, very pervasive. They are instilling fear into the population. So the question is now, how exactly are they doing that?</p>
<h2>How Fear Is Instilled</h2>
<p>Yes, we know that they’re saying they’re afraid the HSE will be overwhelmed, they’re afraid the hospitals will be overwhelmed, and the last time they were talking about this, the hospitals were empty, and we all assumed, ‘They made a mistake about that; we’ll get on with it.’.</p>
<p>This wave, if you like, is over. The virus is over; it’s gone. It has produced a curve like any other year, and then it’s flattened out. We’re looking at this at the moment, and now we should be asking ourselves, ‘What’s the lockdown about <em>now</em>?’</p>
<p>So we get on to the third phase. The devaluation, I would say, has almost come to an end, and we get to the third stage, and this goes for whether you look at it from the personal, individual breakdowns and abusiveness. If you or look at it on the macro level and you’re looking at politicians and the way society is working. I don’t look outside Ireland so much. I’m looking at what’s happening in Ireland and this is not a theory — what we’re looking at <em>is</em> the last six months.</p>
<h1>Phase 3: The Abuse Increases</h1>
<p>The third phase is when the <strong>abuse increases</strong>, and you have things like <strong>abandonment</strong>. </p>
<p>Ghosting: meaning that the person in the relationship goes away, they spend a couple of days away. The wife may not know where they are, you know? And he comes back and he says, ‘Oh …’ and, again, <strong>watch the language: they will</strong> <strong><em>never take responsibility</em></strong> <strong>for what they have done</strong>. Very often, they will apologise in one way, and say, you know, ‘I was away, but if you weren’t so picky, and hadn’t such a temper and nagged me so much, I wouldn’t have to go away, if things were normal.’ Now, all of a sudden, it’s the partner’s fault.</p>
<p>This is the third phase, the abandonment phase, which is where they can dole out abuse of all sorts. They can go away — infidelity might be part of it. And this is where the compliant person begins to hit rock bottom. Because they have been trying to do everything according to the abuser. They have, in a way, <strong>abandoned their own experience and their own judgement</strong>, because each time that they do something, they’ll say to themselves, ‘Well, that’s a very simple thing. I should have known that he doesn’t eat steak for his dinner, and I put on a steak — and I forgot, really, and there was a blow-up.’</p>
<p>And now the person is beginning to enter into a phase where they’re so <strong>unsure of themselves, where the goalposts are constantly changing and where the confusion is mounting in them</strong>, and they <em>do not know</em>, because of this addiction, because of this <strong>ideal that they had about the person, that they had in the beginning</strong> — it’s holding the map in place, if you like. But they do not know, and they are beginning to blame themselves.</p>
<h1>Scare Them Witless For Starters</h1>
<p>The first way is with a <strong>fright</strong>, so you introduce something that causes fear — like, ‘The coronavirus is coming, it’s going to wipe out …’ I heard figures at the beginning like ‘600,000 people will be affected’, and all this sort of thing, but this was the projection. When you introduce fear, you can then <strong>suggest something to those people, and that suggestion will go in at a very deep level</strong>.</p>
<p>So we have to lock up our elderly; we have to stop people from working; there’s a whole list of things which they have done: they’ve taken away our free speech, they took away our traditions. We did it on the back of fear, so they introduced fear. The fear had us all running around: it’s the very same today, that fear is on the go.</p>
<h2>Phase 4: Abuser Cycles Nice, Abusive and N/A phases</h2>
<h2>Allowed today, verboten tomorrow</h2>
<p>Now, the second one is where you introduce <strong>confusion</strong>. So I say to you today, you cannot travel more than two kilometres from your house. If you’re over 70, you can’t leave the house at all, and as I’m going along I’m introducing other things, and some of them don’t make sense, right? You’re saying to yourself, ‘Well, how could that be? I mean, that’s not right!’ Now, the <strong>introduction of that confusion leaves you open to further suggestions</strong>, so that you can go in there and say, ‘Well now this is what you should be doing.’</p>
<p>I’ve heard it on RTÉ again: our friend Ryan Tubridy — I saw people there, and they were great, they were all doing the right thing — you’re introducing this kind of phraseology: ‘doing the right thing’. </p>
<p>I noticed when I was dropping someone up to the airport to get a flight that they had signs across the M1. They’d usually say ‘15 minutes to the airport’ or ‘Half an hour to the airport’, or maybe the number of kilometres. But what’s up there now? What’s right across the M1? And <strong>this is where programming becomes so invasive and pervasive in our lives</strong>.</p>
<p>‘Stay Safe’, ‘Hold Firm’ and ‘Protect Each Other’.</p>
<p>Now, that’s using every aspect that they can use to bring this fear-mongering, this control, into place, and that is at the stage of where you have introduced the fright. You have introduced the three things: you’ve introduced <strong>confusion</strong>, <strong>fear</strong>, and the last thing — and hopefully this won’t happen — but you introduce a stage where what they say that the <strong>bodily integrity is broken</strong>. </p>
<p>In other words, somebody comes along and they are in a park they shouldn’t be in, or they’re on a train and they’re not wearing a mask and they refuse to wear it and things like that, and the Guards [Gardaí, police] are called. And I heard Rowan and he had Melissa on, who had a child at home who <strong>needed pain medication</strong>, she didn’t have a mask. I think that was the issue, and the Guards were called.</p>
<h1>Invading The Victim’s Bodily Integrity</h1>
<p>So now the <strong>bodily integrity is beginning to get threatened</strong>. And this is one of the final places where, when everything is threatened, <strong>whatever is said goes in very deeply</strong>. And if you can get that going at a macro level in the political scene, then you’ve got the third thing, the third point by which people can be deeply programmed. So you’ve got the confusion, people trying to do the right thing, and then they say, ‘That’s not what it was last week,’ and, ‘No, I don’t like the feeling of this, they say they are locking us up.’ </p>
<p>I know 70-year-olds who are much fitter than I am, and they were being locked up in their houses. Simon Harris came on in the beginning, and he said, I remember this distinctly — this is at the height of the beautiful summer that we had, and we weren’t in Hong Kong where we could think it’s because of the smog or whatever; we have a beautiful Atlantic breeze coming in here in the West [of Ireland] — he said, ‘Normally, yes, going out in the fresh air is good for you, having your family around and supporting you is normally good for you and exercise is good for you; but just for the next couple of weeks we’re going to just lock you down and you can’t leave the house.’ Now, that was what was said, that’s what he did.</p>
<h1>The Still,Small Voice of Reality</h1>
<p>It wasn’t the coronavirus that did it: they implemented this stuff and they rolled it out, and this is what made people feel bad. This is what denigrates people, they come away intuitively knowing, ‘Yeah, I know they said that they were going to help us and they’re doing it all for us to protect us’ But something is ringing in the back of their head saying, ‘This is bullshit’.</p>
<h1>Reverse-engineering of Therapy</h1>
<p>Now, when you have that kind of situation, <strong>you can be taken by the narrative: the narrative is Covid</strong>, oh my God, you’re taken by it, and you go with the story. And when you’re going with the story, you forget to use your own intuition, your own critical thinking. And you go with the story because of the <strong>fear</strong>, because of <strong>confusion</strong> and because your <strong>bodily integrity</strong> can be also threatened, which is the Guards and security and extra vehicles.</p>
<p>That’s how programming is done. You do it in a hypnotherapeutic sense, you do it with the client sitting in front of you. But you’re <strong>doing it for their upliftment</strong>, for their enhancement, to empower them to do whatever they need to do, you do it for a different purpose altogether. So wherever you have two people communicating, wherever you have societies talking to each other, this kind of interaction goes on in a very normal way; but when it’s done in an insidious way, and when it’s done with the government in collusion with the mainstream media and the HSE, that has my mind boggled, it really has.</p>
<h1>The Abusers Have Left a Defence Mechanism Behind</h1>
<p>If you’re programmed, you know — as we have explained about the pervasiveness of the programming that’s going on — we can talk about what I’ve heard them saying on the radio and the TV, having gone through the [first] six months, where they’re <strong>not asking questions</strong>, where they’re just <strong>programming fear</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, this is where the real manipulation comes in, because this has to be contrived. It has to be a contrivance, it has to be a collusion, it has to be done very precisely; and that’s what I think is happening in the mainstream media. What I think is that the contrivance blanket, the collusion, is so massive that even I find it hard to believe that presenters and people on the mainstream media that I know — have gotten drawn into this and are now doing it in such a way that there are no questions being asked.</p>
<h1>The Three Minds</h1>
<p>If I can just divert a little bit for the moment, to answer your question. The three minds. </p>
<p>The <strong><em>conscious</em></strong> mind that we feel with every day of our lives, [when] we are consciously doing stuff. </p>
<p>And we have the <strong><em>emotional</em></strong> mind and the <strong><em>reptilian</em></strong> mind. The reptilian mind is the most basic survival instinct that you can get. There is a very famous American hypnotist who says if you get control of the reptilian mind — if you can communicate with the reptilian mind — [then] the reptilian mind rules the roost. And it’s a bit like when you’re in your house and you look down on the ground and there is a rope. And for that second, the reptilian mind will pounce in with that ‘Snake!’ It’s your survival instinct. It <strong>gets the message through to you</strong>, and then  you make a jump and you say ‘Oh my God!’, and then a few seconds later you say, ‘Oh, sure I thought it was a snake!’</p>
<p>So that’s the kind of scenario you have: the <strong>reptilian mind gets there first</strong>, it gets there in a nanosecond, <strong>before the conscious mind</strong> has made up its mind about anything. </p>
<p>The reptilian mind in regards to programming, it asks the questions. </p>
<p><em>Is it safe?</em> ‘No, it’s not safe at all because you have this coronavirus and it’s going to kill and affect so many people, and we have 200 more cases today’. This stimulates the survival instinct.</p>
<p>The next question is, ‘Can I eat it?’ ‘Is it going to be of some benefit to me?’ It’s a reptilian response: is this going to be dangerous, or is this going to be safe?</p>
<p>And the last question, where marketing comes in a big way — they say, ‘Well, can I mate with it? They are the three basic primal things, and they get there before anything else, which is what keeps you safe: it makes you jump!</p>
<h1>Control</h1>
<p>Now, if you have been programmed at this big level, ‘Coronavirus is coming, it’s not safe, it’s not safe to go outside!’, [then] you have elderly people and other people that won’t even go out shopping — to this day — that used to go out shopping, that used to go to the pub. They have no pub to go to now, they are <strong>isolated from their families</strong>.</p>
<p>All the characteristics of abuse have been put in place, and it’s <em>control.</em> And when you have that, it <strong>explains the ineffectiveness of you coming out with a statement that is just logical</strong>.</p>
<p>Conscious: your critical mind is just working, and you say the virus hasn’t killed anybody at the moment, [deaths] are down, we have no new deaths, even though we have new <em>cases</em> and the cases can be put down to the suspect test, the PCR test. And <strong>you say this, but that’s all on the</strong> <strong><em>logical</em></strong> <strong>level</strong>, when in actual fact they have been <strong>programmed almost on this</strong> <strong><em>primal</em></strong> <strong>level, this</strong> <strong><em>instinctual</em></strong> <strong>level</strong>. It kicks in, and that’s when you get this ‘Oh my God, do you hear what he’s saying!’.</p></p>
