        <p>I like this meme. I feel like it's not biased to one side of the argument or the other, neither pro- nor anti-mask.</p>
<p>It's universal. We're all very frustrated and angry by the current state of things, and masks do muffle your voice. The woman without the mask is in hysterics, like we've all seen people doing in stores. The masked woman is frail and sickly looking, with what seems like fear in her eyes, basically exactly the negative portrayal of pro-mask people we're all also familiar with. It's two screaming Karens, acting out the extremes of both sides.</p>
<p>A+ COVID meme!</p>

        <p>by forcing him to inhale microplastics from these facemasks. And by destroying the environment he's in. Don't you know what's going on?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8548139/Face-masks-remnants-guts-sharks.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8548139/Face-masks-remnants-guts-sharks.html</a></p>
<p><em>Widely-available face masks feature a layer of non-woven bonded fabric – commonly made of polypropylene – which gives them a long afterlife when they are discarded and can end up in landfill or oceans.</em>  </p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/</p>
<p><em>Dyspnea variation was significantly higher with surgical mask (+5.6 vs.  +4.6; P&lt;0.001) and the difference was clinically relevant.</em> </p>
<p>That's only after few minutes walking with healthy subjects</p>
<p>So who's going to pay for the damages both at health and also the damage to environment.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask detriments physical performance. I've try it. I consider equivalent to smoking cigarettes.</p>

And I do know what is going on because I'm wearing a face mask in public (and not coughing in someone's face when the ask me to), staying in my lockdown, being hygienic, and social distancing when I can. But that doesn't mean I don't think you don't know what's going on, I think you know well good what's going on and you are just whining about it like a little cry baby you disgusting Karen</p>

        <p>Really because nothing of what I said has nothing that be says mask are dangerous, and neither did the links and how are the links by the most trusted scientific sources "spammy".
And mate I hate the government, right I despise the Tory's and want indiref 2 more than anyone it's just that when it comes to independent scientific sources come out and say something that I can prove then that's when I support the government, like if they came out and said you have to wear clothes in a hypothetical time when wearing clothes saves lives all of you troglodytes on this sub would declare yourselves naturists</p>

<p>&rt;masks have barely any recorded deaths</p>
<p>Government claimed the same for smoking, in fact when lawsuits started against tobacco companies, the government prohibited its scientists to testify in the court of law, for the hazards of smoking. Earlier I showed you the data that masks detriment physical performance and therefore damage health directly. I also showed you how disposable facemasks are causing environmental damage. And here is another one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X20306354">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025326X20306354</a></p>
<p>And that after just few months of mask propaganda. The environmental destruction because of micro-plastics is immense and there will be no easy way to reverse it. You are contributing to this disaster with spreading misinformation and lies.</p>
<p>Facemasks are more damaging than smoking if you take the constant use and environment into account.</p>

And you're saying I'm contributing to an eventual judgement day while you're also saying there a higher chance of judgement day than you getting infected, sooooo it looks like you getting deseases mate.</p>
<p>A way to determine who is right is who has more sources proving their point, so fire away give me alot of articles and studies because I'm ready and I can safely guess I have many more than sources than the highest number you can count to</p>

<p>Based on your trolling I will get infected? Yeah right, maybe you should watch what you're smoking.</p>
<p>You pharma-gov propaganda equates to zero. The facts is what matters. And it's easy to prove why masks are unhealthy the way they are used. Wear one vs not wear one and there is a difference in physical performance. Dead easy to prove. So facemasks are unhealthy.</p>

        <p>Well I told you facemasks detriment physical performance which means they ruin my health. And you participate in this facemask propaganda.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I'm underaged and I've never touched a cigarette </p>
<p>Those you're posting for, have created the smoking pandemic in the past, in the same way they've created this pandemic of masking now. And before that the opioids epidemic and and the obesity epidemic and the vaping epidemic etc. They are the same corrupt government officials pushing drugs and sickness methods to people.</p>
<p>A pandemic doesn't create itself. It is made.</p>

<p>Do you know what underage means it means I am not legally old enough smoke yet you listed off a bunch of things that the boomers in the governments do</p>
</li>

<p>You are right there but it isn't mass hysteria that created the virus it was a lack of understanding in the early days then a lack of people caring when it was growing and now people like you are the ones who are furthering the spread of the virus, Thai pandemic is real and there is overwhelming evidence to support that</p>

        <p>Why you think your age matters? What you do matters. </p>
<p>I don't get sick by some virus because your government claims so. In fact I am a living proof that I am not infected and it's not going to happen as I said. I won't vouch for everyone but what I am saying here is a fact. </p>
<p>And honestly I have no idea where you get any evidence that I am infected or I was infected or I might be infected and transmit disease etc. Where do you get that from? If I post a bunch of BS on my site will you believe it?</p>
<p>You can't go around accusing people of carrying a disease without proof.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; a lack of people caring </p>
<p>If a person doesn't care about himself, you can't fix it. He will become sick and it's his choice. Why do you care? If you know how to take care of your body, it means you can stay healthy and no infectious disease can touch you, ever. Did you see the doctor smoking in that picture? Now, how would you think he would advise patients on health matters? He wouldn't, because he prescribes drugs not health. </p>
<p>So that's why now many fear some virus. Because they no longer trust their body. But we are not all the same. People are different.</p>

<p>At no point did I say you were infected with the virus</p>

<p>You misinterpreted that, I was saying that when the virus first came to the us and the UK people didn't really care, they didn't think it would become big and I thought that but I doubt you did because you were still learning the alphabet back then</p>

<p>Look, when you care about your health, you do things and you can prove that your physical performance is at such levels that no virus can possibly infect you (unless you are there is an accident or injury). </p>
<p>But as you can see when you listen to your GP (who apparently promoted cigarette smoking) what do you expect to happen? To stay healthy? Before covid what was the government advice to the public? You think obesity or opioids or other substances were an objective public's choice? It wasn't. The medical system has caused 100% of these problems. The number one mortality reason is MD directive treatments. Well above heart disease.</p>
<p>What are the essential businesses during lockdown?  Lets see....Drugstores, Liquor and Tobacco stores, Junk food chains and outlets. These are called "essential businesses". Sports are prohibited, gyms are closed, athletic events are not allowed and police will arrest you if you go to a park and they impose curfews and fines for going out. And then facemasks make you inhale plastics and compromise your respiratory function and damage the environment. So what do you expect to happen? Covid is not the problem the gov authority is. And that's what caused all this.</p>
