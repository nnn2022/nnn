    <strong>Job I am trying to return to after a year is saying they are requiring the vaccine to return. Is this legal?</strong>
    <p><p>I live on one of the Hawaiian islands. The business I worked for last year (think zipline tour company) has been shut down for almost 13 months now due to lack of tourism. </p>
<p>It's finally going to start back up in April. They have told me that I must get the vaccine if I want to return as a tour guide.  </p>
<p>Is this legal? Do I have any way to deny it and still work there? Help!</p></p>

        <p>100% it is illegal because this is not an FDA certified vaxx and just under EUA. They can only suggest the jab but can't force you to take it nor make it mandatory, especially if you are here in the US. Note: This is a different story once it is FDA certified and approved (at the end of 2023).</p>

        <p>My work is really getting scary with their pro vax push. They've made it so the unvaxxed can't even go out of state even though states lifted their mandates. I mean, you can, but you have to quarantine. I don't work from home so I would be fucked. Of course I will travel wherever TF I want, but the fact they had the balls to email us that is insane. And the new covid test machine will undoubtedly be used to test the shit out of us who refuse. Still waiting on an email about why those showed up weeks ago.</p>

        <p>I think the pro vaxx agenda is serving two purposes, one is the illusion from tptb that know the purpose of the vaxx and the outcome of it and two which is the major issue is those that have fallen to the illusion that the vaxx is the save all and be all solution to freedom which is clearly a lie... can you refuse the testing? I've heard some pretty fucky stuff with the test swabs itself, never gotten the test myself but I did get a antibody test which is a blood prick one similar to how someone would check their blood sugar</p>

        <p>I read that legally they can require the test, but not the vaccine. I'd ask to work from home, but I hate the phones (and their god awful management and micromanagement) and really love all my hands on work. I'm basically in charge of the entire operation plus ordering everything and also lots of filing. My only coworker calls out all the time and is slow as shit. He's bare minimum and won't even learn anything new. Drives me and my supervisor crazy, but he seems to be untouchable because of medical issues and possibly race. </p>
<p>I may ask if I can do an antibody test instead. They're control freaks though so who knows. I love that damn job. This is really depressing me. I'm so pissed already that even if I do feel sick, I will just come in. They don't even monitor the temperature check machine or give two shits if people sound sick. That's because my office is one of the small ones that doesn't have dick management around. Thank god for that.</p>

        <p>I genuinely didn't know that about the test but that's good to know. At this point I've been working from home since last March and I don't even know when I would be going into the office and since I can get my work done remotely (I work in IT) it doesn't even make sense to go back into the office and I'd ask to work remotely anyways if that ever happens. Glad to hear that they don't do temp checks and the other security theater stuff but hope they don't enforce wearing masks the entire day, that would genuinely be inhumane...</p>

        <p>They do require temp checks (huge, no touch stand up one with gd face recognition with a mask) but my office is tiny and lax. They wouldn't notice if I forgot to do it once in awhile. They require masks, but only if you leave your desk and can't stay six feet apart. I'm so thankful they dropped the mask requirement down to that after the first month or two. I was absolutely miserable in a mask but quitting would've been financial suicide. They have the majority of us bent the fuck over.</p>
