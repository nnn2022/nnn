    <p><p>2019: I’m a grown ass adult I can make my own decisions over my life and body.
2020: OMG selfish CoViDiOtS wear a fcking mask and social distance because my right to be an anti social shut in and being told what to do is more an important than your freedom 🤬</p></p>

        <p>That's the type of person society has been breeding for decades. It's what you get with all these babying rules. For a long time we've been making such overbearing unnecessary rules without looking at the secondary and tertiary effects. It's literally basic Darwinism. Remove too much danger from people's lives and they grow complacent and dependent. Who still takes real responsibility for their own lives? If society fell down tomorrow, who could take care on their own with no support other than their immediate family?</p>

        <p>No, it wasn't a crisis. Regional conflicts and proxy wars were not a threat to the superpowers. The population was shielded for the most part (except those who were drafted, of course).</p>

        <p>Yes, but the whole point was that it could have escalated beyond that at any moment. There was legitimate fear. Plus there were conflicts related to it (Korean War, Vietnam War).</p>

        <p>Why do you think that the label on a bleach bottle says in capitals, do not drink ?Like someone said above society has been breeding idiots for years. I have family that told me not to come around because it said so on tv. Tv has brainwashed people since the 60’s when a tinfoil space module landed on the moon.

        <p>Well not denying any arguments but labels are for safety tho, it's not a simple thing like "oh just in case don't drink that", more of a what happends if someone drinks that. It's usefull eith everything cause things like getting cleankng products in spray directly into eye is pretty easy and they often have instructions just in case sth like that happens. I know it's not the point, just saying it's a very bad example to try to get the point through.</p>

        <p>They have labels like that as a disclaimer. Because some idiot will eat rat poison and sue the company that made it.Fast forward 30 years and people expect everything handed to them. That brings us to the OP argument. People can’t think for themselves and look at us today.</p>

        <p>What's more mind boggling and irritating to be than that is that people should research on what's going on instead of giving into the fearmongering of the media. Do they know the PCR test doesn't diagnose for viruses and a good majority of them are false positives? Also the rate of deaths are at a steady decline and they were falsified to include deaths with covid and not from covid. How we fought so hard for freedom, it was handed back so easily just for a false sense of security AHH</p>

        <p>I find it interesting because it's mostly left leaning people I've noticed who have been freaking out since day 1.</p>
<p>What makes no sense to me is that all of my liberal friends are anti government, anti establishment, etc, but they will happily comply with whatever their state government mandates in regards to this virus. They constantly post pro mask things, insult everyone who doesn't want to wear masks, and shames anyone who doesn't comply.</p>
<p>I don't understand it.</p>
<p>I also find it crazy that even if you <em>are</em> left leaning and disagree with the lockdowns, you're automatically labeled as right wing, a conspiracy theorist, and a science denier.</p>

<p>It's even more infuriating that these Chicken Littles ran around screaming about bad orange man's impending dictatorship, how the Klan was going to hold daily parades through DC and the White House lawn was going to be Nuremberg c.1933, but then OPENLY BEG FOR A NEW NORMAL DICTATORSHIP!</p>

        <p>I’m a left leaning liberal who’s actually against all of this.  </p>
<p>I find it funny that the most extreme leftists are all against MEGA corporations and yet those are the ones being left as all the local shops are closing due to the lockdowns.  Me personally buy my shit where ever it’s the most convenient. Even if it’s at the “evil Corporation”</p>

        <p>Same, I shop at Walmart because it's close and cheap. But that doesn't mean I'm okay with all these small businesses closing down. The fact that so many of my friends are anti corp but fail to realize the big businesses are profiting the most from these lockdowns kinda blows me away. And they just shrug their shoulders when small business shut down because to them, it's worth it if people aren't dying from this illness.</p>

        <p>Bingo.   I’m the same way. I still support local when I can but people forget local places don’t offer everything  and you can’t go through life with the “I’ll go with out” attitude.   If you really want it you’ll get it anyway you can. besides those who say that online are the ones shopping at Walmart at   10pm because it’s late and they absolutely need milk or eggs for the morning </p>
<p>Also they claim not to use Amazon despite them using it and not even knowing it as many websites use Amazon web services.</p>

        <p>I meam yeah looking at statistics it might seem k if they're lower, but dying directly of something preventable just because I refuse to wear a piece of cloth for 10h. And even if it doesn't work, well at least I'll remember it as at least I tried.</p>
<p>Edit: Don't remember seeing 2nd part sry for not adding for it. </p>
<p>Curently I know 7 people who were infected. 3 of them died only 1 matched your description. If you want to use data use the correct one because as we know since march, young people and die too just not as often. Don't use gossips as facts ffs because that's been going for too long. A friend a family member or coworker said something which they could've heard the same way and now it's offical.</p>

<p>I hope you won't go inside a car, airplane, or out on the street ever again if you never want to risk a chance of death. Ever.</p>
<p>Actually, don't stay inside your house either, you might die there too!</p>

        <p>My very comfortable privleged situation is just living in a small apartment working normal job. Well I guess there was privlege of finding work during pandemic, but why do yall people love asuming things? You know why we avoid that? Cause there are few things actually really bad about this virus, we have no fking idea what it is and how to treat it rn, while people go on and don't feel symptoms it just makes it worse as they spread it without any suspicions, dying from it is a painfull death and what I started seeing more and more recently, people with attitude of this sub.</p>
<p>oH no I CaN'T gO PaRty TogNigHt.</p>
<p>People die from it.</p>
<p>Want to act like nothing is happening? Sure do it. You and people like you will just make numbers go up or if you don't like using that as a term cause this sub just ignores it, people get sick with COVID a lot more when nobody cares about it. </p>
<p>I'm just tired of this 'Faking numbers' or 'Masks are annoying' or 'It's not that deadly anyway', and sad thing is that I know that I won't change a thing in anyones thinking. Good thing I live in NY at least here people took it seriously after march (tho there are more who stoo taking it seriously and that's worrying).</p>

        <p>&rt;My very comfortable privleged situation is just living in a small apartment working normal job.</p>
<p>And you're infinitely better off than most who either can't work because they're furloughed or laid off because the government decided to stop the economy</p>
<p>&rt; but why do yall people love asuming things</p>
<p>Because only the absolutely priveldged that have the luxury of staying home, order grubhub and binge netflix and veg out can be in this pro-lockdown.</p>
<p>&rt;Cause there are few things actually really bad about this virus, we have no fking idea what it is and how to treat it rn</p>
<p>Actually, we do though, thanks to the scientific method. We know this is a virus that has similar symptoms of the flu that is more aggressive to those that are elderly and obese. We learned the legality of the virus has decreased due to the nature of its hosts not surviving long enough to spread. We also learned through various medical trials that the best way to lessen the severity of covid is through vitamin-D suppliments (and sunlight, which we neglected people to get thanks to lockdown.) </p>
<p>Meanwhile, as cases rises (or, it's just flu season, which, happens every year) yet deaths aren't. </p>
<p>Funny enough, Sweden was one of the few countries that did not implement oppressive lockdown measurements, and it's right now one of the few countries in Europe that IS NOT dealing with a 'resurgence' </p>
<p>https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-09-21/sweden-spared-second-wave-coronavirus-so-far</p>
<p>This alone from simple scientific observation should tell you the lockdowns are a mistake.</p>
<p>This isn't about "masks are uncomfortable." This is about arresting industries that thousands if not millions of people depend on to sustain themselves and their families. This is about people dying from lack of care, lack of support from the lockdowns. It will do more harm to us than the virus ever could. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90552173/60-of-shuttered-businesses-on-yelp-will-never-reopen">According to YELP, over 60% of businesses that closed this year will never reopen.</a> thanks to the lockdowns, we've seen the largest transfer of wealth from small businesses to mega corporations like Amazon and Walmart. I hope you love their "we're in this together commercials." I'm sure you did. </p>
<p>&rt;and sad thing is that I know that I won't change a thing in anyones thinking</p>
<p>And with the evidence presented to you that lockdowns are ineffective and cause more harm than the virus could, would YOU be changing your thinking? Or will you stick to your dogma?</p>

        <p>Okay? I don’t see how this relates to the previous comment on self-awareness. </p>
<p>If you don’t want to die from covid, you are always free to stay at home as much as you want while the rest of us go out and get immunity so you can feel safe to come out sooner. Hence my original point that only one side of this debate is trying to prevent the other side from making their own choices.</p>
