        <p>It seriously bothers me how you could not question this sudden love and care from government. Every country has nothing but a long history of government abuses, bribes, treating plebs like plebs, yet collective suddenly blindly trusts them.
Regardless of where you arrive about whole vaxx debate, how can you discount this?</p>

        <p>Yes, the brainwashing has literally created a worldwide cult. You can tell who every member of that cult is. Anyone who wears a face diaper is part of it. This is why I don't bother to try and help any of them. They are all lost. It is better to put all that energy into myself and all the others who are awake to this evil scam. Believe it when I say that these people are the enemy. They are all going to turn completely on everyone who is awake in the near future.</p>

        <p>Yes, agreed. It's so blatant that I feel like I have to go "meta to the meta" and wonder what this is all really about.</p>
<p>Consider -- just as they're coercing and pushing for mandates... Simultaneously they are letting us know that these vaccines have serious side effects for some people. Death, long term heart problems, etc.</p>
<p>They let that through. It's like they want the dual-message: "You MUST get vaccinated. You SHOULDN'T get vaccinated."</p>
<p>So it reads to me like gaslighting. And while YES, the vaccine push IS a real thing -- people ARE losing their jobs over it...</p>
<p>I don't think it's the prime objective, or else they would go to greater lengths to cover up the side effects. They wouldn't make sure we know about them.</p>
<p>So what's happening underneath?</p>
<p>Everything points toward "the great collapse" of the global debt bubble. Everything else around that is a mixture of distraction and capitalizing on investments right before it finally goes "kaboom."</p>
<p>Wells Fargo "shut down all personal credit lines" today. That is in interesting indicator. Recently the reverse-repo with the Fed hit a new record of just under 1 trillion. That's interesting.</p>
<p>Supply line challenges are so common now that people have accepted it as normal...</p>
<p>We have a total system collapse that could happen at any moment. An infrastructure has been set up to lock people down with authoritarianism when it does... And a whole host of other issues to distract: "UFOs", a "new variant", "mandatory vaccination", infringement on personal freedoms, etc.</p>
<p>Some of those are very real issues, but my point is --- it's likely they are not the actual FOCAL POINT.  They may be a distraction.</p>
<p>Suggestion: Prepare now... <em>Just in case</em>. <strong>Don't buy things that will go to waste --- just things you will use anyway.</strong> Canned food, water, etc. Things that won't go bad if the grid is down for some duration.</p>
<p>At the minimum -- you'll be prepared for a short term power outage. In the long term, you'll be able to weather greater supply line challenges and sudden inflation.</p>
<p>And guns. Guns and ammo. Anyone who hasn't stocked up on those has failed to see the enormity of what we are potentially facing. (Admittedly --- I haven't, and don't even know where to begin. I haven't fired a shotgun or handgun in 30 years.)</p>

        <p>Thanks. I fired guns when I was a kid growing up in Texas so it's not totally foreign to me.</p>
<p>What's the best way to purchase something like those these days?</p>
<p>I assume they need to be fired regularly to be kept in shape. Gun ranges. Cleaning &amp; oiling. It's a whole lifestyle I guess.</p>

        <p>palmettostatearmory.com will sell you a basic Honda-Civic-level AR for a good price. They have frequent sales.</p>
<p>On their website, you select your local gun store, and then they ship it to the store. You pay the store a nominal fee (usually $20-$50) to process your background check, and then you take it home.</p>
<p>You'd be surprised how little maintenance these require. They show up ready to shoot out of the box, and unless you're putting tons of rounds through it, you can pretty much ignore it and it'll still function. You'd have to fire several thousand rounds with no cleaning or maintenance for the thing to start screwing up.</p>
<p>Hope that helps, open to discussing this further if you like.</p>

        <p>Ah, California. I used to live there, so I'm very familiar with how that works.</p>
<p>What changes with CA, is two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have a ten-day waiting period after submitting your background check info before you can take it home.</li>
<li>Your AR has to be CA-compliant. You can either find a rifle that's already compliant, or you order one of these: https://palmettostatearmory.com/s-w-rifle-m-p15-sport-ii-5-56nato-16-10202.html#compliance</li>
</ol>
<p>Ship it to your local FFL (gun store), and then have them slap a compliance kit on it for you. (Here's my favorite: https://resurgentarms.com/basic-ra-compliance-kit/)</p>
<p>They'll install the kit for you (takes 5 minutes), and then they can legally release the gun to you. Most FFL's should be willing to do this for you.</p>
