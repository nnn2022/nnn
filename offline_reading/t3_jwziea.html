    <strong>Felt like sharing some thoughts off my chest</strong>
    <p><p>I already had issues in my personal life but at least I had somewhat normal world to look up to. Nowadays seeing where the world is going I completely lost motivation and don't think its even worth it to eat healthy, not drink, study hard to earn a living...idk its like we're living in a badly written dystopian sequel comedy of the real thing...Maybe I'm black pilled or whatever the term is but honestly do You have any advice on how to stay motivated to live in these dark times for human rights and liberty....<br>
The term ''nEw NoRmAl'' <br>
Im sitting here wondering...why such big statements were made literally few day or weeks after the pandemic started...like wtf...and honestly every time I hear somebody says ''the new normal'' I feel an urge to puke for real. <br>
I'm really afraid of forced vaccinations...I would rather go live in the woods than take this sht inside my body and idk...Also masks ... dude they doesnt work thats a real conspiracy theory now sayin the masks will somehow protect us from this super dangerous and deadly virus...honestly im so tired of all this bs.<br>
Im happy to see many people staying with sober mind and speaking against this tyranny but its frightening how big percentage of the population still believes the propaganda and defends the establishment.<br>
Having to follow some dumb made up rules when I can shop, what I should wear, seeing people freaking out if u stay close to one another in public places...bruh <br>
idk</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, odd how they were already talking about a second shut down when the first shutdown was barely under way lol. It's because they planned it. "New normal"...if this WEREN'T planned it would be "Temporarily abnormal". But they had to start that conditioning early. For this to be permanent, for the lockdown, and then a second lockdown, etc. I'm completely convinced that this is all by design.</p>

        <p>What can I say, OP? Propaganda works. Especially when it's being repeated 24/7 by "apolitical" sources too.</p>
<p>Where are you from? Because if you're American, other states are viable escape options. I would have said the same for Australia and Canada with their provinces a couple of months ago, but now? Maybe not so much.</p>
