        <p>No, covid is definitely real. I know because I had it. I had some reasonably intense muscle aches for a couple of days, then nothing, then I lost my sense of smell for nearly a week. The losing smell and taste was bizarre and I felt off-kilter because I wasn’t congested and I didn’t actually <em>feel</em> sick either. </p>
<p>I’ve had the flu too, and the flu is significantly worse. Last time I had it I was bedridden and delirious for 3 days. I know what the flu feels like and covid does not feel like that at all. It was just weird, really weird, and I know this is as subjective as it gets, but I can’t shake the sense that it felt artificial. As in, every other illness : covid as cane sugar : sweet’n’low. Trying to describe how an illness can <em>feel</em> manufactured is like trying to describe tripping to someone who’s never done it, so I know that’s not going to make sense to you if you haven’t had it, but there you go. In any case, I think this pandemic was supposed to be much worse than it turned out to be.</p>

        <p>Wow exactly how I felt about it, manufactured! Never had a sickness feel so ‘fake’ before...i had a pretty bad fever and was very tired but no nausea at all, which was so weird to me because I always get nausea when I’m sick with the flu. Glad to hear someone else with the same sentiment.</p>

        <p>I watched my roommate and her boyfriend go through it- but ya know what?  It was diagnosed as pneumonia brought on by the virus they had.  Flu causes pneumonia too.  </p>
<p>See, covid is not pneumonia.  It's a flu-like respiratory virus that can lead to pneumonia.  Pneumonia is what devastates people.  It is the cause of nearly 3 million people world-wide every single year and is the number one killer in children under 5 years of age.   It's deadly and it is real.  Pneumonia is no joke!   In fact, a couple years ago, pneumonia killed 800,000 children in one season across the planet.</p>
<p>Now, covid MIGHT lead to pneumonia more often or it could simply be that people are reporting pneumonia more often because of all the hype.  But let's not pretend that pneumonia no longer exists.</p>
<p>I'm not saying covid doesn't exist- SOMETHING happened last year in March.  SOMETHING killed people hard and fast in nursing homes.  I'm very willing to believe that was covid, but things stabilized really quickly and we were all back to normal in May.</p>

        <p>I got the "synthetic" feeling too. In my case it was one day of intense chills, nausea and vomiting followed by a couple of weeks of just feeling slightly off, a very intermittent dry cough and lingering metallic taste in my mouth. It reminded me more of a hangover after drugs feeling than any cold or flu I've ever had.</p>

        <p>You described it perfectly. I had the flu in 2018 when it was bad and I got super sick and it developed into pneumonia.</p>
<p>I got covid back in October and it was a day of chills and feeling sick, then after that I just felt weirdly off for like a week.</p>

        <p>No. The name of the doctor who allegedly made this statement is not cited anywhere in the text. </p>
<p>I did some research and it seems that somebody tried linking the statement to a Dr. Robert Oswald. They did this by sticking his picture next to the quote, so they mislead people into believing he said it rather than stating that he said it. </p>
<p>Dr. Robert Oswald subsequently released a statement confirming that the statement had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>The statement should therefore be taken with a pinch of salt as there is nothing to confirm its authenticity.</p>

        <p>Yeah. It gets batshit towards the end. Blaming China for creating a hoax virus is definitely not the kind of statement a doctor or any kind of expert would make unless they had irrefutable evidence. </p>
<p>The start of the message is somewhat plausible as we know that there have been false positives due to the tests being 100% accurate. However, it would be incredible luck for EVERY sample in a batch of 1500 to have no trace of COVID-19.</p>

        <p>I've been saying this, no lab anywhere in the world has ever isolated, purified and proven a "Sars-Cov2" coronavirus variant to be both infectious and transmittable outside of a lab setting.</p>
<p>The claimed "isolation" is just exosomes (which can be found in damn near every living thing) scrapped off the top of swab samples from PCR tests. That's how a goat and a papaya fruit tested "positive" for "Sars-Cov2" in Tanzania last year.</p>
<p>The quote may not be fully accurate, but freedom of information requests and my own search for isolation (not exosomes mixed in with other influenza from a nose or mouth swab) has turned up nothing.</p>

<p>Under the pretext of the global "pandemic" the following goals are achieved by the largest capital (all of them are aimed at overcoming a massive economic crisis, at the heart of which lies the crisis of overproduction):</p>
<p>- closing down plants, factories and even whole industries (i.e. slowing down the production process in order to let old products gradually dissolve and stop the production of new ones)</p>
<p>- downsizing workforce (because many workers are simply not needed when there is an overproduction of goods)</p>
<p>- killing off small and medium businesses in order to replace them on the market (this always happens during an economic crisis, a small capitalist gets eaten by a big one)</p>
<p>- cutting expenses on healthcare and education (millions of operations have been cancelled, medical staff has been getting laid off; schools and universities are switching to remote learning with plans to replace teachers with video lectures)</p>
<p>- fighting and slowing down the inevitable revolutionary uprise (protests and strikes resulting from downsizing, loss of small and medium businesses, loss of democratic rights etc) by banning social gatherings, putting muzzles on people's faces and demoralizing them</p>
<p>- intensifying economic exploitation (cancelling bonuses and freezing salaries; making people work overtime under the pretext of "difficult times for us all"; not paying wages for several months etc)</p>
<p>- maximizing profits, making billions of dollars out of thin air by forcing millions of people to buy a product they don't need (surgical masks against a respiratory virus, sanitizers, gloves, vaccines etc). The daily profit from masks alone is so gigantic that they are for sure to remain with us forever now, until people collectively abolish them)</p>

        <p>I believe the virus to be real. It was in fact engineered in a Chinese lab. There are credible doctors close to the point of origin that have proven this to be the case. Most media outlets elected to ignore this or outright contradict the evidence. Look for the papers published by Dr. Lie-Meng Yan. Dr. Robert Redfield, Former Director of the CDC(2018-2021), also indicated within the last few weeks that his highly informed and credible opinion is that the virus came from a lab in China.</p>

        <p>They never isolated the virus so they have to use some mRNA therapy. If they had isolated the virus they would create a vaccine the same way they make vaccines for all other viruses.</p>
<p>It would make sense to use the same vaccine approach if vaccinating ALL OF HUMANITY as it has been tested done that way for decades. To do the mRNA approach that is less than 5 years old to inject the world's population would not make sense if you have isolated the virus.</p>

        <p>After reviewing other comments here and doing my own research, I've come to the conclusion that this is fake. I suggest moderators replace the flair with "unverified" to prevent the spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>The CDC published all flu cases so far during the 2020-2021 flu season: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm</a></p>
<p>Only 1,675 people were confirmed to have influenza out of 818,939 tests (0.2%). So not only would these 1,500 supposed positive tests have been the majority of the 1,675 (although these 1,500 were never reported by the CDC), but the percentage is SO low that this would be statistically impossible; 1,500 out of 1,500 (100%) testing positive for influenza is no where NEAR 0.2%.</p>
<p>Also, so far influenza B has been the dominant variant this season, consisting of nearly 2/3 of all influenza cases. So that also proves this claim wrong as they claimed most were influenza A.</p>
<p>The CDC is still researching into why influenza cases are so low. Typically the test positivity for influenza averages around 15% more or less. They have done research in the past that shows masks don't prevent the spread of influenza: <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article</a>. Social distancing and increased disinfection/hand washing may be a contributing factor.</p>

        <p>Test positivity for influenza was only 0.2% this flu season. 99.8% of the people who believed they had influenza did not have it. Typically, the test positivity rate for influenza is 15%, which is almost 100x higher than 0.2%.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 is definitely a real virus and is deadly for old people and immunocompromised people. The problem is the government reaction to it, putting people in a state of poverty and dependence, messaging that divides people, a constant fear driven, uninformative news cycle, and the decision early on in western countries to segregate people based on who’s essential and who’s not. It’s really been a clusterfuck all around. Let’s not push this conspiracy bullshit on this sub and instead focus on the tangible problems that are effecting people.</p>

        <p>Then you tell us why not one lab has isolated a virus that has spread to billions of people world-wide.</p>
<p>Labs have claimed to and then admitted to lying when sent court papers demanding proof.  There's still an unclaimed cash prize for that very proof.  </p>
<p>Look at this <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-607-x/71-607-x2020017-eng.htm">graph.</a></p>
<p>It's a graph of Canada's deaths last year- huge spike during March - May, right?</p>
<ol>
<li>Now change the dates to omit the elderly people- that spike goes away, right? Absolutely normal death counts during those three months from the young people.</li>
<li>Now change the graph to ONLY show the elderly people- The elderly people stop dying excessively in May. They go right back to normal.</li>
<li>Back to the young people- there's an increase AFTER the spike, but that's from lockdowns. Lockdowns caused an increase in suicides (yes, it was a significant increase- look it up!) and untreated medical conditions due to hospitals turning people away who needed screening (which they are STILL doing even in America!)</li>
</ol>
<p>The virus (Covid-19) only hit the elderly and only hit during a 3 month period. Yes, yes, there are exceptions- people got sick outside of the elderly population, but big deal- most of it were the elderly- and over 90% of it was in nursing homes.</p>
<p>The young people were not hit by the virus. If so, they'd have died at the same time the elderly people did. The elderly are not affected by the virus ANY MORE. If they were, the virus would have kept on killing them.</p>
<p>Everything happened in that 3 month period. EVERYTHING. (A bit earlier for China and Italy, but my point still stands). Everything else was a result of the lockdowns.</p>
<p>If young people were at risk of dying, the elderly people would still be dying. If the virus was still around, the elderly people would still be dying. The virus is gone.</p>
<p>The only thing keeping the virus going are the PCR tests which have NEVER been able to diagnose a virus- let alone one that hasn't even been isolated yet. No lab cultures are being done- just a bullshit PCR test that is being run at way too high a cycle count.</p>
<p>PCR tests are bullshit as I've said. If you went back in time to 1990 and performed a series of PCR tests for covid-19, you'd get a lot of positives. Yes, you'd get a lot of positives for covid-19 even before the virus was unleashed.</p>
<p>And they are calling every influenza and common cold case and heart condition and kidney failure a COVID-19 case.</p>
<p>That's how. I can wave my hand over you right now and say in a majestic voice, "You have Covid!" and you'd believe me. THAT is how it's still circulating.</p>

<p>Got a source on that? 
The problem with this post is there is no source linked and you replied with more stuff without a source...</p>

<p>Look at all of her references in the description of her video.  She always cites her sources in each video.</p>
<p>And read the book she wrote with other doctors called "Virus Mania"   You can buy it on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Virus-Mania-Continually-Epidemics-Billion-Dollar/dp/1425114679">https://www.amazon.com/Virus-Mania-Continually-Epidemics-Billion-Dollar/dp/1425114679</a></p>
<p>The book literally has thousands of sources all referenced throughout every chapter and detailed in the back of the book.   Every single fact is backed up with evidence.</p>
<p>But then, if you were one to read sources, you wouldn't be trolling reddit.  You're actually afraid of learning something aren't you?</p>
<p>Hell, my VERY RECENT comment history is FILLED with sources, but you're too afraid of learning something that you won't even click that will you?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Glenduil/comments/">https://www.reddit.com/user/Glenduil/comments/</a></p>
<p>Just another doomer reddit troll trying to use the tired old toll, "Quote your sources!"  That line is old.  Can't you trolls come up with anything newer?  Are you even trying?</p>
