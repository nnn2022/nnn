    <strong>Deadliest insurrection.</strong>
    <p><p>The DEADLY Insurrection !!!</p>
<p>As fate would have it After 8 years of prosperity I moved out of CA in the early morning of January 6, 2021.  On that day I listened to NPR for 4 strait ridiculous hours as the insurrection was happening in real time AND this moment just happened to be due to a preset of a Uhaul truck that I had to pick up in AZ and drive to CA because all uhaul trucks in CA carried a $2000 sur-charge before travel fees due to them all leaving the state and not coming back.  </p>
<p>So 4 Hours on NPR during a DEADLY 
insurrection:</p>
<p>I heard a lot of baiting for:
 “Are people being executed in the lawn?” 
“Are you ok, are you barricaded?”
“Are they brandishing weapons?”
“Is the situation under control?” 
“I know You can’t say where you are but are you out of danger are you ok???”
“EXECUTIONS IN THE LAAAAAWN”</p>
<p>like a trailer for a shit B movie I was deceived by a one line..  I’m like: “holy fuck Front lawn executions is worth a listen.” </p>
<p>CA NPR woman with the raspy droney voice (quite frankly - fuck her name, look It up if you care) was on the verge of a full on panic attack while questioning senators..<br>
Many senators were laughing.. (that’s right.. Laughing).  One guy said they saw a guy with an axe handle and another with a pitch fork but no guns.  One laughed about a guy in bib overalls..  I heard a lot of casual conversations happening in the background between people but no one was in a real panic..  I heard background conversations of people with presumably loved ones telling them they were ok..  most of all I could hear people doing what I can presume to be selfie style Twitter videos as they were talking out loud over one another to themselves about the situation and continuously raising their voices to be louder then the person next to them.  I heard the live testimony of probably 8-12 politicians, (it’s hard to say because they did a lot of repeats in between each live testimonial.)  They were..    All democrats, (not that I’m a trumper but I think that’s important non biased info to mention)  as well As the former police chief of the Capitol police who reiterated several times that this could never have happened “But it did that day” (his words) and that 400 armed and dedicated Capitol police officers were in control of the building and trained daily to prevent an event like this from happening.  After 4 hours of listening to background video boosts, repeat edited testimony’s, and the NPR lady doing her absolute best to get someone to say they were in “actual danger” I eventually switched to music out of pure Boredom.</p>
<p>The situation from my end sounded much more like a chance to boost Twitter videos then an actual insurrection..  and now all I see is “Deadly Insurection”.   </p>
<p>Believe what you want.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah I watched multiple Livestreams from participants while working from home and for over 8 hours absolutely nothing interesting happened except the cops shooting an unarmed woman.</p>
<p>The entire deadly insurrection was a bunch of bros taking selfies and making tiktok dance videos.</p>

        <p>Totally understand your frustration, but an emotional response is exactly what they want from you. The only option is to push on. Just stay aware. The misinformation and brainwashing will only get worse from here, but you will be prepared. You’ve seen the truth.</p>

        <p>The Americans FBI "evil spy agency" had inside men who helped orchestrate the push into the capitol. No one was violent besides that pig cop who kill Ashley.</p>

        <p>Was watching a live stream of the front of the Capitol building from that day during the ‘insurrection’. Appeared as if literally nothing was happening. </p>
<p>Everybody was just standing around on the front steps just as they had been the entire day. Nobody running. Nobody fighting. Literally nothing. </p>
<p>I was paying particular attention because I had also heard that violence had broken out, but the livestream of the front of the Capitol building literally appeared as if nothing at all was even going on. Looked the exact same as it had all day, people milling around with flags doing a lot of nothing.</p>
<p>Looked ordinary enough that I would have thought nothing about walking through the area. Literally nothing. Going. On.</p>

        <p>I live 2 hours down the road from DC and saw a charter bus FULL of people stopped at the gas station near my house while I was going to my job that I'm thankful I still have. My thought was that it was kind of weird to see a charter bus going anywhere during a "literal global pandemic". I continued on to work and didn't think anything of it until I saw a news feed later in the day. Then it dawned on me that I most likely saw a glimpse of history unfolding since they were most likely going to the rally</p>
