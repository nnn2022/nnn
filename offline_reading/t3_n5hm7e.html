    <strong>Who else is here because even your friends or family judge you for thinking this is all bull crap?</strong>
    <p><p>Honestly, I probably wouldn't need to be here if I just had some people in my life that understood me and how I felt. However, whenever I try to bring up how I have been feeling about this I am the one in the wrong. That I get told it's still dangerous to go out for dinner even if you have been vaccinated. That it's still dangerous to go out anywhere indoors without a mask. I get told that the flu is gone because of the masking and distance. How is it a virus that has been around much longer than Covid can all the sudden go away from masks, but a brand new virus is the exception and we can still get cases even with vaccinations and restrictions.</p>
<p>The more annoying part of it all is apparently not only are you supposed to be in fear of Covid after being vaccinated, but even when you already had Covid and you didn't experience horrible symptoms you are still supposed to be fearful of getting it again. Like I thought if you get over something that means you have a good immune system? The variants doesn't make the virus deadly, the variants are just ways for the virus trying to figure out how it can spread more. Not necessary be worse than what it already is in terms of the symptoms getting worse whenever there is a new variant.</p>
<p>Anyway yeah it's pretty frustrating. I try to tell people how I feel about the whole Covid situation and yet I get looked at funny. Or that I try to explain how the restrictions are harmful to mental health, but because I have a living situation that is not as bad as it could be I am just supposed to shut up and be grateful for what I have. That if I feel pain, angry, depressed from this whole thing I am in the wrong because I have a pretty good life aside from the pandemic.  </p>
<p>Which is why I love being here. I know I can be fully open with how I feel about the pandemic here and not get judged or ridiculed for feeling the way I do.</p></p>

        <p>The problem is a major lack of <strong>actual education</strong>. It's so sad that hardly anyone knows how Vitamin D and natural supplements work to strengthen the immune system. All they know is what their TV tells them.</p>

        <p>Me. I love this subreddit. I know a few people that have agreed with me, but they don't express as much disdain for the scamdemic as I do.  I'm on the far end the spectrum where I say  "we'd been better off had we done nothing" regarding the covid response. And I wish we'd done nothing at this point.</p>
<p>I agree many of the new normal protocols make no sense nor does the hysteria surrounding covid, but I gave up trying to make sense of <em>The Science</em> a long time ago. I realized that science was being treated like a brand.  It was then I knew it was never about health safety and that we were in for the long haul. </p>
<p>I've only recently started feeling better, as I stopped drinking because I think I'm finally done mourning the loss of my past life. I'm not happy. I will never accept the new normal as long as I'm alive, but I'm not sad anymore. If my friends and family think I'm crazy, so be it. I will continue to be myself and resist the new normal.</p>

        <p>Right here, OP.</p>
<p>Literally my entire bio family are Branch Covidian cultists. And the experimental gene therapy isn't helping the insanity. If anything, they're doubling or tripling down on the fear and insanity.</p>
<p>Hell, judging from some of the other testimonies here and how terrified their designated "experts" have them, it's not out of the question that they'd just excommunicate me completely.</p>

        <p>I had an on-line dr. appt yesterday. Doc said I was wrong that flu cases have not gone down during covid. Also said Fauci didn't say at first to not wear masks. He doesn't think the pcr testing was unbiased. Condescendingly laughed at my questions. I'll find another doc.</p>
