    <strong>Parenting/kids post</strong>
    <p><p>Hey y’all… maybe this is just a rant and not even NNN related but we all know the main parents subs are cesspools. Anyway I feel in the past there’s been like there’s this stereotype of everyone hating being invited to kids birthday parties but is anyone else like DYING to go to just one? My child is older than toddler age and has literally only been to ONE party like what the heck? And now i want to host a party but apparently the school won’t give out contact info for parents for invitations bc of coronski. They’ve been super relaxed and anti CDC regulations about everything else so this seems just so random and disheartening. How can you make friends with school parents if you never see them? Everyone does pick up and drop off at different times and there’s no PTO so idk how we’re supposed to get to know anyone? I didn’t go to college so I don’t have other similar age friends and I’m a little too young to have a kid anyway. I also work nights in the entertainment industry so meeting other mom friends is just down right impossible. I’m actually quite an introverted and shy person but we’ll do anything for our kids right? So I branch out and socialize for my child’s sake but what the hell? Anyone wanna come to a birthday party at the park? lol</p></p>

        <p>I met other parents when my kiddo was young through an online group called the mommies network or mommies group, something like that. See if there's a group in your area through Facebook or do a Google search. There used to also be some meetup thing I think it was through Yahoo, I don't know if that exists anymore but do a little digging and I'm sure you'll find other moms in your area who are in your same situation.</p>

        <p>Yeah I have been looking for a snarky moms group for my area like what was that one that got shut down a few years ago for NYC.. urban mom or something. I live in a major urban city so I would think there’s one but I don’t have FB and haven’t stumbled across one yet</p>

        <p>Nope, you don't want a "snarky mommy" group right now. They are the ones who fell hard for this covid stuff. </p>
<p>How old is your child? Are you looking to meet up with specific friends from this past year or just meet new friends?</p>

        <p>That’s true :/ about to be 4! We definitely have a accrued a bunch of acquaintances and park friends but idk I don’t wanna be creepy so I never get their numbers to meet up again 🤷🏻‍♀️ and it’s hard to gage how judgey people are when it comes to not being vaxed etc. but yeah going forward I need to make new friends with kids bc I don’t want to be in the same predicament next year. It would just be super convenient if his school friends could come to a party and it’d make him so happy.</p>

        <p>It's not creepy to get their number😁 Believe me, most of the other moms are just as desperate as you to have some adult interaction and someone to distract their children. If they're concerned about you being vaccinated they will for sure bring it up lol.</p>

        <p>True true. Okay well I’m glad you said that bc I have this weird mindset that all other moms already have their group of friends but surely there’s openings 😬  I’ll try to do like a group activity or kids sports or something bc I shouldnt be failing my child like this 🙄🙄🙄 grrrrrr</p>

        <p>You're not failing your child. You've got him in school to meet friends and at the park playing. Sounds like he's doing great. Better than those poor little kids who's parents have had them locked up all year😥</p>
<p>We went to several outdoor birthday parties this year so I'd say people generally seem comfortable with that. Actually we even went to an indoor one. If you send an invite home with the child in the backpack make sure you do it at least a week ahead of time though. I almost missed one bc I don't go thru their backpacks until Friday.</p>

        <p>Not sure how this is done in the states but you could try invite the kids the old fashion way ( like before WhatsApp groups) set a date,make a cute birthday invitation card and hand them to teacher to put into the kids bags. Include you phone number so people can react if they will be present or not..
Not sure if this is any help but it has always worked for me</p>

        <p>Try and see, not sure how old your kid is but if you don't tell him/her before people react there will be no harm done, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!</p>

        <p>Maybe try to fly below the radar of the teachers/ administrators. Hopefully it’s a don’t ask, don’t tell policy. Busy body teachers who like virtue signaling points may rat you out and worst case scenario, they could try to “ban” children getting together outside of school. Sounds crazy, but this whole thing has been crazy. </p>
<p>Could be a good idea to pass out invites discretely, if possible.</p>
<p>I’d be less concerned about parents than teachers/schools/daycares enacting horrible policies to avoid perceived threat/ liability.</p>
