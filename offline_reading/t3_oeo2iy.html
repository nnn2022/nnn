    <strong>This Ivermectin discussion should be pinned as a first reference for new visitors</strong>
    <p><p>At the moment we have Busta Rhymes pinned at the top of the sub, which....fair enough, I appreciate the sentiment but it's not going to change anyone's preexisting views. If you want to have a better impact on first time visitors why not give them something they can really sink their teeth into and which cannot as easily be dismissed?</p>
<p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/covid-ivermectin-crime-century-darkhorse-podcast-pierre/id1471581521?i=1000523859023">This talk</a> (also found <a href="https://odysee.com/@crotacheese75:e/DarkHorse-Podcast-with-Pierre-Kory-And-Bret-Weinstein:b">here</a> in video form) between Bret Weinstein (evolutionary biologist) and Pierre Kory (M.D. specialising in pulmonary disorders) looks at the effectiveness of Ivermectin as a treatment for Covid in a very clear and rational manner and also highlights how its proven benefits have been deliberately blocked from public awareness by people who, in doing so, are putting millions of people at risk.</p>
<p>It is quite long but just the first hour should be enough to make it clear that their opinions on the subject are grounded in a variety of real world trials and that the narrative on Ivermectin (and even Kory himself if you look at the deeply disingenuous edit war on his Wiki page) is being deliberately manipulated to steer people away from alternatives to mRNA therapies.</p>
<p>There is solid evidence that masks <strong>don't</strong> work (and some that they may actually cause harm) but countless people will say, "Wearing one doesn't do any harm so even if there's no proof of benefit why not wear one just to be safe?"</p>
<p>There is solid evidence that Ivermectin provides significant benefits and it has decades of proven safe use, yet instead of the adopting the above "why not try it just to be safer?" approach it is sidelined, suppressed and demonised. The discussion linked above should be enough to awaken a little skepticism about the New Normal in anyone who listens to it and if it fails to do so they are almost certainly a close-minded, lost cause.</p></p>

        <p>There are two links above so I'm not sure what you mean. The first is to the apple podcast (you can also find it by searching for Dark Horse podcast - 1st June episode) and the second is to the video version on <a href="https://odysee.com">odysee.com</a>. The direct link to the latter is <a href="https://odysee.com/@crotacheese75:e/DarkHorse-Podcast-with-Pierre-Kory-And-Bret-Weinstein:b">https://odysee.com/@crotacheese75:e/DarkHorse-Podcast-with-Pierre-Kory-And-Bret-Weinstein:b</a></p>
