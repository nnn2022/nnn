        <p>First of all, vaccines aren’t taking us back to normal.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, the message here rings true on so many levels. How about our relationship with our government? How about those who were killed or psychologically tortured by China et. al.’s actions the past 20 months? We say “no new normal,” but we’re never getting our old normal back. All we can hope for is a BETTER normal.</p>

        <p>I do feel sad for these people. I just wish that last spring, they would have realized all of this. I think most of us anti-lockdowners realized early on that all of this would happen—we would have lost opportunities, missed milestones we will never get back. When the government was telling us to snitch on our neighbors and small businesses, we knew there would be irreparable damage. Many us pointed this out repeatedly but all we got in return was personal attacks &amp; death wishes! People wished we would get covid and then either be denied health care because we chose to be so selfish or be denied a ventilator because there weren’t enough to go around! So while I still feel sad for these people, at the same time I do feel angry over the way myself and everyone else was treated when we brought all of this up!</p>

        <p>Not really, they're still only concerned about their own loss and not the loss others, notice how it's pretty much all people saying "I missed out on a graduation ceremony" or something petty. Like wow you didn't get to party with your friends after school, this is the type of rampant narcissism that caused lockdowns in the first place. </p>
<p>Meanwhile from day 1 we've been talking about the people that are getting evicted because they can't afford rent, arrested for having mask exemptions, having their businesses shutdown and livelihoods stripped from them, watching the greatest transfer of wealth from the lower and middle classes to the 1%, the elderly people suffering alone in nursing homes because they're forced to have no visitors, people being locked in their own homes for 22 hours a day in the name of public health. But all they care about is their graduation ceremony. Puts things in perspective huh.</p>
