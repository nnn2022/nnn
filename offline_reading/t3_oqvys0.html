        <p>They should tell that to Dr. Charles Hoffe’s First Nations patients injured by the Moderna “vaccine”.</p>
<p>Video link: https://hive.blog/hive-110786/@drutter/sjbdolck</p>
<p>&rt;”So <strong>what I’m telling people about is not some theory, this is what I have seen in my own patients. I’ve been a doctor to these patients for 28 years and now three of them are disabled by this first (Moderna) vaccine.</strong> And it upsets me very much because <strong>these people did not know that they were part of an experiment.”</strong>
^(6:30-6:48)</p>
<p>&rt;”But it grieved me that <strong>all of the patients that I have that now, have longterm ongoing neurological side effects, are all First Nations people.</strong> Because they were the people who got it first and the rest of us are just getting it now.”
^(19:45-20:29)</p>
<h2>Dr. Hoffe: microscopic blood clots</h2>
<p>&rt;“The blood clots we hear about which the media claim are very rare are the big blood clots which are the ones that cause strokes and show up on CT scans, MRI, etc. <strong>The clots I’m talking about are microscopic and too small to find on any scan. They can thus only be detected using the D-dimer test.”</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Dr Hoffe explains <strong>he has been performing D-dimer tests on his mRNA ‘vaccinated’ patients and he has worryingly identified that 62 percent of them had these microscopic blood clots.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;“These people have no idea they are even having these <strong>microscopic blood clots</strong>. The most alarming part of this is that there are <strong>some parts of the body like the brain, spinal cord, heart and lungs which cannot re-generate.</strong> When those tissues are damaged by blood clots they are permanently damaged.”</p>
<p>https://principia-scientific.com/doctor-heart-failure-from-mrna-jabs-will-kill-most-people/</p>
<h2>Dr. Hoffe explains his research findings to other doctors</h2>
<p>&rt;“The concern is now that these vessels are permanently damaged in a person’s lungs. When the heart tries to pump blood through all those damaged vessels, there’s increased resistance trying to pump the blood through those lungs. <strong>So those people are going to develop something called pulmonary artery hypertension, high blood pressure in their lungs, and the concern with that is that those people will probably all develop right-sided heart failure within three years and die.</strong>
Because they now have increased vascular resistance through their lungs and lung tissue and heart tissue and brain and spinal tissue, and all of that does not regenerate. In other tissues it can regenerate, liver and kidneys and muscle, but there’s some tissues that cannot, and <strong>so this absolutely explains what I’ve seen in my patients and that’s what I’m doing to prove it in my studies ongoing.”</strong>
