        <p>This is why I believe it wasn’t a fully planned pandemic. It randomly happened and it wasn’t until tPTB saw how much it panicked everyone that they realized they could seize the opportunity.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it was planned because a lot of politicians sold stock at the beginning because they thought the market would crash. So either they weren’t in on it or they weren’t expecting it. I believe it was that it was surprising to them too.</p>
<p>The issue is that it got politicized. Trump and Co said to close the borders and avoid crowds and the resist gang were against it. At first against all precautions and masks because its “racist” towards the Chinese, and then did a 180 once trump said “oh wait it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>I doubt it was planned but it certainly was being used for political control the moment it began.</p>

        <p>True that... I think this was going to go whichever way was the opposite of the tack that Trump took. If he had said absolutely nothing one way or the other, I think CoVid-19 would have quickly disappeared from the MSM.</p>
