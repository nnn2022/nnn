        <p>Yeah I believe that would definitely be the case. everyone on my road has been meeting once every 2 or 3 weeks when we got something to talk about. I believe everyone should really do that bc anything could happen even a tornado or a fire to get out of hand and just get each other's backs.</p>

        <p>First.  Draft dodgers would be <em>first in line</em> to get the COVID vaccine.  If the left accuses you of something, it’s because it’s what they would do/are doing.</p>

        <p>Well, how to unravel it...just look at any of it closely.</p>
<p>First:</p>
<p>\&rt;Covid 19 is the enemy and has killed more Americans than WW2, The war in Vietnam and the Korean wars combined. COMBINED.</p>
<p>Based on 95% of the victims having 4 comorbidities on average. We weren't sending the terminally ill to war, we were sending young healthy people. These folks are dying and will die covid or no.</p>
<p>The average age of the covid victims is often older than the places life expectancy and they want to compare this to teenagers? Are they sick in the head?</p>
<p>If you assume a dead soldier lost 45 years of life expectancy, and the average covid victim loses almost none, how is this a fair comparison?</p>
<p>If you asked a thousand families if they'd rather sacrifice their 19 year old or the oldest and frailest member of the family, I don't expect many would go with the 19 year old.</p>
<p>Even with the stupid method of counting used for covid deaths, we still see the vast majority in a certain group: old, overweight, unhealthy, autoimmune problems.</p>
<p>That's like saying, we only need 100,000 armed soldiers, so everyone else in the country is going to get training to be an unarmed civilian. They didn't dodge the soldier training, they dodged the unarmed civilian training.</p>

        <p>What's wrong with draft dodgers?</p>
<p>The Vietnam War was a senseless waste of millions of lives on both sides.  Americans pillaged and terrorized a nation and a people for over a decade.  The American boys who served were being used as fodder in some elaborate geopolitical game.</p>
<p>The military industrial complex made billions off the blood of millions of innocent American and Vietnamese, and they did so using deception to the American public, based off a broken ideology known as the Domino Effect.  This deception and unnecessary bloodshed lasted for over a decade.</p>
<p>Draft dodgers had the foresight and courage to stand up for what they believe.  It wasn't easy, but they were proven courageous heroes in the end.  One famous draft dodger named Jack Todd ended up in Canada, where he now writes a successful sports column.</p>
<p>If you weren't a draft dodger, unfortunately you were being used by the military industrial complex, by the billionaire elite and political bureaucrats, as a lamb to the slaughter.</p>
<p>This is how it has turned out historically.</p>
<p>So, I guess we are draft dodgers.</p>
