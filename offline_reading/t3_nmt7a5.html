    <strong>Is Covid the latest replacement of Christianity in the Western world? Is the vaccine the Communion bread for the cult/religion of Covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I was thinking about this today. As a lot of people point out, Covid is like a cult. Cults require rituals. Christianity has many rituals, the Communion bread being one of them.</p>
<p>Christianity is dying. Christianity was/is dying because of competition. But as some smart people point out, religions are always replaced by something similar, meaning, they're always replaced with something that has the same level of detail, rituals, etc, that adapts perfectly to culture. So Christianity couldn't possible be replaced by science. Why? Because science (real science, anyways) is way too complex and requires far too much skepticism to ever unite people in a ritualistic way.</p>
<p><strong>So Christianity is replaced by sporadical wokeness.</strong> BLM, Climate Change, etc. Each with its own churches and rituals (just like Protestantism, Catholocism, etc..). These quasi-religions are perfect, they are simple, they're adapted to the modern world, they drink from some science here and there, etc.. Covid is the latest and greatest iteration of such wokeness.</p>
<p>Covid replaced a floppy Christianity in the Western world. We all know Covid is not a thing in the Muslim world. Why? Because their religion is even more dogmatic than Covid, so it takes precedence.</p>
<p>This leads me to the point of this. The vaccine is the Communion bread. Everyone has to take it. It's for your own sins, it's for everybody's sins, just take it.</p>
<p>Take it and you shall be free.</p></p>

        <p>There are definitely strong religious undertones in the way these people think. </p>
<p>The whole “diseased until proven otherwise” mentality is basically original sin.</p>

<p>Exactly! And the vaccine is an easy solution for purifying your soul, just like the communion bread. That's why I think this vaccine could potentially be here to stay.</p>

        <p>Yup, just like Christianity, it’s all about “salvation”. It’s actually a very interesting parallel lol.</p>

        <p>Agree that the Covid fanatics see it as a religion, and that those who claim there is no God usually end up worshipping something else (like the govt) , but honestly it seems you don't understand Catholicism very well.</p>
<p>It is not incompatible with science at all. Science is the understanding of the material world. Catholisism is about both the material and immaterial world that science cannot measure. It believes in the natural law and supports science. That's why Catholics produced a lot of scientific breakthroughs and its schools and hospitals are often among the best. Catholic beliefs and science not mutually exclusive.</p>
<p>Communion is a sacrament, not a ritual. Its nor just to give people something to do.</p>
