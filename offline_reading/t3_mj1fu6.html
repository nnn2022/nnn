    <strong>How do you think this will end?</strong>
    <p><p>Of course I should add... "if it ever does" because I have arrived at a point where I don't think this ever will. I don't think a lot of this will ever go away just like elements of 9/11 never did as far as restrictions and security that was supposed to be temporary at the time.</p>
<p>There are times when I think, okay this is going to end we will go back to some relative sort of normal. But then I think even if we do, it's not going to last. This was a drill for something else that's coming. This past year has blackpilled me intensely. My trust in faith and humanity is shattered. Not that I had a heck of a lot of it to begin with but it's pretty non-existent at this point. I've become extremely questioning and suspicious of nearly everything. I almost feel as if I have PTSD, only we are not at the P part yet. But my whole way of thinking has radically changed. I was a person who thought people that questioned things to the degree that I am now were over the top and crazy. Well it's not so crazy now. </p>
<p>I have had a lot of trauma in my life and I know what it feels like physically and emotionally and it's exactly how I feel right now. This entire situation feels intensely abusive and like the biggest mind-fuck I've ever experienced in my life.</p>
<p>I am in New York and the vaccine passport took effect today. It makes me sick, like physically ill just thinking about it. I have had to start taking longer breaks from the internet because it is affecting me in a very negative way.</p>
<p>I really enjoy everyone's posts here and I was just wondering, what do you guys think? How do you think this will pan out?</p></p>

        <p>I think it either ends like 9/11 (restrictions stay) or serious civil unrest with the government being forced to relax the restrictions.</p>

<p>I think people are done with it. Its only a matter of time before the doomers wake up and then the elite are fucked. They got cocky and are beginning to expose themselves to the general public.</p>

        <p>I've had conversations with a few people about this and the one thing we keep wondering is, why aren't people flipping out more than they are? Every once in awhile you hear of someone losing it and trying to attack a public official or something but it's nowhere near like what you would think it would be considering this has been going on for so long. And then there's the matter of there being more guns than people in the US. And the fact that guns and ammo are selling out right now and hard to get. It makes me wonder what we are building up to. I recently saw footage of a crowd Uprising in India as well as Romania. There were so many people in the streets protesting against this. Haven't seen any of that in the US at all. The occasional protests but nothing substantial. It feels like something is building and it's about to go off like a pressure cooker exploding.</p>

<p>America population is waaaay spread out when compared to everywhere else. We had a big one last year and about 5% of our population turned out which is only a few thousand people. 5% of population in other places could be hundreds of thousands.</p>

        <p>Remember that that vaccine passport shit is still kind of a laughable joke.  I know it must be super bothersome being in New York because it's actually being rolled out, but it's not like it's widescale yet, right?  There's also huge push back in other States so the idea of it becoming a national thing is still far off.  Must be hard to be in New York in general with this whole situation.  Like holy fuck - I'm sure you've seen those outside inside restaurants.  Literally fully enclosed structures 'outside' of restaurants.  How stupid can people be.  </p>
<p>The weather is going to keep getting warmer.  This is a seasonal illness.  Vaccines are being rolled out.  Unless they are going to turn up the deception full blast there should be some breathing room as the summer comes up.</p>

        <p>The Outdoor inside restaurants are ridiculous, I walked past plenty of them in the depths of January when we had some close to Sub-Zero days and people were actually sitting outside fully bundled up in coats eating their meals and it looked truly insane. It was at that time that I wondered if we are just completely different species or something. I do hope things get better this summer, I feel like if it does it won't last though.

        <p>At this point I'd rather just have the dirty bastards come out and tell us either the restrictions are here to stay forever and that this is the new world order or that shit erupts into complete chaos and anarchy so I can brandish my sweet new guns in the fiery hellscape.

        <p>Yup we’ve got quite the incoming selection headed our way. The John Hopkins Foundation blatantly states the future SPARS pandemic of 2025-2028. What kinda genies are they employing for such astounding clairvoyance? The WEF are hosting their cyber pandemic exercise in July this year after “warning” us of the mysterious and totally unrelated possibility this will happen in the near future last August. In fact look no further than Billy G, Google’s listed “most powerful doctor in the world”, issuing “warnings” midway through last year saying “the next one’s the big one, that’ll make them notice next time” (<em>grating chuckle followed by flailing arms</em>). It all makes me sick to my stomach.</p>

        <p>What I see are three large pillars that they have been working on, to support the new worldly government with unseen masters. Besides teaching people to be obedient and listen only to their sources, which we all pay for, either trough taxation of in most cases, inflation.  </p>
<p>1) A new digital, central bank owned currency.</p>
<p>2) vaccine passports and the social credit score that comes with it.</p>
<p>3) The endless opportunities to slightly tweak the epigenome, and perhaps even the genome, of the vaccinated. We will be forced a few vaccinations every year and they will be cranked out more efficiently and less transparently. Maybe one might accidentaly make us infertile, a few years after injection.</p>

        <p>A third world war so bloody that the US government will reinstate a conscription/draft. This time, all able-bodied people of any gender will be forced into combat or logistics/production for the war effort. A lot of the world will die and the global trade, communications, and energy infrastructure will be totally crippled. Those who actually live through the war will likely be new citizens of an extreme global dictatorship. It will be dark times.</p>

        <p>&rt; I have had a lot of trauma in my life</p>
<p>The establishment is literally using narcissistic abuse patterns to shape people's behavior:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cause pain without warning -- initial fear and lockdowns.</li>
<li>Say the pain will go away when your behavior improves.</li>
<li>When you finally object and rebel, take a half-step back -- partial reopening.</li>
</ol>
<p>The initial behavior has now been locked-in; you've conceded that ground to your abuser. They will repeat this two-steps-forward, one-step-back cycle again.</p>
<p>I spotted all of this in real-time, but only because I know what abuse and sociopathy looks like. So, in a way, I'm grateful for my past abuse.</p>

        <p>I have seriously wondered if this will happen somewhere. It won't happen in the US but they sense the tension as they have turned our capitol into a military zone with fences and soldiers and we have never had that before.</p>

        <p>I think it all “resolves” with a whimper.  Many of the changes since 19 will become commonplace, but people, having the short attention span they have, will just grow to accept it. </p>
<p>Yep.  Most people are going to roll over and put up with it.  Those of us who can’t deal, withdraw from society, largely.  I’m too small of a force to make real change that effects many.</p>
