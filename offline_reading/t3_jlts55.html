    <strong>Who had a great Halloween?</strong>
    <p><p>Mine was great! Fifty kids, and only one family wearing PPE masks. We bought an assortment of candy, and put them in Halloween bags, the big candy, surrounded by  chocolates and little candies, because I wasn't sure how many prudes were going to stiff the kids on This One Night They are Allowed to Breathe.</p>
<p>No crack heads, no meth mouths, no selfish parents; it was great. This is the first time I've seen all the parents dress up, too. There was some cat in a giant teddy bear suit with his kids.</p>
<p>It was like.... back in the sixties, when my sister and I would go for miles with pillowcases.</p></p>

        <p>I was having a decent Halloween... right up until the announcement that my country is locking down again. That killed my mood for the rest of the night.</p>

        <p>Not gonna lie, it was pretty depressing where I am. Not one kid out on the streets, just completely desolate. Halloween is usually one of my favourite nights of the year for the atmosphere but this year it just made me sad.</p>

<p>I absolutely heard that loud and clear tonight. It was normal and no one was weird and everyone huddled close to get candy. I am not afraid of this virus and treated handing out candy like any other year. Itâ€™s been wonderful!</p>

        <p>We have garage bars. Two on our block, I guess to give each other a break. It's BYOB. There was a party at one of 'em, scary kid movies and a fire pit, etc.. Looked like a great time, but it was my anniversary, so we did a fancy dinner, instead.</p>

        <p>So my Halloween tradition is pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Before our kids, our next door neighbors, my wife and I would sit outside and give out candy.  My wife would go to bed and my neighbors and I would have a drink post-trick or treating.</p>
<p>Tonight, after more trick or treaters than last year and putting my kids to bed, we hung out and had our drink as normal.  They're big microbrew enthusiasts and have a garage fridge full of local stuff.  Well, the husband neighbor had a few too many and saw a corner neighbor we wave at but haven't met in 5 years living here coming home.  He ran across the street and insisted that the neighbor have a beer.</p>
<p>Well, I met a cool guy. He's a contractor, no kids, married, and he <em>shook my hand</em>.  We just chewed the fat until a bit ago when it was time for my neighbor to go to bed (he had a <em>great</em> night, but had a few too many).  We said our goodbyes and went back to our houses.</p>
<p>In 2020 of all years, we set a record for trick or treaters and I met a neighbor I've waved at for years but never met.</p>
<p>Halloween was a win.</p>

        <p>Took the kids trick or treating in the neighborhood, almost half the houses had candy out, we only knocked on one door where they had a chute.  We didn't wear masks and most the other trick or treaters we saw didn't wear masks.  Overall better than I expected.</p>

        <p>I saw one woman and her two kids with masks, looked at the baggies of candy and said, "thank you for being hygienic." No- I just wanted to hand out a bunch of candy this year to make up for squabs like her keeping them out of school and sports and playgrounds.</p>
<p>Oh, there were two more masks- Darth Vader and Kylo Ren, but they had their masks on the top of their heads.</p>

        <p>When I first moved into my neighborhood in 2005, we had the most beautiful Halloweens, then the economy went down, and people started renting out houses to whoever had a suitcase, and the place became a little meth/crack cartel. We had zombies throughout the year, and the kids were afraid of going out on Oct. 31. My old next door neighbor used to deal heroin out of her kitchen window like a McD's drive through.</p>
<p>Now it's back to being a great place, I don't want to lose it. I don't think politicians realize that their decisions can wreck a community.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that things were rough before but glad it's better now! I live in a neighborhood with lots of older people so we have the reputation that people are asleep during the time of trick or treat... It's gotten better now as new families have moved in but not much in terms of foot traffic</p>

        <p>Better than expected! No older kids (which saddens me - I dressed In elaborate costumes  and trick or treated all through high school), but lots of 4-6 year olds and all the parents were dressed up. People were camping out outside, some with a little fire pit, with candy at the end of the driveway. Iâ€™m on the west coast and thought it would be much much worse.</p>

        <p>Mine was great, although there was a severe lack of homes passing out candy. There were some homes using a chute of sorts, which I thought was creative. Thankfully, there was a church giving out candy, got 3 large Hershey bars. Also my friend sat on me.</p>

        <p>It was okay. I went for a really long walk to exercise. No costumes or trick-or-treaters, but it was decent until I noticed plenty of masked zombies out. Even kids/young people! </p>
<p>It was just eerie and fucking depressing. I especially hate those black muzzles, I always feel like I'm about to get robbed/murdered when I see those.</p>

<p>I work in a tavern. Weâ€™re not at pre-C levels but we are doing very, very well compared to. </p>
<p>Tonight was off the hook. Everyone was in costume. No masks except for Halloween themed.</p>
<p>Tonight was slammed. </p>
<p>A couple of days ago one of our competitors hosted a trick or trunk night. </p>
<p>At least 75 kids and parents in costume.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s getting better here. Almost no one is worried about this pandemic in this area. </p>
<p>Stay strong everyone. You know the truth and truth is freedom.</p>
