    <strong>There's no better a time for one to do their own research then when they are faced with a world screaming for them not to do it.</strong>
    <p><p>The inventor of MRna tech says be cautious. </p>
<p>Nobel prize winning virologist says vaccines cause the variants.</p>
<p>Nobel prize winner Kary Mullis inventor of the PCR test warned its an easily manipulated tool not to be used for diagnosis because of how easy it is to create false positives.</p>
<p>Ivermectin is on the WHO's list of essential medicines - It and the person who discovered it received the nobel prize - These vaccines were given eua - on the contingency that no other treatment is available - including repurposed drugs. Ivermectin is out of patent and cant make them money. If there is prophylactics or treatment no EUA. Period. </p>
<p>Dr.  byram bridle of  guelph university - A career vaccinologist - warned about dangers associated with MRNA vaxes and what can happen with antibody dependant  enhancement along with studies that show the vax migrates from the injection site and can collect in the testicals and overies.  </p>
<p>Pierre Kory - treated thousands of patients with ivermectin and helped develop the standard of care for treating covid used in many hospitals. </p>
<p>Dr. Peter McCullough - the most published doctor in the space of heart and kidney function - in the history of the world - who is a covid survivor warns against the lack of treatment options and the focus on vaccines. </p>
<p>There are plenty of doctors / scientists with credentials who are experts in their fields trying to speak out - there is an undeniable campaign to censor information and opinions that counter the narrative. This alone makes me very cautious. </p>
<p>How many nobel prize winning scientists or volcanologists are on the "Right side of history"  ? </p>
<p>When a claim is made its dismissed or censored. Even if its made by experts - who - if we were not facing a pandemic/ censorship campaign  - would be respected for their opinions in relation to their area of learned expertise. </p>
<p>You miss a lot when you've been conditioned to think a specific way. We're all privy to the same information pool. I have experienced the same 18 months as everyone. My opinions on whats right or wrong are just as valid as anyone else's. </p>
<p>Why? Because we are in no way being told the truth about any of this. </p>
<p>Something ain't right.</p></p>

        <p>Because that requires actual effort outside the MSM propoganda that is readily available everywhere.</p>
<p>If someone just has blind faith in the system, how would they research it? Well Google, or Youtube, or Social Media. Censorship gives them the agenda first.</p>
<p>You really think a common person would look up what test is used, who invented it, what company they worked for, who funded the studies... etc</p>
<p>And then do the same thing for every facet of this social experiment?</p>
<p>Nah. And that is part of the problem.</p>
<p><em>remember "informed consent" is "vaccine hesitancy" and needs to be censored...</em></p>
