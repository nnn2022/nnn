    <strong>What ever happened to "follow the science"?</strong>
    <p><p>We've heard this mantra of following the "science", repeated ad nauseam, mostly by those with no understanding of the scientific method, doing precisely the opposite, often from supposed academics. Contrary to what lockdown lunatics like to suggest, there has NOT been any "consensus" in the scientific community with regards to the dangers of covid or the efficacy of the measures undertaken in the name of fighting it. We've had a litany of dubious "experts" spreading propaganda and misinformation while thousands of actual experts have been shamelessly smeared and censored. I can't take anyone seriously who is still oblivious to or in denial about this.</p>
<p>Now. Here is a list of easy to grab and share studies on hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and vitamin D. There are many, many, MANY other sources on each one of these, the body of work is really rather voluminous and overwhelmingly positive in favor of these things being completely safe and very effective to treat covid.</p>
<p>HCQ: https://c19study.com/</p>
<p>Ivermectin: https://c19ivermectin.com/</p>
<p>Vitamin D: https://c19vitamind.com/</p>
<p>None of this is even new (although new studies do continue to come out almost on a daily basis, continuing to add to the strength of evidence), nor is it really in dispute by anyone, even, it's all quite well established. Go ahead and review the studies for yourselves.</p>
<p>So WTF are we doing? Don't even start about "cases" fueled by fraudulent PCR testing, as the notion of asymptomatic spread has already been thoroughly discredited. Even if this was everything that was feared, which it unequivocally has been shown not to be, there are safe effective treatments.</p>
<p>I'm honestly exhausted. I have not complied since day 1, I have no intention of ever complying, but this doesn't change the fact that most people ARE, and they are dragging the rest of the world into hell along with them. All because, why, exactly? Facing the fact that not everyone in positions of power have our best interests at heart is too uncomfortable? I'm sick and tired of hearing people dismiss everything as "conspiracy", even when completely unprompted. The official story does not stand up to even the slightest amount of scrutiny, public officials have done nothing but lie and contradict themselves since the start, and characters like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and the rest have literally been telling us exactly what they are doing (Schwab wrote a damn book about it FFS). Dismissing their agendas that are widely, openly and publicly discussed, as conspiracy theories is asinine.</p>
<p>While I hate them myself, I honestly don't care about your personal feelings about masks, fuck it. Wear one if you feel good about it. I never have, I never will, I will not be coerced. I don't care about your political persuasion either. All these "measures" have literally caused incalculable harm to the poorest, most vulnerable and most disadvantaged people on earth and destroyed small businesses during an unprecedented transfer of wealth to billionaires, so don't fucking tell me we are all in this together, this is all to stay safe and save grandma. You need to be truly, profoundly ignorant to actually believe that in spite of the reality before you.</p>
<p>Say NO to the new ABNORMAL.</p></p>

        <p>That's actually my new response to dimwits who tell me to "listen to the science." I ask them to explain the scientific method to me. When they can't answer me they default to their next cope of "listen to the experts" in which I reference experts who go against their opinion and throw it right back in their face "why don't YOU listen to the experts." The conversation usually goes nowhere from there because 99% of people are too cowardly to admit how wrong they are.</p>

        <p>Because none of them are doing research, and think that "following the science" means following the rules.</p>

        <p>You do know that means “follow what they tell you”. It’s never based on science. If you want good answers ask people in Singapore or S Korea on airborne viruses. Not one person in america gets it.</p>
