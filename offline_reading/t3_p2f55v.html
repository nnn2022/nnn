        <p>First of all, if you don't care about education status, then you have to ignore the results of this study. Because they used education status to make this claim.</p>
<p>Second, I'm assuming you read the headline, and didn't read the link and download the actual study papers, so I'll walk you through it with a few points.</p>
<p>Lines 264, 265 and 266 state that "vaccine hesitancy" included the people who told the researchers they would wait first to see if the vaccine was safe, and take it later. This is very different from those who would <em>refuse</em> the vaccine. The statistics on educated people who would flat-out <em>refuse</em> the vaccine in the highly educated was only 1.2% out of a sample of over 10k in this category, as per table 1. So just over 120 people who claimed to have a PHD out of over 10k would refuse it.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my next point. Lines 276-279 describe how the analysists "assumed" that the cards were filled out in good faith. That's statistician talk for "literally nothing we asked was verified whatsoever". It goes on to state that many people used the "gender" bracket to make political and transphobic comments. Great study!</p>
<p>Based on the figures given, the unemployed and native Americans were most likely to refuse the vaccine. Please be careful with articles like this.</p>
