    <strong>We need to start protesting like the civil rights activists</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, so I'm sure many of you are aware of <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/14/nyc-woman-booted-from-royal-caribbean-cruise-after-testing-positive-for-covid/">this story</a>. Apparently this cruise company is segregating passengers based on their vaccination status, and not allowing the unvaccinated to access the "better" parts of the cruise ship. </p>
<p>And I want to propose something. Hear me out. </p>
<p>From February to July of 1960, a series of nonviolent protests known as the Greensboro sit-ins were staged, as a protest against segregation of black and white people. In these sit-ins, black men and women would enter white-only lunch counters, and request to be served. When they were denied service, they would sit down and refuse to leave. They did this every day until the lunch counters  in question were desegregated.</p>
<p>What I'm proposing is that we do the same thing with vaccine passports, and businesses that deny service based on vaccination status. If they are going to take us back to the 1960s and treat people unequally over something as arbitrary as whether or not they took an experimental drug, then we should also bring back the protests of the 1960s to counter such discrimination. Remain peaceful and completely non -violent, but at the same time don't submit to those who wish to disenfranchise us. And be persistent about it, too.</p>
<p>We should not be sitting ducks living in helpless fear of an incoming authoritarian regime. The next time someone denies you service over a mask or a vaccine, don't just complain about it on Reddit. Put your foot down, get together with like-minded friends, and practice a little civil disobedience. I don't think that we should just lie down and die and give up all hope, because we may still be able to stave off authoritarianism with this kind of political action.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely, this should happen, and the vaccinated should burn their cards in solidarity.</p>

        <p>I agree with your views that peaceful protests should be held, it is ridiculous to see the lengths propaganda will go to make vaccine passports relevant. I am vaccinated and while I’m hoping I don’t have to regret my choice I will accept the consequences if there are any. </p>
<p>I also expect others to do the same for their actions and it seems to me that most people avoiding the jab are willing to accept the risks it poses to them. Which ironically seems to be almost nothing. </p>
<p>Either way vaccine passports are unethical and deserve to be treated as a serious threat to human rights in the direction they are heading now. Stepping back it’s easy to see how this is a gateway to some really horrible scenarios.</p>
