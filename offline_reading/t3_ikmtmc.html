    <strong>A Question Regarding Privacy</strong>
    <p><p>So one of the eras where I think discourse surrounding more of the concern with government over-reach, mandated vaccines, surveillance is the phone analog. </p>
<p>"Why are you worried about being microchipped, facial recognition or both when you use a smart phone which you carry everywhere with you that can do the same thing?" </p>
<p>Is a common retort heard when expressing concern about the "new normal" and the loss privacy it may entail. For the record, I don't know if there is strong evidence to support the idea that a vaccine would contain a microchip, but the tech does in fact exist and the idea has been floated... so let's not pretend it's coming out of left field. Is there a name for the retort listed above? </p>
<p>Like I get that we should be less comfortable with the amount of data already being harvested from us through our devices... but I can still leave my phone home with me, or toss it in the trash if I wanted. A chip implanted in my skin not so much. </p>
<p>Why should we accept less privacy then we do today because we accept less today than we had before?</p>
<p>Anyway, just a musing.</p></p>

        <p>This one's easy- I can always choose to leave my smartphone at home, or not have a smartphone at all. </p>
<p>When people say this it just shows how addicted to technology the world has become. Yes, it is a great tool in many cases, but it is not nearly as necessary as many make it seem- especially for day-to-day (do I really need my smartphone as a timer for cooking? No, but it's convenient). And this is coming from someone whose job is entirely dependent on tech/ internet. And again, I can turn my computer off and store it at the end of the day; it doesn't follow my every move.</p>

        <p>You don't have to trash your smartphone or leave it home. I have one without a sim. So I use all the functionality except the phone number by connecting to wifi-hotspots. But there is no personal information attached to it via the phone number. In order to track the phone, they will have to provide some sort of free wifi everywhere and you could still switch it off wifi anytime you like.</p>

        <p>If it's an android phone, Google is still tracking your location data, search history, emails, browser history, etc. and updating their databases whenever you connect to wifi. If it's an iPhone, Google is still tracking all of that info if you use their Gmail/Maps/Chrome apps. Even if you aren't using their apps, Apple is tracking the same info with their Mail/Safari/Maps apps.</p>

        <p>They can track a device when you connect over wifi, they can't possibly have your personal data. Because you don't enter the data in your phone in some way. But when you have a sim installed they see the phone number registered and because you have your name bind to the phone number they know now about you. Without the sim they can't tell who is who. Otherwise I can try and connect to a random gmail account from my no-sim smartphone and make google think I am some other guy. So they can't rely on that kind of info. And there is always vpn, proxies, etc if you want to go extreme.</p>

        <p>Using all of that data I just listed out, they can very easily connect your IRL identity to your google account using metadata analysis. The logging of all your data is happening even when you're not connected to the internet, and the servers are updated whenever you connect to wifi. They can even use the built in accelerometer to perform <a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2019/6471532/">gait analysis</a> and determine if you're the person who normally carries that phone.</p>
<p>There is no way to maintain privacy in the world of big data as long as you're carrying around a smartphone. You've made things a bit harder by cutting the phone company out of the equation, but Google has more information about you than the phone company could ever dream of having.</p>

        <p>I am not sure I get your point. I buy on ebay a 2nd hand phoneI switch it on. What information do they have other than the phone is connected to a wifi? What other information can they possibly have?</p>
<p>Android is open source. That means you do whatever you like. Here is a list of some android forks</p>
<p><a href="https://www.geckoandfly.com/23320/custom-rom-firmware-android-smartphones/">https://www.geckoandfly.com/23320/custom-rom-firmware-android-smartphones/</a></p>
<p>So you modify the kernel anyway you like. And playstore is not the only application to get apps. You can use fdroid or other repositories. different browsers etc. There is even a sub here</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fdroid/">https://www.reddit.com/r/fdroid/</a> </p>
<p>If you ever connect to your real accounts use a secure vpn at the top. The analysis google will see, when you connect over vpn it will be that of the vpn. The only problem is you need a relatively good spec phone to use these custom android O/Ses.</p>
<p>They still have the MAC address from the phone's network hardware which can identify the phone each time you connect to wifi and so they can tell it's the same phone that was connected. But even that you can change it.</p>

        <p>&rt; I buy on ebay a 2nd hand phoneI switch it on. What information do they have other than the phone is connected to a wifi? What other information can they possibly have?</p>
<p>Well, you have to log in or create a google account just to start using the phone, so right off the bat they can combine that info with the GPS to determine that the device is now being used by a new person.</p>
<p>&rt;If you ever connect to your real accounts use a secure vpn at the top.</p>
<p>That only prevents them from seeing your IP address. They don't need your IP address. Your phone is collecting data itself and uploading it directly to their servers, <em>through</em> the VPN tunnel.</p>
<p>&rt;They still have the MAC address from the phone's network hardware which can identify the phone each time you connect to wifi and so they can tell it's the same phone that was connected. But even that you can change it.</p>
<p>You're too focused on the physical device. They don't need to know specifically what device you're using. The whole idea behind Big Data is that they can create a shadow profile for your identity based on metadata. That shadow profile becomes more and more accurate as it gathers more data. It contains your home and work coordinates based on GPS location logging combined with your travel patterns. It contains facial recognition data on you and your social contacts based on the photos you all take. It contains data on your speech/writing characteristics based on the way you type emails/texts and the words you most frequently use/misspell/etc. Eventually, it gets accurate enough that they can quickly identify who you are even if you just switched to a brand new device.</p>
<p>Even if you don't own a smartphone at all, they can use metadata from the smartphones of your friends a family to continue updating your shadow profile. I attended a seminar back in 2015 on big data investigative analytics. During this seminar they demonstrated how they used cluster analysis of nothing but public facebook posts to generate an org chart of the Occupy Wall Street leadership at Zuccotti Park in 2011. This org chart included names and photos of several people who didn't even have a facebook profile. That was 5 years ago and I'm sure they're 100x more advanced in their analysis by now.</p>

        <p>The reason I am focused on the phone's hardware is because other than that, everything else can be changed because android is open source. The only problem is the hardware. How can they collect anything if the operating system won't collect anything? And why I need to create a google account at all to begin with? The whole idea of open source is to modify the kernel anyway you like. You can't do that with iOS but you can with android.</p>
<p>And VPN can protect you from metadata retention. And from there is TOR network. And email you could use e2e encryption like protonmail.</p>
<p>I understand that social networks can expose people even without accounts or even phone, but for real time tracking is not easy to track you from the smartphone. In fact depending on the knowledge level, you could send fake metadata theoretically. Perhaps these are things will evolve soon given these privacy violations.</p>
<p>I would be more concerned with cameras installed to tell you the truth. I am talking about covid testing and tracking and medical certs mostly. You got to be more mobile that you used to.</p>
<p>The part I want to avoid is if they track people by covid outbreaks and proximity because obviously they would want to lock you up and brand you as a disease spreader.</p>

        <p>Whatever the formal name for it it's really just laziness and an abandonment of the individual will to circumstance, and by default to people with evil designs upon us all. You have a choice whether or not to do the things you mention with a smartphone, and it remains under the control of the user. Tyranny affords you neither of those privileges; it takes from you whether you want it to or not.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is not going to be chipped. How would they read it? Trust me, even if they wanted to, that's not how they'd do it. You ever had a chipped pet? The chip is much larger than anything that could fit in a vaccine: about the size of a grain of rice. And even then they have to wand over the animal to read it.</p>
<p>But as regards the tech privacy issue, this is my wheelhouse. I left Google in 2013. I'd been off Facebook for several years before that. I got rid of my smart phone last year. It was 3G and it was not going to work anymore. I got a flip phone where I pay by the minute. I use so little text and calls that I am paying the minimum: $10 every 4 months. And I get to keep the account balance that I rack up. It runs on the Verizon network, too, so it works very well. Page Plus if you are interested.</p>
<p>You can replace you smartphone with real physical things that the phone itself replaced. I don't know about you but I still had, for example, my old Garmin GPS. Might need a new battery but those are cheap. I bought an iPod mini-like noname music player. Five dollar pedometer at Walmart. Need a list or a coupon or something? Print it out. I got some other useful items from my parents who had no need for them. I already had a digital camera but since my dad has gone iPhone, he offered me his. Only the latest smartphones have comparable cameras and even then they lack the optics.</p>
<p>I pay for my email through a service called FastMail. No privacy worries there. It can be done, and it is worth it imo. It takes time, patience and some planning.</p>
