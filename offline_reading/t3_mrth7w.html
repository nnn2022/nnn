        <p>This is from Reuters... (https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-vaers-deaths-idUSL1N2MZ2H8)  </p>
<p>&rt;There is no evidence that the deaths reported to VAERS after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are caused by the vaccine. Healthcare providers are required to report any death after vaccination to VAERS.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I think the question here knowing that providers have to report a death after a vaccine is required, what are the results of the examinations and autopsys that would confirm the cause of death.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>From the CDC website...(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html)  </p>
<p>&rt;A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy, and medical records has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am just trying to get to factual data points...partially because I just had a pediatrician tell me today that no one has died from the vaccine.  She is either lying/misinformed or no clinical information has been submitted yet to support a vaccine in fact killed a patient.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I came here today to get to some data.  Hopefully this thread can turn into some relevant factual data with reliable sources.</p>
