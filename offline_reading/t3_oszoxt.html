    <strong>Respiratory Therapist here again and I'm freaked out</strong>
    <p><p>I'm about to lose my livelyhood if I don't take this fucking jab. Shit is getting very real. People, even the vaccinated need to stand up. I can't believe more people aren't disturbed by all this. I could maybe understand if the fatality rate was 20...30...40%, but fuck me, we're talking 98-99% survival and that's among those that get it. The absolute risk...Jesus Fucking Christ. It's similar to the risk of dying in a car wreck. They could end world hunger for over 500 years with the money they've spent on covid and the lives saved would be in the billions. But fuck...they care about us. Fucking criminal orginizations spewing mysterious jabs for a mysterious virus that came from a fucking mysterious lab. What? Nothing to see here. Fuck. It is quite literally straight from a dystopian movie...BUT IT'S REAL. Lord help our children</p></p>
