    <strong>Stay strong.</strong>
    <p><p>I know there’s a lot of crap going on in today’s age, the sheep that ignore the fact that if you get the “vaccine” you can still catch and spread covid, if other people wear masks and you don’t, you’re the sick one? Even if you’re not sick. I’ve seen someone say “but adverse effects from the vaccine is really low” well so is dying from Covid, the most at risk population makes sense, they’re old, obese, immune compromised but then shouldnt we apply that same attitude towards smoking?  If there’s a chance people can die from the effects of smoking shouldn’t it be proactively stopped? Nah, they make too much money on that. </p>
<p>I was telling my partner that with everything going on today is Holocaust 2.0 and the people who are “looking out for us” are like Hitler 2.0. In 50 years or some time in the future we will be reading about what’s happening today as a Holocaust like event, and those that haven’t fallen for the crap will be deemed saviours or heroes. </p>
<p>Don’t let them win, stay strong. I don’t know what the future holds but my gut is telling me we will be happy for not following the narrative. </p>
<p>Also the attitude of the sheep is sickening. Don’t want to take an experimental vaccine that the companies hold no liability for? Anti vaxxer - they’ve forgotten that an anti vaxxer has had no vaccines their whole life. Anti masker? Standing up for a human right is wrong? </p>
<p>And I don’t mean human right as if it’s been said from a court or authority, it’s your body, your choice.</p></p>
