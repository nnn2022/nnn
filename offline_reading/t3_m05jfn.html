    <strong>I just don’t get it</strong>
    <p><p>This pandemic is simple: it’s a pandemic. Covid kills people. I know that; it killed my grandmother. I don’t understand why you guys think there’s something beyond “there’s a deadly virus out there and we need to stay safe.” It’s not like all the countries got together and said, “Hey, you know what would be really fun? If we got people to bow down to us by releasing a deadly, economy-destroying, world-changing virus.” So yeah. I would like to hear your guys thoughts.</p></p>

        <p>I think most people here will automatically react at posts that even so slightly paints this community as being a certain way because it's so so common to hear patronizing comments and people tend to jump to conclusions. </p>
<p>Ok Ill tell you my point of view then. I don't trust China, WHO, UN, some of these billionaires turned vaccine funders, the companies themselves and our local governments when it comes to handling this situation with integrity and without conflicts of interests and corruption. I'm very much aware the virus is here, I just don't think the way it's handled is beneficial to society. In fact I belive it's downright ludicrous, dangerous and the effects of this mismanagement will be felt for years to come even if it stops this second.</p>

        <p>You'll never guess what killed my Grandmas. The point is that .... people die from things, there have been many, many pandemics in the past. That you ignored. And you may have participated in by killing other peoples grannys that you didnt care about at the time. And you didnt want to stop the world for them.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>Straight away, I can give you the simplest reason: I've had covid. As I'm a Millennial without extra risk factors, it was very mild, more so than a cold. I'm also disabled. And yet, tomorrow I'm going to have to stand in the freezing cold with my spine killing me for probably at least twenty minutes outside my local vet since they won't let people in to sit down, and when I get back, if I can find the energy, I may have to deal with the fact GP appointments are almost exclusively by telephone and I really need to be seen in person now. This isn't helping avoid spreading covid, and it's making my health a lot worse. The measures aren't logical for the stated purpose. Our UK government is hostile to our socialised health service, it's a very simple ulterior motive for why they've been harshly limiting it.</p>

        <p>Ok, then I'm jumping to conclusions. My bad, it's quite common for people to cite their own situation as a reason why this needs to go on. </p>
<p>Yes, most people who have a sense of basic proportions will tell you covid is dangerous for elderly of frail and sick people. So how is it logical to stop the whole world about it? Why not use, for example, targeted protection? And why not put in on referendum instead of listening to ccp funded WHO? 
And why are we suddenly trying to save every life? People die, I'm sorry that's a fact of life. And I tell you this as someone who's best friend left this world at 36 not so long ago. It sucks, I'm sorry, I feel you. But you gotta move on, you'll never get the time back. You can't stop the world until life is riskless.</p>

        <p>Just one thing to think about:  The economy was heading for a collapse <em>anyways</em>. People have been talking about this for a while. The stock market. Automation/robots. Etc.  </p>
<p>Would it maybe be attractive to "force it", kind of "shake the leaves off the tree" and blame it on "an act of God"? Do all the things that people might have resisted, in "normal times". Push the country through the change in a "controlled" manner, instead of all chaotic and stuttering. Maybe even "fix" some other problems along the way, while you have the unique "opportunity"?</p>
<p>That way the government doesnt have to take responsibility for it. Ok .. maybe at some point it comes out that it was an "over-reaction" and it was "too much". But how can anyone be held responsible? They can just say "Well it was better to be safe than sorry!"</p>

        <p>I want to add this: you think you can "wait out life" like this is a pause button. If you have any other people still living, they can be gone like that (snap) from anything. So many times I didnt know I was spending the last Christmas/Birthday with someone. The things you arent doing now with people are not things you are postphoning, they are things not happening that may never happen.</p>

<p>Yes the virus is real but it’s not as deadly as they claim it is.  Plus people die all the time.  It’s a part of life, especially for old people.  I lost my grandmother a decade ago.   She was 67 and had diabetes and other health problems. Not once did I prance around demanding the world to shut down or change their habits </p>
<p>Also unless you were by your grandmothers side when she died how do you know she did from covid? Maybe the hospital doing shady work.</p>

        <p>OP, I am sorry for your loss of your grandmother, I really am. However, your tragedy does not dictate or is a license on how it is affects the lives of others.</p>
<p>&rt;It’s not like all the countries got together and said, “Hey, you know  what would be really fun? If we got people to bow down to us by  releasing a deadly, economy-destroying, world-changing virus.”  </p>
<p>This is where you are wrong. The World Economic Forum says you are wrong! Read it in their own words of what they want to do with "The Great Reset[1]." These are the guys, the 1%, that say life as you know it will change. It is not a coincidence, in my home State of New York, that they are rolling out the COVID-19 "passport[2]." And believe me, they are not doing it for your safety or health. I highly recommend you look up Klaus Schwab[3], and hear it from the horses mouth rather then me typing these words up and decide for yourself.</p>
