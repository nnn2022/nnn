    <strong>What is the effect that the current covid-19 crisis and lockdowns are proven to have on our device usage and addiction to it?</strong>
    <p><p>Our <a href="https://globalowls.com/social-media-addiction/">Social Media and Smartphone Addiction</a> have been growing rapidly. The long-lasting Lockdown has made it even more difficult for us to go outside and leave our devices alone. </p>
<p>One would expect the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The covid-19 crisis in itself is stressful for many people across the world;</li>
<li>Covid-19 and subsequent lockdowns cause people to work <em>and</em> leisure from home at unprecedented levels, which leads to more technology usage;</li>
<li>The stress from covid-19 is multiplied by the stresses of information overload and other negative effects of digital technology.</li>
</ol>
<p>Turns out, this simple math works out and <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/blogs/tech-impact/statistics-about-smartphone-usage-and-the-effect-of-covid-19">research indicates that this is exactly what is happening</a>. In other words: the dangers of social media addiction are more and more becoming the dangers of tech overuse — <em>to each and every one of us</em>. </p>
<p>Now, how dangerous is that exactly?</p>
<p>Here are a few of the many available studies documenting the negative effects of technology dependency on our mental health:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anxiety and Confusion</strong><br>
A study from <a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/surviving-a-day-without-smartphones/">MIT</a> found that students who were asked to give up their phones for just 24 hours suffered from anxiety and confusion without their mobiles.</li>
<li><strong>Withdrawal symptoms</strong><br>
A study from the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcc4.12109">Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication</a> that found that some young people suffered from withdrawal symptoms (like increased blood pressure and heart rate) when separated from their phones.</li>
<li><strong>Increase of suicide rates in young people</strong><br>
A <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702617723376">study</a> that linked the increase of suicide rates in young people to an increase in the use of social media and mobile phones. The correlation was evident, although causation was not shown in this study. In the article, a fair case is made to accept the possibility of causation (more use of social media -&rt; higher suicide rates) at face level, however.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Brain Chemistry: Differences in brain structure, neurotransmitters and brain function*</strong><br>
If you prefer something a little more concrete, a study presented at the <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-11/rson-sac111717.php">Radiological Society of North America conference</a> found differences in brain structure and brain function (including different levels of chemicals in the brain) in teens who were thought to be addicted to smartphones (and corresponding “normalization” of brain structure and function after these teens went through treatment).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sharing just to alarm people, but please be conscious about your behavior and don't let the Tech Giants dictate your behavior. Also, here are a couple of <a href="https://globalowls.com/social-media-addiction/#social-media-addiction-solutions">possible solutions to social media addiction</a>.</p></p>

        <p>Thanks for this.</p>
<p>I deleted Facebook in 2012 and went back for one year between 2017 and 2018. I decided it wasn't for me. I only had an empty Instagram account to check musicians and some news.</p>
<p>However, I developed an unhealthy obsession with Twitter. At first it was only to check the news (number of cases, etc.), but I now check it for rumors and other people's opinions.</p>
<p>As we all know Twitter is the worst (most toxic) media platform. I am trying to quit it.</p>

        <p>Wow. Seems like you're well ahead on a journey of being self-conscious. I tip my hat. Hope you will be able to share your learnings with those that need them most. All kinds of addictions are bad. It fills your mind with what you don't want and takes away from what you do want. All the best!</p>

        <p>I have never used Twitter, don't use Instagram, snap chat, and quit FB about a year or two ago and no one has missed me, I haven't missed them. I now only use FB marketplace to buy and sell on rare occasions. My family is weird and doesn't communicate so I basically stick to my fiance. I personally startrd using reddit, and watching Youtube WAY more, but that's because I'm pregnant and sick not 'caz of covid. I have been watching With Out A Crystal Ball drama unfold on there, along with Life After Lockup and Real Housewives when they get uploaded. Never watched so much screen time before.</p>

        <p>They are periods in life when you need more rest and relaxation. Watching movies can help. The trick is to be conscious about it and see when you don't need it anymore and can get energy from being more active instead of behind a screen. All the best!</p>
