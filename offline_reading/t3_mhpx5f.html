    <strong>Sick to my stomach</strong>
    <p><p>This pandemic and everything about it has destroyed all of society and will continue to do so. I’m not going to Easter this Sunday, not because of the virus but because some in my family are so divided about it I cannot stand them. No, I am not a far right nazi because I don’t want the vax. I’m not a bigot because I don’t believe in passports. Within the past few days, I’ve heard the exact line “you would be mad if you lived in the era when they made drivers licenses a thing too I bet” and “when you talk about the good ol days you’re referring to when they used to beat up gays and blacks, right?” (No, I’m referring to when nickelback was on the radio and our biggest problem was the war in Iraq)</p>
<p>I’m not even a vaccine denier, just a skeptic. I don’t want to put an experimental vaccine into my bloodstream. I’m not a bad person because I question the vaccine or the motives behind various political agendas. </p>
<p>I’m merely a skeptic...I have been one since I was a kid. It’s a part of who i am...I’m not “a white guy trying to feel oppressed” or victimize myself as some family members try to tell me.  I don’t want to live in a world where I have to explain to my children that none of this is right at all, this is not how it’s supposed to be, mass confusion and hysteria. My mental health has taken a fucking dive these past couple weeks...we’re all in this together I guess.</p></p>

        <p>Right there with ya dude. I made a post because I feel like I'm losing it too. I sent an article about the CDC director saying the vaccine means you can't transmit the virus to my doomer family. </p>
<p>You think they would be over the moon right? Nope. Most of them got angry at me and my own mother said "Well I don't know if we can trust that or know that is true" so we all have to just keep doing whatever they say "just to be safe" </p>
<p>Remember when our parents used to tell us "if all your friends jumped off a cliff would you go to?" </p>
<p>Well apparently the answer is yes because this entire last year has been an exercise in lemmings throwing themselves off the cliff under government orders.</p>

        <p>I'm with you too. I don't have a family walked away from abusive one. I am sure they are all lining up for the vaxx and I would be shut down too, if I was still around being scapegoated. They believe in the system and hated me for questioning things. My mental health has taken a dive too. Feel for you as well.</p>

        <p>My personal solution is getting my shit together and starting my own family. We’re living in an age where doing that is highly discouraged and considered politically incorrect. I could give a rats ass about that at this point. I could go on a tangent about the same family members telling me “oh you just want to be the man with a servant wife who you’re in control of”</p>
<p>No, not at all. I’m not some meme ultra Christian redpiller. I just want to do my own thing. Please, just leave me the fuck alone and let me live my own life without condescending judgement.</p>

        <p>Yeah I know they are denying young people families and jobs that pay decent wages for their own lives and so they can support families. Our society does not work at all for regular people. I was not able to have children so there can be some pain in that down the pike. Aunties and uncles who are childless in many American families, are shunted aside. Family isn't even the same anymore. It's weird your family does not want you to marry or have a family, I mean they did? Are they narcissists or scapegoaters trying to sabotage your future? You may need to go read over at raisedbynarcissists.  Cut off anyone who is trying to ruin your life, or drill a hole in your boat. Relative or not, they aren't worth it. It sounds like you just want to have a good life, and they want to bring you down.</p>

<p>They ALWAYS bring up this one. Any time you mention anything remotely pro-conservative or traditional, this will get brought up as the "gotcha" for why the new "woke" is the ONLY acceptable moral framework.</p>

        <p>It’s a rant I’ve heard time and time again. I have been basically shunned and gas lighted from my brother for years. </p>
<p>The good news is, every time he comes around with these rants, I got 10 people to back me up and tell me he’s a complete nut job. One of my best friends is saying that people like him are no longer human at this point, they’re void of human traits and emotions and are simply followers of the agenda and their only purpose on this earth is to serve it. I just wish the rest of my family wouldn’t take such a neutral stance because I know deep down they know it’s wrong...I literally feel like I am being psychologically tortured. When I block him on everything, he emails me. And calls me a bigot, the biggest one he knows. And he does not want the biggest bigot he knows to be his brother.  Meanwhile he has literally told me he’s cheering on the collapse of society for the greater good.</p>

        <p>Take care of yourself, do what you need to do, but I lost my grandma two years ago and I was a shithead teenager who didn't appreciate her when she was around until her last few years (not saying you are, just setting the scene). </p>
<p>Point is I wish I could go back more than I ever thought I would just to listen to her tell the same story for the ten thousandth time. It might be worth it to go and just hang out with her. </p>
<p>If you really don't want to go then make sure it is your choice and not because some of your family are acting like assholes, because then they are not only ruining your mental health but taking away what could be your last few years with your grandmother, and her last few years with you.</p>
