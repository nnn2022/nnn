    <strong>What can people like me do when the people who oppose Covid restrictions are corrupt, violent and even worse than the others?</strong>
    <p><p>In my country, there is one party that opposes Covid restrictions, a far right one named AUR. OK, fair enough, we've all seen these words thrown away to anyone. But they are not just that. All its members are either criminals or members from different gangs who also never worked a single day in their life, or idiots who can't even spell their name correctly. And not to mention, all of them get extremely agresive whenever anyone dissagrees with them, they can't have a normal conversation (just like the "woke" unit).</p>
<p>The people who went to protests, most of them are gypsies who demanded the opening of casinos and betting houses. Nothing about schools, small businesses, gyms, etc. Plus, it is a well known fact that the gambling industry here is controlled by mafia (another stain on the protests). Oh, and not to mention they destroyed public property, bus stations, cars and even some small stores and stole from them. And the public figures are pretty much all corrupt ex politicians, corrupt journalists and controversial influencers (all have their bad reputation from long before Covid, they are known as being garbage people).</p>
<p>So here is my question, what can someone like me do, I fully see and understand that this whole madness that lasts for over a year is completely idiotic. Also, those people just oppose the restrictions, they don't come with any arguments like everyone of you do, they just oppose them because they do, thus cancelling their opinions automatically by the media. We don't have a DeSantis or Abbott. The only politician who actually did something respectful is a mayor of one big city who in a press conference told the police from it's city not to fine anyone not wearing a mask and to give them one instead. Yeah, he is also pro mask, but he said he respects everyone's opinion and choice and that nobody should be punished for having a different thinking. But that's pretty much it.</p></p>

        <p>I looked up AUR and it seems like an ok party to me, except that they are supposedly "magyarophobic". You're scared of opposing covid restrictions cause you think you will be associated with them?</p>

        <p>Yeah I went to the March 29 protest myself and marched around Bucharest but as you mentioned it was full of those kinds of people and the next day my boss accused me that I have associated myself with dangerous people. The following week I had to see memes and social media ramblings making fun of protesters and calling them stupid and uneducated &amp; of course people were shocked when I told them I attended (I am neither of a different ethnic origin nor am I uneducated or part of AUR).</p>
<p>Honestly the people that oppose restrictions in Romania are not all corrupt, violent, aggressive or interlopi. Indeed this group of people prevailed and of course they showed them on TV the most because they want to discredit people who are against restrictions and paint us in a very bad light in a strategic manner to discourage other highly educated, intelligent Romanians to think for themselves and join the protests. But I can assure you I've been there with a gang of intelligent and educated young Romanians who are just tired of their youth going to waste in an uncertain climate with shitty leaders that we wasted our votes on for the past few years.</p>
<p>Check out the community "Starea de Libertate". They might have members in common with AUR, but as far as I've seen they declare themselves as apolitical and they have been a leading member of last week's protests before AUR chimed in.</p>

        <p>lol but the others are right if your media simply labels you then you need to form your own group even if its small. You will pretty much have to run your own PR campaign on social media or just old school handing out leaflets and putting up posters in areas that will get you lots of eyes. It will be slow growing but its better than just rolling over and accepting your situation.</p>
