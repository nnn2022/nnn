    <strong>The irony of people ditching my baby shower for covid</strong>
    <p><p>So I’m having a baby shower on the weekend. Two friends have said they would come but then got some new covid news from the television or whatever and decided they weren’t going to come. I’ve been cutting off friends like this during this nonsense so they got cut. 
I realized the irony is people aren’t even down to celebrate new life coming into the world because they’re stuck masturbating over the fear of death from covid. Honestly , I don’t need losers like this in my life. Harsh? Maybe. But I feel like it says something so essential about the person and our relationship.</p></p>

        <p>We are ruled by a global death cult and they've finally gotten all the peasants to join their sick club. Sorry for your loss. I've also had to cut off former friends due to gaslighting and stubborn ignorance. It's a shame but it's better amd healthier than being mocked and bullied into accepting and bowing to the fear campaign.</p>

        <p>I would honestly rather be friend-less than be friends with people who wait on our governor to tell them what to do and have to yammer about how they’re too scared to do anything right now. My mom is worried and thinks it’s not worth it for me to lose friends just so I can stand my ground. But I don’t want to be friends with anyone who can’t handle a difference of opinion either.</p>

        <p>I totally agree. It’s deeper than just a light disagreement. It represents a lot. How people are acting now is how they act in general magnified. My one friend was already paranoid and obsessed with themselves , is now watching CNN constantly and sanitizing every two minutes. My other friend already ditched me for guys and cancelled plans often , now is missing the baby shower for my first child. What is the point of having friends like these ?</p>

        <p>Toronto. 
One just said they were too scared of crowds right now so they’d have to decline (even though we’re following the stupid 10 person only rule) and the other said her boyfriend of like three months had been exposed to it at work and she “really didn’t want to get me sick” ( friend of 10 years ). Pretty sure she just didn’t want to drive from Kitchener to Toronto.</p>

<p>It's going to be bad for people with kids even if we somehow get over this nonsense. I feel societal decay is accelerating, and that's not the world you want your kids to grow up in.</p>
<p>I'm in Vancouver. I want to escape to a rural region if this is over. Like a town with population under a thousand. Cities get people nuts. I would suggest something like that for you.</p>

        <p>Yea I’ve been thinking about that and my husband and I are planning for it. 
Also I feel like people are subconsciously getting on board with this whole mindset of there being overpopulation and humans being plague rats... so people are kind of less excited about people having kids. Depopulation agenda success lol</p>

        <p>Good for you, I wish you luck.</p>
<p>No need to worry about overpopulation. Overpopulation itself solves the problem. Look at Korea and Japan where birth rates have declined below death rates. In Japan where it has been happening for a while, an entire apartment block only has about 4-5 families, and they have an elderly town, where the whole section of town is made up of people 60 or older.</p>
<p>People who do projections are the worst. They think very linearly. They think it'll continue on as it did, but we are living in a very dynamic world. Those that predicted human-like intelligence out of computers by 2050 have failed, population estimates have failed, and covid mortality estimates failed too.</p>
<p>You can do linear extrapolations in some limited things, but to bet the whole world over that is crazy.</p>

        <p>Nah, they’re jealous.  They see you with a husband and baby and it makes them feel bad about themselves.  The virus nonsense is just a convenient excuse.  They are not your friends.  I had to cut a friend off for boasting about the club she’s in for people with no kids, and how they think they’re superior to us.  She was an idiot at my wedding and ditched it early.  I haven’t missed her a bit.</p>

        <p>Harsh?  Yes.</p>
<p>I get being disappointed in people turning down your shower.  I get being disappointed in friends. (if I had a quarter, right?)  If you have so many friends that you can just cut a few out for this reason, I envy you. </p>
<p>But fear for health, regardless of how misplaced, is real.  You probably have many other things in common.  They won't be at your shower.  Their loss.  You won't be calling them for a while.  Their loss.  You may think less of them.  You should.  But there is no need to end a friendship.</p>

        <p>I have several friendships that are pretty much on life support if not dead already due to all this. I normally would not be quick to drop people, but these last few months have shown me how little some people actually care about others. They're so wrapped up in fear and paranoia they're willing to forgo seeing others in person for the foreseeable future, and at this point I take it personally. I'm not willing to accept a friendship where they put in absolutely no effort besides some kind of virtual interaction and expect me to cater to their every irrational fear.</p>

        <p>Yea , I was on the verge of being convinced I was “just being selfish” and not caring about their health and rational fears, but something deep within me just knows it is deeper than that. 
Also the fact that my friend of ten years is foregoing the baby shower to be quarantined at home with some guy she’s known for three months who is already living with her and her kids... not sure how much it’s really about ~safety~ lol.</p>

If I felt confident we could just leave politics out if it I would reach out, but with many people it's becoming impossible to do that these days.</p>

        <p>&rt; I'm not willing to accept a friendship where they put in absolutely no effort besides some kind of virtual interaction and expect me to cater to their every irrational fear.</p>
<p>Absolutely not.  But I may have missed something.  I don't see failure to attend an event as anything close to catering to irrational fear.  They decide not to attend for what to them are good reasons.  You aren't catering to anything unless you feel you have some right demand attendance.</p>

        <p>A baby shower is a special event that may not happen again for a woman, or a few times at most. I don't have kids, but I would be really offended if someone chose not to celebrate that with me over what amounts to catching a cold.</p>
<p>On another topic, I've noticed that people seem to be using the "I don't want to get anyone sick, teehee!" line to get out of obligations they didn't want to go to in the first place.</p>

<p>Yeah.  Guilty of that one myself.  Not that I'm really afraid, but it is a nice guilt-free excuse.</p>

        <p>The truth is you don't know if they are lying or not and why ending a friendship over something like that is stupid. it's selfish to end a friendship because they don't want to get someone sick at the baby shower. that's perfectly reasonable and yeah you can't prove if they are lying, that's why you shouldn't act irrationally.</p>

        <p>Based on the rest of the thread, it sounds like she limited the size of the event to accommodate them, they promised to come, and then they decided they were too scared anyway and bailed. I'd be annoyed too. While "cut off" is a harsh term I would probably stop putting in any effort to see or please them. Which likely comes to the same thing</p>

        <p>Fair.  I don't make special accommodations usually for people.  Aside from occasional vegan dishes served, which I will still grumble about.  But if I did and someone backed out, I would be pissed.</p>
<p>Matter of fact that did happen.  Large dinner party (in the beforetimes) one Vegan attending.  I made one dish and altered two recipes to accomodate.   She cancelled.  And yes, I <em>was</em> pissed.</p>

        <p>That has absolutely no bearing on what I said. Show me where what I said takes any stance other than acting rationally, just because you don't like it doesn't mean I'm for or against a new normal, all it shows is your own inability to have a discussion where someone GASP doesn't agree with what you did.</p>

        <p>It seems you consider being able to fuck and get presents a great achivement. Trust me, it's not. On a more serious note, i suggest you show some understanding if what you consider friends have other priorities than you these days. If not showing up to a babyshower during a pandemic transforms your friends to losers, they were probably notyour  friends in the first place. Being friends demands mutual respect, and you show none.</p>
