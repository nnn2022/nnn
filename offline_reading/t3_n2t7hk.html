    <strong>A philosophical piece of writing I did for school</strong>
    <p><p>I'm currently in a short story writing class for college, and we were assigned to write a word loop piece that had every sentence start with the word that the previous sentence ended with. I felt like the instructions lent itself to this topic fairly well.</p>
<p><em>Am I wiser now than I was before? Before I knew how this wretched world worked I was happier, but now I have a purpose. Purpose to write and learn, to become the best version of myself, to take charge of my humanity.</em></p>
<p><em>Humanity needs a new renaissance, and soon. Soon, the hard work of our forefathers will be completely erased from memory. Memory will become a forbidden word, a reminder to us that things were different before, that there was a before, and that since there was a past there is also a future. Future patriots, people like me, will be hunted down and quietly removed from society. Society will be engineered by the elite who never followed their own rules anyway, and the sheep will listen because no other voice is there. There will be no more joy or happiness.</em></p>
<p><em>Happiness is what I am looking for, in the long hours of night. Night is when I can think the most clearly, when my inner voice is the loudest and I don’t have to pretend that I’m someone different. Different people have their own ideas about who I am supposed to be, but none of them are who I am.</em></p>
