    <strong>In the US, only 6% of COVID deaths were pure COVID deaths ie no serious co-morbidities. By comparison, what % of flu deaths are 'pure' flu deaths?</strong>
    <p><p>For example, in the US around 30-40k people die of flu each year. Are these generally 'pure' flu deaths?</p></p>

        <p>I would bet itâ€™s very similar.
What would qualify as a co-morbidity?
Is being over 85 a co-morbidity?</p>

        <p>That number, if you view the annual morbidity reports, is around 5000 per year. These are available on the CDC website, but the info is hard to find. And the vast majority of these are in over 65 years old with comorbidities.</p>

        <p>I read something at least 5 years ago saying that the CDC was adding pneumonia deaths to the influenza death counts.  And emphasizing those high counts whenever there was a campaign to get people to take the flu vaccine.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that getting influenza can <strong>lead</strong> to getting pneumonia, since it happened to me twice in my life.  But it's disingenuous to attribute those pneumonia deaths to influenza.  Apparently they never "lied", because they broke out pure flu deaths from flu+pneumonia, as they are starting to do with covid now.  But they definitely used misdirection when they used flu+pneumonia deaths to scare people into getting the (mostly ineffective) flu vaccines.</p>
