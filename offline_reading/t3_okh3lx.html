    <strong>California has a QR code system for "proof" of vaccination. I have a code. I'm not vaccinated.</strong>
    <p><p>A lot of people in my doomer state of California seem to think that the ridiculous QR code system the government "unveiled" last month will be the be-all-end-all to the pandemic. A lot of large events in California that are happening later on in the summer are requiring local people to show this QR code as "proof" they are vaccinated, so then they will be able to attend the event maskless. No, really. They get a nice "vaccinated" wristband that they have to wear at all times. </p>
<p>Except...I got a QR code somehow. My health insurance info is in the database with a vaccine even though I was never jabbed. I never got the vaccine but will be able to walk around maskless because of someone's...mistake? I highly doubt I'm the only one this has happened to. </p>
<p>If this isn't absolute peak security theater, I don't know what is. I got my code, so I must be "safe" then, right? Right? </p>
<p>Doomers don't like to talk to you when you bring this up and they say it's ridiculous, but I wonder how many other "plague rats" there are in California who also somehow got a completely valid QR code.</p></p>
