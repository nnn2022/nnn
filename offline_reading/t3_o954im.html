<h1>Voice AI is scary good now. Video game actors hate it.</h1>
<p><em>&amp;A new ‘Witcher 3’ mod uses tech that’s ethically questionable and what one actor calls “utterly soulless.” But can anything be done about it?</em>*</p>
<p>&rt;“If this is true, this is just heartbreaking,” tweeted Jay Britton, a voice actor with credits in Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Pathfinder. “Yes, AI might be able to replace things but should it? We literally get to decide. Replacing actors with AI is not only a legal minefield but an utterly soulless choice.”

        <p>Exactly. Now we know why UBI was introduced into the general public discourse a few years back. Because they know the mass unemployment that's on the way.   </p>
<h1>You'll Own Nothing and Be Happy</h1>
<p>This is why all the big companies were sitting on hoards of cash instead of investing it.     </p>
<h1>15 Companies Stockpile $1 Trillion In Cash (And Investors Want It)</h1>
<p>&rt;Just 15 non-financial companies in the S&amp;P 500, including mainly tech giants like Apple (AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and IBD Long-Term Leader Microsoft (MSFT), are sitting on cash and investments of more than a $1 trillion, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of just-released annual 2020 data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence and MarketSmith.  <br>
<strong>This massive cash pile accounts for nearly 40% of the $2.7 trillion held by all of the companies in the S&amp;P 500. S&amp;P 500 companies now have enough cash to give $8,103 to every man, woman and child in the U.S.</strong>

<p>&rt;The <strong>Coalition for Inclusive Capitalism</strong> is dedicated to making capitalism work for everyone. We partner with private, public, and civic sector leaders on initiatives to make capitalism inclusive and its benefits more widely and equitably shared. Together with our partners , we are working for a fairer, more dynamic, and sustainable future for all.<br>

<p>Perfect, isn't it? Because the companies are going to propose paying more in taxes, with money they saved by not paying taxes (Panama Papers, Paradise Papers), to fund UBI for the peons. Never mind they could have been paying fair wages and taxes, plus still making a ton of money.   </p>
<p>But they're more than ahead of the game. For instance:   </p>
<h1>Millionares Against Pitchforks</h1>
<p>&rt;There are two kinds of wealthy people in the world: those who prefer taxes and those who prefer pitchforks. We, the undersigned, prefer taxes. And we believe that, upon reflection, you will as well.</p>
<p>&rt;For that reason, we urge you to step forward now - before it’s too late - to demand higher and fairer taxes on millionaires and billionaires within your own countries and to help prevent individual and corporate tax avoidance and evasion through international tax reform efforts.</p>
<p>&rt;We make this request as members of the most privileged class of human beings ever to walk the earth.</p>

<p>We are walking right into the situation that was already planned out.    </p>
