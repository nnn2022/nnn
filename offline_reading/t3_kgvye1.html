    <strong>It‚Äôs been admitted that the vaccine won‚Äôt prevent the spread just help manage symptoms of Covid. So if that‚Äôs the case why should everyone need to take it?</strong>
    <p><p>This whole time it‚Äôs been fear mongered up because of Asymptomatic spread. Which means you can have mild to no symptoms at all and still spread it. Which was why the whole planet needed to be on a indefinite house arrest for the last year.</p>
<p>So how you want to manage potential symptoms of Covid is on you. It doesn‚Äôt effect or potentially ‚Äúspread‚Äù it to anyone else since the virus can spread asymptomatically. If there was any data saying that the virus is less likely to spread asymptomatically than symptomatic then again why was their a need for the house arrest orders? The vaccine is more so to prevent those vulnerable from having adverse effects so why does it matter if I decide that I want to chance it with my immune system over a vaccine? </p>
<p>With or without it me and anyone else is capable of spreading COVID</p></p>

        <p>Welcome to the Clown Logic.</p>
<p>I mean .. the "official argument" is that they are saving lives by reducing the number of people who have really serious symptoms.</p>
<p>And that will give them some leeway to work on something that <em>really</em> stops infection.</p>
<p>But the way it is described, you are right. There is no real change to the situation.</p>
<p>"You can give someone Covid, and they can pass it to someone who might die from it."</p>
<p>Regardless of who has been vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I feel like at some point (but I can't keep up) they were advising that people who already had covid shouldn't take it because the side effects might be worse. Then they tell us we need two dosesü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>
