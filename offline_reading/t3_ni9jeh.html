    <strong>My hot take</strong>
    <p><p>I mean no hatred to you guys at all but for a sub all against the fear mongering of the "vaccine users" you seem to be pretty afraid of the vaccine. Being afraid of a shot is quite common especially if it is new but you're aware the U.S has some of the most rigorous testing practices to pass the FDA's precautions for a drug like this? Simply claiming that the vaccine is unsafe because you think it may be is ludicrous. I've seen anti mask stuff here as well. Is this the same sort of group that thinks the Earth is flat and climate change is fake? Seriously the most contradictory logic in the posts here are almost saddening. If you guys could provide one ounce of proof that this whole science denying "movement" isn't backed by nothing but conspiracy and fear mongering much like those who you condemn that'd be great! I flared this as discussion because I'm perfectly open for discussion on the subject.</p></p>

<p>No. It is STILL in clinical trials, and will be until 2023.</p>

        <p>Do a search within this sub. There are plenty of posts that cover this question with lots of people answering it. We are tired of seeing this question. Most people ask it and then refuse to listen or just want to insult us. Sorry, not getting an answer from me...I've already said it a hundred times.</p>

        <p>You must obviously not come here often and had time to waste. But I’ll play with a troll for a second, I’m already drinking and in for the night anyways lol. I’m not getting the vaccine because I don’t care how “safe” you claim the FDA regs are, they aren’t. For one many drugs can be found as being discontinued for adverse effects (think Zantac and causing colon cancer) sometimes these things aren’t discovered until 10-20 years post approval. Secondly, there are steps to a drug or vaccine become approved. This process can take up to 3-5 years. The current vaccines are not approved. The FDA has multiple designations for drugs and vaccinations. These designations are those such as authorized for emergency use, authorized, and approved for public use by FDA approval. The current vaccines are in the first category. They have not been through even 1/10 the testing or trial times that Zantac was. It is only authorized because the medical community has labeled Covid-19 a “pandemic.” Remember when Donald Trump was taking an antiviral cocktail not available to the public because it wasn’t FDA approved? Remember how everyone said he was crazy? Remember how the news said it was ridiculous to put such in your body? Well those were authorized for emergency use by his team of doctors, and the media still said, “It’s not approved, not even the public is allowed it. It’s experimental.” I bet you ate that up. So why do you use the same authorization on yourself and why is the media pushing it? Weren’t they not for such 6 months ago? Why now is it ok for such to given out in mass doses to society?</p>

        <p>I mean why give insightful comments to a stupid post. Every post here isn’t grand and some are outright stupid but yours is one of them. Are you aware the vaccine hasn’t passed those rigorous FDA precautions. Are you aware of the record number of VAERS reports. Are you aware that most people advocated that masking post vaccine is stupid, and then the media comes out and vindicates that very sentiment. The CDC posts the most contradictory logic in their edicts so what’s the difference between them and us?</p>

        <p>Trust me dude they don't care, most people on this sub are morons who take what they see on Facebook as the truth. That being said while I despise these people I agree with them more than the pro vax pro mask pro restrictions people. My stance is Pro vax anti mask and restrictions mainly because there is no hard evidence they work, it's all models and studies conducted under limited situations vs the vaccine which has tons of real world data showing it prevents COVID. Hence why as a fully vaccinated person my mask went in the trash as soon as our mandate was gone</p>

        <p>Remember when science said Thalidomide was safe as a sleep sedative alternative? How did that work out long term for the kids born with flipper arms? Yeah real swell there. Now may I ask you a serious question? Why do you follow a community (science) that hasn’t cured anything since Polio. And once they did, they realized how much money they lost, so they resorted to prescribing long term treatments for conditions to keep people alive longer, not for their health or benefit, but so the doctors and science can milk them dry every last drop until they die. Why do you put so much trust into people to cure AIDS when they can’t even cure small problems like dandruff or jock itch? Why are you getting a vaccine that has been proven to not stop the transmission of the virus completely? Every vaccine I’ve ever received wasn’t needed yearly, and I don’t remember the last time I read about a Rubella or Polio outbreak in vaccinated children recently.</p>

        <p>You can even read here how Biden is leaving it up to the military to mandate Covid vaccines. And that is because due to laws and policies created after the 90s anthrax vaccine fiasco, where soldiers were vaccinated with vaccines not fully approved, much like the one you’re pushing for now, and faced many adverse reactions, including some that are still paralyzed waist and neck down for life they can’t mandate unapproved vaccines. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.military.com/daily-news/2021/04/30/biden-making-covid-vaccine-mandatory-troops-im-going-leave-it-military.html/amp</p>
