    <strong>The tide is turning</strong>
    <p><p>In the uk this is the third national lockdown. Idk about anyone else but it’s hitting me the hardest. When I look even on reddit people’s patience is wearing thin. The great thing is once everyone’s grandma is vaccinated no one is going to give a fuck. I can’t wait for the massive pressure switch the government will have to face. They know this is coming, this is why they’re pushing new narratives and shifting the goalposts back. But the truth is people want there lives back and it’s going to be very difficult for the government to continue on with this once the vulnerable have been taken care of.</p></p>

        <p>i see the tide turning. and yet this is almost as angry and low as ive felt yet, other than the crazy fearful feeling of worrying of dying alone or supply chain failing while the virus was new and scary in late march early april.  i’m just fucking steamed at the gaslighting from basically everyone i know, as if I am the one with my facts wrong.  the side by side headline rewrites from before after the biden inauguration, and others really show how this has been led by the media.  I almost dont want to know most of my “friends” anymore at the moment.</p>

        <p>They can drop it tomorrow. None of the laws and changed will be rolled back. But why stop when they are on a winning streak?</p>

        <p>It’s never going to end.</p>
<p>That’s why they are saying there are new mutant strains.</p>
<p>You can bet your ass there will be a new “covid” of some type within the next few years.</p>
<p>It can’t end, because the injections are critical to merging humans with AI, and the only way that can be done on a mass scale is to make this dystopia the new normal.</p>

        <p>Hate to bum you out. But vaccine doesn't work they still want social distancing and masks. Mutant strain will come out. And people will accept anything.</p>
