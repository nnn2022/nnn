<title>Statistic: the UK government has spent £283,915,000,000 on Covid-19 measures (so far), there have been 277,500 Covid hospitalisations (average age of 71) since it began - equating to a cost of over £1,000,000 per patient. Under what other circumstance would we deem these costs reasonable?</title>

    <strong>Statistic: the UK government has spent £283,915,000,000 on Covid-19 measures (so far), there have been 277,500 Covid hospitalisations (average age of 71) since it began - equating to a cost of over £1,000,000 per patient. Under what other circumstance would we deem these costs reasonable?</strong>
    <p><p>Obviously the above government spending figure isn’t direct medical costs, it’s mainly furlough, business bailouts etc., but it’s DIRECTLY associated with Covid so it’s an entirely fair equation to make. Feel like I had to make that point before some doomer tries to ‘well, ACKSHUALLY’ me to avoid answering the question.</p>
<p>For reference, the NHS uses a ‘cost for life years saved’ metric where they calculate the value for money/viability of medical treatment by equating the costs of it against how many years it would extend someone’s life.</p>
<p>So if you got £100,000 worth of treatment and it extends your life by 10 years, that would be £10,000 per year saved. The NHS rule of thumb is that they’ll spend a maximum of £20k-£30k per year saved.</p>
<p>Using the above figures, a 71 year old Covid patient could expect 9 more years (assuming they live to an average age). This is over £100,000 for each year saved when plotted against the government spending, 3.5-5x more than would otherwise be deemed (at the upper end of) reasonable. It would simply never get approved. It would take the average taxpayer 16 years to pay for each single extra year.</p>
<p>And that’s assuming that treatment was evenly spread across the board regardless of age. In reality, the costs will be skewed towards those even older (80+), meaning it is even more mystifying how you can come close to justifying it.</p>
<p>And again, before doomers come at me like again like ‘REEEEE, capitalism is so evil that you care more about money that lives’. First of all, shut up, that is such a disingenuous and inflammatory blanket statement.</p>
<p>And secondly, yes, to some degree, it’s true. Our precious NHS is a shared service, it has to be used fairly by us all. At some point, you have to draw a line at how much you can spend on one patient (as this will be to the detriment of how much you can spend on another patient). This is how it is - and indeed how it should be. The NHS has used these sorts of calculations since its inception.</p>
<p>If there was an experimental cancer treatment that cost £15,000,000 and a 97 year old man wanted to make use of it, it would be an absolutely absurd waste of money when that money could treat 100 20 year old cancer patients not requiring that same experimental treatment. This is the very foundation of how single payer health systems operate. This is the point of them. Value for money and fairness for EVERYONE. No one person is given a disproportionate slice of the pie.</p>
<p>Covid is the same principle. At some point, you need to realise the financial cost of trying to extend old peoples’ lives by minimal amounts is simply not worth it. The expenditure is only going to rise further, and by a lot, only exasperating the issue. And we’re only talking about government spending here, it isn’t even accounting for the further hundreds of billions of GDP lost... or the million other knock-on effects of lockdowns.</p>
<p>We’ll ultimately end up talking in the trillions when all is said and done. And to do what? Extend an old person’s life by a few years, maybe not even that.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely. The government not offering free packages of vitamins, fruit etc. to boost the immune system should ring a bell as well. They're not even talking about it; they rather inject people with a rushed vaccine. (Which was the plan all along.)</p>

        <p>Posted this on r/unitedkingdom too, don’t fully understand how Reddit works but it seems to be in a pending state?</p>
<p>It appears on my profile with greyed out upvotes and downvotes but doesn’t appear on the subreddit when sorted by new.</p>
<p>Will be interested to see how the lockdown-loving userbase of that sub respond to what I’m asking.</p>
