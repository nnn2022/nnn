    <strong>We live in clown world</strong>
    <p><p>When I came to class yesterday my professor asked me where I went for spring break, I told him Alabama and another girl said Florida. </p>
<p>We both said that nobody was wearing masks down there and I said I thought it was great. We started discussing masks and I brought up the fact that our state is about to remove mask mandates. </p>
<p>Some other kids piped up and said "the college president has already said the university is going to keep a campus wide mask mandate" </p>
<p>I said "I don't know about that"</p>
<p>Professor: "if you come in here without a mask you'll get your ass thrown outside"</p>
<p>I had to bite my tongue so hard not to snap on him for that. </p>
<p>I'm so sick of this stupid bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>If Fauci says a butt plug will prevent me from potentially spreading a deadly virus to my fellow human being, then you better believe I'm getting a butt plug. I don't understand why you people can't just wear a mask for the sake of other people's health, are you really this selfish? If by some bizarre plot twist it turns out you people are right, and Covid was just some hoax to make people wear a mask for some reason, then I wouldn't regret a thing. I'll be proud I took precautions that I thought would help protect the people around me. Why can't you do the same? I promise masks don't bite</p>

        <p>I was specifically talking about masks. You're the one that brought your hole into this. I just want to know, why are you people so opposed to wearing a mask when they protect another person's health? Do you actually think there's a government mind control device in there?

        <p>There's plenty of "known and published science" that would argue the exact opposite but okay. Now, I'd like to ask another question. I've already acknowledged how I'd feel if it somehow turned out I was wrong: I'd be happy I did my best to protect others. How would you feel though? How would you feel if you found out that you put the lives of others at risk just because you didn't want to put something on your face for a bit? I'm also genuinely curious as to what you think their secret motive is.</p>

        <p>&rt;How would you feel if you found out that you put the lives of others at  risk just because you didn't want to put something on your face for a  bit? </p>
<p>I'm not the person you asked, but I'll answer all the same. I wouldn't give a fuck. You know why? Other people's health is NOT my responsibility. Everyone is responsible for their own health and well-being, and blaming other people for "getting you sick" is not only a really dangerous precedent, but is also just flat out ignorant.</p>
<p>That's not to say it's alright to cough in someone's face, or purposely get someone sick. That is assault, and should be treated as such. But treating every single person you come across as just a biological vector of disease and not AN ACTUAL PERSON is incredibly fucked up and dangerous, and if you don't see how then there is no hope for you.</p>
<p>Before the covid bullshit, did you ever leave your house when you were sick? Maybe you just had a little cold, nothing major, and needed to go to the store to get medicine. Or you didn't have any sick days, so you powered through work anyway despite feeling ill. Not a big deal right? Well, according to your own logic, you may have INFECTED people! They may have even DIED! Did you care? I guarantee you did not even THINK about it back then, let alone care.</p>
<p>Life is about risks, both assessing them and accepting them as a reality. If you are truly so at risk from a respiratory virus with a 99.9% survival rate, then you should take care of your OWN health. Expecting everyone else to care for you is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>Go ahead, call me selfish, call me a horrible person, call me whatever the fuck you want, I don't fucking care. I cannot afford to care about every single person on the planet, because my shoulders are not strong enough to bear all that weight. People die all the time. Get the fuck over it.</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if you misunderstood me, or if you're willingly twisting my words. I agree, nobody should worry about the health of everyone on Earth, never once did I say I expected this. I don't know why you think I'd single out a person and blame them if I were to get sick, I wouldn't. I do think that each person should do their best to protect themselves and those they're around. For example, when we drive, it's our choice to wear a seatbelt and whatnot, because it only impacts us. But we should follow the speed limit, stop at the lights and signs, and pay attention to the road because those actions could impact somebody else, no matter how many precautions they've taken to ensure they're safety. I accept that everyone could do everything in their power to protect themselves and others and it may still be spread, I wouldn't blame anyone for this. I'm actually offended that you think I don't see people as PEOPLE. If you've actually read through anything that I've posted you'd see that I'm talking about protecting others, not myself. I don't worry that someone else may get me sick, I worry that I may unknowingly harm someone else BECAUSE I see them as a person, who has a life and is connected to others that love them. 
I'll be the first to admit that I've given others the flu before. I can confirm that none of them died. The reason that I didn't worry then is because we can treat the flu much better than we can treat Covid. 
You keep speaking as if I'm say everyone should protect ME. That's not what I'm saying. I only think people should try to protect those that they're exposing themselves to. A person can put their seatbelt on, follow the speed limit, and drive safely, but that doesn't mean anything if some half asleep drunk driver comes by.
I'm not going to call you names because I have no right to. I don't know why you expect me to. I need to repeat that I don't expect anyone to care about everyone on the planet, just those that they're exposing themselves to. I know people die, but if I can help to prevent them from meeting an early grave, then why wouldn't I? I just can't understand why others don't feel the same?</p>

        <p>OK so, you do know how to wear a mask right? It goes over your nose and mouth, not your eyes. You may also want to look into getting some glasses if the visual problems persist. As for the breathing, what do you even mean? Are you wearing 10 masks at a time? I've worn a mask for hours before and never once struggled to breathe. Maybe you've got some lung problems you should go get checked out. Also, good news! You don't have to wear a mask you're whole life! Just when you're in public places around others! Then again, if you've got such a serious breathing issue, maybe you shouldn't be out and about so much during this pandemic. Take care bud :)</p>

        <p>I can't see with it <em>because</em> I wear glasses.</p>
<p>Long before this "pandemic" ever started, I tried my hardest to find SOME kind of mask that I could wear in my woodworking shop. I never was able to find a type of mask or method of wearing that didn't immediately fog my glasses over. I am legally blind without them, and I can't wear contacts.</p>
<p>You're point about breathing is meaningless word vomit. Your experience means nothing in the context of others' experience. You can gaslight all you like, but it doesn't make my experience in my life any less real, it just makes you an asshole.</p>
<p>Lastly, I'd like to remind you, since you're such an obedient little government lover, to cover your mouth back up, go back over to your safe socially distanced corner, shut the fuck up, and let the adults do the talking.</p>

        <p>Y'know what? I'll do it. I'll apologize. I apologize for forgetting that glasses and masks don't mix and forgetting that others may have troubles breathing. I'm not too big to apologize. I wouldn't say that I was "gaslighting" but if you'd like to, then that's your right I suppose. Same with calling me an asshole. I'm just a guy with an opinion on the internet, like you. I really didn't like the label of "obedient little government lover" though, as that's so incredibly far off from what I am it's insulting. I wear a mask because I think it allows me to make sure I won't negatively impact the health of another. I also don't think that you should have the right to tell me not to speak. This is the internet. It's a megaphone that anyone can tell into if they want.</p>

        <p>You're missing so much</p>
<p>The people you are constantly shitting on are the ones who have health issues and trouble wearing the mask or know ppl like that and ppl like you are screaming at them in the grocery store to put a mask on for someone's health. </p>
<p>There are 100s of categories of ppl who can't or won't wear a mask. If you can't remember glasses and masks don't mix while telling someone to get glasses maybe you're not qualified to judge people on this</p>
<p>ETA: and let's not forget you're still operating off false pretenses that a healthy, non-coughing human can protect someone else by wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>I know I’m not going to change your mind. I can only speak for myself and I’ll try to explain it, I’ve got nothing to lose except a little bit of time. I think there’s a fundamental disagreement between people who are pro-mask and people who are anti-mask. Personally I am Anti-Hysteria. I think wearing a mask in the current state of affairs (I live on the east coast in the US) is unnecessary. I was all aboard the “flatten the curve” strategy. But the goal post has been repeatedly moved back to increasingly illogical standards. It went from “flatten the curve” to “zeroism”. When I say zeroism I mean that for some people and some policy makers the only acceptable option as a society is to have zero cases of COVID or zero fatalities, depending on who you ask. I fundamentally disagree with this for various reasons that I think stem from a philosophical stand point but I’m not going to get into it unless for some reason this reply blows up and a lot of people chime in. But that is besides the point, I think wearing a mask now has turned into a virtue signaling pastime that people use to shame others into complying just to make themselves feel good and morally superior. The reasons for this are the following: The IFR for COVID is 0.05% for people under 70.  Evidence is mounting that asymptotic spread is rare. Over 50 million people (at least) have been vaccinated, another 70 million (at least) have the antibodies because of previous infection, another 70 million people are under 18 years of age and their fatality rate and risk is virtually zero (99.997% survival rate for ppl 19 and under- cdc stats). Furthermore 80% of hospitalized COVID patients were overweight or obese. The risk to reaction ratio is extremely overblown in my opinion and I think it is best and also morally correct that individuals take their health into their own hands. If someone is afraid of COVID (they shouldn’t be) unless they are overweight, diabetic, etc.. (their fault), then they can take personal responsibility and double, triple, and quadruple mask up. That being said, I think it is insane that I can walk into a restaurant (mask required), sit down, have an hour long conversation without a mask (perfectly acceptable for some reason) and then stand up and put my mask on to leave or go to the bathroom. That is just one example of the madness and virtue signaling I see daily. I also play indoor soccer at 2 separate facilities. The first is more lax with the mask none sense (only required when going in through the front desk area). The second is a mix between half baked county policy and a good dose of virtue signaling, the masks are required while we play, run and sweat BUT if you are under 18 you don’t need a mask. It makes no sense and infuriates me. I also think children wearing masks in the classroom is madness. And to conclude I think people should do what they decide is best for them, if you want a mask or 10 go for it, if you want people to enter your business with a mask then go for it, but allow for the alternate possibility as well and let people decide individually. The hospitals are not overrun, that excuse is long gone.</p>

        <p>Because they don't protect another person's health. </p>
<p>Only if you are actively coughing in my space does it protect someone's health. Which means you would have to come in public sick and coughing. That's not how masks work, and you can ask osha if you like. </p>
<p>Now here's where you're actually very very wrong. The fact that you feel comfortable leaving your house feeling a bit unwell with a cough because you think if everyone is wearing masks we are all protected. But you've got your germs on your hands and touch everything due to your poorly placed judgement due to being misinformed about what a mask is actually capable of doing. </p>
<p>Now I'm not going to say "you people" or call you a "selfish grandma killer" because that's nonsense, but I would encourage you to look up what a mask is ACTUALLY capable of doing, think critically, and realize your entire viewpoints about people who won't wear them is based on misinformation </p>
<p>I would also encourage you to look into EO and it's usage in masks after you've looked up osha ppe policies on mask capabilities. </p>
<p>Since you and many others won't, </p>
<p>EO causes brain cancer and many masks are covered in it.</p>

        <p>Listen, you make a valid point. Personally, I am 100% okay with sacrificing convenience for the safety of others. But you're missing the big picture of the anti-mask movement. The way our leaders have generally been handling the covid situation has been widely irresponsible, and we've seen outrageous power grabs like we've never seen before. The country is genuinely being destroyed by politicians who are thirsty for power, and a fraction of its citizens are either completely okay with it or completely naive to it. It has to stop. I would like to take precautions because the fact is covid is real. But unfortunately, we've learned that if you give the government an inch, they take a mile, then 10, then 100, and they're causing irreversible damage. So we're putting our foot down. No more inches. No more miles.</p>
