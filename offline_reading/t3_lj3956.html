        <p>As a customer was checking out the other day:</p>
<p>Her: I got the second shot and I’ve been sick ever since.</p>
<p>Me: I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p>Her: it’s made getting out and doing things difficult</p>
<p>Me: makes you wonder why you even got it.</p>
<p>Her: well I mean...</p>
<p>She just pays and leaves. Next customer walks up.</p>
<p>Her: did that woman say she was sick?</p>
<p>Me: she said she has been sick since she got the second vaccine shot.</p>

        <p>well no vaccine guarantees that you won't get the virus, it just makes it much, much less likely. and eventually once enough people are vaccinated, there won't be any need for a mask mandate/lockdowns, etc, so shouldn't you guys be in favor of being vaccinated?</p>

        <p>Ok, first off, who are "they?" I'm guessing you mean like the government or something, maybe the CDC?</p>
<p>I don't have any percentages or anything for you, but it should be obvious that masks are a temporary measure to reduce the spread of the virus. Once more people are vaccinated, the number of new coronavirus cases per day is going to drop. And eventually things will go back to normal. As far as specifics, that's going to depend on what country/state/city you're in, what the laws there are like, and how well the virus is being contained there. Look at New Zealand, even without a majority of the population vaccinated, they've managed to contain the virus with testing, contact tracing, social distancing, and mask wearing. As a result, the covid-related restrictions in New Zealand have been eased considerably compared to much of the US. </p>
<p>Why would you think masks, social distancing, and lockdowns are going to stay even after we contain the virus?</p>

<p>You are assuming they will say everything is fine and go back to how things were. I've seen enough BS from local and federal governments to know they will use this pandemic to shove more shit down our throats and then reward us by letting us take off the mask while still following every little rule they are putting out.</p>

        <p>Im sorry to hear that. It is never okay to lose someone and I sympathize with your loss. Maybe the vaccine would have helped your father or perhaps the hydroxy treatment. This anecdotal experience of the .002% that do die from COVID does not change the fact that the  99.98% do not need it. Our immune systems are more than enough. Again, sorry for your loss.</p>

        <p>That was a tasteful response.  I’d love to see more interactions like this here (on Reddit at large not just this sub).  Just because we have different values and opinions,  doesn’t mean we shouldn’t show empathy! </p>
<p>If both sides took the time to listen to each other maybe we wouldn’t be in this mess?  That said,  I think both sides are becoming unified on the fact this whole situation is a giant mess!  I think you’d have to be drinking a lot of your tribes koolaid to not admit this is a mess?</p>

        <p>Tasteful? Maybe. Factual? No.</p>
<p>The kind of misinformation this fool is spreading is precisely the reason this pandemic has been as bad as it's been in the U.S. There's a clear line to be drawn from this sort of behavior to the deaths of thousands, not to mention economic and social damages.</p>
<p>To be honest I don't know the best way to respond to the sort of blatant misinformation and willful ignorance this person is embracing anymore, but I don't think the answer is "listen to both sides."</p>

        <p>I'm not sure I see the blatant misinformation.  Let's unpack this, this is what was said:</p>
<ul>
<li>vaccine MAY have helped </li>
<li>hydroxychloroquine MAY have helped</li>
<li>survival rate of a of 39 year old (for the sake of argument, let's say someone with no pre-existing medical conditions) is 99.98%</li>

        <p>Well, I was addressing the information of the person you commented on. The one who said:</p>
<p>&rt;Getting the “vaccine” is entirely pointless.</p>
<p>~~Hydroxy early on was thought to maybe help, due to one~~ <a href="https://www.henryford.com/news/2020/07/hydro-treatment-study">~~study~~</a>  ~~in particular that has since been called into question. There have been numerous~~ <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/06/three-big-studies-dim-hopes-hydroxychloroquine-can-treat-or-prevent-covid-19">~~studies~~</a> ~~since disputing this claim, and the ones that said it might have been helpful were~~ ~~retracted~~~~.~~ Edit: I'm mistaken on this one, I don't think the data is clear, and one link I cited was incorrectly used (not relevant).</p>
<p>There was no mention of age group restriction, just the broad claim that only .02% die. The actual number is .17% currently, and it was worse earlier when treatments weren't as established.</p>
<p>What's problematic here is that I shouldn't need to educate you (I'm not an expert), nor should the facts of this pandemic be a "listen to both sides" discussion when one side is stating clear falsehoods. I'm not trying to shit fling, it's just so tiring to hear that this should still be a "discussion" a year in when the facts are well established.</p>

        <p>Thanks for being open to dialog, and not being a combative shite :-)</p>
<p>I'm not sure I agree with your assessment, but that is ok we don't have to.  You said it yourself, we don't have the facts.  So in effect, how can you be so sure they are spreading blatant mis-information?  Perhaps you are attempting to control the propagation of opinions you don't agree with (just assuming)?  What are you objectives coming to sub where you know full well what the attitudes and opinions are on these issues?  I don't come here to learn about the benefits of covid vaccines, there are many other good subs for that.  I don't know your approach is very persuasive, for me at least.   I'm kind undecided on the covid vaccine myself and am wanting to explore all sides of the discourse.  I kind of envy your position though, it would be much easier right now that's for sure.  </p>
<p>Awesome you edited your comment btw, not many would do that.  You seem like an alright person.  Take care!</p>

        <p>I suppose I commented on this post out of a mixture of frustration and incredulity, and to be honest I didn't expect to be persuasive. Perhaps not the best motives, I'll admit. I appreciate your discussion though.</p>
<p>In some cases, yes, we don't have all the facts. I thought I had done my research on HCQ, but I learned about the retraction of the Lancet study and other elements that changed my mind (now I'm at least agnostic), and I think that's great. Do I think any/all Covid vaccines will be and are as effective as they claim? Yet to be seen. Do I think we fully know the effects of the pandemic (death toll, side effects, etc.) a year on? Yet to be seen.</p>
<p>BUT we can be certain that vaccines in general <em>work</em> and that--while it's true Covid vaccines may not be 100% effective--they are very likely our best shot at a return to normal life (though I suppose "forget about it and move on" is another proposal). We can also be reasonably certain that the death toll from Covid falls somewhere in the range of 400-500k for 2020 upon analysis of excess death data, giving us a death rate much higher than .02% as claimed above.</p>
<p>If I'm wrong or misinformed on any point, I'd want to know. Skepticism is great, but when skepticism requires you to believe that swathes of people are all lying to you for some nefarious purpose, I prefer to err on the side of data/experts/science.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the original post here. If it is to be taken seriously, I am to believe that vaccine manufacturers, governments, health providers, doctors, and scientists are all in on a conspiracy to vaccinate entire populations with vaccines that don't actually work for... some unstated reason? That's the buy-in for this claim, and I don't think a reasonable person can do that.</p>
<p>Perhaps I sound like a fool, and there's some obvious information I'm missing, but if there is I'd want to know it.</p>

        <p>Thank you, but You are spreading misinformation and have the wrong statistics as it’s more than 0.002% of people who die from Covid. Even if there’s a small percentage who die, that percentage can be lowered by wearing a mask, social distancing and getting vaccinated. Thinking like this is one of the reasons we are still in a pandemic.</p>

        <p>who said that? you little rascal, you're just making things up now, arent you? masks aren't gonna be here forever, so you can just settle down. once enough people are vaccinated, there won't be any need to continue wearing masks, so if you're really anti-mask, do your part and get vacc'd. </p>
<p>Vaccines really do work, like when was the last time you heard about someone getting polio or smallpox? People don't get those anymore cuz we did such a good job vaccinating everyone. We don't even give out the smallpox vaccine any more because smallpox has effectively been eradicated. You may be afraid of needles or whatever, but unfortunately, vaccination is the most effective way we have to get rid of diseases.</p>

        <p>Based on research, it is likely that COVID-19 vaccines will prevent  people from getting and spreading the virus. The research studies for  the Moderna vaccine showed the vaccine prevented COVID-19 in about 95  out of 100 people and severe COVID-19 in 100 out of 100 people.    </p>

        <p>dude, i don't think arguing semantics is very productive, but you pushed me into a corner so here we are.
From Merriam-Webster's dictionary: </p>
<p>Likely - having a high probability of occurring or being true : very probable </p>
<p>Maybe - (it redirects to Perhaps) - possibly but not certainly</p>
<p>Sources:</p>
<p>https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/likely</p>

<p>maybe you shouldve looked these up in a dictionary before getting all smug on me</p>
<p>Anyways, you don't have to be a scientist to read a scientific journal. You're not gonna understand every word of it, and neither did I when I read it of course, but you can still check out the actual statistics of the efficacy of the vaccine.</p>

<p>I think they word it the way they do because right now the evidence shows that the vaccine is effective. However, science is very rarely able to give exact answers, so there is a small chance that later research may disprove their current findings, although there is currently no evidence to suggest that is likely to happen.</p>

        <p>I used to get all worried about the health stuff, every week I had a different sign of cancer or other illness and I was starting to develop anxiety and depression due to my bleak outlook on life. Clinically diagnosed. The pills made it worse and I finally said enough is enough. I looked into Taoism among other disciplines/religion. I studied them long enough to find the common similarities between them. I realized that if these are all the same thing and I have no power over anything then why am I worrying? My anxiety and depression are still here sometimes but I don’t see them as something outside of me or something controlling me. I see them as a reaction to a stimulus. Your world is shitty sometimes and you have to feel bad. Or you’re doing something wrong and you have to be anxious about it. Once I got a grip on these things and realized that I am the one controlling them and they were actually signs from god/allah/Buddha/the universe I was much more contented with life. If I am hungry I eat. If I’m thirsty I drink. If I have a headache I drink water and if it doesn’t go away I take a nap or a Tylenol. If I’m bored I go outside and look at nature or get on Reddit when it’s raining and argue with people over my rights lol. One day I will die. I have made peace with that. Will I resist it when it comes? Probably. I think that’s natural tho. I’m not going to waste good time worrying about a bad time. The way I see it, If this virus is going to wipe out the earth then there’s nothing we can do. Truth be told, I probably don’t go out as much as you. I maybe go to the store twice a month and it’s pick up. My job is shut down for the winter so I don’t have to leave my house and I live In the woods. However I’m told that because there’s a virus I’m supposed to be afraid and worry? No, it’s fear mongering. They took away MY RIGHT when they said it wasn’t my health at risk but YOURS. So I could be killing you by not wearing a mask. Common sense says yes, wearing a mask will reduce the speed at which air particles leave you mouth and travel in any direction. Common sense also says, a mask should work both ways where If you wear one, I can’t infect you or it reduces the chance. They completely disregard that thought, therefore my common sense is now null and void to “science”. I don’t want anyone to get sick. Some of us will. That’s life. The seed takes in the water to grow to a tree. The leaves take in the sunlight to feed the tree. The tree dies and feeds the ground so it can nourish the next seed. I understand why you feel what you feel. I see that the answers are clearly laid out in a way that you can grasp and soothe yourself with them. But understand that through an objective mind, looking at both sides and realizing there IS a middle ground, is the only way to find the “truth”. Even then, it’s only your truth. Just don’t force it on others.</p>

        <p>Seems like you're engaging in a lot of wishful thinking. I sure hope you're right and things do go back to normal but I absolutely understand why almost everyone in this sub doesn't believe it will, at least not without a fight. This started as "2 weeks" to slow the spread. Then it turned into a couple months. Then it was just until the hospitals weren't overwhelmed. After that this new normal would continue until all the vulnerable are vaccinated. In my opinion it's ridiculous not to suspect the tyrants will move the goalpost again.</p>

        <p>What exactly do you think is the end goal of these "tyrants?" Look man, all people wanna do is contain this virus, that's it. Once people are vaccinated, the virus will be contained. It's not some big conspiracy. The restrictions most states have in place are generally based on how sever the covid situation is there, ie more cases = more restrictions. Administering a vaccine that is 95% effective will objectively lower the number of cases. Less cases means there will no longer be a necessity for any lockdowns, stay at home orders, masks, etc.</p>
<p>It's so bizarre to me how you people claim to be "anti-mask, anti-lockdown, anti-social distance," and yet you won't do anything to make it so that we don't need masks or lockdowns. Me, I'm actually anti-mask, wearing a mask is fucking annoying. But, I know that so long as I wear my mask and get my vaccine once I'm able, eventually there won't be any need to wear my mask. The problem is people like you doing everything you can to keep covid around as long as possible.</p>

        <p>If you think the small amount of people not wearing masks is why life is still like this you're delusional. And the goal of the tyrants is to hold on to this power. You don't think they enjoy being able to control which businesses are open, where people are allowed to go, what they can do etc.? And what a surprise that once the vaccine is being rolled out, the media starts fear mongering about another variant! Well duh, viruses mutate we know this. Anti-maskers and people who don't comply aren't the problem, it's people like you keeping up the fear and shaming people who want to live life again. Just think about this: If the media never told us there was a pandemic, we'd have no idea.</p>

        <p>You made the claim, your anger at being asked for a source shows your claim was absolute utter garbage, like your opinion. Hospitals are full in areas with high covid infection rates. Obviously places where it’s low (the kind who wore masks, socially distanced, worked from home) this isn’t the case. Duh. </p>
<p>Nope. The point was „why do I have to wear a mask“ and I compared it to the seatbelt, because it too doesn’t protect perfectly, but like a seatbelt, it’s just universally accepted that the minor restriction is worth the safety.</p>

        <p>Okay, you do know those disprove your „99.9%“ claim, right? Especially for older people, where the death rate is even over 5%? </p>
<p>And who’s gonna work there? Medical personell is already overwhelmed in covid heavy areas. There is a severe lack of medical personell pretty much everywhere. Nit to mention equipment. It’s not the lack of buildings you genius.</p>

        <p>And elders are what % of population? For everyone from 0-69, it's 99% survival rate.  All we had to as cruel it us, lock elderly up &amp; let everyone else keep lives busy.</p>

<p>No, they're not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tiktok+dancing+hospitals">overwhelmed</a>. They wasting their time and PPE dancing on tiktok...

        <p>True, under the conditions where there’s enough personell, respirators, beds etc. the younger part of the population is likely to survive. You know, unless they’re athmatic. Or have an immune system deficiency, likely my girlfriend and her father, both from cancer. 
And even then it’s not without possible permanent side effects and lung damage. These are the people who have isolated themselves almost completely, because they know the virus is an active danger to them.</p>
<p>Then there’s the possibility of mutation. We’ve seen severe mutations of the strain in just a single year. Guess which country they stemmed from, the ones where it ran rampant or the ones with serious and effective measures? </p>
<p>Uhm, what do you care what one hospital staff does in their free time? Do you expect these people to work 24/7? Tirelessly just so you can get a haircut? </p>
<p>https://youtu.be/WEgG-Qhc1iQ here, proof poverty and hunger aren’t a problem in Africa. 
This is literally how you argue. </p>
<p>None of these people cite evidence. You know, like this: https://youtu.be/28_EeNG_x5E</p>
<p>Of course this doesn’t mean EVERY hospital has issues, but the ones with high covid rates do. And if we had more covid cases, this would only get worse EVERYWHERE. Some of thses nurses wear masks around their children because they know the risk. </p>
<p>How are you arrogant enough that you think you know a virus better than doctors, nurses and epidemiologists? Seriously, your entire echochamber right wing sub circlejerks. None of you may think that the problems of COVID are largely the political response, the lack of support, the healthcare issue. Of course it sucks, because the American response was one of the worst in the world. But that’s your fault, masks, social distancing &amp; lockdowns still work.</p>

        <p>Not everyone has an airbag. They are able to be disabled. No law mandates their use; you choose to use them if your vehicle has them, and you can shut them off.</p>
<p>Your seatbelt is indeed just like this particular vaccine. It keeps you safe in the event you crash, but doesn't protect any other person. If you put yours on, but your family members in the car don't, you'll be safer from injury than they will be.</p>

        <p>It is indeed factual, the more measures you take to prevent something the more protected you are from the thing. A seatbelt might stop your body and an airbag might protect your head, they complement each other, COVID is no so different</p>
