    <strong>Just your daily reminder that we are not “an echo chamber”</strong>
    <p><p>Every moment in political history, there was a small group that knew what was going on was not okay. And at that time, that group was always spit on, imprisoned, mocked, judged, and exiled. Especially in the name of science. </p>
<p>Remember when they were discovering the planets and all that and Galileo was the only guy right about what was going and everyone thought he was a brainless fool because his opinion was different? The thing about science is that those who truly understand the evolution of science knows that it changes, it has an ebb and flow, discoveries we thought were concrete truth end up being completely wrong down the line. </p>
<p>We should ALWAYS be questioning, learning, digging. That is the <em>whole point of the scientific method</em>. Hell, 50 years the FDA and government said smoking was healthy for pregnant women. How many commercials do you see saying people can get financial compensation for taking x medication? MAINSTREAM MEDICINE IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT. They will not know they are right until years later, because that is the proper amount of time it takes to see real testing and results. </p>
<p>We see the holes, the fake stories, we understand the emotion and manipulation. We are equipped with knowledge and discovery which is the most threatening thing to the powers that be. We already have seen countless times in history that the sheep will always go with the herd, because being the one mocked and ridiculed takes a lot of fucking strength that they don’t have. </p>
<p>So don’t let the people get you down who are willing to throw their neighbors under the bus in a second. The ones who cheer at people getting yanked out of stores, the people with no real love or empathy in their soul so they need to use the pandemic to pretend they do. Because they never did anything good for anyone in their life before so this is their only chance to pretend to be a hero cuz their government said so. </p>
<p>In all honesty, we should feel bad for these people. Rich, corrupt politicians are more important to them than their own family. That’s really sad. But keep being you. The truth will always reveal itself, and we know this will crumble. Cuz remember in history that the good guys always won, even if it took a little bit. </p>
<p>Love y’all.</p></p>

        <p>Nothing in this post justifies your thesis.</p>
<p>Yes of course science requires the vigilance of always questioning, learning, and discovering, but the separation of good science and bad science is the willingness to throw away your predispositions and let all of the data lead you to the best representation of the truth that you can know with the data on hand.</p>
<p>Instead, let's highlight some examples (a more thorough meta-analysis will have to wait) to provide indications of this being an echo-chamber like any other:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/klpx7q/woke_ass_doctors_office/">3rd Most Upvoted Post</a>: Vast majority of the comments are questioning the details of the posted image, e.g. Ebola outbreak in WEstern Africa has been going on since Dec 2013 and the Zika outbreak started in 2013 as well, but became an epidemic in the Americas in 2015).  There are many notable inconsistencies in the data, altered slightly one might presume to try to make a point that is not fully supported by the evidence.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/klqmh6/fuk_outta_here/">2nd</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/klvvlt/tiktok_nurses_have_been_the_real_heroes/">6th</a> Most Upvoted Posts:  Unfairly uses one instance of nurses/doctors posting a video to minimize the efforts of those working countless hours to be on the frontline of this pandemic.  Comparing one photo of a field hospital during the 1918 pandemic to a dancing video without any context.  Where are the discussions of putting these in context? Where is the questioning of are these really representative?  Where is the discovery of understanding why, how and to what end the video in question was made?  Instead, the threads read more like a perfunctory piling up on those who are treating the pandemic with an open eye and trying to understand and limit its impact.</p>
<p>And to be fair, there was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/klw6z4/what_about_this_is_insane_please_tell_me/">this post</a> that attempted to ask a question about a post from another sub, but again there aren't a lot of facts in that thread. Instead there are a lot of references to communists and would-be Nazi's (albeit in the context of "if they were in 1930's Germany).  Not exactly the open forum of ideas and discussion.</p>
<p>So before you pat yourselves on the back, at least try to create the community you are trying to say you are creating.  That includes questioning your own preconceived notions and beliefs.</p>
<p>And if you'd like to question my choice in posts, please find a couple of posts in the top 25 most upvoted that exhibit something that is not an echo chamber.</p>
<p>Edit:  But let's see if anyone responds with data or just insults?  Maybe the moderator will just remove this?</p>

        <p>This seems to be one of the first things people says these days. It's pretty much like saying I saw a persopn go to church once and I don't believe in god so whatever that person who went into the chuiirch says is forever wrong.   </p>
<p>I think you should find a new hobby than going through post histories, and just stick to what's written. If you do insist that whatever has been said in the past then you are very aware what fauci for example has said in the past right? &rt;If you wore a mask oine single time during this pandemic you're a total hypocrite with your comment.   </p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
