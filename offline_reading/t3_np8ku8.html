    <strong>I refuse to get the shot, but my friend DID get the shot. I’ve had no period for over two months since she got her shot. I think her vaccine is effecting my body</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve had so many pro-covid-vaxx people on Reddit tell me I’m an idiot or crazy, but I don’t care. I need to vent and I’m pissed off and confused. I’m 28/F normally healthy and normal periods PRIOR to this. My friend is in her 50s (she’s my neighbor, we hangout almost every night). She got the shot two months ago. I have NOT gotten the shot. Since her shot two months ago, I have had NO PERIOD in over TWO MONTHS. This is NOT normal for me. I don’t care if people think I sound crazy, this isn’t normal. I want kids someday. This is fucking with my head. I honestly am starting to wonder if her being vaccinated has effected my fertility. She’s already done having kids so she’s not worried about the shot effecting her fertility, but I don’t have kids yet and I do want them someday. I have nowhere else to talk about this without people thinking I’m crazy (I swear I’m not crazy, I’m just trying to look at this from all angles). Opinions? I want to be a mother someday and this deeply bothers me</p>
<p>EDIT I might as well just add this here since a lot of people didn’t see my comment: women catch periods from other women just by being around each other. This is biology. Our bodies know when another woman is on her period and it makes our own period start. Our bodies do this to stay fertile with the other females, this has happened since the dawn of time. It’s been a running joke with the women in my family for decades. Anytime I have a female relative or friend over, if she’s on her period, mine will start just from being around her. Even if my own period just ended, I’ll end up with TWO periods in one month just by being around another woman who is on her period. This is biology, women’s bodies effect other women’s fertility.</p></p>

        <p>There could be a lot of factors that you should discuss with your doctor. Any changes in health can stop a period, as can stress, and of course, as can pregnancy. There is scuttle that the spike proteins being shed from the vaccinated are affecting women in strange ways, but there are currently no official studies that I’m aware of, so as of right now it’s grain-of-salt talk. I’m not sure if you’re shilling or not, so I’m going to treat you like you aren’t and highly recommend you see your doctor.</p>

        <p>I'm really starting to think that there is something to this. I didn't receive the vaxx, but a close friend of mine (male) did. We hang out about twice a month for five or six hours each visit. Since he received his vaxx, I noticed that I felt like I was coming down with something after each visit. After he got his second shot it was more pronounced. I normally have a very regular period, but I started ten days early after we hung out. Then after we hung out the following month, I had a terrible endo flare up. Maybe it's just coincidence, but the amount of anecdotal reports of women having disrupted cycles or extreme mood swings/PMS symptoms does make me wonder.</p>

        <p>Every time I’m around a vaccinated individual I fell ill. I mean terrible headache, insanely tired and weak. My periods have been off since before covid lockdowns started, so I can’t speak for that. However, my sister who was pregnant was around my father a lot who got vaccinated. The first shot, she started bleeding abnormally for no reason, fearing she would lose her child. The second shot he got, she delivered the baby prematurely at 34 weeks. Trust your gut, something is very wrong. As soon as I’m away from my father, the next day I already feel better. As difficult as it may be, maybe try to have a conversation with her about your concerns, and see if some time apart helps you return to normal. Best of luck!</p>

        <p>If you’re missing your period for that long and aren’t pregnant, you should talk about it with your doctor. Periods can stop for a whole host of problems, and since vaccination rates are so high, I think there’s a decent chance that when anything changes in our body’s rhythm these days, we could all point to someone close to us who’s been vaccinated and that could be from sheer chance. In any case, it’s probably best to get it checked sooner rather than later, especially if you know you want kids.</p>

There is virtually no way of knowing if a woman is on her period other than it will make MY period start. And then I ask her if she’s on her period, and surprise surprise, she sure is!

        <p>That you assume anyone who disagrees with you is male just proves yet again how stupid you are. Any person capable of reading and understanding the research disagrees with you. “Catching” a period from another woman is just as absurd a concept as catching cooties. Menstrual synchronisation is not a thing and the one study that suggests it is has been thoroughly discredited. What’s going on with you is a classic case of someone being too stupid to recognise their own stupidity.</p>

        <p>No, it isn't. It is known and documented that females living in the same home 'synchronize' their cycles due to pheromones and hormones that each gives off.</p>
<p>A 'new' female coming into a home CAN have the hormones/pheromones of the other females in the home make her period start earlier than it should based on her past period history.</p>

        <p>It is not. In fact, once two women share a cycle, the next ones start to DIVERGE from one another. The only reason why people believe it is confirmation bias, the times you start a period on your own, it doesn’t stand out, but when you start around the same time as a buddy, that data stands out to you (a cool event). </p>
<p>But it’s just a coincidence, there are so many nuances involved with mensuration (stress, diet, exercise, to name a few).</p>
