    <strong>NoNewNormal.Win Status (February 16th)</strong>
    <p><p>Hi everyone. I have reason to believe we have a fire on board our ship.</p>
<p>My name is Hank and I'm the one leading the development of <a href="https://NoNewNormal.Win">NoNewNormal.Win</a>. I have been hesitant to push this harder without a working site, but with the recent 'activity', the timeline must be accelerated. We have had this project in the works for some months now.</p>
<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>We are building a community similar to this sub, but with some NNN twists, namely, we are going to allow users to connect with other users nearby to form maskless shopping groups, meetups or just sharing stuff that you can't share in your local FB group. We will also have a chat feature so we don't have to rely on Discord.</p>
<p>In short</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to this sub</li>
<li>Similar to a local Facebook group (except you don't get canceled)</li>
<li>Chat features</li>
<li>A site with leadership who are ALL NNN with no administrators to worry about.</li>
<li>We are non partisan and share a single goal...... NO NEW NORMAL. Right, left, center, libertarian. We all need to unite one this mission. Strength in numbers.</li>
<li>Not a 'been there done that' Reddit clone constricted to one corner of the internet. This will be FRESH and FUN.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are approximately 40% of the way there but can realistically open for a super rough beta in 3 weeks, but time will tell.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO PARTICIPATE</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://nonewnormal.win">https://nonewnormal.win</a></li>
<li>Sign up for the mailing list and we will notify you when the site is online OR</li>
<li>Bookmark the page and check back in the next month ...</li>
<li>Optionally join us and chat in Discord. We are a really fun little group!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IN CLOSING</strong></p>
<p>I really hope we can get upvotes here. I plead you to all sign up to the mailing list or bookmark the page -- spread the word, whatever it takes. I know it's difficult to put your trust in a random internet stranger with not much post history. But there are people who will vouch for me on this, and if you can't trust me -- trust them (I'm sure they will chime in). If we don't get sufficient steam built up before something happens, we may never hit critical mass, and at almost 40k subs that would be a crying shame.</p>
<p>If you want to support, join the mailing list at nonewnormal.win, post the site in comments. Drop in on the Discord if you want to chat. If this doesn't get known before something happens to the sub it will never have enough users, and we can never know when this will be.</p>
<p>Keep the masks off and the smiles on,</p>
<p>Hank</p></p>

        <p>Signed up. There are a lot more of us out there than it seems. Out of the very small % of the population that actively use reddit, has to be 90+% are the type that unquestionably buy into whatever corporate controlled media tells them. Especially the loudest of them. I think there is a silent majority that are sick of the bullshit, but most people avoid confrontation and are just waiting for their freedoms to be given back.</p>
