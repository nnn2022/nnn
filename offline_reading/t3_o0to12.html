        <p>Just some food for thought. Knowing history that isn’t taught is important. Like- do you know the history of how meat processing came to be? You buy meats from the grocery store, and though it really doesn’t matter- it’s nice to know how things came to be. </p>
<p>Medical History is something I was never taught in public schools- yet we’re required to get vaccines to attend (US K-12). I think we should be more inquisitive, or at least have an understanding of how all the conveniences we enjoy today came to be. What were the trials? What worked, what didn’t?</p>
<p>I wish more info on basic things like that was taught in school.</p>

        <p>They don’t teach these things because they don’t want the public really knowing about the depravities that have occurred within the medical and scientific communities that are so worshiped by many.</p>

        <p>I remember when I was entering jr high school my mom suggested I read a book called “the people’s history”. I never did, and I wish I had cause I’ve had to read into all these things manually. It’s so time consuming. Getting information easily is a hot commodity.</p>
