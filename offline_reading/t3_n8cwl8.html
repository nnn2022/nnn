    <strong>Here's how you know you're getting scammed</strong>
    <p><p>Scientists have had more than a century since the Spanish flu to learn from the evidence and to figure out what we can do to address the next pandemic.</p>
<p>-But they have to make up their minds halfway during the pandemic whether you should wear a mask or not.</p>
<p>-But they're only figuring out now that the virus does't spread through surfaces.</p>
<p>-They can't tell you how the virus spreads, whether it is through aerosols or through droplets.</p>
<p>-They can't tell you whether you're safe outside in the sun or not. They stop you from going to the beach and they stop your kids from going to the playground. And yet the evidence now suggests these are the safest places to be.</p>
<p>-They can't tell you whether you should take Zinc, vitamin D, magnesium, vitamin B12, Vitamin K, Ivermectin, or hydroxycholoroquin, to prevent you from getting infected and/or hospitalized, because there's "insufficient evidence". You know, the sort of question that would have been useful to have an answer to: What sort of low-risk low-cost nutritional interventions are available to us that could help people avoid hospitalization?</p>
<p>-However, there's apparently enough evidence though that shutting down civilization and robbing you of a year of your life works. There's apparently enough evidence that your kids can't go to school.  There's apparently enough evidence that it's unsafe for you to shake hands or hug other people. There's apparently enough evidence to shut down your livelihood if you don't work for academia, the government, the media or a Sillicon Valley tech company. There's apparently enough evidence that you can't attend funerals, weddings or visit your dying relatives.</p>
<p>-And hey, there's apparently sufficient evidence to lock you up in your house in the evening too, like the Nazi's did with the Jews in the second world war before the Holocaust. Nobody ever did a study on this, but that doesn't matter. After all, "every little bit helps". Unless those little bits would mean going on with your life and giving your immune system the nutrients it needs. Because then there's insufficient evidence.</p>
<p>So why is there insufficient evidence? Why haven't these questions been properly studied? Why can't they give you a proper consistent answer on such elementary questions as: "How do viruses spread?"</p>
<p>What have your tax dollars exactly been used for then?</p>
<p>Here's what you have been paying for:</p>
<p>Infecting genetically manipulated humanized mice with SARS:</p>
<p><a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/81/3/1162">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection of Mice Transgenic for the Human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 Virus Receptor</a></p>
<p>Introducing new furin cleavage sites into SARS to increase its infectivity:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uniprot.org/citations/19321428">Activation of the SARS coronavirus spike protein via sequential proteolytic cleavage at two distinct sites.</a></p>
<p>And most importantly, generating new chimeric coronaviruses, that contain the spike protein of a bat coronavirus in a mouse-adapted SARS virus:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4797993/">A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence</a></p>
<p>Because why would you bother trying to answer the most basic elementary questions, when you can spend your days generating new viruses in a lab instead?</p></p>

        <p>It’s a protection racket.</p>
<p>CDC is an outgrowth of Rockefeller’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/history/index.html">MCWA</a> and helps with <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2021/01/25/have-400000-americans-died-of-covid-19/">cooking the books.</a></p>
<p>&rt;”AIDS and SARS are ways for epidemiologists (e.g., the CDC, WHO, etc.) to secure their jobs and continued funding for their agencies. <strong>No new emerging epidemics, maybe no CDC, no WHO,</strong> so we've got an infrastructure that REQUIRES the "discovery" of new, threatening epidemics. And the media pick a new one every year. This year, it's SARS. For the past couple of years, it's been West Nile Virus. Next year it'll be something else.”</p>
<p>&rt;-Dr. Daniel H. Duffy, Sr.</p>
<p><strong>PCR inventor Kary Mullis on HIV/AIDS:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;”They hadn’t had a good plague since polio. Their funding was probably going to be cut back if they didn’t come up with one. The guy that was the head of the CDC, in fact, wrote a memo that had been obtained where he had described this is, “hot stuff!”  You know? Those guys have an agenda which is not what we would like them to have. That we pay for them to take care of our health in some way.”</p>
<p>&rt;”After World War II, diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria or pneumonia no longer triggered mass fatalities in industrialized nations such as affluent America. This became a huge problem for institutions like the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the American epidemic authorities, as redundancy threatened. In 1949, a majority voted to eliminate the CDC completely. Instead of bowing out of a potentially very lucrative industry, the CDC went on an arduous search for viruses.”</p>

        <p>Yeah, but really, no. Not only did THEY know masks &amp; 'sanitation theater' not work, the knowledge was so wide-spread I knew it! Why? Because I could read!!!! I get no points for saying "See? I told ya so!" though. </p>
<p>Doesn't matter, it is all propaganda "big lie" &amp; even if we know it, somehow 'Emergency Orders" can take away everything at the whim of a Governor. </p>
<p>"Our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear - kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor - with the cry of grave national emergency. Always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it."
--General Douglas Macarthur, 1957 </p>
<p>"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free. The truth has been kept from the depth of their minds by masters who rule them with lies. They feed them on falsehoods till wrong looks like right in their eyes."

        <p>Have you honestly been so lucky to have lost no one? To have had no one in your life laid up for weeks as a 'long-hauler'? I've known others that were fine, but I've lost people. I've has desperate medical facilities flipping their lids due to lacking supplies that can't be manufactured fast enough. I don't need a source - I'm one of the people witnessing first hand and I'm so exhausted of the dismissive reactions when even those in administrative roles are beaten down.</p>
