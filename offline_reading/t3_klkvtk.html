    <strong>If things start turning around - How will these authoritarian supporters be looked at by history?</strong>
    <p><p>I honestly believe one of the most threatening things you can say to someone is "History will not be kind to you". The reason for this is because there are so many examples of people doing things out of pure mind control / dictatorship and it is only when looking back that they see how horrible it truly was.</p>
<p>For these shills that constantly try to keep us under the thumb of government to realize that they are the "NaZiS" they call us to be is simply unfathomable to them. It really is. A user on here posted about the need for reeducation camps. Viewing us a subhuman, wishing death. How white people should not be getting the vaccine first. What about banning the non-vaccinated them from public venues, travel? Will the need to wear a mask for those not vaccinated be the JUDE star in the future? Recently there's even been posts on here about the Corona Cult outing businesses that were not abiding by the mandates. Reminds me of <a href="https://www.yadvashem.org/sites/default/files/3116_50.JPG">THIS</a></p>
<p>Any opinions are welcomed. This is something that has fascinated me recently.</p></p>

        <p>What hurt me most about this pandemic wasn’t even the government’s restrictions. I always hated the government, I never expected the government to be on my side</p>
<p>Friends, family, and peers who support this feel forever lost</p>

        <p>That's why they need every country and state to comply, to get rid of comparators... But there were too many and thus the Sweden, Georgia, Switzerland, and South Dakota's happened.  Though they really did quite amazingly well at getting compliance, it's almost admirable, in a disturbing sort of away.</p>

        <p>Who is "history"?  Will <em>we</em> look back at them poorly?  Hopefully.  I know I will, if I'm still around.  But the sheer number of people who scorned freedom fries with me twenty years ago but went whole hog on the Doomer train suggests we're going to witness the same thing again.  I wonder how many of you will be there then, when I've gone from a young, to a middle-aged, to an old man, yelling at clouds.</p>

        <p>Most of things that we know about history are wrong. History has been written from the perception of the winners.</p>
<p>The ancient greeks used to live up until a 100 years. Yet they dont teach that in school.</p>
<p>No vaccines, no pharma, no nothing, just a bunch of good food, a healthy society and sunlight....</p>
<p>Yet history still teaches you how the people of the past were poor ignorant primitives who thought that the thunder was the anger of god, and didn't live up until 30 years of age, and most of those life was spent in wars</p>
<p>.All to make you think and perceive how lucky you are to live in this modern cage of society!</p>
<p>That is complete bullshit. We are but a glimpse of past societies.</p>
<p>Try to make another pythagoras, archimede, plato, copernicus, leonardo da vinci, michelangelo, marco polo, shakespeare, beethoven, mozart, chopin, born in these times. It wont happen, because we are all so dumbed down.</p>
<p>And yet, even michelangelo and leonardo and giotto and all those extremely intelligent men were not free to do what they liked. They were forced by the church to draw angels and bible scenes in their churches.</p>
<p>Imagine what extremely trippy fucked up art they would have produced if they would have been free.</p>
<p>Leonardo had drawn the model of an helicopter in 1400.</p>
<p>Galileo was smeared and insulted and exiliated for discovering that the earth is round and not flat. The church's pardon came after a thousand years.</p>
<p>History repeats. And don't know half a glimpse of how things went. History has been written from the winners' point of view.</p>

        <p>Galileo didn’t discover the earth was round. It was actually kind of common knowledge by then. There’s lots of info out on Galileo and his prosecution, it’s actually more interesting than the round earth Theory</p>

        <p>as for one, i think that the flat earth theory is a psyop to make all the so called 'conspiracy theorists' sound nuts.</p>
<p>in italy we used to have a saying 'he believes that the earth is flat' much much before that the flat earth theory came to the surface, i think it is a 100 year old way of saying to someone that he believes in bullcrap.<br>
so no, i dont buy the flat earth theory.  </p>
<p>but also i didn't know that it was common knowledge before galileo, i will look more into this. <a href="https://thelogicofscience.com/2015/09/21/no-one-thought-galileo-was-crazy-and-everyone-in-columbuss-day-knew-they-earth-was-round/">https://thelogicofscience.com/2015/09/21/no-one-thought-galileo-was-crazy-and-everyone-in-columbuss-day-knew-they-earth-was-round/</a><br>
i was reading this one to check out what you said for myself, and i want to know more.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

        <p>I don’t believe in flat earth theory either haha I’m an aerospace engineer. It’s just that the history around Galileo is a little different than the story most of us believe! :)</p>
