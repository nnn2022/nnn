        <p>When people say it’s not the flu, I point out that the flu has killed 80k people a year, sometimes more. Then they scream, “yes, and this has killed double that!”  Ok, so how much panic do you have every year about the flu? Zero. Two times zero is still zero.</p>

        <p>Sounds like the author isn't accepting the "actual science and truth". It's not just a respiratory illness - it's a blood illness (clotting, etc.) and UK hospital studies show that the risk of stroke or neurological trauma is higher than the risk of death.</p>

        <p>Our understanding of how SARS-Cov-2 works has increased significantly over the past 6 months. Initially we thought it was just a respiratory illness, but the evidence now shows otherwise. Even apparently asymptomatic people suffer organ damage. How long it all lasts is unknown, but there are enough people who still haven't recovered 3-4 months later that I wouldn't want to risk it.</p>

        <p>Doesn't make sense. At first we were only getting tested ONLY if we had severe symptoms because of scarcity, so the asymptomatic wouldnt even know they had it. This was true until about 30 days ago when free testing was widespread. So how can a person who was asymptomatic 3-4 months ago be still suffering in March,  when they werent testing asymptomatic people?</p>

        <p>Sorry, perhaps I wasn't quite clear. There are quite a few cases of people who are symptomatic and are still experiencing those symptoms 3-4 months later.</p>
<p>As for the asymptomatic cases, I do not know how long those with identified organ damage have been tracked to see how long it takes them to heal. Being asymptomatic, though, they probably wouldn't notice anything immediately. It's the longer-term impacts that could be a problem here.</p>

        <p>An asymptomatic person doesn't experience symptoms. A symptomatic one does. In the case of the organ damage, this can be considered both a sign and a symptom depending on whether the person suffering the damage is actually aware of it. It's like if you cut yourself and it doesn't hurt - the physical damage you can see is a sign, but the pain or discomfort is a symptom.</p>

        <p>These articles don’t say what you think they say. For the diamond princess and others, they found 50% of asymptomatic as had GGN on CT scans. But GGN, particularly in the elderly, is common, with even about 50% of apparently healthy young people showing them on a random screening (source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/documents/mc2985-1012-pdf/doc-20079003 ) The articles even conclude as much. GGN is an extremely non-specific diagnostic. </p>
<p>More research is needed but it is absolutely catastrophizing to think c19 is a silent killer. You need to take a deep breath and get off social media.</p>

<p>I clearly can't change your mind and you are ascribing to me a much higher level of stress than I am actually experiecing (I am certainly not "catastrophising", to use your words). It just seems this thread is ignoring solid evidence about the seriousness of COVID-19 and effectively proposing that it is just left to burn through the population, causing millions of deaths.</p>

        <p>There you go again catastrophizing. C19 is not going to kill a million people in any individual country. Right now it is on track to kill about the same number of people who die in car accidents worldwide annually. Ready to shut roads down yet?</p>
<p>In the same time c19 kills a million or so, 80-100 million people would have died from all sorts of other causes. </p>
<p>But you haven’t proven anything about organ damage. You said lungs and the articles you forwarded me to showed 50% had GGN, which is the only noticed lung damage. And yet lung screenings from years prior to c19 showed 50% of people have GGN as a normal symptom of being alive.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 has already killed 139k in the US so far. As I've pointed out elsewhere in this thread, even with a survival rate of 99.5%, that's still 1.6 million Americans who will die of it if it goes through the whole population.</p>
<p>About 1.35 million people die each year in road traffic accidents. COVID-19 is closing in on 600k deaths thus far and most studies I have seen indicate that only around 10-15% of populations have been infected. So your numbers don't add up.</p>
<p>I wish people would stop with the fallacy that just because other things are deadly and we don't attempt to mitigate those (actually, we do attempt to mitigate road deaths, flu deaths, etc.) that we shouldn't attempt to mitigate COVID-19 deaths. It might be an inconsistency, but it's not actually an argument that invalidates the merit of taking action.</p>
<p>As for the organ damage issue, I don't have time right now to dig through all the research and find where I originally read it. Even if I am wrong about asymptomatic cases suffering organ damage, that is still only about 40% of cases. The other 60% do develop symptoms and they can be quite serious.</p>

<p>With what? We have no cure or vaccine and no guarantee one will show up any time soon. Without either we’re just delaying the inevitable, at the expense of educating our children. We’re effectively trading 1 covid death for 5-10 poverty, drug and violence induced deaths later.</p>

        <p>Yes, we have no cure or vaccine. At least some progress is being made on theraputic treatments.</p>

<p>2 wrong assumptions off the bat. No, survival rate is higher than 99,5 and closing to 99,85 more and more.     </p>
<p>Also it's estimated 50-80% of population are innately immune.     </p>
<p>&rt;most studies I have seen indicate that only around 10-15% of populations have been infected. So your numbers don't add up.         </p>
<p>Are these serological studies? Cause 2/3 of the infected don't even develop antibodies cause the disease is that mild. So triple those figures.    </p>
<p>&rt; Even if I am wrong about asymptomatic cases suffering organ damage, that is still only about 40% of cases. The other 60% do develop symptoms and they can be quite serious.         </p>
<p>Asymptomatic are WAY more than 40%. More like 75%.      <br>
And from the other 25%, the vast majority will develop either mild or flu-like symptoms.       </p>
<p>I didn't feel like citing sources cause I'm honestly tired of doing it without anyone bothering to read them. But there are plenty.       </p>
<p>As for the long term damage, that's    <br>
a) temporary like in most pneumonias.   <br>
b) the blood clot thing is concerning indeed but it's a really small minority with previous circulatory issues for the most part. And it's also temporary and treatable with preemptive medicine.    <br>
c) Most of if is in the most severe patients, aka the oldest. I don't think you can really talk about long term damage on a 90 year old.</p>

        <p>1) I would very much like to see the studies that say 50-80% of the population is innately immune. I have not seen that mentioned anywhere so far.</p>
<p>2) From memory, I think they were serological studies. I do not recall if they adjusted for the limited antibody response, though, so I would have to recheck that.</p>
<p>3) I would have to strongly disagree that asymptomatic cases are as high as 75%, though. I have not found a single study that supports that claim. The problem is that many of the studies that show high asymptomatic case numbers never follow the patients up to see if they later develop symptoms (i.e. <a href="https://thorax.bmj.com/content/75/8/693">this Antarctic cruise</a> ). The examples I know of that do show a much low rate (i.e. 17.9% for the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/publication/32183930">Diamond Princess</a> ).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/06/23/864536258/we-still-dont-fully-understand-the-label-asymptomatic">WHO</a> estimated an asymptomatic case rate of 6 to 41% back on the 9th of June. There's also a <a href="https://theconversation.com/infected-with-the-coronavirus-but-not-showing-symptoms-a-physician-answers-5-questions-about-asymptomatic-covid-19-137029">bunch of studies</a> that suggest the asymptomatic rate is somewhere around 30-40%.</p>
<p>4) As for long-term damage, this virus hasn't been around long enough to determine just how long-term it's going to be. So far we know that quite a few examples of young, healthy people <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-19/the-coronavirus-patients-stuck-in-medical-purgatory/12455364">still sufferring months later</a>.</p>
<p>You are quite right that the blood clotting is treatable, though, which is where our understanding has improved enough to provide better treatment.</p>

        <p>Thanks, I will have a look at the innate immunity ones.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em>: I find it interesting that the innate immunity percentage seems to be around the likely asymptomatic case rate (40%) and have to wonder if this is the cause.</p>
<p>I find it amusing you cited the 81% from the Antarctic cruise which I had already pointed out wasn't a valid example of the asymptomatic percentage. If you read it, you'll find that that 81% comes from a single point in time after about 8 passengers and crew developed symptoms. The very first symptoms didn't occur until day 3 of the voyage and all the testing was done day 20. So it is highly likely that many of those who were asymptomatic at the time of testing were still in the incubation period. No follow-up was done to see how many of them developed symptoms, so this study cannot be used to support a claim that ~80% of SARS-Cov-2 infections are asymptomatic.</p>
<p>The Lancet article actually explictly states that this was the case with their data and so once again, cannot be used to support the claim of such a high percentage of asymptomatic cases:</p>
<p>&rt;The proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that were asymptomatic ranged from 20% to 88% of the tested population in previous studies. <strong>Given the cross-sectional nature of this analysis we were unable to determine whether any of the asymptomatic individuals went on to develop symptoms. Proportions reported therefore comprise both pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, the BBC article has exactly the same problem - it only shows the number of people without symptoms at the time of testing (78%) and doesn't follow them to see how many later develop symptoms.</p>
<p>In short, none of these references support the high asymptomatic percentage you are claiming. The evidence, to date, indicates a much lower asymptomatic percentage around 30-40%.</p>

        <p>First, the author says it will become a "common cold" (which certainly does not cause strokes or other organ damage) and secondly, we make vaccines for the flu every year to help reduce the risk of the more severe effects of the flu. We don't have a vaccine for SARS-Cov-2 / COVID-19.</p>

        <p>That's why it's a good thing that we have flu vaccines. The death toll would be higher without them.</p>
<p>SARS-Cov-2 has no vaccine at the moment. Even if it is "just a flu" (which the evidence says it is not), then clearly measures are worth taking until a vaccine can be developed.</p>
<p>The US has already had over 139,000 people die from COVID-19 in just the last 6 months and there is no sign of the upward trend stopping anytime soon.</p>
<p>We cannot afford to let SARS-Cov-2 simply burn through the population or millions will die across the globe. Vaccines are critical, as we have no guarantee of naturally-acquired herd immunity (research is still ongoing), so without vaccines to help control it in future, a repeat of this situation could occur again in just a few years' time.</p>
<p>The other thing to keep in mind is that it is easier for people to spread SARS-Cov-2 than the flu because of the longer presymptomatic contagious period (3 days for SARS-Cov-2 vs 1-1.5 day for the flu) and the higher asymptomatic case rate (estimated at 30-40%). A person who isn't aware they are sick won't necessarily stay at home or keep their distance from other people and the way this virus works means that that the timeframe in which they could unwittingly transfer it is much larger.</p>

        <p>Just completely brainwashed</p>
<ol>
<li>139K died of COVID or WITH COVID?</li>
<li>33K of those came in NYC where they threw people into nursing homes and on vents. We now have a better understanding of how to treat the virus and how to have hospitals prepared. So saying this could happen a few times a year is a stretch. Also, how do we know the virus won’t and hasn’t mutated into an even less deadly strain? </li>
<li>Waiting for a vaccine is unrealistic in the United States idk about elsewhere because I don’t live there but here in the US that cannot happen.</li>
<li>It doesn’t matter about this last part when majority of the people that get this virus do not have severe complications. This effects mostly people with preexisting health conditions and the elderly. You cannot shut down the economy and world and take freedom from people over a virus that has a 99.5% survival rate.</li>

        <p>Really? I'm the one who's brainwashed when you can't even parse my comment properly?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Are those flu numbers you cited FROM or WITH the flu? As far as I am aware, it is a like-for-like comparison.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I agree that our understanding of the virus has improved significantly, as has treatment. However, we're now at the point (at least in Australia) where medical staff are starting to be fatigued and drop out due to catching it themselves, meaning they are unavailable for 3-4 weeks at minimum. I hear the situation in the US is worse.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn't say "a few times a year". I said "in just a few years' time".</p>
<p>Relying on it to mutate into a less deadly strain is a big "if". Please go read up on all the genetic research. This virus has been mutating quite slowly in contrast to other viruses such as the flu (this is an advantage for vaccines). NONE of the existing variants are worthy of the medical definition of a new strain and there is no evidence that any of them are less severe yet.</p>
<p>3). It's not unrealistic, but the US is mismanaging the pandemic so badly it's not funny. If it had been managed properly from the start, it would have been much easier to wait for a vaccine. Sadly, now the US is in a terrible state and is one of the top countries with COVID-19 cases and deaths.</p>
<p>4). There is so much wrong with this statement. Firstly, the survival rate is dependent on the available healthcare. Here in Australia, where our system has not been overloaded and cases kept low (we are one of the leading countries with regards to testing, so it is arguable that we have detected the vast majority of cases up until the outbreak over the last month), we were still experiencing a CFR of 1.3%. As demand on healthcare goes up, so does the CFR. You also have to factor in all the indirect deaths due to people not seeking medical care due to the pandemic or those who are unable to. So your survival rate of 99.5% is really a "best case scenario" and many countries are not achieving that.</p>
<p>Secondly, whilst it does affect the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, you've got to realise that that is HUGE number of people. In Australia about 16% of the population falls into the high-risk 65+ age bracket. That's 4 million people. Most of those will require hospital care if they get this. How do you propose to ensure that that care is available?</p>
<p>At the rate the case load is increasing in the US, you cannot hope to ensure that the at-risk group receives adequate medical care (especially when some ethnic groups suffer it worse and have less access to healthcare there). Plus your crippled healthcare system means that a lot of people cannot even afford to get healthcare. So there is no way known that the US is going to see a 99.5% survival rate (oh, even with a 99.5% survival rate, that's still 1.6 MILLION DEATHS in the US alone).</p>
<p>That doesn't even consider how many people will be recovering for weeks or months. Those who are symptomatic are sick for 2+ weeks, often 3 to 4. Then there's a percentage that will be unable to work for months (so far we have examples of 3-4 months). And we still don't know how long the lung damage or other damage will last, either.</p>
<p>Are you prepared to condemn over a million of your fellow countrymen to death for your "freedom"?</p>

<p>You’re right it’s all just an estimate. That’s why I grabbed what the CDC is estimating for flu seasons just like you grabbed what the CDC is estimating for rona.</p>

<p>No situation in hospitals are not terrible in US. The hospitals are just fine other than some panic porn in media. I never said the virus will mutate I said it could.</p>

<li>
<p>Yes it is unrealistic. You don’t even live in the US so why are you commenting on how they are handling it. It’s an election year thus that’s why it’s being overblown.</p>

<p>IFR is what I’m talking about. Not every country is testing asymptotic people like the US. There’s a reason we have the most cases. It’s manufactured tests.</p>

        <p>Manufactured tests? Wow, you have gone full conspiracy.</p>
<p>2) Yes, but you can't rely on that "could". You have to prepare for the possibility that it won't.</p>
<p>4) As I said, Australia has one of the top test rates per capita in the world. We have done a lot of random tests (and then tested full surburbs with the recent outbreak), so I would say our data is pretty accurate and it does not support a low IFR like you're talking about.</p>

        <p>Sure, Australia's population is smaller, but it's big enough to gain meaningful statistics and use those to make decisions.</p>
<p>Even if we take an IFR of 0.5 to 0.8% as accurate, that's still a lot of people, as I previously said, and keeping it low depends on provision of healthcare. How many fatalities do you consider acceptable and how do you propose to ensure that those who need healthcare get it in order to keep the IFR low?</p>

        <p>Well here in the US the CDC was estimating 0.26%. I don’t even think 0.5% is worthy of locking down the entire world. You’re then talking about a bigger problem where the lockdown is killing people with depression, cancer and other illnesses that can’t get treatment. That’s already become a major problem in our country. And let’s get that straight that’s not from the virus, that’s from the lockdown.</p>

        <p>Those same people won't be able to get healthcare for depression, cancer or other illness if they're (1) afraid of catching COVID-19 because it's so prevalent or (2) the hospitals are full with COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>I think fundamentally we are going to disagree on this. Clearly I have a lower threshold for an acceptable number of deaths than you.</p>

        <p>&rt;That's why it's a good thing that we have flu vaccines. The death toll would be higher without them.</p>
<p>Which only reduces deaths by around <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/resource-center/freeresources/graphics/infographic-averted-17-18.htm">10% according to the CDC</a>. It seems we've simply learned to live with and accept the flu virus, as we should with this one too.</p>

        <p>What that says is that even preventing 10% of possible deaths is worth investing money and time each year for flu vaccines.</p>
<p>In the US, COVID-19 has already killed far more this year than the flu does in an annual season, so I have to disagree with you that we should learn "to live with and accept" it.</p>

        <p>&rt;First, the author says it will become a "common cold" (which certainly does not cause strokes or other organ damage)</p>
<p>What are you basing that off of? Colds are certainly associated with increased risk of stroke. Here's a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/67/1/8/4791948">study linking rhinoviruses</a> (i.e. common colds) to increased stroke risk in the elderly. There's even a statistically significant <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/common-cold-flu-can-increase-risk-of-stroke-in-kids/">association between colds and elevated risk for strokes in children.</a></p>

        <p>That's very interesting -thanks for the links. I stand corrected and clearly wasn't aware of this. </p>
<p>Based on the study you linked, it looks like the risk of stroke from colds (i.e. rhinovirus or adenovirus) are lower than that from COVID-19.</p>
