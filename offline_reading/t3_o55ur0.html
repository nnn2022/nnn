        <p>It’s true. Armies of psychiatrists,psychologists and other scientists of the mind have sold their souls to big government and big business.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the common people get a prescription and are sent home. Such a waste...</p>

        <p>And it is funny how in school these biases, fallacies and ways to manipulate people aren't even talked about. Kind of like the school system would be more about indoctrination into the system then empowering free thinking.</p>

        <p>My left-leaning high school education included a class that extensively covered these types of biases. And yet here I am a lib, precisely because of that. It’s fairly telling that you’re admitting your own experience in education didn’t teach you to recognize biases. </p>
<p>I don’t know you, but from your post history it seems like you didn’t learn them early enough in life and therefore already had a fully formed worldview by the time you did. Now you look like you’re grasping at any fallacies that might be twisted to support your existing opinions to create a post-hoc justification for your beliefs. All the while making much more basic fallacious missteps yourself (strawmanning “the left”; setting the acceptable goalpost for proof ridiculously lower— or even accepting anecdotal evidence—for conspiracy theories than for agreed-upon scientific consensus. I mean seriously if you accepted the same amount of corroborating evidence for safe and effective covid vaccines as you did for any of your conspiracy theories, you’d have gotten your shot months ago.) </p>
<p>I know one comment has next to no chance of changing your mind, and I’m certainly in the wrong sub to be garnering any goodwill, but I’d still encourage you to thoughtfully consider what I’ve wrote.</p>

        <p>Your thesis isn't build on an argument but on mere claim by nature.</p>
<p>Like assuming you mean the vaccine skepticism alone and not the other conspiracies I also entertain in my mind, your thesis seems to be that <strong><em>COVID vaccine is safe</em></strong> and that <strong><em>you are using a double standard when evaluating the evidence for its safety</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The answer to this is that I'm not using a double standard. If the things which are true for the vaccine would be true for anything else, I would have the same opinion about it.</p>
<p>Lets now thing the vaccine would be an eatable medication for example. The facts about it are still the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>No long term studies</li>
<li>New kind of experimental medication which seems to do weird and new things in your body on DNA level.</li>
<li>Concerning reports on its effect on the heart</li>
<li>Concerning reports in the VAERS on deaths caused by it</li>
<li>Las time they did something similar with the swine flu some people got permanent brain damage from it, which was super hard to get them to admit even though the evidence for it was obvious.</li>
<li>The corporation making the medication have been exempted from responsibility if it does cause harm to me.</li>
<li>I personally am in no real risk of this decease and most likely I have had the virus already since this has been going on so long, and since I haven't died from it, it means I must have a strong enough immunity to handle it, which has already rendered me immune for getting it anymore.</li>
<li>There does exist a real and well planned plan for depopulation so it isn't a stretch to think this would be about that, when the most likely explanation for the virus is that is was purposefully engineered and just "escaped", which also was tried to cover up by the same people who were the most vocal about how horrible the virus is.Like one doesn't need to be a conspiracy nut to see that there is something odd in this picture. The same people who were more keen on taking your rights away because this was so horrible were the same people who tried to cover up that it was human engineered as if that wouldn't be important info.</li>
<li>The governments are trying to violate human rights by appealing to this, hence making this also a human right issue and not just a medical issue. Like I would get if someone would want me to eat some medication because they think it is good for me - we could have a conversation about that, but when you couple that with the attitude that "or else you never see freedom again", then things become different and it is an instant "shove it up your ass" from me.Like if your argument and scientific case isn't strong enough so that you can't convince me with reason then you taking the "I will take your rights then" rout will definitely make me your enemy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like all of this considered, I think my skepticism is well justified and also I have shown that what I'm doing regarding the vaccine doesn't commit the double standard, becasue like anything I'm skeptical about, similarly with this, I have evidence for being skeptical.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming I know the vaccine would do harm to me if I would take it, just that my skepticism is based on reasons which I can articulate and not on physiological conditioning which I would be consciously unaware of, which was your thesis.</p>

        <p>"thesis" lmao this guy thinks he is sooooo smart! first off we gotta talk about your 5g beliefs. you think radiation from 5g is whats making people sick not the virus LMAO. man that is the stupidest shit ever. not to mention most the points you made in this post are just wrong. not sure you understand virology if you think you are immune bc you have a good immune system. the virus mutates and an overactive immune response is usually what eneds up killing people from covid. </p>
<p>also mrna vaccines have been in trial for years and this one was fastracked using data from old studies. also this whole depopulation and takin muh freedom away consiparicies are just not true. please enlighten me on the well planned plan for depopulation, that YOU an average joe is totally in on. imagine a secret conspiracy to depopulate the earth, and kevin over here knows all about it LMAO. </p>
<p>you still have your freedoms all you gotta do is wear a little piece of cloth over your face cry about it you pussy</p>

        <p>it is also called "telling what you believe". Usually people start conversations like that, and then if someone disagrees they start to compare evidences. You are just misunderstanding context if you think my every comment should be a thesis</p>

        <p>Not misunderstanding the context, no one is asking for a thesis. You said these are facts and that you have evidence. Instead you presented your beliefs as facts, which is fundamentally incorrect to approach any conversation that way if you’re just “telling what you believe.” That’s just short hand for intellectually unprepared to defend my stance with zero evidence other than anecdotes. Then provide not a single shred of evidence. You’re spending too much time trying to sound smart than actually being smart and even giving this a fraction of a thought.</p>

        <p>what you show as claims were the arguments. The things I said, to which you refer as claims, were the arguments against the thesis made against me, according to which my <em>skepticism is unreasonable.</em> </p>
<p>The things listed are evidence against this thesis and hence they are evidence. What you are now saying is that I didn't provide evidence for my evidence and hence I didn't provide evidence, but this isn't how the word evidence is used. </p>

        <p>I’m wondering if your depopulation point is based on Bill Gates’ statement. He said that we can lower the population through vaccination and quality healthcare, but conspiracy theorists constantly misinterpret what he meant by that and don’t listen to the rest of his argument. His argument is that by lowering child mortality parents no longer need to pump out 10 children to ensure that some of them survive. </p>
<p>Returning to your points on the vaccine, i’d like to first point out that by saying it “seems to do weird things in your body on DNA level” you obviously haven’t read the literature on what mrna vaccines do, and I’d encourage you to do so. (Yes it puts foreign generic material into your body. but guess what, you do that every time you eat a fruit, vegetable, or meat. It literally can’t change your genes) you seem to be keen on the Freedom vs Safety choice. I wanted the freedom to interact with many friends again without the concern of potentially endangering them so I accepted the theoretical possibility of a vaccine injury to be able to do so. I was comfortable doing this because the risk of serious side effects from the vaccine has been repeatedly, statistically, and clinically shown to be far lower than the risk of permanent complications or death from the virus. Consider that by not taking the vaccine you are also making a choice, one that by all reasonable metrics leaves you open to more harm that the one-in-millions chance of vaccine injury.   </p>
<p>On VAERS, it is a site made by the department of Health and Human Services to track significant trends in vaccine adverse effects. It is only supposed to be used as a first signal that there may be a trend that then needs to be investigated. J&amp;J found a tiny chance of blood clots and temporarily pulled the vaccine, thats how careful they’re being. They then actually researched whether that is a significant risk. We should also remember that VAERS is an open forum not a verified list, and that correlation does not equal causation (a certain number of people were going to get those adverse effects whether or not they got vaccinated, and we can’t attribute them to the vaxx just because they happened after.) </p>
<p>Your idea of skepticism seems to be that all ideas are worthy of being entertained. But that makes you treat all as equal, greatly overvaluing the ones with less supporting evidence. I do not think, as you implied i do, that you don’t have reasons to avoid the vaccine. I am just countering by saying that those reasons are far insufficient to outweigh the reasons <em>to</em> get it.   </p>
<p>Now if you stick by your philosophy and critically entertain any ideas. Think about this one, you might find it intriguingly conspiratorial: there’s an old adage in politics that goes “when you have the facts on your side, pound the facts; when you have the law on your side, pound the law; when you have neither, pound the table.” Conservative media knows it doesn’t have the facts, and that if all people voted in their best interests they would lose. Their policies benefit a rich few, so what do they do to win over a larger segment of the population? Gin up anger, repeatedly pound false or misleading claims until they’re so stuck in their followers’ minds that no reason will pull them out of it. And principally in the playbook is distancing themselves from the enemy. Whatever view the left takes, the right must take the opposite, because if their supporters ever side with the left on a single issue, then they’re one step closer to converting. </p>
<p>This is how we end up with people on the right defending Kyle Rittenhouse, or Jan 6, or most relevantly Covid preventative measures. Is this true? Sure seems like it, but I’m just asking the question.</p>

        <p>This is exactly true. Humans are very strange indeed . The aliens must be flabbergasted at this ability of ours to blatantly ignore the gods honest truth that stares us in the face. But we ignore it because we also have to conform to the group think lest we be culled from the herd.</p>
