    <strong>I'm not anti vax</strong>
    <p><p>It raises big red flags for me that they label you as anti-vax for having even the slightest degree of skepticism of any vaccine. </p>
<p>I'm not anti-vax. I've even worked to promote the rabies vaccine! If I got bit by a rabid animal, damn straight I'd be on my way to a hospital to get my rabies vaccine. </p>
<p>The difference between rabies and Covid is that rabies has a 99% fatality rate and the vaccine has a 99% survival rate. </p>
<p>You don't need a media propaganda machine or censorship when it comes to the rabies vaccine. You don't need to lie and say there is no side effects. The side effects suck massively, but the alternative is near-certain death if you have bit by a rabid animal! </p>
<p>Covid on the other hand has a 99% survival rate. </p>
<p>Let's also not forget that in early 2020 there were various therapies proposed for Covid, but they were shunned by the media because "they are not FDA approved for treatment of Covid-19." They said that despite overwhelming evidence that they ARE effective. </p>
<p>Now we've come full circle and the media propaganda machine is running, this time in an attempt to brainwash everyone into taking the Covid-19 vaccine, and guilt-trip anyone that is slightly skeptical, despite none of the vaccines being FDA approved. </p>
<p>Sorry, but I refuse to take any vaccine that is not FDA approved. </p>
<p>I also refuse to take any vaccine for Covid-19. I believe that I already had Covid (will get an anti-bodies test to confirm later), but also in my health &amp; age group I have a 99.99% chance of survival. </p>
<p>What are the benefits to taking something made by humans in labs when I have a 9,999/10,000 chance of survival? It's probably even HIGHER because the stats don't account for health, just age groups. </p>
<p>If your "sCIenCe" is so weak that one can't make a reasonable counter-argument or even be skeptical without massive shaving, labeling, and media campaigns to place you into the anti-vax group, then maybe your magical "Science" isn't actually scientific? </p>
<p>I don't need to censor my opponents. I reviewed the data and choose to make an educated choice for my health and life. What does any of that have to do with YOU? </p>
<p>Furthermore, the intensive media fear-mongering and propaganda has encouraged me to become even <em>more</em> skeptical of other vaccines and situations. Were vaccines really as safe as I thought before? Or was that a lie brainwashed via repetition into my skull by the government &amp; media? </p>
<p>If the CIA declassified files have taught us anything, it's that the government and authority is completely NON-deserving of our absolute trust and faith. They have failed us time and time again, and that is why they seek to censor &amp; shame - they can't win on logic.</p></p>

        <p>This. My parents never got their follow-ups for measles or hepatitis. They also never got a flu shot or a tetanus booster. But now they ran as quick as they could to the vaccination center to get their experimental gene therapy. But apparently, I am the anti-vaxxer now, although I got all standard vaccines and follow-ups. The propaganda was really strong with this Covid hoax and it made me doubt the necessity of all other vaccines. One thing I always declined was the HPV vaccine. I was old enough then to my own research and this one was the perfect example of medical corruption.</p>

        <p>I'll have to do a little more research on gardasil.
As with any vaccine &amp; as I stated in my OP, Previous to the pandemic &amp; the covid vaccine, I had no problems with the majority or vaccines but as with constant media coverage, There has been this divisive discussion between those of whom that are avid vaccination patients &amp; those of whom that are skeptical of some, If not all vaccines. Going back to the media, It has increased my skepticism of all prior vaccines due to all vaxxers going ballistic at the mere mention of a possibility of the vaccine causing strokes, heart attacks, infertility... etc. 
It is as if the counter-argument could unveil a possible nefarious agenda that has been going on all along. 
With all vaccines.</p>
<p>As for the gardasil vaccine, I have only done research on all vaccines as a whole after all this nonsense has been going down &amp; my research tells me that the common denominator is that there are particular vaccines that it would be a life or death situation which we all can agree are necessary, Those being antivenom also known as antivenin, antivenom immunoglobulin, is a specific treatment for envenomation &amp; again my studies on the rabies vaccine have led to the obvious conclusion that it would be a life or death situation without. 
This all plays into vaccines as a whole.</p>
<p>Then again, There are a list of vaccines where the alternative is taking a natural approach, Our bodies are created to endure (Not all) but a wide variety of illnesses &amp; diseases that believe it or not, You can cure through diet, sleep, vitamins &amp; nutrients. A brilliant doctor known as Mark Hyman has a full book talking about this very thing, How conventional medicine &amp; pharmaceuticals will not endorse methods of care that entail a natural means of recovery "Because" A cured patient is a lost customer.
That is where, Again my skepticism of vaccines come in.
Could they be secretly hiding unknown substances within these shots? Maybe but my sincere disdain comes from a lack of acknowledgment that you can be cured through practical means, anything naturally healthy.</p>
<p>So yes, I would indeed say the media corruption plays into practically anything &amp; everything, If you can indoctrinate the populis to believe your narrative, You can therefore control what's "Good &amp; evil" &amp; what is "The right &amp; wrong" choice. 
My logical answer is that the powers that be are orchestrating control through these tactics &amp; I know for a fact, It is a cover up on what's really going on within the places where they manufacture &amp; create various vaccines.
Hope this sheds a little light on my outlook.</p>

        <p>I don't personally disclose whether I've had any of the Wuhan coronavirus vaccines because a)I consider it to be private medical information; and b)I am opposed to any kind of coercion when it comes to health decisions, and I don't want to do anything that would serve to legitimize denying services or rights to people who take a certain health decision.</p>
<p>For the reason of my simply saying that I prefer not to share that information, I have been called an "anti-vaxxer." That's bizarre to me, because just the other month my health care provider (and I live under socialized medicine) would not give my two-month-old his MMR shots as scheduled, because my jurisdiction was under a "stay at home order."</p>
<p>So now anyone who dares to call me an "anti-vaxxer" gets an earful about how it's in fact my provincial government who are anti vaccines.</p>

        <p>Vax went from science to maffia quackery. The only reason we need it at this point is because they won't let us go. They would literally engineer new viruses and set them loose to sell the new cure, if they haven't already. I am certain that we in reality do not need any of the vaccines pushed on us, there are more than enough other and more natural measures to counter sickness and improve our health.</p>
<p>The red flags and labelling means there is a propaganda campaign going on. It is exactly the same game being played as with labelling people pointing out the truth as conspiracy theorists. No the earth is not flat. No, taking supplements will not cure cancer. Yes there are forces abusing their positions to keep us under control and vax is likely one of their control measures. At best they are making huge profits off us selling snake oil, at worst they are culling us and enforcing survival of the fittest the modern way.</p>
<p>Not only do we not need vaccines from an evolutionary point of view, having diseases naturally thin the herd now and then ensures nature stays in balance. We are destroying ourselves and our environment by hacking our bodies and and hacking nature. Let the old people die and let the young live. Stop forcing us into unnatural lifestyles piled up in cities.</p>
<p>We are human, we are free, we are not the elite's lfestock, we will not be experimented upon.
From now on I consider myself antivax. Thinking that we need to be injected from cradle to grave to survive as a species is the dumbest thing ever.</p>

        <p>&rt; there are more then enough natural measures to counter sickness and improve health. </p>
<p>Right on! </p>
<p>I always talk about how bacteria and viruses in our body outnumber or human cells 10 to 1! </p>
<p>And My biggest problem is the constant 99.9% kill everything now with sanitizer, pesticides, antibiotics. </p>
<p>Then the very narrow variety of food people eat that populate even a more narrow variety of bacteria and we have low diversity and ability to adapt to change in the environments without the use of technology. </p>
<p>Technology and natural ecosystems have to work together to improve one another.</p>

<p>Yes, this is outrageous. But that's what you get from people who control language in order to control the people.</p>
<p>Truth is, the fear, propaganda, censorship, and silencing of scientists, medical workers, and doctors all over the world who try to speak out is enough to disqualify the other side from any debate.</p>

        <p><strong>Indeed, you have caught them in a logical trap.</strong></p>

        <p>Beautifully said üôè The thing is, If everyone or (the majority) become fully vaccinated, (This isn't directed at you by the way but at what "they" would say) Why are you worried? If your vaccine is some magic serum that works as well as you say? Why should you worry if I decide NOT to get it.
