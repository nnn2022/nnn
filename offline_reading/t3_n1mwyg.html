        <p>He lost me at "asymptomatic carriers". He also owns a company that is producing a different kind of "vaccine", so he's kinda motivated to create fear of the current type of biological agent.</p>
<p>From his  Linkedin profile:</p>
<p>&rt;I founded Univac as [<em>sic</em>] inventor of a new  vaccine technology which I subsequently further developed as CSO of the  Company. The technology enables the development of universal vaccines  educating the host immune system to redirect immune targeting away from  canonical antigens to a widely divergent spectrum of vitally vulnerable  pathogen-derived ‘self-mimicking’ antigens, irrespective of MHC  polymorphism. Although ‘non-self’ and exposed on the surface of infected  or pathologically altered cells, these antigens are not effectively  recognised upon natural infection or disease.<br>
 This new type of vaccines harnesses the power of the immune system by  unlocking the untapped potential of self-centered Natural Killer (NK)  cells capable of recognising these unconventional antigens. The  resulting type of immune response is unprecedented and licenses the host  immune system to readily eliminate infection or to cure disease across a  broad range of unrelated pathogens and/ or mammalian species. This  sharply contrasts with conventional targeting of natural immune  responses as induced by conventional vaccines.<br>
 Because of their fast (NK cells) and universally protective effect,  Univac vaccines are uniquely suited to prevent pathogenic agents from  escaping host immune responses as of an early stage of infection or  immune-mediated disease. The technology obviates the need for  traditional adjuvants, multiple boost injections or expensive  manufacturing processes and is readily compatible with intradermal or  mucosal administration. Hence, it also offers unprecedented advantages  in terms of safety, convenience and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>I'm absolutely against mass injection of an untested unsafe biological agent! </p>
<p>But he seems like another grifter, pretending like asymptomatic transmission and aggressive mutations of a slow-mutating virus will be the end of the world unless... </p>
<p>we buy his product!</p>

        <p>You're far too cynical. This is what a whistleblower looks like in real life: Someone from inside the belly of the beast, who sees something that's so wrong that he feels forced to speak out. This man worked at the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, but by speaking out against the vaccines his career is now basically over.</p>
<p>There's nothing intrinsically wrong with vaccination itself. However, new vaccines have a long approval process for a reason and vaccinating people against a mutating virus in the middle of a global pandemic comes with complexities and potential risks of its own.</p>
<p>Geert is not alone by the way, other immunologists have also been working on different kinds of vaccines, because this sort of vaccine does not work in the long run at a population level to reduce deaths, it merely seems to make things worse.</p>

        <p>He was working as a veterinarian for quite a while there before coming out with this stuff. I'm not saying that's a bad thing! But he's hardly sacrificing a prestigious career like a noble whistleblower from within the belly of the beast. </p>
<p>I <em>wanted</em> to believe him! I am just compelled to look at things from different angles, and in his case, I think his motives are not what he says they are. In this scaremongering video he says it's his "last video"- why would he say that? If he's that concerned about "leaky" vaxxes, and is so willing to go against the prevalent narrative... why is he going to stop now? And why doesn't he say why it will be his "last" video? Something's just off here.</p>
<p>Yes, he was on the payroll of the Gates foundation. Who of course would have no investment whatsoever in fearmongering around covid1984 vaxxes. And who of course could never contact a veterinarian who used to work for them to get him out there as controlled opposition by dangling the carrot of his own vaxx company making profits in the future. That would never, ever happen. Right?</p>
<p>I'm cynical in some ways, yes, because there are a fuckton of liars out there. I look into people's motives before I believe them.</p>
<p>And there is indeed a lot wrong with vaxxination itself, but if you think shooting mercury and aluminum into your body is a great idea, then maybe you would benefit from developing a little more cynicism about big pharma?</p>
