    <p><p>There are people who are, let's say, "pro-vax" but I'm talking about how there are people who just felt like it was best for them or the negative effects (regarding many outcomes) of not getting it were worse than the potential side effects.</p>
<p>I'd say it's best not to be antagonistic towards anyone for many reasons.</p>
<p>Just get over it and we'll see how humanity goes but there's no need for sh*t flinging.</p>
<p>You've chosen which side you want to be on, good for you, but stop chucking sh*t at people on the other side. They made their decision just like you did.</p>
<p>If anything, we should be focussing on people who haven't chosen a side along with helping them make a decision.</p>
<p>And guess what. You being antagonistic isn't helping people choose and it certainly isn't going to make it easy to want to choose your side either even if they were considering it.</p>
<p>There are still so many fence-sitters who cannot be straddling the line anymore.</p>
<p>We need to encourage people to choose which energy and consciousness they want to be in.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean "winning them over" or pushing them in any direction. Just letting those that are still sitting on the fence know that it's time to choose and that by not choosing they are slowing down humanity's evolution and rising concsciousness.</p></p>

        <p>I haven’t personally seen much “shit flinging” from anyone against the vax. Most who are against the vax have legitimate concerns for the health and safety of others and are simply trying to inform others of the potential dangers of this new vaccine. On the other hand, I’ve seen plenty of outright attacks from the pro vax crowd against the hesitant. There are many, many examples of them supporting forced vax, jailing and even suggesting “lining anti vax individuals in front of a trench”. The violence is definitely real and coming from the pro vax side. If you have some examples otherwise, I would love to see them.</p>

        <p>I don’t blame anyone for giving into the propaganda that they needed it. </p>
<p>But if someone tries to relay provably false propaganda towards me (it prevents you from being a carrier!), imma antagonize the shit outta them.</p>

        <p>Seems like most people who aren't getting the vax are fine with others getting it, they just want to be left alone. It's the vaxxed from what I've seen that are calling for medical apartheid, and wishing the unvaxed die. At least that's what it looks like on social media. I still haven't met a person in real life saying that shit.</p>

        <p>I sent a vaxxed friend (used to be very close) a link to Reiner Fuellmich interviewing the patent underwriter who found that Pfizer and friends filed patents well before c19 was "discovered in Wuhan".</p>
<p>He didn't watch the vido but just replied with "it's a load of bollocks, sorry". So I had to set him straight.  </p>
<p>If they reply arrogantly, I set them straight- because they are actually asking for it. They are actually curious but their ego has to re-assert itself with the arrogant answer. </p>
<p>Those who really don't want to know simply don't reply to you. With those, I simply stop mentioning it.</p>

        <p>People who are being inoculated, people who are wearing the masks, or simply just blindly following orders are enabling the nut jobs running the scam. Let us admit to this much. They are the reason why our rights are being stepped on, country being destroyed and children living in a dystopian nightmare. So pardon me if I don't feel much affinity to people enabling the scam.</p>
<p>Now does this mean I am going to get into people's faces who have told me they got vaccinated? No, but I am sure as Hell am not going to feel bad or bat an eye if some one else does! People who have lost their freedoms, jobs, families, livelihoods and property because of, in part, these enablers, I do not think we have any right to say that these people shouldn't be angry.</p>
<p>&rt; Just get over it and we'll see how humanity goes but there's no need for sh*t flinging.</p>
<p>With a straight face, I want you to say "just get over it" to the people that have lost their businesses, jobs, family, friends because of the people enabling the scam. You let us know how that goes!</p>
<p>Lastly, it is not our job to convince any one of anything or win any one over, our job is to present the facts, offer our opinion, and support should they ask for it, that's really it. If they agree with us, fine great, and awesome, we encourage it but after they've done their own research. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make the horse drink it. It is up to the people that come across this sub-reddit to do the thinking for themselves, just as we all have.</p>

        <p>Most of my friends are vaxed, the more indoktrinated ones don't give me a hard time since I have had covid and I am generally smarter than them. We just don't talk about this stuff some of us as a silent agreement and other friends who took the vax said no fucking way I'm gonna take boosters enough is enough but they where cohersed by girlfriends to take it and for the sake of the house peace and so on, or they wanted to travel..   Also some of the more alfa friends are totally scared of being wrong in this issue so they will hang onto their vertigo for a long time, but I am kind and offer a way out</p>
