    <strong>Small Victory in local Gas Station</strong>
    <p><p>I was standing in line, a family of maskers ahead of me and another gentleman. The guy in front of me and myself were not wearing masks (I live in a town in Pennsylvania and it is extremely rare to see any faces) This was only the second time I have seen another person without a mask besides myself in about 6 months... The family ahead of us was a mother, about mid 30's and her 2 daughters. One was maybe 10 and the other much younger and both of them were masked along with the mother. SAD. But the victory was another young guy came into the store with a mask and upon seeing me and the other guy without masks he promptly removed his. He sort of looked down at his phone thereafter. I took it as a sort of defense mechanism as this was probably the first time he wasn't masked in a store and was probably nervous. I should have said something to him but I had a long day so I just hope my example was enough for him to remain brave enough to go through with his transaction without a mask after seeing that I had no problems. And hopefully he will have courage to do the same going forward. I find it so absurd as I type this what a fucking dystopia we now live in, especially here in Pennsylvania. I have been hoping to see more instances like the situation I just described. The group psychology is real and the fact that he saw 2 people without masks must have snapped him out of his mental prison and he removed his mask. We are living in a prison without walls and under constant psychological attack from the masked sheep and their generals in the news media and the medical industrial complex. The citizens are both prisoners as well as the prison guards. We need a prison break! Sorry for ranting and for taking so long to get to the meat of the story. End of a tired rant.</p>
<p>TLDR: Myself and another person were not wearing masks in a gas station and the sight of 2 people maskless abruptly caused a masked person after entering the store to remove their mask. It may sound pathetic but it felt like a victory in this dystopian hellscape that is my Pennsylvania town.</p></p>

        <p>This is great. Seeing other people without masks is what finally got me to stop wearing one, too. </p>
<p>I have hope that this shit ends as soon as the masses stop complying.</p>

        <p>Okay I’m just going to say it. Why do you think the Chinese make them all wear masks and the Middle East and Africa too. This is obviously a power play people. DEATH.DEATHS .Deaths inject me with that  flu and see how you do. They want us scared but I won’t be scared. I’m 6’5 270 pounds and god gives me my faith everyday to be free of this virus. Those pagans won’t be able to snuff out this red white and blue god fearing patriot.</p>

        <p>No where on earth is wearing masks more than a small fraction of 1% of the pop. It is totally a BDSM game the plutocrats want to play with us.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Mask culture in china!" is like .5% of all chinese, if that. Or at least it was until the covid nightmare. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Judging by the pool party photos from Wuhan last summer, they dont mask still.</p>

        <p>This is common, not just with masks; there is some protection/comfort following the crowd.</p>
<p>People will follow leaders, but often won't lead.</p>

        <p>I visited a near by town that doesn't have a mask mandate recently and it was nice seeing the overwehlming majority of people not wearing masks it was like being back home, when things were truly normal.</p>
