        <p>The minute I saw any lockdown protests being called "super spreader events" and either it was shut down and/or had cops arresting people then in the same breath BLM protests are allowed with no issue and all the politicians are like "well, fighting racism is important so we know covid viruses will be understanding and not infect anyone here so carry on, nothing to see here" I realized, this is all bullshit and they are laughing at us because we, the people, are the joke to them. Funny how politicians don't have to follow any rules...except when it's on TV so everyone can see what a good example they're setting. Do as daddy government says, not as they do.</p>

        <p>As soon as they so much as even suggested the muzzles, I thought no way, going to extremes, totally paranoid and that opinion has only deepened with time. As for corona vaccines, I didn't really think about them, until I found out about the reactions and how it's going to be used to force people into compliance, and separate people the same way the muzzles do.</p>

        <p>Masks before they were mandated and vaccines before they existed.
I tended to believed in the Covid-narrative when it still was about China, Italy and Iran.
When it supposedly had reached the place where I live and we got our first lockdown but no-one in my vicinity actually got it and the censorship started is when I stopped believing them. That was in march 2020. Even then people predicted what was gonna happen and were called conspiracy-theorists.
A lot of their predictions already came true. If things that conspiracy-theorists theorise about come true, I'd say that can only mean that there's an actual conspiracy.</p>

        <p>When I saw how microscopically tiny the virus is, and that nothing short of a respirator will stop it, yet they required masks everywhere with no guidance to anyone that 99.9% of the masks they were/are wearing do nothing, yet they’re still required.

        <p>I want to add something very important here, something the media is painting us as that’s just not true. </p>
<p>Those of us that have come to this conclusion did so after a ton of research. We seek out the information the media is censoring, we don’t just buy the product being sold. We use our eyes to observe what’s actually happening around us, we don’t just believe what they tell us. We use our brains and analyze the <em>official data</em> put out by the governments and CDC/WHO et al and see that it does not gel with the words the media is using. I watched the censorship and narrative-steering roll out right here on Reddit, I could barely believe what my eyes were seeing, and that was back at the beginning when I was still in the “we’re all going to die” camp. Videos were coming out of China showing what was really happening there, which was nada. Then China shut down their internet. Then we found out China owns 15% of Reddit. </p>
<p>Let me reiterate- <em>we have a reason for believing what we do.</em></p>
<p>My 90+ grandparents were hospitalized with pneumonia, tested + for covid, and my grandfather died while my grandmother <em>recovered</em> and is back home. My grandfather had comorbidities aside from his age. They were both in the hospital with the exact same thing, yet they kept him isolated. They were married over 70 years, but couldn’t be together in his final moments, and died with only one of their ten children present because one visitor at a time bullshit.</p>
<p>Have you heard of the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/grknlbd">50 Cent Party?</a> Do you have any idea how many bots and shills are employed to steer the narrative across all social media? The bulk of the people you’re talking to are bots. AI. Or they’re real people that get paid to steer the narrative, and when you know what to look for, they stand out like a shiny new penny. You think the majority thinks like you do, and that’s not true. Do you understand that Reddit is a far-left-leaning SM outlet, that there’s an entire sub dedicated to getting this one banned? Don’t we have a right to have a sub of our own to congregate and discuss? So you’re also in an echo chamber that makes it look like your view is the majority when it’s not. What you need to do is reconcile what you’ve seen with your own eyes, what you’ve experienced yourself, with what the media and governments are putting out. They don’t add up. Social media influencers are coming out revealing they were offered large sums of money to push the narrative. There is so much going on right under the surface it would blow your mind. </p>
<p>We see with our eyes that this has never been a real pandemic, but the narrative is we’d all be acting the same way if it was, and that’s the biggest fallacy. I can’t speak for everyone, there are always exceptions, but we also want to avoid unnecessary death (which is why we’re not getting the vaccine).  We’re painted as being callous, hateful people that want to kill others through our refusal to use a mask that does absolutely nothing and has been proven to cause more illness than going maskless, through our refusal to get a vaccine that <em>healthy people are actually dying from.</em> A plethora of vaccines and meds have been instantly pulled from the market when just a handful of people died- this is absolutely unprecedented for this to still be going into people when the adverse reaction numbers are reaching never-seen-before levels. And we know only a fraction of the cases are even being reported because if someone doesn’t die within the first 15 minutes, it’s not being counted. Watch the video on my profile “What the fuuuuuuuuuuck” for more on this. Did you know more people have died from this vaccine than all other vaccine deaths in history? <em>Combined.</em> Yep. And that just in the <em>first few months</em> of rollout. Why are we being painted as crazy conspiracy theorists for seeing this and not wanting to take part? For wanting to stand back and wait a while? Is self-preservation not a thing anymore? Do we not have an intrinsic right to protect ourselves? Why are we painted as hateful people for seeing what’s happening and trying to get <em>you</em> to see and make an informed decision? Nobody- absolutely <em>no-bod-y,</em> knows the long-term affects of these shots. Normal vaccines go through <em>years</em> of trials before they’re out on the market. I know, I know, <em>tHe fLu vAcCiNe tHo.</em> First, the flu vax is only mildly effective. Second, the only thing they change every season is add the dead virus from the previous season (which may or may not even work for the current strain circulating); the rest stays the same. They don’t start from scratch every flu season.</p>
<p>Do you understand what a vaccine is? It’s when a tiny amount of a dead virus is injected so that your body can build up antibodies against it, so that if you are exposed to the virus, your body will be better able to fight it. That’s not what these are, with the exception of the J&amp;J vaccine. Unless you go in educated, it’s a crap shoot which one you’ll get. I am not an anti-vaxxer; vaccines- <em>safe</em> vaccines- have their place. That’s not what we’re talking about here. What’s being learned is that people that had covid and recovered have a very strong natural immunity, just like a real vaccine would work but better, but the ‘vaccine’ is obliterating the immune system. Do you understand what that means? Do you know how the immune system functions? Do you know the consequences of having an immune system that doesn’t work? Find someone with an auto-immune disease and ask them what life is like for them. Why should people be forced to take a shot when they already have natural immunity? Does that seriously make sense to you?</p>
<p>Did you know the first case has been traced back to Wuhan in October of ‘19? Do you know what this means, when nothing was shut down until March of ‘20? It means this has been spreading way before they locked things down, which they only half-ass did anyway. Yes, flights from China were stopped, but you could fly from China to another country where flights weren’t stopped and come right on in. Don’t you think, if it was a real deadly pandemic, <em>all</em> flights would be <em>immediately grounded?</em> I’m in the US, and my city has a very large Chinese student-base at our University that flew home for Christmas and came back. That happened all over. And then there are the business people that fly back and forth on a regular basis. If you think we haven’t all already been exposed, I have a bridge to sell you. I talked to someone who does billing at a med clinic, and she said they completely stopped testing for the flu, everything was covid, which she said doesn’t even make sense because the flu test made them way more money than the covid. My point here is, unless you already have an auto-immune disease, your body most likely already has built up an immunity to covid, because you were exposed before anyone knew it was even happening. </p>
<p>If this was truly a deadly virus, and masks worked, they would not have lifted the mask mandate because <em>a vaccine does not stop you from contracting and spreading a virus</em>. It helps your body fight it- that’s it. “BuT wE hAve tO pRoTeCt tHe vULnEraBLe aNd eLdErLy!!!” Newsflash, the flu, hell, even a cold, <em>acid reflux</em> is just as deadly to those same people. What have we done in the past to protect them? Nothing, besides the obvious- we don’t go around them when we’re sick, and <em>they</em> protect themselves when an illness is circulating. If you are vulnerable, and are at the grocery store during a deadly global pandemic when accommodations are available, that’s on you- that goes right back to self-preservation. Why aren’t we seeing essential workers dropping like flies? Week after week I see the same faces at the stores I frequent. </p>
<p>“bUt ThErE aRe LoNg-tErm eFfEcTs oF cOviD!!!” Oh yeah? How do we know that already? Answer: we don’t. We also don’t know the long-term effects of the vaccine. Why is one a valid argument but not the other? Aren’t they <em>both</em> equally valid questions? Why, if something is soooo deadly, are healthy people being tested for it? If there’s no asymptomatic spread, and you’re not symptomatic, why would you even get tested? Follow the money. Nine new pharmaceutical billionaires were made during this “outbreak”.</p>
<p><a href="https://ncrenegade.com/massive-world-renowned-doctor-blows-lid-off-of-covid-vaccine/">This is an excellent video </a> that is being censored, from an actual medical expert. Ask yourself why social media is censoring testimony from actual experts in the field. Don’t you have a right to hear from all sides so you can make the most informed decision <em>for your life</em>? Why are people deciding for you what you can and can’t hear, by people that have no medical background, only a degree in IT, and that’s a <em>maybe</em>? Why are <em>children</em>, that have been outlawed from drinking and smoking until they’re 21, being allowed to make medical decisions without their parents’ consent for something that nobody knows the long-term effects of? </p>
<p>I need to wrap this up. I hope at the very least this gave you food for thought. We are not evil people, we don’t want to see, at the very least, our families get a shot for something that for most is 99.8% survivable, and extremely treatable with medications that have safely been on the market for decades. We are not denying that covid exists, we just question the reaction to it because it makes no sense when you have all the data in front of you. Best of luck.</p>

WHO,NIH and Faucci flip flopping on masking. What really confirmed the absurdity of wearing masks was when faucci said hook ups were a-ok.</p>

        <p>I doubted the masks because everyone was wearing them as chin diapers or not over there nose and there was no effect on numbers after my city put a mandate in. Also, while wearing a mask I was still able to smell the scented candles at the store from several feet away. If aromatic compounds can make it through the masks, virus particles surely can. I was wearing a high grade surgical mask too.</p>
<p>I doubted the vaccines because they were rushed. Normal drugs and vaccines take years to test for safety and efficacy. I also don't like the idea of turning my own cells into spike protein factories.</p>

        <p>When Fauci said “masks won’t protect you”. If this virus is so deadly why not have a standard of mask. Provide disposables with bio hazardous waste bins everywhere. It was confirmed for me with the amount of bacterial infections going around this year.</p>

I hated them from day one and never bought into any of it. i just don't want the vaccine, i had covid and have antibodies. i'm good and not interested in doing one more thing regarding this virus. it has stolen our lives, i hate it and i am done with it and resent any push to do anything at all</p>

        <p>I don't really care about masks to be honest I would put one on to go into a place that required it not because I was scared or a sheep but simply because it was required. . . Like idk a speed limit or age of consent. </p>
<p>I started doubting masks on day one seeing how difficult it was for others to follow simple directions or wearing masks properly. </p>
<p>And doubted the vaccine after seeing side effects that were not listed, my nursing staff coworkers and friends are dealing with. Mind you they are mostly minor but still it went from there are no negative side effects to even if these are side effects it's still better than getting cov. . . Mind you the majority of them already had covid before getting the mandatory vaccine to keep their job. The majority of these were women as well if that matters at all, it seems to me that plays a part as they seemed to struggle more with the shot. IN MY OPINION.</p>
