    <strong>What is wrong with these doomer city dwellers?</strong>
    <p><p>They act as if everybody in the world shares their exact same lifestyle. It just goes to show how self centered and narcissistic these people really are.</p>
<p>They say things like people opposed to the covid shot/masks are doing so purely for political reasons/Fox News.  This is such a stupid take and really shows how ignorant they are.</p>
<p>I live on the outskirts of a (small, think 50k) city that is run by Democrats.  There is no lockdown. No mask mandates.  Nobody wears masks.  I‚Äôve never once been asked about my vaccination status.  It‚Äôs literally business as usual.  And might I add, NO COVID SPIKES.</p>
<p>Yet on Reddit you have people wishing death upon the non maskers and anti covid shot people.  Saying they are so stupid and selfish and evil. And blaming their actions on a political party/news station.  When everyone where I live, of all walks of life, are carrying on like business as usual.</p>
<p>I get that it might be worse in big cities.  I can understand that.  But they don‚Äôt seem to be able to do the same for those that aren‚Äôt living that lifestyle.</p>
<p>Do these Reddit Doomers think the world revolves around them?  Are they incapable of imagining a world different from their own?  Why do they assume everyone has the exact same circumstances as them?</p>
<p>EDIT: I just looked at the graph for covid in my city. It looks exactly the same as many other graphs of places that had mask mandates and lockdowns.  There‚Äôs a big spike last winter and then it dies down.  Just like you would expect with the common cold.</p></p>

        <p>On the contrary, it makes <em>you</em> better than them and, subconsciously, they know it. </p>
<p>You‚Äôre living life the way humans were intended to live it. You have real skills that apply outside of an extremely complex and fragile market economy. </p>
<p>Most cities have like a week of resources available at any time and most people in those cities have no way to survive beyond that. An ability to reconcile your company‚Äôs income statement doesn‚Äôt go very far if the grocery store shelves are empty.</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs funny because that has been going on since before the civil war.  I don‚Äôt understand why they think they‚Äôre better than people because of where they are from.  While they attack everyone else for discrimination.  But because we are the other to their society we are fair game to be discriminated against.</p>
<p>The hypocrisy is mind blowing and has been going on for hundreds of years.</p>

        <p>Reddit is a propaganda bath house, where Doomers come to get all steamed up by Chinese, Mossad and American counter-intelligence agents posing as "normal people". This place is swarming with Agent Provocateurs and that's one of the characteristics that makes it so darn interesting and fun.</p>
<p>These online demons have no idea regarding the spirits they are calling forth from the people.</p>
<p>Reddit will be a wasteland of defeated people! It's INEVITABLE!</p>
