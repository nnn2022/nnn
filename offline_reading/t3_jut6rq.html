<p>&rt; The deal gives China an important voice in setting standards for regional trade and if Beijing uses that power collaboratively, its soft power will grow. “It’s potentially very good for China,” said Prof Petri.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about China’s connection to coronavirus. I put this in another thread, but it’s applicable here too. Right now there are re-education camps which resemble concentration camps in Xinjiang China and there is evidence that a genocide is taking place against the Uighur people. </p>
<p>&rt; The US State Department estimates that over one million Uyghurs have been detained in a massive network of internment camps in Xinjiang, where they are reportedly "subjected to torture, cruel and inhumane treatment such as physical and sexual abuse, forced labor, and death."</p>

<p>While the level of transparency of China’s coronavirus numbers and goings on at the Wuhan Institute if Virology have yet to be verified, one can certainly verify that companies which largely sell Made In China goods have profited enormously from this pandemic. For example Amazon doubled its net profit year over year to $5.2 billion, compared to $2.6 billion at this time in 2019. In August Target reported the greatest percentage increase in quarterly sales in the company’s history. Walmart reported earnings doubled its e-commerce sales. Home Depot’s sales increased more than 23 percent in this year’s second quarter. Wayfair reported earlier that its revenue was up roughly 80 percent year over year. Try ordering masks in bulk online from one of these stores and odds are, they were made in China.</p>

<p>This needs to stop. China is using concentration camps and trying to become the most powerful country in the world. Sound familiar? This needs to stop, now! The new normal will turn free counties into places like CCP China.</p>
<p>Boycott China!</p></p>
