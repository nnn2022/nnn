    <strong>Pro Lockdown folks have absolutely nothing supporting their claims</strong>
    <p><p>Seriously, let’s just talk about the arguments that most of these people tend to use. They are riddled with logical fallacies and each one of them can be refuted. It’s honestly laughable at how easy it is to shoot down these arguments, but I thought I’d compile a list of the main ones here and why each one is wrong:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lockdowns save lives:</strong> If this were true, then we’d see proof. Countries like Sweden, Belarus, and Nicaragua would be at the very top of the list when it comes to deaths per 100,000. Do we see this? No, absolutely not. Ergo, the argument “it would be worse without a lockdown” is a defeated argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Masks save lives:</strong> This can be refused by the same argument as #1, but there is actually evidence of masks being harmful, which I will discuss in a moment. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Masks are only a minor inconvenience:</strong> Ok, let’s run down the hit list of all the horrible things masks do for our society. They make it difficult to breathe for some folks, they impede communication, they give a false sense of security, they actually make some people more at risk for covid because you touch your face more with a mask on, they are a great way to get gum infections as masks are a perfect environment for bacteria to thrive in, they serve as a daily reminder of the pandemic and make it so that there is no escape from the current situation, and they hurt children’s development by not allowing them to see facial expressions. Also, it can be argued that masks are akin to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law">sumptuary laws</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It’s only until we get a vaccine:</strong> First it was two weeks to flatten the curve. Remember that? When I loan a friend money and they don’t pay me back, I don’t loan them money a second time. Same principle here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You’re being selfish:</strong> This is an ironic one because it is inherently selfish to force others to live according to your terms because you are scared. I’m an academic, which means that the university is kind of like my home away from home. Imagine that you were first told that you couldn’t return home for two weeks, then two months, and eventually you have no idea when you can go back home? How would you feel? Now imagine if you’re told that not only can’t you go home, but you’re <em>selfish</em> for wanting to. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This is a NOVEL virus and a DEADLY pandemic:</strong> The fact that it is a novel virus proves nothing. All viruses are novel when they’re first discovered. As for “deadly,” it really isn’t. Out of 25,000 college students that tested positive, 2 were hospitalised and 0 died. Yeah... real deadly. Also, if the WHO is to be believed, 750,000 million were already infected meaning the virus has a mortality rate of 0.13% which is akin to the  flu. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>We might as well lockdown because it’s better to be safe than sorry:</strong> Except these lockdowns hurt so many people. Over a hundred million people have been pushed into abject poverty from the lockdowns. People lost their jobs and their livelihoods from this. There is a despair amongst so many people right now directly caused by the lockdowns, which lead to PRSD and suicide. So how dare you. If you want to stay at home, feel free. Nobody is stopping you. But don’t you dare condemn others to this hellish lifestyle because you’re erroneously convinced that this is the plague. Don’t be selfish. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You’re stupid so I shouldn’t argue with you:</strong> This is a common logical fallacy. “Person A is a part of group B. Group B are idiots. Therefore, person A must be wrong because he is part of group B.” So many times I have seen trolls here just call people stupid without successfully refuting a single argument. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> It’s funny, I’ve spent 6 months trying to figure out why so many people don’t see how these lockdowns do more harm than good and I think I finally have an answer. People just don’t want to think about it. I mean, I have not found a single good argument in the side of the pro lockdown folks. Now, granted I’m not some all knowing authority, but I find it interesting that I have tried relentlessly to see where the other side is coming from and I just can’t understand. The only conclusion I have left, is that doomers just block out any information they don’t want either by saying that all people who disagree are conspiracy theorists (absolutely untrue), they all support Trump (again, not true, I’m a Lib Dem), they’re all uneducated (I’m in grad school and have done original research), they’re stupid (not even an argument), or they’re misinformed (oh, the irony). Then, there’s probably another group that knows on some level, but won’t admit it or else all this was for nothing. Well, it was. This is the first opinion I’m going to give, but I believe that the lockdowns are the biggest tragedy in human history since WWII. Where else has there been this systematic oppression of people? At least under most fascist dictatorships one might be able to ignore it, but not here. You are forced to be constantly aware of covid all the freaking time and this is what is so disgustingly horrific about this. Like Danton said during the French Revolution, “people just want the terror to end.” Well, this.</p></p>
