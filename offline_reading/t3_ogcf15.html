<title>Redditor links me to a US Census report to try to prove to me that Baby Boomers nearing Life Expectancy can't be a reason for an increase of deaths in 2020. Turns out it helps prove me right.</title>

    <strong>Redditor links me to a US Census report to try to prove to me that Baby Boomers nearing Life Expectancy can't be a reason for an increase of deaths in 2020. Turns out it helps prove me right.</strong>
    <p><p>According to google, The Baby Boomer Generation (born 1946-1964) Make up 21.19% of the population.</p>
<p>As 21.9% of the population nears life expectancy, Death Rates necessarily go up.</p>
<p>I was told this was crazy talk and asked to study figure 2 in this link:</p>
<p>&rt; https://www.census.gov/prod/2014pubs/p25-1141.pdf</p>
<p>You really need to see this link. And also read the description part.</p>
<p>&rt;The baby boom population has
been decreasing since 1999, and
the decline is projected to continue
through 2060 as the baby boom
population enters the older ages and
succumbs to the forces of mortality. When the first baby boomers
turned 65 in 2011, there were just
under 77 million people in this
population. By 2030, when the baby
boomers will be between 66 and 84
years old, that number is projected
to drop to 60 million and decrease
further by 2060 to only 2.4 million.4
The baby boomers who remain in
2060 will be 96 years and older. </p>
<p>If the study says that there were 77 million baby boomers in 2011... and will be 60 million in 2030... that means 17 million people will die between 2011 and 2030... which means an average of 894,736 need to die each year between 2011 and 2030 to have that decrease in population.</p>
<p>Obviously, averages are not straight lines, and the actual toll will be a bell curve, like the link above. But the average helps us set a baseline.</p>
<p>Google also says Population in millions for The Baby Boomer Generation (born 1946-1964) right now in the US is 69.56 million. According to that census link above, we should have had nearly 9 million die off on average, but only had about 7 million deaths from 2011-2021. So the bell curve over the next 9 years to 2030 needs to add in 2 more million from 2011-2021... making the on-average number of Baby Boomer Deaths per year a little over 1 million per year.</p>
<p>According to this link: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1191568/reported-deaths-from-covid-by-age-us/</p>
<p>79.520552336666% of "covid deaths" are in the 65+ age range.</p>
<p>95.308614062853% of "covid deaths" are in the 50+ age range.</p>
<p>When you hear them yelling about an increase of deaths from Covid - Deaths of people who are mostly near Life Expectancy age - remember that they are using correlation to imply causation.</p>
<p>And they are doing this on purpose.</p></p>

        <p>Required Book Report:</p>
<p>"Common Cold!?!?!"</p>
<p>Yes. That's right. The COIVD19 Coronavirus is the Common Cold.</p>
<p>If in 2018 we tested everyone who died to see if they had a coronavirus, and labeled that death as a "Seasonal Flu Death" - even when there were 4 comorbidities like heart attacks or diabetes or car accidents - We'd have the same kind of number toll we have for COVID19 over whatever was the common cold in 2018.</p>
<p>Why didn't we apply the same standards to COVID19 death certificate's before 2020? We had seasonal flus, and tests that could detect coronavirus. Why didn't we test everyone who died and label that death a seasonal flu death?</p>
<p>Because it is kind of an absurd way to do it - that is why. The flu didn't kill them, the heart attack did. The Old Age did. The Diabetes did.</p>

<p>&rt;A 'Universal Vaccine' May Soon Protect Against All Coronaviruses, Including the Common Cold</p>
<p>Do you know why you can't find an article about a Polio vaccine protecting against the common cold? It's because Polio and the Common Cold aren't the same thing. But COVID19 and The Common Cold ARE the same thing.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried to go to a medical dictionary and look up the virus that causes the common cold?</p>
<p>https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/common%20cold
&rt;Cases of regular coronavirus, which causes the common cold, are up, as are human metapneumovirus, which causes cough, fever, nasal congestion and shortness of breath. â€” Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY, 25 May 2021</p>
<p>https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/infections/respiratory-viruses/common-cold#v788445
&rt;Common colds are among the most common illnesses. Many different viruses (rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and human metapneumoviruses) cause colds,</p>
<p>And the side bar also links you to this: https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/infections/respiratory-viruses/coronaviruses-and-acute-respiratory-syndromes-covid-19-mers-and-sars
&rt;There are many different coronaviruses. Most of them cause illness in animals. However, 7 types of coronaviruses are known to cause illness in humans.</p>
<p>&rt;Four of these 7 human coronavirus infections involve mild upper respiratory tract illness that causes symptoms of the common cold.</p>
<p>&rt;However, 3 of the 7 human coronavirus infections can be much more severe and have recently caused major outbreaks of deadly pneumonia</p>
<p>Anyone who says Covid19 is not the "Common Cold" is literally a science denier.</p>
<p>The One World Government Great Reset types are using Hypochondria Fascism to try to destroy the world and rebuild it as they see fit. And to do it, all they needed to do was convince the "Scientists" of the world to panic over the common cold.</p>

        <p>The key word to know here is "Iatrogenesis"</p>
<p>The key action is to keep modern medicine's meat hooks away from yourself.  </p>
<p>These people will statistically die on a predetermined schedule.  It appears that the public is largely ignorant of this demographic death bomb, and could be frightened by it if it were communicated to them in a certain way.  </p>
<p>historically, Iatrogenesis, or medicine-induced-death, is the number three killer in the US, after heart disease and Cancer.  The latest data shows it has taken the top spot.</p>
<p>Let me repeat - death-by-medicine has risen to become the leading cause of death in America.</p>
<p>if you don't take your own health into your hands, it will end up theirs, and they have fucking butterfingers.</p>
