        <p>Great video, though I think Corbett's a bit too dismissive about the influence celebrities have (and thus why WHO and other organizations are using them to push the "New Normal"). Yes, a lot of people don't care about celebrities. Aside from some admiration of their works, I don't care about or follow celebrities myself. However, there are even <em>more</em> people who do, and they spend a good portion of their lives listening to these famous people, and trying to emulate them. I've had friends and social media followers in the past who lived like this, caring deeply about what the likes of, say, Chris Evans or Scarlet Johansson did or said. I found it quite telling that Tom Hanks was one of the first celebrities to get COVID, and to essentially support the lockdowns back in March, people were terrified that he was going to die, and this spooked many into agreeing to extend the "two weeks to flatten the curve" back then as well.</p>

        <p>I find people care about the celebrities they like. So if they target enough theyâ€™ll hit a good audience. Many people care like you said although they may not outwardly talk about it or even know it affects them that much. When Tom Hanks got it people definitely shifted their perception on the virus</p>

        <p>Tom Hanks is one of <em>the</em> most beloved celebrities of this era, most definitely. It was almost a bit too perfect that he was amongst the first to catch it, and also get tested for it. People panicked about his condition. Again, the timing was super perfect because this helped lead to more support for extending the initial lockdowns.</p>
