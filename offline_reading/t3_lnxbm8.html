    <strong>Three things to keep in mind</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>
<p>COVID is not a significant threat for the overwhelming majority of the population. If you are under 70 with no underlying health conditions, you are at extremely low risk from COVID. Some people may catch COVID and may perish. This is also true of the flu, measles, chickenpox, etc... For most people, if they happen to catch COVID, they will get over it. We have immune systems for a reason. Viruses exist and COVID isn't all that special. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various treatments exist if you happen to be in a higher risk group. HCQ + antibiotic + zinc, ivermectin, inhaled budesonide (asthma steroid) have all been shown to reduce mortality. Vitamins D and C are also beneficial in a prophylactic way; keep a strong immune system. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asymptomatic spread has been shown to be false. The original study was in early 2020 and subsequent studies have failed to observe any asymptomatic spread. The most noteworthy of these was published in Nature journal with a sample size of ten million inhabitants of Wuhan, China. If you're not sick, you don't need a mask. (And if you're sick, stay home.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bonus thing to keep in mind.
Governments are absolutely increasing the number of COVID deaths and cases as needed. In most Western nations, the methodology for counting a patient as a COVID death is merely testing positive for COVID. That is, a death WITH COVID is counted as a death FROM COVID.
 Further, many of these same governments are using PCR tests at thresholds known to yield mostly false positive results.</p>
