    <strong>I'm scared about my dad</strong>
    <p><p>So, I had a talk with my dead this morning and he told me that he was scared of getting Covid and die and thus he's decided to go for the jab. </p>
<p>I'm actually pro-vax and have all the needed ones and my dad gets a flu shot every single year. But he's over 60 and really worried about catching it, and I can't really argue with him. He's not super unhealthy but not extremely healthy, either. </p>
<p>Anyway, he's made up his mind and is going to get it. And it might be me being a crying baby or a stupid drama queen but I'm actually really worried about him getting it and him, well, getting sick or dying. I don't know what to do. I told him that these were new methods, and how I was suprised they rushed the trials. He even said, "well, now there's millions testing it". So he heard me loud and clear. He still says he is sure of his decision and he'll get it to be protected.</p>
<p>And I know I have to accept his decision, which I told him, but I'm also just worried. What if something happens? </p>
<p>Or will it even matter because we won't have a normal society anymore anyway? What if this blows over but he is damaged by the jab? And I could've stopped it, maybe, but didn't?</p>
<p>I realize I sound crazy. I just don't know who else to tell.</p></p>

        <p>At the end of the day, he's doing what he feels is right for him and others ought respect his decision.</p>
<p>I figure I'm not the only person scrolling through the home feed reading this and simply thinking to myself - "I hope it goes well for him."</p>
<p>Your concerns are warranted, but we all have a choice to make in this. I wish him and yourself well for having accepted the vaccine(s).</p>
<p>Please don't go thinking less of others that are personally opposed or hesitant pending longer term results.</p>

        <p>Where do you read that I have accepted mine?
I'm not trying to change his mind because he's decided already. </p>
<p>I'm just venting, I guess, because I don't want anything to happen to him. He's my dad. I'm in my 20s and have little risks. He's not so young anymore.</p>

        <p>Oh, I suppose it was an assumption, seeing as you indicated you're pro-vaxx and said you'd gotten the required ones. In further consideration I guess you're talking the MMRs and possibly Tetanus shots.</p>
<p>I totally understand if people are dealing with hesitancy regarding these newer (mRNA) forms of vaccines. I worry greatly what the longer term effects of them may or may not be as it is effectively gene therapy.</p>
<p>The situation is sticky. Your concerns are warranted and may be worth a solid heart to heart with your pops over your concerns for his well-being. At least you would know that you spoke your piece on the matter.</p>

<p>For example in this case even though he’s already decided, do you think you could say “ok well can you at least wait to get it until June 1?” </p>

        <p>I convince him to postpone it until I have a weekend off so I could check in on him. He knows that this is gonna be end of April, beginning of May, though. So time is running out. </p>
<p>Tbh, I was hoping that whatever is cooking rn behind the curtains will blow up before he takes it. J&amp;J put on hold is a huge thing, but let's stop pretending that Moderna and Pfizer are somehow soooo much safer and have no adverse effects. 
If they got put on hold, even only for one day, I bet he'd hesitate.</p>

        <p>J&amp;J and AZ are no classic vaccines. They are vector based. </p>
<p>Classic vaccines is the chinese one, and I think Novavax. Although the last one uses nanolipids and adjuvants so not ideal either.</p>

        <p>Ok cool. Good to know. I was just too lazy to look up the ways in which they differ from mRNA and just called them classic.  I think the real baddy is the mRNA one. I’ll start calling the others vector.</p>

Do you think anything in his lifestyle helped?
My dad loves to garden and is in the sun all the time. I bet he's got killer vitamin D levels.</p>

        <p>A friend of mine who has medical issues and is in his early 60s went for his vaccine a week ago. I’ve not been able to get ahold of him since. I tried to talk him out of the vaccine, but I allow people to make their own mistakes. Hopefully he’s just lost his phone and not replaced it or something, rather than what I suspect, a vaccine injury. Do whatever you can to convince him. Good luck.</p>

<p>they sure got us with this whole world they built but now a lot of people are waking up to how extremely farce it all is. </p>
<p>(i studied geopolitics and followed all the news channels closely and my end result was that none of it made any sense. one day something would happen and we would be enemies with someone then the next day we are allies with them and something else is going on. just total nonsense if you actually read it. i mean even officially we sold weapons to terrorists and funded them and other countries did the same so in real life it's all just an act like iron man 3 lol)</p>

        <p>There's little you can do, really. Show him the information that backs up your concerns, and make sure he knows how you feel, but you'll just have to leave him beyond that. At the end of the day, it's his decision and if something happens to him that's not your fault and you've done what you could to stop it. I understand your worries, my grandad got his second dose on Wednesday and we were all worried, especially when he was running late getting home, but he's doing just fine now. If he respects your decision not to get it (I assume from what you wrote that you aren't), then you must also respect his, and I know you know that.</p>

        <p>And I am the president of the United States. Here's my badge.</p>
<p>Reports right now that the vaccines are injuring/killing people are simply that, reports. No confirmation between the vaccine and these reports. If you look at VAERS data it warns you of this.</p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> a respiratory therapist, you should at least understand that vaccines aren't 100% effective, right? There's even a family from Florida who were all vaccinated and ended up contracting the virus after the two week period (don't know if it was a variant or not, it wasn't covered in the news story).</p>

        <p>Not 100% effective. Look at the Cochrane review on the flu vax. Totally useless. This vax is the same. Useless and harmful. You can spend time trying to convince me otherwise, but I have done the research and it was convincing. You should definitely take this vaccine. Shit, take all 3. That'd be even better. And then, in a few months, don't forget your booster because the first series was ineffective. And again 3 months later and so on until everyone is a fucking degenerate.</p>

        <p>If he did get covid, though. He lives in a remote area, only has me (I get tested before I go to him. Yeah, I know you guys hate it but I do it for him) getting him groceries. Rarely goes outside/where other people are because he just stays in the garden. So I just wish this whole pandemic could've passed him by.</p>

        <p>Nothing wrong about getting tested before seeing him, it shows that you care more about his health than being political like many people here are. Right now he would have no risk of getting the coronavirus based on what you are telling me. I would say whenever he starts to go out again would be when he should get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>He doesn't plan on going anywhere, but he is scared and so he will get it to sit at home. And as he lives alone, if he did get a reaction, nobody would be there to help him. 
I live some 2 hours away from him</p>
