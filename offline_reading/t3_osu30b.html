He's like a mosquito, he just has zero redeeming features... he'd literally be doing the world a favour by just going away forever.

<p>It's not just going to disappear into thin air to never been seen again. What's their end game here exactly? We have gone through surges just for it to calm down again, we now have vaccines, it's been almost 2 years.... what the hell more do they intend to do?</p>

        <p>It is all about testing.  Don’t count nor test for breakthroughs that don’t require hospitalization.  When someone dies from the vaccine, don’t count it, they had pre-existing conditions.  If new cases are low, more testing is the answer.  If there are new cases, it must be due to anti-vaxxers, even when in most places they aren’t testing which variant it is.  Even when vaxxers can catch it and spread it to other (gasp) vaxxers.
How the bloody hell could you possibly know what worked if the entire thing is setup in such a way to confuse the results???
It is like some mad scientist running an experiment changing four variables at a time, keeping nothing constant, and trying to derive some meaningful conclusion from it all.  It is a complete joke.</p>

        <p>Well because there are tests for it and after doing those PCR testing the doctors confirmed it was B.1.617.2.....the rapid tests can only show you have covid not the specific variants. If you get the test done when your in the hospital they can do more precise tests</p>

        <p>Yeah we are talking about covid not influenza. And like I said once your already confirmed to have covid and are in the hospital for it they do more tests to determine what variant it is. And it doesn’t really matter at that point you have covid. They are from Dallas and area of the United States with high numbers of the delta variant. And if there was no way to test what variant it is how would they even know there are several variants last I heard was a lambda variant. And since the go in alphabetical that means that’s the 12th variant.</p>

        <p>Everyone is this comment section can go fuck off. You have health experts from around the world with political views different and nothing in common coming to the same conclusion. 
Highly transmissible virus that kills old / vulnerable people. Only way to try and limit cases is to have people wear masks, social distancing and (hopefully not) lockdowns. We have PROOFS that this methods work. They do not work 100% but they do slow down the virus. You have access to this data everywhere as proof.
Yet you still choose to not take this into account. Listen to pseudo-scientific figures that say what you want to hear, or just 5 minutes research on google.
Your selfishness infects people. 99% of the people on the hospital are unvaccinated such as yourselves and people than cannot be vaccinated for health reasons.</p>
<p>You are harming yourselves, this I do not care for. But you are harming weak people that cannot be vaccinated and hurting everyone else including your family.</p>
<p>You are selfish entitled small people and you have blood on your hands.</p>

        <p>Actually, we have proof they don’t work. Or at least they don’t work well enough to be worth the cost. </p>
<p>Mask yourself if you want to, I’m done. No you can’t close my business, force a single mother further into financial insolvency because you closed the schools, tax future generations another 10 trillion dollars, or prevent me from living my life any longer. </p>
<p>If you want to stay inside, go ahead. If you want to wear 8 masks, go ahead. If you want to close YOUR business, go ahead. If you want to home school your kids, no one’s stopping you. </p>
<p>Live in a fucking bubble for all we care, but no, your lockdowns and public health mandates <strong>aren’t</strong> working as the cost we are paying for them is far too high for a virus that is, clearly, never going away.</p>

        <p>Alright then, we will see how your speech change when you get seriously sick at the hospital from said COVID, threatening your life and risking your child being in foster care. 
Or better when your parents catch it and statistically die from it.</p>
<p>Loosing your loved ones and ruining their lives when you die because you could not be bothered to wear a piece of fabric over your face or even stay 6-ft apart from other people. Do you realize how silly it is? Even if it reduces by only 1% to catch COVID it is worth doing for your family’s life and yours..</p>

        <p>No, it’s not silly Eykhan, because if you’re scared of that happening then YOU can stay inside. </p>
<p>No one is stopping you from taking measures to protect yourself. This is how a free society works. You are your responsibility. </p>
<p>You know what’s silly? Telling a healthy 25 year old single mother with 2 kids that she has to either quit her job or come up with another $1500 a month to put her kids in daycare because Eykhan is scared. When a) we’ve already been doing that to her for 2 years and b) both her and her children’s chances of dying are essentially zero if they have no co-morbidities. </p>
<p>You’re not thinking rationally. You’re acting like your policies have no consequences. Have you seen the prices of food? How good are your lockdowns if they create hyper inflation, bring on the next Great Depression, and see millions die from starvation and poverty?</p>
<p>Think, Eykhan, think. Enough is enough.</p>

        <p>I feel like your emotions are taking over the argument. I am trying to keep this conversation that we have friendly and fact-oriented.</p>
<p>Yet you keep on mentioning lockdowns when apart from my first post stating that lockdowns are effective at slowing down viruses, I am not advocating it as of today. It is a last resort measure and I honestly believe that government will not put any other lockdowns because as you said the economical and psychological consequences are terrible.</p>
<p>What I am, however, advocating for is to wear masks inside, preferably outside if you cannot keep a 6ft distances from other people. As we all know mask are a pain in the ass, not comfortable and you sweat a lot in them especially during summer. Yet as I said earlier it is a small price to pay for keeping your loved ones and yourselves safe from the disease.</p>
<p>I am not scared, I am a young healthy 24 years old male. My family is vaccinated. What I do not agree with is the selfishness of not wearing masks and keeping social distances. Again not talking about lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Right. Have you been living under a rock for the last 2 years?</p>
<p>Step 1) just wear the mask and muh succiallyy doistering!!</p>
<p>Step 2) just close “non-essential” businesses for a short while</p>
<p>Step 3) just close everything for 2 weeks to “flatten the curve”</p>
<p>Step 4) extend lockdowns for months</p>
<p>Step 5) let everyone out for a month</p>

        <p>Nice civil conversation we have here. I am sorry that provokes such anger to you.</p>
<p>May I remind you that now we have the vaccine, which greatly reduced the risk of being hospitalized because of the disease ? </p>
<p>More so you have derived from our topic by:
1) Deliberately ignoring, why you are selfish by not wanting to put on a piece of fabric over your face 
2) Making assumptions on the next moved by the administration. Once again not the topic of discussion. </p>
<p>I will put that into the fact that you cannot answer my first question and try to reassure yourself that you’re in the right for how you behave because of the suffers lockdown has brought to you.</p>
<p>So I want you to be sure that you understand your selfishness about the mask and social distancing. This virtually has no cost on you apart from minim discomfort.</p>

<p>I’ve been wearing a mask for at least a year now. Why is COVID still here? I’ve been working from home for almost 2 years. Why is COVID still here? I know several people who are now financially ruined, in massive debt, lost their life savings, and had to close their businesses, so why is COVID still here? Almost everyone I know injected themselves with experimental drugs that were supposed to eliminate COVID, so why is it still here? </p>
<p>They don’t know what they’re doing or what they’re talking about, and neither do you. Wear your little face diaper all you want, bud, but the rest of us are done.</p>

        <p>Okay, but if those things only work when there's 100% compliance, and there wasn't 100% compliance the first time, why would we try to do that again? Especially now that a lot less people care. A plan that requires such high levels of compliance to work is a useless plan.</p>

        <p>Because the whole point of society is group compliance; you don't speed or steal and neither does anyone else which keeps the streets safe and stores in business, with only the handful of criminals being caught. The difference here is that there's so much misinformation and apathy that there's too many people for the police to stop and they can't legally.</p>
<p>The plan isn't useless because it's doomed to fail, but because people won't listen, and he's reinforcing it because it's the most likely way to end this.</p>

<p>Hahahahaha, riiiiight.  That's why they fully censor ANY mention of HCQ, ivermectin, chlorine dioxide, and anything else that's proven effective against the virus.  No.  They don't want this ended, I think you may be blind to their bigger agendas.</p>
<p>Also, the point of society is NOT group compliance.  That's communist propaganda right there.  One point of society is cooperation, sure, but individual freedom and liberty are at the core of values in any sufficiently advanced society.</p>

<p>None of those helps COVID19, the second is for animals, and the third is a cleaning product. You can have group compliance with liberty, and the entire point of society is cooperation so I'd say it's more than a part. While I do without a doubt agree that individual freedom and liberty are vital to growth, I think there's a fare few society's that are quite advanced while not being overly egalitarian (South Korea, the Roman Empire, Russia).</p>
<p>I'm very curious what their bigger agendas are so please reply or DM me because I'd like to know.</p>

        <p>All do, in fact.  HCQ: See the Zelenko protocol. Ivermectin: see India, or JRE #1671, or really any of the interviews by Dr. Kory on it. ClO2/chlorine dioxide: Taiko Pharmaceutical has a patent on it's use for lung infections and a few products brought to market.</p>
<p>Point of society is another discussion, but it's certainly not group compliance.  "Every fact of science was once damned. Every invention was considered impossible. Every discovery was a nervous shock to some orthodoxy. Every artistic innovation was denounced as fraud and folly. The entire web of culture and ‘progress,’ everything on earth that is man-made and not given to us by nature, is the concrete manifestation of some man’s refusal to bow to Authority..." RAW</p>

        <p>No, no they don't. From what I've seen Dr Zelenko isn't the most credible source and his 30 June 2020 study seems to not include a wide enough control group. Ivermectin has not been successful in India, as to why they've stopped using it. Not sure what Taiko's patent has to do with things but, again, ClO2 doesn't seem to help it.</p>
<p>In response to that RAW quote, you can have group compliance while refusing to bow to authority. Revolutions are all about refusing authority but can only exist if the rebels comply with one another against a common goal.</p>

        <p>who was the last person you know to get sick from Covid? I haven't heard of anyone I know catching it for months now, I live in a county of 30k people and we are averaging about 1 new case a day according to the department of public health website, 80-90% of people in my county aren't wearing masks and even at the peak of transmission last year only about half where wearing them so the spread rate is much much lower then it was despite fewer people wearing your Nazi Flair, how do you explain that one away, given how completely useless the vaccines are being proven to be?</p>

        <p>Okay, then if you want to get the vaccine, get the vaccine. If you don't want to get the vaccine, then don't. Very simple! If, by your logic, that we must micromanage anything with even a small chance of death, then that means we must ban cars. We must ban swimming, we must ban hiking. We must ban working in construction trades and the like. After all, there's a chance of death, right? So we should just get rid of the risk. It's the right thing to do, otherwise you just don't care about human life.</p>

        <p>Those papers were most likely based upon research set out by the CDC.</p>
<p>50 million people dead from Spanish Flu alone. Covid numbers do not even reach 15% of that amount. </p>
<p>Put it this way, if the Spanish flu existed in today's population and we had the same levels of treatment as 1918, approximately 2.5 BILLION people would be infected, and a third of those dead, or 833 million.</p>
<p>There is no way to honestly compare these two events and arrive at a viable conclusion. The former was far more deadly than this current "pandemic" from the sheer numbers alone.</p>

        <p>Even at 10%, the point still stands, most people who got the Spanish flu lived. You can apply the argument to what was one of the worst pandemics in recent history. We shouldn’t have done anything then, we should have just let people live their lives. Sorry, I just don’t agree with idea that we should ignore a pandemic because not enough people died. I could just as easily say that punishment for violating the lockdowns and mandates didn’t affect enough people to reasonably argue that freedom is violated. It is a dumb argument either way.</p>

<p>50 million dead was my point. Covid hasn't killed nearly that many. Why does this not seem to matter when it is completely obvious both viruses just don't compare in terms of death?</p>

        <p>Sorry, I’m really not trying to read into your post. It is hard to keep track of things because some people here definitely believe we should have done nothing based on the fact because Covid wasn’t deadly enough. </p>
<p>I want to point out nearly 5 million people have died, and we’re still in the middle of this pandemic. So while it may not be the 50 million deaths that the Spanish Flu hit, we’re also significantly higher than the usual half a million to a million annual deaths from something like the seasonal flu or Hepatitis. There very well could end up being more deaths in Africa for example, where the number infected and the number vaccinated remain relatively low. Hopefully things start improving but even the information posted in this subreddit seem to indicate yet another spike is happening.</p>
<p>The built in assumption to a lot of the opposition to lockdowns is that we have better options. Lockdowns might be ineffective but so is waiting for natural heard immunity. At least for the United States, we really don’t have better options beyond hand washing and social distancing. As a whole the population is hostile to measures like national databases that might make it easier to rely on something like contact tracing like countries like South Korea did.</p>
<p>With the exception of a few people, most people don’t really want lockdowns and economic harm and they don’t want people to die. With a few probably exceptions the Doomers don’t want the new normal any more than the people here.They just disagree about how to get there. Conventional wisdom says that viruses are shared when people are in close proximity to each other. Conventional wisdom says that making sure people aren’t close together will lessen the spread of the disease. Conventional wisdom may very well be wrong, but a lot of people here act like it’s unreasonable to think conventional wisdom will hold.</p>

        <p>The whole population was theoretically vulnerable at the beginning of the pandemic. Had the pandemic been significantly more lethal and they did nothing, society would be on the verge of collapse. Your criticism is based on information gained in hindsight that decision makers didn’t have. You’re essentially saying that governments should adopt a wait and see approach, which could just have easily led to world economic collapse if too many people died.</p>

        <p>We realized pretty quick that this thing was effecting a certain demographic. How we went from 15 days to flatten the curve to this clustercuss is a direct representation of poor leadership.  Sure, at the infant stage of this people were scrambling with little insight. That changed quickly, unfortunately public policy didn’t. Now we’re headed back towards the same ineffective measures in some locations because of the politically correct variant.</p>

        <p>I think there’s an argument to be made that we did flatten the curve, which is why the pandemic was drawn out temporally. The whole point of flatten the curve was to keep hospitals from being overwhelmed and the whole point of telling people initially not to wear masks was so that demand was stifled so that health care professionals could get access to PPE. I would argue that those measures worked about as well as they could have. After that there’s not much more decision makers can do beyond lockdowns. They’re an imprecise, disproportionate response. The US has historically been hostile to public medical databases, making contact tracing less effective. We got a vaccine that may or may not be working, and about 600,000 more people died last year than was statistically likely. Now the numbers are going up again and no one knows what to do. The reality is that making public health decisions is hard, and having the economy grind to a halt serves almost no one.</p>

        <p>Maybe so, but it was just delaying the inevitable. That’s all the 15 day deal was about. The issue is that it gave government leadership a false sense of control. We could never completely hide from covid. Once hospitals were prepared it should have been back to business while the medically vulnerable took extra precautions. Instead, governors saw cases rise and became heavy handed forgetting what the initial goal was: to simply allow hospitals time to prepare. </p>
<p>People were lied to about masks. Plain and simple, a lie from dr. Fauci. I don’t think we should pretend it was anything other than a lie. </p>
<p>The current issue leadership is facing is that they made hollow promises about these jabs. They’ve told the population mixed messages on masking after vaccination and then finally they eased and said vaxed could ditch the masks. Now they’re doing a 180 and are trying to implement universal masking again. People want to get back to normal and currently we are spiraling back to spring 2020 policy. The unvaxed predicted this and are watching and are being vindicated day by day. </p>
<p>You’re correct that making public health decisions is hard, but calling for lowdowns again after seeing how ineffective they were in 2020 is asinine.</p>

        <p>The problem is you guys are only acting with half of the information. You don’t know what would have happened without some of these measures. Instead people are spinning up crazy theories about the great reset, intentional depopulation and a new world order. It strains credibility. Odds are there’s nothing at play beyond simple incompetence. You are asking me to believe that most doctors and disease experts…normal people who are just doing their job…aren’t just wrong, they’re malicious. Not only that, but I’m supposed to listen to anonymous people here who read scientific studies and misinterpret them. Thats not everyone, by any means, but there are a lot of people who have no idea what they’re talking about. That’s a hell of an ask.</p>
<p>This subreddit is a hodgepodge of people who are mad at government for doing what government is supposed to do…assess public health crises and act. Frankly, as paternalistic as it is, it reminds me of my two year old when she gets mad that I won’t let her play with knives. That’s why most people are hostile to this subreddit, not because there’s a grand conspiracy to suppress the truth. And far worse, all of the craziness provides cover if there really is something nefarious going on. There’s so much BS on this subreddit that it is hard to sift through actual, credible, opposing viewpoints. That’s the reason a lot of this stuff isn’t just misguided, it’s actually dangerous. If it is really true that the vaccine is killing people, every post about Bill Gates wanting to depopulate the planet is noise that makes it harder to get to the truth.</p>

        <p>You can compare communities with strict lockdowns to those with more lax lockdowns and get a better idea of the efficacy of those efforts and policies. We aren’t missing half the information anymore, we know lockdowns aren’t an effective means to control the spread. </p>
<p>Most of the arguments I read here are logical and concise, such as advocating against governmental overreach in the form of lockdowns, mandating masking (especially amongst children), and mandating vaccines. Sure, there are some loopy, outlandish viewpoints as well but that’s true for any Internet forum. I’ve seen people on the pro covid vaccine forums advocating that they sell hunting permits so they can shoot the unvaxed with vaccine loaded dart guns. Others advocate that they use regular guns and simply kill unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>My views are: 1. lockdowns are ineffective at slowing the spread and hurt more than they help, especially economically speaking. 2. Masks offer little to no help, unless it’s a properly fitted N95 and as a direct healthcare provider I can attest that it can be difficult to get a properly fitted N95. 3. Vaccines should not be mandatory,especially while in EUA. We are seeing just how ineffective and unsafe they can be. </p>
