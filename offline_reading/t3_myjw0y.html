    <strong>Obese Psychopaths Are Lecturing Us On Empathy And Health</strong>
    <p><p>Two things they clearly have no fucking clue about and are of little importance to them, yet they feel obligated and qualified to waddle in here and fucking tell us what's what. Listen up, lard-ass, the allure of free doughnuts and Facebook likes might be an appealing incentive for you to become a lab-rat and get your rotund, Michelin Man, Baymax body pumped full of poison but I actually have fucking hopes and dreams and something to live for beyond defeating Covid. You wanna fucking martyr yourself and take a rushed, experimental vaccine for a virus with a 99.7% survival rate be my fucking guest, just don't expect me to fucking follow suit.</p>
<p>These contemptuous cock-weasels love to act like they're the biggest empaths on the planet when in actual fact they're mentally ill psychopaths and narcissists who have confused empathy with virtue-signaling. I'd pity them if they weren't actively fucking up my life and calling for my death with the religious, over-zealous fervor of a deranged cultist. These are people that fucking PRAY for more deaths in States like Florida, greedily rubbing their sweaty-palms together like a fucking Bond villain and nursing a tiny, impotent hard-on in anticipation of the avalanche of Covid cases and deaths that are DEFINITELY on the two week horizon. tHiS tImE iT wILl hApPen!</p>
<p>It's been a fucking year and I still have yet to see ANY post or comment from these lobotomized Gomer Pyle fuck-tards that has made me: a) question my beliefs, b) sympathize with them, or c) make me laugh. No wonder they fucking flood this subreddit, the ones they actually belong to are fucking painfully boring cringe-infested circle-jerks. They're all at each other's throats as well; its the fucking Terror and they're all turning on each other for not being Covid-compliant enough. "WHAT!?!?! Did you really just fucking say that you went outside with only ONE mask on when you fucking KNOW the CDC strongly recommends AT LEAST SIX?! SMFH, downvote this plague-rat, strip him of his Wholesome awards and send him right to the fucking gulag for re-education IMMEDIATLY!!! I AM LIT-ER-ALL-Y SHAKING HERE GUYS!"</p>
<p>Least we all like each other here... just sayin'.</p></p>

        <p>It's funny because the harder they try to convince people to mask up, stay home, get vaxxed, the more I am against everything they stand for. Maybe if they could at least try to see things from our point of view, I'd entertain what they have to say. But nope, they just double down harder and push more people away from their cause. This pandemic is OVER.</p>

        <p>They don't have a cause. It's either fear out of sheer stupidity or virtue signaling. Just earlier one of them left me speechless eventually, I could not believe how fucking stupid and yet confident someone can be. Mind numbingly stupid.</p>

        <p>I feel the exact same way. If everything was on the table and people weren't getting censored then I would feel more inclined to give the vaccine a shot. <em>Da dum chh</em> ü•Å but they are trying to cover up bad press about the vaccine because they so desperately want herd immunity.</p>

        <p>fatties are the ultimate kens/karens. they are selfish gluttons who give no fucks about their health, and then when "covid" came around, they freak out cuz they are already co-morbid, so now they freak out and tell everyone to ruin their normal lives just to save the fatty.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>how about put the fork down so you wont be co-morbid anymore and wont die from basic shit like the flu, cold, and covid lol</p>

        <p>fat or regular weight it's more about people with empty lives.  They are losers at life with no friends and desperately want to feel relevant and welcomed into a group that will have them.  So covid is just a cult of lunacy that they are thrilled to be part of.  Nothing like a loser at life doing their best to make other's lives as miserable as theirs.</p>
