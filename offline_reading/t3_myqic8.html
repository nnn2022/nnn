    <strong>If you need to convince someone that a disease is dangerous, then it probably isn't</strong>
    <p><p>You don't need to convince me about how deadly and dangerous rabies is. Or AIDS. Or HPV. Or Hepatitis. Not to mention non-contagious illnesses like cancer, cyrrhosis, alzheimers, parkinson's etc. You know why? Because those diseases ARE dangerous -- and I am scared of them. Spanish flu or bubonic plague sure sound like pandemics that were scary and deadly as fuck. And if Ebola ever mutates into being airborne, you can bet your ass I'll stay the fuck home and wear as many masks as you want me to.</p>
<p>Yet well into a year with this pandemic, with constant 24/7 information bombardment about it, and I'm still nowhere near being convinced that covid is a dangerous disease. I've gotten into countless arguments with people over this virus on the internet - some of them healthcare workers, I've known people who had covid, and even a few people who had died from it. I really tried my best to see if I was missing something that other people understood. Nope, sorry, I literally can't see any reason for freaking out. I really can't. Not because I'm a heartless, selfish monster who doesn't care about people supposedly dying so that he can go have a coffee at starbucks, but because I genuinely can't see anything dangerous about this virus.</p>
<p>I'm not anti science nor do corona-believers have a monopoly in believing in science. But If science starts contradicting my eyes and my mind, I'm more inclined to believe my own eyes. There's no collapse of healthcare everyone's speaking of. No piles of dead bodies at every corner. No orphans crying out for their moms and dads in hospital halls. None of the apocalyptic scenarios have come to pass. And there have been enough instances of reopening, and places remaining open long enough to determine it's not because lockdowns have prevented such scenarios. </p>
<p>Just wanted vent and also to put this out there in case if this already hasn't occured to some people, just one more argument against lockdowns. Not like any of the coronazis will ever change their brainwashed minds, but who knows.</p></p>

        <p>The WHO on March 2020 predicted COVID was going to have a 3.4% fatality rate. </p>
<p>They were 1200% off.</p>
<p>It's .01% more fatal than the .02% 2018 flu season.</p>
<p>When you fuck up and still try to manage off that 1200% wrong number you for sure have to convince people.</p>
<p>Places like Texas and Florida are now managing properly off that .03% number</p>
<p>The other state like NY or California are still panicking, overreaching and bungling public health policy by pretending it's still the 3.4% number</p>

        <p>3.4 was the Case Fatality Rate, which is different than the Infection Mortality Rate. But they didn’t bother to explain the difference (Case fatality Rate is the rate of people who go to the hospital that die, whereas Infection Fatality Rate is the number of people who died out of everyone that is infected, most of whom don’t go to the hospital) And WHO compared the expected COVID CFR to the Flu IFR, which was misleading and why everyone initially freaked out.</p>

        <p>When this whole think started, the thing that would infuriate me the most was when people would compare it to the flu. Well I was wrong for getting mad at that. The flu can be dangerous (and deadly) to seniors and people with certain pre-existing conditions. Its exactly like the flu. It might even BE the flu since it replaced it.</p>

        <p>I work at a cemetery and you'd think bodies would be piling up during a pandemic, but no, it's been business as usual (pre-pandemic). Most of our burials have been elderly people who died from natural causes, the rest are mostly middle-aged people dying from unhealthy lifestyles.</p>

        <p>I am in hospital struggling not to die of covid. It feels pretty dangerous to me. And it feels much much worse than the descriptions. My skin is a mass of pain but no rash or signs. Every joint in my body is such agony they're starting to talk about morphine. If they take me off oxygen I will pass out on a minute. I'm still annoyed they tried that on me. Even a sip of water will make me heave. And they say it will be another 2 weeks at least before they can tell if I walk out of here or leave in a body bag. Never had a day's flu or cold since I stopped smoking 35 years ago. I almost died of cholera once. This is worse.</p>
<p>3 neighbours in my street dead if it. My wife's lying in the next ward even worse. If you don't think this is covid, what is it? Or do you think I am making this up?</p>

        <p>Because why would someone torture themselves browsing NNN from the covid hospital? And unless you live in a retirement village, you should buy a lottery ticket if you know that many people who got the cough that bad?

        <p>This time yesterday you were wondering how to install mods on 2K. After that, for hours on end, you debated philosophy. You don't look like someone who is dying of covid, moreover whose wife is dying and in even worse condition. </p>
<p>How do I know this? I've had almost my entire family in hospital. Some of them died in IC, all alone, in a dark room, with no one next to them to guide them on their passing and carried out like animals. None of them had the physical strength or willpower to do anything related to the outside world besides ocasionally speaking on the phone. If they even had the power to do so.</p>

        <p>You are a disgusting human being who knows noth8ng about me. I can lie here and type with little strength. Ysing my mind to engage with others instead of dwell on my situation. With no real facts you form a snap judgement. Would a photo of me in the ward convince you because I will send you one?</p>

        <p>I'm not actually. With no real facts you form a snap judgement without knowing anything about me.</p>
<p>Even if you are sick, you still are, by definition, an attention seeker. You purposely comment and engage with communities in order to have your opinions heard instead of focusing on your potential life threatening disease or being the one who protects and consoles your wife. If she is as bad as you say, she might not be able to go to the bathroom by herself or even get up from the bed. I have first hand experience. I had to take care of people I cared about in this condition.</p>
<p>Some of us have seen and experienced the actual dangers of COVID, we know how much potential it has to be dangerous or even life-threatening, but we still understand the much worse danger of government overreach.</p>
<p>Some of us respected every social norm that was imposed and the most vulnerable in our families still got sick and some perished. Why? Because we need to do what every responsible human being should. We need to work and we need to procure food and we need to take care of our elders and loved ones. No vacations, no useless trips, always wearing a mask. It didn't work. We still got sick, that's the way of things.</p>
<p>Instead of engaging with strangers on Reddit about how oh so sad your situation is, know that everyone has gone through hardships, from losing people near and dear to their hearts or their entire livelihoods. And the last thing you should do is worry and get stressed about strangers on the internet.</p>
<p>Focus on yourself, your wife, whatever you are doing there. Focus on that gaming rig of yours and how you'll play Borderlands or Civilization or whatever 2K games you own when you get better.</p>
<p>I'm not disguisting, I'm not a COVID denier, I'm just wary of our potentially tyrannical governments. And I don't feign affection or interest.</p>
<p>Get well soon. 🎈</p>

        <p>Woah woah, you're getting aggressive bud. COVID is known for temperamental changes after all.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact I do. As I told you, I've been in one. We managed to stay with each other, you know, isolated together. Maybe you are so privileged that you live somewhere where everyone is isolated separately. Well not everyone in the world has that kind of conditions. A lot of people stayed with each other even. Strangers died next to one another.</p>
<p>You're not special my guy. You are in no position to insult anyone. Stay in your seat, watch your health, and stop thinking that you're more important than someone else. As a matter of fact you are not. No one is. Most of us do in fact know what you're talking about, we just have a problem with your tone and language.</p>
<p>Maybe if you want to get sympathy out of people, don't be a passive-agressive, condescending, attention seeking, raging dipshit.</p>

        <p>You seem pretty articulate for someone supposedly dying. When my grandfather was on his deathbed he was in no condition speak or even move his arm let alone browse reddit. But I'll play along anyway and in case you aren't a troll I hope you get better soon.</p>
<p>If you are really sick in ICU due to corona it's because you are part of the unlucky 1% or so who develop severe symptoms, and chances are you won't be part of the 0,05% who die of it. I've known dozens of people who got sick with it and they are all very much alive, the worst ones had to stay in bed for a few days. One person had to be admitted to ICU and then recovered. </p>
<p>Sorry, I take a look around and don't see people just dropping dead of coronavirus everywhere. There will always be people dying of something in hospitals. This doesn't feel like a deadly pandemic to me. I don't feel alarmed. I'm not scared for my wellbeing. Truth requires no props to make it stand. The fact that you are trying to convince me that there's a deadly pandemic out there tells me there isn't. I've heard stories of tuberculosis, measles, etc. from my grandparents. Covid doesn't feel half as deadly as any of them.</p>

        <p>Never said I was in ICU. Just on oxygen and a cocktail of drugs. And if course truth requires evidence. And if you don't see people dropping dead everywhere you're not looking at Brazil or India. You weren't in Italy watching them stack the corpses in the street last year. And the USA still has the highest death toll in the world. It doesn't matter what you think because you're not using even your own eyes.</p>

        <p>So you were just exagerrating your condition. Got it. If you were really dying you'd be in ICU, believe me. I've been there. </p>
<p>India and Brazil notoriously have shit healthcare systems, and shitty quality of healthcare too. And in the case of India, well, let's just say it's also not exactly the most hygienic nation either. Italy has one of the oldest populations in the world, and America is the 3rd biggest country in the world population wise. 550k deaths in a year, most of whom elderly with multiple sicknesses isn't a high number in a nation of 350 million people. To put it into perspective, there are 2,1 million incarcerated people in the US at any given time. You read that right. There are over 2 million people in prison in the US right now.</p>
<p>Lastly, look up how many people die in total everyday in entire world and compare it to how many people die of covid everyday. It's 200k to 10k. You can verify  this claim on worldometer.info (which gathers its statistics from national and international organisations). So, coronavirus hardly makes up for 0,5% of deaths in the world in a day. I'm not gonna freak out over that number. I have higher chance of dying from literally any other disease.</p>
