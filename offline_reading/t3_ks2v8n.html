    <strong>How do you explain that some countries (like Serbia) have minimal measures and no lockdown?</strong>
    <p><p>I am from Serbia. Here things are bad for the last 30 years. We have a quasi-authoritarian, one-man government with 0 democracy since 2014. I always kept one foot outside of the country by studying abroad, marrying to an EU citizen. That was the plan - to leave Serbia when the time comes, live in the EU, provide a better future to my children, etc.</p>
<p>But I am totally bewildered now because the EU starts being much worse than Serbia. We had some drastic measures for Covid in March/April. Serbia was one of the first countries to do the curfew, arresting people if they go out etc. I freaked out, ran to the village. Seeing all countries go insane, I was waiting for another lockdown as winter started. But the lockdown never came. The government did some basic measures, just out of theatre, only to remove them after two weeks. The life continues normally. The only measure is that nothing works after 9. For the rest, no problem, you can do as you please. Nobody even controls if you are wearing a mask.</p>
<p>I am thinking what the fuck? How come?</p>
<p>My theory is that people here are already 'under control'. Our government knows they can do whatever they please and nobody will protest for anything, even if you were killing their families. Breaking a protest (which occurs once in never) is a piece of cake here. People are gullible, it takes a day of media propaganda to convince them to sit on the floor in a 'peace protest' instead of breaking things. It takes another day to break the protest in full, while convincing people that they have 'won'. Serbians have learned to be defeated sheep.</p>
<p>Could this be a reason for no lockdown? Are North America and the EU doing all this shit just to destroy democracy, freedom of speech, human rights, and to 'train' its citizens? And Serbia is doing nothing because these things have already been achieved? Any alternative explanations?</p></p>

        <p>Here in America we have a State like South Dakota that never locked down and where things have been normal. We also have States like Florida and Texas that locked down initially but apparently won’t be locking down again.</p>
<p>It just depends on what jurisdiction you live in and the politicians who are in charge there. Belarus is another country which didn’t lock down and they might be more similar to Serbia.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind diseases like covid and flu harvest the oldest and exposed populations, which is why western europe and the us are getting hit so hard, they really are somenof the oldest and best cared for populations out there. (Japan is a different story.) countries lower on the health care chart will have far fewer exposed elderly and thus do much better with covid. No need for any interventions at all.</p>

        <p>Fair enough.  Only ~3 year shorter average life expectancy than US.</p>
<p>Other common factors are vitamin D (japan shines here), overall health (US is probably the at/near the lowest of the developed world), and health context, the size of vulnerable population from previous flu seasons (US, Sweden had very mild flu seasons, other nordics, far less so).</p>

        <p>Or they just really don't care if their citizens die. Especially if safety precautions could cause any economic harm.</p>
<p>Going to guess there's not a whole lot of health and safety regulations in general in Serbia.</p>

        <p>Hmmm, good point. Safety precautions here would definitively cause economic harm - this is actually the government's official reason for not putting more restrictions. </p>
<p>And yeah, I guess that Serbian government couldn't care less if people die. </p>
<p>But this is also currently happening globally, in the name of corona. Here, old people are left to rot in care homes. They are like in prison, with no activities planned inside, no possibility to go out or have visitors. Nobody is cutting their hair, and they are getting depressed, starting to smoke a pack per day after decades of not smoking. You are old and have a stroke? They leave you in a hospital, turn your ward into corona ward, infect you with corona, refuse to hand you the phone to talk to your family (so they wouldn't get corona!), and then lie that the hospital is full just to get your family to pay 30 euros per day for an in-hospital apartment (this is lots of money here), where you sit whole day alone in your 84. These are my personal experiences from Serbia. </p>
<p>In Germany and elsewhere, old people are left to die in care homes because the staff have been sent home for quarantine. And all of this in the name of "saving the old and vulnerable". </p>
<p>In Serbia, you have a broken rib? Sorry, go home, you are not an urgent case. In the Netherlands, you have cancer and need an operation? Not possible.</p>
<p>I guess there are many cases like that. </p>
<p>So, they are basically filling hospitals with people with flu, leaving out people who need serious care, and even killing many patients (as it happened in the UK) by putting them on artificial ventilation. And what comes out of this? A worldwide mania of medical staff dancing, like MTV stars, after having citizens clap to them for months from their balconies. They did jack shit, let many people deteriorate and die, and people end up celebrating them from bravery. Yeah, so I guess both governments and healthcare don't give a shit if people die, they just pretend and reap benefits.</p>
