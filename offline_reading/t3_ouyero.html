        <p>Let's completely ignore the fact that Australia has established an extremely thorough system of testing, tracing and lockdowns and that masks have been mandatory for the better part of a year and that it is the reason why the covid death toll has been so low. </p>
<p>The only way for your argument to make any kind of sense is to completely ignore reality. In the very same way, in 2020 influenza related death had drastically dropped and there has been even fewer of those than covid, because covid related measure slowed most transmissible diseases.</p>

        <p>The flu did only 2373 deaths with almost no action.  If we're at 923 with global actions, thats remarkable because people suck and can't fucking do the right thing. Some countries treated it just like the flu with no lockdowns or medical capacity to scale.  Look at usa, india, etc...  fuck all you and your choices.  It's irresponsible, foolish, and deadly to have that attitude and no sense of accountability.  The two are Not The Same.</p>

        <p>COVID-19 misinformation</p>
<p>This section is an excerpt from COVID-19 misinformation § Ivermectin[edit]</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the antiparasitic drug ivermectin became a cause célèbre for right-wing figures promoting it as a supposed COVID treatment.[77]
In April 2020, a paper was published based on purported data from Surgisphere which suggested that ivermectin reduced COVID-19 mortality.[78] It was described as a "retrospective matched-control study of coronavirus patients using a real-time hospitalization database". It was published as a preprint but was retracted at the end of May.[79][80][81] Several Latin American government health organizations recommended ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment based, in part, on this preprint; these recommendations were later denounced by the Pan American Health Organization.[81][82]
In November 2020, a preprint paper was published about a large randomized control trial, led by Ahmed Elgazzar, which apparently showed the effectiveness of ivermectin for COVID-19, and it became widely cited by ivermectin supporters. In July 2021, data from the study was suspected of having been faked. Also the introduction to the paper was discovered to be mash-up of press releases run through software which changed some words. The paper was withdrawn from the Research Square platform for "ethical concerns".[77]
In December 2020, Chair of the US Senate Homeland Security Committee Ron Johnson used a Senate hearing to promote fringe theories about COVID-19.[83] Among the witnesses was Pierre Kory, a pulmonary and critical care doctor, who erroneously described ivermectin as "miraculous" and as a "wonder drug" to be used against COVID-19. Video footage of his statements went viral on social media, receiving over one million views as of 11 December.[84] In the United Kingdom, Andrew Hill, a senior research fellow at Liverpool University, posted a video of a draft meta-analysis that went viral before it was removed.[85] An evidence-based review of Hill's paper by scientists at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Health Studies in Valparaíso, Chile found "serious methodological limitations" which cast the findings into doubt.[86]
During the pandemic, a number of misleading websites appeared purporting to show meta-analyses of clinical evidence in favor of ivermectin's use in treating COVID-19.[86][87] The sites in question had anonymous owners, multiple domains which redirected to the same content, and used many colorful, but misleading, graphics to communicate their point.[88][86] The web servers used for these sites are the same as those previously used to spread misinformation about hydroxychloroquine.[89]
While these sites gained traction among many non-scientists on social media, they also violated many of the basic norms of meta-analysis methodology. Notably, many of these sites included studies with small sample sizes, widely different dosages of the treatment, an open-label design (in which experimenters and participants both know who is in the control group), poor-quality control groups (such as another untested treatment which may worsen outcomes), or no control group at all.[87] Another issue is the inclusion of multiple ad-hoc un-published trials which did not undergo peer-review, and which had different incompatible outcome measures.[90] Such methodological problems are known to distort the findings of meta-analyses and cause spurious or false findings.[91] The misinformation communicated by these sites created confusion among the public and policy makers.[86]
A review article by Kory, Paul E. Marik, and others on the efficacy of ivermectin, which had been provisionally accepted for publication by a Frontiers Media journal, was subsequently rejected on account of what the publisher said were "a series of strong, unsupported claims based on studies with insufficient statistical significance" meaning that the article did "not offer an objective [or] balanced scientific contribution to the evaluation of ivermectin as a potential treatment for COVID-19".[92]
In the United States, the use of ivermectin for COVID-19 is championed by a group calling itself the "Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance" (FLCCC), which says it heads "the global movement to move #Ivermectin into the mainstream". The effort has gone viral on social media, where it has been adopted by COVID deniers, anti-vaccination proponents, and conspiracy theorists.[93] David Gorski has written that the narrative of ivermectin as a "miracle cure" for COVID-19 is a "metastasized" version of a similar conspiracy theory around the drug hydroxychloroquine, in which unspecified powers are thought to be suppressing news of the drug's effectiveness for their own profit.[94]
The viral social media misinformation about ivermectin has gained particular attention in South Africa where an anti-vaccination group called "South Africa Has A Right To Ivermectin" has been lobbying for the drug to be made available for prescription.[85] Another group, the "Ivermectin Interest Group" launched a court case against the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA), and as a result a compassionate use exemption was granted. SAPHRA stated in April 2021 that "At present, there are no approved treatments for COVID-19 infections."[85]</p>

        <p>You'd better wake up. Johns Hopkins Hospital has been SCREAMING for years that the true death rate from flus each year was at LEAST 10 times what they documented it as from 1980-2018.</p>
<p>What was that number they were documenting it at? 60K per year.</p>
<p>Do a little multiplication there son: CoVid was not the pandemic virus they tried to make it out to be and most of the people who died? They died because of that "Stay home... stay safe... rot and die in your bed!" nonsense of lack of treatment by physicians.</p>
<p>If we would have distributed HCQ+Zinc and Ivermectin, two drugs that have been PROVEN to stop CoVid in its TRACKS when given in the first 3 days of infection or prophylactically, my parents would still be alive right now.</p>

        <p>&rt; Dying with cancer doesn't mean dying from cancer, that's how dumb you sound. </p>
<p>If cancer was not the cause of death, then the person didn't die from it. The difference is that one of the diseases is dangerous while the other is not.</p>
<p>&rt; More and more people in their 20-30s are dying</p>
<p>Not true, you just think that because the news now slam statistics in your face. And the people that really are dying in their 20-30s have zero relation to covid, unless we're talking about weakened people who'd be severly affected by a mere flu. </p>
<p>&rt; the flu has never killed upward of 600k people, not even close.</p>
<p>Never said it did. Covid, or should I call it - Flu v2 - isn't killing 600k people either. Either your reading comprehension is super low, or you just ignored my argument.</p>
<p>&rt; PCR test are more often false negatives than false positive</p>
<p>BIGGEST lie you said until now lmfao. PCR wasn't even created for these kind of tests in the first place and the false positive rate is most likely way beyond 50% with the cycles that are normally used in the testing. </p>
<p>&rt; not a reason to kill more by stupid negligence</p>
<p>True, unfortunately many people aren't getting cancer treatment along with treatment for other diseases because of this BS and dying because of that. People with the fucking flu are being tubed in the hospital which also leads to their deaths and many are dying or ruining their health by taking the fraudvid jab (which makes this - "More and more people in their 20-30s are dying" - kinda true, but not for the reasons you thought). </p>
<p>So yes, more people are dying, but that's because of YOUR stupidity, along with the stupidity and corruption of what you worship the most - the government.</p>

        <p>It’s hard to think critically or outside the box huh? You’ve never associated the 600 000 thousand deaths to a glaring reality that in the US, and for that matter, all of western culture, we have a massive obesity problem… so much so, that it kills more than starvation right now… what’s even more insidious… is that it is promoted and normalized in a corportocracy led existence… lol it’s nice to think Russians or North Koreans are brainwashed by the state but theres no way a westerner can’t be… lol… a “western altruist” should be an oxymoron at this point… </p>
<p>You just keep cradling yourself thinking the most enlightened pharmeceutical scientists or the pinnacle of intellectualism in the realm of genetics cant sometimes overlook things or worse get something wrong… is it too scary to admit that the <em>slightest</em> variable or nuance could’ve been overlooked even with the best intentions… or you just piously believe in their abilities… like there’s no way we as a species tend to collectively have our heads so far up our asses to think we can control nature or an <em>endemic</em> virus at this point with a manmade medical technology… </p>
<p>Or if you want to scoff off the very real potential for antibody dependant enhancement and the implications thereof… that’s cool too… </p>
<p>If you want to deny the reality… and fauci’s recent statements suggesting the viral load in vaxxed and unvaxxed recipients who catch covid is exactly the same… it’s only that the vaxxed have less severe symptoms… so even if you segregated all the vaxxed from unvaxxed… ya know “medical apartheid” something you brown shirts really want right now, the virus will continue to mutate in the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike… since it’s endemic now… </p>
<p>You don’t want to consider the law of declining virulence… you don’t want to consider that dwindling hospitalizations attributed to vaccine success which we can admit they are… could also be attributed to natural immunity and or a combination of the two… </p>
<p>You don’t want to think that doctors and specialists that have raised “concern” and “speculate” that some downsides to mass vaccination could have some potential adverse and unforeseen consequences… even when they admit to there “concerns” and admit it’s “speculation” they’re still labelled quacks, censored or silenced… even though this very notion of contrarian thought in debate and discussion is a <em>pillar</em> of the scientific method!! </p>
<p>If you don’t think it’s strange that the vaccine campaign and resources attributed to all its marketing and advertising could’ve “equally” been met with just as much of an emphasis on empowering people with healthy lifestyles EI eating 10 servings of fruit and veggies a day… daily exercise… balanced diets… and an aversion to processed foods and too much meats and the profound impacts a healthy lifestyle has on increasing youre chances from avoiding hospitalization from covid… and basically every other known disease and sickness associated with poor lifestyle and nutrition… maybe people would be more trusting of big pharma and govt… but no it seemed that way of thinking is a little bit to opposing to corporate ideals… </p>
<p>if you’re at risk, extremely unhealthy, and want to continue smoking or eating fast food everyday for lunch… and don’t want to exercise or improve your overall personal life then by all means take the vaccine…</p>
<p>Even as new data surfaces daily… all I ask… is to explore other narratives or information maybe it’s a mix of truth from everything… broaden your horizons… I read the exact same mainstream narrative… the established doctrines put out by doctors and scientists on msm, r/coronavirus, CNN, that you do… more so I try to be conscious that’s it’s all propaganda FOX is, the NNN is, every goddamn media platform is… but which ones are completely non partisan? Independant? I don’t know…. Maybe a transparent debate would help? Otherwise… I know I could be wrong… led astray… cognitive dissonant… dunning Kruger afflicted hypocrit… do you ever question yourself? Or the experts? You don’t have to be a rocket scientist to do so… which leads us to the other problem that we tend to look down on uneducated people.. demean them… to a point where the narrative right now suggests that they don’t even deserve a voice… it’s fucked up.</p>

        <p>The 600,000 number is quite inflated given how a covid death is counted. Here is one example of that: https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/nypost.com/2020/11/18/croatian-man-who-died-after-falling-from-ladder-was-killed-by-covid-19/amp/</p>
<p>Also the cdc have said that 95% of covid deaths in US have at least 2 or more co morbidities (don’t have the source on me right now sorry) Yes covid isn’t something that I would wish on anyone of course. But most of these deaths could have been prevented if we focused on our health and used therapeutics such as ivermectin and not force people to be vaccinated.</p>

        <p>And at this point the vast majority has been affected already, most without even knowing it. The lockdowns only does one thing, and that is prolong the number of people getting infected, so that whenever they open up they get a ”wave” which they then use as an excuse to lockdown again. If nobody had lockdowns and nobody reported on this then nobody would know there was a pandemic because people arent just dropping on the streets like the plauge</p>

        <p>Guess what dipshit, I will continue living almost exactly the same way as before the pandemic. The only change in my life is I have to wear a mask in an uber or in the bus. No vaccine for me, I trust my immune system to keep me healthy like it has for the last 35 years. How come yall fascists weren't yelling at me or trying to restrict things when I refused the flu vaccine every year of my life? I wasn't being told how much of a danger I was then, does your moronic moral alarm only go off when the government is trying to obtain more and more power? All the people who died of the flu was just a shit happens moment for you people, but covid deaths are somehow different to you?</p>

        <p>If you won’t get the vaccine for yourself, why not get it to protect against those who are not able to be vaccinated and are at a high risk of death or long-term side effects from contracting COVID? I would rather not see my son die because a healthy adult, fully capable of getting vaccinated, has contracted the virus and passed it along. Your illness is likely to be short-lived, but many people are at a serious risk of dying if they get sick with this virus. That’s why we advocate for those who are vulnerable to get the flu shot as well as those who are healthy.</p>

        <p>Maybe most kids, but I am a parent of a NICU baby who was born with holes in his lungs. Catching a highly contagious virus that affects the respiratory system would likely kill him. Spending life inside doesn’t feel like much of a life, yet that is what we are doing until the vaccinated numbers are higher. Very disappointing to see all the people on this subreddit so willing to throw others to the wolves because they themselves are afraid of a needle.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that.  Most who make the "kids can't be vaccinated yet" argument are not accurately assessing the risk most children face, and I apologize for assuming that was your position.</p>
<p>But do not mistake hesitancy to take a brand new medicine with being "afraid of a needle".  Drug trials typically take 3-4 years to see if any long-term effects emerge, and that's been skipped for these vaccines.  Maybe it'll all be fine (I really hope so) but maybe millions will be suffering even worse effects than covid in a few years time.  We simply can't know until the time passes.  The risk of blood clots and heart inflammation may only be the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Delta appears to spread just as easily if not faster in more highly vaccinated populations, so you shouldn't blame those new cases on the unvaccinated.  Coronaviruses will not be eliminated by vaccines nor any other measure; they mutate too quickly.  The good news is the evolutionary success of viruses (and parasitic lifeforms in general) inversely correlate to deaths of their hosts, and I believe we're already seeing that with the significantly lower CFR of Delta.  By the time we reach Epsilon or Zeta, the symptoms may be as unremarkable as the previous coronaviruses that we all just took in stride as a form of the common cold.</p>

        <p>I work with the same 5 people every day and I run a machine and dont see people. I am not coughing in anyone's face at Walmart when I do my weekly shopping. If I felt sick I would wear a mask anytime I left the house. How could I possibly give it to your kid. Also only 25 kids died from Feb 2020 to march 2021, so the likelihood of your kid dying in a car wreck is way higher than covid. Stop being so scared of a virus that's only twice as bad as the flu. Move on already.</p>

        <p>I had the vaccine, no regrets, and recommend it to everybody. But that's not really the issue at hand. I beg of you please do some research on history and the risk of fascism, it's the greater evil than the tiny risk of illness from covid.  We are venturing into a dangerous philosophical debate on whether free will is worth the cost to society and I'll fight with everything I have against the authoritarians and fascists.</p>

        <p>I do believe fascism is bad. You are correct, congratulations. </p>
<p>There is no correlation between fascism and wiping diseases off the face of the earth. Every one understands what you all are getting at, but you are reaching. Far. Subreddits like this shouldn’t exist. </p>
<p>If I were you, I’d be worried about fascism arising through MSM. Because that and the wealth divide is where its gonna come from, not protecting the public against a deadly virus.</p>
<p>Lastly, I think the vaccine should be mandatory. Dumb fucks should not be allowed to be dumb enough to basically kill people. So free will should end just like where free speech does.</p>

        <p>Anecdotal one-off stories are not a reason to shut the whole world down for almost two years, destroy everyone’s mental health, collapse small businesses, while getting fucked in the ass being told “we are all in this together”. </p>
<p>While most of us are in “this”, the elites are getting richer, regimes are clutching to more and more power, and most of society as you know is no longer liveable.</p>

        <p>for this specific case we have - you demanding others to share with you their vaccination status because “you told them so”</p>
<p>this was your starting point. and I told you that evidently you have zero rights for this information, and telling you to foff would be a perfectly reasonable response. you don’t need to like it tho, you can keep crying and demanding, and even stomping with your little feet</p>

        <p>Then they present the evidence showcasing the risks of the medication. That is the difference between a statement and evidence, you never read up on any scientific papers do you? You're the type of person that only listens to announcements and reads statements.</p>
<p>Fauci might as well beat you to death and rape all the girls in your family while telling you that you are safe from him.</p>

        <p>Are you thick? Look furthur down, there's more than that 1 irrelevant figure, you weren't looking at deaths.</p>
<p>It's 18 deaths per milllion vaccine administered, "6,340 reports of death (0.0019%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine"</p>
<p>What makes you think that covid's kill rate is 2% (20000 per million) if you remove those that died due to their obesity, diabetes and flu at the same time as covid 0.08% is the figure (less than 0.07/0.06% by NHS figures). Obesity is counted as covid deaths unlike VAERS measured medication effects deaths.</p>
<p>Under the same standards it's 0.0019% against 0.08%. Furthermore age isn't a significant enough correlate of medication deaths that any doctor/scientist has pointed it out but being older than the life expectancy of your country is.</p>
<p>Taking those into consideration if you are young and healthy enough based on countries/states data on extremely young covid death cases it's closer to 0.2/0.1 deaths per million. This is far lower than 0.0019% medication death rate, keeping in mind medication death rate is underdiagnosed covid death rates are overdiagnosed.</p>
<p>Point is in a group of 1 million from a state/small European country, why should over a hundred young and healthy die to medication because 1 or 0 of them died from covid.</p>

        <p>You just weed out the ones who put their politics front and center. Conservative or liberal, anybody whose personality revolves around the culture war and who they vote for are easy skips. If they mention the word Trump, either positively or negatively, have more than once picture of them in a mask, "I voted" stickers, anything like that, easy swipe left.  After that you still have to weed out the vapid airheads whose personalities revolve around The Office and just generally regurgitating pop culture.  It's kind of sad how many people that weeds out but I've still gotten some quality dates by finding people who have actual interests and personalities that aren't programmed by the internet and television.</p>

<p>Not because you're actually responsible, but because they resent the fact that you had the wisdom to ask questions and decline while they did not.

        <p>Yeah people have the right to make the decision themselves. However the waters get muddied when misinformation gets spread about things like blood clots. This was only an issue with AstraZeneca, and it is very likely that these blood clots are part of the spontaneous rate of blood clots in the population, not the vaccine itself. And remember they did pause the rollout of that vaccine to investigate, so we're not just dealing with mad scientists that want to poison everybody.</p>

        <p>There hasn't been permanent damage to so many people. Anecdotal evidence is usually pretty weak because people will get a drug, have some supposed side effect, and then attribute it to the drug. Most of the time this is not causal relationship, which is why adverse events are reported to a database so scientists can look for patterns. </p>
<p>Every time some pattern has cropped up like the astrazeneca blood clots, they've investigated it and found that it is very unlikely to be related to the vaccine itself.</p>

        <p>The problem is that anecdotal experiences have a very small sample size, this is why we use large studies and statistics to look for patterns. </p>
<p>Relying on anecdotes is the same reason people believe that the MMR shot causes autism, despite the fact that this is patently false. Propaganda part comes from the news cycle, public figures and news organizations have narratives.</p>
<p>But scientists have to do studies in very very controlled ways using statistical analysis. They have to have the eyes of many scientists with differing opinions look at studies and peer review them. And one study from one institution is never enough, people have to be able to replicate your findings. This is why science is such a powerful tool, information to shared throughout different institutions and individuals to help weed out biases.</p>

        <p>You're right that dissenting opinions shouldn't be censored. A researcher who disagrees with the consensus, such as Brett Weinstein supporting ivermectin, should be allowed to speak on the issue and do research on it. </p>
<p>But on the other hand people also have to be skeptical, because the dissenting opinion of a couple of researchers may not always be true.</p>

        <p>You can make those argument about pretty much any pharmaceutical. Of course pharma companies are going to want to crank out as much as they can for profit. </p>
<p>But on the other hand there's still a great amount of caution in the scientific community about these vaccines. When there was a scare about blood clots with AstraZeneca, the entire vaccine rollout was halted completely until things could be sorted out.</p>
<p>So although there is a profit motive, researchers are still able to remain skeptical and cautious on the whole.</p>

<p>And phase three trial data showing 95% effectiveness were posted in November of 2020. The phases were overlapped to speed things up, so phases two and three began early because the ongoing data from the earlier phased showed a good safety profile. However data continues to be collected in order to find patterns like the supposed blood clots.</p>

        <p>Yeah I like this mindset where people respect each other's decisions. And I think there should be good information available for people to make an informed decision, but when it comes down to it, yelling at people for their personal choices is not a good way to convince anyone.</p>

        <p>I’ve had this exact conversation. It went really well.</p>
<p>Then I had a conversation with another libertarian who claims to be OK with the legalization of prostitution, all drugs of every kind, etc. He could not get over the fact that I refused to get jabbed. I even used the analogy of other people deciding to make decisions I believe are unhealthy like prostitution, drug use, etc. He couldn’t take it and stormed off.</p>
<p>There’s definitely something else going on here. Folks are intellectually inconsistent and can’t make it work in their heads. The lose their minds because of it. Fun times!</p>

        <p>The coronavirus has been around for about 10,000 years in some form. It’s been studied since the 1930s. There’s no reason to think it will go away. Just like the flu there are varieties of flu sometimes the vaccine works and sometimes it doesn’t. But we don’t give up our freedom over it and live in fear.</p>

        <p>Are you seriously comparing this to the holocaust? Do you have a persecution fetish or are you so dumb you genuinely think racism due to something you can't change is comparable to a vaccine, something that you can <em>choose</em> to take or not take.

        <p>So even though vaccine effectiveness is being reported at 40% and 20%, as you can see <a href="https://swprs.org/covid-vaccines-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">here</a>. And lots of "breakthrough" cases all over the world are happening with vaccinated people. Because vaccinated people are still able to spread the virus the same as us. But we are the disease vectors and selfish ones even though for extreamly high vaccinated countries those who are vaccinated are the ones who are primarily spreading covid. </p>
<p>Yeah man, i see no problem with this, its completely rational and fine to restrict unvaccinated people.</p>

        <p>that’s not how vaccination work. knowingly and willing spreading a disease around is not personal choice. the only reason why you shouldn’t get vaccinated is if you are allergic to the ingredients or are immunocompromised. but it’s not your personal choice to be a spreader of a disease. get your damn vaccination you dolts</p>

        <p>Y’all’s really don’t know how vaccines or spreading work at all do you, if most people are vaccinated, so that they do not catch it, they won’t spread it either, limiting the ammount of spreading and therefore deaths. The closer we get to no spreading, the sooner Covid is decreased to a manageable level. Some people cannot get the vaccine, and that is why it is imper it as you get off your fat Facebook glutton asses and get your shot for those who cannot get it themselves</p>

<p>But if say you inhale some virus and it takes up camp in your nasal cavity, you could hypothetically breathe it out and give it to someone before you immune system takes care of it.</p>

        <p>That's true for most vaccines, but is it true for this one? The Science™ and bodies such as the CDC have been contradicting themselves nonstop for months on the subject. The latest I've heard, as backed by the CDC reccomending that even vaccinated people wear masks, is that vaccinated people can still contract and spread the virus, but that the vaccines can prevent symptoms from being bad enough to hospitalize the person in ~95% of cases where they would otherwise have been hospitalized. If this is wrong, I'd be happy to hear it, but I believe that the current consensus is that the shots do little to slow the spread through the population.</p>

        <p>The vast majority of viral transmission for any virus happens due to the symptoms. This is why viruses have evolved to cause coughing and sneezing, because then you end up expelling a lot more fluids than you would if you didn't have symptoms. </p>
<p>With a lack of symptoms transmission is still possible, but will be greatly reduced.</p>

        <p>Ok, makes sense, but that undermines the entire idea behind the measures our governments inflicted on us last year, and it doesn't jive with what the experts are saying. My point is that the official story on these things is a confused, inconsistent mess, and I am not convinced that the vaccines stop or substantially slow the virus, because even the experts pushing hardest for the vaccines don't seem to think that's the case.</p>

        <p>Vaccines don’t make you 100% safe from the virus, you can still catch it and you can still spread it, all the vaccine does is weaken the symptoms the vaccinated person gets, whether than person then gets any additional unforeseen side effects, we will have to wait a few years and find out</p>

        <p>&rt;* all the vaccine does is weaken the symptoms the vaccinated person gets</p>
<p>So basically I can accomplish that exact same thing by going to Walgreens and picking up some NyQuil.</p>
<p>Which is what I have done every single time I have gotten sick for 30+ years.</p>
<p>NyQuil + Vitamin C + water = my secret recipe anytime I get sick.</p>

<p>Here ya go.</p>
<p>You're not gonna change your mind. You made your decision. We will see where things end up in a few years.</p>
<p>The acute cases are disturbing. As are the chronic cases and the odd heart problems people are running into weeks or months after the injection, as well as dementia as a friends father is experiencing right now.</p>
<p>And people drawing connections and doing real science on the subject, explaining how the bosy producing spike proteins will really effect things are being silenced and maligned.</p>
<p>The conversation should not be so gamed, and the fact that it is is disturbing.</p>
<p>The variants are going to keep cropping up, and you're going to keep needing more shots, whereas people who have cleared the virus have a natural immunity to the variants because the vody actually understands the virus in their case.</p>
<p>In your case, all it does is get your body used to the spike protein, so that in some cases it is not treated as "other" and so the symptoms don't show up. But just because the symptoms aren't coming up doesn't mean there is no damage.</p>
<p>The symptoms are a sign that the infection is being fought off.</p>
<p>But you are not going to change your mind because for one, you already decided to get the shot, so you need it to mean something. And I get that.</p>
