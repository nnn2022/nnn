        <p>I said repeatable science. As in the scientific method (not scientism). Example water at sea level boils at 212 f, or 100 c. This a fact (no skepticism), because the scientific method proved it. Same result every time. The experiment (not a study, trial, or epidemiology) is either going to prove, or disprove the hypothesis, either way it is proof of cause, or non cause. Either way the data is empirical.</p>

        <p>I personally love how there are these 2 huge studies that were actually published directly on the CDC website that show just how useless masks are when it comes to randomised controlled trials that have been done over the last 70 years and also from when they have analysed all the covid data from the lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Yes I have read them..</p>
<p>The first link is a large meta analysis of different studies and summary of their findings with averaged results.  They go through data on many studies that go back almost 70 years.</p>
<p>And sure some of them didn't have as much data as they wanted but there's a nice little summary graph in there in case you missed it that shows there's a clear correlation between like a dozen different studies over almost seven decades that shows masks had almost no impact on the results of the different test groups.</p>
<p>And yes that huge meta analysis is not specifically testing anything related to covid because it only goes up to the year 2018-  If you had actually looked at the years of all the studies and when they were done you would have realised this.  The point of the meta analysis was to show that there was almost no effect on the different test groups when it came to masks.  </p>
<p>And you bring up personal hygiene and cleaning your house? What the hell impact could that possibly have in regard to you catching covid or the flu or anything else going around? Absurdity</p>
<p>And did you even read the second link??  </p>
<p>It's a very in depth analysis Of all of the lockdown measures that were taken in the US and there's a very clear breakdown of all the information they looked at in all the counties in the country and they cross-referenced all data regarding mask mandates and which counties had them and which one's didn't and for how long as well as diving into the effects of closing different businesses down like restaurants etc.</p>
<p>In this lockdown study they conclude that they could only attribute mask wearing to making a difference of 1% in case and mortality rates.</p>
<p>One percent...</p>
<p>There are tons of other studies regarding masks and their inability to protect you from an airborne virus but you probably don't care because you clearly can't accept any sort of information that goes against the agenda that's been pumped into your mind by the TV.</p>

<p>LMAO. Wtf are you even talking about? I guess that's why doctors use clean, newly unwrapped utensils, and why hospitals are kept spotless all the time. Really? Being clean doesn't prevent illness? God damn you people are absolute morons. Also - I didn't 'bring this up'. The article did. More evidence showing that you CLEARLY did not read the articles you keep touting. Or, more likely, you didn't comprehend a single fucking word you read.</p>

        <p>You're clearly just trolling at this point...</p>
<p>Yes- The meta analysis brought up hand washing and other preventative measures along with MASKS  Which is why it's a very good study because it looked at multiple different preventative measures and found that masks do almost nothing which you would know if you actually read and were able to interpret the studies.  </p>
<p>And yes hand washing is a known thing that can in general help prevent the spread of any disease or illness  Especially in hospitals which has been proven time and time again and I never said otherwise.  But you are the one who made the weird comment about am I never going to take a bath or wash my hands again or something idiotic like that which makes zero sense whatsoever.   Do you honestly think how often you shower or bathe has any sort of real effect on whether or not you're going to catch the flu during flu season or catch covid? Seriously?  Sure maybe if you're some homeless person who hasn't bathed in 6 months or something crazy like that but everybody pretty much bathes every day or two in some way  Which clearly has no influence whatsoever on your chances of getting covid so I'm completely confused as to why you brought up hygiene in that way.</p>
<p>You keep responding with things that don't even have anything to do with the legitimacy of my original point which is that there are tons of studies out there which prove masks are useless because covid is airborne.</p>
<p>I don't even know why I bother with people like you you are clearly a brainwashed sheep who will believe whatever the TV tells you regardless of how much evidence there is That goes against what they are saying.</p>
<p>And you don't think the studies that were done over a period of 7 decades Aren't legitimate because covid wasn't around then? That has nothing to do with anything, covid behaves essentially the same as the flu does and it's airborne.  So if masks aren't going to reduce your chances of getting the flu how the hell are they going to reduce your chances of getting covid? Do you even fucking think before you type? Jesus</p>
<p>So go ahead and keep deep throating the mainstream media's cock swallowing all that misinformation, have fun doing that the rest of your life.</p>
