        <p>Now that Orange Man is no longer President, can we do this?  The only reason I can think of why society didn't do this is because Orange Man said it was good.  As we know, anything Orange Man said that was good is bad.</p>

        <p>The higher up the chart vertically, the higher the covid.</p>
<p>The black line is people who didn't get any treatment. 90% still had covid at day 6</p>

<p>It's kind of having a dour approach to life, looking to square up to someone they disagree with rather than trying to see things from their point of view. That kind of thing.</p>

        <p>I'm french, i genuinely want to understand your point of view.</p>
<p>The scientific consensus says that this treatment has small to no effect on this disease.</p>
<p>What makes you think that one physician/microbiologist is right and all the others physicians/microbiologists are wrong ?</p>
<p>What political agenda would rejecting this cheap treatment serve ? 
I mean, the whole economy is falling, Emanuel Macron probably lost his ability to get reelected.
Who gets any benefits from this ?</p>

        <p>Wrong my dude: https://c19study.com/</p>
<p>It works extremely well for early treatment. Late, essentially nothing works. Early studies focused on late treatment only and used a dose like 2x higher than the FDA indicated overdose amount, so it killed people.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, there was a study published saying this drug that has been in widespread use for years had horrible side effects. The study was retracted because the company that provided the data refused to comply with an audit: https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/06/authors-retract-controversial-hydroxychloroquine-study</p>
<p>i.e., fraud</p>
<p>There was a French doctor that received death threats. Not saying you have to go all the way down the conspiracy rabbit hole, but there is clearly something fucky going on with non-"vaccine" COVID treatments. They lie to you that there is any kind of "consensus."</p>

        <p>I agree with you the misinformation is widespread nowadays. 
But the same point can be made about hydroxycloroquin  studies, some facts were deliberatly overshadowed.</p>
<p>The sad reality is that, giving the hindsight we have right now, we cannot say that one study is right over another...</p>
<p>Is this just a matter of belief ?
Everything will be clearer in a few years...</p>
<p>I'm choosing to keep beliving in scientific authorities but at least i understand your point a bit more.</p>
<p>But tbh i don't think that the brain of most ppl in this sub functions properply (things I've read: "mask bad : gives covid").</p>

        <p>One study over another? Dude, that's a study aggregator. 203 trials. 3,201 scientists, 173,199 patients. They don't exclude studies with negative results either, but the only ones you'll find are late treatment. 49 publications on early treatment, no negative results. How many is enough? You Euros trust institutions way too much.</p>
<p>There's also no clear consensus on masks either dude, you're just so god damn warped by public perception that you think there is. The virus rides in droplets that float in the air. That's what makes it so contagious. These droplets go around the corners of a mask and will then circulate throughout the room. Have you not seen <a href="https://videopress.com/v/4egEyh2b">videos</a> that illustrate this? What sort of magical apparatus do you think a piece of cloth is?</p>
<p>Additionally, virus will recirculate in your airways, making your infection worse if you had it. An <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">RCT</a> on cloth masks “caution[ed] against the use of cloth masks,” and “[m]oisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.”</p>
<p>And yet we're the ones are whose brains don't function properly? Be reasonable man.</p>
<p>&rt; Everything will be clearer in a few years...</p>
<p>Unrelated, but do you apply the same attitude towards vaccines? Or should people be expected to take it without knowing the long term consequences?</p>
