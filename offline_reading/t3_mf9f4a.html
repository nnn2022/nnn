    <strong>I’m not a conspiracy theorist and actively debate conspiracy theorists.</strong>
    <p><p>I am not in any means pro QAnon, far right, or anti vaccine. I believe that a very critical cost-benefit analysis should be made when deciding to distribute en masse a vaccine that is still in clinical trials until 2023. I believe that the mainstream view has changed from ‘flatten the curve’ and ‘slow the spread’ to ‘eliminate the virus at any cost’ - which is dangerous considering the sharp rise in suicides, mental health issues, drug and alcohol addictions and loneliness that comes as a side effect of state mandated lockdowns.</p>
<p>Vaccines that are currently being distributed supposedly are at least 93% effective (Pfizer)</p>
<p>In the UK, 50% of all adults and 95% of all over 60s are vaccinated. This means the vulnerable are protected and deaths from COVID-19 are minimal compared to deaths from increased consumption of drugs and alcohol and suicides (death rate of 64 per week in the UK.’</p>
<p>Our debt to GDP ratio is 85.58%, and 8% of all UK tax revenue is going toward paying extremely high interest payments as a result of unchecked deficit spending that is required due to lockdowns.</p>
<p>Is this all worth it over 9 deaths a day? When we will allow people to go outside and live life to the fullest? When will people be allowed to go on holiday without facing a £5000 fine? </p>
<p>Our government is pushing a supposed ‘roadmap out of lockdown’ whilst also banning ‘disruptive and noisy’ protests and extending emergency COVID-19 legislation for another 6months. </p>
<p>Why are they pushing one scenario to the public whilst actively giving themselves the powers to impose future lockdowns and ban any protest that goes against state opinions? All protests are noisy, and all protests are designed to cause disruption to incentivise those in power to take action.</p>
<p>Just my two cents, would love to hear everyone else’s opinion.</p></p>

        <p>You are already a conspiracy theorist, you just don't know it. Try posting this in one of the main COVID subs and you'll find out fast that you are a CT. The only reason the government, any government, is doing all of that is to gain more powers for themselves under the guise of an emergency, all while moving the goal posts on when the emergency will end. You're being scammed.</p>

        <p>To add to this: we are not the minority. Everyone is a critical thinker. The narrative pushes us against each other and makes us believe there are only 2 sides to this. </p>
<p>And we're not even trying to argue that vaccines are unsafe or that covid isn't realm some people believe it, but regardless, this sub was made in am effort to get people to focus on this one specific instance because this is NOT a vaccine it is a study and WE are the study group. What were arguing is that the narrative is pushing this to be NORMAL. </p>
<p>And the media, tech conglomerates, and anyone else that could be making money on the world being sick and controlled like this are perpetuating this idea that it's a huge deal. And when it isn't, a new strain comes out. And when that doesn't work, Indonesia's largest refinery blows up. </p>
<p>Wait that last one probably isn't connected.</p>
