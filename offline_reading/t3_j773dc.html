    <strong>So glad I found this group</strong>
    <p><p>Seems like social media keeps trying to shut down people that aren't good little sheep. Glad to see other people think this whole thing is just ridiculous, it's especially hard for me to find those in my political corner that agree with me on this...I can't be the only liberal that thinks wearing masks is ridiculous, and these lockdowns are an overreaction, and that getting sick is a part of life that we had all learned to accept until just recently. Ironically, mass hysteria is more contagious than covid.</p></p>

        <p>lol None of this should be political really. Not sure I'll feel better soon, I am adamantly opposed to the mask nazis, I have no worn a mask yet, of course, that means I have not been in another building in several months, been living off curbside pickups and drive-thru's. I don't think this is gonna change anytime soon, not until a majority of people reach a breaking point, acceptance has to come sooner or later, the virus isn't going anywhere, it's time to move on and live our lives, cause whatever this is, is not worth saving.</p>

        <p>None of it should be political? The entire thing is 100% politics. It's politicians stealing your life from you. One side is fighting back while the other is mask policing. Honestly I have no idea how you can still, after everything these psychos have done, call yourself a liberal. I pray it's just naivety because the shit being pushed and achieved by the left is truly evil. The lies are endless. They have been exposed countless times. </p>
<p>Politicians are the reason we are in this situation. On both sides. So to say it shouldn't be political is some eyes wide closed shit. The entire government is corrupt and fucked, but the left has truly shown to be far more obsessed with stripping you of not only your rights, but your dreams and your dignity. </p>
<p>You are the person that leaves california because it was destroyed by liberalism yet continues to vote for liberals. </p>

        <p>Liberal is a political ideology that supports progressive causes, there's an entire spectrum, but generally, liberalism marks causes that support the collective rather than the individual, whereas conservatism tends to support causes that are marked by individualism. I consider myself a moderate liberal, I believe in sensible things that can benefit us all so long as it does not infringe on our individual liberty. That's an over-simplification, but it's the best way I can sum it up. 
The reason I bring it up is because liberals are moreover in favor of these extreme measures, I happen to disagree with them on this issue. Stances on these measures have been politicized so much that you're either on one side of the other, but this issue isn't political to me...I just want my life back.</p>

        <p>&rt; liberalism marks causes that support the collective rather than the individual, </p>
<p>&rt; I believe in sensible things that can benefit us all </p>
<p>The lockdowns? The social distancing? Mask mandates? </p>
<p>This is liberalism: supporting the collective rather than the individual. </p>
<p>The problem with liberalism is that it necessarily requires some way to determine <strong>what</strong> supports the collective, and <strong>what</strong> benefits us all... and <em>you</em> never get to make that decision, you are always at the mercy of someone else’s decision. </p>
<p>Lockdowns are the direct consequence of ideology that supports the collective rather than the individual. </p>
<p>&rt; The reason I bring it up is because liberals are moreover in favor of these extreme measures, I happen to disagree with them on this issue. </p>
<p>If you believe in a political ideology that prioritizes doing what most benefits “the collective,” you must necessarily accept that someone (who isn’t you or me) gets to make decisions about what that means in practice. </p>
<p>The logical extension of that is that you must <em>accept</em> those decisions even when you disagree with them... they are deemed to benefit the collective, and the impact on you, an individual, is insignificant. </p>
<p>Technically, when you disagree with them, you are selfishly prioritizing your individual needs over the needs of “the collective.”</p>

        <p>You're not.  This is very much a political issue, but it's not left vs right, it's up vs down.  Libertarian vs authoritarian.  It's seemed to me that that's the direction the big political division in the US has been heading in for at least the last twenty years.  </p>
<p>I turned 18 in 2002, and since then, the only changes there've been in my political beliefs are 1. going from "I, personally, don't like guns" to "I, personally, don't like guns, but I acknowledge their necessity" and 2. going from "We should have immigration reform" to "We need immigration reform".  That's all that's changed, and yet I'm expected to believe that I've moved from the left to the right?  No, I haven't changed; the left in this country has simply become much more authoritarian; the right, only somewhat so.</p>
