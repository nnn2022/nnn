        <p>This information was pretty easy to find - it's presented in the same manner, and higher on the page than, other information such as "Face shields are not substitutes for masks," and "Put on your mask safely". Typically you list information in order of importance on a resource page like this so it is more likely they thought the exceptions listed just don't apply to that many people and put it a little further down the page.</p>

        <p>I respect your opinion but do not agree. I feel they should make this information available underneath the line “Children under 12 are exempt but are encouraged to wear masks where practicable.”</p>

        <p>Thank you for pointing that out. I actually missed that at the top of the page in that grey alert. The largest exception (population-wise) to the mask rules are children under 12 so it makes sense that this exemption makes its way to the top of the page. I was contemplating how my explanation is weak because of that large exception being lower on the page but now this makes even more sense.</p>
<p>I have taken part in a few user interface user experience reviews for pages like this and the goal is almost always to answer your most common questions at the top. I just think my explanation is more likely than your position that they are hiding this information.</p>

        <p>I am speculating that they’ve hidden it, but have no proof at this point. This does not mean it’s not true. To maintain maximum compliance with the mandate, this needed to be obscured. If it was clear at the top of the page, then too many people with valid breathing concerns would be exempted.</p>

        <p>They are exempted either way. A person is either exempted or not regardless of whether or not they have read the exemption, right? The page listed the only major exception at the top and the rest which are uncommon are listed further along.</p>
