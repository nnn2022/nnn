    <strong>Link between COVID, vaccines, and geoengineering</strong>
    <p><p>Geoengineering is a topic most people have been conditioned to believe is not happening. However, as we know here on this sub, "science" is basically a tool of the world controllers as is the media. I'd ask you to question what you think you know about the subject. </p>
<p>In his weekly broadcast Dane Wigington frequently addresses the COVID issues we all discuss on this sub and ties it together with other news in the world including ongoing climate engineering programs. 
https://youtu.be/39fok2K-kqs</p>
<p>In the video below, you'll hear a geoengineering "expert" Ken Caldeira discuss an area of study within the geoengineering field which was the seeding of pathogens in climate engineering aerosol spray dispersions. This man now works for Bill Gates at the Gates Foundation. 
https://youtu.be/R4zAHKNCYtk</p>
<p>I'm not saying COVID or vaccines are being dispersed through aerosol sprays, but I am saying it could be. Patents and research exist on the subject and the controllers could do it if they wanted to. There's a clear link between Gates and geoengineering - it's no secret that he funds "research" in this area and has been a proponent of it for years.</p></p>

        <p>this reminds me of something I've read once somewhere. it was about this new bioweapon they supposedly work on, which is made out of 2 viruses which are harmless to the host on it's own, but when both present in an individual, the person dies. it could be that one is sprayed on population through chemtrails and the other injected as a vax :|</p>

        <p>so it could be they want to inject one part through this covid vax and then one day, they'd just fly above the area they want to kill people in, done. very sad</p>
