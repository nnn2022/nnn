    <strong>Uk people; you don't need to wear a mask.</strong>
    <p><p>Ok i'm gonna keep this short. Went to a tesco last night and guard asked me if i had a mask implying they wanted me to wear one. I simply said i'm exempt and he said no problem and i went in. They can't legally ask you why so saying you're exempt is simply enough.</p>
<p>I base this on the grounds wearing a mask would cause me severe distress which is a legal exemption as by wearing it despite the fact i know this covid "pandemic" is a scam, i'd be effectively castrating myself and selling out my beleiefs and that would cause me shame and hatred of myself and crush my pride. I view the mask as one of those red trump maga hats and forcing the people who hated him to wear them which would cause them anger. </p>
<p>Don't argue or cause a scene simply say "i'm exempt" and then walk on in like normal times.</p></p>

        <p>That's what I do and I also carry my inhaler in backpocket, though nobody has questioned further after 'exempt'. Turns out Tesco's and likewise larger stores understand that we'll get our shopping done eitherway, beit through them or the less restrictive smaller store/cornershop.<br>
If you're a cornershop owner, consider how <em>differently</em> you could support your community, as they/we in turn could then repay that support.</p>

        <p>As I keep saying in here, I never wear one, never have anywhere, and I've been asked about it 5 times since they made them mandatory, each time just saying exempt and walking in was enough, never had any further conflict than that (although I would welcome to it, I'm ready to take the first place that denies me entry to court and I wouldn't mind the payday).</p>

        <p>Although, depending on the establishment, they may refuse entry anyways. Businesses can refuse service for any reason, and so this might work in a Tesco, but probably wouldn't in an independent restaurant/takeout etc. You can certainly be refused access to public transport.</p>

        <p>&rt;severe distress</p>
<p>For wearing a thin mask for all of two minutes while you're at a Tesco?</p>
<p>&rt;I'd be effectively castrating myself</p>
<p>For real, how fragile is your confidence, my goodness.</p>
<p>Also, just to clarify, private businesses can kick you out for not wearing a mask. That's their right as a private business. Because ya know, other people have rights too, not just you.</p>

        <p>They can't in the UK, it's illegal under the disabilities act, the same as you can't kick a wheelchair user out just for being in a wheelchair. So, with all due respect, get fucked, I'm not wearing one, have never worn one and never will and I couldn't give less of a shit how that makes you feel.  This has already happened and the business settled out of court for Â£7000.</p>

        <p>Lol, this is OBVIOUSLY about the feelings of you all, then about my feelings, but thanks!</p>
<p>Also, good luck winning a lawsuit by <strong>faking a medical exemption</strong> and then getting the disabilities act to back you up</p>
