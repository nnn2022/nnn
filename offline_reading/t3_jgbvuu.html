        <p>I am not really a mall person. But when they reopened a couple months ago in another city, I traveled there to visit family, and also eat out at a mall, because it had been so long. It was almost normal, but cinemas weren't open, and everyone was wearing a mask if not eating or drinking. But there was no social distancing, all stores were open, and there were lots of people everywhere. About a month ago, malls reopened in my city, and I went there a couple days ago because I had to go to the bank, and it was absolutely depressing. Social distancing stickers everywhere, about half the shops are closed, there was almost no one there, and most of the few people there were so paranoid, they would walk away if someone passed them in a hallway, as if everyone was a bio-hazard.  There was this one time, that I had to go down two floors, and there was a woman in front of me that did the same path. At the start of every escalator, there is a hand sanitizer dispenser, on the first escalator, she sanitized her hands, went down one floor, and sanitized her hands again entering the next escalator, not even 30 seconds later. Really sad to see.</p>
