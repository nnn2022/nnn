    <strong>So was President Trump controlled opposition or not?</strong>
    <p><p>In hindsight its amazing how hard Trump fought the globalist elite, specifically in 2019 / 2020 when he straight up said "the future does not belong to globalists", and then all the constant hate / fact checking whenever Trump opened his mouth, and then low and behold: <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/scientist-waited-legitimize-lab-leak-162344951.html">Scientist Says Some Colleagues Were Hesitant to Legitimize Lab-Leak Theory Out of Fear They Would Be ‘Associated with Trump’</a></p>
<p>...but at the same time, while its nice to think that Trump wasn't on board with their corrupt plans, despite his flaws, an argument could also be made that by all visible measures, Trump aided the Chinese Flu at every stage, even creating a new czar post for Fauci. In reality framing pandemic / government skeptics as Trumpers is just one more chilling technique, designed to keep citizens from expressing our shared concerns. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that Donald Trump also endorses the vaccine (despite what the trolls here say when they call antivaxxers as trump supporters), and he was responsible for Operation Warp speed as well, although Trump actually does say "i recommend the vaccine, BUT I think they should have the right to choose" in a FOX news video, so at least he's giving us the freedom unlike the other side that lean towards making it mandatory.</p>
<p>With these in mind, it can come down to these scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's entirely possible that Trump was anti-establishment and that the elites used this opportunity to create more division between the public, along with constantly "fact-checking" or roasting whatever Trump said on the MSM. The amount of constant hate Trump got in 2020 is pretty damn ironic when you see how in 2021, a lot of what Trump previously said had finally been somewhat vindicated...</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump's intended purpose WAS to be a controversial figure and cause division between the public as well, and he damn well succeeded (if we're going by the theory of controlled opposition).</li>
</ul></p>

        <p>Trump is a grifter, actor and game show host. </p>
<p>He’s controlled opposition. Trump played the rabble-rousing, champion of the people, Teddy Roosevelt gimmick. Roosevelt was controlled by JPMorgan/Wall Street.</p>
<p>Trump’s team consisted of <em>former CIA</em> agent “Coverup General” Bill Barr, Skull &amp; Bones member Steve Mnuchin, and Rothschild banker-Wilbur Ross to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>Skull &amp; Bones judge, James Boasberg</strong>, same year as Mnuchin (1985), played a role for Trump, denying release of Trump’s taxes, and also later on helping Facebook. ^1</p>
<p>Note: <strong>Boasberg was the second Skull &amp; Bones judge to help Facebook in 10 years.</strong> ^2</p>
<p><strong>2016:</strong> Boasberg orders expedited <strong>release of 15,000 Hillary Clinton documents</strong> found by FBI. ^3</p>
<p><strong>2017:</strong> Boasberg said that the <strong>court could not compel the IRS to turn over President Trump’s tax returns.</strong> ^4</p>

        <p>I think this pretty much nails it, I don’t think he’s some evil dictator like the far left makes him out to be but I also don’t think he’s legit.</p>
<p>I subscribed to his campaign’s text message alerts for the hell of it (I’m not even a Trump supporter but I was hoping he would win over Biden - I think Biden is even worse) and I still get them at least once a day asking for donations. He’s ripping off his supporters.</p>

        <p>Look at who he hires and who he surrounds himself with.</p>
<p>Look at what he believed in all of his life prior to his sudden ideological switch at the age of 68.</p>
<p>As president, did he even actually fight for his core campaign promises or did he just pay lip service (at best) and sold out (at worst)?</p>

        <p>Just my personal take, but I think he was controlled opposition right up until the general election. They never thought he would actually win. </p>

        <p>What is important to realize is that the MAGA movement wasn't about Trump. And it is not Trump that offended all those corporations so much. It is the people. The people who dared to vote for something that they got told not to vote. FOX news was also against Trump. The Anti-Trump movement within the GDP came up with the Steele-Dossier. Every single established media outlet and politician - doesn't matter which side - was against it and the people still voted for him.</p>
<p>They do not want to shut down Trump.</p>
<p>They want to shut down the people who dared to vote against them.</p>
<p>Trump was never really able to do anything. All the people he appointed turned against him, since the very beginning. Trump himself wasn't a threat.</p>
<p>But what is a threat is people who do not listen to the propaganda that is sent on all media channels. At some point they would vote for someone who actually has a team and can not be betrayed or controlled. They got threatened by the trend. If the MAGA movement would continue, the trend would revert the roles. Suddenly the politicians would be controlled by the people and not the other way around.</p>

        <p>I mean Trump is a mass-murderer as Supreme Commander of the military, and lied about everything he ran on just like every other president elected in my lifetime, so whether he was "controlled" or just passive is really irrelevant.</p>
