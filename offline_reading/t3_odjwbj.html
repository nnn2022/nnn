    <strong>Does anyone here have no one to talk to in real life? The insanity grows.....</strong>
    <p><p>I can tell my husband is angry at me because I told him I hate the DNC [hate both parties] He keeps talking about voter suppression. It's a problem but doesn't he realize the system doesn't care anymore, there's no freedom. We got into an argument where I said, a lot worse is going on now than that. He said "If they take voting away, then it's game over. I said, "Can't you tell things are already ending with this pandemic?" I should have kept my mouth shut, he's been huffy all weekend. </p>
<p>I did convince him of the health dangers of the vaxx but he thinks I am getting back too deep into "conspiracy" and we have argued about me getting some Ivermectin. [cost, animal source being too dangerous, etc]</p>
<p>We are a couple that was always very close but I fear his NCP best friend influencing him who raced to go get vaxxed almost on the first day. I feel like I am going to have everyone turn on me. He thinks I am nuts when I talk about prepping what could be coming, I can tell. He definitely is put off, that I have made references about bible prophecy and such. </p>
<p>I put up something very mild on FB, maybe I pushed envelope on there a bit. I did lower my interaction a lot but only post a little. I put up a meme of the guy carrying the sign, that says "Even if you are not conspiracy minded something in your soul has to be telling you something isn't right with any of this"</p>
<p>While 1 or 2 newer "friends" [people I know from internet groups] made references to our greedy elite, others gave me the usual lines. "I can't believe you are falling for conspiracies!" and one wrote, "If we need to have more lockdowns to control this and so be it" I didn't argue with them, just left it alone.</p>
<p>I have been completely isolated for almost two years. One group has now made it a rule that the unvaxxed have to wear masks in their building, and that means among the 40 people I will be singled out and all would know. </p>
<p>I was going to delay going back but it seems like this crap is never going to end. I feel afraid inside like all the alarm bells are going off. I would be willing to wear a mask but having that many people "know" stresses me out. It's different to walk around strangers instead of being singled out in a group. That would definitely up the pressure. I also fear reprisals as they blame "variants" on the unvaxxed. This stuff is heavy and impacting real lives. Don't brush off the effects of their psychological warfare on people. </p>
<p>I have had only 5 minute conversations with people in 16-17 months outside of husband and visits with doctors/nurses. There has been no real conversation otherwise. It is affecting my mind. Some here may say, go talk to people but there's no one to talk to. The disabilities have isolated me so badly too.</p>
<p>Things just didn't get any better. Some of us had hard lives this made far worse. I already lived with severe health challenges but this feels like too much. There's no one to talk to because I am already being treated like I am "crazy" and "stupid" to the very very few I even open my mouth to. I walk on eggshells. I don't feel the same about a lot of people and feel utterly betrayed on levels I can't even explain to you. I feel so alone. I am only on the superficial level with people but I somehow ended up with a life with no people in it. I was an outcast enough before with the autism and disabilities but now I am an extreme outcast. I am either superficial AF with people or I am rejected. That hurts inside.</p>
<p>They destroyed my life or what was left of it.</p>
<p>Some of you may be lucky enough to have people around you, that you can be "you" around. I feel totally alone. Even with husband, I care about and love him but why am I having to even "be careful" there now at what I say. What if he flips and joins the crowd? He seemed overeager at hearing about a new non-mRNA vaccine, where I was asking, 'Does it make the same spike proteins?" I get the feeling the best friend is telling him I am "nuts".</p>
<p>Think for yourselves, what it would mean not to have one real friend to talk to in real life, and what it does to a person. Add in the fact that I can tell the vaxx is changing people, and I feel like I am in a horror movie. Oh one of my best friends online is dying of cancer but she took the vaxx too.</p></p>

        <p>It's mass delusional psychosis. I have no other way to describe it.</p>
<p>I'm not the most social person, but I have also found that people who I thought were reasonable and could assess risk <em>absolutely have not been able to</em> with covid.</p>
<p>I don't have a lot of advice for you. I'm in a bit of a similar situation- when talk of covid comes up, I mostly just don't say anything. We are being made out to be enemies, and I don't know if this is going to end well.</p>

        <p>I live in a Cult of the Mask majority run area.. they don't tolerate resistance at all. After quashing any of us who bothered to resist, they had 12 months of Health-mandates to back them up, and they amassed even more power - to the point that if I walked in right now (now that mask mandates dropped) they still have RCMP on speed-dial should I give them any resistance at all after being told to leave.</p>
<p>So do I bother with this action anymore? Nope..  They won.</p>

        <p>I intend to, and encourage other people to, in the short term, have no further discussions or participate in any discussion that relates to their medical information with anyone.</p>
<p>By doing so in any way, immediately recognizes their medical authority over you by compliance - and will embolden them further to pursue such agendas , and make it harder for other people to do the same thing.</p>
<p>But yes, it will be even easier to do that, or not even have it happen, by moving to an area where they respect human rights and privacy more, and don't run their lives based on fear and suspicion.</p>

        <p>&rt;I have also found that people who I thought were reasonable and could assess risk absolutely have not been able to with covid.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's related to what's discussed in this document. Simply the perceived threat of infectious disease will cause extreme blind obedience by the masses.</p>
<p><strong>Threat(s) and Conformity Deconstructed: 
Perceived Threat of Infectious Disease and its Implications for Conformist Attitudes 
and Behavior</strong></p>
<p>&rt;We test the hypothesis that the perceived threat of infectious disease exerts a unique influence on conformist attitudes and behavior. Correlational and experimental results support the hypothesis.</p>

<p><strong>Pathogens and Politics: Further Evidence That Parasite Prevalence Predicts Authoritarianism</strong></p>
<p>&rt;According to a "parasite stress" hypothesis, authoritarian governments are more likely to emerge in regions characterized by a high prevalence of disease-causing pathogens. </p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3641067/</p>
<p>There's a direct correlation between perceived parasite prevalence, civilian obedience and authoritarianism. Governments and corporations know this.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah they researched this. This is mind control and full trauma programming on the entire population. Look in a regular pandemic, we'd be seeing the dead bodies in the streets and piling up around us, no government would have to tell us to stay home. It would be like the Cholera epidemics of OLD. No worries about screaming about masks or stay home. They know everyone is afraid of death.</p>

        <p>Funny you mention assessing risk because my most cautious friend during the middle of the pandemic eventually had at night out with 10+ people and regretted it heavily. Her parents also got covid around Christmas, but she didn’t get it but ended up going out soon after anyways. She has Moderna now and has been fine really but she was so adamant about being safe and taking the right measures but one day it was like a flip switched out of no where, and this was before being vaccinated.</p>

        <p>I live in Toronto, Canada.  No friends at all.  I used to have some friends the previous city I lived in but it's been over 10 years.  My entire family on my father's side, they all got the vaccine.  I told my step mother not to get it but she didn't listen but she didn't get the 2nd shot.  People the way they are because others are. doing and thinking the same way.  </p>
<p>I live in alone and I like it.  I am anti government, my family blindly trusts and follow the government.  </p>
<p>I wouldn't try to debate or argument.  it is pointless, once a person is brainwashed he or she is pretty much done.</p>

        <p>Wow that’s a tricky situation but I can kinda relate in a way. I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t know some people that were awake to this bullshit because whenever I’m online it seems hopeless. I’m younger and from NY so it’s really liberal and recently deleted my Instagram towards the end of trumps presidency after nonstop posts from kids from high school ab and jan 6 and BLM and how if you vote for trump you’re a white supremacist. my friend on Instagram says he sees a lot of people posting how the vaccines are safe and other shit propaganda similar to that now. It’s sad to see how brainwashed people are. They literally have everything backwards. They are fueling the propaganda as activism and think they’re morally superior for doing it</p>

        <p>Yes, it won't get better. I grow frustrated watching some of what is going on, with the ignoring of what Covid has done to the ghetto. The town I live in now neighbors a "ghetto area", I am over there sometimes, and the poverty is astounding and growing WORSE and think some murals are going to fix things? The Limousine liberals make things worse in the ghetto. I question that absolute power stuff too. I am a disaffected liberal but I am questioning the endless talk, where things grow worse and worse. The homeless numbers over there are skyrocketing.</p>

        <p>I think Rona lockdowns and remote schooling has been the worst for the “ghetto”
And under served communities. It’s been an endless summer since this began. How many kids won’t graduate high school now? How many parents lost their low end work or can’t afford to stay home with their kids all day? Those kids I feel the worse for and the media / main stream never talk about it. They are happy to see them all fail. At least I think so. They want an entire generation of welfare users who will always vote for the party who gives them the most “free” stuff</p>

        <p>yes it has, some of those kids, the main food they got for the day was through the school. Imagine being stuck at home all day with abusive parents or ones on drugs or being neglected, that's definitely happening. Probably plenty of suburban and middle class kids dealing with abuse. Teachers kept me going when I was a kid and gave me esteem and probably kept a lid on the abuse getting worse. Yeah they never talk about it. All of it is ignored. Remember the poorer live in far smaller places. Normal small apartments may be 500-700 square feet, I think mine is 700 or so, but we are talking 100 square feet or one room. Some people live in boarding houses or in crowded situations, where they live with relatives. Now imagine being holed up in that with no school, nothing to go to. The kids are losing valuable socialization, and education. One thing I kept thinking about is how many of these kids don't have internet access to keep "school" going. Free internet or even internet for the poor is a joke; what is internet now at least 80-90 a month for good high speed, think that's what I pay....People who are that poor are not going to own computers or newer computers too, that definitely affected the children's education and probably only one computer per household.</p>

        <p>I used to have an endless list of “friends”. I was extremely social and involved in the arts community. As soon as I started to question the narrative I was surprised to be considered an outcast (from a group of outcast)! Now I am so thankful to have 5 people in my life that I can have honest conversations with. I can’t imagine how hard it would be to not even be able to talk with your spouse about these things. I’m sorry for you and hope you find your people. With everything that is happening it might be beneficial for you to find people with some other common interest (art,books,gardening, cooking, or some hobby) and then see if you can find someone in that group who maybe is on the same path as you. Good luck.</p>

        <p>True, but there are online meetups. I am not someone who is really comfortable with technology but finally gave in and joined a community that has online meetups to discuss philosophy. Whatever your interest may be, if there isn’t a community yet, start one. It’s an uphill battle for sure, but not insurmountable. We find each other.</p>

        <p>That's true. I lived in an ultra-conservative area, speech did seem more free there. [the rural small town] Even as a disaffected liberal, I saw conservatives in different ways, I knew libertarians and others. For me the anti-authoritarianism comes first. There are conservatives here, this county is known as a "red one" for the state, but it will be the more rural areas around here.</p>

        <p>I have to say people don't really care that I didn't get the vax  ( i am in europe) but I have no friends left that haven't gotten it. They believe in the greater good so it seems. They don't even bothered to look anything up they just go and get it cause everyone is doing it and they want to travel. I just tell them I get it next year or maybe when the Sanofi one gets approved and than they get a bit anxious cause I seem to know allot about and not getting it while they got it and have no idea. I always end with saying that time will tell and that I hope I am wrong.</p>

        <p>Yes at this moment its still tolerated that we didn't got it. No idea when they are going to push it but looking at the rest off the world it won't be long anymore. I am discretely finding out who hasn't got it and how far they wanna go, cause truth is if we stick together I don't think  they can enforce it,we have staff shortage already and the government put extra money into healthcare so all senior homes are supposed to get more employees. I am very doubtful they can go and be picky.</p>

        <p>The best tactic right now is to try to wait it out, discourage people from complying too early, and the narrative and fear may peter out on it's own.</p>
<p>Its very hard isn't it? To care about people, but at the same time not doing stupid things that would endanger yourself at the same time.</p>
<p>At the least, no employer (and especially OUTSIDE of healthcare) should EVER have any jurisdiction or medical authority over their employees, or be allowed to COERCE them to do so.</p>
<p>The challenge is balancing safety and health issues vs the rights of the individual.. and in such clashes the only answer can be:<br>
Who is IMPOSING on who? and that should govern decisions on which side is in the right.</p>

<p>So even if people are out there on your side, there has been a chilling of free speech as a result. this can further drive people into thinking they are alone.</p>

        <p>Reach out online and find people who will understand and listen to your concerns. It must be a balance between people who understand your concerns, will still challenge you if you go too far down the rabbit hole, but also give you a friendly environment to work out your ideas and arguments. Finding an echo chamber is not good as it will make things worse,and you will not find alternate points of view.</p>
<p>There is also signs from your statements that a Narcissist is at work in your life, either directly, or by proxy (a friend) who is playing games and using Covid19 issues as a new and fun tool to manipulate others and pit them against each other. Research the signs of a Narcissist in your life, but beware - this is a rabbithole you cannot exit once you enter - and may disappoint you - but it can lead to better mental health in the future.</p>
<p>Signs of manipulation, or a presence of an NPD + his flying monkey minions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm told I'm nuts or insane, or made to feel my grip and interpretation of reality is false - even on things I know for sure are real.</li>
<li>I am isolated from my friends, or support systems, or a person in my life keeps stopping me from talking to people outside our circle</li>
<li>I feel like I am outnumbered, that I am the only one, and everyone is against me.</li>
<li>I walk on eggshells. It's better to stay quiet than to have a huge confrontation, or be yelled at and called stupid, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>b) Also related: "I have to be careful what I say" (walking on eggshells)</p>
<p>5) I'm not allowed to 'be myself' and I'm constantly being criticised, told I'm wrong, stupid, dumb, fearful or otherwise labeled or framed in a certain way that I know that I am not.</p>
<p>6) Triangulation: Very common, seeking allies to join an 'us vs YOU' block, could be family members, friends. Also a narcissist may be in the wings, influencing your relationship with someone close; pitting both of you against each other.</p>
<p><em>"I get the feeling the best friend is telling him I am "nuts"."</em></p>
<p>Stephen Molyneux, a youtuber based in philosophy told a story about how one of his friends was actively working to cause tension between him and his wife. Long story short, he got rid of the friend because he knew that he cannot have a successful and respectful and successful marriage with 'Grima Wormtongue' (LOTR) whispering in his ear.</p>
<p>I have seen this behaviour many times, on both side.. If it wasn't a friend, or would be suitor, or co-worker... I've literally seen poison tongues into the ear of one party, and have it manifest in relationships and marriages as a big wedge that inevitably destroyed them.</p>
<p>7) Hopefully  this is not happening to you, but I see it all the time:</p>
<p>Getting mad at you for discussing any issues you have, either in the home, personally, etc with outsiders...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Well you found a place where you can read, comment, vent and voice what's on your mind.</p>
<p>For the most part I have seen nothing but fair, honest, helpful and balanced responses here so far.</p>
<p>You are not alone,  and we are all under attack right now to make us feel alone, since by dividing all of us - by whatever way - they can conquer us.</p>

        <p>Yes I am going to try and reach out online and try and find local and other places too. I think an echo chamber can do damage too, well we see that in liberalism. They have crafted the divide and conquer stuff to the max haven't they?</p>
<p>I actually am no contact from a narcissistic/sociopathic dominant family and was an ACON, adult child of narcissists. I ended up having to change my whole life to end the whole thing, and having Covid happen just a few years after all this was a bad deal. </p>
<p>I am pretty well versed on narcissists but yes I think you are right and I have to be cautious.</p>
<p>I had to walk away from tons of people in healing from abuse. When I say sociopaths, I mean the hardest coldest types. Maybe this is why Covid has felt like too much to bear. Just too many losses.</p>
<p>To be frank one reason I see through this shit, is my ACON studies of gaslighting, use of proxy's, flying monkey's, double bind messages, full blown lying, acting superior and more. </p>
<p>I faced horrible invalidation for years. </p>
<p>It is one reason why I do not have the social and emotional supports most people have at my age. [outside of marriage] </p>
<p>So yes there is isolation left over from my former life. Add in my old small town--I didn't grow up there but moved there as a young adult, economically imploding.</p>
<p>Right before all this happened I was focused on "rebuilding" things. 
Your list was my entire life with the family, I even cut off friendships dating back to college. 
The way the best friend ignored my concerns bugged me. I also took the "it's your choice, very balanced approach" on purpose.</p>
<p>I was new to the research anyway but I think about that. I thought I and him were friends TOO but know we are not now.</p>
<p>With the family there were massive smear campaigns, and the rest. One top narcissist/sociopath turned everyone against me. Things were so bad they would send me checks for 1,000 dollars once I was no contact. I think games could still be played behind the scenes.
For the guy who told me off, saying I was crazy.....see above, some snobbish academic type, he doesn't know the half of it.</p>
<p>I know Fauci and all these assholes are like my family was.</p>
<p>Thanks for making me feel less alone.</p>
<p>I do wonder how many are being silent now, who are like me, scared of how everyone around them has become.</p>

        <p>It seems that you have spend a lifetime of associating with people you don't understand and now find out you don't really like.  That's one of the problems of not always being yourself.</p>
<p>Now is a good time to try to find people who think like you do, and you do like.  Get out there and do something about the problem you have.  And if this issue is something you can't talk to your SO about, then either don't... or leave.  Those are the choices.</p>
<p>And nobody is forcing you to wear a mask.  As far as I know, there are no "papers please" check stops (and if their are, stop going to those places).</p>

        <p>I’m in an area that is over 80% vaccinated, but I visited a store yesterday that had 99% of people wearing masks.</p>
<p>I literally don’t understand why fully vaccinated people are living in fear. For all their talk about “trusting the science” they can’t seem to do it themselves. It’s like people are living under mainstream media hypnosis.</p>
<p>I’m considering moving to a different part of America, I don’t relate to most people anymore.</p>

<p>A tele-health appointment with America's Frontline Doctors will get you access to ivermectin for humans.  $90 for the visit +$20 for the medicine.  Fit for human consumption.</p>

        <p>We are heading for hard times, and I mean the sort of hard times experienced by those who have suffered under political repression. It's easy to wonder how a society can fall to such an extent but it's precisely because the vast majority of people are utter cowards who will snitch on neighbours and even turn on their families for political and ideological reasons. </p>
<p>Avoid mainstream media, aside from being propaganda it's bad for your health and is designed to demoralise and alienate you. Use a VPN and network with other people, you would be surprised how many people think the same way as us but feel they can't talk openly. Unlike in soviet russia or maoist china we at least have avenues to network with other critical thinkers that the government cannot fully control. </p>

        <p>I think so too. I can see them rounding people up who question this and won't submit to the vaxx. We can see the brainwashing and acceptance of the worse. Right now things are at a stalemate, I keep thinking what will happen when the food is reduced, the internet is off and the eviction moratoriums are suspended? Just read that could be 9 million people displaced.  I will look into a VPN. I may join GAB or something like that to find others to speak with. I think Facebook is bad for my mental health too. There's a few I keep in contact with and one or two groups, so I have reduced time there. They are now tagging "your extremist friends". Don't think I got tagged yet, most of my posts were subtle, a few RJK posts or economic focused articles/the soul but that's reason alone to drop posting on there or leave. </p>
<p>I know I need real people outside of the internet. I am even thinking of moving, but can't talk husband into it. I've moved before and it improved life--the small rural town years before things imploded there.</p>

        <p>Your husband said, "If they take voting away, then it's game over."</p>
<p>I have a long-time friend who wrote me an email with a similar message.  He claims that if the Republican party gets all their "voter suppression" bills passed, it will literally be the end of the U.S. of A.  I had sent him a link to an 8-minute video about suppression of ivermectin information, and the conversation devolved from there.  </p>
<p>The media has done an incredible job with redirecting liberals' attention from the actual corruption of the Covid regime to the horror of Republicans rolling back universal vote-by-mail.  </p>
<p>They will believe anything that their TV tells them.</p>

        <p>I don't like what the Republicans are doing either with voter suppression, but what will votes mean, when they are doing things like suppression of ivermectin? [see my post from yesterday]Yes liberals are being redirected, it's horrifies me, they think this is all okay. I am realizing I can't talk to any about it, just a waste of time. I told him no voting is going to matter if this goes as bad as I think it is.</p>

        <p>All pretext of moderation and careful deliberation, or having more than a singular opinion of this issue is dead. Even stating "I think we needed to be careful with this virus and I'm glad we improved hospital capacity, but we need to admit the lockdowns caused a multitude of issues including many invisible ones that could be worse than the virus." Has cost me friend groups and had me labeled a nutjob, conspiracy freak, antivaxxer etc. Hell. I'm not even anti-vax. I think its a GOOD thing for informed people to get some sort of immunity to this thing so we don't have an even worse respiratory virus season every year. But even THAT stance has me on the outs with these people.</p>
<p>Believing in *informed consent* is a fringe right wing idea now. And you're right, you've been cut off. The effect of this social distancing, us-vs-them, mask wearing psychosis has been complete division and anger. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what idea terrifies me more, that the government is so incompetent that their inept response to this respiratory virus has caused everyone to fear or mistrust their neighbors, or consider them domestic terrorists. Or that they planned on *exactly* this.</p>

        <p>Yes like you, I didn't overload on people. I didn't come out with full guns blazing, saying I believe the vaxx is evil, etc etc. I said things like, "I don't trust new mRNA technology", "This has gone on for two years isn't it time to start asking questions. I was like you. A few I tried to warn or get them to question the vaxx, but that went badly and I was told I was "antiscience" and listening to "nutjobs" online. I have been called a anti-vaxxer too and it's completely inaccurate since I got two vaccines just acouple years ago, tetanus shot and a flu shot, so they lob names at you. Yeah informed consent is gone, probably with the whole ADA too. I am cut off, it's true. I know I think of both those scenarios too.....I lean towards they planned it.  :(</p>

        <p>Hell I got the full Pfeizer battery at work the day they were available. I've never had any side effects though the hit from the 2nd Pfeizer shot absolutely sucked for 2-3 days. But at that time I was working 12 hours shifts in a COVID ICU with a 5 week old N95 and a stroke survivor dad and 90+ year old grandmother to take care of. I think that the vaccines are reasonably safe, but I also think people should have the choice of what they put into their own bodies and deserve to be <em>informed</em> when they take it. </p>
<p>Telling people to take an experimental vaccine as the "personally responsible" thing to do is lunacy. Especially if the person telling you to do so is overweight in any way. The stats are in. 60% more likely to require intubation for COVID if you're obese. So I guess we just don't care about hospital capacity now? How about nurses getting hurt rolling and turning your fat ass? Putting down the ice cream is a BETTER start than trusting a one off little shot.</p>

<p>Makes me glad my wife and I are on the same page. My main concern is my elderly mother who is stressed out because I don't want to take the vaccine. To the point where I've cut down on speaking to her, since many conversations have become heated. I have no problem with her getting vaccinated. And from my side, I'd just agree to disagree, and forget about it. I don't blame her though, but I do blame the media.</p>

        <p>Im in the same boat. My mom and brother have always blindly trusted the mainstream media so i knew they would fall hard fir this narrative. But my dad has been the conspiracy theory type who never trusted the government, out of everyone I thought he would keep his sanity through all this. Boy was I ever wrong. Even when the holidays cam he was still telling me to wear a mask and stay six feet away, before that was just no visiting at all. My grandma is the only sane person left in my life. For the first few months i couldn't even see her though because she was in the hospital with knee replacement surgery. </p>
<p>I get how you feel. If your husband or friends treat you like your crazy then cut them out of your life. It actually feels more lonely being in a group of people who don't understand you than it is to be by yourself. If you're able to avoid those topics completely and not forced to wear a mask than it's fine. But if they single you out or constantly bring up the topic or covid or the "vaccines" with the result of you being singled out then stop seeing them. Your mental health is just as important as your physical health and if you can't find any REAL friends around you than you should consider moving. Im seriously considering the same thing. Im tired to being afraid that i will be fired for refusing to take experimental drugs, I'm tired of everyone around me being covid cultists.</p>

        <p>That's too bad you are in the same boat. Too bad about your Dad, it seems most conspiracy theory people would see through this crap since some of it was warned of even 20 years ago.  Hope your grandmother is doing better. Yes I don't want people around me who treat me like I am crazy. It does feel more lonely to be in a group of people who don't understand me. With husband I am not sure how things will go, need to find out if people are putting bugs in his ear about me. I worry about the invalidation I am feeling.  I am avoiding the Covid topic IRL, for few I talk to on Zooms etc. So far only singled out a little bit, but hoping it doesn't happen. Parading into a room of 40 vaxxed people being forced to wear a mask sucks. Yeah I consider moving because I can't find real friends, I stayed here for the better medical resources but I wonder, have felt off for a long time. Hope you are able to make your own choices too. You should not be forced to worry for your job or livelihood at the expense of your life or health, the fact they have done this people is evil. Yes I am tired of everyone being covid cultists too. All the vaxxed are living in fear still it's weird. Won't even meet with each other in buildings, that will be interesting when winter is here.</p>

        <p>Thank you, my grandma is doing much better. I slept over at her place for the first couple days after she returned from the hospital so that i could help her with rehab and to get up at night if needed.  </p>
<p>I worry about everyone in our position where we are surrounded by covid cultists. Just be on the look out for gas lighting, for slowly being dragged into believing what they are telling you. You're not insane, you have looked at the facts and have come to a reasonable conclusion.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry this happening to you. I was in a marriage like this for 34 years. My advice is just be quiet and do what you need to do. Buy extra, say you stocked up because it was on sale, do your research quietly, just say you are not comfortable getting the vaccine. A BIG gentle hug for you....</p>

        <p>Thanks. I am worried about where things are going, I truly am. I am very disabled and I know more dependent on my husband than many women would be too. I am going to do for myself just like you say, get stocked up, I will go to gardening/feed place too [to get my bean lattice but look for other things], to find what I can, do research quietly. I won't talk about politics with him, because that's only going to cause problems. Thanks for the hug.</p>

        <p>Ivermectin is cheap. Get it on Amazon. I always take into account that it is better  to be prepared than unprepared. Maybe, it is conspiracy, maybe it is not. At least taking some precautions will ease your worries. Look up mms water purifier.  I figure that can be used as well. If it all goes to hell you will have some tools. Either way, I just go about my business. I do not tell people whether I am vaxxed or not. But honestly the spike protein shedders got me the most worried and I still wear a mask in public for that reason  and so do most around me. I do not know why they do, but I entertain the thought that they are not vaxxed. I also drink Star Anise every night. 
I am not worried about whether doom happens or not. But I do what I can, just incase there is truth to it. No one needs to know. I do not care what people think, but I do not talk to others about it. Many will ask if I have been vaxxed and I always reply, " Haven't you?".</p>

        <p>If they? They have, it's been game over for awhile now if that's the case.</p>
<p>I have barely any real friends left, all divided over something or other or just work in general from getting older (30s). I don't use facebook except to verify I'm a real person to employers. But I'm ok with being alone with my hobbies, it'd be nice to have like-minded friends though. Sorry about your online friend though. This sub is nice support, I hope we don't lose it. I've talked about things with people who seemed like they were onboard only to watch them turn around and do the opposite enough times to not trust anyone really.

        <p>Yeah agree. That's too bad you are without real friends too, the division is hard. In real life, I did stop talking about certain topics to keep peace, with the soul post, I won't argue. All the strife is not worth it. I enjoy my hobbies too, I hope we don't lose this board too.  Yes I have seen the "turn around" people who seemed gung ho against it, but who flipped over. The only thing I can fathom is that the peer pressure got to them, or they were threatened with being fired from a job, or got tired of feeling on the outs.</p>

Aunt, uncle, mom, brother, one friend(other friends are going down with the clowns unfortunately). My dad is the only one left remaining who has been indoctrinated from the military for 23 years, but we’ve been slowly dripping truth on him and he’s coming around. When it comes to online, everyone besides the truth community and this sub are united. The rest of the world seems absolutely screwed. I stopped trying to wake sheep up, if they aren’t by now. They most likely will never be and that’s sad. Also, I couldn’t imagine having a partner that isn’t awake to everything. I would LOSE IT. I’m sorry and I pray that situation goes in a good direction.</p>

        <p>I am glad you have all that support. If I was going to talk in my old fundamentalist Christian way, "my family is of the world completely and united to the system". I am glad you are trying to wake up your father. With husband, I am going to try to talk to him more. I have him seeing a few things, but it's tiring. He's all I have and if these other people influence him, I am going to be in for a world of hurt. Thanks for understanding the loneliness of it all.  The world seems screwed to me too.</p>

        <p>That’s the worst part by far, loneliness. It’s immensely saddening on some days. Feeling like the world is just sleeping until sudden destruction comes upon them. I have worldly friends and they drive me insane some days. Like they will intentionally provoke me about serious topics just to mess with me. I have to legit buck on them. I pray your husband comes around. Having a support system and someone who’s that close to you would mean the world if y’all were on the same wavelength. I would literally feel like the luckiest guy in the world if I had a partner who was awake like me. Definitely a God send blessing imo.</p>

        <p>I am so sorry to hear that you feel so alone. I completely understand how you're feeling. Stay strong!!!</p>
<p>These days, I also feel quite alone. Most people who were close to me think I'm insane and refuse to acknowledge anything I have to say on the subject. They all 'don't have time' for this. Most raced out for their vaccines, even after expressing some hesitancy...the pressure hit them. They've had side effects that they won't acknowledge are related to the vaccine (general feeling unwell, missing or unusual menstrual cycles, pain at injection site weeks afterwards etc ...) and everyone else around them is assisting in justifying the unusual happenings. Including doctors on their social media profiles. For these friends, I have given up and distanced myself. I know I am not alone and although there aren't many people physically near me who are on the same page, I know they're there.</p>

        <p>Thank you. It helps to know and talk to others who relate. Yes the ones I know literally raced to get it. Didn't even have time for thinking it out or warning anyone with a group of them. Many look sicker but the social pressure is, they would never blame the vaxx, and older people [I am in my 50s]they can make excuses that was a health problem they are getting from aging for the more slow building up stuff. I have seen the posts enough to hear the justifications, even months worth of messed up periods. I understand distancing yourself. I see people on Zooms and do activities there, but distanced from the real gung ho types.</p>

        <p>It's crazy to me. I can't comprehend why so many people think it's unreasonable to be weary or uncomfortable with this new medical tech. It's literally brand new. Never used on the masses until right now. Science isn't perfect and history shows us that it's constantly evolving and we don't always get it right. I see too much creation of confusion with conflicting media, which makes me continue to question things. </p>
<p>As long as we still have the freedom to say 'no thanks', we'll be alright. But the massive societal push for it is daunting. The name calling and blame being thrown upon unvaccinated is not right. Nobody should be made to feel guilty about the decisions they make for their bodies.</p>

        <p>This is what I did. I live alone and all of my neighbors and friends completely fell for the mind control. I was feeling extremely lonely and isolated. At the same time, I was following and gaining new dissident friends on social media, so I started noting who lived in my area. Then I invited them all to a picnic. That was last fall. January was my birthday, and I was determined to have a party, so I invited a couple I met at the picnic and some newer friends I'd met online. It was the best Bday ever, and now we meet up once a month to de-burden ourselves of stress and speak freely with like minded folk. We may not ultimately become besties, but being able to socialize like this has been an absolute life saver.</p>
<p>Hang in there, I wish you well in all things.</p>

        <p>People just can't face what's happened. Theres been too much suffering for it to be all for nothing. 
If you ever need a chat OP feel free to DM me. I'm lucky that my husband does agree to some extent. But for the more insane stuff he doesn't quite believe me.</p>

        <p>I'm in that position, husband agrees to some extent, I convinced him the vaxxes were killing and harming people, but yes the more "insane" stuff or "conspiracy" stuff he is struggling with. Thanks for offer on DM too. Hope both our husbands realize the full picture.</p>

        <p>I use Peanut to meet local moms. Anyone who was willing to meet up during this was automatically less crazy than a typical Californian. I think Bumble is the equivalent for people who don’t have kids. </p>
<p>But aside from apps it’s helpful to work on striking up conversations with people who you see out and about and maskless. It’s self selecting for people who aren’t still too scared. Its an easy entry point of conversation to joke around or say it’s so nice to see a friendly face around here.</p>

        <p>&rt;Does anyone here have no one to talk to in real life?</p>
<p>Join the club, sister. Really sorry you're having to go through this hellscape. Given the regime ruling "my" state, I'm basically living the prequel to a zombie movie, but the state dictator and his minions are actively against me too.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>I also fear reprisals as they blame "variants" on the unvaxxed. This</strong> <br>
<strong>stuff is heavy and impacting real lives. Don't brush off the effects of</strong> <br>
<strong>their psychological warfare on people.</strong></p>
<p>Again, same here. Truth is, I'm actually more afraid of this than our dictator's minions or Pedo Joe's Gestapo beings sent for me. You know exactly how people behave in mob violence situations.</p>
<p>To paraphrase a fellow "crazy conspiracy theorist" of mine from totally-not-zombie media who happened to be right, I know the system in these parts is corrupt and evil, but it's at least predictable. The people are the ones who scare me.</p>

        <p>IRL? My mother, really. My husband sounds like yours.  Only mine already had one of the mRNA vaccines. </p>
<p>I'm pretty much disgusted by a lot of people on Facebook. People that, before covid, I thought were ok.  I stopped going on there again. </p>
<p>How I get around the prepping issue is by canning foods and gardening. My husband likes that it's old timey and doesn't think too much about it.</p>
<p>I've also been prepping stuff like rice and beans, but I got my mother on board with it and we do it together  when I go visit. Vaccum sealing 100lbs of white rice at a time in mylar bags goes really quick.  Same goes for vacuum sealing beans.  </p>
<p>She doesn't want to hear too much about where I see things going, but she agrees that it's good to have an insurance policy. She thinks we've done a lot, but I think of all the mouths we have to feed and... it's really not as much as she thinks it is.</p>
<p>Next up we're going to be dehydrating fruits and vegetables, making trail mix, etc.</p>
<p>I also plan on learning how to ferment foods. I'll probably start with pickles or homemade vinegar. </p>
<p>I've always played some of my cards tight to my chest with people, so I've been fine with doing that with our close friends. We never really talked about politics or current events anyway. They haven't even asked if I was vaccinated.  I figure I may as well enjoy their company before the eventual dark winter.  </p>
<p>If you need someone to chat with, you can message me.  It sounds like we have a lot in common. I'm in my forties, married, no kids.  I don't believe in the political paradigm. It's like Plato's Allegory of the Cave - that's all shadows on the cave wall.</p>
<p>We were chatting a couple weeks ago about the situation with the papacy, Fatima, whether it's the end times, etc.  Another friend, somehow we got started on the 3 days of darkness. I think I might be revising my opinion on if this is the actual end. Earlier I was saying it's a prefigurement, but that's because there's a period of peace ahead.  It's only about 25 years.  The actual Antichrist would come sometime after that.  So yeah, we could still be in the actual end times - this is the minor chastisement.  Just the second coming still might not be during our lifetime, probably. </p>
<p>(Of course, now I want to re-listen to this really good bible study on the book of Revelation/Apocalypse: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnftOVqh-jlZIKgatk6uEi4l7hdXTmTHM )</p>
<p>If you're interested, this is what caused me to revise my opinion:

        <p>Sorry to hear your mother or husband got the vaxx.</p>
<p>Yeah I am disgusted by a lot of people, trying to avoid arguments. I did reach out to one who lives long distance, that showed signs of independent thought. Will see if I get an answer.</p>
<p>I don't have any land to garden not even a patio, but am gardening a bit off site....but learning how to do it as much as I can. Yeah a lot of people garden and can now so glad you can do this. That's great your mother helps too.
At least she sees the importance of prepping, too bad you have to restrain some talk.
Yeah enjoy your friends, I am avoiding the topic with many now, not bringing up blog to ones who do know where it is. Thanks for suggestions to chat. 
I am glad you see through the political paradigm. Well when I had the conspiracy blog during fundamentalist Christian years, I definitely did, I tried to return to "normal world" and like trying to shoehorn something that's not going to work. I do have some progressive beliefs but nothing progressive about fascists who want total control on either side. </p>
<p>I have met fundamentalist Christians who have preached about three days of darkness, I remember the Catholic version. Think you have to light candles or something. Not sure. 
Some believe history is cyclical, endless beginnings and ends. Strauss and Howe say the FOURTH TURNING is due, 80-100 year cycles of things being good and going bad..I know I wish I knew if this "was the end" or not.</p>

        <p>It was my husband who took the vax. :(</p>
<p>Whether it's the end or not shouldn't matter.  Either way, this life is a probation - whether you die in a state of grace or not determines whether you spend eternity in the Kingdom of Heaven or if you're separated from God for eternity. The important things are to put a priority on what God wants, keep the divine and natural law, do your duty.</p>
<p>Though, we were also told to read the signs of the times. So definitely can't hurt.</p>
<p>I think the next decade is going to be rough. Ever hear about that vision Pope Leo XIII had, where the devil basically bragged about how much damage he'd done to the Church (In one of the accounts I get the impression he was referring dividing the Church  with protestantism.) and asked for more time and more power so he could completly destroy the Church?  It was basically like in Job, where the devil claimed Job only loved God so much because He'd been good to him. So, the devil asked for permission to attack Job.  God gives permission, and so the test began.  That's what's been going on - Satan is let loose 50 to 60 years before the year 2000, according to the Pope’s vision in 1886.  And a bunch more demons were let loose decades prior to prepare the way.  (Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich also had a similar vision years earlier.)  Anyway,  I'm sure they attacked more than just the Church, but also society. </p>
<p>Anyway, this is what caused Pope Leo XIII to draft the St. Micheal prayer and have us say it at the end of every mass.  (It was sometime in the 1960s, I think, when it was decided to only be optional, but the Pope still urged it to be said.)  Where I go still says it.  Our parish has the largest Catholic school system in the state - sometimes I wonder if it's from exactly that.</p>
<p>Dr. Taylor Marshall, a former Anglican priest who converted to Catholicism, (he also wrote a book about the infiltration of the Catholic Church - it has a forward written by a bishop and Dr. Marshall handed a copy personally to the Pope - the video is online) did a recent 16 minute video on the topic, if you're interested: https://youtu.be/K9Gm28QLT5w</p>
<p>With the 3 days of darkness,  yes, you need the blessed beeswax candles. They're something Catholics tend to have on hand, anyway. And the home where you take shelter should be of someone in the state of grace or the candle won't light.  Don't look out the windows or open the doors or you'll die.  We're also told to keep a crucifix close and wear sacramentals. The house will probably shake and you'll hear terrible noises.  The 3 days of darkness will be something we'll have some notice of, from what I can tell.</p>
<p>Though the decade will be rough, I've been wondering if we'll see the reunification of Christians, because of the warning.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry to hear. If it makes any difference you’re not alone. It’s better to meet with like minded people than to argue with people who don’t get it. It’s too late for a lot of people. If they don’t get it now it’s because they don’t want to. I would get more into the medical freedom movement and make some new friends. The fight is happening. I’ve met more people like this in recent months and it definitely helps.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying you deserve this at all, God that would be horrible! I'm saying that if everyone is pulling away from you and it seems like it cannot be explained, if you feel like you're not being accepted and do not belong and so on then you also need to take a honest and deep look at yourself to see what could explain it. Personally, based on your story here, I can see it. But now the most important thing is that you can see it too, ASAP, before things in your life get even worse in terms of mental health, your relationships and so on. </p>

        <p>I have done that, and I've done counseling before [no personality disorders or whatever you are trying to lob at me] for internet jollies.Honestly telling me "you suck, and are broken" is not helpful here. </p>
<p>you seriously can look at society now and tell me it has not gone crazy? maybe you are the mad one and I am the sane one. Maybe we all have been driven crazy.</p>
<p>With the counselors, they will tell me to get the jab and conform, and that everything I think is wrong and I need to be a good little obedient woman and submit to the program.</p>

        <p>I'm not lobbing anything at you, again your attitude here is quite telling. I'm not telling you you suck at all, or are broken. I am not attacking you. What I can tell you is that your view of the world can hugely impact how you interact with it and in turn how others interact with you, or - indeed - decide to refuse to interact with you.</p>
<p>I won't disagree that society is going through a turbulent time, but we all have different ways and means of assessing and interpreting these changes. If how I feel qualifies as crazy then crazy is much better than it sounds. Again, how you view the world + how you deal with it is vital if you ask me.</p>

        <p>Maybe, but it is very common for the victim to sound like the abuser in their life, and the abuser will wage a smear campaign against his victim in order to gain allies, and the 'majority' behind them/her</p>

        <p>Narcissist in my life, due to their manipulatory powers, would be seen by everyone else in your life as 'being the nice guy', very gregarious, outgoing, etc But when it came to their own family and social circle had a much different face.</p>
<p>So when you realize this,and escape it, and if you talk to anyone else about it, YOU are the one who sounds hateful, YOU are the one that sounds like you're smearing this person, etc - especially if out of anger you outline every offense etc..</p>
<p>So if the people outside this isolating circle know this individual, who to THEM seems so happy, carefree and friendly - they will look at YOU as the person who is nuts or smearing that person :D The narcissist is perfectly happy to stand by and let you hang yourself :D</p>
<p>While you may publicly 'smear' them and look like the jerk yourself in doing so, their smearing happens WITHOUT your presence and behind your back and they are even willing to LIE and fabricate things to make you look like the abuser and they the victim..</p>
<p>This is why it can be so damn confusing LOL. The natural urge of course is to defend yourself, or to talk to a friend and outline all the crimes that were dealt against you, etc - but the only people they see shit-talking is  YOU!</p>
<p>So yeah confusing lol. We have to be careful then to not make judgements until further information can be gathered...</p>
<p>Even worse.. is if a victim, in wanting to get their anger and frustration off their chest, and just wanting others to understand and make sure they're not crazy (which is the flag of a victim, not the NPD themself) - <em>No NPD ever says or asks "Am I crazy?"</em> Impossible for them -</p>
<p>and run into another NPD they confide to? YIKES</p>
