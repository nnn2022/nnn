    <strong>My aunt is about to pass away. She's in hospice now.</strong>
    <p><p>I just got off the phone with my dad,  trying to explain my concerns about her getting vaccinated and how there's a connection to her lung cancer.  He told me there's no connection,  that that's just an "old wives tale" or something,  and I explained how it is kind of strange how she progressed to stage 4 lung cancer in only 2 months.  He said she could have had it for months and it just went undetected.  And he went on about delta variant, how dangerous it is to be unvaxxed, that people are dying only .1% and any adverse reactions are minor and nothing to worry about.  I tried to explain to him how untrue this is.  And I'm going on.  And he's like I can give you the number to my friends immunologist. And after a while of me going on, he's like I'm not a scientist so I don't have answers for you.  But you should talk to that immunology, he can give you better answers. </p>
<p>My cousin is a medical malpractice lawyer and she's taking care of my aunt.  I find it so absurd that she isn't seeing the connection.  I asked her if my aunt got the vaccine,  she said yup she was one of the first ones,  waited in line for 2 hours.  But it's not covid related. </p>
<p>I love how she just assumes I'm taking about covid and not the vaccine. </p>
<p>Even my sister texted today "I can't believe how fast her cancer has progressed.  Is there anything we can do"</p>
<p>But nobody wants to listen to me or take me seriously when I try to tell them how questionable the vaccine is and how questionable the entire thing is. </p>
<p>I told my dad they keep changing the rules and his response is that they are catering to the change in the variants, because covid is so unpredictable.</p>
<p>I think I'll be met with this same argument every time someone in my family tries to talk to me about getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>I live in a blue state in the US. Right by Washington DC.  My mom has Biden signs and BLM signs in the front yard.  </p>
<p>I can't win.</p></p>
