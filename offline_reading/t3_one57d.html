    <strong>For those suffering from long haul, there is evidence that covid causes long term inflammation and there is evidence that Ivermectin and Fluvoxamine can help</strong>
    <p><p>The idea seems to be that your body still has viral proteins floating around, even after you've killed the virus. These virus bits cause problems by interacting with your cells in harmful ways. This interaction causes inflammation in places that can cause at least some of the symptoms of long haul.</p>
<p>These three articles point to evidence that the spike protein crosses the blood brain barrier and causes inflammation throughout the body:</p>
<p>Article on how the Covid19 spike protein crosses the blood-brain barrier:

<p>Article on how the spike protein can cause neurodegeneration:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006291X2100499X?via%3Dihub</p>
<p>Covid leads to long term inflammation:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33391730/ </p>
<p>These four articles explain how Ivermectin binds to the spike protein and has anti-inflammatory properties:</p>
<p>Meta-analysis on the efficacy of Ivermectin in treating Covid19:
https://journals.lww.com/americantherapeutics/Abstract/9000/Ivermectin_for_Prevention_and_Treatment_of.98040.aspx</p>
<p>Ivermectin stops replication of covid:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011 </p>
<p>Ivermectin has anti-viral properties:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3888155/ </p>
<p>Ivermectin has anti-viral properties against covid:
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41429-020-0336-z</p>
<p>These three articles explain how Fluvoxamine acts on the sigma-1 receptor inside your cells to reduce inflammation inside your body and brain. It also blocks viral protiens from interacting with the sigma-1:</p>
<p>Fluvoxamine helps in covid treatment:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33180097/ </p>
<p>Fluvoxamine has anti-inflammatory properties that can help treat covid:
https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.652688/full</p>
<p>Fluvoxamine targets sigma-1 to stop covid replication:

<p>I am personally following the FLCCC iRecover protocol with great success. My lung capacity has returned, I feel energetic, motivated, and clear minded again. I still have 4 weeks to go with the protocol, so hopefully it will be a permanent change. There is hope my friends.</p>
<p>I will link it here for those who are curious:
