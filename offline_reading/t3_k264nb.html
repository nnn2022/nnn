<p>Tweet announcement from them saying they removed it.</p>
<p>The internet always remembers. This isn’t some conspiracy theorist saying this. Johns Hopkins is a respected university and I imagine this person who wrote the analysis is very intelligent.</p>

        <p>If you look at this from another perspective it can be interpreted as a bit of sophisticated propaganda jiu-jitsu.  </p>
<p>Release a completely reasonable statistical analysis from a major, well-respected university with one of the top SPHs.  Retract a day or two later.  Now when anybody cites these same statistics the inevitable reaction will be "JHU retracted those stats!"</p>
<p>It's almost like an immune response after vaccination.</p>

        <p>Their reason for retraction was vague and unconvincing as well. . It didn’t say “this was faulty logic” or “this is wrong”. I wouldn’t have been as quick to dig into it if they had some really in depth refusal describing its stats errors or something.</p>
<p>Edit: Ok 13 minutes ago they put up another statement: https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19</p>
<p>Still unconvincing and a bunch of fluff IMO.</p>

        <p>&rt; After retrieving data on the CDC website, Briand compiled a graph representing percentages of total deaths per age category from early February to early September, which includes the period from before COVID-19 was detected in the U.S. to after infection rates soared. </p>
<p>&rt; Surprisingly, the deaths of older people stayed the same before and after COVID-19. Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same. </p>
<p>&rt; “The reason we have a higher number of reported COVID-19 deaths among older individuals than younger individuals is simply because every day in the U.S. older individuals die in higher numbers than younger individuals,” Briand said.</p>
<p>&rt; Briand also noted that 50,000 to 70,000 deaths are seen both before and after COVID-19, indicating that this number of deaths was normal long before COVID-19 emerged. Therefore, according to Briand, not only has COVID-19 had no effect on the percentage of deaths of older people, but it has also not increased the total number of deaths.</p>

        <p>It’s funny because according to doomers every single thing that suggests it’s not as bad as CNN says is a “shit analysis” and a “shoddy study”. Seems they only worship “science” when they agree with it.</p>

        <p>The article was clumsily written and implied claims Brieand didn't really make.  There's obviously excess mortality this year - maybe 10% or so a third of which is due to lockdowns.  Her point was that excess week by week wasn't far off the 2018 flu peaks.</p>
<p>Her presentation (still available on YouTube, btw) focuses most of its time on other areas, namely the lack of changes in ratios of death by age group pre-covid to now and to the counter-intuitive dip in deaths from other health-related causes like heart disease that typically rise along side influenza spikes.</p>
<p>She didn't postulate on causes, just made observations.</p>

        <p>I actually am planning to download her video and watch it myself. It’s about a hour. </p>
<p>Learned to do that after reading a political article then watching the actual senate floor debate and having it be totally different than I imagined. </p>
<p>I’m going to check it out.</p>
