    <strong>Even in civil conversation the brainwashing is rampant</strong>
    <p><p>So I was talking to a brother today after church. The conversation went to how lepers would self isolate until declared clean by the priest.</p>
<p>I couldn't explain to him how the current situation is the exact opposite, where the high priest of the CDC (equivalent) declare everyone unclean symptoms or not, and will only declare you clean when you have had your shots.</p>
<p>How do we ring through to seemingly reasonable people that the situation right now is <em>not</em> similar to those from history?</p></p>

        <p>The Old Testament treatment of lepers and the ritually unclean was totally repudiated by Jesus Christ. Jesus embraced lepers and healed them. He rebuked the squeamishness of the priests. As Christians, we live in grace. We don't need to worry about picayune rules and loopholes thanks to the ultimate sacrifice of our redeemer. The law has been fulfilled and we've all been given forgiveness for our human failings.</p>

<p>Thank the Lord that I don't deal with this unbelief in our church (BTW, it's a super illegal super-spreader underground church here in Europe).</p>
<p>To answer this person, simply ask them if Jesus and the disciples ever quarantined themselves after touching and interacting with lepers.   </p>
<p>&rt; How do we ring through to seemingly reasonable people that the situation right now is <em>not</em> similar to those from history? </p>
<p>I can't relate in real life because my church has been anti-NN from the onset, but I have been overwhelmed by this on the Christian subs. Honestly, people neither read nor believe the Bible - those who read it only have an intellectual knowledge of it and not an actual belief in what it says.</p>
<p>At least you still have legal, in-person church and that your church wasn't closed down by the leaders to be turned into a vaxx centre!</p>

<p>Nice! In in the Netherlands (hence the CDC equivalent, we call it RIVM/GGD). Care to share where you are located?</p>

<p>The elders shut down prayer circle and Bible circle, they only allow Sunday morning worship with up to 30 "visitors", no singing, no coffee, the "worship team" needs to test negative before the service. I wish they were more lenient. ðŸ˜«</p>

<p>Netherlands turned into a dystopia seemingly overnight and is now unrecognisable. The most disappointing thing that has come out of this PaNdEmIc has been Christians swearing fealty to the state.</p>

<p>No, evangelical, though my Bible circle leader "accused" me of being very reformed in my theology. ðŸ˜¬</p>
<p>&rt;Netherlands turned into a dystopia seemingly overnight and is now unrecognisable.</p>
<p>It's always easier to see those changes from a distance. Inhowfar has the Netherlands changed significantly different than say Germany, France, or Spain has?</p>
<p>&rt;Is the government regulating churches, or are the churches doing it by themselves to be super safe?</p>
<p>Like always in the Netherlands: a bit of both. The govt "strongly encourages" for churches to go safe, the Protestant Church Netherlands (PKN) has made a protocol for 30 "visitors" max. Our church is under a different and more loose umbrella (VPE) but decided to act in accordance to the PKN protocol.</p>
<p>There are a few churches that do not follow the guidance, and they have had quite some news attention (negatively, of course).</p>

        <p>It's a lovely place except for June, July, August and September when it's terribly hot and humid. I am glad that you honeymooned here.</p>
<p>The Dutch Reformed that we have in southern Africa (where I am from) is actually more Pentecostal. I guess it just depends with the pastor. I must say that I know the least about the Netherlands because I don't speak Dutch, but I do speak F/G/S and must say that Germany looks worse than the Netherlands (from what I hear on independent, non-state radio stations). </p>
<p>Honestly, it just sucks to have churches living in fear and doing even MORE than is necessary whilst simultaneously stifling their own members' spiritual growth. </p>
<p>Yeah, Dutch media is astonishingly left-wing and anti-Christian. I used to watch dubbed content from NOS, RTL and BVN when I once considered learning the language (spoiler: chose German instead) and noticed the strong bias.</p>

<p>Amen. Typically Dutch to be the good kid, but it's seriously unhealthy!</p>
<p>Matthew 10:28 â€” <em>And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</em></p>
<p>&rt;Dutch media is astonishingly left-wing and anti-Christian.</p>
<p>Totally. Even the state owned NOS is seriously biased, to the point of it being a propaganda channel for the govt.</p>
<p>I was kicked from /r/Netherlands because I accused the NOS of lying in our faces about a year back. After the third outbreak in a meat factory the question arose how safe the meat is to eat. The journalist said the virus would die in seconds on the meat so there is no health risk. Sure, but why then am I instructed to wash my hands whenever possible to avoid infecting myself when touching my face? Which of these two was the lie? Apparently even asking this question was worth silencing me...</p>

<p>NOS is outrageous. I remember how they even tried to engage in historical revisionism by making it seem like Zwarte Piet was a racist thing when the tradition predates the Dutch colonial empire. NOS literally hates the Netherlands and its culture. </p>
