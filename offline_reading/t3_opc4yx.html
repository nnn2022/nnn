    <strong>One hundred years of epidemic scams</strong>
    <p><p>As is well known, the "Spanish flu" bypassed revolutionary Russia.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The most obvious explanation for this is that the Bolshevik government simply had no reason to deceive the country's population with a made-up epidemic.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It looks like the possible cause of the condition, dubbed "Spanish flu", was mechanical damage of the mucous membrane of tons of people as a result of chemical attacks, the first mass occurance of which was precisely in WWI. Why do people catch colds and flu en masse during the cold season, why are these seasonal diseases? Because hypothermia destroys mucous membranes and the germs that live in our nose and throat on a regular basis simply take advantage of the situation (for more detail, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzGxKTzuDv0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzGxKTzuDv0</a>).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The so-called "Spanish flu" is known for killing mostly young people. This peculiarity has not yet been unequivocally explained by virologists. Well, who sat in the trenches of World War I? Mostly young men. They were deliberately sent into the meat grinder because young men and young people in general are most dangerous during a revolutionary uprising. For example, there were about 250,000 boys under 18 in the British army. (Source - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29934965">https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29934965</a>). They were the ones who became the victims of chemical attacks (combined with malnutrition, hypothermia, stress, unsanitary conditions etc). In addition, tear gas was actively used, for example, by American police to suppress workers' protests and disperse workers' meetings.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But capitalists had to abruptly wrap up the whole "flu" hysteria, because they had the fight against the socialist revolution and the intervention of 1918-1921 on their agenda.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It wasn't until the 1970s that the capitalists resumed their large-scale epidemic scams. In 1973 an energy crisis of colossal proportions began in the capitalist world, joined by a crisis of overproduction in heavy industry. It was at this point that the "Rust Belt" of the U.S., formerly the "Factory Belt" or "Industrial Belt", a depopulated region where decay and drug addiction now reign, began to emerge. Before the 1970s it was the centre of American heavy industry. Due to the sales crisis, in an attempt to save their profits, capitalists closed hundreds of plants and factories there and moved production to places with cheaper labour. Hundreds of thousands of people lost their sources of livelihood.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This was the second crisis of the capitalist system accompanied by an epidemic of a "deadly virus". In 1976 a campaign was launched in the USA for universal vaccination against swine flu, which, according to "scientists", was expected to kill one million Americans. Source - <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/long-shadow-1976-swine-flu-vaccine-fiasco-180961994/">https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/long-shadow-1976-swine-flu-vaccine-fiasco-180961994/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Quote.... "To avoid an epidemic, the CDC believed, at least 80 percent of the United States population would need to be vaccinated...." "This all happened in the spring, with emergency legislation for the “National Swine Flu Immunization Program,” being signed into effect in mid-April. By the time immunizations began on October 1, though, the proposed epidemic had failed to emerge...". "Epidemiology takes time, politics is often about looking like you’re doing something and logistics between branches of government are extremely complicated. These factors all contributed to the pandemic that never was." (Actually, as we understand it, entirely different factors contributed here, namely the search for new sources of profit at a time of deep capitalist crisis, the need to divert the attention of the masses, the need for banning mass gatherings and workers' meetings, etc.) "The real victims of this pandemic were likely the 450-odd people who came down with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder, after getting the 1976 flu shot..."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>----------------------------—</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Apparently, back then, the American public, thanks to the improvements in education and living standards (arising from the need to compete with Soviet socialism), was able to quickly discern the contradictions in what was happening and began to express serious discontent. And public discontent at a time of confrontation between the two systems could have backfired on the American capitalists, especially when combined with production cuts and a wave of impoverishment.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The scam had to be quickly shut down once again.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Incidentally, it is possible that the figure of 450 people suffering from neurological disorders after the "vaccination" is an underestimate. The same thing is happening now - some people are suffering serious neurological disorders after the "jab". One bourgeois virologist, Suharit Bhakdi, has suggested that this is due to blood clots forming in the brain (source - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyPjAfNNA-U&amp;t=1561s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyPjAfNNA-U&amp;t=1561s</a>).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In the 1980s, when capitalist production finally came to a standstill and was on the verge of another revolutionary upsurge (remember the miners' strike in the UK and the wave of protests and strikes in the US, for example), a new pandemic emerges - AIDs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>After the destruction of the USSR, capitalists have somewhat improved their financial situation, but not for long. Soon the world began to be literally overwhelmed by viral epidemics. Ever since, there has been a deadly virus almost every year (for more detail, see "Virusmania" by Klaus Koehnlein).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And then 2019 arrived. Yet another collapse of the capitalist mode of production, yet another gigantic crisis of overproduction and yet another world protest wave - again accompanied by a "deadly virus" and "mathematical forecasts" of millions of victims (for more detail, see <a href="https://work-way.com/en/2021/03/15/exploring-the-global-crisis-blamed-on-the-fake-pandemic/">https://work-way.com/en/2021/03/15/exploring-the-global-crisis-blamed-on-the-fake-pandemic/</a>)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The question is, how long will this go on? The answer is simple - as long as the working class and other workers en masse trust bourgeois science and media. This trust in the masses is directly proportional to the economic situation (which is why the current protest wave is led by small and medium capital, destroyed by big capital under the pretext of "anti-virus measures"). It follows that the scams with deadly epidemics (including their "cyber" variations) are nothing more than a postponement of open class confrontation - the crisis of capitalist economy is getting deeper and more insurmountable and capital will not be able to keep the working masses in check for long, amid the mass impoverishment and loss of all the socialist gains.</p></p>

        <p>But <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CommunismStop/posts/3054926204601266/">here's how</a> the same Bolsheviks fought the typhus epidemic. Sanitary dictatorship! That’s how they called their bloody method… This is article about the typhus epidemic in communist Russia. There are many words there that sound like what we hear now and even more. There’s all about self-sacrifice, universal obligence, forcing etc. Whoever resists the sanitary dictatorship will be executed without trial… If you could understand Russian to read this article, I believe, then you wouldn't such praise that socialist regime and wouldn't scold the so damned capitalists</p>
