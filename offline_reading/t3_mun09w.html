        <p>I’m extremely jaded and mentally exhausted from all of this. The future looks so bleak and dystopian. In some ways I don’t even blame governments for abusing their powers...in 2020 they quickly realised how foolish and gullible we are. People are begging to be enslaved. </p>
<p>As a young person I feel like I have nothing to aspire to anymore. Dreams, career goals, all gone. You either conform to this ‘new world’ or they’ll make your life difficult. </p>
<p>I’m pretty much done arguing with doomers on here. Their insanity makes me sick. I just come on NNN because it is literally the <em>only</em> platform where I can freely voice my thoughts. Before this I never even used Reddit. My friends (all healthy, young and in shape) are doomers and all jabbed up. I’m lucky that my bf and I are on the same page.</p>

        <p>When 9/11 happened I didn't watch the news for weeks, I couldn't stand the constant propaganda. It wasn't until years later that I saw footage of the towers being hit.</p>
<p>My point being, you don't have to allow yourself to get caught up in all this. You can disconnect, move, insulate yourself. Not arguing with doomers would help a lot, might as well try to argue with fascists.</p>
<p>This will all blow over, it always does. They pull this crap every decade or so, do a big wealth transfer, and then by the time it's all over they repeat.</p>
<p>It's a matter of time before the vaccines turn out to be unsafe, and those vaccine passports might not last either. Just another fab, remember when 3D movies were all the rage? And today no one has a 3D TV, what a joke.</p>
<p>And yes NNN is about the only reddit other than r/conspiracy that allows real freedom of speech. People don't get banned here for disagreeing with us either, unlike everywhere else. They like people uninformed from an alternative perspective, even before covid the anti vaxxer reddit was run and brigaded by pro vaxxers, 1984 much?</p>
<p>Glad to hear your partner understands. I've already accepted that I can only seriously date non vaxxed people, I don't want to risk that poison on the health of my future children, I like mine healthy and with limbs thank you very much.</p>

        <p>Been following the news on this since November 2019.  <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/0qnmsz.jpg">I still remember when we broke 100,000 cases worldwide.</a>  I remember when the US had no confirmed cases and things were exploding in China but flights were still happening.</p>
<p>It's amazing how much everyone dropped the ball back then, and now everyone wants to point fingers at people that aren't wearing a mask over a year after the outbreak became public knowledge.</p>
<p>Ya know, if we had done a real lockdown at the right time, we'd never have gotten to the point we're at.  But this one foot in, one foot out nonsense we've pulled for the last 15 months has been more security theater than anything.</p>

        <p>A real lockdown at the right time would have probably been before we even noticed the virus was here, and it would definitely have still been extremely damaging, just as all lockdowns are, especially in the precedent it would set.</p>

        <p>Masks don't help. Before covid they did tests against the flue, and found no clear indication that it made a difference. Covid is way more contagious meaning this is a joke, if masks really worked only n95 and gas masks would be the norm, not a piece of cloth.</p>
<p>Their main argument is that it stops large drops, but then covid doesn't need those to spread.</p>
<p>Edit: oh and I think all this was done on purpose, they failed to prevent it because they didn't want to do so.</p>
<p>They seem to want just one thing, and that's to give us the mrna virus... I mean vaccine. So that's the last thing I'll do.</p>

        <p>I agree that the simple cloth masks are more for show than anything.  That's why I prefer not to wear one.  Not because I think covid is a hoax, not because I think all masks are worthless, etc.</p>
<p>My point is if we locked down international passenger flights and did contact tracing etc. back in December 2019 - February 2020 timeframe last year could have looked MUCH different.</p>
<p>Instead we waited until it was too late to have any hope of containing it, then did some half assed lockdowns that shut down playgrounds while bars stayed open.  </p>
<p>If I had ears on this situation in 2019 I'm sure our government did.</p>

<p>Its not like that everywhere.  There's plenty of towns where no one gives a flying fuck.  I can drive 30 minutes in one direction and everyone is in a mash, or 30 minutes in another and no one is.</p>

        <p>You are the doomer if you think wearing a mask is even close to being enslaved. There's so many more actual dystopian things to be upset about governments for, mask wearing isn't one of them. Hell it'd be laughable if you all weren't so stupid.</p>

        <p>The weird thing to me is seeing marketing graphics with people wearing mask that aren’t Covid-19 related marketing, such as the head of an Apple news feed article having a cartoon graphic of people wearing mask. It’s almost like they’re programming us to never stop wearing them....</p>

        <p>YEh but who cares? If it's so mild in young people that they don't know they have it, and the old people don't die because of the vaccine, who gives a shit about spread?  </p>
<p>We're <strong>never</strong> going to eradicate coronavirus from the earth. That's not how this works. "Zero covid" has never been the goal of any health professional, ever. If you believe in wearing a mask until coronavirus is extinct, you will be wearing a mask for the rest of your life.  </p>
<p>We flattened the curve. The hospitals have room. The elders and obese are vaccinated. We fucking <em>won</em>, but you Doomers love this shit so much because you love wagging your finger and you get to feel like a hero for sitting on the couch.</p>

        <p>Right! The more they pressure people to get the damn "jab", the more I question why they need to put on the pressure to begin with. And the more uncertain they seem about how things will play out after the shot {as made evident by the constant goal post moving} the more I feel that the "no thanks" option is completely reasonable, if not the most logical route. Let them call you a conspiracy theorist - lol.. Remember, they only do that because they are jealous that you actually know how to utilize your gift of critical thinking 😁😏🎁 </p>

        <p>I think you’d enjoy some excerpts from a favourite book of mine, THE ROAD TO SERFDOM by F.A. von Hayek.</p>
<p>“In the first instance, it is probably true that in general the higher the education and intelligence of individuals becomes, the more their views and tastes are differentiated and the less likely they are to agree on a particular hierarchy of values. It is a corollary of this that if we wish to find a high degree of uniform- ity and similarity of outlook, we have to descend to the regions of lower moral and intellectual standards where the more primi- tive and "common" instincts and tastes prevail. This does not mean that the majority of people have low moral standards; it merely means that the largest group of people whose values are very similar are the people with low standards. It is, as it were, the lowest common denominator which unites the largest num- ber of people. If a numerous group is needed, strong enough to impose their views on the values of life on all the rest, it will never be those with highly differentiated and developed tastes- it will be those who form the "mass" in the derogatory sense of the term, the least original and independent, who will be able to put the weight of their numbers behind their particular ideals.
If, however, a potential dictator had to rely entirely on those whose uncomplicated and primitive instincts happen to be very similar, their number would scarcely give sufficient weight to their endeavours. He will have to increase their numbers by converting more to the same simple creed.
Here comes in the second negative principle of selection: he will be able to obtain the support of all the docile and gullible, who have no strong convictions of their own but are prepared to accept a ready-made system of values if it is only drummed into their ears suffiCiently loudly and frequently. It will be those whose vague and imperfectly formed ideas are easily swayed and whose passions and emotions are readily aroused who will thus swell the ranks of the totalitarian party.”</p>
<p>“[T]he desire of the individual to identify himself with a group is very frequently the result of a feeling of inferiority[.]”</p>
<p>“Probably it is true enough that the great majority are rarely capable of thinking independently, that on most questions they accept views which they find ready-made, and that they will be equally content if born or coaxed into one set of beliefs or another. In any society freedom of thought will probably be of direct significance only for a small minority. But this does not mean that anyone is competent, or ought to have power, to select those to whom this freedom is to be reserved.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, it’s an amazing book, for those who are mature enough to understand it (most people aren’t).</p>

        <p>I don’t know if this is true, but I get the sense that some people are finding a purpose in lockdowns. If you already spend your whole life smoking weed and ordering out and just generally not doing shit, all the sudden this is the “responsible” thing to do, and they feel vindicated by that. </p>
<p>People that want lockdowns to continue actually feel like their lives are exciting for once, and even better they don’t have to do anything to feel like a hero. Just makes it easier for them to keep excusing their shitty habits. I’m with you bro, it’s infuriating</p>

        <p>So tired of being labelled a tin-foil hat-wearing crazy conspiracy theorist, all because I'm the only one who won't have a vaccine, who sees through what this all really is. I've lost everyone who I thought were my 'friends'. Funny how I can accept and get over their decisions to get the vaccine and go along with these obsurd rules that the goverment lob at the UK, but they refuse to even listen as to why I'm skeptical and refuse to take a covid test, double mask and stand 6feet apart just to get a coffee with them...</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that. I feel fortunate that I have a friend and a few acquaintances that I can actually talk to in this regard. But it really does get annoying when the topic of discussion everywhere I look is the damned "vaccine".</p>

        <p>A year ago the story was "we can return to normal when the vulnerable groups and people aged 65+ are vaccinated".</p>
<p>Well, they are now. So now what? Oh right, the goalposts were moved and now 75% of the population needs to be vaccinated. Then when that goal is reached, it'll be 90% instead. Then even if we somehow reach 90%, suddenly another COVID variant is mentioned, and the tyrants throw up their hands and say "welp, we can't reopen yet, sorry guys!".</p>
<p>And people like you will be the first in line to defend it.</p>

        <p>It's very liberating. I only wear one if I'm going into a store/business because my state has been issuing fines/citations left and right to business owners for minor violations of these BS regulations. I don't want to be the reason that the health department fucks them over.</p>

        <p>What has been really getting me lately is people who are willing to do a cost/benefit analysis with the vaccines but weren’t willing to do the same thing with COVID and the response to it. Now it’s all “the risk of harm from the vaccine is so minimal compared to the risk of COVID” and “there’s always going to be a chance of negative side effects with vaccines, that’s just a fact of life” when these same people were all “we have to close everything down to get to zero covid.” It’s so infuriating!</p>
<p>Also, why isn’t anyone taking into account those who have had covid and recovered? I had it—it was like a mild cold at best—but I’m still supposed to get the vaccine? Even though for some people the reactions to the vaccine is worse than covid itself? And even though studies indicate that someone with natural antibodies have just as much protection as someone vaccinated? It doesn’t make any sense to me why the millions of naturally immunized people aren’t calculated in the herd immunity numbers. The whole coordinated forced vaccine campaign is just really weird to me.</p>

        <p>The idea is that the vaccine stops transmission, u may not be at risk but you could pass it on to someone who is. Also you can catch covid more than once from 'herd immunity', in some cases the second time in worse. You may save someone's life by getting a little prick in your arm, are you really not going to do that?</p>

        <p>First, that's just not true. But let's say for the sake of argument that it is. That doesn't change the fact that someone who is immune <em>does not</em> transmit the virus, at all. It's like multiplying by zero, it doesn't matter if the virus is a thousand times more infectious and deadly, it just gets neutralized by the immune system. There is no way both to be immune to a virus and still carry it and be infectious to other people.</p>

        <p>Ah, so your saying that 141 million cases and 3 million deaths is as a result of a virus which is neither transmissible or deadly. That's an interesting viewpoint.... Also I think you may be trying to start an arguement with me by agreeing with me, yes being immune does slow transmission of the virus, and what's the best way of being immune? Getting a vaccine.</p>

        <p>The only people who would be NPCs if we lived in some sort of simulation would be the people calling other people NPCs. People that do things, make changes, and affect the whole of society don’t have time to sit around and conspire about the world and power structures, they’re out there working within them to make a difference.</p>
<p>It’s the nincompoops online and on the sidelines throwing shade that have literally nothing better to offer the world, so they sit on their computer and theorize nonsense to make them feel special. That’s you, and you’re not special, you just have bad opinions based on faulty reasoning that you came about through a bias you built online, nothing more and nothing less. You’ll live, eat, pay taxes, shit from time to time like I do and die just like I will. None of your fantasy’s will amount to anything, you’ll outgrow them... then, just as now, your ego will force you to dismiss that you could be stupid enough to believe the nonsense you believe... That or you’ll alienate yourself so much that you’ll die alone and depressed because you’re so far gone. Probably move to like Idaho, Montana, or some shit and never let anyone tell you that the government isn’t listening and watching everything you do. Yeah, sounds about right.</p>

        <p>People are putting vaccinated in their Tinder bios. Yea, so I told this guy that I wasn't going to be getting vaccinated. And he asked why and I said there are bigger risks taking it than not. And he disagrees. I just don't know how I'm supposed to meet people when I'm so controversial for not wanting this. I'm scared. Also, with the whole being affected by people being vaccinated too.</p>

        <p>I just got banned in a local subreddit for saying that vaccinated people don't have to worry about covid and shouldn't have to wear masks, and the local paper this morning has a doctor saying that vaccinated people don't have to worry about covid.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, real life gives me a ton of hope -  over half of the people I see around me do not wear a mask, even in stores.</p>
<p>Don't let reddit give you a false perception of reality. Just quit agreeing to go along with masks in your real life and watch it all disappear. Yeah, you might get harassed by neckbeards and Karens, but that's the price you pay for enjoying your life in the face of other's self-imposed misery.</p>
<p>And I think that's really the reason for the narrative that the vaccinated need to keep wearing a mask. If citizens see too many people enjoying themselves without a mask, they're going to stop caring about rona one way or the other. And if people stop caring and figure out that nobody is dying, they're going to be very upset that their communities sacrificed so much for nothing.</p>

        <p>Ok, well I'm a vegetarian and I'm not obese, research shows that I am a much lower burden on the public health systems than fat meat-eaters. Heart disease kills 10x more people every year than covid has. You all are upping the cost of my insurance/taxes. Would it makes sense for the government to ban meat sales? What about an exercise mandate? Should the government mandate an hour of exercise a day? After all, I am fit and find an hour of exercise to be a very light burden.</p>

        <p>It still is. We haven't achieved herd immunity or eradicated the virus, those are the only 2 ways to end the pandemic. There is no way we will eradicate it because of how contagious and widespread it is so herd immunity. </p>
<p>Young people have died from it and a lot have gotten long lasting effects from it. Some professional footballers have contracted it and had to take extended leave of absence and up their fitness again. You can't play Russian roulette with it. </p>
<p>Again its not just old people that need to get vaccinated it, we need two thirds of the population so we get herd immunity. If just the old people got vaccinated they would be still at some risk as they can still contract it from someone younger as the vaccine isn't 100% effective, its 80%+ effective meaning a 20% you contract it if they come into contact with someone with covid.. But if more and more people get vaccinated we can reduce that number until its negligible.</p>
<p>The main purpose of a vaccine is to protect others from getting the virus not you. That is a common mistake.</p>

        <p>Smallpox? We eradicated smallpox and rinderpest. I heard from this my learning and reading. At the start they may have believed we could have eradicated it but as time went on its become too endemic. </p>
<p>Yes it would have been possible if governments acted quicker to impose lockdowns quicker and more strictly AND people listened. Now coronavirus will become like the flu where it remains endemic and we have seasonal outbreaks of it. </p>

        <p>Listen, a lot of the people brigading the sub are Doomer kids who are terrified of the Coof. They deserve to have a patient kind adult in their life. Be polite, be kind, but be firm. They don't have real life role models of patient, reasoned thinking. They're hyper-emotional screen addicts, and they deserve better than what they've been getting.</p>

        <p>I'm almost through with school. My college is extremely liberal, and even though we have literally ZERO ACTIVE CASES on campus and 6,400 FULLY VACCINATED STUDENTS, we still have to wear masks. I am very frustrated that I still have to wear a mask even though I have lived in the dorms for 4 months now. I never got COVID, even when my dad had it, and all three of my roommates. </p>
<p>I've gotten in trouble a few times for not wearing it at the gym and even though I explain to the staff that the policy makes no sense, I have been told that if I don't follow the rules then I will be banned from the rec center. Some even agree with me but they're so afraid to live life normally again. </p>
<p>Becoming a housewife and moving out to Montana to live on a self-sufficient homestead sounds so freaking good right now.</p>

        <p>If you are hating living through this new normal you aren't going to want any parts of being an MD in the coming years.</p>
<p>My advice is to study naturopathy, find someone to be with and "settle down" as they say.  This world needs more moms not more doctors or lawyers.  You could have a husband, kids, a garden and a home office where you see patients as time allows.  </p>
<p>Too many moms "make time" for family.  That's totally backwards.  They should "make time" for work, not family.  If there's any time left over after nurturing the family and the home use it for work, not the other way around.</p>

        <p>Exactly why I’m considering PA. I was initially wanting to get a DO, but after talking with my PA, she told me all about how she was still able to be a mom. I really want to be in medicine to help people and make them better, and I want to come home to my kids or take days to be only with my kids. She only works 4 days a week, too maternal leave to be with her kids, etc. </p>
<p>If I could afford to study naturopathy then I would, but my college bill is sky high.</p>

It’s okay to be anti lockdown and also recognize that this virus (I think it’s man made) can also do weird shit and kill healthy people. Like I said it’s not likely but it is absolutely giving young healthy people STROKES!!!! My cousin barely survived. He can’t talk anymore! All I’m saying is covid is doing weird shit. It really is! Downvote if you want, I’m on your side..</p>

        <p>That's the worst thing about this sub. They just don't want to acknowledge that this virus can wreck your health, even if you are healthy. 
I feel sorry for your cousin, I had a similar experience with Covid. And not because of that I am a "sheep" that believes mainstream media. I am only sharing my own personal experience.</p>

        <p>There are over 60,000 people subscribed to this sub, which means there are probably ten times that number reading it. "They" do not think as a group. They each individually have wildly diverse opinions on the "virus" ranging from "there is no such thing as viruses it's all terrain" to "it's the most lethal and deadly virus humans have ever faced".  </p>
<p>I believe you about your experience and still I think mainstream media is using psychic driving to create unquestioning compliance with totalitarianism.</p>

        <p>Yes, same here that’s always been the case. Still people aren’t immortal and the virus does kill. Yes the death toll is inflated yes the media overplays it but yes it kills. And there is a hive mentality in this sub, like it or not, where someone will see a post that’s being downvoted and lots of other people reading it will downvote without even considering what the OP was saying. That’s not how we learn or grow or stick together.</p>

        <p>I don't come here to "stick together" in a hive mind, though I do come here to learn and grow. I think so long as disagreements are treated with respect, it's all good. </p>
<p>I've watched downvote/upvote wars on controversial comments, so don't forget, that's a moving count, not a fixed number. And maybe some people downvote if the OP is being an ass or something- we can't know why people downvote. Or they could just be here to vote on their agenda, whatever that is. </p>
<p>This does seem to be a pretty good place to hear many sides of issues instead of just the mainstream corporate media side.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear about your cousin. I believe you that he was diagnosed with "covid" but I don't necessarily trust the diagnoses coming out of the corrupt medical system right now.

        <p>I believe in illness and diseases. But I think that the term Covid is being used as a blanket statement for getting sick and dying. Weird shit has been killing people for all of time. I agree that we need to do something about it but slapping a different name of it doesn’t make it more scary than any other year ever.</p>

        <p>On the bright side, I think the whole world is getting bad so fast, there may not even be a purpose to traveling or going to public events.</p>
<p>In other words, if vaccine passports go into effect, that's kind of the least of our problems. They wouldn't be magical ticket to life pre-2020 in any meaningful way.</p>

        <p>I've reached that point of not even caring about traveling... Unfortunately, the limited travel I'd be interested in would be visiting family--and they have pretty much bought into the official narrative. I have a feeling at least one person might not want to see me unless I had a vaccine. Maybe things will be better in 2022. Or maybe I can make a trip to see a few places I'd like to see again, and convince a few people it would be OK to meet outdoors.</p>

<p>"In short, the PCR swabs are not fit for purpose, they do NOT detect infection by COVID19 and this renders the whole exercise of swab testing as pointless from a detection and clinical identification viewpoint. However, it may make perfect sense if the actual (hidden) purpose of the nasal swab was to insidiously infect and harm the patient with nanotechnological devices for personal tracking, uninformed vaccination and population control"</p>

        <p>This article gets almost everything wrong.  I looked up the article it links as proof that nasal swabs can deposit nanoparticles that cross the blood brain barrier, and the article has nothing to do with that whatsoever.  Not to mention they aren't even swabbing that deeply any longer.  The last few times I got tested last year they just did a quick around the entry of the nose.  Secondly nasal swabs are a natural choice for collecting viral RNA because that is a prime site for viral shedding and rt-pcr is perfectly valid for viral detection.  Thirdly, the virus has been isolated and stocks of it are carried by labs everywhere.  There are reasons to be opposed to the state response to this virus and be skeptical of the of the  vaccine, but this kind of stuff is just poisoning the well.</p>

        <p>Does anyone know of a therapist in California who won’t scrutinize me for my feelings about the “new normal”? My friends are tired of hearing about it and think I’m a nut and I feel so isolated and alone watching everyone around me blindly follow this nonsense. I’ve been through three therapists already who said it’s weird I don’t plan to get the shot... I really need someone to vent to. This is destroying my mental health.</p>

        <p>I know it's a pain getting therapists--I've been there many times--but small comfort here: you may be lucky those therapists didn't last. Judging--which is the feeling I get--is something a therapist generally shouldn't do.</p>
<p>You might just bring this vaccine issue up while "shopping" for a therapist. You might as well filter out the therapists before you commit any time or energy.</p>

        <p>There may be a reason why most people are scrutinizing you, as well as think you are a “nut”. But remember, people can be argumentative and close minded, making it harder to open a dialogue. I suggest researching some medical journals, international or national, reading about the day to day lives of healthcare professionals (whether from a friend or an article), and remembering that confronting conflicting information is okay. There is no big hoax or conspiracy; like you, people have the ability to think and access to information. Growing and learning is a part of being a human. I hope I have helped at least one person today.</p>

        <p>oof, I know it’s hard to get out of the misinformation loop. This is my first time here and I’m just trying to help misguided people and hopefully prevent any harm. But being defensive won’t help you grow. I sincerely suggest reading medical literature! No aggression or sarcasm intended.</p>
<p>I’ve done my research; I do it in my graduate classes building to my career, and even perform research (although in a different subject). In my spare time, I enjoy reading about the progression of human medicine and health. A bit of background info to add some credibility.</p>

        <p>I see what you’re saying. I’m a med-student and do read lot’s of medical literature- I’ve critiqued lot’s of papers too (before COVID). I know you have nothing to believe me on despite my words, but a minority of us health care students do question this pandemic (myself included). The majority don’t- not because they look at the research, but because they listen to the media.</p>

        <p>Ah man, I'm so stressed out right now. I'm leaving for nova Scotia on the 30th and those fuckers just decided that today no ones allowed into the provience, for fucks sake. I'm a military spouse with a dying grandmother and it's looking like this is the last time I will see her. I feel like it's a fear tactic and like the quarantine hotels I can walk right out and the best they can do is give me a fine. But I went and sent an email requesting an exception, like fuck hope I didnt just burn myself. I'm so sick of this bullshit. I'm going to fly in regardless but damn, gonna suck I'll be on a plane for like 9hrs with two children under 3, grant me strength</p>

        <p>When I came to Nova Scotia recently I had to fill out an online check in application on the spot which takes a few mins. Basically it’s just questions of where I plan on quarantining for the next two weeks. After that they will send you an covid check in email every day for the next two weeks, just check in every morning via email (takes 2 seconds). If you don’t check after a few hours then they’ll phone you to check in, if you don’t answer the phone then they send police to check on you.</p>
<p>Now I own a home in the province so I was able to use that as my “quarantine address”, I did the covid check in online every morning but after that...... no ones exactly stopping you from leaving your place of stay if you catch my drift.</p>
<p>In your case I would suggest if you have a place to stay like your own home, a friends place, maybe an Airbnb, as long as it’s not a hotel. Just do the online check ins every morning, go about your day and see you grandmother and don’t tell anyone you just arrived if you can avoid it. Say you’ve been in NS for a month or however long.</p>

        <p>I’m so tired of people going off on others for not wanting the brand new, barely studied, MRNA vaccines. Being accused of being Karen level “vaccines cause autism” anti vaxx for not wanting an experimental gene therapy injected into them. </p>
<p>Like dammit, I’m not antivaxx! I get all my vaccines, as does my child. I get the flu shot. I got the regular pregnancy vaccines to protect my infant after birth. I’m actually pretty damn pro vaxx. </p>
<p>Not wanting an experimental brand new under-researched gene therapy does not equal antivaxx moron. How hard is that to understand?! </p>
<p>I even said, if they created an old fashioned covid vaxx based on well studied technology we’ve been using for years I would probably get it. But they didn’t, for whatever fucking reason. So, sorry not sorry, I’m waiting this one out.</p>

        <p>I know, right?!? I'm in the same boat as you! My wife and I and our two little ones are fully vaccinated, but somehow I'm a crazy for not wanting this one.</p>
<p>Honestly the pressure to get it drives us further into vaccine hesitancy. The more people pressure us, the more we go to places like this to feel relief. We are considering doing the extended vaccine schedule for our third child, or <em>gasp</em> not getting them vaccinated at all.</p>

        <p>If you take off all restrictions (even when the curve has flattened) after about 4-5 months it will start to rise again as it did last year in counties like the US and the UK. It’s just classic exponential growth. 
So yes, right now we are winning but just because we stop fighting, it doesn’t mean that the other side will too.</p>

        <p>The goal has never been to eradicate coronavirus from the Earth. No health professional or government has ever said it was feasible to make coronavirus extinct. That is beyond our capabilities and always has been. From the outset, the expectation was that everyone would get it, and we needed to focus on hospital availability i.E. "flatten then curve" so that everyone didn't get it <em>at the same time</em>. Well, we did that and it worked. Young people don't even get sick from sars-cov-2. Old people who would be hospitalized have gotten the vaccine so they don't get sick either. We won, its over. Not to mention that there are better interventions that promote general health, like vitamin D supplementation. Over 80% of the hospitalized were vit D deficient.</p>
<p>Let me ask you, what criteria do you have for deciding to take your mask off?</p>

        <p>I'm fascinated because the side effects are almost exactly my experience with "long covid". The funniest part of it is that doctors don't know anything about it. 
When I say anything I mean it literally. They just don't know why some people has lingering symptoms after Covid. </p>
<p>And they obviously don't know why some people has side effects from vaccines. Like, it's surreal. What I hate about this is that nobody admits to you "I honestly don't know" and then they proceed to gaslight your symptoms.</p>

        <p>Not a lawyer... But my understanding is that here in the US it's supposedly not legal to mandate a vaccine that's not FDA approved. You  might start researching this.</p>
<p>Of course, schools might find loopholes (particularly, I'd guess, if private). And it's not like plenty of other things got "overridden" by saying "It's an emergency!" And I also wouldn't be surprised if laws get enacted that allow an exception to allow COVID vaccine mandates.</p>

        <p>Anyone else feel like we are going backwards? For a few months I felt like things were going in the right direction, people tired of masks and just wanting it to be over but recently it feels like March 2020 again. I thought by now people would be over it because we have vaccines now but I guess I should never underestimate the ignorance and stupidity of the sheeple. God help us</p>

        <p>Great link! I love this quote under "consensus cracking":</p>
<p>"However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.' " </p>
<p>In other words, if the forum posters counter your(the shill's) bs with facts, then you can flood the forum with irrelevant topics to bury the truth posts.</p>
<p>I've seen so many disinfo posters run for the hills in this forum as they've been confronted with research, data, facts and linked postings. It's a small victory each time. And each thoughtful, reasoned truth post serves to bury their nonsense, also a victory each time.</p>

        <p>I'm getting pressured to get the vaccine. When I say my reasons against it and the survival rate of covid they say 'yeah but even if you survive covid there are long term side effects' (hello there are long term side effects of an experimental vac that we don't even know?!) that doesn't seem to work tho. Plus the risk of even getting covid is slim who knows I may have already had it! Also they say to 'protect them' because even tho they're all vaxxed they could still get it *eye roll* any arguments to counteract these points I feel like I'm losing my mind.</p>

        <p>It is like hunting versus factory farming to me.</p>
<p>I could get the covid by chance and take my chances to survive and perhaps have long term effects (like a deer in the wild).</p>
<p>Or I could intervene with nature and take the vaccine, and absolutely face the possible long term effects of that (like a factory farmed livestock cow).</p>
<p>I’ll choose to let nature run its course without the vaccine. If I am part of the less than 1% who dies of covid, so be it.</p>

        <p>I disagree. The government need only release reliable health information, and recommend actions to take. (They can’t even be trusted to do that, though.)</p>
<p>They are not responsible for legislating how everyone practices good health, in fact, this is far beyond their purview in my opinion.</p>

        <p>Totally agree about your body and your choice.  </p>
<p>But you also have to respect the fact that your choice can (unintentionally) harm others, and your actions, with respect to others (for example, kids not being allowed to go to public schools without vaccination records due to the transmission risk they present), may be restricted because of that.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Exercising personal responsibility and being cognizant of how your actions affect others, something I support tremendously!</p>

<p>Are you implying that becuase your parents have paid for educaiton via taxes, this gives you free reign to go to school without effective protection against known contagious diseases that can cause outbreaks?</p>
<p>regarding being cognizant of risk, and causing harm to others, how much do you know about the eugenics movement of the usa and europe, the depopulation desires of elite billionaires.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but this comes across as a bit conspiratorial. Do you have actual evidence of this being put into policy?</p>

        <p>what protects a child against disease? is a broad question that has more than one answer, but whats your take is it possible that even here where you feel strong we have a lack of a broad cognizance, you must not just give a big pharma lobbyists answer.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>don't you know that eugenics has a history, slavery is a concept we no longer see much overtly, but eugenics and population control is a more recent historical event though like shakespear its not taught in school a google search will help you find it!</p>
<p>consider also though when out of  polite favour, bad societal  practices often linger on  little changed and disguised under different names. they wouldnt have been maniifest if they werent supported by mass psychology, </p>
<p>do you consider it just if i force you to pay for things you dont use?</p>

        <p>We are all forced to pay for services we don’t use. That’s usually in the form of taxes. A voluntary form of this would be insurance.</p>
<p>I don’t deny eugenics has a broad history. Why I’m disputing is that there is a worldwide initiative of billionaires successfully leading eugenics initiatives and that the COVID vaccine has something to do with it.</p>

        <p>are you american, or british, are you pro 1776 or was the tea party a mistake.</p>
<p>further more we should have a consensus surely and i dont think there is a general public movement that is driving legislatures to remove historical parental choice over what medication they think is right for their child, removing philosophical and not  allowing medical or conscientious objection i think is probably an instance where the balance of power between the billion dollar big pharma industry is getting payback for some of the lobbying money and the public interest is getting rebalanced in favour of the drug manufacturers.    </p>
<p>you cannot expect  whenever the moneyed interests are winning out in thier policy control efforts its going to be widely confessed and reported in the news. quite the opposite, billionaire lobbying is quasi conspiratorial by nature and politicians often create names for their bills that mask the contents, politicians and gods honest truth...</p>
<p>you would have to be on the cutting edge of the sector to know what is really happening, investigative commitment of this intensity comes more easily if you have accidentally killed your child via vaccination.</p>
<p>to take away such a persons right not to risk the kill of their next child is ......  </p>

        <p>The way churches have handled all of this has been by far the most depressing thing for me. On the state level, we've been reopened for months. But every single church in my area requires masks, even for outdoor services, and limits attendance and makes you register in advance to be allowed in (both depriving someone else of a spot and giving your personal information to a third party company for them to turn around and sell it).</p>
<p>I haven't been to church in over a year. I watch the services online, but it's not the same. Even if I did go in person, I wouldn't be able to focus on the service due to feeling constantly watched in case my mask went below my nose. Communion isn't being given out normally anymore, it's in prepackaged plastic cups that you take in your seat. It would be one thing if this were all imposed by the government and the church was persisting in spite of the state's restrictions, but the fact is that we could be back to normal, full worship right now and church leadership everywhere is actively choosing not to be.</p>

        <p>I found a small Lutheran church down the street that doesn't care about masks and does communion the old way. Maybe see if there are other options.</p>

        <p>Sorry about that, my brother/sister. I truly am. That sounds like hell on earth.</p>
<p>I really feel for people like you who get cast out of their "tribe," whatever it may be, for not going along with the new abnormal insanity.</p>
<p>I mean, I've always been a pariah of sorts, so having another badge in that direction didn't really bother me. But being cast out of your tribe that you've known for years, if not your entire life? Again, I'm sorry about that.</p>

        <p>Went to mechanic today for a diag. No mask. Sat in waiting room for an hour. No issues. Most employees had no masks. One lady came in with a mask on, and I could tell she was the Karen type just by looking at her. She had to wait for her car, but she exclaimed "I'll be waiting OUTSIDE". And then she proceeded to sit in the rain for 45 minutes with an umbrella. Oh well lady.   </p>
<p>Went to dollar general a few minutes ago. No mask. No issues.</p>

I was schedule to have spinal surgery when a relative said "wait look a the outcomes, most people are back to just as hurting in 5 years and you can't get your vertebrae back".  </p>
<p>So in my desperation I decided to call a chiropractor. I thought they were quacks. Within a week my pain was 80% reduced. Within two weeks I could walk a mile. Over a year later its like I was never injured.  </p>
<p>FUCK modern medicine, MDs, and hospitals.</p>

        <p>I feel like I need permission to be in public spaces now. Putting on a mask, jumping through hoops, not being "symptomatic" is what gives me permission.</p>
<p>It's a subtle change, but an important one.</p>
<p>Before, public spaces were open to everyone by default and access revoked only if you were a complete asshole or violent.</p>

        <p>Had a weird interaction at a skate rink the other night.  Took my teen daughters skating. A random girl a little older came up &amp; struck up a conversation with my daughters. This girl was there with her mother &amp; younger brothers. She &amp; my daughters hang out, skate a little.  At some point, the girl's mother sees her hanging out with my 2, and kinda yells at her in front of my kids about hanging out with strangers and covid and risks. It really makes my one daughter uncomfortable. The girl keeps kind of tailing my kids, ends up back near the table where I was, and is going into full-blown overshare mode (my mom is mean, she loves my siblings more than me, etc. etc.).</p>
<p>At this point, my one daughter is super uncomfortable and just wants to book it out of there. So we let the girl and her mom, who ended up near us at this time, that we're heading out, my daughter's stomach is a little funky, etc.  The mom's eyes widen, looks to me, and says "she's sick? Does she have covid?" Then the mom yells at all 3 of her kids to go to the bathroom to wash hands. They skate off, we're gathering our stuff, and before we can leave, the daughter comes up to me saying they think we have covid, her mom is yelling at her, can I just go and tell the mom we're not sick.</p>
<p>So, I do, and the mom did kind of apologize, saying she's worried &amp; trying to keep her kids safe.  But it was such a weird encounter overall.</p>

        <p>Wow the daughter seems to show more maturity  than the mother who clearly has let the propaganda get to her. </p>
<p>Of all the shit things this pandemic has done to society, it really hurts to see kids not able to have the same childhood we had. I remember my mom would take my brother and I to the playground and encouraged us to play with other kids while the parents watched and socialized. I pray our children don’t grow up feeling so isolated from eachother, it’s crucial for their development to socialize and make friends from a young age.</p>

        <p>this might be stupid but I feel absolutely crazy about this “vaccine shredding” stuff. It sounds very wingnutty! but my period is a week late (no I’m not pregnant) and my periods are always clockwork. The only thing that has changed are my mom and my in-laws have gotten the shots. Also looking at nephews and seeing weird skin rashes and bruising. I’m not trying to spread misinformation at all, but does anyone have info or experience about this potential phenomenon?</p>

        <p>Yes, doctors are all about independent research and unhesitatingly going against the AMA/CDC/Big Pharma if that's where the evidence leads - such is their commitment to Truth above all other concerns. Great advice, especially where vaccines are involved.</p>
<p>/s</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: if she asks, they're just going to give her a canned answer. Remember, according to Official Information™, not one single person has died of a COVID vaccine reaction. NOT ONE. You think they would even CONSIDER the possibility that vaccines could provoke illness in people who didn't receive one directly?</p>

        <p>If you take a step back and look at the big picture, this whole thing seems to be focused on just one goal : get as many people as possible to take the mrna vaccines. That's why they are telling people they'll go back to normal, that they can travel again, that the other ones cause blood cloths...</p>
<p>Every dirty trick in the book to get us to voluntarily take them, with no liability. Those two facts suggests that this stuff is really bad for us, whatever it is.</p>
<p>So the question is why. The first answer would be to make us sick, so they can charge us a lot of money, uninsured of course. They gave us the disease for free, we'll have to pay big for the cure...</p>
<p>The second answer would be sterilization, they want to control our ability to reproduce, it's the one thing you don't need government permission for, so they want to create demand for their fertility drugs. Or they want to take it away completely to reduce our numbers.</p>

        <p>Somebody I know who had the AstraZeneca vaccine tried to insist that I should also get it. I said that I didn't think it was necessary as COVID-19 is of extremely low risk to people in my age group. He actually agreed with this which was a good sign. </p>
<p>He then said that while the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines pose a risk because they are mRNA 'vaccines', the AstraZeneca vaccine is totally safe because it uses a killed SARS-CoV2 virus. </p>
<p>I pointed out that this was incorrect as the AstraZeneca vaccine uses a weakened adenovirus from a chimpanzee. </p>
<p>He immediately called me a conspiracy theorist for believing that and was adamant that it uses a killed SARS-CoV2 virus.</p>
<p>I thought it was common knowledge that the AstraZeneca virus uses a chimpanzee adenovirus vector. I haven't even seen anybody try to claim otherwise before.</p>

<p>No. When people were cautious about mRNA vaccines, vaccine proponents started referring to AZ as "traditional vaccine". But it uses adenovirus, which is a fairly recent vaccine development just like mRNA is.</p>

        <p>While adenoviral vectors (Astra Zeneca and Johnson &amp;Johnson) have been tested in far more people than mRNA vaccines, the technology has been used in only one commercial vaccine prior to covid: a rabies vaccine used to immunize wild animals.</p>

At an age when they should be questioning authority, especially during this 400+ day shitstorm of arbitrary mandates and moving goal posts, they're the age group that is all-in. To paraphrase Thomas Sowell, "it's not that Johnny can't think, Johnny doesn't even know what thinking is."</p>

        <p>Weird to feel a need to vent online about random people you see in your daily life, minding their own business, whom you had no interaction with. Seems like a weird, unhealthy, and "pathetic" fixation (to use OP's descriptor).</p>

        <p>I was starting to feel hopeless, but hten I saw a man not wearing a mask while I was getting my froceries last night. Today, I saw two people (in a different department) walking around the floor without a mask, either. Most of the time, people wear it under their nose or chin, but it was so refreshing to see them just not care. I gave them a huge smile and wave as I walked by.</p>

        <p>I was at a large park yesterday training my dog (she’s doing great BTW- so proud)</p>
<p>and there were signs saying
 “MASK UP” and
 “SIX FEET APART”</p>
<p>I absolutely refuse to wear a mask OUTSIDE where not only can I stay siX fEeT aWaY I could get 200+ away from you if I wanted!</p>
<p>It irritated me so much I was really really tempted to rip the sign off the post and throw it in the garbage and even walked over to it a couple of times to see how secure it was. Turned out I would have definitely needed a knife or something to cut the plastic ties, but I was strongly considering doing it and I am not the type of person who does shit like that.</p>
<p>Not too many people were wearing their masks. And I saw a few lone joggers wearing theirs and they looked like psycho doomers IMO, but I do want to put it out there that-</p>
<p>Masks should be optional! If you feel more comfortable wear a mask outside when no one is around you, that’s your choice. Flip side if that is DONT TELL PEOPLE TO “MASK UP”</p>
<p>I’m not wearing a fucking mask outside in nature.</p>

        <p>so several private Universities, like Duke, have said they will require vaccines. However, the State School system says they will not. I wonder if we are going to see think pieces about the decline in enrollment from minority students because they couldn't get access to vaccines and couldn't attend those universities.</p>

<p>May I suggest instead listening to what he has to say, and doing some research on your own that does NOT involve Reddit, conservative forums, or social media, as they are the sources responsible for spreading this misinformation that has radicalized so many of you?</p>

        <p>hey if you're here to educate us radicalized misinformed morons, then educate us.</p>
<p>tell us how the vaccines work.</p>
<p>what common adverse reactions, if any, have been seen in people who took the vaccines? </p>
<p>how many people experience side effects? </p>
<p>how many covid victims have been under 20? </p>
<p>percentage under 50? under 70? over 80? </p>
<p>what's the chance the average person will survive covid? </p>
<p>how's that compare to previous pandemics? </p>
<p>how long do you need to be exposed to an infected person indoors to likely catch covid? </p>
<p>outdoors? </p>
<p>how likely are you to get covid through shared  surfaces?</p>
<p>i assume you can give pretty good answers to all that off the top of your head, or can find primary sources for most of it quickly.</p>

        <p>Some of sheep I know are finally starting to push that its reasonably safe to start shifting towards a normal lifestyle again.  I'm thinking on getting a shirt that says " Return to normal? I never left it".  </p>
<p>Two things I've come to the conclusion of: Yes, the govt overreached and knows exactly how easy it is to control the people... luckily, now we know exactly what their intent is. </p>
<p>My other thought is this was just a drill. Lockdowns, masks... etc.. They just tested the waters and it was a complete success.</p>

        <p>Well surprise attacks are usually a success, it's the lack of preparation and experience of the defender that makes it effective.</p>
<p>But once the defender learns and adapts, the tactic loses effectiveness. There was relatively little resistance after 9/11, and the OccupyWallStreet movement after 2008 died out quickly enough. Both because it required a lot of initiative and action from citizens to resist it.</p>
<p>But wearing masks and getting vaccinated requires people's action to make it possible, and that's a whole lot harder to achieve. With several states in the US banning vaccine passports, it's already dead in the water. If they change the laws there's little I can do to stop them, but I can refuse to get vaccinated for a very, very long time...</p>
<p>Long enough for the failure of these vaccines to become evident. And believe me, that will happen, you give these companies a blank cheque for an untested technology with zero liability, and they will always abuse that power, it's in their nature. And when they do, it'll be a failure.</p>

        <p>Took my son to the zoo today and there were signs everywhere that said “Wear a mask... or you could become an endangered species too” WTF thank God my son isn’t old enough to read, those had my blood boiling. Who gets off on scaring school age children? These kids are gonna have the worst anxiety ever as adults. </p>
<p>My son is almost 3 and the official rule is 24 months and above need to be masked at all times but once he got past the front gate security theater, we ripped that thing off him so fast. We got a few dirty looks but I could care less at this point. It was nice to see a few other parents weren’t making their kids wear them either.</p>

<p>It's not meant to scare and I can't imagine many children being scared by that. it's a clever zoo-themed reminder to wear your mask. Man, the innocuous things you guys get outraged over!</p>

        <p>I guarantee you you were the only person to get upset about a sign about endangered species at a zoo. By the way, the pandemic is serious, so a little light-hearted "oh haha you could become an  endangered species, get it?!? cause we're a zoo??" is not the worst thing in the world for ANYONE to see.</p>

        <p>If it helps.. Here's a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680614/">Stanford university study</a> ...  "Conclusion:
The existing scientific evidences challenge the safety and efficacy of wearing facemask as preventive intervention for COVID-19. The data suggest that both medical and non-medical facemasks are ineffective to block human-to-human transmission of viral and infectious disease such SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, supporting against the usage of facemasks. Wearing facemasks has been demonstrated to have substantial adverse physiological and psychological effects. These include hypoxia, hypercapnia, shortness of breath, increased acidity and toxicity, activation of fear and stress response, rise in stress hormones, immunosuppression, fatigue, headaches, decline in cognitive performance, predisposition for viral and infectious illnesses, chronic stress, anxiety and depression. Long-term consequences of wearing facemask can cause health deterioration, developing and progression of chronic diseases and premature death. Governments, policy makers and health organizations should utilize prosper and scientific evidence-based approach with respect to wearing facemasks, when the latter is considered as preventive intervention for public health."</p>

        <p>I've seen this "study" (not a study btw, it's an article, as it doesn't produce any new data) linked a couple times now. </p>
<p>An article published in October 2020 is a bit outdated by the standards of our knowledge of this virus, and it's an article of pretty cherry picked data. Some of the data cited is over a decade old. </p>
<p>The single study the author cited that included SARS-Cov-2 was inconclusive by their own admission. The author also referenced the size of the virus being able to pass through a mask;  that is largely regarded as irrelevant now, as the virus is not free floating,  but carried via liquids. </p>
<p>The psychological effects cited are entirely hypothesized, not recorded or observed. </p>
<p>Here is a newer article that concludes masks are helpful and may have beneficial psychological effects. (Personally I find the claim of psychological benefits a little specious, but anyway). </p>
<p>https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118</p>
<p>This is not something that is forever. The human race had survived pandemics before, except now we know more than we ever have. We can prevent some of the death and suffering this virus can cause, until we can get through it. Why not work together?</p>
<p>EDIT: Downvotes, huh. Well, since making this comment, I've learned the "Stanford University study" is in fact, fraudulent. So... there's that. </p>

        <p>I wish I'd saved some links.<br>
the article you list is mostly right, although it seems to have left out some details.<br>
which is fine, though.  </p>
<p>I should've been more concise, the masks didn't infect the people with bacterial pneumonia- it was in fact linked to the flu, yes.<br>
but they wouldn't have developed it without the mask wearing, as it basically allowed for an easy breeding ground for it.  </p>
<p>people have tried masks against viruses in the past. masks like the ones fauci and others suggest do nothing but make you breathe less air.  </p>
<p>but hey, I'm only human. I could be getting something conflated somewhere, and as I don't have the source articles I'm referring to, I understand that you'd think I'm just making up what I'm saying. I'm not, but I could be getting details muddied.  </p>
<p>even if you disregard that [could be wrong, I should really save my sources :\]<br>
it's pretty clear that this entire debacle has in fact been about control and money, and it's not going to end unless the people do something.  </p>
<p>Thanks for at least taking time to see what people have to say. <br>

        <p>Thanks for taking the time to reply! I appreciate you being civil and polite. Not everyone is, haha~</p>
<p>I understand you believe the things you listed, not that you, specifically, are making them up, but there is no evidence I could find to support that mask wearing can cause bacterial pneumonia. Many people who know way more about immunology and virology than you or I have said the same thing. </p>
<p>There are potential risks to wearing masks. Contact dermatitis is one. Mild hypoxia is another, although this can be easily mitigated by removing your mask every few hours. </p>
<p>So far, there is some good evidence to support mask wearing is helpful, and little evidence to support it's harmful in any significant way. Before this pandemic, I wore a mask if I had to be out in public while sick, for the same reasons I wear one now, and never suffered any I'll effects. I personally don't mind it, but I know some people do. It's not forever, though. I think with vaccines, we are beginning to round a corner. </p>
<p>Why is it that you think this is about control and money?  I live in Canada and so far this pandemic has cost rhe government billions in medical care, financial support to citizens, and lost tax revenue. In any disaster, there will be companies that find a way to benefit while the average person suffers, but this is just because capitalism is garbage, not due to some huge multi government plot.</p>

        <p>To me, it's simple enough.<br>
yes, it's costed the governments money- but who has profited from this?<br>
The leading pharmaceutical companies.<br>
And why would the governments be fine with this?<br>
power.  as long as there is "covid-19 pandemic" there is the ability for the governments to slowly restrict people's freedoms, directly giving the governments more power.  </p>
<p>tl;dr <br>
it's more the governments taking advantage of the situation, and the pharma companies are the ones behind it, making tons of money.  </p>
<p>more towards the conspiracy side, could be trying to control the population level?- but <strong>that'</strong>s conspiracy, and there's only collusion to that, so there's not enough hard evidence that that's happening.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, but this just doesn't track for me. </p>
<p>Which pharmaceutical companies?  All of them?  All of them are working together, even though they're competing companies?</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical companies haven't profited as much as you seem to think. Pharmaceutical companies make their billions on brand name drugs that people have to continue using. Vaccines are not where the money is at. 
(See: http://www.boostoregon.org/arent-vaccines-just-moneymakers-for-pharmaceutical-companies )
If they really wanted to abandon any remaining shreds of morality and make the big bucks, they'd spread Hepatitis. </p>
<p>The government wants to restrict people's freedoms ...  to what end? Why would they want that?  When people's freedoms are restricted, they spend less, which is bad for a capitalist society. The government has lost millions in tax revenue already. The government doesn't want people unhappy and restless, which is why many governments (including mine)  have  done these shitty little half measures to keep people from getting upset. Unhappy people don't re-elect you. Really unhappy people overthrow governments. It's in their best interest to keep us feeling happy and secure. Even that is kind of a cynical take, I admit. There are definitely many people in government who genuinely just want things to be better for citizens. They're not usually the ones who have any power, but hey, they're there.</p>

        <p>My wife’s patient today is in his 30s and relatively fit.  He’s on a ventilator.  Must be a wild cold.  It’s not pneumonia from a mask because he refused to wear one.  I know I’m not going to change your mind but I wish you’d just reach out to some of the staff that are struggling to keep people alive in hospital.  If you had a significant other coming home from work looking like a shell of who they were before you’d think about this differently.  Talk to some people with other experiences and not just people that want to agree.  Yes this shit sucks for you. But it sucks a lot more for others. Just have some compassion.</p>

        <p>Yeah your probably right. I didn’t mention her unit is overflowing right now with people in their 50s and 60s.  In Canada we have socialized medicine.  I’m more than happy to make a couple changes to keep our hospitals functioning.  They are so full right now that you really don’t want to be there for anything serious. I think that’s why the rules need to be regional to deal with outbreaks as they happen.</p>

        <p>Unlikely you'll be banned for expressing your concerns. Recently this Sub has been overrun by many of the people you mention above. I'd like to start by saying, Your description mentions native medicine. Personally if that's true ... mad respect. Next I have it on good order from mods here that they prefer evidence/ study backed information / discussions. Unfortunately there's a lot of missinformation on both sides... Mostly MSM driven. As MSM (FB and YT as you mentioned) is highly censored and rarely allows the truth. For alternative sources some of the more experienced users here know to provide source documents (which are also often removed from the internet) so we have backups or save them to other less censored SM platforms like Telegram, Bitchute, etc. Or And for the most part we're pro choice and pro freedom here... Considering your heritage... Well I'll let you come to your own conclusions.</p>

I've found many on here has some measure of understanding of the background of hypocrisy, lies, etc. We've been fed. We're tired of the BS and are seeking change for the better. We're all human and we all share this planet.  Consider rising up with us to fight the oppression and slaughter that is happening. The more vulnerable are at the most risk.  🙏 Keep breathing.</p>

        <p>This sort of response is exactly the issue I'm describing.<br>
you claim I'm sourcing from some sort of conspiracy theorists online<br>
yet I'm telling you I've done the exact opposite.<br>
my claims are based on my observations of this happening, public statements from these so-called professionals [including ones that they later claim the opposite, and hope nobody realises what they said in the past]<br>
one such example is fauci claiming that masks are not necessary, and that masking healthy people is inherently dangerous etc.<br>
then later on, claiming to have 'always supported everyone wearing masks'  </p>
<p>you won't be banned for expressing an opinion.  pretty sure that goes against the whole idea of this sub.  </p>
<p>history repeats itself.<br>
the "experts" you're basing your viewpoint on, have repeatedly lied about a lot of things, flip-flopped on topics and made insane claims.<br>
I don't rely on any "Experts" being spoon-fed to me by the mass media.<br>
yknow, the same media that says "don't be racist", then says "white people are racist".<br>
which is, in of itself, inherently racist.  </p>
<p>these companies are making BILLIONS off of this.<br>
if you really have a doctor for a husband, that really holds no water here.<br>
he doesn't "research" this virus.<br>
he follows protocols that he has been taught.  </p>
<p>you claim I'm spreading misinformation, and propaganda. but what I'm telling you is that you have been GETTING FED misinformation, and propaganda.<br>
Think about this whole ordeal logically.<br>
we go from<br>
NO MASKS to SHUTDOWN EVERYTHING to close random things, open malls, open restaraunts.. to CLOSE some things, partially open restaraunts, outside is fine- but masks again.<br>
it's about control. it's about money.<br>
they control who you can see, when and where.<br>
how many people you can be with.<br>
how much you're ALLOWED TO BREATHE IN PUBLIC.<br>
what businesses can be open.<br>
and soon... who can go.. anywhere at all.<br>
if you don't get a vaccine [which has been rushed and there is no evidence it's actually safe..]<br>
and get a 'vaccine passport'<br>
you'll get refused service. you'll be told not to travel. etc. etc.<br>
and don't get me started on the <br>
"conspiracy" about the micro-chips that detect covid.<br>
because that is now REALLY HAPPENING.  </p>
<p>it's no longer a "conspiracy" when it literally happens in front of you.  </p>
<p>now to be clear. covid 19 is [I believe] a real virus. but, it is not even remotely close to what they say.<br>
the PCR testing resulted in false positives, and they knew it would happen [too high of a CT count]<br>
people dying of other conditions gets marked down as covid.  </p>
<p>the constant fearmongering is insane.  </p>
<p>like I said, I take my information from all over the internet, tons of different people, different sources for such-and-such statistics..<br>
I don't take bias in one side or another. I take ALL the information I can get, and piece things together logically.  </p>
<p>it's hard to sift through all the noise online. the people spreading lies are the loudest.  </p>
<p>this has gotten to be quite a drawn out message, so I'll end it with a lil fun fact.<br>
\&rt;businesses are being extorted to "mandate" masks. if you get a fine for not wearing one in a business, it is the business fining you- which means that they'd have to take it to small claims court. which they won't.[probably.. it would be a waste of time]  </p>
<p>\&rt;the reason the businesses are fining people/refusing service when people refuse to mask up, is because if they don't, the government[or the health officials.. idek at this point] will shut down their business and sue THEM.  </p>
<p>This entire thing has been a violation of people's rights, but the majority of the people are just giving up their rights for free.</p>

        <p>The Fauci argument is ridiculous. He was making a statement based on the facts he had at the time. As more information came in, he realized that he was wrong and started advocating for wearing masks. He is right. You do know it's ok to admit you're wrong when new information and data come in and it's ok to change your mind don't you? It's crazy to think once you've made a decision that no matter what new information or proof comes in proving you were wrong you're still going with your original belief because you refuse to admit you were wrong. That's crazy and ignorant. What data and stories have you observed? What sources do they come from? I'm genuinely curious.</p>

        <p>where exactly did he admit being wrong? he said that 100% masks would be harmful, and then later said he <strong><em>always</em></strong> <em>had</em> supported wearing masks all the time everywhere. 
even if he was right (he's not, this is insanity) he still boldface lied about having said to not wear masks.
he didn't say "I used to be against masks, but now I realise they can be helpful"
he said, in essence. 
"I never said to not wear one"</p>
<p>he is a liar, runs the fact check websites, and makes tons of money off this nonsense happening.</p>
<p>besides, even if you discount what I've said about him (you shouldn't)
the governments are in fact constantly promoting fearmongering and telling people being free is selfish and shouldn't be done.</p>
<p>have we really learned NOTHING from history?</p>
<p>also, as for sources, most of which are literally straight out of the horses mouth.
blatant lies. provably blatant lying.</p>
<p>it shouldn't take a rocket scientist to understand that people are being conditioned, and the governments that have lied for years- are still lying! shocker,I know.</p>

<p>Every day, More threads more people having horrifying side effects that still haven’t ended yet. I will keep pointing this out in the hopes it reaches someone on the fence...this doesn’t seem normal. Don’t take anything you don’t trust. If you want the vaccine make sure it’s because YOU want it and not because of pressure from society or family. Most people don’t know about reporting side effects online so we can only imagine how many are silently suffering to these human trials.</p>

        <p>Went to Walmart and they have a bunch of shirts that come with matching masks. I actually really liked one of the shirts and bought it but I can assure you I would NEVER wear them together. I’m not trying to make this shit cute and fashionable. I have only clocked maybe a few hours total in masks over the last year- only when I want to get food without being harassed honestly. I’m just sick of seeing this shit being normalized everywhere. I can’t even buy a cute shirt without feeling like I’m supporting the narrative.</p>

        <p>Once you’re dead you’re dead jack. Go outside and break the rules you always wanted to break. It’s a lot more liberating than killing yourself. And the way you feel about only being here cuz others want you to be - you’ve been conditioned to think that since birth so that you always seek acceptance or feel obligated to not be free in speech or thought for the sake of friendship.

<p>So in the US, 2020 flu cases were supposedly down to \~5000 while coronavirus cases were \~30 million.</p>
<p>The reasons given are "well, people were social distancing and masking up, which stopped the flu!"</p>
<p>But, like, it didn't stop corona? Do I understand the doublethink correctly? Masks and distancing stop the flu, and they also stop corona, but they don't stop corona as per the 30 million cases?</p>

        <p>The reasons given that you stated are accurate. Covid is more transmissable; methods that reduced flu cases DO reduce covid cases as well--but you still have a lot of Covid.  </p>
<p>"Like SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses are spread primarily by droplet transmission; <strong>the lower transmissibility of seasonal influenza virus (R0 = 1.28) compared with that of SARS-CoV-2 (R0 = 2–3.5) (7) likely contributed to a more substantial interruption in influenza transmission.</strong>"  </p>

        <p>How is transmissibility determined?</p>
<p>The number of cases.</p>
<p>So what this is saying is that "Because corona had more cases, it had more cases". Doesn't really answer why corona is more transmissible than flu under the same conditions e.g. masked and socially distanced.</p>
<p>Unless, you know, masks and social distancing don't stop you from getting corona. Or the corona numbers are vastly inflated.</p>

        <p>Your conclusion seems like a bit of a stretch. Case numbers are not really how transmissibility is determined. Transmission rates, yes. Transmissibility is more complex and involves factors like viral load. For example, we think the new variants are more transmissible as they enter host cells more easily.  </p>
<p>Here's an article about quantifying transmissibility:</p>

        <p>Per your source:</p>
<p>&rt;Mathematical model-based approaches require estimation of the per capita transmission rate and basic reproduction number, obtained by fitting models to case data and/or analysis of pathogen sequence data.</p>
<p>So if you have a faulty PCR test with a high false positive rate, you do have a higher calculated r naught. </p>
<p>I have a hard time believing this is about virions per droplet and cell infiltration. Take hand washing as an intervention - it is equally effective (as in completely effective) for all infectious agents for which it's effective at all. </p>
<p>Yet what we're admitting with these flu and corona numbers is either that </p>
<p>a) masks and social distancing <em>are completely effective interventions for flu</em> but they are virtually ineffective at stopping coronavirus, or</p>
<p>b) the rona numbers are inflated, through a bad test and a bad testing protocol.</p>

<p>I'm not following your conclusions. How does it not seem reasonable to conclude that SARS-Cov-2 is more easily transmissible than influenza? We know for a fact that different viruses are more easily transmissible than others.</p>

        <p>&rt;How does it not seem reasonable to conclude that SARS-Cov-2 is more easily transmissible than influenza?</p>
<p>It does seem reasonable, <em>if there are no interventions</em>. As in, I believe sarsCoV2 is more transmissible than influenza, but interventions that stop one should have stopped the other. To go from 30-50 million flu cases in 2019-2020 to 5000 flu cases points to masks and social distancing being highly effective interventions for aerosolized droplets. Yet we still had 30 million corona cases with the same interventions?</p>
<p>&rt;Except PCR tests have a high rate of false negatives, not positives. (Approx 20% false negatives versus &rt;0.01% false positives).</p>
<p>When the test is ran appropriately. Technicians were running their thermocycler for upwards of <em>40 cycles</em> for all of 2020. At that point it's feasible they were picking up haphazard non sarsCoV2 coronavirus sequence. </p>

        <p>Why would it have stopped both at equal rates?  Neither distancing nor wearing masks are 100% effective at preventing spread. Covid-19 has also had more "superspreader" events. </p>
<p>The fact is, we don't know what a totally uncontrolled spread of Covid-19 would look like, but I would guess it would completely overwhelm any country's health care system. </p>

<p>No, he is talking about the fundamental issue with pcr-test, which is: they can find basically anything everywhere if you missuse them.</p>
<p>If you take 10.000 probes of anything and run them for 30 cycles your results will average a lot less positive results vs running them for 40 cycles.</p>
<p>Thats a fundamental property of pcr-tests and why there is heavy critique against the mass-use and basing laws on pcr-numbers (as just now happend in germany).</p>

        <p>Oh I agree PCR tests are not very accurate, I just can't find any data to show that they result in a number of false positives that would significantly exceed the percentage of false negatives. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm just not understanding(very possible), but running the PCR test for more cycles that necessary would just further amplify the original genetic material, which could result in a false positive for something that doesn't have an active infection, but may have been infected in the past, wouldn't it?  While you can detect a positive after 30 cycles, 38 seems to be the cutoff. In my country, any PCR test run for more than 38 cycles is considered an inconclusive result. </p>
<p>Here's one of the articles I read that suggests a possible false positive rate of up to 22.6%, but the author admits that is with a pretty heavy confirmation bias. </p>

<p>No, not cross contamination. PCR is generally very selective, but when you melt the DNA and cool it to allowed for the polymerase, you have a chance of error, or a chance of replicating non-target but similar sequences. The chance of error goes up exponentially with each cycle. Here is an accessible version of the article. https://archive.ph/VIFhL</p>

<p>The idea is  infectivity is higher with corona. I havent seen it defined anywhere, but basically things like:</p>
<p>If you breath out with influenza you spread 10.000 viruses, if you breath out with Covid you spread 100.000 viruses.</p>
<p>If 1 influenza virus hits you, your chance of infection is 1/1.000.</p>
<p>If 1 corona virus hits you, your chance of infection is 1/100.</p>
<p>As such, assuming a mask reduce risk of infection by 90%, corona would still be 10x as infectious (assuming my magic numbers).</p>

        <p>So the most conservative estimate of flu cases for 2019-2020 flu season is 31,000,000. Reducing that to 5000 means masks, social distancing, and lockdowns reduced influenza by 99.98%</p>
<p>There were supposedly 30 million coronavirus cases in the same timeframe as the 5000 flu cases. Since we don't have past data for coronavirus, let's use our most generous estimate, and say that without lockdowns, every one of the 330 million people in the US would have been infected. The <em>most</em> effective masks and distancing could have been was roughly 90% reduction in coronavirus transmission (likely much less effective, but we're going with the most forgiving estimate)</p>
<p>So, same method of transmission, same interventions, and influenza gets reduced by 99.98%, and coronavirus gets reduced by AT MOST 90%.</p>
<p>So.... Is coronavirus 500x more transmissible than influenza? That doesn't agree with the official estimates of influenza having an r naught close to 1 and coronavirus being 2-4 times more transmissible with an r naught of 2-4.</p>
<p>The CDC numbers aren't even internally consistent.</p>

        <p>Exactly, if Masks had the same effect on Corona, it would imply that 30,000,000 / 0.00016 = 193,750,000,000 - 31,000,000 = 193,719,000,000 Infections have been prevented by Masks.</p>
<p>Another way of putting it would be: If only 30 Million got infected in 12 Months and it should have been 193 Billion, it implies that without masks the US should have had 300 Million Infected within \~14 hours.</p>
<p>That of course assumes that Masks &amp; physical distancing have the same preventive effects on Influenza as Corona. But beware, if those numbers would be considered, it would only cause people to assume Corona was just thaaaat more dangerous than Influenza...</p>

        <p>Well, I think it's also that the flu virus spreads differently than Covid-19. Covid-19 is thought to spread primarily via aerosol, while transmission via aerosol is uncommon for influenza. So yes, in a significant way, Covid-19 does spread more easily. </p>
<p>Physical distancing is also much more effective for influenza than Covid-19. We would probably need the majority wearing properly fitted N95 masks to see a decline in cases comparable to the flu.</p>

<p>I just wish the were actual numbers being presented, so we can see if the theory actually holds up to reality. So far I have no where seen anyone put actual numbers up, which makes it all a guessing game. Thats not enough for me in times where Im supposed to trust the science and see my family business destroyed, havent played a proper game of sports for a year, had my first year without swimming, didnt get to see my friends properly...</p>

        <p>It would be nice to have actual numbers, but if that "reality" ends up killing a lot of people, it wouldn't be worth it. We can only work with the information we have. </p>
<p>I'm sorry you've suffered from restrictions. I think we all have, to different degrees. I can appreciate your frustration and I agree that the way most governments have handled restrictions is just stupid. I live in BC and honestly I'm frustrated by all these stupid half measures. Businesses are suffering and some rules are totally nonsensical.</p>
<p>I think we needed an actual lockdown in the beginning and better procurement and distribution of vaccines. But the damage is done now, so what to do? Unfortunately my country's government doesn't seem to know how to be aggressive with anything.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the accessible link!  So this article is saying the PCR test is giving false positives in that people infected with a lower viral load are testing positive. But... they're still infected, aren't they?  I can understand why that would be a problem in terms of contact tracing, but not necessarily a general count of infected people. </p>
<p>The article doesn't seem to mention anything about false positives resulting from detecting a similar non SARS-Cov-2 sequence. Is that in a different article?</p>

        <p>&rt;So this article is saying the PCR test is giving false positives in that people infected with a lower viral load are testing positive. But... they're still infected, aren't they?</p>
<p>Sometimes, but sometimes not. What is detected could be remnants from an old Sars-cov-2 infection. Even when it is an 'active' sars-cov-2, with that high cycle threshold they were detecting what is called a 'sub-clinical infection'. You do not get sick, it is <em>barely</em> detectable, and it is not transmissible at all. Hence the idea that the test was too sensitive.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I can understand why that would be a problem in terms of contact tracing, but not necessarily a general count of infected people.</p>
<p>But do we want a general count of everyone carrying sars-cov-2 if they aren't sick and aren't carrying enough to transmit it to others? This is the very idea I have behind inflated case and death counts attributed to covid. If the virus goes un-noticed by a vast majority of the infected, it doesn't really represent a public health concern. This is why I am <em>for</em> getting our elders vaccinated (which is pretty much completed) then dropping the mask mandates. Kids don't go to the hospital for Covid, and neither do vaccinated adults.</p>
<p>For context, you constantly have 'infections' from various viruses in you. Some of them have permanently integrated into your genome, are constantly infecting you, and represent a significant constant immunological and caloric burden in your body (see Epstein-Barr Virus and Mononucleosis). Nothing can really be done about this. You could (and likely do) have a dozen different viruses in you at various sub-clinical stages, but no health authority cares because they don't really do anything. In fact, I recall reading preliminary research in my undergrad days (\~2011) that regular immune system modulation <em>requires</em> these kinds of constant immunological burdens.</p>
<p>&rt;The article doesn't seem to mention anything about false positives resulting from detecting a similar non SARS-Cov-2 sequence. Is that in a different article?</p>
<p>No, that is from my 3 years of experience as an undergraduate research assistant at Iowa State University, working with a PCR thermocycler every day :D We would frequently use PCR to ensure that our gene-of-interest had been inserted, and the cycle threshold was always something that was considered for this very reason. In fact, one of the graduate students almost has some research rejected at peer review for using high cycle thresholds for confirmation.</p>
<p>As an aside, I very much appreciate your earnest and polite tone and your curiosity about molecular biology! I bet you're a dynamite student and would make a great biochemist or molecular biologist, if you're not one already.</p>

        <p>I see, thank you for your response!  I appreciate your taking the time to explain your thoughts.</p>
<p>I'm not a student, just some curious dumbass. (Closest thing is working with veterinary medicine in a shelter environment, which is why I feel weird referring to Covid-19 as "coronavirus" because I mentally associate coronavirus with cats due to FCoV.)</p>
<p>It sounds like recording viral loads would be more useful than a simple positive or negative, which I can definitely agree with, but I do think it's a little early to do away with precautions, especially with the prevalence of the new variants that seem to be more deadly to younger people. </p>
<p>&rt;You constantly have 'infections' from various viruses in you. Some of them have permanently integrated into your genome, are constantly infecting you, and represent a significant constant immunological and caloric burden in your body(...)</p>
<p>Oh yes!  Viruses are constantly altering us. It's kind of scary to think about at times, but also kind of neat. It's my understanding that a good immune system is an experienced immune system, which is why vaccines work. </p>
<p>I honestly thing this new virus will be with us for quite some time, considering how contagious it is and its zoonotic qualities, and may just become a yearly vaccine like the flu. But with so few people vaccinated and severe complications being such a burden on the health care system, I don't think we're there yet.</p>

        <p>There can't be causation if scientists refuse to even consider the possibility. It's a common social phenomena in academic circles: when a theory is unpopular, scientists won't touch it because it goes against their bias, or for fear of losing reputation (and funding).</p>

        <p>my covid related anxiety has gone through the roof since I experienced a bad sore throat. it triggered a panic attack. </p>
<p>I feel afraid to get sick. I'm also feeling like body is repressing illness because of subconscious covid fear. I'm not logically afraid but of course the subconscious picks up all the doom programming. </p>
<p>it doesn't help that I almost died from pneumonia last year. </p>
<p>I've changed my lifestyle but being a single parent also brings new concerns. </p>
<p>I hate this. I've never been afraid of being sick.</p>

<p>So 20 per 100,000 is .02% of people who get covid end up in hospital.  If you under 65, it will be .015%.</p>

<p>I see a lot of us are saying “I don’t care what you do/If you want to live in fear forever that’s your choice!” I disagree and this is a loser’s mentality. They publicly shame us for NOT wearing masks! After the pandemic (If that’s a thing) we need to call out people for wearing masks post covid for no reason. There needs to be social consequences for their crazy behavior if you ACTUALLY want to fight against “The New Normal” and get our pre-2020 “Normal” back.</p>

        <p>Goes for both sides, 90% of anti vaxxers I had the experiece dealing with are bat shit crazy and say the same about wearing a mask in the first place.
Secondly, why would you want to call out people for wearing a mask whatever the time is? What kind of logic is that?</p>

        <p>Covid vaccine might be like crypto in reverse. Basically a biological computervirus that destroys your bio-hardware, and you only get one of those (for now).</p>
<p>With crypto, in the beginning no one took notice, and then after a decade it turned out to be the investment of a life time. With vaccines, everyone wants it and it's the deal of a lifetime! But in a decade it might turn out to kill anyone who took it.</p>
<p>If you refuse to take the vaccine, you might end up killing yourself... or not killing yourself.</p>
<p>Generally the masses are wrong on just about everything, especially the big stuff. So if everyone say yes to the vaccine/no to crypto, it seems like the smart bet is to say no to the vaccine/yes to crypto.</p>
<p>You might be the equivalent of a future anti-vaccine billionaire! I mean who wouldn't care to pay a billion Dollars to be in good health?</p>

Well one, you're all under house arrest so 🤷‍♀️ and you kids are scared because you've been telling them constantly how deadly it is.
Her symptoms, sounded exactly like the flu I had 9 years ago minus all the throwing up I did 🤷‍♀️ or the 2 pregnancies I've had</p>

        <p>I was so pleased to find out that they were recalling the J&amp;J vaccine. It showed such forethought for the first time from the US authorities. Now, it's not even a fortnight and they are recalling their recall. This is not the nice J&amp;J company that I grew up with, that sold the petroleum jelly my mom used on my bottom after every diaper change. This is a monster company that must be stopped.</p>

        <p>Back again, feeling more and more like I'm living in some sort of alternative timeline. I didn't want to believe the theories, that vaccine passports would genuinely become a reality, but here we are.   </p>
<p>I'm scared, I'll be honest, I'm fearful for myself, I don't want to take part in this, but I'm afraid I might have to. No mainstream politician even cares, they don't have my interest at heart. If I had it my way, I'd buy land, and build a self-sufficient log cabin, fuck this modernity.   </p>
<p>Feels like we're looking at some hard times ahead, I just hope something stops before all of this. I hate feeling like I'm being crucified on both ends, I'm either a doomer, or a conspiracy theorist, the reality is there, but I feel like I can't be either, I'm not naïve, but I don't want to hate existence either.</p>

        <p>I do, however the creeping sense that things are changing for the worse is still there. You can't tell me that you're genuinely okay with the way things are moving. Are you going to be okay with someone requiring your medical information to enter somewhere as small as a local pub? Or the fact that the government has no qualms with flushing your human rights down the pan? Look, man, I don't really care if I don't change your opinion, in fact I'm fairly certain I won't, but what I will tell you is that when things become unrecognizable to how they were before to you one day, and you get barred from a job because you've not had your vaccine booster 3 years from now, I'll be here.   </p>
<p>I'm sure you've got more people to make fun of for their opinions though, so I'll let you move along.</p>

        <p>Straight up. I am not concerned. I am very optimistic that we are doing pretty good as a country facing this thing, especially seeing how India is doing right now. 
I have no problem with people knowing I am fully vaccinated. It better contains the virus knowing people who go in are at least protected. 
I personally don’t see it as an invasion of my personal rights. </p>
<p>Where was I making fun of anyone’s opinions? I just tried to give you my real solid advice to not overthink it and just keep living your life. </p>
<p>And I won’t have that issue man. I am fully vaccinated, haven’t felt this good and relieved since this all began. I will take whatever boosters there are offered.</p>

        <p>Then clearly my counterargument is wasted, you've already set your outlook in stone, and that's fine. I'll respect your opinion if you at least respect mine, your entire post history recently is just you trash talking people on here or people of a political outlook different to yours, it's all public, dude.   </p>
<p>I'm glad that things work for you, but sadly for a large majority of people who look at things differently, they can't say the same. Personally, while I am partially vaccinated, I will not receive a booster shot, I know that my chances with this virus are fine, I'm young and not at any risk. Coercing people to get a vaccination regardless of risk because you restrict their life's activities based on an arbitrary passport system that does nothing but create division is a bad idea even just on paper, in practice is will be hideous.   </p>
<p>I get it though, you're probably someone who made an alternative account to go ahead and enact what you see as justice against the people the news has told you are bad, that's okay, we all have things we believe in, and I'm glad that you have something you cling onto that deeply that you'd actively go into a community you dislike to trash talk them.</p>

        <p>Lol I meant specifically with your post. I didn’t say anything rude to you. And nah I’m too busy to have an alt account lol. I dont have any social media and this random account on Reddit is my only “social media”. Yes I get annoyed with people from time to time and vent my frustrations but obviously I feel free to because I make a point to not link my private life to anything online. </p>
<p>Honestly I don’t even remember or care to look at any past posts I have made, obviously I don’t take Reddit seriously. </p>
<p>I’m glad you got partially vaccinated! Glad to hear you will be unlikely to die. I advocate for the vaccine and get frustrated with people because I believe this is real and serious. Also what’s the point of talking in a public forum if all you really want is an echo chamber.</p>

        <p>I wanted to slap my MIL today. 5 year old niece asks me if I like her mask, I say no. She shows me how she carrys it around her wrist and asks if I do that, I say I don’t really wear masks so no. She’s like “you HAVE TO when you see people who you don’t know the names of because of the virus!!” (Breaks my heart) then her 7 y/o brother is getting ready to leave and puts his mask on and MIL says, “sweetie, we aren’t seeing anyone out of our pod so we do not have to wear masks yet” ughhhh I am so glad I don’t have kids because we would not fit in. I would not normalize this for them. I would tell them the truth.</p>
<p>Edit: this post got trolled and is giving negativity to the sub. I do not condone violence. I never slapped or truly wanted to slap anyone, I’m just frustrated how nobody is even questioning restrictions. I wasn’t mean to a 5 year old I just told her I don’t wear masks.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't fit in, either.</p>
<p>I'm glad I'm not a parent. I have a very pessimistic view of the future. As the end of the line, I don't have to worry about having kids who'd inherit this messed up world.</p>
<p>And as for the younger kids out there...I keep honestly wondering what the impact of this era will be. We are now at a year-plus of this nightmare, and that's a long time in the life of a kid.</p>

        <p>How is anything that was said to the 5 year old, considered picking a fight? They were honest answers to the kid's question. Answers she'll probably forget after watching cartoons for a few hours. </p>
<p>Picking a fight would be going up to the kid for no reason and saying, "hey, your mask sucks!!"</p>

        <p>As someone not on your side reading the comments I saw someone say they got banned from the /r Coronavirus for trying to talk, I too would just like to talk, is a major reason you're not getting the covid vaccine because you were anti Vax before covid or is it just a distrust of the vaccine and the length of time it was worked on? I'm not trying to change anyone's minds I'm just curious as to what some of the reasons for not getting it are.</p>

        <p>I have family that have worked for asteazeneca in macclesfield. Those  3 people in my family won't take it because they don't trust the companies making the vaccines. </p>
<p>I am not anti vax generally. I've always taken my flu vaccine etc. However, I do not want to take this covid vaccine. It is being used for emergency use only. The trials are still going on till 2023. It is not really a vaccine. It's more gene therapy. And I'm well aware of how many studies get buried to push a narrative because it does make these companies money at the end of the day. </p>
<p>My protest is that why should we be forced to take a vaccine that isnt even a year old? We don't know the full extent of long term side effects. What happens 5-6 years down the line? The chemicals in the vaccines are non toxic in low doses but if we keep having to have the vaccine repeatedly (which is what they are pushing) then the exposure does increase. I just don't trust the government to have our best interest at heart. </p>
<p>Furthermore l I am against vaccine passports because it encourages a two tier society. There are people who can't take it for religious reasons and then that's discrimination and haven't we learned anything about why that is bad? Isn't that why there's been BLM protests constantly this year?</p>
<p>If you are over the age of 50. I think you should take it. You are at a higher risk of death than someone who is in their 20s like myself. But why do the rest of us need it when most of us are gonna be fine?</p>
<p>Also the data that keeps coming out is flip flopping all over the place. As someone who is degree educated to a masters level in a STEM subject this raises alarm bells as to the kind of research being carried out. The UK government just said 25% of all covid deaths aren't related to covid putting the death rate even lower. It's just plain bad science. Half truths. Picking and choosing what fits. The statistics coming out of the UK government make no sense and their scientific methods also don't make sense either. So no I won't be taking it. Not until 2023 at the earliest. </p>
<p>I think if you want to take it you should but don't wish to be forced into it and I think vaccine passports are a terrible idea.</p>

<p>What does degree educated to a master’s level mean? You have a master’s degree? Because you talk like someone who doesn’t, but wants people to think you do.</p>
<p>Go check out the situation in India, and when this shit mutates heavily and unvaccinated people like you allow it to do even more damage in the US. You’ll realize why people pushed so hard to produce and make available these vaccines. But you’re too selfish to do anything other than feel sorry for yourself.</p>

        <p>I have pretty much every vaccine and I usually get the flu vaccine, so safe to say I’m not anti vax. I just can’t and won’t trust a vaccine that has been rushed through. As safe as they say it is, it’s still true that the vaccine only has emergency use authorization. </p>
<p>I have no contact with people above 60, and as a healthy 21 yo I have absolutely nothing to gain from vaccinating myself against COVID. </p>
<p>The way I see it I can either risk getting a disease that I know I have an extremely high chance of barely suffering, or I can get a vaccine that hasn’t been fully researched and could give me problems a few years down the road.</p>

        <p>It’s not quite distrust. For me, the fact that the vaccines have emergency use authorization rather than actual approval shows that these vaccines are not like the other, approved ones. Maybe I will get the vaccine, but that’ll be in at least 5-10 years when the research is complete.</p>

        <p>&rt; The case for keeping outdoor mask mandates starts with the fact that masks are highly effective in general. They block viral spittle and may also warm the nose and mouth to create a humid microclimate that interferes with the virus’s ability to dock with our cells.</p>

<p>Because I didn't do that. Did you just get far enough to justify your beliefs and stop reading? Here, finish it up.</p>
<p>"Outdoor mask mandates might also turn people off from obeying better rules. “Given the very low risk of transmission outdoors, I think outdoor mask use, from a public-health perspective, seems arbitrary,” Muge Cevik, an infectious-disease and virology expert at the University of St. Andrews, in Scotland, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/04/13/covid-outside-safety/">told</a> <em>The Washington Post</em>. “I think it affects the public’s trust and willingness to engage in much higher-yield interventions. We want people to be much more vigilant in indoor spaces.”</p>
<p>Julia Marcus, an epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/dudes-who-wont-wear-masks/613375/">spoke</a> with several male mask skeptics last year for a piece in <em>The Atlantic</em>. When she explained that masking wasn’t as important outdoors, the men became more amenable to wearing them indoors. By connecting rules to reasons, she got them to see the value of covering their nose and mouth when it actually mattered. Last week, Marcus told me that she’s baffled by the notion that the best way to get people to wear masks inside is to mandate that everybody wear one when they’re alone outside. “We don’t recommend condom use when people are enjoying themselves alone to get them to wear condoms with their sexual partners,” she said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/why-arent-we-wearing-better-masks/617656/"><em>Read: Why aren’t we wearing better masks?</em></a></p>
<p>The argument that outdoor mask mandates create a warm and fuzzy feeling of social solidarity confuses a <em>personal</em> definition of etiquette (“<em>I</em> think my mask makes everybody feel safe”) with a <em>public</em> defense of population-wide laws (“<em>everybody</em> should wear a mask everywhere, because it’s the only way to make everybody feel safe<strong>”</strong>). Masks send all sorts of messages to all sorts of different people. To some, they’re beacons of safety; to others, they’re signs of imperious government overreach. As Marcus argued, mandating a public-health tool that’s not needed can drive away people who might otherwise be on board with more important interventions. “I think there’s a proportion of the population that believes restrictions will last indefinitely,” Marcus said, “and they are probably one of the hardest groups to keep engaged in public-health efforts.”</p>
<p>Finally, mandating outdoor masks and closing public areas makes a show of "taking the virus seriously" while doing nothing to reduce indoor spread, in a way that often hurts the less fortunate. To deal with its COVID-19 spike, for example, the Canadian province of Ontario <a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/ophs-parks-order-put-on-hold-as-officials-wait-for-details-on-amenities-closed-by-province">instituted</a> a stay-at-home order and closed many parks and playgrounds. “These policies are made by people who have yards,” Marcus said. “If you live in an apartment building and have no yard, and are required to wear masks at all times outdoors, you never get to be maskless outside. And then, where do people gather maskless to socialize? Inside their homes”—where the risk of transmission is higher."</p>

        <p>Yes, masks work but mostly indoors, and the need to wear them outdoors will be lessened as more people get the vaccine.</p>
<p>No one is whining about wearing a mask outdoors, they’re whining about wearing them while shopping. Why? Because you don’t get to be a martyr if there’s not a manager to scream at.</p>

<p>Why do you keep tying things to vaccination that don't make sense? <strong>This is exactly what the article says causes mask and vaccine hesitancy.</strong></p>
<p>Per the article, the chances of getting sars-cov-2 outdoors are so close to zero that they're negligible. We know <em>now</em> that you <em>have never</em> needed to wear a mask outdoors.</p>
<p>Also, do you remember, a year ago, when the goal was to flatten the curve? Everything has become about the vaccine, but a year ago we recognized that almost everyone would get covid, and it was inconsequential for most people, but we needed to keep the hospitals from overflowing.</p>
<p>We did that. We won. We flattened the curve. Almost everybody is naturally immune. The old people are vaccinated.</p>

        <p>&rt; Rising vaccinations and burbling variants make for an awkward transition period in which it’s legitimately confusing to know when masking is a necessary and considerate act, and when it’s no more epidemiologically protective than, say, wearing a hat.</p>
<p>The writer assumes that the reader is not a nutjob who refuses to get a vaccine, so you’ll have to forgive him for not clearly spelling out for you in red crayon that a prerequisite to his thinking is the number of vaccinations increasing.</p>
<p>If this number increases enough to severely lessen lockdown restrictions, then be sure to thank the patriots who cared enough about their country to stand up and protect themselves and their communities while you hunched over your iPad frantically arguing with people on your special safe space subreddit.</p>

        <p>Yes, this particular strain. I don’t think you realize how quickly this thing has already mutated. I imagine squirrels running on power lines are equally unphazed.</p>
<p>I imagine you’d call china third world as well, and yet they did effect you severely over the last year. The best chance we have of not doing this with a more virulent strain is getting as much of the population vaccinated as possible but... oh no, the Alberta bumpkin couldn’t understand the gravity of the situation! It seems the school system he adamantly refuses to pay more taxes to has failed him. Poor boy 😢</p>

        <p>What gravity of the situation am I missing? I’m so safe from Covid that my government hasn’t even offered me a vaccine yet. If the situation changes and Covid does become a threat to me then the risk and reward of taking the vaccine will change and my opinion will change. </p>

        <p>No. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of how vaccines work. The vaccines are not personal immunity shots. They exist to heavily suppress a populations ability to host the virus, denying oxygen to the flame. There will always be outliers but if enough get it, we can eradicate things like smallpox. However, some things mutate too quickly, like the flu. Yearly flu shots help to suppress the population enough to keep it under control, but we may never get rid of it.</p>
<p>You’re a special, individual little snowflake who keeps saying “I’m not breaking this branch!!” while all your other special, individual little snowflakes pile on before finally, the branch snaps and all of you fucking morons are going to go screaming to the ground with “HOW COULD BIDEN LET THIS HAPPEN????”</p>

        <p>I don’t believe that the vaccines are dangerous, but I don’t think that young people should be rushing to get them when they are not at risk of Covid and the vaccines are not approved and the producers are not liable. People 60+ should absolutely get a vaccine tho. </p>
<p>As for masks I don’t know if they work or not, but I wear my mask whenever I’m supposed to.</p>
<p>What I mean about your grandma is I don’t believe that old people dying to Covid should not be prioritized over young people dying from suicide, opioids, and other issues. Even if my grandma and your grandma have to die, I don’t care.</p>

<p>I think lockdowns were necessary but it would be great for the reasons you mentioned (mental health, social wellbeing, economy, etc) to get back to normal as soon as possible. This will require vaccinations and maskwearing. Refusal to do these things will slow down reopening, and increase fatalities along the way.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. Although with how non-lethal the virus is to young people, I think that once we have most people 50+ vaccinated we should be ok. Which is why I don’t have a problem not getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>I’m not sure about lockdowns, imo politicians have opted for lockdowns over opening and facing the consequences for political reasons rather than scientific reasons. Maybe the science completely supports lockdowns too, but I don’t think that they have considered it as much as they claim.</p>

        <p>I think, while I supported lockdowns, you're right that we're near the end and will be able to be just about at the end, hopefully, with most older folks vaccinated. I also think lockdowns have much more room for reasonable debate and discussion and disagreement than masks or vaccines. While I feel the latter are pretty cut-and-dry, lockdowns are incredibly complex with their effects on economies and wellbeing so it is much harder to say, and fair to disagree on.</p>

        <p>I am not anti-vax in general. I used to be in the "I don't want to be the first one taking it, but I'll probably take it later". But seeing the survival rates and the whole misinformation campaign around the virus, the erosion of personal freedoms, I don't want to play the game. I don't care if other people take it, just don't force me to get it.</p>

        <p>I already had Covid and then long covid. The trials didn't include people that had lingering symptoms as myself. 
Now we have anecdotal reports from folks in my situation that decided to try it, but well, I just don't want to take a vax that was not tested on my demographic to protect me from a virus that I already had. Doesn't make sense.</p>

        <p>Appreciate a candid talk. Well, we have had numerous epidemiologists/scientists/biologists come out against everything really. Response in the form of smear campaigns, censorship and thus no candid discussion. Red flag. Then a media response (where we have absolutely lost faith in) from some  bureaucrats with horrible pasts and fingers in the pie. Red flag and illegal. I never used to be antivax but am now exvax as 2020 gave me a lot of time to pay attention to the situation from a micro and macro outlook, research, I figured out why my son was on the autism spectrum and even found a detox cure which worked! But now if a fda approved vaccine/inoculation can do this much and more, how far could a untested gene therapy go? The cat's been out the bag for ages so we've been sitting here wondering to ourselves how so many people cannot see it, theories have been factual and outcomes affirmative. We all need to discuss without the divide. ADE already starting in india and other ethnic countries. Ironically us ex/antivaxxers may now agree to isolating and masks as of the ADE but time is running out faster as they escalate the roll-out.</p>

        <p>Same reason I don't get a flu shot every year: it's not a threat, I generally have good hygiene and only get the flu once every few years, and when I do it's a few days of fever and aches and then it's done. I don't go out when I'm sick, both out of a desire not to get other people sick and because it's just unpleasant to be moving around with aches and chills.</p>
<p>So if I get COVID-19, that's a risk I've accepted. I'll stay in while I'm sick, be sick for a few days, and then be through with it. It's highly probable though that I'll never get it, or if it becomes seasonal I'll only get it once every few years. If it's really possible to be infected and be asymptomatic, there's a good chance I've already had it. I've been to multiple indoor events with 100+ people without masks over the past year and to my knowledge nobody was infected from any of them, so both from personal experience and from population-wide data I don't believe this is something that's necessary to vaccinate against.</p>

        <p>I have a background in bureaucracy, which has trained me to "read between the lines".</p>
<p>Which is why I'm disturbed when I read government reports that the vaccine isn't responsible for heart attacks. Because when you read what they're actually saying, it's always the same:</p>
<p>- heart attack is not a known side effect from the vaccine.</p>
<p>- they found no indication of allergy.</p>
<p>- thus the vaccine didn't cause the person to die.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is disturbing, because what they're really saying is that because they don't <strong>believe</strong> for the vaccine to cause heart attacks, it is excluded as a possibility. And because it is excluded, and there's no allergic reaction, then the only explanation is that it must have been a natural heart attack.</p>
<p>So you see, they don't actually know if the vaccine is causing heart attacks. It's just because they choose to believe that it doesn't, that they conclude that it doesn't. There's no actual evidence of either.</p>
<p>That's like they're saying the earth is not round, thus it must be flat. If they never sail to "edge of the earth" to actually test this, then they can never be proven wrong.</p>

        <p>... why does someone with " a background in bureaucracy" believe they have any ability to weigh in on the affects of a vaccine? I have a background in toxicology and I know I don't have the resources to come to an informed opinion so how, exactly, are you?</p>
<p>Also, X is not known to cause Y is science speak for we're extremely certain that X doesn't cause Y but can't 100% prove it. Like the statement that walnuts are not known to cause cancer does not, by any means, suggest that there is a secret cabal of big walnut bidding their true carcinogenic nature.</p>

        <p>Because it makes me qualified to know when governments are using tricks and cons to misrepresent information, which is why they're doing right here. It has nothing to do with science, but with adjusting rules and regulations, and promoting specific people into positions of power and authority that will comply, to get the results they want.</p>
<p>For example Covid cases are counted differently in different countries, because they use different standards, counting and testing methods. If the science is so clear, then why is this even possible? Why does the US government encourage double masking, but other countries do not? Why was the Pfizer vaccine approved in just about every country, but India asked for a local test?</p>
<p>Do you think the US President picking the members of the Supreme Court or the Chairman of the Fed is based on science? Do you think Trump elected global warming deniers to set environmental policies because they were the most qualified?</p>
<p>And don't get me started on the legal side of all this, most lockdown fines and regulations in most countries have been proven to be illegal by the courts. Again this has nothing to do with science, and everything with government policy.</p>

        <p>My family and I are heading to myrtle beach next weekend. I heard that myrtle beach finally dropped the mask mandate for businesses. I'm happy about that but I'm wondering how many businesses will actually drop it and which ones will continue to virtue signal. Two of the places we want to go to have dropped the requirement. But according to the local sub, many places are still requiring them. And, of course, the resort we are staying at requires them indoors.</p>

        <p>Nobody here in Iowa really gives a shit about covid outside of the capitol and the college towns. The governor has said both "we're not doing vaccine passports." and "go get vaccinated". Its like "southern" Minnesota or "northern" Missouri, very "you do you and I'll do me and we just don't talk about it" kind of pluralism.</p>

        <p>I strongly think Kim Reynolds needs to be in the same breath as Desantis and Noem for how she handled things especially last summer.
She did great but needs to be the first to ban masks</p>

        <p>Hong Kong and Singapore are set to start a travel bubble. The funny thing is that Hong Kong will require its residents to be vaccinated, while Singapore will not.</p>
<p>This is silly, Hong Kong is willing to let untold Singaporeans in without vaccination, but is concerned its own citizens will get infected on the same travel route.</p>
<p>This shows that the government doesn't really care about safety precautions, but about forcing people to get vaccinated. Respect to Singapore for not pulling this kind of crap.</p>

        <p>I think it's overblown. Someone said elsewhere that population size is to blame. If you take 350,000 daily cases and divided it by 1.4 billion, then you get 0.00025, or 0.025% of the population infected daily. For comparison, 0.025% of the US population is 82,500. We've been teetering around that many new cases for almost the entire pandemic. If I had to guess, the situation in India is probably analogous to the US from late November to mid January, when we averaged ~200k cases per day. And if we're being honest, the country looked nothing like how the media is covering India right now.  </p>
<p>The question then is <em>why</em> they're doing this. There wasn't this much fearmongering when South Africa and UK were fighting their 'variants'.</p>

<p>The news, and television in general, is constantly looking for shocking new things to maintain your attention and viewership, so they can sell you to advertisers.</p>
<p>Neil Postman really digs into this in "Technopoly" and "The Disappearance of Childhood". Both books I recommend highly.</p>

        <p>I disagree that it's purely for attention and viewership. The media is a very useful tool for agenda setting. Obviously the shock and awe helps stories gain notoriety, but that's just a means to an end.  </p>
<p>I just posted my own theory to this sub, where in general I think the India stuff is so that we can roll back restrictions in the West while still "fighting the virus" elsewhere. As this transition takes place we'll talk more and more about climate change.</p>

        <p>Capitalism is the main reason <em>why</em> the media is an agenda setter. When you let money exchange hands freely, then naturally you're gonna get reporting that aligns with the wealthy elite agenda, because they understand the power that media holds. It's extremely unlikely that the media is a completely independent industry concerned only with its own profits, not when lobbying is a thing. Is there something that prevents lobbying of the media?</p>

        <p>Interesting, thanks for the input. So it's roughly the same as day-to-day life save for news coverage? That's how it is in the US. Our news coverage on India as outsiders is probably just as overblown, if not more.</p>

        <p>No, things are getting weird, police force being amped, and people my husband works with in factories are dying. But it's very nicely timed with the vaccination rollout, and lots of people around here sharing stories of relatives they know dying shortly after the injection...</p>

        <p>I feel like it’s probably, like most things, a bit of both. They are probably getting hit pretty hard, but I also doubt it’s as apocalyptic as the media’s making it out to be as well. I wonder if any Indian people are in this sub and can let us know.</p>

        <p>Old salts are saying this week is going to be good for morel foraging. Gonna go out to a couple of spots this week with the boy, there's a state woods and some nice traces where I can find them not too far out of the city. After last year's tree-killing derecho the mushrooms are going to be pitching a fit and popping up left and right. Wishing I could make it out there tomorrow but classes come first! They probably need another two days of warm to really start fruiting anyway, but if you don't get out there and pick em medium size someone else will get em, even as buttons.</p>

<p>I think my mental health has taken a slight dip as the days go on. Between the news and the constant reminders of this world, I'm starting to lose sleep. I don't like listening to the radio either. Take me up to the cabin and let me sit on the porch with my guitar and relax. This virus is so unfair and for as bad as it was before I kinda miss it... Sure it was kinda rough but now i don't think I can push through like I used to. This is not suicide, I just need a break from it all. 3 people I know close to me are never going to come back. This is so unfair.</p>

        <p>Jersey radio 101.5 has become a propaganda network. It's actually very funny to listen to the bias, they were never this bad.  </p>
<p>Today they had a segment about the J&amp;J vaccine and the side effects of it. They wanted you to call in and tell them if A. You'd get the Vaccine, and B. If you didn't why not?  </p>
<p>Of course those that called were all nurses, borderline hysterical. Telling the hosts about the endless list of close people they'd lost due to covid. Then a blue collar sounding guy called up and told the hosts "It's a psyop!". </p>
<p>Even the normal people who were called in the respectfully said they didn't want to vaccine were in one way or another told that they were a POS. The hosts then went on to speak about how high the death toll was now.</p>

        <p>I wrote this for a rant post but decided I'd rather not clog up the board.</p>
<hr>
<p>I work in a healthcare facility in a non-clinical role. Every morning I wake up wishing it was fall of 2019 again.</p>
<p>In January, my group of online friends and I caught several streams compiling media from China: screaming nurses, pictures of overrun hospitals, people seizing up - everything that didn't <em>actually</em> happen. We knew anything coming out of China was false but looked at it backwards. We believed the videos.</p>
<p>I live in nondescript Middle America. You might get a few looks or maybe one verbal exchange if you walk in a store without a mask, but most people I've run into aren't zealots. Occasionally someone (usually older) drives with their mask on, but you really don't see anyone who's gone off the deep end of the deep end. There aren't many restrictions, daily life isn't too affected. It's almost worse since it's accepted as just an annoyance rather than the unnecessary, damaging, and alarming overreach that it is. A dull hum instead of a klaxon.</p>
<p>Every other day at work, we get "updates" from a head M.D. (not a virologist) who took it upon himself to send emails. He closes his case-heavy, sometimes political messages with motivational quotes like he's come down from the mountain to us lesser beings. I have a filter set to automatically trash them. Groundskeeping was instructed to prepare a surge tent. It was never used. Employee health takes their job too seriously as expected - I'm waiting for the day I get berated as "anti-science" by the head nurse who previously gave me a tetanus shot.</p>
<p>My job hasn't been in jeopardy, I was never furloughed and wasn't made to ~~work from home~~ live at work. One person I know was unemployed, but only for two weeks when government first shut places down; his living situation didn't change in that time. Another got sick a few months ago and was mostly better by the third day of staying around the house. We hold solidarity in that all of us are strictly against the injection and aren't the types to bend the knee. </p>
<p>I wanted to go into healthcare because it was the most neutral field I could think of. I didn't want to end up working for a company that churns out overpriced trash. But over this last year, I've wanted to quit every day. Despite the legitimate treatments being performed, I find no comfort in knowing that I contribute the slightest bit to propping up this hellscape. I am inconsolably angry and downright hateful towards anyone whi legitimizes this joke. I've given up all of my goals and came to terms with dying alone. I have fully accepted that I will be dead by my own hand within the next two years. Anything to get out of this mess.</p>
<p>I know this was long and disjointed but thank you for reading. You people on this board and those like you are the only ones I respect anymore.</p>

        <p>So i finally get to go back to school in the fall which is great, but they're still gonna force us to wear masks which is ridiculous. With how many people are gonna be there a tiny piece of fabric isn't gonna do anything to stop a virus from spreading. Plus I am actually planning to get vaccinated so I don't understand why i would need a mask in that case. This whole situation is ridiculous and I'm just begging for the day everything will go back to how it should be</p>

        <p>When I read articles about people being injected with saline instead of vaccine by accident, I can't help but wonder how many of them already boasted in social media about getting the vaccine and how much better they feel already.</p>

        <p>I saw that the ufc entrance had signs for scanning a covid health pass. I was really excited there was going to be an event like that with no masks at full capacity but it looks like you needed to scan a health pass showing u have the vaccine or a negative test. Does anyone know? Im just curious.</p>

        <p>Yeah its just dana white made a point of making it a big deal that there was going to be a crowd with no masks so i didnt think hed sell out and then require a health pass. I would think if ufc requires it then the NBA will def require it.</p>

        <p>From a GLP Post in 2014<br>
"Whether this virus is real or fake or being over-hyped or under-hyped, really doesn't matter in regards to the implementation of their wanted international system, as long as they can make/let the virus spread (if real/under-hyped) OR seem like a real major threat (if fake/over-hyped), enough to implement the required multi-phase "response" protocols on an international level.<br>
When looking at this virus/outbreak, you must keep in mind the elites wanted goals, and their intended method to get it... Order Out Of Chaos (Ordo ab Chao)... If you understand their end-game and the implementation method, it should become fairly clear that this current "creeping" virus/outbreak (again whether real or fake) is the perfect scenario for the WHO/UN to implement several MAJOR elements of their wanted international New World Order system, all done in a way that is "justified" as being "required".</p>

        <p>I think it does matter that the virus has been over-hyped.  Being over-hyped is really what this is all about.</p>
<p>It's not about public health.  It is about propaganda, control, money and power, and possibly about population control, depending upon the long term effects of the mRNA manipulation.</p>

        <p>Well it's happening - I'm getting the Moderna vax. Not happy about it but my family said I wouldn't be invited to gatherings with kids/baby family members unless I got it. And they know I had symptomatic Covid-19 only a few months ago so I have the anti-bodies yet that isn't good enough. I still don't trust the vaccine and am skeptical of big pharma's role in this plandemic. Also it angers me that my Gov is using some unknown percentage of people vaccinated as dangling carrot for MAYBE reopening. Besides the fact that lifting of mitigation rules and civil liberties suspensions shouldn't be dependent of people's willingness to take an experimental vax it doesn't even take into account herd immunity from recovered covid-19 cases of which I am one out of 1,108,188 in PA. So frustrating. What a tyrant. 15 days to stop the spread yea right.</p>

        <p>I may end up in the same position. I have a feeling at least some of my family would demand vaccine before meeting in person. While I'd like to seem them again, my answer to any demand that I be vaccinated will be <em>no</em>. Maybe we could negotiate something--say a meeting outside, with masks. If not, contact can stay electronic. I will <em>not</em> get a vaccine to make them happy. Likewise, I don't demand they make health decisions that I approve of (and this goes far beyond the vaccine question or even anything directly related to COVID).</p>

        <p>Tell them you got the vaccine, don’t get the vaccine if you don’t want it. Especially if their reassigning is that there’s kids around. Kids are practically immune to Covid. If there’s really old people too then maybe consider the vaccine, but if you’ve already been sick it’s kinda pointless.</p>

        <p>If you must be honest, explain very clearly that 1.) you will not be getting the vaccine until it is FDA approved. That way you’re not a crazy antivaxer, you’re just not sure about eua. 
2.) even with the vaccine there is a chance of transmission 
3.) their children are totally safe from Covid unless they have some very serious comorbidities. Look up the numbers in your region, where I am there have been 0 deaths below age 40. </p>
<p>It’s not fair for them to ask you something you don’t feel comfortable doing in the name of protecting their kids, when the vaccine won’t protect their kids.</p>

        <p>It's ... not an anecdote. You know what an anecdote is, right? https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/covid-19-claims-teenagers-life-1.6002023</p>
<p>You said children are "totally safe" from Covid, which is untrue. If you mean that statistically children are an age group that is highly likely to survive, yes, that's true!  But the risk is not zero. It would be accurate to say children are "low risk", but not "totally safe".</p>
<p>Yes, children can get killed by those things you listed and more, which is why we take precautions against them. I have a much higher chance of dying in a car crash than being killed by a wild animal, but I still take precautions when I encounter them.</p>

        <p>Do you wear a helmet when you drive? It would make you safer but would be unnecessary. Do you put you child’s steak through a food processor? It would make it safer, but it’s unnecessary. </p>
<p>One story, even if proven, is still anecdotal evidence. Real evidence is crunching the numbers and getting a survival rate, icu admission, and hospitalization rate that rounds to 0.000 for that age group.</p>
<p>Edit: “Anecdotal evidence is a factual claim relying only on personal observation, collected in a casual or non-systematic manner.” There’s nothing systematic about your claim.</p>

<p>I don’t agree that those 3700 kids make Covid anything other than totally safe. One death in ten or one hundred thousand confirmed cases is too small to consider dangerous. In my province it’s 0 total deaths below 20, and 0.0 per 100 thousand below 30, with rounding. Hospitalization is similarly low, being 4.7% below age 1 and 0.5% up to 4, 0.3% up to 10 and 0.5% up to 20. The only group I would consider it to be reasonable to be concerned about is under age 1. Even then it’s a stretch to say that this guy is A) gonna get Covid a second time and B) going to transmit the disease before he notices symptoms and isolates and C) the child gets severely sick. With the three events combined you’re looking at odds that probably round to 0.0000%</p>

        <p>I understand, thanks for your reply! I didn't think you were basing your opinion on unreasonable things. I agree the risk is very low;  I just meant we need to be careful about how we word things. Now I am feeling like I am just arguing semantics, (which may be true) but I do think it can make a difference. </p>
<p>For example, even though I support vaccines, I wouldn't say they're totally safe, as there is a risk, however small. Though many things we do are "safe", few things are totally safe, and I do think it's important to acknowledge that so we can make informed decisions. </p>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time to explain your reasoning!</p>

        <p>Lmao are you following me around? Imo the family is being unreasonable to say that he can’t see their kids without a vaccine. I would understand if they said that he can’t see grandpa who’s 70 and smokes, or if he can’t see Timmy who has asthma. But family telling you you can’t see them if you don’t make a certain medical choice is also quite unreasonable in this case.</p>

        <p>&rt;Also it angers me that my Gov is using some unknown percentage of people vaccinated as dangling carrot for MAYBE reopening.</p>
<p>I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that reopening. Again and again, I've heard lies and promises in my state...which get reneged on. Starting with the shutdown for two weeks to flatten the curve. </p>
<p>No matter what people do, it will never be enough for the emperor of a state. In this case, with the vaccinations, there will probably never be enough vaccinations. "Oh, we'd to reopen, but we only got 99.99999% compliance! If the percentage is "unknown" it makes it even less likely they'll reopen. Or else there will be: "We got our target--but The Science now says it's not enough. We now need to <strong><em>_</em></strong>_____!!!!"</p>

        <p>I know that masks are not as useful as the government wants us to believe and I always wear N95 to medical appointments or surgical, no dirty cloths. 
If you read my previous posts you can understand my reasons to be afraid (tldr, I had Covid and was terrible, don't want to catch this again). </p>
<p>That being said, my fear now is not only catching the virus itself again but one of those mutations that were probably a result of this very vaccination programme. Actually, I am afraid of catching it again from a vaccinated asymptomatic doctor or something like that. </p>
<p>I will not take the vaccine as the trial didn't include long covid patients (and everything is just fishy AF) and I cannot risk myself to catch a random alien mutation.</p>
<p>My point here is that I am angry and sad. Here in the UK the vaccination programme is insane. I pray this to work but chances are we are going to have the worst wave ever next winter. Mutations and people believing that they're immune. Or that a cloth mask protects them. This shit is fucked up. </p>
<p>What do you think about this? Specially the whole "catching alien mutations" thing.</p>

        <p>the vaccine does boost your immune system. vaccines are literally injecting small traces of covid so our immune system can fight it off and gain the "memory white blood cells" to fight off covid when we actually come into contact with a carrier. without the initial vaccine your immune system doesn't know what it's fighting. you're walking into the battlefield with no combat training. go to bootcamp and get trained (vaccinated) if you want to survive the war. to just freeball it and wing it with no vaccine... you're asking to get your nuts shot off.</p>

        <p>No dude. The shot is only intended for original strains. Seems to be a little known fact that this in turn dominates inside your immune sys, rendering all your other immunities useless, no NK's, no innate response. As well as mutate and shedding.

        <p>no shit. i gave vastly simplified explanation because i don't believe many of you fucks will even listen in the first place. but i did explain the general gist of how it works in hopes that maybe it'll click with one of you. obviously not you so fuck off. and if you're gonna come at me like... 🤓👆 "ThAt's nOT hOw mRNA VaCciNeS wOrK." i'd like to point out that you don't know how masks work. they do work... you're just dumb and choose not to view actual scientific evidence that they do in fact work.</p>

<p>"First, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are given in the upper arm muscle. Once the instructions (mRNA) are inside the immune cells, the cells use them to make the protein piece. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them.
Next, the cell displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune systems recognize that the protein doesn’t belong there and begin building an immune response and making antibodies, like what happens in natural infection against COVID-19.
At the end of the process, our bodies have learned how to protect against future infection. The benefit of mRNA vaccines, like all vaccines, is those vaccinated gain this protection without ever having to risk the serious consequences of getting sick with COVID-19."</p>
<p>yes... i was wrong in the terminology i used. it is in fact mRNA in the injection and not a small dose of covid like i said before. the response from that injection however does create memory cells that circulate through your body dormant for several years ready for the autoimmune response if covid does enter your body. </p>
<p>as for spreading hate. i apologize. i shouldn't be so mean when all i seek is to help the naive  people on this sub towards the legitimate truth. </p>
<p>as for spreading misinformation. that's entirely ironic coming from an anti-masker. you can quite literally test the effectiveness of masks with diy home experiments. please do so.</p>

        <p>Well... I have some good and bad news for you.  Bad news this could going around like seasonal flu.  The good news is mutations are typically to less deadly.   The other good news is you likely have immunity for variants as well.  Stop the worry and enjoy your life.</p>

        <p>I know that masks are useful and that's why I wear them, but I don't trust that they can protect me 100% against catching this virus. That's why I'm worried of catching it again even wearing a N95 mask. </p>
<p>And my fear is mostly how my natural immunity will react to the new mutant variants. Looking at what's happening in India and meanwhile people acting as the pandemic ended because they had a dodgy vax and wear a cloth mask, well, probably I am being pessimistic but I just don't see how the next winter is going to be any better. </p>
<p>Hope I'm wrong.</p>

<p>That's true, they aren't 100% effective! Sorry if I seemed confrontational, just wanted to post the info not only for you but for everyone because most in this subreddit do NOT know that masks are useful.</p>

I didn't know VAERS was a thing before browsing here. Interesting stuff, but also very inflated numbers, just like how [everyone here claims] the COVID deaths are inflated.</p>

        <p>I don't know anyone directly who got COVID; my social circle is fairly small (like, 5 people).<br>
At my workplace (probably at least a few hundred employees) there were a few deaths, but luckily nobody in my department (which is maybe 20 people). Although, for full disclosure for you conspiracists, I'm a US govt contractor which means:<br>
1. "my workplace" is "the government"<br>
2. Lots of old people (high risk)</p>
<p>Everyone in my circle has gotten the vaccine (including myself) so I think my chances of getting it are negligible. Nobody I know had any negative effects outside of the sickness anyone experiences shortly after a vaccine—I think everybody's gotten the Moderna one.</p>
<p>If I had gotten it, I'd like to think I'd be okay. I'm not in any risk category and I've always had a strong immune system.</p>

        <p>The same I think about any group that divides on a topic.<br>
Echo chambers and confirmation bias are ruthless.</p>
<p>Using my example above:<br>
NNN and the conspiracy sub are both willing to use logic to reason the mortality rate is lower due to overreporting, but suspend that same logic when it comes to the vaccine's adverse effects.</p>
<p>Just like with democrats vs republicans, people tend to only scratch the surface until they get what they want to bolster their argument and then stop. This sub is no different.</p>
<p>My biggest issue with this sub (putting aside some rant of "get over yourselves") is the straw man, putting words into mouths, or name-calling ("sheep" comes to mind).</p>
<p>I constantly see "But they're all too scared" in regards to:<br>
1. Not confronting somebody not wearing a mask.<br>
2. Why I wear a mask<br>
3. Why I got the vaccine<br>
4. Probably more.</p>
<p>When in reality:<br>
1. It's not my job. I don't work at the grocery store. If I did, I would say something.<br>
2. It both requires a negligible amount of time/effort and could potentially save somebody - if not their life, then their income and bills by not putting them out of work and into a hospital for a day or two.<br>
3. Simply put: nothing I've seen gives me any cause for concern.</p>
<p>I think it's great to have a healthy distrust of the government and big corporations, but don't be a yutz about it.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, the folks here will point you to VAERS but ignore the big warnings on the VAERS homepage saying that all adverse events after vaccination are reported, whether coincidence or not, whether verified or not, and no causal link is implied or established by their reporting.</p>

        <p>Almost like how testing positive for COVID and then dying doesn't imply or establish a causal link, but do you think that's going to stop that death from being added to the tally for COVID deaths?</p>
<p>VAERS is estimated to report 1% of all vaccine adverse events. Assuming the proportions of deaths, hospitalizations, etc. remains the same, that would mean there are 318,600 deaths associated with COVID vaccines. Now, I don't believe that COVID vaccines have caused 318,600 deaths. I don't believe they've caused a tenth of that. To attribute all of those deaths to the vaccines just because they occurred after taking the vaccine would be a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. But for the same reason, I also don't believe COVID-19 has caused 571,000 deaths.</p>
<p>You have to have the same standard for both numbers. You don't get to change it depending on which one you're talking about.</p>

        <p>I haven't had a flu shot in 14 years. I was perpetually sick every winter until the year I procrastinated and missed my flu shot. Didn't even get one cold that whole winter. Skipped the next year, nothing. Haven't had a flu shot since.</p>
<p>I have been sick since, but now it's once every year or two as opposed to several times a year.</p>
<p>So, I'm in no hurry to get the covid shot, at least not until a year or two has passed so I can observe any side-effects.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/mx8bzp/still_confused_about_masks_heres_the_science/gvmmcoc/">I ran into a liberal here who's completely bought into the fear-mongering anti-white socialist DemoncRAT-run Lamestream Fake News media narrative about masks</a>. The moderators are actively censoring my voice so I can't reply to it directly. So I'll just reply in this thread and hope that /u/Descendent_of_Cain will see it:</p>
<p>I'm not sure why this sub is filled with so many globalists. With all due respect, it seems like you've completely bought into the liberal fear-mongering propaganda that the socialist government is spewing these days.</p>
<p>The second link is from the AAPS, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_American_Physicians_and_Surgeons">which is an irredeemably woke hyper-politically-charged anti-white anti-science leftist libtard organization as you can read about here</a>; NOTHING they say should ever be trusted.</p>
<p>The 1st source is pertinent to a healthcare environment rather than for the general public. In addition, it was updated in 2020 as follows:</p>
<p>"Health workers are asking us if they should wear no mask at all if cloth masks are the only option. Our research does not condone health workers working unprotected. We recommend that health workers should not work during the COVID-19 pandemic without respiratory protection as a matter of work health and safety. In addition, if health workers get infected, high rates of staff absenteeism from illness may also affect health system capacity to respond. Some health workers may still choose to work in inadequate PPE. In this case, the physical barrier provided by a cloth mask may afford some protection, but likely much less than a surgical mask or a respirator."</p>
<p>The 3rd source contains a follow-up where the authors clarify their true position on masks (hint: <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2020836">it's not what the commie media wants you to believe!</a>).</p>
<p>The 4th source is interesting and I'll take a closer look at it.</p>
<p>The 5th source links to a communist think tank where they basically pay "intellectuals" to provide "evidence" for their leftist narrative. Just like with the AAPS, these woke libtards shouldn't be trusted. (I don't know if you know how think tanks work, but at best, they're about as credible as CNN).</p>
<p>The 6th source is entertaining because it was submitted to the bogus woke journal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Hypotheses">"Medical Hypotheses"</a> that literally accepts any paper, no matter how ridiculous, as long as it's grammatically coherent. In other words, this paper belongs in the trash bin.</p>
<p>So you've only provided one worthwhile source. I'll get back to you about it later on, but your case really isn't looking good for now.</p>

        <p>Dam, look at you trying to make a scientific argument, without posting any science literature to begin the debate. </p>
<p>Also, I might add that when you start a debate with insults, you're not in a good position to begin an intelligent debate. 
It seems like you've already concluded and just want to attack. </p>
<p>If you want a debate with a "conspiracy theorist", then fire away. Happy to forget your little brain farts earlier.

        <p>I don't understand why people can't just wear a mask and hold their distances. The sooner we all do that, the sooner the cases will drop and we all can go back to normal life.
The people not wearing masks... and breaking the restrictions ARE the reason why we have this (not the sceptical ones! You can be against lockdown but still wear a mask etc. - this even helps)</p>

        <p>Not sure if you're looking for an actual response, but the concern, if I'm understanding properly, is:</p>
<p>There's an escalation of "infringing on freedoms."<br>
<strong>At first:</strong> Self isolate if you feel sick.<br>
<strong>Then:</strong> Wear a mask, even if you don't feel sick<br>
<strong>Then:</strong> Isolate at home, even if you don't feel sick<br>
<strong>Now:</strong> Get this vaccine, even if you've never personally know anyone that's been sick, also, still wear a mask and isolate.</p>
<p>You saying "if you just do this one thing, it'll all be over" but then saying "okay, but one more thing, THEN it'll all be over."<br>
Plus it sounds similar to, "Hand over all your money, and nobody will get hurt." The idea being that both are used by people with force using fear to control somebody.</p>

        <p>You have perfectly described most people's issues with this situation!</p>
<p>Also, I <em>really</em> take issue with the "if you just did what they told you, they wouldn't be punishing everyone right now." Many people with dysfunctional childhoods will recognize it from memories of their siblings saying "if you just would have done X, he wouldn't be hitting mom right now".</p>
<p>It's not my fault you can't go to a fucking concert!</p>

        <p>How are you going to beat the virus then? And you don't have to get a vaccine - it just makes sense for you. Also, don't be an asshole. Yes I see the risks of a vaccine. But fr, the chance of dying from Covid are by far higher</p>
<p>But if you don't want your vaccine, I'd take it. Or ask a person in India. I don't think people even think of not taking a vaccine because it's literally hell rn for them.</p>

        <p>Wdym? If you're talking about India: the cases were going low so people thought that everyone was safe from the virus (idk the English name for it, when enough were Ill so that they have anti-genes and the virus can't spread) and the restrictions were lowered.  Also they had the Holi festival where much people gathered - so the virus is spreading pretty quickly. 340k cases in 24h ...  Just look it up</p>
<p>And if you say that being against the restrictions and because of this not taking your distance, you are pretty funny. Because that's how the virus gets transmitted</p>

        <p>Yes, I hate lockdown etc. 
But as long as people don't act socially this won't change. Yes, people suffer financially from the lockdown - but I'm not sure if not wearing a mask (and spreading the virus) is really helping those people</p>

        <p>Covid deaths are inflated and everyone who dies is marked as a covid death for the past year. So no, wearing a mask doesn’t compute with us that it’s less likely killing more people by wearing it when the whole fucking thing is a farse. If you think “covid” “killed” “500,000” “people” we can’t have this conversation. You’re all blind</p>

        <p>You know the flu can also kill people right?  Same with cars?  You’ve been okay with selfishly putting people in danger of dying from those things for years.  Maybe we should liquidise all food to reduce the choking hazard.  At some point, you have to ask yourself what level of dystopia is worth saving ‘just one life’.</p>
