        <p>Good thing I wasn’t a compliant little sheep. In April I was going for hikes, sometimes over 30 mins from my house in NY. My parents have doomer attitudes they allowed me to hang out with my friends outside by May and attend college in FL. I find it quite interesting my parents complain about others gathering yet never bat an eye when I want to do something in person. I was hanging out with friends, sometimes several times a week, last summer. We went to the beach, NYC, on hikes, and around town. In hindsight, this was one of the better summers I’ve had. It’s too bad so many in my generation were brainwashed to put their lives on hold.</p>

        <p>Yeah - when I was a lad most of the kids I grew up with were dumb as a post. Inculcating them with the mainstream narrative was a slow process as it had to be done through culture like film and TV but even then it was a slow process - analytics and feedback in the system to the elites was very slow. Back in the late 90's and early 00's - gaming was about gaming not woke left wing politics and we used to play outside and most of us didn't give a shit about what was going on in the wider world. We would get on our bikes and go off somewhere - do tricks, climb trees, shoot our bb guns. Now social media feeds the mainstream agenda right into kids heads most waking hours of the day - the way social media works incentivises them to go along with it because to comply is to be virtuous and the elites can get instant feedback as to how well the narratives are working and what pressure to apply. </p>
<p>My nephew is 12 at the moment and he is probably a very high functioning aspergers like I am so he doesn't really get on with the LARP that mainstream society is. I have been slowly red pilling him. I have focused on introducing him to manly pursuits and training him on the tools. His mother is horrified but she couldn't deal with him during the lockdown. She is a single mother and can't believe he behaves in my presence.</p>

        <p>Yep the lockdown has given the younger generation no choice but to just get blasted with propoganda and thought manipulation via social media likes all day by their phones and computers, anyone who isn't aware of it has received so much of it at this point I do worry for them. Thankfully I have managed to surround myself with like minded people and most of my friends immediately thought this was bs when it started, I have tried my best to keep in contact with the ones who eat it all up but it gets really annoying when they're fretting about how close I stand to them and wearing a mask and shit like that so I've had to cut most of them out unfortunately. It's good you've got your nephew out of the perpetual loop of fear and into some more meaningful pursuits, small things like that will do wonders for his development so great stuff!</p>

        <p>Yeah - I have lost a fair few friendships this year - some of them of over 15 years because I didn't go along with the COVID narrative. </p>
<p>I'm glad I know a lot of people at work and in my personal life who see through the elites and their games. Besides YouTube I have no social media on my phone. I quit all social media a few years ago for the most part was very good for me but I do come by reddit sometimes to see what is going on. I can't wait till Linux phones improve over the next few years and I will probably ditch Google all together. </p>
<p>I have some understanding of what the elites are programming young peoples brains with and it horrifies me. If this carries on I don't know if we can beat the elites.</p>

        <p>I wonder if when it comes down to it, that they’ll really have to pay these fines. I would hope it’s like a vehicle registration ticket - you go to court and if you got it done by that time they’ll usually dismiss it.</p>

        <p>Probably weren't actually fined. The news have been making this shit up. I've literally been to a rave that got shut down by the police &amp; was portrayed in the media as having been fined. But no one actually got fined. The media keeps pushing this dialogue to scare people into submission.</p>
