        <p>This is a great documentary if you haven't seen it already. In it, Russo discusses his conversations with a Rockefeller family member who bragged about the elites' plan for us, and the plan isn't sunshine, unicorns, and owning nothing but being happy about it.</p>
<p>You can also read a Rockefeller report from 2010 that discusses a "fictional" scenario in the event of a global pandemic. The scenario is called "lockstep" which sounds eerily similar to the top down authoritarian control we're seeing today all over the planet, particularly in the west.</p>
<p>The lockstep scenario begins on page 18 in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzxi324UZCscVWp2YjdaNXlUNEk/edit">this report titled "Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development."</a>  The whole thing is interesting, but I found "lockstep" of particular interest and also "clever together" (beginning on page 26) which sounds remarkably like "build back better."  Think about the world today and governmental responses everywhere.  "Lockstep" is the perfect word to describe the coordinated effort to restrict our freedoms, travel, and ability to earn a  living.</p>
<p>People need to understand that the events of this year are not a coincidence or an accident.  These things are planned by the elites well in advance.  If more people understood this fact, the elites wouldn't be able to mess up our lives so badly on a recurring basis because the people would fight it.  As it stands now, the elites have successfully primed the public to dismiss those of us who follow these things as "conspiracy theorists", a CIA invented term originally used to dismiss those who questioned the Warren Commission report on JFK's assassination.</p>
