    <strong>What are your thoughts on the situation unfolding in India?</strong>
    <p><p>Please don't downvote me just because you don't agree with me, I want to have a sensible discussion. </p>
<p>As you probably know, India is in an extremely bad situation with Covid at the moment. Hundreds of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths every day (although the actual figures are likely much higher). Hospitals are running out of oxygen and people are dying in the streets because there's nowhere they can go to get treated. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister of India is refusing to put the country into lockdown, instead relying on vaccines to get the country out of this.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the situation, and the lack of restrictions in place? If you wouldn't want to see a lockdown in India - how do you propose they bring cases and deaths down?</p></p>

        <p>It’s depressing that we live in a society that only cares when the media tells us to. I’m not there so I can’t say exactly what’s going on. But a completely average day in India depending on where you are looks like dead bodies casually in the street, before any of this happened. Did you care then?</p>

<p>Hold on. I don't know where you got this impression but I have to say that this is a gross misrepresentation of what daily life is like in India. Yes, there is significant disparity between rich and poor. But it's not an everyday war torn wasteland. What we're seeing now with hospitals being overrun and having to turn people away so that all they can do is die in the street is unprecedented. It's <em>now</em> comparable to a state of war. This isn't as simple as "Well this isn't that unusual for parts of India". It really, really is unusual.</p>

        <p>I hate to break it to you, and I don’t mean that literally everywhere you go in India is dead bodies scattered everywhere, but that’s why I said depending on where you are because this truly is typical of India. The air pollution is so horrible (in some places) that it makes it absolutely unbearable to breathe already and in those places people are crammed in like sardines and if you walk down the wrong side street you will see a body or two. How do you lock that down? I know several people who have been and this is what they witnessed. Also, I hate to turn the world wasteland against you, but there’s quite literally a ton a ton of waste everywhere, just garbage and plastic lying around because they are not able to sufficiently dispose of it. I’m not saying that this is the ultimate and total reality of the whole country but it’s really bad in certain areas.</p>

        <p>Of course I cared. Nobody should have to live in poverty or not have access to proper medical care and education. There isn't much I can do about it, but I do empathise with the people of India who don't live in the kind of luxury we take for granted.</p>

        <p>Then you should think about the fact that majority of people in countries like India simply cannot practically live in the state of a lockdown like those in the western world have. It simply comes down to, do you believe that the government should have the ability to control your actions and your livelihood, as well as your freedom to move as you please, or not? The people in this sub believe not. If you don’t feel that way, I suppose it’s only a difference of fundamental beliefs.</p>

        <p>I fully agree that if people have fundamentally different views about the role of government, then fair enough.</p>
<p>But it's worth highlighting that India went into a severe, albeit very difficult lockdown in 2020 and did a good job stemming excess death from Covid last year. So in terms of saying India cannot be locked down, there is very recent evidence to the contrary. Easy? No. Possible? Yes.</p>

        <p>Sorry to respond to you twice, but I'd be curious to know you're opinion on one more thing. </p>
<p>One key point on which we probably differ is that we probably believe in basic freedoms, but I believe they should be curtailed if they impinge on the freedom of others. So for me, restricting my movement to help prevent the spread of Covid is a burden, but it preserves the right to life of my fellow citizens at a time when some of those citizens' right to life could be otherwise under serious threat. Similarly, fully exercising my freedom of movement at this time would impinge on the right to life of others. </p>
<p>If going into the office helps me exercise my right to earn a living, but temporarily risks perpetuating a virus that would impact my fellow citizens' right to life, then my right to go to the office is temporarily void because at the moment it could grossly jeopardise the rights of others.</p>
<p>In the same way, I'd love to drive as fast as I want or not wear a seatbelt and happily take on that risk to my own life, because that's my choice. But, doing so would impact the freedom and rights of others. So I don't.</p>
<p>What's your view on personal rights impacting the rights of others?</p>

        <p>There are worse viruses out there that no one cared about. No one shut down the country for 14 months for tuberculosis, swine flu, polio, HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, Ebola, Zika virus, etc. </p>
<p>Going by the doomer logic, at any time in your life, if you went to school or worked with a cold or flu, you may be indirectly responsible for spreading it to
Someone who spread it to someone who spread it to someone who died.</p>
<p>This virus is real, but it’s been overblown. It is creating a creepy dystopian police state, and the impact of doing this will last generations to come. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we now have 3 vaccines readily available, and anyone who wants one can sign up to get one. Literally everyone who is afraid or concerned at this time should be at least partially vaccinated by now, and if they are old or medically vulnerable they have had months to get both doses. There is absolutely no reason to keep mandating masks in my state (California), where like 55% of all people have at least gotten their first shot. </p>
<p>Your example of seatbelts and speeding limits are permanent measures. Do you seriously want to permanently have masks become mandatory by law, like a seatbelt or a speed limit? Furthermore, where I live, no one respects the speed limit when there is no traffic. Speed limit is 65, and most people go over 70, if not 80. No one is universally adhering to speed limit laws. </p>
<p>It’s been about 14 months now. Your argument that it’s temporary, along with your example of <strong>permanent</strong> measures (speed limit) and the terminology of “new normal” and not “temporary sacrifice” act as evidence that this is <em>not</em> a temporary or short term thing. It will likely be several more months, or 2022, until masks are dropped in California (btw June 15 is just to loosen restrictions: masks will still be mandatory). </p>
<p>And if you say “iT’s JuSt A pIeCe Of ClOtH” then you should do like me, and wear one 40-60 hours a week non stop for The next 400 days, and ask for permission whenever you drink or eat.</p>

        <p>Ok, so there are a lot of questionable comparisons here. I can't go into detail on all of them, but here are some:</p>
<p>Please don't compare a sexually transmitted disease like HIV to a far more transmissible airborne virus. Furthermore, the world absolutely <em>did</em> lose it's shit over HIV. It lasted for decades. The United States restricted the immigration of people with HIV until <em><em>2010</em></em>.</p>
<p>Similarly with Zika and Ebola, migration restrictions were significant. The Fifa World Cup and Olympic Games were in jeopardy because of the former. But again, these are not fully viable comparisons. For instance, Zika is transmitted by mosquitos and mostly impacts children in utero.</p>
<p>A 2022 lifting of restrictions - whether that's accurate or not I don't know - is still temporary. A sub-two year pandemic in the Western World is an incredible result by historical standards when compared to other pandemics.</p>
<p>Regarding vaccines, India has only approved two, not three. And they are absolutely not available to everyone India. For every person in India who has received a vaccine dose, 7 people in the USA have received a dose. This is despite the fact that India is the world's biggest producer of vaccines. </p>
<p>These are not good faith arguments. You are letting your opinion of the pandemic in your own country distract from the theme of this thread, which is about the Covid situation in India. You are making comparisons that are not relevant to the thread.</p>

<p>Right. But who said that there were co dependencies between the US and India situation?

        <p>It’s alright, I appreciate a healthy discussion from two people who have differing opinions. I think we need to see a lot more of that in today’s world. I think the car analogy is a useful one in this scenario actually. Consenting parties only choose to go out onto the road and participate in risking their lives. Likewise, when you go out in today’s world, you are consenting to taking a risk on your life if your concern is catching covid. All parties are participating in public activities with their own risk assessment. If they are exercising their personal discretion and sovereignty and do not mind the risk.... why should all parties be restricted from this freedom of personal choice? </p>
<p>Should it not be the responsibility of the parties who are afraid of the risk to simply just.... stay inside? If you choose to go to the office, you are only hypothetically affecting those who... also chose to go to the office. I think a lot of those who are truly well meaning in wanting to protect the vulnerable do not understand the magnitude of allowing governments to infringe upon their rights, ability to put money in the bank, etc. They no doubt in my mind and soul have horrible ulterior motives. Just look at Ontario. They are prohibiting the sale of clothing, kitchen supplies, etc. for your own good...? Really? The cops can ask you where you’re going for literally any reason for your own good? Really?! This is not to mention the unending list of unintended, inhumane harms that stem from unethical lockdowns. Missed cancer screenings, child abuse going unnoticed by teachers who typically report it, struggling parents not being able to have the advantage of sending their kids to in person school creating even more economic hardship, children becoming developmentally dysfunctional as a result of lack of interaction and proper education, the elderly being completely isolated from any interaction in their dying days, the lost truly goes in forever. No one who supports lockdowns seems to bat an eye about this unending list.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why the answer people want to keep going to is to halt all activity everywhere. We are humans, we function by being around each other and being productive and social. We do not function crammed into a box, stripped of livelihoods, social connections, and told what to do by infamously rich people. This is how a dysfunctional society comes to be. No one is stopping you from staying at home if you have a concern about your own personal risk! Also the demonstrated effectiveness of lockdowns is a whole other conversation.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your answer. You make some good points.</p>
<p>&rt; Should it not be the responsibility of the parties who are afraid of the risk to simply just.... stay inside?</p>
<p>If it were that simple, I'd agree with you. I think I've learned through this pandemic that the vulnerable can't fully shield themselves. It's a nice idea, but not really practical. If it were truly possible, nursing homes would've been a paradise during this. You'd have had all the vulnerable people in the world conveniently clustered together and isolated. Then the rest of the world would've been able to largely ignore Covid. But, it didn't turn out that way. The virus killed people in nursing homes in huge numbers the world over because people on the outside allowed it to spread, giving the virus more opportunities to penetrate that shield and reach the most vulnerable time and again. For me, that's when individual rights start to impede the rights of others without their consent and we have to adopt a collective duty to restrict our movements and protect the vulnerable. What are your thoughts on this? It's pretty much the story of the pandemic for me: Fuck me, there are people way worse off who won't make it through this if they catch it, so I should suffer a little so that they can survive. I'll get over it.</p>
<p>Your skepticism of authority is interesting. The notion that if you give the authorities an inch (e.g. Ontario), you'll never get that back. Are you American or Canadian? Regardless, in my country the restrictions were even worse than Ontario. Police checkpoints, 5km travel limits, no non-essential retail for over 100 days. Bars that don't sell food have been closed in my city for over 400 days. But now our incidence of Covid is -95% relative to our peak, and because of the slow rollout of vaccines here we can strongly attribute that to the lockdown. And now, all of those restrictions are being lifted. Non-essential retail is back. The checkpoints are gone. The travel restrictions are gone. The bars are opening.</p>
<p>We've paid a huge price, but it was the lesser of two evils, and I think we're starting to see here that although the restrictions seemed unending...they are in fact, ending. I never thought I wouldn't get that inch back when I gave it over to society. I wonder why you think restrictions are ultimately based on an ulterior motive, or likely to be permanent?</p>

        <p>I get that point too. That's why the situation is so difficult - not doing anything will cause untold suffering and deaths, but locking down for the length of time required to bring this under control would also be similarly harmful.</p>
<p>My thoughts are that they could impose partial restrictions (ban mass gatherings, mask wearing, only meet up in small groups etc.) whilst trying as hard as possible to get vaccines out quickly. What are your ideas?</p>

<p>It's not that simple. India has been spending the last 70 years climbing out of the shithole that colonialism left it in. They just don't have the money to have a healthcare system like we do.</p>

<p>No, but your healthcare system is, for the most part, very good. Expensive, but good. India doesn't have a good healthcare system in most places.</p>

        <p>So you’re a kid. You don’t have to work and likely don’t have kids of your own, so you don’t understand how important it is to work and be able to support your family. Imagine if your parent/ guardian suddenly couldn’t financially support you anymore and you had to go live in your car. You wouldn’t have the energy to worry about Covid, which will 99.9999% do no harm to you. Instead, you would be worried about how to get your next meal, where to use the bathroom, where to charge your phone, where to sleep for the night, how to make sure you don’t miss your bills for things like the phone, safety, etc. You would have much more terrifying and serious things to worry about.</p>

        <p>The question isn’t “should the government support people who have lost their jobs?”.</p>
<p>The question is “<em>will</em> the government support people who have lost their jobs by not just matching their income but also providing ample savings for them to use whilst looking for jobs in the economy that the government deliberately crashed”. </p>
<p>And the answer is, almost all the time, “no”. Even if they provide financial assistance, it doesn’t mean they are matching the income of whoever lost work. AND  providing extra money in case their job loss is permanent and they have to spend several months looking for work in a dilapidated economy.</p>

Yeah, savings are a nice safety buffer, but in an ideal world, these would already exist and the government would provide support so people don't have to dip into their savings just to get by.</p>
<p>I can see where you're coming from, though - the government is probably not going to provide adequate support to everyone who needs it. That's unfortunate. But I don't believe it's an excuse to let Covid run amok.</p>

        <p>Because the government let the economy go to shambles. It isn’t like 2019 anymore (which still kind of sucked, at least in the USA, because we never fully recovered from 2008). Competition to find a job is now even more intense and cutthroat and the time required to find one is double</p>

<p>therefore I suspect; the media is fearmongering, certains politicians are politicking.  </p>

        <p>Many people in India live in extreme poverty. The situation there has never been good. Those people need food more than a vaccine. As far as burning bodies out in the open, that's been a practice for a long time. Seems like they are just currently under the media spotlight and they figured out a way to twist the normal causes of death and call it Covid. The media is a cabal of dark magicians who can spin a tale and call it a reality.</p>

        <p>I think the issue of death by diarrhea is more than a basic sanitation issue. A lack of access to clean water affects more than 10% of the world's population.  It shouldn't be so hard to get people clean water, and yet sadly here we are. </p>
<p>Conversely, we can stop the spread of Covid just by staying inside.</p>

        <p>I think the media is painting a very dishonest picture.</p>
<p>The outdoor cremations for one. Just do a quick Google search for me real quick. "Before:2020 India outdoor cremations"</p>
<p>You will find hundreds of articles about the practice. It's very common to build pyres in India to crematebthe dead outside. In fact, it's not uncommon for bodies to be burned together.</p>
<p>Also, in a non pandemic year they have an alarming amount of people dying of starvation and malnutrition. No doubt the past year has brought food scarcity up... So it's no wonder that covid is killing more people there.</p>

<p>I think you've missed the point about the pyres. We all know that this is part of Hindu custom. The point is that the country is having to significantly increase it's infrastructure of funeral pyres in order to handle the excess <em>volume</em> of bodies that need to be burned.</p>

        <p>France's current Covid burden is ~380 cases per million. India is ~300. But, we need to remember that India is a developing nation, and the testing infrastructure is very poor there. Some estimates are that daily case numbers could be as high as 10x that which are reported.</p>
<p>Also, France has a best in class healthcare system. India does not.</p>

        <p>There was also a news article that showed pictures of people dying in the "pandemic" but a related photo was shown, with the same people in the same clothes in the same place from a slightly different angle, a year earlier in an article about a gas leak. I saw it here a few days ago. Evidence that the media is intentionally misrepresenting the situation. It doesn't prove that there isn't a problem in India, does prove that at least some of the information is deliberately misleading and/or inaccurate, which makes the rest of it suspicious.</p>

        <p>I have a lot of coworkers who live in India or family in India. The situation is very real there and much much much worse than the media is showing. And it’s not just the poor people. Yes, India has many slums but it’s affecting everyone except the ultra rich.</p>
<p>With that said, they’re saying that it got this bad because people got lax. They had one shot or no shots starting having social gatherings, going about normal day etc etc. I don’t buy that as a reasoning.

<p>no - my point is - a BBC article stating "India builds more crematoriums; is running out of space" - <strong>is obvious</strong>. </p>
<p>The fact that this obvious need is framed in the context of "COVID DISASTER" is disingenuous.</p>
<p>11 million more people. At a death rate of 7.3 per 1000, thats an additional 80,000 bodies that need to be burned.</p>

        <p>I understand. But respectfully, you're missing the scale of what we're talking about. India is vast, and that population increase is tiny. </p>
<p>For context, the area of the Delhi Metropolitan area is about 6x that of New York City. I assume that your national population increase of 11 million is correct. This is a 0.8% population increase nationally. The article I linked to referred to the funeral infrastructure of Delhi alone. With a population of 19 million, let's assume that there has been a 0.8% increase of 152K people in Delhi since the last flu season. At 7.3 deaths per thousand, that's 1109 excess deaths to be expected in Delhi this season. Based on your numbers and spread across a 90-day flu season, that is a mere 12.3 excess seasonal respiratory deaths per day to be expected in Delhi from this population increase. </p>
<p>Do you think that what we're seeing in Delhi and the article I linked to is consistent with a daily excess of 12.3 respiratory deaths caused solely by a 0.8% population increase?</p>

        <p>&rt; a mere 12.3 excess seasonal respiratory deaths per day</p>
<p>no - deaths from all causes. </p>
<p>Pre-covid 2019/2018 crude death rate 7.3 of which respiratory viruses account for 7% of that total.</p>
<p>I think - if we want to go into city specifics - Delhi - we'd need a more focused data set - than applying a national average to the capital city - we may find that death rates and growth rates vary from the national average - its not usual for large cities to grow faster than more distant regions.</p>
<p>A quick google - (I will dig out the Indian ONS data)</p>
<p>"31,181,000 - The current metro area population of Delhi in 2021 is 31,181,000, a 2.94% increase from 2020." (30,291,000" is the 2020 number given on google)</p>
<p>In a population of 31,181,000 based on the historical pre-covid death rate of 7.3 you would anticipate 2,275,000, Two million, two hundred and seventy five deaths from all causes.</p>
<p>Respiratory virus deaths, pre-covid are recorded at 7% of all total deaths. We're looking at 160,000 anticipated deaths. In Delhi Region. This year. From respiratory viruses.</p>
<p>Recorded Covid Deaths in Delhi - total 16,600 since Jan 2021.</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm trying to bring up the death data for the Delhi region, but all the deaths I can find are recorded within Delhi the city.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if we assume - none of the people from the Delhi Region are registered with the Delhi City, 19 million vs 31 million,  that number </p>
<p>Anticipated deaths 100k - no covid</p>
<p>Recorded 16k - with covid</p>

<p>Thanks for replying. But this is incorrect. Your math is off by a factor of 10. 7.3 deaths per 1000 annually is 227,500 deaths total for Delhi. 2 million deaths would be 7% of the population dying annually, which is just not realistic. By your own numbers, it should be 0.73%</p>
<p>If 7% of all deaths are caused by respiratory illness, that's ~15,900 respiratory deaths in Delhi annually. By your own admission, Delhi has surpassed this in terms of Covid deaths (16k) since January. </p>
<p>Based on your own numbers, the number of annual respiratory deaths in Delhi is going to be many times the expected amount. If you recalculate your own data, can you see how serious the situation is? You've even done the math. It's just that your expectations were off by a factor of 10.</p>

        <p>No problem. Does this change your view on the situation in India? You've looked at the numbers and done genuine analysis to illustrate that the rate of respiratory death in Delhi is far outside the norm.</p>

<p>I'm slow. When we have the crude death rates, that would be the time for reflection. In the meantime don't believe the freedom of other people should be dependent upon a different nation's hospital capacity, public health system.</p>
<p>Support India - yes. </p>
<p>Send Aid - yes.</p>
<p>Use India to justify lockdowns or passports - no.</p>

<p>Who is saying this? The premise of this entire thread is:</p>
<p>"Is the situation in India bad?"</p>
<p>You initially said "No."</p>
<p>And your own analysis has shown that the answer is in fact:</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>No one is talking about using the situation in India as a means of informing policy elsewhere.</p>

        <p>Where? I'm not based in the USA. And lockdowns have been highly effective at stemming the tide of the virus in my country. Our case load per capita is more than 95% below the January peak thanks to a 100-day lockdown. Thanks to this and the vaccine rollout, restrictions are easing here now. There isn't much left to protest.</p>

        <p>Are you in India? Half of my teammates work in India. Some of good friends. Their family members are dying...so I’m glad to see you think this is fake.</p>
<p>I’m no doomer and not here to troll but I think some of the people here are too far on the opposite side. Just because you’re not seeing it in person doesn’t mean it’s not happening. </p>
<p>I do agree that the flu was misdiagnosed as covid this year. But this is an <em>extremely</em> vicious strain of the flu. </p>
<p>Also, it has affected the middle classes. Maybe get your head out of your ass.</p>

        <p>Well so most of my family is doing okay. They’re just trying to survive lockdowns. They say that they’re afraid of police bc the cops are too extreme and taking their powers too far. As long as you don’t get sick it’s fine, because my relatives are saying hospitals won’t even take them for anything. It also varies by state. 🤷🏽‍♀️</p>
