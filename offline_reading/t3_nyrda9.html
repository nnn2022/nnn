    <strong>Employers asking for COVEX status in U.S./ proof, what now? | Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) | Laws</strong>
    <p><p>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law that required the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient’s consent or knowledge. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the HIPAA Privacy Rule to implement the requirements of HIPAA. The HIPAA Security Rule protects a subset of information covered by the Privacy Rule. </p>
<p>The Privacy Rule standards address the use and disclosure of individuals’ health information (known as “protected health information”) by entities subject to the Privacy Rule. These individuals and organizations are called “covered entities.” The Privacy Rule also contains standards for individuals’ rights to understand and control how their health information is used. A major goal of the Privacy Rule is to ensure that individuals’ health information is properly protected while allowing the flow of health information needed to provide and promote high quality health care and to protect the public’s health and well-being. The Privacy Rule strikes a balance that permits important uses of information while protecting the privacy of people who seek care and healing. </p>
<p>To comply with the HIPAA Security Rule, all covered entities must do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all electronic protected health information</li>
<li>Detect and safeguard against anticipated threats to the security of the information</li>
<li>Protect against anticipated impermissible uses or disclosures</li>
<li>Certify compliance by their workforce</li>
</ul>

<p>*If employers are not providing health insurance, they are not allowed to know about your health/medical data aka your covex status. u can lie about being covexed and no need to show evidence or proof.*</p></p>
