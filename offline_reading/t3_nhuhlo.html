    <strong>I will never trust anyone again.</strong>
    <p><p>This whole collective dystopian insanity was my worst nightmare. Fascism. Collective stupidity and fear. Denunciation. And it all became true.</p>
<p>I can’t ever trust anyone again. I can’t trust my family and friends anymore, people, knowing that they so gave in to this whole insanity and jumped right on board, as if they had always waited for it. It’s like when the Titanic sinks and you realize the people you’d save wouldn’t do the same for you, because they all look after themselves. People I used to love, wearing masks like criminals, telling me they „got the shot“ (in their head), people ruining the restaurants and bars and businesses they said they loved.</p>
<p>My biggest concern is, how can I in the future know who is one of them? When this will all be over, people, society, all these coward snakes and naive sheep will all act like nothing happened again and then put on that other mask, the invisible one on their character. How will I know that back then during Corona, they were one of them? How can I avoid them when it’s over, and when they will fall back to their true ugly character again once the opportunity appears?</p>
<p>I hate them all so deeply and want revenge so bad.</p></p>

        <p>You won't believe these words today. But eventually you have to walk in forgiveness...</p>
<p>those that don't get eaten up by their own vitral and anger.</p>
<p>While walking and forgiveness you'll notice you become indifferent to other people's opinions.</p>
<p>It's understandable not to trust but when you walk around in hate that is where life begins to be wasted.</p>
<p>The golden rule is hard but when you at least attempt it on a daily basis you'll have peace</p>

        <p>I think you are spot on, though how can one be indifferent to other people's opinions, when their opinions are that things should be forced on you whether you like them or not, even though you can see plain as day that those opinions are formed under falsehoods?</p>
<p>I'm sure I am not alone in having trouble with this dilemma.</p>
<p>Normally, I could give a fuck less about what people think.</p>

        <p>I understand your anger and frustration, I think we all feel it :( one way to look at it is that those who believe all the media lies are as angry as you are, except directed at us instead of corruption.  Now obviously I dont think its justified, but in their minds it is.  Maybe it would help you to remember you dont want to be like them, full of anger and creating divisiveness. Holding a grudge is like eating poison and hoping the other person dies. Just try to keep your circle small, people will show their character in different ways.  Best wishes to you</p>

<p>Keep the circle of people you trust extremely small. I have learned this the hard way, and adopted adopted the philosophy of "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, "<strong><em>DTA: Don't Trust Anybody</em></strong>." I hate to say it like that, but unfortunately, this "pandemic" allowed us to see who you, can not trust, and who will betray you at a drop of dime.</p>

        <p>I know. You are right, I know this is exactly their goal. But I am on that side who realized it. They don’t get that I’m fighting for them and me, for us. They rather listen to the media and the government and denunciate their fellow citizens instead of holding together against them.</p>

        <p>You don't forgive people for them, you forgive them for yourself. Anger and the want of vengeance harm you far more than those who have wronged you. I know how you feel, I have the same anger and disappointment towards my family and friends who bought into the propaganda. I decided that I still love them, but will keep them at a healthy distance and surface level of intimacy, not sharing details of my life or my thoughts with them any longer. They made their choice, I made mine. It is what it is.</p>
