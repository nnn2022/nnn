    <strong>What’s actually going on in Brazil with the variant and the supposed crazy COVID surge?</strong>
    <p><p>I can’t find any article in the English language media that is in favor of President Bolsonaro or that paints a picture of what’s going on without sensationalism or at least some sense of “be afraid”. I’m curious if anyone has alternate perspectives?</p>
<p>From what I gather, Brazil got unlucky with a mutant version of COVID developing in their borders that probably can reinfect some fraction of people who had COVID prior (though I have to imagine many double COVID survivors would have very robust immunity now) while also spreading very efficiently. It seems like there is a serious strain on medical and mortuary infrastructure, but the country isn’t collapsing. We also need to consider the huge population and density of the nation relative to the COVID numbers. We also need to consider how much medical capacity Brazil had in the first place versus the shortages they are experiencing now.</p>
<p>I am not 100% sure what to think of the Brazil example. New stories and pictures from Brazil “being overrun” seem to be very effective tools to play up “fear of new variants”, but there has to be another side to this story?</p></p>

<p>I mean .. if you take headlines seriously almost every country in the world has been on the brink of of a hospital collapse every day for the past year.</p>

        <p>Nothing's happening. It's just that Brazilian government refused to sign a deal with pfizer for as long as they insist on the no-liability clause, and thus they need to be painted as the cradle of the pestilence as a punishment.</p>

        <p>how random, i have been trying to research this today as well. not much to find. maybe it would be a benefit to speak portuguese..?</p>
<p>the only bit of "info" i could find that seemed interesting was a youtube comment along the lines of "brazilian hospitals are intubating too much, due to panic,. unfortunately intubation often ends deadly,. people are fleeing/escaping the intubation - since some of them know/believe this is dangerous"</p>
<p>i also looked up if there is any correlation with vitamin d deficiency per country, but brazil appears to be doing generally fine regarding vitamin d levels. fun fact i found out during this research: the population of the dark and not very sunny country of sweden has fantastic vitamin d levels - due to their general specifically high fish consumption. is that related to their good performance in their pandamic? </p>
<p>naturally, youtube comments are 99% bullcrap. so:</p>
<p>any brazilians here with more insights pls?</p>

        <p>Hello, I'm from there.</p>
<p>What's happening is that we have a public health system that's collapsed since always. Here's a 2015 article on it: <a href="http://g1.globo.com/bom-dia-brasil/noticia/2015/03/falta-de-leitos-em-utis-preocupa-pacientes-em-todo-o-pais.html">Bom Dia Brasil - Falta de leitos em UTIs preocupa pacientes em todo o país (globo.com)</a></p>
<p>That, and a supposed "COVID variant", is being spun into a narrative to attack the federal governent, alongside the "burning Amazon" one from the eurocucks, to paint Brazil as "international threat".</p>
<p>So, politics, as always.</p>

        <p>Perhaps not even similar, the very same. Your media has articles against Bolsonaro coming from our media, and vice-versa. There's a big circlejerk where our papers always source US news from CNN, NYT, WaPo and MSNBC, and news from the UK from The Guardian, and the US and UK source our Globo, Folha and Estadão.</p>
<p>Look at this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/opinion/bolsonaro-office-of-hate-brazil.html">Opinion | Brazil’s Troll Army Moves Into the Streets - The New York Times (nytimes.com)</a></p>
<p>This "Patricia" is a "journalist" known for a fake article accusing the president, at the time candidate, for contracts involving companies and ad agencies and buying spam on WhatsApp, without evidence outside hearsay from "sources". In the end, in one of the funniest twists, one of these sources accused her of offering sex for declarations, in a joint congressional hearing.</p>

        <p>I’d ask someone on the Brazil sub. Yesterday cnn painted a picture that chinas ships were threatening the Philippines. Yes 183 fishing ships went into their waters but every response I got was that it was nothing.</p>
