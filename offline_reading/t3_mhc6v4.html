    <p><p>I never would’ve thought in a million years that voluntarily not wearing a mask would be the pinnacle of personal liberty and self-respect, but here we are. We’ve suffered a major blow to our freedoms that were already on shaky ground, but I am at least pleased others have become aware of this travesty. If rightful distrust of our respective governments persist I could see some very positive changes coming about post-Covid.</p></p>

        <p>Having grown up in California, I have spent most of my life watching as people's personal liberties have been slowly stripped away and they have sat back, either blissfully unaware or making excuses for why it was okay. When I finally left, I hoped it would be better here. I was naive to think that I would be able to escape by moving states. I should have been more practical and realized this was a national and a global movement to control people. 
I really do hope that the swell of people seeing these blatant power grabs for what they are keeps gaining momentum. I'm not 100% sure where we go from here, but this is a huge turning point for humanity, one way or the other. We either accept this or we refuse, as a people.</p>

        <p>It is certainly a massive turning point. As the prevailing narrative becomes less and less convincing, it’s even more obvious who is a traitor to the species or a real red-blooded human being.</p>

        <p>Most people cannot see in front of their own noses. If you look at the onset of totalitarianism in various settings throughout history, it's commonly achieved in small steps. E.g. first the broken windows, then the yellow stars, then the ghettos, then the trains, then the camps and then the showers, and some are still in denial up until the very end.</p>

        <p>The citizens of the United states need to quickly come to the realization that this will end when they want it to. They will stop being taken advantage of when they want to. Their government will stop holding them financially hostage when they want it to. The average US citizen has become complacent in the police state that has unfolded before their eyes. It will end when they want it to. </p>
<p>The questions stand.</p>
<p>Have you had enough ?</p>
<p>Are you not a sovereign being?</p>
<p>Do you want it to end?</p>
