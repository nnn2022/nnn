        <p>Prove it. Prove to me right now that i, an essential worker who has been outside working and shopping and living my life all year, is superspreading a virus that my immune system fought off 10 months ago.  Prove it to me right here and right now and I'll wear a mask.</p>

        <p>I bet you won't but alright. The virus travels through respiratory droplets which are released through exhale. An o2 molecule is much smaller than the respiratory droplets which enables the mask to filter the oxygen and virus. Another point, an experiment using a high speed video camera recorded droplets ranging from 20 to 500 micrometers, all of which were unable to pass through a damp washcloth. The strongest evidence comes from epidemiological information. Mask mandates in 15 states have led to a slowdown in daily covid growth rates. Literally the first 5 days, the rates slowed down by 0.9%. By 2 weeks, it slowed down by 2%. Another study looked at covid deaths amongst around 200 countries. They found that those who enforce wearing a facemask had much lower death rates. I can go on.</p>

        <p>No, the virus is aerosoled.  It's airborne just like the flu.  It's spread just like influenza.  Influenza has been ruled as a virus whose transmission cannot be slowed by a mask.  The 1918 outbreak of influenza killed 650,000 Americans alone and everyone wore a mask.  Since then masks have never once been listed as a means of fighting influenza contagion.   Covid spreads the same way.  It's been publicly stated many times.  The water droplet thing was incorrect and people like you CLING to it because it justifies masks, but it's incorrect.  It's time you accepted that fact.  But that has nothing to do with proving I'm still contagious.  Nothing.  NEXT</p>
<p>And that's all you had?   That's it?   None of that has anything to do with what I asked you to do.  Why are you avoiding the assignment?</p>

        <p>No shit it's airborne that's the same with 99% of viruses. It can still travel through respiratory droplets nonetheless. Also that was a century ago, this is 2020. There's been 256,000 deaths from covid and everyone's wearing a mask. Cool. You've provided 2 things of "evidence" main piece coming from 1918. Also cool. Not gonna accept that "fact" though because wearing a mask is still important. As I said it protects other people, not just yourself. I figured it would be obvious but braindead dumbasses like you wanna make a stance.</p>
<p>Also no, as I said I can go on. You've completely dodged my points about previous experiments aswell. The evidence does in fact have to do with what you asked, you just chose to ignore it.</p>

<p>I'm an essential worker who hasn't once hidden from this virus.

        <p>I only just now realized you were trying to get me to prove that you are contagious. That's my mistake, I apologize. However, I never said within the entire thread, that everyone is a carrier of the virus. There is a possibility that you might not be carrying the virus but you can never be certain. I still believe it's within everyone's responsibility to wear a mask when they go out. It's not just to protect yourself but everyone around you as I keep saying. They're gonna create a vaccine eventually but there's absolutely no valid reason for you to not wear a mask when you go out. It's not a birdon and you'll probably be ridiculed if you don't wear a mask. It's so much easier for everyone if you just suck it up and wear a damn mask.</p>

        <p>protection from what?  I'm not contagious.  I don't have covid.</p>
<p>And it doesn't protect your breathing.  Did you know that there isn't a single human being on this planet that has sterile breath?  Not one.  There's not one article you can go find that proves otherwise.  </p>
<p>Our breath is foul.  Always has been always will be.  This is not to be contested.  It's logical enough.  You breathe- you exhale foulness.  All that shit collects on your mask- you know the one- that THING you rip off your face, shove into your pocket, and then put back on with filthy hands.</p>
<p>Do you know what allows that foulness to flourish?  Warm Moist Environments.  Exactly the kind that you create when you breathe into the same filthy mask you put on day after day after day.  </p>
<p>People have developed respiratory infections because of extended mask use this year.  People have had their face break out in sores and pimples because of extended mask use this year.</p>
<p>So, before you tell me that masks protect your breathing, you should note that I'm pretty educated.  I'm an electronics tech, but before I could be one in a hospital, I had to take multiple medical courses so that I'd know my working environment.  There is nothing sanitary about that mask you're wearing.  It's a breeding ground for some VERY nasty shit.  That's why you have to throw them away and never ever EVER touch it.  You scrub your hands, put on the mask, take it off, throw it away, and scrub up again.</p>
<p>Masks do not protect your breathing.  Final note- I'm not a germophobe, but I do understand how disgusting masks are.</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci wrote a paer on the 1918 outbreak.  His conclusion was that influenza didn't kill 650,000 people.  It weakened them, but they actually died of respiratory infection.  He didn't tie this to the masks they all wore, but it's a safe assumption.  I only bring that up to make my point- masks don't protect your breathing.</p>

        <p>I don't wanna write another paragraph.. I'll keep it short. Some Masks are disposable and others are washable. There's no in between. It's the irresponsibility of people that get them sick. Masks are less than 50 cents per. It doesn't cost much to replace them once per day or to put them in with your laundry.</p>

        <p>That wasn't my point.  I can easily afford masks.  But they aren't sanitary.  If you wear one, you better have a good reason because they get disgusting really quickly.  </p>
<p>I don't have a good reason to wear one.  Making you feel better about your own life is not a good reason.  It's not my job to do things so that you can feel better about your own life.  That's your responsibility.  You don't have the right to influence my behavior so you can feel better.  You have to make your own life better.  That's called being an adult.  No one is going to improve your life except you.  My not wearing a mask has nothing to do with your life.  It's about my life.  I'm not contagious so I do not cause you harm by not wearing one.  And that's the whole story right there.  I don't have to wear a mask if I don't want to.  Well, I don't want to.  If that bothers you, too bad.  You have not earned the right to influence that decision.</p>

        <p>It's not for me, it's for literally everyone around you. You could become a carrier and infect one of your friends or family members and get them sick. It doesn't matter if you're sick or not, you can still spread it through any physical means.</p>

        <p>First, you really haven't scrolled through the subreddit or even the comment section. You haven't noticed that it's filled to the brim with antimask opinions. Second, "attention I crave". In what way am I craving attention? You've given a comeback that only middle schoolers use. A terrible and off-topic one at that. How old are you?</p>
