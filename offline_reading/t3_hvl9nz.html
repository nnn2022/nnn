        <p>To me this principle has to underlie any sincerely argued case against Covid policy bullshit. There is extraordinarily little evidence that government undoes <em>anything</em> once implemented, and for that reason we must be extremely vigilant. Truthfully I also have to remind myself that the reason I'm so <em>scared</em> is because of this principle, even though I often don't consciously think of it that way.</p>
<p>It is also this principle that is making me take a new look at libertarianism and stuff, because there is so much at stake now if the regulatory state continues to believe it has no limits -- the privacy implications of electronic surveillance, etc. One cannot just hope something is going to change or "become sane" on its own, with the path government is on. Governments grab power and distribute money to the connected. I think there was a time in North America when there was "good government", when people with principles were in it, and government built much of the infrastructure at a fair cost that underlies our society. The problem is that since then, government became a system to be extracted from by various parties, and not much more.</p>
