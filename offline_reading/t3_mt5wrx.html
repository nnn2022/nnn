    <strong>Some helpful information, links, and research</strong>
    <p><p>I keep noticing a lot of people needing help convincing others not to wear masks, not to get the vaccine, or that COVID is a hoax; and I find myself handing out the same articles over and over again.</p>
<p>I don’t know how many of you are actually going to see this, but I hope this helps. </p>
<p>Here are the best sources I have found:</p>
<p>Vaccine:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.deconstructingconventional.com/post/18-reason-i-won-t-be-getting-a-covid-vaccine">Coherent, succinct argument not to get the vaccine</a></p>
<p><a href="https://themostbeautifulworld.com/blog/vaccine-studies">List of scientific studies indicating the COVID vaccine can cause cytokine storms on exposure to variants, liver damage, prion disease, etc.</a>. The implications of these studies, when taken as a whole, are that the vaccine is clearly a population control mechanism, via both killing people outright and sterilization, and that it’s a drug in the meanest sense—it causes a “dependency.” This dependency manifests not as an addiction, but in the way the “vaccine” works; if a person has received even one shot, they will continue to need booster shots for every other variant to come into existence, as failure to receive these additional shots will result in a likely fatal cytokine storm on exposure to any one of these variants.</p>
<p>Face masks:</p>
<p><a href="https://stateofthenation.co/?p=31693">Masks can cause brain damage via oxygen deprivation</a></p>
<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">No evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission</a></p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200818072706/https:/www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/new-study-reveals-blueprint-for-getting-out-of-covid-19-lockdown">Mask requirement was of no benefit and could even increase the risk of infection</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">University of Illinois concluded face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/13523664">Japanese researchers found that cloth masks “offer zero protection against coronavirus”</a></p>
<p><a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">A 2015 study in the BMJ Open found cloth masks may increase infection risk. </a> A word of warning using this source—the scientists who conducted this study have tried to eat their words since then, which may give your opponent something to point their finger at.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in a statistically significant way among wearers.</a> I would caution you in using this one, as there were very few participants in the trial (under 100 in each group), and that does make it less credible on a scientific level.</p>
<p>The overarching agenda:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/VT4lY6HWdfA">The “pandemic” is only the catalyst to really begin in earnest the much larger Net Zero agenda of the richest and most powerful people in the world.</a> This agenda is alternately called the “Race to Zero,” where “zero” means “net zero carbon emissions.” This, in turn, is a very thinly veiled excuse to gain absolute control over the masses.</p>
<p><a href="https://thecanadianreport.ca/is-this-leaked-memo-really-trudeaus-covid-plan-for-2021-you-decide/">The world leaders intend to first make it inconvenient/difficult to live without the vaccine as an incentive to get it, then start imprisoning the remnant who still refuse it for the crime of being “health hazards.”</a> This is a Canadian leak, but the end game seems to be common worldwide. <a href="https://computingforever.com/2021/04/14/the-two-tier-prison-society/">A presenter from Ireland also talks about this</a></p>
<p>I hope you find this helpful!</p>

        <p>Great work, but it's not that simple to break through all the years of mind control and the daily brainwashing since more than a year.</p>
<p>It's too much for most people to comprehend the level of evil that is being played right now.</p>

        <p>The good news is the elite don't get to decide what wakes people up. My cousin woke up when one day he left his mask in the car. He was half way through his shopping when he realized that. He became panicked. This is a former E7, three time Iraqi vet who has had all types of shit happening around him and he was able to maintain his cool in those situations, but THIS was freaking him out. He came to his senses pretty quickly but when he left the store he was like, "Dude that is NOT normal..."</p>
<p>Now he's done with this, done with politics and basically concluded, as have I, that all the "isms" are bullshit. No amount of propaganda could withstand his realization. He still woke up.</p>
