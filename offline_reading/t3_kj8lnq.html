        <p>It's because they're cowards honestly. Sugarcoat however you like, that's really it. Or, slightly more charitable explanation, they aren't smart enough to properly appreciate the magnitude of the damage that they, and everyone else is going to suffer for this. I suppose it's not really all that charitable either though.</p>

        <p>Cowards that don't want to lose their paycheck.  But speaking the truth is reward in itself.  A doctor.who wrote against the lockdowns in CA was just fired from the hospital he worked at.  He was punished for speaking out but I bet he doesn't feel bad at all.  I've lost many friends, some family and I'm sure now future job opportunities.  But it's not important.  These liars that are destroying society with fear and bad science need to be confronted.</p>

        <p>In my experience, people that speak out like this tend to land soft. There are a great deal more many people that don't agree with the main-stream narrative, than anybody seems to think. Not only that, but the refusal to go along with all the madness is such a fantastic litmus test for sanity that by speaking out, you will instantly earn the trust of anybody else who is also sane.</p>
<p>I know that for myself, I feel that I can immediately be friends with anybody I meet who is not wearing a mask. There is no question in my mind, just from that. </p>
<p>Because of that, there will always be people willing to look out for the well being of the brave ones.</p>

        <p>I just refuse to participate in lies and emotional manipulation.  And mistrust anyone that is willing to go along with it out of selfishness.  Because that's what it is, they don't want to lose something they have.  A job or their cushy life.  So they ignore society crumbling around them and go with it because they are betting that they will maintain everything that they have.</p>

        <p>They're driven by fear.  That fear may be logical, but it's the fear steering, not the logic.  </p>
<p>Throughout this crisis, I've found myself wondering more than ever how all these people can be part of the same species I am.  This is one of the key differences of the autistic mind; we have emotions, and they're usually extremely strong- and all the more impactful, given the way our memories often work, so that we have a form of "experiential permanence" that allists lack.  But the danger of letting that control you pushes us early in life to operate with more control (to varying degrees of success, natch), and the social backlash drives us further and farther inward.  </p>
<p>Twenty or thirty years from now, you're going to be hearing a hell of a lot of "Wir haben es nicht gewußt".</p>
