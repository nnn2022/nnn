    <strong>I'll tell you what is going to be the new normal</strong>
    <p><p>After the pandemic is over, people will only appreciate each other more then before.</p>
<p>People will appreciate their freedoms more.</p>
<p>There's going to more research done to make sure this doesnt happen again.</p>
<p>The only thing that's going to be the 'new normal' is
conspiracy theories that will call COVID a hoax and memes about it.</p></p>

<p>Somehow I doubt this. People have been treating each other like absolute dogshit for the most part.</p>
<p>&rt; People will appreciate their freedoms more.</p>
<p>I doubt this as well. </p>
<p>&rt; There's going to more research done to make sure this doesnt happen again.</p>
<p>Maybe people in our camp. Not sure about the rest of the populace, they seem fine just following blindly what "experts" recommend.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I was gonna say. I'd love to believe this, but I don't think the division between people has ever been larger. People treat each other like disease vectors, and if you dare not wear a mask, they will happily and unironically wish death on you and your family.</p>

        <p>I actually got a PM from someone here, saying this was the "most evil thing (I've) ever said". </p>
<p>Eh. I don't think so. I find it mind boggling when people, especially on this side, claim that these times are bringing people closer together, that people are becoming more "woke" and aware, etc. It feels almost like gaslighting. It makes no sense with what I am seeing, both online and offline.</p>

        <p>I have to say, I've been surprisingly unconfronted in shops so far. Apart from a couple of instances on the tube nobody has really said anything. Lots of people don't bother in shops. From what I hear I've been lucky though, my nephew has been kicked out of four shops and he gave in and made a mask! </p>
<p>I guess these people prey on the weak. I just swan around lke I did in 2019 and people leave me alone, generally. </p>
<p>People still don't seem to be chilling out on the collective fear mongering though.</p>

        <p>So most I believe are trolls, however a good chunk were teenagers. Weather or not the teens are trolling idk, but I don’t think some were. They really believe they might kill people without a mask and if that’s the case they are being psychologically abused imo. It wasn’t people from this sub though. Sorry I should have said that.</p>

        <p>Someone was called a "doomer" last month for either doubting that schools would have in-person classes or believing school with COVID rules would be worse than no school at all. That's why I try to avoid such words, because "doomer" can go both ways. Or at least I'll specify "COVID doomer" or "rona doomer" to leave less room for misunderstanding.</p>

        <p>A lot of people in this sub (I mean the regulars, not the trolls) consider me evil because my comments are not very optimistic. I tend to be very cynical over the way things are headed right now. I guess I'm not shy about sharing that sentiment on here, especially since I feel like people are a bit <strong>too</strong> blindly optimistic. I've even seen people saying things are getting better and improving. I...don't see that. The fact they are now talking about cancelling MLB and the NFL, for example, is very <strong>BAD</strong> to me. I don't see attitudes changing, the fear is still very much alive.</p>

        <p>This is nuts to me. I get people tiring of constant bad news, but...we are where we are with that. We are all in different parts of the country facing different levels of insanity. I'm optimistic to a degree, but I know there are areas that are absolutely not in the same place. There's room for cynics and optimists. We need each other, actually.

<p>I'll...try, but I'm already getting tired of it. Partly because I'm beginning to feel numb to the hysteria being all around me. Partly because I am tired of having people troll and chastize me, especially <strong>here</strong> of all places (same thing happened at LDS, except there I had trolls claim I was a bigot who harassed minorities and gay people... Ugh...).</p>

        <p>I get it. I'm very tired as well. I assume we are all being threatened all the time, it has gotten so common. It wasn't on here, but I did have some random person say they would find out where I live and call CPS on me for "abusing" my son. It's getting wild. I checked out for a bit to regroup. I wish I could say "I can't believe people would be acting like this within the same cause," but...if the last months have taught me anything, it's that deep down people are terrible and all of them want to be right.</p>

        <p>I know. I try not to. But I've struggled with depression and anxiety for years, and things have been very bad for me in recent months. Having people attack me, especially in a sub meant to rally people who hate the current "New Normal" status quo really stings because we're supposed to be allies...right? </p>
<p>Believe it or not, I do not want this awful future to transpire. I am hoping to be wrong, and for people to throw their masks away, and flip off the tyrannical government, and life to resume. It's just not happening, not on a large enough scale to make a huge difference. Sure, "Joe" might have changed his mind about lockdown, for instance, but for every Joe, there seems to be 100 Sallys who continue demanding more restrictions, cries about the virus, shames people not wearing masks, etc.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I get it. i've come across you a few times here and I don't think I've ever disagreed with you. </p>
<p>I don't want to seem patronising but my personal experience throughout this has been kind of freeing. Yes, I'm extremely worried about where we are headed etc... (Don't want to write too much and that would take forever but it's the same as how you feel) However, I didn't feel particularly great about how the world was before this. </p>
<p>Seeing how seemingly intellingent people will do things that have absolutely no logic to them kind of makes you feel vindicated and self assured in a way, no? I mean I always thought I saw things more clearly than most but you always had that doubt right? Well there's no doubt for me anymore. </p>
<p>I know there's more to be concerned about in the grand scheme of things but what I'm trying to say is I've suffered a lot with the things you listed too, throughout my life but especially in the first few months of this when my housmates and family were going all in with the stupidity. I dare not go back through my comments but I was loosing it back then.</p>
<p>I have this weird feeling that nothing can get to me lately. I went full "mask off" on my social media and got hate PMs from previously close friends who I respected and it doesn't bother me. It's good. Fuck them. I want people around me who aren't cowards and I'm determined to find like minded people to share stuff with even if it has to be on the bloody internet but hopefully it will happen in real life too. For the moment I'm just concentrating on myself and being honest with people. </p>
<p>But yeah that's (some of) my experience and I get it's not that easy but worth sharing. Trust me I hate blind optimism too.</p>

        <p>Sorry I think I was misunderstanding the comment I first replied to, I actually feel more like you, on the cynical side. However I’m more of a pessimist anyways, I want to hold onto hope but I also see that what’s going on sports and many other areas of our society is really bad. I don’t see people coming together I think what’s dividing them can’t be reconciled or it seems that way. People have been treating each other like garbage for many years largely in part to social media imo.</p>

        <p>That's true, but it's certainly not your average ad.</p>
<p>What they're suggesting cannot be limited to the US. It involves global actors with a global agenda.</p>
<p>If it is a plan and seems rushed, there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/RvRkQoOqW5M">reason for that too.</a> They don't have a lot of time left before the hammer drops.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, if this is true and we see mass arrests of a bunch of powerful people, and it becomes obvious what they've done to keep it all hidden, and it will bring global citizens together to strive for a better future like we've never seen before.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. I think that history will be kind to us and not so kind to the doomers. I like to say that we will have a “better normal” after this because people will never again take for granted something as simple as a handshake or a hug.</p>
<p>I know that it can seem bleak when we look at the current narrative being perpetuated, but focusing on the negative won’t help. I personally only choose to focus on news that confirms things are getting better, otherwise I’ll just fall into a pit of despair not unlike the doomers. The list of stores that recently relaxed their mask mandates is the type of news we should be focused on and celebrate.</p>
<p>Yay for positivity! 😊</p>

        <p>I want to have hope because I have been feeling so much anger, anxiety, and despair. I feel like I am trapped in a nightmare and I can't wake up from it. But I do agree with you that for all the people like us, who don't eat up the bullshit narrative, there will be a sense of wanting to live life more fully. Look how many things we took for granted were just taken away overnight. When this is all over, I want to enjoy my life because I've been through this hell where they can just take everything away so quickly on a whim like that, and the idiotic public will just accept it and beg for more. That is truly terrifying and disheartening. Something needs to happen to completely obliterate the false narrative and those that perpetuated need to be held accountable and pay for the immense harm and damage they have caused. The truth needs to come to light so that something like this never happens again.</p>

        <p>For your first two points, I think the people that got past it, or weren't duped, will feel that way. I definitely feel my in person friendships have gotten stronger, knowing that we were keeping sane together while the world had lost it.  </p>
<p>But I see the doomers regressing deeper into a fear-based orientation to the world. Because remember, it's easier to fool someone than to convince them they've been fooled. It's practically become part of people's identity.   </p>
<p>As for your third point, I really wish that were the case, but I don't think it will be. I think for this to not happen again, a lot of the trusted authorities and experts would have to face a lot of criticism and penalties for their involvement in what was basically psychological terrorism, and I just don't see that happening.</p>

        <p>I dunno. I feel like in some parts of the country could be but the massive unemployment will cause more division in the cities.</p>
