    <strong>Most people fail to understand that not everyone thinks as they do.</strong>
    <p><p>Within the past year I have seen a different kind of divide, the unemployed vs the desired to be employed. There are A lot of people who enjoyed being unemployed during lockdowns and advocate for more government handouts on their life and for a socialized society. On the other hand, many went against regulations and kept their doors open for business and did everything they could to remain working simply because they desired to. </p>
<p>Those who complained about capitalist society and having to work 40 hour workweeks maximum claimed they never had time to do what they wished in their days off or after work hours. But did they end up doing all that of which they claimed they would if there was a socialized government where people didn’t have to work? I didn’t see so personally, if so, very few started up their own craft businesses or redecorated their homes at most. Maybe they spent most if not all of the stimulus money instead of saving or investing it. </p>
<p>People have the most difficult time seeing that there are others who do not wish to live that way, and love working, love owning (and keeping) a business, and all of the challenges that brings. This was possibly the hardest year for business people. Their whole lives centered around keeping afloat and they love and will guard their business with their lives. These people would rather work 12-16 hour days than not work at all. </p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with wanting to work. And there’s nothing wrong with wanting to not work for the man, either. But understand that many people love to work or love to be their own businessman or businesswoman. Any new norm of government funded society where people aren’t working or don’t have a say in their own business practices/ whether their doors can be open goes against human nature and the freedoms we fought for.</p></p>
