        <p>WTF? What a Richard move. People are concerned for their health and safety so you cut off their income? I wish all these dictators would be charged and jailed for no doubt mandating deaths and lasting health problems.</p>

        <p>Similarly to <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-punjab-to-block-sim-cards-of-citizens-not-vaccinated-against-covid19-101623379436486.html">another measure to stop the functioning of SIM cards for those not vaccinated,</a> Pakistan is now taking other, even more coercive measures to ensure compliance with vaccine decrees :</p>
<p>&rt;Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Thursday directed the finance ministry to stop the salaries from July of government employees who refuse to get themselves vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>&rt;Presiding over a meeting of the provincial task force on Covid-19, which was attended by provincial ministers, the chief secretary, law enforcers and medical experts, the chief minister said: "Government employees who do not get themselves vaccinated will have their salaries stopped from July."</p>
<p>As I've noted elsewhere, will the Pakistan government take full responsibility for any <a href="https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/06/06/stephanie-seneff-covid-vaccine.aspx">short or long term side effects (of which even various medical professionals are warning)</a> that could arise from the vaccine? I have strong doubts it will. </p>
<p>Should the jab not remain on voluntary basis alone, so that each individual may decide whether the vaccine or the virus is what the lesser evil is in their opinion (provides they catch the virus)? </p>
<p>Are we collectively moving into a dystopian hell of controlled and forced medical procedures, while people are staying silent and going along with it?</p>
<p>You decide. </p>

        <p>As "elected" officials it's amazing how quickly they forget why they are there and who they serve.</p>
<p>People need to come together and just say no to these bullies. Then throw them out and make sure anyone replacing them is accountable by never putting up with their bullshit.</p>
<p>This is what we should be teaching our children.</p>
<p>Authority figures only deserve respect if they earn it. Betray the people are you are no longer allowed to serve.</p>
