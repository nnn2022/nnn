    <strong>I am onboard with disagreeing with lockdowns as it is a breach of our freedom however, I’m not completely sold on governments using it to get “more control”. Let’s discuss.</strong>
    <p><p>Hey guys, just been discussing this topic with my mates and thought it’d be interesting to get everyone’s thoughts on it as well.</p>
<p>We were essentially discussing whether or not this is a government project to control us more. </p>
<p>My disagreement with this is the fact that, governments across the world already have us:</p>
<p>• Working atleast 40 years of our lives</p>
<p>• Abiding laws</p>
<p>• Paying taxes</p>
<p>• CCTV everywhere</p>
<p>• Can track us on our phones/social media activity</p>
<p>And surely lockdowns are too economically damaging if it was a way to get more control over a population?</p>
<p>So my discussion point is, what does “more control” look like and what’s the governments end game here if they already have us doing the list above?</p></p>

        <p>More control consists of implementing a worldwide communist technocracy with social credit and 24x7 tracking and monitoring.</p>
<p>That's why the NWO needs to destroy the world economy first, so the new system can be justified.</p>
<p>But even that is only an interim stage.</p>
<p>The next step is augmenting humans with machines, and capturing / controlling the human consciousness.</p>
<p>That's the end game.</p>

        <p>Governments only care about the economy if it makes them look good and necessary, and it doesn’t cause civil unrest. Right now the focus is on coronavirus. Their corporate sponsors at Amazon and Apple and whatever other big corporations are probably happy with how they are destroying small businesses for them.</p>
<p>The end game is just more control, because politicians benefit and get off on it. Technology allows them to control us more than ever before (camera drones, mass surveillance, social credit system, mind reading ANNs etc), they just need an excuse to roll it all out without causing mass civil unrest. So they use this harmless virus as the excuse</p>

        <p>&rt; Surely a lockdown is too economically damaging</p>
<p>Economic damage does not affect everyone, especially those in power. See: the world’s top billionaires and how they are making bank from this pandemic.</p>
<p>Also, I think you’re sorely lacking knowledge on history here. You know civilizations can’t fall and be replaced without serious damage, right? Especially if communists are running the show. </p>
<p>Look up Yuri Besmenov and start studying about historical takeovers of societies.</p>

        <p>First off, thanks for being so cordial in opening up a discussion about a topic you disagree with.</p>
<p>As to why they would seek more control than they currently possess (indentured slaves that we already are) at the risk of destabilizing the economy? For the same reason a millionaire feels the need to become a billionaire, it's never enough. People have sought to rule the world since the dawn of civilization, it is no different today. The alarming part is that, now the technology and infrastructure exist for the human race to be subjugated on a level never imagined before. This goes beyond even mass surveillance and a police state and into transhumanism. Elon Musk's Nueralink is a prime example of what they have in mind.</p>
<p>The economic fall out is just part of the plan as well. It is a convenient way to bring about a new global, digital currency. This plan is known as the "great reset" and they speak quite openly about it.</p>

        <p>All your points are true, but they neglect one thing.</p>
<p><em>The present tracking mechanisms are decentralized (as in they are operated and owned by different entities, and the systems don't all talk to each other).</em></p>
<p>Your life, on a micro level, is still yours. Government and corporations don't really follow or control your every trip to the store, every tweet you make, every word you say to your co-workers in the lunch room. Or at least they haven't used the resources to do it yet. For the most part, they have relied on snitches and social media mobs to keep citizens in line - self-policing.</p>
<p>The 'Rona gives an opportunity to create social credit and tracking systems on a <em>global</em> scale, because our masters have successfully sold this virus to the normies as a "global problem". The medicine is sugared with "Don't you care about public health, citizen? Don't you want to keep Grandma safe?"</p>
<p>The end game isn't national governments tracking you - it's completely centralized control of your life - a technocracy, likely with the UN as the "front end", but in reality controlled by the most powerful oligarchs on the planet.</p>
<p>People are blind to seeing it, because, like with very very large numbers, the average human can't think or comprehend at that scale.</p>
