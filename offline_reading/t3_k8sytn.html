    <strong>What can WE ACTUALLY do as indivduals?</strong>
    <p><p>I hate this, but I am surrounded by covid happy sheep. What can we actually do? Can we start a petition, a bill or something? I'm not a political major or anything idk how that all works, but it seems like Newsmax, Blaze, and others are covering the stand up by the small businesses. I HOPE they win, but what can we do as individuals to actually make a change?</p></p>

<p>patronize what few small biz are open so long as they don't enforce face diaper dictates, while they are state agent's by way licenses, they are not enforcers and have no 'police powers'</p>
<p>don't protest at parks, protest at the homes of the local tyrants and their enforcers.</p>

        <p>On the individual level - refuse to wear a mask, get tested, get the vaccine, ect. Donâ€™t comply with their dictates. It may seem small but most people go along with this nonsense because they simply go along to get along and social pressure of seeing literally everyone else wearing a mask makes them terrified of being the odd one out. Seeing someone unmasked may give others the courage to take theirs off as well. Ignore the Karens who try to confront you. </p>
<p>If you can, stick to small businesses that are refusing to comply with the orders. Write letters to all the small businesses in your area actively encouraging them to not comply/shut down or reduce occupancy and showing the joke of it all and that weâ€™re in no danger. </p>
<p>Go to as many protests in your area as you can. Preferably ones that are directly confrontative. Protesting can only go so far but if done right, they can send a strong message to these cowardly petty tyrants drunk on their own power. </p>
<p>Print out brochures to put on as many cars as possible. Show how stupid their dictates are, make fun of them as much as possible so people begin to question their legitimacy to destroy peopleâ€™s livelihoods on an arbitrary order.  </p>
<p>Basically, get as many people to stop complying with this as possible and congregate en masse. This is happening because the vast majority of people have allowed their rights to be destroyed.</p>

        <p>start conversations with people. Talk to people when you go to the store and better acquaint them with anti-lockdown viewpoints. Think about it: it's way easier now than it ever was to "cold open" a conversation with a stranger, because you all have this huge, obvious thing in common right in front of you wherever you go. So talk! Lots of people out there already have their own complaints and their own suspicions, believe me. What they <em>don't</em> have is practice exploring their own thinking, or familiarity with the implications of their information. Even the most rabid doomer is still mad as fuck, he just doesn't know why. So tell him! Seriously, everywhere I go I am rallying soldiers. I feel like I was born for this shit. Go out and do exactly what I am doing. It works!</p>
