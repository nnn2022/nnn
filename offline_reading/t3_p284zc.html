    <strong>At a loss. I just received an email from our school board notifying that all students will be required to mask up this school year. Unsure on how to proceed.</strong>
    <p><p>The email:</p>
<p>This message is to update you on the 2021-22 school year.  At the August 10 Fargo Board of Education meeting, Board members approved implementing COVID-19 mitigation strategies recommended by Fargo Cass Public Health for the 2021-22 school year.  These recommendations are due to the changing conditions in our community regarding COVID-19 and the impacts of the COVID-19 Delta variant.  The recommendations include:</p>
<p>Universal masking for all staff, students, and visitors to buildings, regardless of vaccination status or community transmission rates. Masks will be required inside all Fargo Public School buildings for the 2021-22 school year starting on Monday, August 16.</p>
<p>Students and staff staying home when experiencing ill symptoms and getting tested for COVID-19.</p>
<p>COVID-19 post-exposure guidelines of:</p>
<p>Mask to mask exposure: exemption to quarantine</p>
<p>Fully vaccinated contacts: if no symptoms, no quarantine but should monitor for symptoms.</p>
<p>If one or both individuals are unmasked: 14-day quarantine. Contacts may release from quarantine after day 10 if no symptoms or after day 7 with a negative test collected on day 5 or later.</p>
<p>Additionally, masks are required for all riders and drivers on Fargo Public Schools (FPS) transportation, including school buses and activity buses due to a federal requirement. </p>
<p>This decision at our Board meeting will lead to additional information forthcoming from administrators on how these recommendations will be implemented in our schools.  Please watch for information coming from the school district and your childâ€™s school. </p>
<p>FPS continues to be grateful for your understanding, cooperation, and flexibility during these difficult times.  During the Board discussion tonight, it was clearly evident that all of us are here to fulfill our mission of educating and empowering all students to succeed.</p>
<p>FPS will continue to work closely with Fargo Cass Public Health regarding COVID-19.  If recommendations change, FPS will adapt and communicate accordingly.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dr. Rupak Gandhi, Superintendent Fargo Public Schools</p></p>
