    <strong>Face masks dehumanize people, and we're being made to see others as faceless biohazards than fellow human beings.</strong>
    <p><p>I hate going to the grocery store now, or pretty much anywhere out in public. Not to mention I work in retail. I'm not scared of going outside, I just get very unsettled going to a store and seeing everyone wearing masks (and yes I do wear one at the store). But anyway, I feel like I'm staring at faceless mannequins. And as someone who works in retail especially and wears a mask for hours at a time, it's definitely frustrating for me when interacting with some customers and my coworkers. As for one example, I was sitting at a computer today and there was a customer at another checkout line who was very impatient and asked me if a specific department was open.</p>
<p>I was confused at first, because these past two days are the first time in months I've been back to my retail work job after being furloughed. So I didn't really know how to answer him since a lot of policies have changed in my workplace. I was stuttering and trying to get my words out, but of course he couldn't see that with my mask on. He thought I was just staring back at him with a bored expression.</p>
<p>He impatiently put his hands in the air and gave me a look like "well, are you going to answer me or not?". This customer definitely thought I was ignoring him, and it's little things like that which kind of annoy me. I usually have a bad stuttering problem when I get nervous, and it sucks that some customers (and my coworkers) can't even see me trying to get my words out. That's Does anyone else feel the same way? </p>
<p>But even that aside, it's like we're being trained to see people as faceless biohazards instead of fellow human beings. "Infected" people we're not allowed to get close to, and if you do, you're the spawn of Satan who wants to endanger everyone.</p></p>

        <p>It's conditioning, straight out of Brave New World. Children will grow up learning to fear another humans face unless it's through a tv or phone screen.</p>
<p>Besides our brains perhaps, our faces are the most human things about us. Our social contact, the bacteria present in the ecosystems that are our bodies, everything good and human about us is being exterminated.</p>
<p>So much of our inter-human connection comes from the face, and they want to take this away.</p>

        <p>I have consistently told my kids since our idiotic governor implemented a mask mandate that they do not work, they are about control, and if worn too long can cause health problems.  They are only in school 2 days a week, but I told them both to remove their masks as much as they want and if anyone has an issue with it they should direct them to me.  They are told never to wear one outside no matter the reason, and they should not feel pressured to do so just because others are.  </p>
<p>We call them face diapers, and mock people who wear them in their cars.  </p>
<p>I won't allow them to be conditioned and brainwashed by these sick assholes in the governors offices.  This is NOT normal and never will be.  At least in my household.</p>

        <p>It's about control. Things will never go back to normal unless there's a mass awakening and people fight back. Here's what the deal will be: you can stop wearing masks if you get your vaccine passport and have contact tracing 24/7. It's not a little experiment. It's the makings of a 24/7 surveillance state, allowing for more control by the elite over their indentured servants. </p>
<p>This has also weakened the position of the individual and strengthened the power of the government/elite. Small businesses are being crushed. Meanwhile the wealth gap continues to explode. The rich get richer, the middle class (what's left of it) gets poorer and the poor starve.</p>

        <p>It's ramped up considerably. I've been browsing mainstream subs here and, while I think they're flooded with bots and shills that don't represent true opinions held by real people, there are people now referring to anyone who "supports Trump or spews conspiracy theories" as "pathetic, disgusting" and most revealing: "<em>not human</em>."

        <p>Yup. Once people feel comfortable literally dehumanizing the opposing "side" (much easier to do when they have NO FACE btw) it means they have less objection to killing them or allowing them to be killed without empathy. I wish more people realized the precipice on which we stand and not allow themselves to be caught up in tipping the scales any further.</p>

        <p>That's cute. I can see your thinly veiled attempt at being intentionally obtuse before launching into how you're a proud, 4th generation Marine or some shit and this is all lies. If you'd like to know what some of the methods are, check out your nightly news. The propaganda aimed at "anti-maskers" is strikingly similar to the methods outlined.</p>

        <p>Your reply seems quite trivializing but sure, I'll play along. Things like viewing every citizen of the occupied country as  simply "animals and murderers." The idea that you, as a member of U.S. forces are the arbiter of security and justice and that if citizens don't see you as their savior, they're no better than terrorists. I've heard stories of U.S. troops taking turns raping young girls in front of villagers while the others stood guard. You don't just "adapt" to these behaviors, they're slowly and systematically programmed into you until it's not a matter of right or wrong, it's just kinda "what you do."</p>

        <p>It's a mass psychological experiment we shouldn't be making. I've heard mask advocates compare it to keeping a distance from other cars on the road - treating other humans as essentially dangerous.</p>
<p>The effect will be a fearful and socially inept society that will need a big reversal in terms of a counterculture opposing it. This is as big as in Muslim countries that used to be fairly liberal before extremist groups like the Taliban took over and forced women to cover up.</p>

        <p>Yes, it really is a death cult, isn't it?</p>
<p>You can always tell because if you give them any good news about Covid going away -- they will attack you.</p>
<p>If you post facts that question the official narrative -- with sources -- they will report you.</p>
<p>These people are addicted to the adrenaline rush of fear and hate.</p>
<p>They make demands of you, take from you, and call you selfish if you don't comply.</p>
<p>They get a sense of power from bullying others and belittling their "freedomz" and "mild inconvenience."</p>
<p>When you really think about it --- cultists are <em>mild</em> compared to these people.</p>

        <p>It's wonderful that we can spread it so quickly and build large scale immunity. The faster that happens, the faster this is just another cold to the vast majority of the population. Many of the positive cases <em>are</em> those that have already fought coronaviruses and therefore their body can fight this particular one a bit easier than otherwise.</p>
<p>Are people dying ? Yes. People die everyday of lots of things. People die of the flu every year. Some people die from a <em>cold</em> because they're so immunocompromised. </p>
<p>The solution is not to make <em>more</em> people have weak immune system but to allow those of us with the natural ability to fight it off because it ISN'T an insanely deadly virus.. and if/when a safe vaccine comes out those that can't safely fight off the live virus can still gain immunity through that course - those that can't handle any of it will be better protected through all of us that have natural immunity or vaccine immunity.</p>
<p>Weakening the immune system is going to make everything more deadly, not less.</p>

        <p>Sadly it doesn’t appear that herd immunity is possible.  There have been documented reinfections, and the antibodies don’t stick around very long.  It’s a nice idea, but never going to happen, though I truly wish it were.</p>
<p>Many people live long lives with compromised immune systems, and other causes of death are irrelevant to this discussion.  </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that we can’t fully resume normal activities until this thing goes away for the most part.  You can’t force it, and neither can the most ardent government deniers.  The economy is a huge, complex beast, and you can’t trick it to resuming normalcy.  The only solution is reducing the number of cases by <em>a lot</em>.  </p>
<p>I don’t love this one bit, this whole thing is awful, I just want to make it to the other side ok, and I wish the same for family and friends.</p>

        <p>You see, there's like one reinfection for every what? Like 100k cases and even then basically only if the persons immune system has already been compromised do they get reinfected. That's rare, very rare and completely irrelevant. Herd Immunity needs at most 70% infected, most likely less, so people who are at risk can isolate or take measures. </p>
<p>The fatality rate clearly shows that we can let people live completely normally and focus the protection on those who actually are at risk. No need to destroy peoples lives across the globe. </p>
<p>In fact more people will die (and suffer) because of the measures. Like in the tens of millions. And billions will suffer.</p>

        <p>The problem with <em>only</em> protecting those at risk is that it can spread so, so quickly.  Many vulnerable people live with family that work in the general public, or they have to work with people themselves, and when the case rates get high enough, we can’t both go about our normal lives, and also protect those people.  Even if people live through the virus, which is increasingly more likely due to better treatments, overloaded hospitals means those that would have lived normally will not if they can’t be seen, and many will have long term issues from the virus.</p>
<p>Even without government restrictions, things simply won’t return to normal until cases fall dramatically.  There are too many parts of our economy that rely on people being near each other in some way or another, and you just can’t fudge that.  </p>
<p>I would love for herd immunity to have a real shot at happening, but the evidence really isn’t pointing that way.  Wishful thinking is not the key to getting us through this, and in fact it doesn’t really help anyone at all.</p>

        <p>Scrap that long term effect stuff. If you have a strong cold you'll have fatigue and other symptoms last from weeks to months, it's the same with the flu and the same with corona. Barely anyone will take actual long term damage in the sense of years. Apart from that the measures taken by the governments around the world severely worsen the health of the whole population and artificially create a situation where not only more people have a weakened immune system but also herd immunity isn't possible due to preventing proper spread amongst the population.</p>
<p>This disease has a 99.98 survival rate up to age 29, 99.8% up to age 50, 99.5% up to age 69 and something like 95% at 70+. (These numbers are from CDC , I might be slightly off as I am pulling them from my memories)</p>
<p>Clearly there is NOT that many vulnerable people in the first place. The mortality is comparable to a flu, perhaps a slightly stronger one. You and noone else ever cared about the flu. These vulnerable people are at risk from the flu and other respiratory diseases for that matter in the same way as they are from corona. </p>
<p>Average death age of those who died with corona is above the average life expectancy in most countries. Ironically nursing homes register the most corona deaths in many countries. Imagine if you focused on protecting them...</p>
<p>Wishful thinking is that we will have a SAFE vaccine or that we can suppress a virus by destroying the world economy and making everyone become depressed and unhealthy.
Wishful thinking is also that we can live forever or that we can live longer by avoiding to live. </p>
<p>What do you think happens if we go on with lockdowns etc.?</p>
<p>Just a couple of things that will DEFINITELY happen:
Tens of millions more will starve to death.
Tens of millions up to hundreds of millions will lose their job.
Millions of companies will go bankrupt. Most of them being small and medium sized businesses or large businesses which were close to bankruptcy before the corona mess started.
The ones who will be left are huge corporations who will buy everything and make us extremely dependent.</p>
<p>Dying from a disease is natural, dying at a high age is natural. If the mortality looked more like Sars CoV 1 these measures would be justified but we are looking at a flu like mortality rate and the price we pay is far bigger than what the result is worth. </p>
<p>Take a look at r/LockdownSceptiscism for as there are a lot of posts about second order effects of lockdowns and more and maybe then you'll get a better grasp at how much harm these measures are doing compared to the actual virus.</p>

<p>Which is completely wrong. Most people don't notice Corona at all. The people that a strongly affected by Corona are typically the same people that are strongly affected by the flu, it's just that media doesn't report on that 24/7.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands at most. That's nothing... do you know how many suffer in regards to their health because of the measures? Hundreds of millions. Among them many people who didn't get treatment for something other than Corona or were afraid to get treatment because of the fearmongering, people who will have lifelong damage because of that.  You're completely ignoring all of that.</p>
<p>You also have zero evidence backing up that many people will suffer long term damage, even less, that the number of those who will suffer long term damage is high enough to justify the ruining of the world economy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Ok you clearly just made that up.</p>
<p>No, those are the facts. The amount of people who can be considered vulnerable and to whom Corona actually poses a real threat is quite low.</p>
<p>Give me any number that suggests that there is a big danger to the general population. You wont find one.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;We've seen very clearly that COVID is not like other respiratory diseases.  It affects the <a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/covid-19-attacks-the-cardiovascular-system">vascular system</a> in a much more significant way than the flu.</p>
<p>What you linked right here says absolutely nothing of value. All of the mentioned complications exist for other respiratory diseases as well. There's no numbers in the linked article that suggest that it is worse than the flu or other.</p>
<p>Apart from that if you make people stay at home they will have less movement/exercise and thereby be more prone to Corona in the first place. The only thing lockdowns have magnificiently achieved is to worsen the overall health both physically and mentally. And that's something that will affect us for the next dozens of years.</p>
<p>&rt;DEFINITELY will happen?  Please share  your evidence.  How many starved to death in the first "lockdown?"  I  agree that lockdowns have many issues, which is why financial support  for people is <em>critical.</em>  Not that the US ever had a real lockdown in the first place.<br>

<p>How do you think will they not starve if we go on like this. You're truly stupendously ignorant.</p>
<p>And financial support is NO SOLUTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE. Debts are no solution, they will only make the economy crash even harder.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know what world you live in, but in the reality that I see we are essentially ruining the lives of billions for many years to come and sacrificing peoples health and wealth just to presumably prevent a couple hundred thousand (probably less) deaths (of mostly those who would die within a few months or years anyway) across the globe.</p>

        <p>&rt; Sadly it doesn’t appear that herd immunity is possible.  </p>

        <p>Feel free to present evidence to the contrary, I would be happy to see it.  Seriously, I would like herd immunity to be a realistic potential reality.</p>
<p>For starters experts say we need 70%+ of populations to be infected, which we are not anywhere close to.  Secondly, there isn’t clear evidence that the antibodies stick around long enough to give anyone long term immunity, which may also be an issue for the efficacy of vaccines long term.</p>
<p>I didn’t say anything with certainty, in fact I deliberately avoided doing so, but your snark doesn’t count as evidence to back up your claim either.  You want to believe herd immunity is possible, but it’s just an idea that is not supported by the currently prevailing evidence.</p>

        <p>The prevailing notion in science is that it’s not possible without a vaccine.  The notion that herd immunity through natural infection is possible was an idea from early in the pandemic, but since then, there has not been any real evidence that it could realistically happen.  This is a very common notion, and many scientists have echoed this.  </p>

        <p>It literally says in your link that they don't know if people can get reinfected and at what relative rate. Basically they don't know if it's possible</p>
<p>So before you start saying "it's not going to be possible to get her immunity" you should say "they don't know"</p>

        <p>There are numerous issues raised with masks.</p>
<ul>
<li>If masks are effective why is there is no clear evidence they protect us from a deadly virus. Before masks were made compulsory, some wore masks and others didn't.  Why have non mask wearers not been dropping like flies whilst mask wearers survive?</li>
<li>If there was clear evidence masks are a silver bullet which protects us from a deadly virus, why do governments have to make them compulsory by law, fine people for not wearing them and in some countries the police have beaten people for not wearing a masks.  Why is necessary to rely on coercion to get people to wear masks if there is slam dunk evidence they protect people or prevent people infecting others? </li>
<li>If mask wearers are breathing a dangerous and highly contagious virus into their masks, why are masks not treated as bio hazards?  Why are there not instructions on what type of mask to use, disposable masks should only be used once, reusable masks must be washed after use.  Why are there no special bins to dispose of masks?  </li>
<li>Why are masks not being tested to see if there is coronavirus on the masks?  Wouldn't this be a priority in a real pandemic? </li>
</ul>
<p>Masks are a psychological tool.   There is no evidence of pandemic around us.  There are no dead bodies piling up in the street, large numbers becoming severely ill, medical services being overwhelmed and nobody knows with covid.  Compulsory masks and everyone wearing them tricks us into thinking there is a deadly pandemic around.</p>

Countries that are resisting locking down and exercised herd immunity are now being punished , first Denmark with the mink situation , cutting off flights and imports , and any other country who believes they should stay open an persevere. This is the new world order , do not consent to the vaccine, don’t even agree to a test because you will be on your governments radar if you accept .</p>

        <p>I still refuse to wear one in my local supermarkets (London UK). The science certainly isn't "settled" on face mask wearing, but if I felt even slightly ill I would wear one.</p>
<p>I'd say there's only 1 or two others out of 30 who don't wear one either - I get a few dirty looks during my shop but most of them look at you with a puzzled stare, as if I'm somehow defying nature by not keeling over with sickness or shitting myself in fear. The cashiers are all still lovely and friendly (they probably just miss a smile once in their day)</p>

        <p>I used to have a cashier that was always really friendly and I would go to his line intentionally but by now he barely talks, isn't paying attention to customers, etc.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it is his being angry I don't wear a mask or he just doesn't see the point because no one can understand each other through the masks anyway but it really bummed me out today when I saw him and realized he doesn't ask about my week or anything anymore. I made sure to give an extra friendly "have a good day !" As I walked away this time.</p>
<p>So writing this out I realized I'm a freak because a random cashier not kissing my ass is sad 😂😂</p>

        <p>A lot of people are depressed right now so I wouldn't take it too personal...Resentment is a natural emotion people should be feeling right now and unfortunately a lot of people are redirecting it at their fellow humans. I go shopping maskless in the evening and basically always see the same nice cashier I've known for years. He has continued to be polite and helpful and not once has mentioned masks. There is still some hope! Keep going maskless, radiate love and don't care what they think either way.</p>

        <p>Yes, this is intentional.</p>
<p>The masks serve many purposes, but the biggest one is -- it is "scapegoat propaganda." By blaming people who don't want to wear masks for why we have lockdowns, our oppressors completely dodge the blame.</p>
<p>This is a standard tool to shift blame onto a minority group. People who fear authorities will of course blame the minority of people who wear masks. This minority group becomes an outlet for their frustration, and they take the blame for a lockdown they didn't cause.</p>
<p>If these people were logical, they'd see some of the highest spread Covid areas have incredibly high mask compliance. But these people <em>aren't</em> logical.</p>
<p>As much as they love to use the 'science' word, it's just an accusation they don't understand. They don't think deeply. They spend most of their time indoors, on some kind of screen. Their sense of reality is determined by what they consume, not what they see or personally experience.</p>
<p>What they consume is, largely, emotional propaganda pieces, messages of division and hate, and threats.</p>
<p>We are reminded of every so-called Covid death.</p>
<p>We are threatened every time we turn on TV or open any social media.  I can't open my iPad or Android without seeing threats of more people dying, comparisons of this situation to the plague, etc. </p>
<p>And with every threat comes the scapegoat propaganda. It's the people who don't wear masks. It's Trump. It's the Republicans.</p>
<p>So they build up frustration, fear, anxiety, and anger -- and then give them someone to blame for it.</p>
<p>It is the most potent distraction of our lives.  What Covid really about?</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>PS. Just for fun, search "What is covid really about"  (with quotes) into Google. Why is that search censored? (Or am I really the only one who has ever thought to search for that?)</p>
<p>For comparison, "what is happiness really about" has over 129,000 exact search results.</p>

        <p>If we’re lucky this trend might die out by early next year im not a doomer I’m far from it and frankly I do see it happening pandemics usually last about a year though this is barely considered one but still I guess it counts so my guess is by spring a lot of these mindless trends could die out despite the stupid goalposts and stuff being moved at that point people will just have simply moved on and no one will be paying attention restrictions will be pretty much relaxed in a lot of areas</p>

        <p>I have so so many issues with masks, but your last paragraph sums up my biggest problem with them on a societal and psychological level. (Mind you, I am a psychologist, working with adolescents, and am downright terrified to see what sort of issues my patient base will be dealing with a couple of years from now)</p>
<p>It’s not healthy to dehumanise other people. All of these BS “studies” people have made viral on social media claiming that the maskless are the sociopathic ones have it backward. Demanding people hide their faces, view themselves and others as dangerous plague rats to be feared and avoided, is probably the most sociopathic thing I can imagine. Humans are social, interactive creatures. Our faces are a huge part of our communication and seeing others’ faces is an integral part of understanding and relating to other people as PEOPLE. </p>
<p>I find it depressing and upsetting myself, going places and seeing nothing but dead eyes and masks, and observing what masking has done to people’s normal, everyday interaction - killed it. People can’t smile at each other anymore, they don’t strike up conversations anymore...they’re afraid to even look at each other. This isn’t how it’s supposed to be. It’s not how WE are supposed to be.</p>

        <p>I used to love going out in public, but it’s just not fun anymore. I go for a walk almost every day around my town and seeing people walking, jogging, and biking alone with a mask on like it’s sown to their face has made me lose faith in humanity. It’s like rationality has been completely lost and people just obey ridiculous orders from the government like sheep. I used to love going to coffee shops and bookstores but now many employees of these establishments just treat me like I am a danger to them just by patronizing their business just because I just might be carrying the ‘rona since people are nothing more than disease carriers now. I just end up getting frustrated with people and wanting to get back home as soon as I can. I can’t believe we are eight months into this with no end in sight. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, I do live in a dark blue city in a dark blue state, so people are scared to death of Covid where I am and about 90-95% of people are masked up even outdoors.</p>

        <p>Don't you think that this is a big part of the conspiracy at hand? They are making things that humans have been doing for thousands of years (shopping at markets, congregating out in public) incredibly difficult and sucking all the joy and soul out of the experience...They want us to be tied to screens and not out experiencing real life the way it is meant to be fulfilled. I go on regular nature walks and constantly see people out in nature, by themselves, wearing masks. It really detracts from the experience, which used to be a sanctuary and escape.</p>

        <p>You are right. The demoralizing experience of going out and seeing all the masked faces and the ridiculous security theater measures businesses are taking are not an accident. They have done their job of dehumanizing and dividing us as we now view fellow human beings as nothing but disease vectors. It’s hardly about the virus anymore, it’s about control. We have to fight back. </p>
<p>BTW, seeing people on a mountain trail wearing masks has made me start to hate hiking, which used to be one of my favorite leisure activities. People are just driving me crazy with their irrationality. I wish I didn’t care, but I do. This is not a society I want to live in.</p>

        <p>I refuse to wear a mask. Thankfully I live in an area that feels mostly the same. About 50% of the people I encounter in the grocery store also refuse to comply with the mask thing. Our local law enforcement has issued statements saying they refuse to enforce any sort of mask mandate. </p>
<p>The thing that hurts me the most is my not quite 2 year old. He’s a very social little person. I’ve had to stop taking him to the gym with me because they require the childcare workers to wear masks and he gets scared if he can’t see faces. He has zero problems going to the nursery workers at church because they don’t wear masks. </p>
<p>For the past 10 days the little fella and I have been self isolating because we have bronchitis. As a genuinely nice person I removed he and I from public when our noses started to become runny. At this point I refuse to seek medical attention because I don’t need a COViD test, and neither does he. I also don’t need to sit around a doctor’s office wearing a mask. </p>
<p>I’m just thankful that we send our daughter to a private school that doesn’t believe in masks. It is so nice to see all the kids and teachers interacting to their fullest.</p>

        <p>The reality is that we all are bags of biohazards to each other. Of course we won’t die upon contact but it’s not false</p>
<p>I don’t see masked people as inhuman, so maybe seeing smiles are important for you</p>
<p>If someone can’t hear you speak, then you most likely have to work on speaking properly/loud enough through a mask. Kinda bizarre if being unable to communicate through a mask makes everyone see more inhuman though</p>
<p>You do have a higher transmission risk with a mask though</p>

<p>Your right. We shouldn't do that. Those are not essential services. Combined with how little actual essential service workers get paid is even worse</p>
