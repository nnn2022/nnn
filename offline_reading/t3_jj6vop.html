    <strong>I feel we're in a losing battle and it frightens me what kind of future we're leaving our youth.</strong>
    <p><p>My explanation for this is simple. Since the very start, I’ve done my research and thought this was overblown. My mother a Dr, her colleagues, her lab and its associates all agreed. I’d speak with people, myself hinting for their perspectives, as the lockdowns continued for months just to get an insight into other perspectives. I never wore a mask and kept my distance from those who felt it helped or were just playing along to keep others happy. At the start, many weren’t sure about things, and that was understandable at the very least. Rather be safe than sorry I guess.</p>
<p>However, as months passed and I returned to retail work, I’d been excited. I got out more and spoke with more people, and so many agreed that we needed to reopen and herd immunity was the only real way out. At the very least, most people agreed masks were mostly a way to virtue signal that they were doing something right. </p>
<p>Now with time having passed, I see more and more people, nearly everyone around my work and the mall wearing a mask, from before they even park their car to god knows how long after they’ve pulled out of the parking lot. Just last night, I left work after having had to wear a mask for virtually my entire shift. Seeing as the maskless work from home members of the company have now forced this on us (even while there are no customers in the store, which is about 99% of the time seeing as I work in menswear during a time work from home is seemingly normal). </p>
<p>Before I’m even out of those hidden delivery doors of the mall, my mask is deep in my pocket. But as I’m walking to my car, every single person walking either way down the sidewalk is wearing a mask outdoors. Then I see a mother walking towards me with her child about to enter a Halloween store. As they approach, she grabs her son, who was skipping playfully along by the shoulders and pulls him away from me. She then held him close, turning to watch and glare at me as I continued on my way, before muttering something about safety to her son.</p>
<p>What has this world come to that a child can’t have fun going to pick out their Halloween costume. The one fun thing he may get to do this crazy year, and likely one of the first few Halloweens he’ll remember fondly for a long time. He probably won’t even get to wear it out with friends or out trick or treating this year, which makes this even more impactful. It seems he should instead fear anyone who walks by without a useless piece of fabric on their face and waste his innocent youth on hiding away, waiting to be saved by a “miracle” vaccine, which he doesn’t even need.</p>
<p>P.S. To be clear, I believe in vaccines, just not rushed vaccines for a virus his immune system would have no problem dealing with swiftly and effectively.</p></p>

        <p>It scares me too. On my college campus, masks aren't required outdoors, but the way the rules are written, it seems like they are. I see people walking by themselves, 100 feet away from everyone else, wearing a mask. I've talked to people I know and work with, and many people agree the mask is stupid. However, the issue is what you can do about it. Two examples:</p>
<p>My College - You can't enter a building without a mask. People can't eat at the cafeteria without a mask because they get turned away by workers. They can't enter the library without a mask because they get turned away by workers. You can't use the computer lab without a mask because you get turned away.</p>
<p>My National Guard unit - Virtually no one cares. There's no social distancing, normal cleaning, and only like two soldiers wear masks. It's been a COVID supply distribution center since March, and there hasn't been a single outbreak, just isolated cases (I think less than 10). Even the one soldier who got it and has breathing issues agrees the COVID restrictions are bullshit. You can go places without a mask because no one at the armory cares.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the maskpushers control a lot of society, so most of it is like my school, not my Guard unit. There honestly isn't much we can do as long as the mask proponents control the important parts of society, because they can simply tell us "You can't come to my store. No food without a mask." or "You can't come to this hospital. No healthcare without a mask." Thousands of people can protest the masks, but if they have to comply to eat, then how can we fight it?</p>

        <p>That’s the thing, national guard members (in your situation), gun owners and shops here in Canada, reserve/RCAF members I know, and basically anyone else with the ability and desire to think for themselves, as well as a real sense of danger seem to be on our side. It’s just the teachers pet types, who wish to deem themselves as better and enjoy the sense of power they get through criticizing and telling others what to do, who are the bad actors here. Then you’ve got those who simply want to live and/or don’t care to look too hard into it, who just play along.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, those are the ones calling the shots at the moment. Like I said, we can protest all we want, but if we have to comply to survive, what can we do? I'm genuinely asking, not being a doomer. I really want to end this.</p>

        <p>That’s the thing, all I do is try my best to have logical conversations with others, while attempting to skirt the rules as much as possible. I mean I can’t just outright refuse to follow the rules, lest I risk losing my job and being unable to afford my school and other expenses. As well as simply coming across as a straight up asshole to many. It’s not like my only reason behind not wanting to wear a mask, is “fuck you I do what I want and these are my rights!”. Which many would believe if I just went ahead like that, instead I read cues from people and adjust accordingly, or start a conversation and steer It towards what others have to think and go from there.</p>

        <p>People are starting to wake up to the reality of this plandemic, at least some. There are protests happening in multiple countries, and hopefully more soon. As vocal as doomers are, I don't believe them to be a majority.</p>

        <p>It baffles me when I see people wearing them outside. I mean, even assuming that they're actually effective, you're not going to catch a virus walking down the road, that's not how air works.</p>
<p>Even stranger when you see 3 or 4 people in a car all wearing them. Yous are sitting in a metal box 3 feet away from each other, a mask isn't doing anything sorry.</p>

        <p>I wear my mask when I leave the house even while in the car just so I don’t forget it when I go into the store. Honestly at this point leaving the house without a mask is like leaving the house without shoes: businesses don’t want you to enter, and even though most of the time it doesn’t make a difference, the one time you step on broken glass you’ll wish you had worn shoes.</p>

        <p>I don’t think they’re being a doomer. More like saying which way the wind is blowing. You can resist all you want, and should, but you have to keep perspective about how much influence you actually have and what most other people believe.</p>

        <p>We just keep trying to provide as healthy a life for them as we can, even if we are in the minority and even if we have to go underground. We have been very blessed these past couple generations to live in increasing freedom and prosperity, but there was never any certainty it would be that way forever. Obviously I will continue to fight to preserve those things for my children. But if it doesn't work, my responsibility is the same; to do the best I can for them under whatever circumstances we find ourselves in.</p>

        <p>We’ve gotta speak our minds to those who truly matter, the public, those who in all reality control the government at the end of the day. As long as we speak with more and more of those around us, and more join forces against the narrative, the more politicians will have to give in, in order to stay in power. Once that’s complete, we can push those nefarious politicians who attempted to destroy our way of living out, and replace them with those most logical, most caring of the general public, and who reject the liars who pretend to care with their phoney attempts to convince us they’re here for us</p>

        <p>Sure, that’s true to an extent, but the more you speak your mind, and talk to those who question the political elites and news even a little bit, while you try your best to see things from both sides and quote fact over fiction. The more of a chance you have at swaying them to open their eyes and see for themselves, to stop going along with the narrative and think for themselves for once. It should never hurt to question authority and speak your mind to those around you. If it does, it means we’ve lost our freedom of speech, and once that’s gone, so is our freedom by and large. So fight in whatever way possible, a friendly debate with friends, conversation with a neighbour, anything is better than nothing as long as you’re smart and logical about it.</p>

        <p>I'm the same way, I just want people to get their vaccine and be happy, and go back to normal. probably Just as much as they want to, even though I don't think most of us need one, and I don't want one for myself. I just hope it's safe for everyone.</p>

        <p>That’s exactly the reason I thought. It would be great if It could just arrive and not be mandatory, resulting in things returning to normal. But I guess we’ll see eventually.

Most people can't help being sheep, most humans are born with built in submission tendencies except for the psychopathic types who end up being our leaders.

        <p>I can't say anything official because I'm not a Dr (neither is OP for that matter) but heard immunity seems way too risky to implement because of the people who cannot afford to get sick (financially and/or physically).</p>
<p>You mention you're from Toronto, so you'd know how impoverished some community housings are downtown and how little support of any kind they have to face that kinda thing. Plus health care workers are pretty tied up as it is, to handle something like that seems like a pretty decent risk to them.</p>

        <p>I am a Croatian high schooler and i would like to share my opinion here. Ever since the schools reopened and the first wave quieted down, things have taken a turn for the worse with the amount of infected tripling in the last half month alone. Major schools are dropping like flies and their students, forced to go back to the inefficient, stressful conditions of online schooling. I go to art school, and to their credit, they are doing everything they can. Mandatory masks, online - in person week by week switches, measuring temperatures, etc.. Sadly, even we have gotten our first case. A young freshman in 1.B. He and his entire class, along with all the staff who worked with them in the last two days have been quarantined. This is devastating news for a small school like us. Not only did we effectively lose an eighth of our students plus staff, but we have also let the virus enter our school. Now that it is in the school, i know that it's only a matter of time until the dumbass who actively refuses to wear a mask because "he cant breathe in them" infects me or someone close to me and because I'm stuck in a small room with 7 other people, almost all as lax about the issue as him, that might be sooner that i care to think. You might not like it and i dont blame you. You might not even care if you get infected, but even if you dont, you have a duty towards those that do. Their health and the health of those around them cannot be ignored for your comfort.</p>

        <p>That was before a pandemic engulfed the world. Statistically yes, if I and everyone else wore masks on the daily regardless of there being a pandemic or not, less people would die from infectious diseases every year, however that was before i had a lclear incentive to, so no.</p>

        <p>You see, the difference is that you can get vaccinated against the flu. I just got my flu shot a few days ago actually. You can't do that with COVID. And when there are 140,000 more people dying from COVID in the U.S alone, then is it really that hard to wear a mask?</p>

        <p>So those deaths are acceptable to you then, glad we covered that up. </p>

<p>Yes the magical mask that fixes everything. </p>

        <p>I'm not saying those deaths are acceptable, just preventable (with the flu-shot and everything) If people don't want to get vaccinated, then they dom't have to, but they can't expect people to accomodate their idiocy. However, vaccines aren't an option during COVID! </p>
<p>I think I'll actually continue wearing a mask even after COVID is over. Do you know why? Because it isn't hard to wear one! I've been wearing them for 8 hours at a time, and I'm completely fine! It isn't hard!</p>
