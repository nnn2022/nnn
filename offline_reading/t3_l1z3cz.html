    <strong>This whole situation is illogical</strong>
    <p><p>This was a very long first draft and I just went on and on ranting.</p>
<p>TLDR</p>
<p>Since now they use the GIGA MEGA HYPER BRITISH mutation as an excuse to ruin our lives even more I have few questions.</p>
<p>First, how the fuck did they calculate it is somehow more infectious? HOW? I am sure they did not do any form of trials, but pulled some numbers out of their arse.</p>
<p>Second, what exactly is the problem in a new strain. We are talking about places having around 30 to 60% herd immunity, so there is no way the THIRD WAVE can be any bigger then the overhyped SECOND WAVE.They managed fine, despite all the crying the lazy ass medics did. Can`t they just do their job for once.</p>
<p>When will I be able to take responsobillity for my actions?  I am not afraid for me. I am not afraid for my family, if someone else around me is afraid out of covid, he/she will be masked and socially distanced, which according to their logic this is enough to stay safe. So where exactly is the problem in me having a life. </p>
<p>Also,</p>
<p>Where is the document to sign that in exchange of being free I will not receive any medical help for corona. I will take my chances considering I already had it and did not even ring my doctor.</p>
<p>I am tired,  I am annoyed, I am depressed, I am angry.</p>
<p>Just leave me alone, stop lying to me, stop twisting my arms, stop trying to make me feel guilt.Just leave me to enjoy the few good moments in my short and miserable life. Yesterday I was a kid, today I am a young man, tomorrow I will be an adult, next weekend I will be in the grave.  Maybe even sooner, I can get hit by a car, I can drown, I can be electrocuted, I can get cancer or get one of many more untimely demises.Let me enjoy the moment while I still can, this is all I ask. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is also long, but there is so much hatred in me, words will never be enough.</p></p>

        <p>The whole thing is a lie from start to finish. The reason it doesn't make sense is because it's all bullshit. It will never end until people start waking up to this fact.</p>

        <p>I think you pretty much summed it up.  </p>
<p>My frustration comes from my wife and I've been together 7 years.  the first 5 were rough financially VERY rough.  But I started my business 3 years ago and it shook and wobbled then took off.  We decided we'd both work retail and let that money build.  At the beginning of 2020 we were stable and settled.  We were looking forward to going to the beach for a weekend (she's never been) going to the big city a couple times a month to party and let her let her hair down.  Did we make it to the beach?  Nope.  We only got to a club once before the outbreak happened.  After that Nyet.  I had also been honing my skills as a DJ and hoping to find a job in a club somewhere pretty close.  I was fairly famous at it once and I'd like to be again. Plus it would have given her an opportunity to go out and have fun every weekend and be safe.  Thank you COVID Karens and hang wringing pussies for completely fucking 2020 for us.  Want to go for a bonus round in 2021?  It wouldn't fucking surprise me at all</p>

        <p>The original virus was never even properly verified or isolated. It doesn’t even meet the standards of the Koch postulate. In short, the virus DOES NOT EXIST, or at least doesn’t exist in any form verified by the CDC, the WHO, or any other medical organization.</p>

        <p>Upvote for accuracy. The whole thing is a scam to rebrand the annual seasonal illness that affects the elderly and immuno compromised.  Our lives are being destroyed mentally and financially to the point of reliance on the ones who created the problem for help. </p>
<p>I see no end in sight to the rebranding and continued fear mongering by MSM and big tech. Total control is the agenda and we're just getting started.</p>

        <p>Nah, mate, this theory lost credibility in July for me atleast. I was in contact, few day later got sick and then my entire family including .......grandma and grandpa. Those who were in a bad shape, took them like a week and a half to be back in action. The rest had it for  a day or two. Not worth losing a year of my life if you ask me. My mother had TB and dad had a heart attack when I was a kid, those were scary moments, covid was pretty meh in comparison.</p>

        <p>I couldn’t find any study done about this ‚UK mutation‘. Most scientists said not to worry about it too much, but politicians ‚believe’ that it’s more dangerous. It’s a bad joke.</p>

<p>This shouldn't be enough to stay safe by anyone's logic. Masks prevent people who have the virus from spreading it much more that they prevent someone from inhaling it.</p>

        <p>I want to see then. Based on what they do the calculations. Numbers, percentages, formulae, peer reviews by non-government affiliated epidemiologists and mathematicians.  Until then I call BS</p>
<p>Point 2: I am not sure what to think about. I have been multiple times on r/Coronavirus and the mask cult is trying to push both theories as equally true. If masks dont work and you ignored the almighty SOCIAL DISTANCE! then I guess we need to see rule 3 of the Church of Covid:Stay at home. Simple, people at risk, stay at home. They have younger family members or volunteers do the grocery, buy medications. They will leave the house in extreme circumstances only. Wouldn`t isolating the sick and elderly be smarter than isolation for everyone. It is like needing to have a finger amputated, but the doctor cuts off the wrist just to make sure.</p>

<p>Until you get handed evidence without doing research you call BS and believe the exact opposite. IMO that's just as bad as straight up believing what you read in headlines.</p>
<p>&rt; Point 2: I am not sure what to think about. I have been multiple times on r/Coronavirus and the mask cult is trying to push both theories as equally true.</p>
<p>Once again, some research besides reddit and second hand information is crucial. It's easy to read through reddit and find a bunch of "expert comments" with a couple of sources that support any view for any matter. Look up the different kinds of masks, what they filter and what they don't. Looking up stuff from before covid-19 to find unbiased info on how masks work is crucial in understanding it.</p>
<p>&rt; Simple, people at risk, stay at home. They have younger family members or volunteers do the grocery, buy medications.</p>
<p>What do you consider a person at risk? Are those people who need to be hospitalized to beat the virus or the people who would die?</p>
