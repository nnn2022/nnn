        <p>I don’t mind vaccinations, but not the current Covid ones without long term use, and I know for a fact this bill was only created and passed to make sure children and anyone else in public school get a complete Covid vaccination at least once.</p>

        <p>&rt;The bill does not force children to be vaccinated, but it does bar unvaccinated children who do not qualify for medical or religious exemptions from enrolling in school.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: Sure, we'll never force your children to be vaccinated! Of course not, but G-d damn it, if you sure as Hell want to participate in society, guess what? You better roll up that sleave because we're putting our toxic sludge into you, whether you like it or not! Oh yeah, did we mention you can't sue the vaccine manufacturer?!</p>
<p>&rt;"Vaccines are safe. We need them to keep our children protected in daycares and schools," said Amy Pisani of Vaccinate Your Family.</p>
<p><strong>Translation</strong>: Look you damn peons, Bill Gates or Big Pharma is probably paying me to say this, so I am going to say it, our toxic sludge is so safe, we know what is best for your children even in the event that your children are injured from taking experimental medical treatments, er, I mean, a FDA approved unlicensed "vaccine."</p>
<p>Folks, if they can mandate this to your children for the privilege of going to a public school, imagine what is coming next under the guise to "protect you." </p>
<p>So much for CONnecticut being the "Constitution State."</p>

        <p>Vaccines have helped create autoimmune and cancer treatment franchises for Rockefeller/Big Pharma.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/goldman-asks-is-curing-patients-a-sustainable-business-model.html">Goldman Sachs asks in biotech research report: ‘Is curing patients a sustainable business model?’</a></p>
<p>&rt;”As of 2003, SV40 had been found in human tumours in 18 developed countries. Bookchin and Schumacher claim that the rates of SV40-positive tumours seem highest in countries that used the greatest amount of contaminated Salk polio vaccine, including the UK, USA, and Italy.” ^1</p>
<p>&rt;“DOCTOR FORESEES A NATION OF INVALIDS</p>
<p>&rt;Dr. S. S. Goldwater, New York Commissioner of Hospitals pointed out in The Modern Hospital Magazine that the present measures used to check contagious diseases may permit of longer life — but not of stronger life. As a result of the drugs, vaccines and other suppressive treatments used to check diseases, he says that, "chronic diseases are growing at such a rate that America may become a nation of invalids. Over half the hospital beds are filled with chronic sufferers, both old and young." (from Health Practitioner’s Journal, June, 1944)” ^2</p>
<p>&rt;"Harry Nelson, Medical Editor for L.A. Times, reported on an American Cancer Society Seminar for Science Writers, and announced that microbiologists have uncovered new findings that incriminate vaccination. One of the participants was <strong>Dr. Robert M. Simpson of Rutgers University, N.J., who stressed that ‘Immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps, and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form proviruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body</strong> ...Some of these could be molecules in search of a disease, which under proper conditions become activated and <strong>cause a variety of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Parkinson’s disease and perhaps cancer."</strong> This quote is from the Honorof Report for June, 1976.” ^3</p>
<p>&rt;“Many so-called "medical discoveries", however, have been announced by the Rockefeller Institute.  Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever.  <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable purposes</strong> and have been <strong>exploited commercially</strong> and intensively.” ^4</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”In the great majority of cases the toll of the major killing diseases of the nineteenth century declined dramatically before the discovery of medical cures and even immunization</strong> ^5</p>
<p>&rt;”Similarly, for England and Wales John Powles shows that <strong>overall mortality declined</strong> over the last hundred years <strong>well in advance of specific immunizations and therapies.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Rene Dubos, the microbiologist</strong> formerly with the Rockefeller Institute, succinctly summed up the historical record. <strong>”The tide of infectious and nutritional diseases was rapidly receding when the laboratory scientist moved into action at the end of the past century,"</strong> Dubos wrote in Mirage of Health. "In reality," he observed, <strong>”the monstrous specter of infection had become but an enfeebled shadow of its former self by the time serums, vaccines, and drugs became available to combat microbes.</strong>”</p>
