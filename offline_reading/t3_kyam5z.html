    <strong>My dad took the vaccine! ðŸ˜¬ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜³</strong>
    <p><p>So quick story, my dad is a P.T in an old folks nursing home and his company required all employees to get it once it was offered. He was somewhat skeptical but didn't protest when he got it. I don't remember whether it was the phizer or Moderna one, I do know it was distributed by Walgreens or cvs. He is 54 yrs old, 5.6 ft, about 160 lbs, likely has a wasp allergy, well in shape and healthy, suffers from narcolepsy and high blood pressure (takes some medication for both), I.B.S, and has had both shoulders torn and has had surgery in the last 10 years for both. Other than that he's mostly fine but stressed and tired with work. </p>
<p>I have heard multiple stories of people dying or having horrible health effects towards the vaccines such as that woman and her nonstop seizures. Some were healthy and some had preexisting problems. Its been 24 hours since he's gotten it and nothing so far but I'm still concered. Do I have reason to be worried to high hell or am I honestly overreacting?</p></p>

        <p>Thank you all for your comments. Its been 2 days now since he's got it and he's still fine for now, but I still wanna keep an eye on him. Still not super trusting of it. Let me know if any of you got it and whether it did nothing or messed you up. Curious for feedback and thanks!</p>

        <p>The vast majority of people will experience no major side effects and will be protected, just like any other vaccine. Allergies to the ingredients are the biggest concern, but with a rushed vaccine and no real consultation with a primary care physician that knows his complete medical history, itâ€™s a toss up. If nothing immediate happened, heâ€™s 99.9% going to be okay. Long term effects are still in question due to the rapid development and implementation.</p>

        <p>We know nothing about the long term effects of a mRNA vaccine, hate to break it to you. We have zero idea if he will be okay. No one can say that with 99.9% accuracy. Also, have you looked over at the covid vaccinated sub? Many people reporting symptoms days after, not immediately. I do not want to scaremonger the OP, but I also do not want to spread false information.</p>

        <p>I literally said the long term effects are still in question. I will personally NOT get the vaccine, but anecdotal evidence does not equal scientific evidence. I am not anti-vax, I am anti rushed vaccines. I have been vaccinated for virtually everything there is due to military requirements, but I donâ€™t take a yearly flu vaccine because those are rushed out EVERY year with unintended side effects. Donâ€™t worry about me, Iâ€™ve followed the news from every side, scientific, and anecdotal evidence. I am a low risk group, so I will not get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>I think the issue is your first sentence: </p>
<p>&rt; The vast majority of people will experience no major side effects and will be protected, just like any other vaccine. </p>
<p>That statement is directly at odds with your last sentence: </p>
<p>&rt; Long term effects are still in question due to the rapid development and implementation.</p>
<p>The accurate way to phrase that first sentence is, </p>
<p>&rt; To date, the data shows that the vast majority of people will experience no major side effects <strong>in the short term</strong> and will be protected, just like any other vaccine.</p>

        <p>Your comment is in line with my original comment in its full context, yes. Just like any vaccine, most will experience no side effects, a very small minority will experience mild side effects, and even smaller minority within that will experience severe side effects. This is all in the vaccine literature. No medicine or vaccine is without side effects, it is up to the patient and their doctor to determine if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks.</p>

<p><strong>In the short term.</strong></p>
<p>There is evidence for that claim, but limited to the short term. </p>
<p>You cannot make claims beyond the available data.</p>

        <p>Your position is logically inconsistent. You cannot simultaneously claim that </p>
<p>&rt; You canâ€™t possibly know the long term effects because itâ€™s a new vaccine.</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>&rt; Scientific peer-reviewed research from these companies/institutions and the FDA and CDC have claimed [that the vast majority of people will experience no major side effects and will be protected, just like any other vaccine]. </p>
<p>Really, really think about what you just wrote. Forget vaccines, apply it to anything. </p>
<p><strong>It is impossible to know X until some time in the future, but authorities have already claimed X and therefore X must be true.</strong></p>
<p>With all due respect, the willful stupidity behind that statement is staggering - you clearly know better, yet promptly throw out your correct knowledge because people you consider authorities tell you to do so. </p>
<p>&rt; I personally cannot reject modern medicine and scientific practices, there are trials and documentation that have been presented to Trumpâ€™s administration that have said this vaccine is safe.</p>
<p>Yes - they have established short term safety. They have NOT established long term safety, as you already <strong>know</strong> to be true: <strong>you cannot draw long term conclusions from short term data.</strong></p>
<p>&rt; If we canâ€™t trust the scientific method and peer-reviewed research on medical technologies, who can we trust?</p>
<p>Well, if you have a brain and are willing to use it, you should trust your brain - youâ€™ve already drawn the logically correct, evidence based conclusion: we have established short term safety but have no knowledge whatsoever about long term safety ... therefore, we can say it is safe short term but <strong>cannot</strong> yet say it is safe long term. </p>
<p>They are <em>guessing</em> about long term safety. Unfortunately, thatâ€™s not even an educated guess in this case because the mRNA technology is brand new (if they were using tried and true vaccine tech, then theyâ€™d have a basis for an educated guess). </p>
<p>But itâ€™s nonetheless a safe bet for them - no liability and, in the event of real problems down the road, causation will likely be nigh impossible to prove. Even still, problems deferred typically mean responsibility dodged, so none of the people making this bet will be held accountable for it IF anything should go wrong later on. </p>
<p>I say that, by the way, as a huge fan of vaccines. I just took my mom to get the shingles vaccine, and Iâ€™m thoroughly vaccinated myself. But, like you, I am extremely wary of a rushed vaccine because I understand that the lack of data means we have no basis for assuming long term safety. </p>
<p>Unlike you, I stand by that conclusion even though it is deeply uncomfortable to accept that scientists and politicians are declaring a vaccine entirely <em>safe</em> when they have only evidence of short-term safety and have no clue about safety beyond a few months.</p>

        <p>Your argument, at the end, is only about long term safety. I havenâ€™t said itâ€™s safe long term, because itâ€™s not been proven. The research we have now indicates itâ€™s safe in the short term. This is also why I wonâ€™t be getting the vaccine. Thanks, you proved my point.</p>

        <p>But you described it as safe. </p>
<p>Unless you specify short-term, absolutely everyone will assume you mean that it is safe both short term <em>and</em> long term - that is the universal meaning conveyed by an unqualified statement of safety. </p>
<p>If you do not mean to communicate that, you should always qualify your statement accordingly.</p>
