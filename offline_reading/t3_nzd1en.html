    <strong>Canadians: You have no rights</strong>
    <p><p>Let me start off by saying i am a Nova Scotia resident on file, but have been residing in New Brunswick with my girlfriend for a year now. I work and live in NB.</p>
<p>Through the "pandemic" i was travelling freely between the two provinces when the atlantic bubble was open, 3, 4 times a week. But ever since this recent lockdown and closing of the bubble because of the "outbreak" in NS. Nova Scotia and the border have become a police province.</p>
<p>2 weeks ago i travelled from NB to NS during the peak of the ns "outbreak" i had no problem getting in to ns or getting back in nb the following day.</p>
<p>Fast forward to yesterday night, i travelled back to ns for the weekend, got in just fine didnt even check my id
However when i was coming back to NB i met the most power drunk corrupt nazis that put our country to shame.</p>
<p>I told them i was going home and going to work, they asked for proof of residence and or a paystub. Since i get paid in cash and my name is not on the lease of my girlfriends parents house i showed them texts and job addresses from my boss in nb, i showed them multiple mailing addresses next to my name when i ordered packages to NB. Wasn't enough.</p>
<p>When i told them i'd like to exercise my charter rights section 6 freedom of mobility he brushed me aside and told me "those dont matter" and im the only one that could let me through. I immediately demanded i speak to a rcmp officer and told him he is not god and is not say all to end all.  They refused to call an rcmp officer until i told them i wasnt leaving and this is in violation of section 6 and i demand i speak to a man of the law.</p>
<p>After 20 minutes i had 6 officers outside my window : 2 rcmp, 4 peace officers (clowns). The peace officers started badmouthing me to the police immediately when they arrived saying we have reason to believe i was high and drunk (i wasnt) they immediately demand me get out and supply a breathlyzer. So i go to take a drink of my water and this fucker slaps it out my hand. Tells me i may not drink until i give him his breathlyzer so i get out and pass their stupid fucking test even though they had no reasonable cause. </p>
<p>He then tells me i may not go home and go to work because the health order trumps our charter rights and basically whatever these peace officers say is law.
This is the Canada we live in folks. We are living in a totalitarian dictatorship. We are no longer the true north strong and free. Public health orders are more important than your rights. This is Chinada.</p></p>

        <p>We are not citizens of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, BC or Alberta. We are Canadian citizens. You were right to push back citing charter rights and freedoms but unfortunately arguing with the type of police officer you described is like taunting the Albanian mafia - no good can come out of it.  </p>
<p>The one thing i will mention is that the UK and many other freer countries are still plagued by tyrannical police. I got stopped and forcefully drug tested for riding my motorcycle too far from home... You heard that right. Essex police thought me venturing 30 miles from home was probable cause for a drug test. Really sympathise with your story....</p>

        <p>The issue here is that Canada does not have a constitution that has teeth with a 2nd Amendment to back it up. But let us put that aside for the moment.</p>
<p>Even here in America, where do have a constitution, the civilian police are still violating it and we still have a 2nd Amendment to protect it. The problem is that since these bureaucrats and unelected anti-constitutional bigots hear the word "emergency" they think that is a license to violate people's rights. Almost every tyranny in the world has done this, and if you think that this is just an anomaly, you're sadly mistaken. </p>
<p>But why in Canada are they doing this? Well, for one, you the citizenry are disarmed, and therefore only the government has the guns, so you're easily controlled. Your culture, mindset AND law does not allow, protect or guarantee that form of protection from the government. Sure, on paper, "Charter of Rights" sounds great, but in practically? Horrible! Your country is still ruled by a monarchy that couldn't give less then two shits about you because it is rules for thee, and not for me.</p>
<p>Now look, it sounds like I am being hard on your country, unfortunately, yes I am. But there are patriot Canadians that are not having it, and are speaking out, and that is a good thing because the spirit of resistance is growing. People are getting pissed off, losing their businesses, livelihoods, families, their homes. And just like them pesky 13 colonies back in 1776, when you have nothing left to lose, that makes you very dangerous, because you have nothing left to fear.</p>

        <p>You know, I have to tell you that until these events happened, I was all against your second amendment, didn't want to hear that it's there to protect you, called bullshit on it.     </p>

        <p>Restricting purchases has a downside in that it would enable the government to theoretically ban people from buying guns at the government's discretion. Very dangerous road. True, some very bad people will be able to gain access to weapons, but that's a far better situation than descending into full-blown tyranny. Moreover, the hypothetical bad people buying guns will ideally be met by good people with similar guns, so you end up in a stand-off situation where fewer people get injured due to mutually assured destruction. At that point, it's not really an issue anymore. Moreover, if our education system in the USA were allowed to flourish properly then we would, I think, have fewer "bad people" in the first place, assuming people received a classical education and were simultaneously educated on the merits of morality.</p>

        <p>I get that, what you're saying makes sense I suppose. It's just if I was to ever visit the US, I don't think I'd ever feel safe.      </p>
<p>In central Europe I know that the likelyness of getting shot is basically 0, no matter if cop or thug  and I like that feeling. I've never sat at my steering wheel, too afraid to move and possibly get shot if I'd do otherwise, I've in fact gotten out of the car in 90% of cases to approach the police and was never met with a pulled weapon or hand on a holster.     </p>
<p>So I'm sure you see where I'm coming from. This is an extremely difficult matter. I don't think that - hear me out here - restricting people in buying weapons would be an issue if that right was additionally protected and the current structure of governments changed, empowering the actual population, not the morons who think they can control who- and whatever they want, who are currently sitting in government.     </p>
<p>Looking at the current situation though and at the people in power, this is possibly the best law that ever happened to the US, negatives to be disregarded.</p>

        <p>That’s awful. I wish the police in Canada understood that their enforcement of this Covid tyranny is antagonizing the very people they serve and protect. People in America would lose their shit if they tried to implement domestic travel restrictions like Canada is doing.</p>

        <p>Half the battle is just fighting back and the videos I've seen show most Canadians shrugging their shoulders whenever new restrictions are implemented on them. It's not the best in the US but our stereotype on Americans being loud is a good thing because in this case it means our voices are heard.</p>

        <p>I hope you got video and names of the 'officers' so you can commence legal action against them. Depending on your reasons for visiting NS (I understand you probably have family there, and maybe were gathering within the limits - at least you can say so if there is no proof against that), I think this case would have a chance of proceeding and getting you a settlement of some kind. Of course this depends on what they actually did to you - did they detain you, illegally search you, give you a ticket?</p>
<p>Edit: it also sounds like you may be missing days of work and paying additional expenses due to this, I would talk to a (free through legal aid) lawyer if I were you see if they think anything can be done. And yes I'm aware Canada is a crap country with a crap charter, but that doesn't mean there aren't times that the police act unjustifiably and can lose.</p>

        <p>You seem like the type who thinks that the Slippery Slope is a fallacy.</p>
<p>History has shown us that it is not. </p>
<p>In the last year governments have said:<br>
What sexual positions you should be using.<br>
Who you can kiss.<br>
Who you can hug.<br>
The right way to greet people.<br>
Who you can have in your home.<br>
Who can be with you when you’re dying.<br>
What countries you can travel to. (referring here to Canada's PM cancelling flights to "sunny destinations" to keep the plebs at home during winter; not talking about regular border-entry controls.)<br>
When you can leave your home.<br>
If you can leave your home.<br>
If your business can stay open or not.<br>
If your child can go to school or not.<br>
If your child can play on a playground.<br>
If you can sit on the beach.<br>
If you can go to the park.<br>
How many people you can socialize with when you’re outdoors.<br>
Where in your region/state/country you can travel to.<br>
Where you can go for a walk.<br>
Whether or not you can buy clothing for your children.<br>
That as a healthy person you may need to agree to a medical treatment in order to participate in normal life in the coming months.<br>
And now they’re saying that if you question any of the above, you’re a far-right white supremacist conspiracy theorist. Please shut the fuck up.</p>

        <p>I can't believe this. Have you not had a single class on ethics in school? Or maybe some innate ability to recognize what's right or wrong? Or a smidgen of some moral competence? Some empathy, maybe? Just because there are new emergency laws from an authority figure, it doesn't necessarily mean that they are moral or ethical.</p>

        <p>No, it sure doesn't sound like it. It's like you think tyranny is just going to show up and announce itself as such that anyone can recognize it and stop it. You don't think it can shape shift to suit a modern narrative like covid and present itself in the form of fear-driven news, skewed statistics, shame tactics, coercion, material incentives, censoring, withholding certain information but highlighting other information all to lead you to believe that the government is taking care of you and doing everything for your own good, even if it means restricting your movements and putting something in your body that you're not comfortable with.</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter. Just because it's right for YOU, doesn't mean it's right for everyone. Everyone has their reasons based on an accumulation of past experiences or their own research or personal conviction to accept or refuse an experimental invasive treatment. That's the bottom line.</p>
