        <p>It's all about filtering their fiat currency for physical assest like land, business, factories, production, gold, silver and all other commodities. The whole world is in on it. Thats why a pandemic was the perfect crisis to have. They know when the stock market and the dollar collapses the world economy collapses. the rich and powerful need to quickly and quietly sell their stock holdings and spend their fiat currency on physical assest like land and commodities. Why do you think they are printing trillions of dollars and only giving a few billion to the people. Which that money goes to most of them anyways because most of the small businesses closed for good. Which I'm sure they kindly bought up their business and land at pennies on the dollar. As soon as they stop paying peoples rent and mortgage I'm sure they will scooping those up as well. Besides it's not real money and the more your holding when it's worthless is less assests they could of stolen from the people. If you don't own your home before the currency collapses. Well the bank will own your home or who ever buys it with the new digital currency. Don't worry tho. You will be to busy fighting with your neighbor about masks, vaccines, democrats republican, and climate change as the reason for this economic disaster. While the real people who caused it our buying up everything of value with your tax dollars. Just like the bs pandemic. The government will have a solution. Digital currency. You will get a very shitty return rate for your fiat currency (if you have any left). You will be allowed to stay in your home but you have to rent it. You can no longer own it. Have fun people</p>
