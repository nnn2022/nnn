        <p>That's because in the 1960s your parents fed you proper portions and kicked your ass out of the house when the sun came up and you actually played out doors all day. You got a job in your teens. You were an adult by 18, not the 26 year old "adults" required to be a dependent on your healthcare by law that we have today.</p>
<p>Pretending vaccines are the only difference is laughable.</p>

        <p>I invite you to just dig a little deeper into this. It's definitely uncomfortable territory to question the sacred cow that is vaccines, as we've been told for a lifetime they are "safe and effective." But what about this new one? It's not been proven safe, yet they are unleashing it on everyone anyway. This is not new for pharma.  </p>
<p>In fact, the DTP vaccine killed thousands of babies in the 80s (they called it "SIDS"), and there were so many lawsuits that they threatened to stop making vaccines altogether if they weren't granted total immunity from damages. And guess what? Under Regan, The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Act (1986) was born. Ever since, there has been almost no incentive for pharma to make a safe product, because they quite literally are not liable. </p>
<p>Here's a fun fact: Not a single vaccine has been tested using an inert placebo. Not one. A couple COVID trials did use saline, but that was due to the work of a few nonprofit "anti-vaxxer" groups through lawyers, demanding it.   </p>
<p>It's really hard, I know. But if you've been reading the headlines, you see how fucked up it is, right? Lying, hiding study data, over-inflating efficacy, under-reporting adverse events? Well imagine knowing that shit was always happening  - that Autism IS caused by vaccines and is listed as an adverse event, along with diabetes myelitis, epilepsy and brain damage) in the inserts - And people called you a crazy lunatic for knowing it, or ruined your career if you were a doctor and spoke about it. Or fired you if you were a reporter and went off-script in a news cast and asked the wrong questions. This shit has happened for YEARS!  </p>
<p>Pharma relies on our cognitive dissonance, and of course their outright control of the media, the narrative and of course, the entire medical industry. But people are starting to wake up. I am thankful, for that one tiny ray of light in all this, that people are questioning things and not blindly "trusting the science" anymore.   </p>
<p>Here's the recent study showing the health outcomes of vaccinated vs. unvaccinated kids. I think you may see it's not so "laughable" anymore.<br>

        <p>I'm too lazy/too busy to develop a sophisticated enough understand of the science behind vaccines.</p>
<p>Mandatory bad. Liability immunity bad.</p>
<p>Voluntary good.</p>

<p>Buddy, you are trying way too hard on me. Pretending vaccines are the only difference from the 1960s is laughable, not prophetic.</p>

        <p>You can take most any other 60 year time period in the history of man, and life was not too different from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Choosing the pre-digital age to post-digital age - the differences are like caveman to modern man in that 60 year span.</p>
<p>You can't "control" for that. Believing you can is the same kind of blind belief in "science" that priests have for religion.</p>
