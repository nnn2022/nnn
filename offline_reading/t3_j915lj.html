    <strong>“Welcome to Bergeron!” Vonnegut’s Dystopian Satirical Fiction Slouches Its Way Into Depressing Reality.</strong>

<p>“America is becoming Bergeron – a new country based on the principles laid out in Kurt Vonnegut’s depressingly prescient short story, <em>Harrison Bergeron</em>.</p>
<p>It is a country in which – as in the book – you may not act if anyone of lesser strength or ability or drive cannot act at the same level. You must accommodate yourself to <em>their</em> level.</p>
<p>Everything is leveled – ever downward.</p>
<p>Until all are depressingly . . . <em>equal.</em></p>
<p>In misery. In poverty. In thrall to suffocating edicts limiting what they are <em>permitted</em> to do – and told they must not do – on the basis of what others can’t do. Or resent you for being <em>able</em> to do, which they can’t...  </p>
<p>“And now – because granny might die – everyone is treated as if they, too, were a granny and might die.</p>
<p>Healthy people at very little to no risk of death from catching a cold must live in perpetual fear of death. If they don’t fear it, having no reason to – they must be forced to act – and <em>look</em> – as if they did...”</p></p>

<p>It’s easy to see this mechanism throughout modern contemporary culture. The strong artificially weakened, the weak artificially ‘strengthened’; the most intelligent suppressed, the stupid celebrated. The promise of a just redistribution of wealth never seems to be fulfilled this way. The wheel of fortune gets a half-turn and the other half of the world starts to suffer.  </p>
<p>Why rights seem to be a finite resource, whereby increased rights for some result in a decrease for others, is beyond me. Can’t we raise up the oppressed without destroying those currently and historically ascendant? Can’t we fast-track the most able, while simultaneously protecting and supporting the most vulnerable? Or is it all about revenge?</p>

        <p>once again you post good stuff, this time by the ever eloquent ep (note the lack of collective possessive pronouns in his writings) and once again your reply devolves into non-referential collective possessive obscurity.</p>
<p>&rt; Can’t <em>we</em> raise up the oppressed without destroying <em>those</em> currently and historically ascendant? </p>
<p>who the fuck is 'we? you don't define them.</p>
<p>raise up the oppressed? who is id that is doing the oppressing? get rid of the oppressors , then the oppressed wont need 'raising up' becuase they won't be oppressed</p>
<p>who are 'those' "currently ascendant"?  what does 'currently ascendant' even mean?</p>
<p>&rt; Can’t we fast-track the most able</p>
<p>again, who is 'we'? who decides what 'most able' is? who decides who is 'most abled'? </p>
<p>&rt; while simultaneously protecting and supporting the most vulnerable? 
protection require subjection, no thanks. what is 'support'? do you mean pay for them?</p>
<p>&rt; Or is it all about revenge?</p>
<p>wot?</p>
<p>up vote for the post though, because ep</p>

        <p>I still consider myself a part of a collective humanity, despite feeling increasingly alienated from that concept day by day. Maybe that’s my philosophical mistake, but I prefer to refer to ‘we’ than ‘they’. Whether or not Bergeron’s core concepts were made or even agreed to by us, they make up our shared zeitgeist now and will prove hard to shift.</p>
<p>Of course protection requires subjection. That’s the whole point of the welfare system and victim culture in general etc. Since we aren’t ridding ourself of that any time soon, I was wondering why it can’t be kept in place while still ensuring merit and talent per se is rewarded in our society.</p>
<p>Revenge seems a given right now. Hard to dispute it when most leftist leaders are saying as much. Kalergi plan etc. What do you expect when you radicalise and victimise one swath of the population, while demonising and scapegoating another?</p>

<p>that's where you go wrong. every step in the wrong direction takes you farther away. </p>
<p>there is no fucking 'collective'. 'we' are not a 'herd'. because 'we' are only animals physically.  </p>
<p>revenge for what, exactly?</p>
<p>too much fucking 'we'.</p>
<p>is the 'kalergi plan', YOUR plan? no, it is not. stop believing it is when you have nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>i am not radicalizing or victimizing anyone, are you? if so, knock it off. if not, why claim that you are?</p>
