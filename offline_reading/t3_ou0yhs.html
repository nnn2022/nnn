        <p>Numbers have been crystal clear since May 2020</p>
<p>People that still believe the bullshit they're fed from CNN haven't looked at numbers, they're not able to do so, and have no intention to do that anytime soon.</p>

        <p>I had a similar discussion with a friend who was talking about the young and healthy people in the UK who  had died from covid</p>
<p>First point is it is with and not from</p>
<p>second point was at the time of the discussion there were just under 90 fatalities in the 18 - 40 age group with no <strong>known health conditions f</strong>rom the start of the pandemic</p>
<p>Third point was that in the UK 500 young people drop dead every year from SADS, the reason for the deaths usually relate to unknown congenital heart defects, these are only discovered during a PM at a coroners request</p>
<p>Post mortems have essentially been scrapped during the pandemic and anyone testing positive for covid would have just been classed as a covid death irrespective, just wondering how many of these "healthy" young covid casualties would have fallen into to the SADS category in previous years</p>
