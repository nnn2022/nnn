        <p>Wow. Great video.</p>
<p>I transcribe things for my notes sometimes, for future discussion and planning -- trying to map the trajectory we're on so I can prepare in advance for where it is going...</p>
<p>Anyhow -- here's my rough transcription of part of what was in the video. It's kind of amazing that he warns of masks and quarantines in 2014:</p>
<p>Harry Vox in 2014:</p>
<p>&rt;During the pandemic, they flexed their authority. Listen to this. And even super markets, they want body and temperature checks. They're building a system where every move you make you have to go through them. And here's the good stuff now, I mean it just keeps getting better:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;(quoting the Rockefeller "Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development" section called "Lock Step.")<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"Even after the pandemic faded, this more authoritarian control and oversight of citizens and their activities stuck. And even intensified.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And that's the whole point.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So even when there's no more ebola, well you know what -- we kinda like this because we have a complete infrastructure, a control grid.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"In order to protect themselves from the spread of increasingly global problems, from pandemics, and national terrorism to environmental crises and rising poverty, leaders around the world took a firmer grip on power."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Well... What the hell would rising poverty have anything to do with imposing strict citizen controls.. with facemasks?!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Very sloppy stuff here.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;At first, the notion of a more controlled world "gained wide acceptance and approval"<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;(Harry Vox is in disbelief)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I'm sorry -- NOBODY likes this stuff. They're just saying it!<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"Citizens willingly gave up some of their sovereignty and their privacy to more paternalistic states in exchange for greater safety &amp; stability."<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I mean, that's just a complete naked contradiction to the famous saying that if you're going to give up your freedom to get security, you're going to get neither.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;They want to get more control. It's going to be curfews and quarantines.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Unless the American people start to get a new way to revolt - a new way to organize - a new way to protest. Unless we canbreak through the apathy --<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;It's going to be a slave state here.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The ruling class doesn't seem to have too much resistance. They're getting everything...<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;They've been wanting quarantines and curfews for a long time -- now they got it.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And if you want to live in a world where you're tricked into all this stuff because it's "for your safety" and if you want to have a probe and if you want to be monitored --<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;If that's the world you want to live in, be apathetic. Don't do anything. You're going to get that world very soon. It's coming your way, definitely.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Wake up, learn about it. And go fight these bastards in Washington. They're easy to beat. If we can just organize we can beat them. It's simple. They're weak, and there's so few of them...</p>
<p>He also talked about:</p>
<p>&rt;National Security Memorandum #200, Henry Kissinger.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;December 10, 1974<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; National Security Council<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; Memorandum (NSSM) 314<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; November 26, 1975<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; Declassified/Released on 7/3/89 <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;under provisions of E.O. 12356 by F. Graboske, National Security Council</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And that was incredible. It's 123 boring pages long but there is some juicy information in there about the soft &amp; gentle policies put into place to slow population growth... And they did it! They put us 20 years behind projections --- however, we are now where they warned we'd be in 2020 --- that that is surely connected to the increased authoritarianism we are experiencing now.</p>
<p>And possibly the vaccines, and if not these vaccines then it certainly will be related in the future.</p>
<p>But there's no mention of that in the declassified document... Just other "more sensible" policies.</p>
<p>It does make mention of "alternative viewpoints" that would justify force and coercion in regards to population control.</p>
<p>The word "depopulation" isn't in there.</p>
<p>It's not an "exciting document" if that's what you're looking for, BUT it's proof that they have been hardcore working on reducing population since at least 1975.</p>
<p>It talks hesitantly about abortion, and the importance of abortion in relation to population control -- but that due to certain rules they can't support it directly, but they can fund nations where possible.</p>
<p>(I read into that -- if a country wants to put money into abortions, we can fund them as long as their own money is used for encouraging abortion. And of course, anyone who knows about funding -- once you give someone more money then the money they already have becomes extra and they can do with it what they want. So I saw this as a document that very carefully words around the more extreme actions they're taking.)</p>
<p>Still, very interesting.</p>
