    <strong>Why do vegans seem to be offended by the suggestion that maybe lockdowns do not help?</strong>
    <p><p>I understand why vegans tend to be offended by the suggestion that COVID-19 is a virus that is intentionally genetically modified, by some technology that is somehow kept secret. That is a ridiculous claim and perhaps made by people who want to justify eating meat that way. I understand why vegans tend to be offended by the suggestion people eating bats may not be the actual reason we have to deal with COVID, but that it was unintentionally leaked from some laboratory. That claim is not supported by evidence (although it is not as ridiculous), and it is presumably made by people who want to justify eating meat that way.</p>
<p>What I fail to understand is why vegans tend to be offended by the suggestion that lockdowns may do more harm than good. This is what I posted on a Discord server about veganism and they muted me for that, and will probably ban me:</p>
<p>&rt;I am sorry for your loss. And I know it is natural to want to do everything one can to prevent that from happening in the future. However, you need to consider that even if those people did not get COVID, there is a high chance they still would not be alive now. If it was not for COVID, something else (maybe an influenza) would be the drop of water that spilled the glass. And even if they indeed died from COVID, rather than with COVID, it is unlikely that people abiding the government regulations would have prevented that. Masks, as they are usually worn, are probably only around 20% effective for COVID. It is hard to tell, since the largest study ever done about it, the Danish study, involving 3000 people, is only powerful enough to detect effects as large as 46%, which it, of course, failed. As for lockdowns, I have no idea how one might scientifically study whether they work. If they work at all, it is to "flatten the curve", and, in order to do that, they need to be implemented very early. It is too late for that. I can understand it is hard to accept government actions (apart from the very counter-productive Cuomo's policy of putting COVID patients into nursing homes not to overwhelm the hospitals) have little effect on the virus, but that is the reality. Once again, I am sorry for your loss. But stiffling most of the car traffic is not a solution for car accidents. Similarly, shutting down most businesses and putting people in jail for not wearing masks is not a solution for COVID.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;By the way, what do you guys here think, is it true that Vitamin D boosts the immune system and prevents COVID? This is an honest question. As far as I can tell, there is evidence both for and against that claim. The evidence for that is that there is huge seasonal variation in COVID cases, there are very few COVID cases in summer, when the rate of Vitamin D deficiency is low. Also, there are some studies that show COVID patients are much more likely to be deficient in Vitamin D than the rest of the population. On the other hand, there is, as far as I understand it, no plausible scientific explanation for how Vitamin D can boost the immune system. Also, it is hard to explain how it could help against COVID without also triggering auto-immune diseases. <em>I said earlier that, if it is true, lockdowns can even be counter-productive, because, under a lockdown, people are less on the sun.</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<a href="https://discord.com/channels/747828507278573629/747831712209174659/825954158732378112">https://discord.com/channels/747828507278573629/747831712209174659/825954158732378112</a></p>
<p>Why would the people, who used to be obsessed with the claims that meat is the reason for many of the world's problems, and that animals should be liberated now, be obsessed with requiring lockdowns? I am just having trouble wrapping my head around that. I can understand why the vegan community is rather unfriendly to global warming skepticism, as it kind of seems to go against their narrative (although I think it does not really do that, I do not see why would saying <em>Most of the global warming is probably natural, or, if it is not, it comes from hippies and their happy grass-fed cows, and not from traffic.</em> be offensive to a vegan who is willing to listen), but I just fail to see any logical connection between veganism and the belief that lockdowns help.</p></p>

        <p>you made a whole post about vegans, when in reality your Discord (pro mask/lockdown platform) group is just a subset of the larger doomer community, and has nothing to do with vegans as a whole.</p>

        <p>The way I see it, this is just "special" kind of people. To be clear, I'm not talking about all vegans in general, but those giving up bacon because they believe that will save the world somehow. With this kind of mindset you might well believe that jailing yourself is actually a good thing, and when you attack people's beliefs they do tend to get defensive.</p>

<p>But that makes way more sense than saying lockdowns are justified, does not it? At the very least, it does not require people being thrown into jail for disobeying stupid rules.</p>

        <p>I am a vegetarian and have never met a single vegan who was not a self-righteous, misanthropic Malthusian ecofascist. I know that there are exceptions, but I have never met them. Their obsession with animals is always greater than their concern for other humans. I once had a discussion with a veggieNazi who literally said that people should stop rearing animals for consumption and that those who are Vit B12 and D3 (as all vegans are) should just buy supplements. When asked how nomads in the Sahel, Sahara, Middle East, Eurasian steppes, etc would survive, they replied with "Well, you're not from there." </p>
<p>VeggieNazis are obsessed with lockdowns because they are ecofascists: humans are killing the planet so they must be locked down to prevent anthropogenic global warming from happening. Don't you remember the PlAnEt Is HeAlInG propaganda during the lockdowns?</p>

        <p>I just went last week to an animal rescue fundraiser run by vegans who are against lockdown because they want the animal shelters opened back up. Practically nobody wore masks. I talked to and hugged one of the organizers, and danced and generally had a great time. They had a sign up talking about how a bunch of recent major disease outbreaks were caused by our eating animals, and that was their entire extent of giving a shit about covid19.</p>

        <p>I agree completely. I have been a vegetarian 25 years and went fully vegan after watching What the Health a few months back. I went on some veganism for beginners subs. They attack anyone who is mildly vaccine cautious or gives any hint of being anything but a covid Doomer. I believe the reason for this is because 1. They were always 99% holier than thou types and love mask shaming. 2. They have alot of vegans who are anti big pharma, anti forced vaccination, skeptics, science realists versus science religious zealots, etc. They crack down quick to get rid of those people so that all vegans can keep their hard fought reputation for being super judgemental SJW Karen's. They don't want to get pumped in with covid deniers, and a covid questioner is pretty much a denier...so...</p>

<p>Here's some "doctor's word" on the issue, for one. </p>
<p>If you need a bunch of supplements as an otherwise healthy person, that diet is lacking, it's unnatural, and at BEST it shows your high level of privilege. </p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23346724/</p>
<p>Here's a pubmed source for you.</p>
<p>I'm not interested in the hypotheticals of everyone supplementing their diets with synthetic vitamins being a "viable solution" when the problem doesn't exist in the first place with a traditional diet that has been eaten by people for generations and generations.</p>

<p>Choline is produced in the liver (not enough though) but is also found in plant foods.</p>
<p>DHA is converted in the body from ALA. You can also get it from algae. That's also how fish obtain it.</p>
<p>B12 is originally found in dirt and water. With all the sanitation in modern day society, getting it from these sources is indeed not possible. The only supplement I take is B12.</p>
<p>&rt;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23346724/</p>
<p>&rt;The clinical consequences of an insufficiently mindful vegetarian or vegan diet include many common symptoms such as anxiety, brain fog, depression, fatigue, insomnia, neuropathies and other neurologic dysfunction.</p>
<p>And I fully agree. Proper planning is necessary, but far from difficult.</p>

        <p>The vegans I have met in real life will be open about how they do not have the same level of care or concern for all living things. Humans are an exception to them. Humans are the "earth's natural enemy." </p>
<p>So of course they have no problem dehumanizing people over something like this. They dehumanized people BEFORE covid, why should they stop now?</p>
<p>And before anyone comes in with the "Nooooo there are good kind vegans out there, too! You just didn't know when you met them!" No. The rare exceptions to the rule do not cause me to look at that ideology as a whole in any better light.</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>
<p>Being vegan has nothing to do with dehumanizing people so the vegans you met were just assholes. It has nothing to do with the ideology of veganism itself. I know plenty of meat eaters who are bad people, but I'd never say that meat eaters are bad people by definition.</p>

        <p>I like your take, and I agree with it. The problems in my community don't start OR end with "veganism" for sure ðŸ˜… too bad so many people here DO use it as a weapon that way. I was vegan for a year myself, and I was doing the best research I could the entire time, making my own cultured cheese from my own homemade cashew milk and rejuvilac, avoiding the pre-made garbage from the freezer aisle, etc. and also even took suppliments... I couldn't make it work for my body. I was already on the "skinny" end of my healthy weight range, and I just kept losing more and more weight, finally when my hair started falling out I looked in the mirror and didn't even recognize myself with my sunken in cheeks and generally gaunt look. Stopped there and haven't looked back. I'm not about to tell anyone else that they shouldn't adhere to that diet if that's what they want though... but people SHOULD be informed about whatever choices they make concerning their diet. </p>
<p>Eating a bunch of HFCS, glyphosate ridden grains, and CAFO meat/eggs/dairy is probably WAY more unhealthy than the "average" vegan diet, too.</p>
