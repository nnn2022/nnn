    <strong>I’m 22 and this is wearing on me badly. I’m not a republican doomers so shut up.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m a young person who’s not a republican or whatever the doomers think you guys are. I actually hold a lot of progressive views but I’ve had enough guys. There’s this push from not just the Media but from people i know to get a shot not even a vaccine lmao. But the biggest problem is the lockdowns I’m so tired of people acting like a year of this didn’t do irreversible damage to people’s lives. The people who supported lockdowns for a long time I believe are so deep into Covid fear they subconsciously have to go all the way and double down cuz admitting the government and everything you did for a whole year was a waste would be too much. But my mental is really rough the last year. I got super lucky I had a bad eating disorder and got help in person but not everyone did and kids needed fucking help but it was all Covid Covid covid. I did a depression thing over zoom and I literally didn’t help at all. I haven’t been in school for a year cuz it’s on zoom same tuition rate and it’s ass. The whole point was to save grandma but elderly people decline because they are lonely and if doomers can’t realize that their too stupid. We have people walking around legit out of their mind. Just watch people live everyone is on edge anxious etc. I live in a state that’s controlled by a democrat governor and I’m going to vote for the republican and never vote again. I will never vote for anyone who kept prolonged lockdowns or was in favor of it. Sorry long rant but I’m glad I found u guys.</p></p>

        <p>100 percent I made that statement cuz if you say ur against lockdowns and All of this ur seen as a trump supporting Covid denying anti vax idiot. The most pro Covid people I know are people who I’m sorry are either fat, smoke, or never have taken care of themselves before this year. A girl I work with double masks and is super agressive to people who don’t and she is overweight and vapes. Fuck dude I drink vape and smoke I think Covid is least if my problems</p>

        <p>The point that speaking out is automatically associated with right wing "extremism" is very relevant though- which is what I interpreted to the OP's point.  Dismissing challenges to a faulty narrative on the grounds that the challenges are merely products of partisan politics is a way of avoiding actually supporting a position and could be an admission that the narrative is weak.</p>

The only people who say that are rich fucks like politicians who haven’t lost a damn thing or people who’s mental health has not gone to shit, or someone who hasn’t had a loved one pass without seeing them or a surgery postponed or a business lost.

        <p>I have a friend who is going to die from lung cancer because they couldn’t give him the simple life saving surgery he needed bEcAuSe cOvId.  Anybody who is pro lockdown needs to be bitch slapped so hard they lose some teeth.  The sheep mentality of those people is fucking infuriating.  You’re not alone here buddy, last week in Montreal there were 250,000 of us marching for exactly these reasons.  We are the majority now and you cannot stop the truth once the ball starts rolling no matter how strong the propaganda and brainwashing is.</p>

        <p>I wonder if that person's family can possible sue the hospital for not giving him the needed surgery? I have a feeling lawyers are going to be "crawling out of the wood work" when this pandemic is over.</p>

        <p>My mom almost died a couple of months ago because they kept delaying her surgery due to COVID.  She ended up getting sepsis and was on life support.  She pulled through though.  Even when she was in the hospital it was RUSH RUSH RUSH to get her back on her feet to get her out.</p>

        <p>The folks in the Canada covid subreddits are completely insane. They are taking picture of peoples license plates as they attend "in person" churches. IMO, Canada residents are going to have to step up and fight the most. I can't believe I live less than a 10hr drive from the border there. Thankfully, I can never enter Canada legally anyways due to criminal convictions. What a shit hole of a country.</p>

        <p>The American media "fear mongered" us quite a bit but it seems in Canada their media is even worse and have people terrified even more. It also seems like their society doesn't value children and young adults. They do not give a shit about their people's mental health. Whether they admit it or not parts of Canada is seemingly taking a "Zero Covid" approach which is never going to work.</p>

        <p>I worry sometimes about whether I should be listening more to those I disagree with, but today I found your posts. In a weird way it really puts me at ease to see that this kind of bile is rooted in unapologetic nazism, because it throws a spotlight on how you're shouting from the bottom of a pit of nihilism and hatred.

        <p>No, it's a very intentional choice of specific words directed at your friend nzgs. This is a person who is "agreeing" with your concerns, which I don't really have a problem with. But in doing so is replacing your frustration with the idea that any public worker is a parasite. And this ties into this person's actual support of the literal Nazis.</p>

        <p>I never said hated, and people aren't "scum." You really should pull yourself out of this nosedive into nazism. I'm not buzzwording that, you're actually showing in ripples in glimmers actual support of the real nazis and that should make you realize how far gone you're becoming.  You can't rail about the virtues of reason and science in one post and then wax nostalgic about Hitler in the next.</p>

        <p>You are so wrong about this dude.</p>
<p>I’m sick of the lockdown too.  So is everybody I know.  And you are right that the lockdown causes damage as well.</p>
<p>But I have friends working in medicine who told their stories of when the ER was over capacity.  In one of my university classes we went through the math of simulating disease spread, how a lockdown can help, and what herd immunity means.</p>
<p>The thing about the benefits of the lockdown is that we don’t get to see what would have happened if we did things differently.  The best we can do is to compare what happened in different places that had different rules or followed them to different extents, and to make models and theorize about how things would work differently.</p>
<p>But I do agree that the damage caused by COVID should be weighed against the damage caused by the lockdown.  But that requires <em>dialogue</em> and the echo-chamber attitude of this sub makes you no better than the “doomers” you claim to oppose.</p>

        <p>In the start of this yes. But it’s been a year and the lockdowns don’t make sense anymore and haven’t for a while. We can’t keep thinking about people not getting Covid while we have people
Losing businesses they worked their whole lives to build, overdosing on drugs and killing themselves at some
Of the highest rates. The lockdowns have run their course.</p>

<p>After 14 months of this, I don't care anymore how hard doctors and nurses have it. They can go fuck themselves if they can't handle the pressure. I'm at a point where I think we should just let the elderly folks die of Covid. We need to focus on are young adults and children. They are our future.</p>

        <p>I don’t want to beat a dead horse but you do have examples of what happens in states and countries that didn’t lock down. Sweden now has natural herd immunity. Florida is doing remarkably well considering they have the second largest senior citizen population in the US. Japan wasn’t affected in the slightest because they closed their borders.  Those are just a few places that didn’t lock down. </p>
<p>Also, I am surrounded by people in the medical field. Brother in ER, sister in law in pharmacy,  gf is nurse at major clinic in Los Angeles, good friend is doctor and his two older brothers are doctors. They all say the same thing. It’s overblown, nothing like the media says. The same amount of patients, some months less than usual. </p>
<p>Perhaps this is just anecdotal. Am in LA</p>

        <p>&rt;    Sweden</p>
<p>While they technically didn’t institute a lockdown, they did recommend people stay at home, work from home, study from home, and avoid social gatherings, and the majority of the population followed those guidelines.</p>
<p>&rt;    Japan</p>
<p>There are some countries like Japan (and South Korea!) that avoided having a big issue by acting quickly and strictly.  I 100% agree that approach is more effective. </p>
<p>&rt;    Florida</p>
<p>Florida is the median in ranking among US states in cases per capita.  Maybe it’s impressive that they did “so well” despite reducing lockdown efforts early (they didn’t 100% ban local efforts to enforce lockdowns, organizations like schools and businesses can have their own policies as well).  An examination of some of the states lower on the list would reveal whether they actually did comparatively well compared to states that had longer/stricter lockdowns, or if it’s just that a lot of states didn’t lockdown very much.</p>
<p>The doctors I know are in Idaho, and they’ve seen the ER over capacity due to COVID.  California has fared better than Idaho statically, which may have made the difference.  It could also be the difference in medical facilities between a huge city like LA and a smaller city in Idaho.</p>

        <p>I’m so sorry you’ve had to go through all of that. I’m twice your age, and I feel many of the same things that you do. I know how rough I had it last year. I can’t imagine what young people like you have had to endure. Your twenties should be some of the best times in your life, but yet I’ve seen many people your age living in fear and unhappy. I found this sub because i started to seriously question what was happening and I felt that we were being lied to by social/msm/government. I felt alone because I lost almost all of my friends due to my questioning and my views. All my coworkers are deep into COVID fear 14 months later. This sub has helped me to not feel alone. It’s comforting to know there are others out there who also question what’s happening and who don’t want the shot. If nothing else, maybe this sub will also help you to not feel alone. I’m glad you’re here. 🤝</p>

        <p>Political parties are not really representative of politics, they are a uniparty, controlled opposition. Women tend to adopt the views of their peers for collective approval so you tend to find that if they are raised by democrats/republicans they will just maintain that affiliation. In fairness a lot of men do that also, but women being higher in trait agreeableness are more prone to such groupthink.</p>
<p>It is extraordinarily rare to find a female based enough to understand who is controlling the political parties, media, pharma and the entire ediface of the establishment.</p>

        <p>Realistically, a very large share of people on both sides of the political aisle have been dreadfully disinterested in protecting liberty whenever COVID is invoked as the rationale for its abrogation. Plenty of so-called conservatives haven't been any better than their leftist peers, something that becomes even more obviously true when you consider other Western nations like Canada.</p>
<p><em>That said,</em> particularly in the US, 100% of those politicians who have been reasonable have been Republican. And among the civilian populous, it is clear that a significant majority of those who take issue with prevailing COVID policy are conservatives.</p>

        <p>I just wish people would educate themselves on this "vaccine" it's not even a vaccine it's chemotherapy. Never in human history have they injected mRNA into humans. Who knows what the future holds for those blind enough to believe it's protecting them. As for the lockdown here in Tacoma I just try to spend as much time as I can in the forests. I try to avoid populated areas as best I can because they really are depressing, seeing all the sheep mask up. 
If history has taught us anything it is to not trust government and anything they say is good for you. 
Remember when they pushed:
Asbestos, Manhattan project, several meds that caused irreversible damage, did experiments on Natives here and in Alaska, when they poisoned whiskey barrels during prohibition, I could go on and on. The best course of action is read old history books and read different authors different point of views. Knowledge is power and protection.</p>

        <p>This is all very true and very important. The history doesn’t lie. There is clearly a pattern. My best friends (I wrote briefly about this in another comment on this thread) all agree and see the horrendous acts of those in power throughout the past, and say shit like “well I would have been the one to go against what everyone else says and not Hiel Hitler in the 30s and 40s” “I would have been able to stand up to this or that” yet when this same scandalous activity is taking place RIGHT NOW, in OUR TIMELINE, they can’t see past the wool that’s been pulled over there eyes. That’s how strong this mind melding really is. Even the most skeptical of people I’ve witnessed have fallen into it, just like all those in the past. It disturbs me. It makes me feel like I’m wrong, that all of this on r/nonewnormal is wrong and these are just crazy people. It’s that bad. Everyday I need to question my own beliefs. Is there really anything malicious going on? But the more I continue to research and the more I take in from every side of the political spectrum and from both sides of the opinions, my beliefs are unfortunately reassured again. My god what is going on</p>

        <p>Their so far gone. They don’t know what else to say. The science isn’t adding up with masks and prolonged lockdowns. So now their falling back on using buzz words like kill grandma and conspiracy theory and anti vax. My favorite is now their saying oh Florida and Texas are lying about the deaths when actually there’s way more evidence that death numbers  are over inflated. But I think it comes down to a subconscious of I can’t have been wrong for a whole year, I must be doing the right thing by getting the shot and following the rules. So let me lump people who don’t into “bad” aka trump people so I can feel better. Their so far gone it’s kinda hilarious at this point tbh</p>

People who think their getting informed by cnn. I don’t watch any cable news at all. I really wish people could understand that the battle is not red vs blue. The lockdowns have created the largest redistribution of wealth in the nations history. Our government passed a Covid stimulus and gave most of the money to foreign aid and big corporations. The same government and media who lied us into Iraq and lies about damn near everything is suddenly looking out of us? Please</p>

        <p>Here's one thing that might help. It saved my life! Someone told me about the No Agenda podcast last year. I have not missed a minute of it since last April. Adam Curry and John C Dvorak analyze the news twice a week, on Thursday and Sunday. Its 3 hours or longer.  For the last year the top subject has beens COVID. They present an alternative view. Main website is http://noagendashow.net
they have their own livestream. I usually listen to it live, but you can listen anytime. They have been doing this for 13 years. Adam is known as "the podfather", as he basically invented podcasting. Now working on "podcasting 2.0" to prevent censorship. There is a fun Youtube channel called Animated No Agenda. A listener animates a little 3 minute clip from each episode.  If you have been feeling like you are in the Twilight Zone, No Agenda is the cure for that. Its all quite serious, but they make the best of it, and have fun laughing at the insanity.</p>

        <p>PLEASE READ, OP, you’re not alone. </p>
<p>I can relate to this so much. Over the past few years I’ve surrounded myself with friend who share likeminded views. Views like skepticism of the govt and large institutions. We discuss ideas from the past like red taping, hitlers rise to power and how it was able to come about, lobbying, big pharmaceutical scandals, and more recently at the beginning of the pandemic skepticism towards it. I knew these guys used their heads. However, in the time of true crisis and real concern, they’ve all someone suddenly become exactly who theyve criticized for being stupid. I thought it was just media pressuring to take vaccines, stay in your home, etc. It doesn’t feel like reality.... all my most sceptical, anti-government, libertarian friends have switched sides just like that. 
When I asked my one friend why he wanted to take the vaccine when he himself was skeptic all his answer was “idk man” so I said it’s still very experimental and all that, to which he replied “well that’s what I’m here for, I’m okay with being an experiment.”...... I couldn’t believe it. Willing to be an experiment for a system that he very well knows cares nothing for him? Outrageous and very scary. 
You’re not alone in this. I feel like everyone who I knew I could trust has been whittled down, and it’s just me now. No one shares these ideas anymore. I genuinely don’t want there to be malicious hands at play here, and I don’t want to be the guy who says I told you so in the end but I think that’s what this is shaping up to be.</p>

        <p>We are all here because we want No New Normal. That is all. I'm not a Republican either and I'd say about 50% of the folks here are not (be they libertarians, people not even in the US, Democrats, etc.).</p>
<p>It will not be easy. All I can say to help is to buy Bitcoin. The world is burning down around us but hey, at least you can get rich off of them doing it.</p>

        <p>To be quite honest. You’re the future of the Republican Party. The democrats have gotten so far left and authoritarian these days the latinos left. For the remainder of this decade, center left will be looking for a new home and Republicans in competitive districts need to capitalize on this. This is why I finally swapped parties in 2020. While it was fun trolling my liberal friends for years on this, come 2022, I’ll be in town halls / primaries / meetings to get the GOP together back on track. I live in a majority-minority district in a red state. It’s time to take the district back with modern ideas. If the GOP adopted social liberalism, something most Millenials and gen z embrace, the Dems have no competitive advantage anymore.</p>

        <p>Hey I'm in a similar boat. I had mental health issues before covid but now they've gotten worse from isolation. My friends are too scared too meet up. Think I'm racist, selfish and inconsiderate because I don't agree with the new normal and honestly I'm on the edge of staying sane. </p>
<p>Covid hasn't helped my eating disorder. I'd stop wearing a mask if I didn't need my job. But I do. 
I'm just fatigued and disenfranchised. Everyone's so polarized and riled up one way or another. I just want to see my friends and have fun.</p>

        <p>The problem with progressives is that they treat everything like a nail that needs to be hammered by the government. They do not understand the violent implications of what it is they're actually doing. If you're willing to "force" people to do things through the government then you're basically saying that you're prepared to let the government ultimately kill you if you resist and follow every scenario of resistance to it's logical conclusion. This is why societies in the west were mainly based on Liberalism, ie: letting people live how they want, free markets, free speech, using the violence of government in the least amount of situations possible—because they figured out painstakingly through past experience that using the government to solve every problem simply leads to tyranny such as seen in Fascist Germany, various Communist/Socialist governments—and now in current Western governments I guess. </p>
<p>They label you as Republican because this is an easy way to discredit your views, even if they are not your views. Similar labels include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fascist</li>
<li>White Supremacist</li>
<li>Misogynist</li>
<li>Right Wing</li>
<li>Conspiracy Theorist</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>There are the words they use to label you and dismiss your argument. Once you have the label you can be easily identified and censored with no recourse and your objections ignored. Now you understand, perhaps you even contributed to the censorship in the past—this is what censorship gets you, what is acceptable opinion today isn't tomorrow and before you know it even the censors are being censored. Republican is simply the white supremacist of tomorrow.</p>
<p>I suggest you take a pragmatic approach to your new found enlightenment and use the time re-examine your core values and everything you hold to be true. If you were wrong about this, if the media and government institutions were all wrong, what else were they wrong about?</p>

        <p>Well Alberta just passed a law banning anti covid rallies. So that's fucked. I'm in Ontario and we're doing the worst in North American with the most draconian lockdowns. There's a huge rally in Toronto next weekend but you'll never see that on the news. Are local advocates are trying there hardest to go to court but the government has literally shut down the court systems unless it's to ban free speech. So basically were so fucked. I don't obey the mask bullshit or travel restrictions but every fucking store is closed.</p>

        <p>21-22 was one of the funnest ages of my life. I can’t imagine how that time would have been hampered if I couldn’t go out with friends to do regular stuff, and when we would be able to, we’d have to cover our faces with stupid masks. It makes me sad that they basically took this year away from you. </p>
<p>And the funny thing is, from a generation that has the least to lose from this virus, you guys have displayed the least resistance to just giving up your life to authority. No kind of rebellion from the youth in anyway. Every time I see someone not masking, calling this all bullshit, it’s 100% from older generation who have balls to do so. Your generation has been the most compliant. That’s when you know we’re fucked. Every other movement has started with youth rebellion but not this one.</p>

        <p>The one thing that the last year has shown me is that people from all sides of the political spectrum are against heavy-handed government intrusion in our lives. </p>
<p>I have started following people I would never have thought to follow because previously I viewed them as being on the wrong side of the fence. </p>
<p>It has opened my eyes, and broadened my horizons. We're all in this together, and the more of us who take notice of how nefarious forces will use any excuse to divide us, the stronger we will become.</p>

        <p>Several years ago I stopped believing in any political party, as well as stopped believing in the Left/Right paradigm. I feel we're all being played like pawns in a game, while those in power continue feeding off of our suffering and wealth.

        <p>The whole point was to save grandma but elderly people decline because they are lonely  </p>
<p>This pandemic has shown me just how selfish the elderly are. If I live to my 80's, I hope I would be willing to sacrifice my life for my grandchildren. A 15yr old who commits suicide is a much greater tragedy than 85yr old grandma who dies from Covid. &lt;&lt;&lt;This is the harsh truth that many refuse to accept. It seems like Canada does not give a flying fck about it's young people and children. Luckily, I happily live in the U.S..</p>

        <p>I’m going through a very similar situation. My mental health has been the worst it’s ever been the past year, I can’t even get proper help for it even if I wanted to. When will people understand that talking over the phone or on zoom is not an adequate replacement for real in-person medical help. My doctor has been prescribing me medications over the phone that I’ve been hesitant to take. I’m currently waiting for a specialist to see me, it won’t be until late July. I booked my appointment in February</p>
<p>I’m also waiting for two surgeries that I NEED to have done because not getting them is affecting my health and quality of life tremendously. I can’t even work right now because of it. But apparently all that matters now is covid. But yet I see no one actually getting sick from it, let alone dying. No one else with medical problems is important right now and it makes me so angry how we are being treated as less than</p>
<p>I had a complete breakdown a couple weeks ago and spent the night at the hospital. It was practically empty. I’ve never had to wait such little time at a hospital before to be seen. I recently just saw my doctor and was crying to her about how I couldn’t get the surgeries I needed and how badly it’s affecting me. She talked to me like an idiot, saying “the ICU’s are full.” I’m like WHERE?? I was just at the fucking hospital. I got so pissed at her and honestly I’ve lost my trust in her as well. I’ve been seeing her my whole life. She works from home now 90% of the time. What the fuck does she know? She’s never at the fucking hospital, she hasn’t worked at one for years</p>
<p>I feel like I can’t trust people anymore. I don’t even want to get help anymore sometimes because I feel like every medical “professional” is lying to me. I feel like I’m being gaslighted, because honestly I am. It makes me sick</p>
<p>I feel for you and everyone else who has to deal with medical issues right now. We are being treated as biohazards and it has to stop. This is only going to kill more people than covid ever has. So many people I know are having suicidal thoughts right now. Are their lives not important enough for treatment? I’m fucking sick and tired of these games everyone is playing. I never agreed to play</p>

        <p>My only hope is that government and politicians are dumb ass fuck compared to the entrepreneurs, lawyers and doctors(that aren't scared of losing funding). Are biggest push in Canada is to get Adolf Trudeau out of power and let the ethics courts have there way with them. The second one of these dominoes falls the rest will. But I can say for the first time In my life I'm ashamed to be Canadian.</p>

I want to think these fuckers have over exposed themselves. All of us "theorists" have known these evil fucks for years and years, but the masses just ran through the rat race ignoring the obvious because it's a hard pill to swallow.

        <p>&rt;I actually hold a lot of progressive views</p>
<p>This global experiment is progressivism at its best. Read John Dewey's The Social Possibilities of War. This was always the goal, omnipotent technocracy and a managed economy... It started with eugenics and scientific racism as its organizing morality, now it's "anti-racism" which curiously supports the same approach to managing the population size and character. Progressivism is American fascism with a temporary feigned tolerance for bohemianism, a veneer which has pretty much completely worn off already.</p>

        <p>Nope that’s bull shit and a talking point. Texas re opened and their fine. Florida has been open and their fine. And their don’t have mask mandates in a lot of places so if not wearing a mask or locking down is what spreads the virus than how are they not the two worse states in the country. Also people did Comply. They complied for two weeks than for a month than they lost their business or their mental health went to shit and they stopped watching the news and realized the lockdowns after about a month were doing more harm than good. The biggest lie being told is people don’t comply.</p>

        <p>no it's not bull and you know it, I am not saying that didn't happen. The lockdown DID get pushed longer and longer no arguments here. But what did it was people ignoring lockdown and spreading the virus, it's been happening all year you can find reports of people protesting the lockdown and outright ignoring it all throughout last year. People didn't comply they ignored it.</p>

        <p>yes they have been open for months, after the lockdown helped quash much of the spread. It will take time but soon, likely by about september to october and their rates will skyrocket. A couple weeks to a month after ending lockdown is not a good way to get statistics. wait and see.</p>

        <p>wow, that was quite rude, can't even combat a logical argument with something logical yourself you stoop to degrading and demeaning me. I truly hope what I predicted doesn't come true, I do but as you call me a Doomer or as I call it a realist. I truly believe that here in a few months those area will be heavily infected with the pandemic. Knowing how things like this happen I expect a sharp rise in reported cases around september to october.</p>

        <p>yes, obeying. to follow orders. Sometimes even free people need to follow them if they want to live. If you are told to evacuate the coast cause a storm is going to destroy it and kill everyone there. Do you evacuate or do you bunker down and try to outlast something that's supposed to destroy everything in your area? Sometimes, believe it or not some orders are for your own good.

        <p>The lockdowns are affecting people negatively, I don’t know a single person who’s ever suggested otherwise. Losing half your family also tends to have a negative effect, so overwhelming our hospitals at the outset of this whole mess wouldn’t have been any better. If people had taken this seriously from the start, we could have taken a slowed down approach with restrictions instead of outright lockdowns. If people could wash their damn hands, we might have gotten away with masks and six feet. You wouldn’t believe how many people I see leave bathrooms without so much as rinsing.</p>
<p>I don’t watch CNN and couldn’t possibly give a fuck less what they tell anyone to say. You probably got that impression from FOX.</p>
<p>The reason healthy people need the vaccine is to create a hostile environment for the disease. If it can’t easily find vulnerable hosts it will starve itself out before it can mutate further. Otherwise we could end up with new versions that resist drugs, cause even worse long term health effects, ignore the existing vaccines in people who did get them, spread even faster or in more ways, last longer and be more miserable... We need to get to a certain percentage of people vaccinated in every area, so it has no new hosts to spread to. It’s really not that difficult to explain, or to understand, if you actually want to know instead of just wanting to dislike it.</p>

        <p>Prove it. The vaccine has gone through trial phases, not the full course we usually use to identify long term health risks you are absolutely correct, but more than enough to show that it helps prevent the spread of the virus. If you disagree with their studies, feel free to provide citation or evidence.</p>

<p>Like it or not, if you want the old normal back we need to fight this virus with the intent to win. Half assing it will only lead to three more experimental vaccines to fight the next group of mutated strains. Half assing that will keep it going even further. We either get it done, or we accept that this is going to always be here. If you really like this whole new normal bullshit we have going on, by all means keep pushing people away from solutions.</p>

        <p>We are still learning how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19. Until we know more about how vaccines will affect the spread of COVID-19, people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 should keep taking precautions in public places like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and washing your hands often.</p>
<p>Based on what we know about vaccines for other diseases and early data from clinical trials, experts believe that getting a COVID-19 vaccine also helps keep you from getting seriously ill even if you do get COVID-19.</p>
<p>Early data show the vaccines do help keep people with no symptoms from spreading COVID-19, but we are learning more as more people get vaccinated</p>
<p>all from the cdc. Go ahead and get the experimental drug if you wish. But don’t expect healthy people to get it. No need at all.</p>

        <p>Just gave you a ton of reasons, and they give those answers for legal reasons. Unless you seriously think (conspiracy theorist level semi-brain dead think) that we made the vaccines knowing they didn’t do anything, the obvious conclusion is that they are made to stop the virus from spreading.</p>
<p>Vaccines teach your body how to fight an invader. They can’t “guarantee” anything, none of them have ever been able to do that. They don’t make you “immune” to the virus - they make it so you can fight off smaller batches of it easier. If you have little to no immune system, there’s nothing for the vaccine to teach. If you get a huge dose of viral load all at once, the training might not be enough for your immune system to win against the sudden overwhelming flood. Since vaccines can’t guarantee anything, “wait and see” is the only answer we can legally get that doesn’t open them up to insane lawsuits from people saying “I don’t care that it mutated into a new strain the vaccine doesn’t cover, you said it would make this go away!” and “What do you mean my mother with AIDS couldn’t benefit from the vaccine? You said it made people safe!”</p>
<p>Of course they won’t say anything solid, they’d have to be dumber than a box of rocks to do so no matter how confident they are in the vaccine.</p>
<p>This is all really easy stuff, you’re just choosing not to follow the answers.</p>

        <p>Dude I got no problem getting vaccinated. I get my shots. What I have a problem with is this push  for not even a vaccine but a drug that’s not even FDA approved. Suddenly your anti vax or harming others by electing not to get it and that’s gotta stop. It a narrative that’s Total bull shit.</p>

        <p>60% vaccinated, 60% of those are with the Chinese vaccine that we’ve already more or less ruled out as not worth the trouble, and the ones getting sick are the ones without finished vaccine courses. I’d say that’s a lot more to do with idiots thinking it’s all over and they can go back to normal rather than anything to do with the vaccine.</p>

        <p>&rt; If people had taken this seriously from the start, we could have taken a slowed down approach with restrictions instead of outright lockdowns.</p>
<p>So why, when Quebec's hospitalization rate has dropped considerably, are they on month four of a four week curfew designed to slow the spread? The plainly observable fact is that COVID has been the basis for a government power grab, and no behavior by the people will convince the tyrants to stop terrorizing them. That you're stupid enough to still believe all of this is being done in good faith over a year after this began says quite a bit about you, none of it good.</p>

        <p>Oh please, a government power grab by every nation on the damn planet at the same time without anyone whistleblowing it? You couldn’t name a bigger conspiracy without involving aliens, and what’s worse is that if this really is some big play what in the flying fuck do you think you’re going to do about it? Do you think not wearing a mask or not getting a shot is going to somehow make it all better if every government on the globe has agreed to screw us all?</p>
