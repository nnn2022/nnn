    <strong>Feel so alone, everyone here has gotten the vaxx</strong>
    <p><p>I am scared because another Covid disciple who I thought would wake up [unless they lied] bragged of getting the vaxx to my husband. I convinced my husband of the dangers of the vaxx, it took some work, but showed him enough links, but it's not helping all these people going to brag to him.  This person had a close relative get sick from the vaxx, really sick and STILL LINED UP. I burst out in tears, because I could not understand this. He doesn't understand why I am so emotional. He is not a 'conspiracy' person like me but admits there is a kleptocracy. I think he believes this is all going to be over soon anyhow, and things will return to "normal". I don't want others putting pressure on him. He's still fine "waiting" but I am so creeped out. </p>
<p>Another person too in a group [I believe got the vaxx] and ended up with loss of motor control, and serious side effects, I was upset about what happened to them. This is someone who is young too, I was in shock. I hope they will be okay.</p>
<p>I cried to husband and said, why are people lining up for something harming them. Something is very wrong. </p>
<p>How can I live in a town with no independent thinkers?</p></p>

        <p>I think we may have to lie if asked in future. I told 3 people health reasons are keeping me from it. Told all three don't tell anyone and don't think they have. Tried to warn a few long distance online friends in other communities but they are spread out and no one listened. But I could fake a "mind change". I don't feel much like hanging out with people anymore. Have to par se every word. So tired of it. I am okay at Zoom structured activities and groups, that's fine, but any free talk. Just too hard right now.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's easy to backtrack on. I am not meeting up with people even as things open up, [there's no unvaxxed here to meet up with or free thinkers] because I don't want to be asked or pressured. I fear the spike proteins too, and other side effects--don't know if that's a problem or not, but waiting things out. I want to see fall come and go and make sure Covid 21 won't be a reality. I am not telling anyone I am anti Covid vax now and keeping silent about it.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, you own your health choices and nobody can take that away from you. If you don't feel comfortable with a procedure, you are free to decline. This is basic shit and I don't know how we've been so manipulated to think what's happening is not a violation of our   basic right to medical autonomy. </p>
<p>Your husband is also free to make his own choices, but seeing as you're his partner, I think your input on the matter should mean a lot to him when making his decision. </p>
<p>If it makes you feel any better, nearly everyone around me in my life is vaccinated. I'm lucky because all but one in my immediate family remain COVID-unvaccinated and have no plans to. But work, friends, extended family â€“ I am in a sea of "did you get the vaccine yet?" and I know the feeling you're describing too well, the majority of us here on this sub do as well.</p>
<p>Just hang in there and don't stand for people who openly shame you or your husband for exercising your autonomy, if they truly cared about public health they would respect your decision, all they care about is conformity.</p>

        <p>Thanks you, yes I will hold on to my own medical autonomy. In my case, my chances of death from the vaxx are very high. I am glad to hear most of your family is unvaccinated. I am no contact from abusive family but they were system lovers and I am sure probably all lined up.  Yeah we have been in a sea of being asked. We usually avoid the question or circumvent it. Maybe the isolation is a good thing. I don't want to face dinner party or extended pressure.</p>

        <p>You are not alone, if statistics are correct, which we can't really trust anyways, there is about 40% of people who didn't get the vaccine. And if they didn't get it yet, is because they don't want it. I discovered that making fun of it helps break the ice and disarm people. If you are too serious about it they will think you are nuts. Don't go around advertising you didn't get it, but when asked don't lie. Just say you are not getting it for now and is waiting a little longer for the results of the trials to reconsider it.</p>

        <p>I would say the percentage here is 5 percent, maybe 30 in a predominantly African American area but I am sure there's got to be places where 40 percent said no. I know they are not telling us the true numbers. That's a good idea to make a joke about it. Should look some up. Yeah I come across as too serious. Even to make it in life, have to hide all these feelings. Yeah I am keeping mouth shut. We have done the "we are trying to choose which one" blah blah blah. putting people off.</p>
