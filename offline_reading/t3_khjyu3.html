        <p>Have to agree with this man. People are literally reaching the end of their ropes and when that happens? Violence follows. I don't condone it. I don't like it. But that is the historical precedent here.</p>

        <p>There was a time when I agreed with you, but if the government is killing people by taking freedoms away, violence probably becomes the best answer.  Those currently in power, and those who will come to power in the coming decades, must be taught they lead only with our permission, and when they fail this intentionally and egregiously, there are consequences.</p>

        <p>The problem is that the violence will likely be directed at each other, then at the police when they get involved. Then they'll call in the military for martial law. I wouldn't doubt that this is a part of the "grand plan" right now, thus why the stimulus checks are a small amount. As much as I believe the people wield the power to stop this, I also know people are not very smart when it comes to who to blame.</p>

        <p>The point about the cheques is interesting. The amounts make it obvious what the intent is:</p>
<p>- It's not enough to support a middle-class household and a family. Those people will be forced to slowly forced to sell off all of their assets until they have nothing and are completely dependent on government largesse.</p>
<p>- It's enough to keep the layabouts in Doritos, booze, weed, and video games while they sit at home and do nothing - especially if they share an apartment. It's like getting to live the "frat house" lifestyle forever, for free! In Canada, two room mates like this would, together, pull in <em>4 grand a month</em> on CERB. Care to guess who they will vote for next time around?</p>

        <p>I agree and disagree. I think martial law is part of the bigger agenda like you stated and that the violence will inevitably be directed towards each other. However, when we observe who precisely is being irrational and blaming the wrong people, it's the COVID cultists. They are the ones with a radical mentality wishing and supporting death, abuse and imprisonment on those who do not align with the narrative and who could care less about the devastation and the lives that will be lost in the wake of the pandemic. It's ironic because these people are so unstable that although they fear the dreaded virus, they will be the ones to stand between the rebellion and the source willing to kill their people and die doing so just to sustain a simple insane belief of a pandemic that does not exist, well except for one of the mind that is.</p>
<p>If you have noticed, it is the westernized nations that are currently under attack and where the mass campaign to subjugate the people are happening. They are the nations that possess a perception of freedom and it needs to be eradicated. If you look at Asian countries, they seem to be doing just fine and although they would have the people believe that this becasue of some non existent measures and masking that occurred, bar a few days, perhaps a couple weeks, it is really because there is no need to subjugate ac society that has already been subjugated. They already accept that they have no rights, only privilege's, privilege's that can be usurped at any given moment. It's their way of life.</p>
<p>I've been saying that the citizens of the US are the last people standing in this battle. They are literally the only westernized country that has the weapons and resources to mount a defense. I'm not a big fan of the US, but facts are facts, and if they fall, the rest of the world will crumble like a house of cards. </p>
<p>I also think that martial law is a tricky situation for the US. It's one thing to bring in a bunch of National Guard brainwashed drones, but to hand over power to the military complex could be risky. Once you bring the military into their homeland and task them with basically killing their family and friends, it would only take one high ranking General to form a coup and take over the country and government. Now you have a situation that is unpredictable and could go either way. Although the US military  has it's degree of indoctrination and brainwashing, they aren't nearly as assimilated as the Chinese military where in all likelihood they would shoot their grandmother if ordered to.</p>
<p>There's only a few knowns and the rest is speculation.</p>
<p>Knowns:</p>
<p>- This pandemic is the biggest hoax the world has ever seen (all the data irrefutably supports this)</p>
<p>- It is the Westernized countries being targeted (this is more than obvious)</p>
<p>- They have used this pandemic to create the biggest divide in the people since the civil war</p>
<p>- We've seen one of the greatest wealth transfers in history - Wealth equals power plus control - however is tis just a matter of positioning people? I have a feeling that once all the cards are laid out, money will have little significance in the new world, but this itself is only speculation. </p>
<p>Speculation:</p>
<p>- Depopulation Agenda - Seems very apparent</p>
<p>- Vaccine - What the real agenda behind this carries a number of prospective motives</p>
<p>- One World Authoritarian Government most likely</p>
<p>- The US is the primary target - Again this is highly probable</p>
<p>- Attack on our immune systems - This is one of my theories and there is a plethora of evidence to demonstrate this and could play a significant role in conjunction with the depopulation and vaccines agendas</p>
<p>Bottom line is and the unfortunate truth is that we are amid a war right now and people are dying and are going to die despite guns being fired, so do we die from starvation, mental and physical health degradation, substance abuse, executions for non compliance (this isn't far fetched is you look at the direction of the current policing)? Or do we die, like our forefathers did, sacrificing our lives to preserve our basic freedoms of humanity so that our children can live and breathe in a free world.</p>
