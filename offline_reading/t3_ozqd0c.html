        <p>I hope enough ppl wake up to the shenanigans that government, "elites" and special interest groups are up to soon. Amazing to me how many have flip flopped from "power to the people" to "trust the government", not realizing that they are just pawns/minions for these "elites" who seek to bring in the new world order. As far as a nonviolent solution goes, I'm not sure what to think. When people stand up and protest they are demonized and being labeled as supremacists, terrorist ECT, and become fearful of losing their social status, job, family and friends. If we allow ourselves to keep being backed into a corner then violence or surrender will become our only 2 options. If things become violent then I believe our government will implement a true martial law thus gaining full control over We The People and sparking a CW 2.0. I truly believe we are dangerously close to this point with forced medical tyranny. I don't think their manufacturered race war is working as they had hope causing US to turn on each other then implementing martial law. What is happening is huge and bigger then just US, this is happening all over the world in almost every country. Millions are trying to stand up non violently against this New World Order style oppression that we are seeing. The only thing that separates US from most other countries is that we still have our firearms and a means to keep the wolves at bay. I look for violence to increase even more then we've seen with some states implementing their jab mandates. Many who haven't had the stab or are not getting it will become desperate because they won't be allowed to work, buy groceries, go the doctors ect. Desperate ppl with nothing to lose are the most dangerous. I'm afraid this is their game that we are all involved in right now and on the surface it seems they are winning. I don't think they are though. We are seeing them lose confidence amongst their sheep now that the stabbed are being forced to wear mask and now many know the jab really isn't helping, so for now we should let their shit show implode and welcome people out of the "dark side" as they wake up. If the unthinkable has to happen again, well I guess we will just have to take our country back or die trying. Freedom is the hill I am prepared to die on, power is their hill and with power comes greed, with greed comes implosion. Let's hope they implode before good people are forced to make bad decisions! Just my humble opinions!  Sorry for the rant! Stay safe! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²</p>

        <p>Iâ€™d love to see Vaccine mandates nationwide.  Thatâ€™ll be the breaking point of our country for sure.  </p>
<p>Theyâ€™re crossing crazy lines now. </p>
<p>Youâ€™ll see an uprising like no other.</p>

        <p>Discrimination against people who choose to not be vaccinated is fascism. If the data was clear, and the virus was deadly, I could understand. But this is a coordinated attack on people who simply reject the bullshit and think critically (also 'coincidentally' the same people who oppose much of the crap governments and companies do). It is like if they mandated smoking in the 1940s, propaganda and science are just as in line as then, except now they are tied even more to globalism and dark money.</p>

        <p>If they keep pushing it, if they really convince companies to require it for fire for some nice virtue signaling, if they don't allow folks to feed their families unless they get the vaccine, there will be absolutely no non violent solution out if this.</p>
<p>They're playing with goddamn fire. They think we're all just going to give in and roll over...and some people will, but a large many will not. The shocker to them is there's even a population of <em>vaccinated</em> folks that are going to fight with us because they are into being lab rats, not forcing others to starve or taking children away from those deemed lesser.. and believe, they <em>will</em> begin trying to physically steal our children to re-educate and adopt them off to "better society".. they can't grow their numbers without them.
They will also have military and LEO turn on them. Do they just not account for that or ?</p>
<p>They've held back because we're a heavily armed country but they aren't stopping.</p>

        <p>In my opinion, no. If they were to send someone to my house and physically attempt to force me, the minecraft server I live in would become a very treacherous place for all involved.</p>

&rt;<br>
&rt;It's time to make a stand, honey<br>
No clots-shot going in my body<br>
Laughin', but the joke's notâ€…funnyâ€…at all<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And itâ€…took me five whole minutes<br>
To tell the government to shove it<br>
Holdin' all this anger pumps cortisol<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I think I've seen this film before<br>
And I didn't like the ending<br>
This is not my homeland anymore <br>
So what am I defending now? <br>
Social distancing from town<br>
Now I'm in exile waiting Covid out <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;I think I've seen this film before<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;No mRNA vaccine for me, honey<br>
No long-term safety studies<br>
Like you want me to get a heart injury<br>
Second, third, and hundredth boosters<br>
Another round of sheltering in place<br>
Those lies add insult to injury  </p>
<p>&rt;<br>
&rt;I think I've seen this film before<br>
And I didn't like the ending<br>
This is not a small problem anymore <br>
So who am I offending now?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;You know Biden is a senile clown<br>
Now I'm in exile to a FEMA campout?<br>
I think I've seen this film before<br>
So I'm leavin' out the side door<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So no vaccine I shout, there is no amount <br>
Of dying I'm gonna do for you <br>
All this time, listening to liberals whine<br>
They won't even hear us out<br>
There are so many warning signs (So many signs)<br>
It's hard to change a brain-washed mind<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Is it too late to turn things around? (So many signs)<br>
Please see the warning signs (So many signs)<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So many signs...</p>
