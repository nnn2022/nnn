        <p>interestingly‚Ä¶ i got the flu shot every single year up until i turned 20. usually about a month after, i‚Äôd come down with an upper respiratory infection of some kind and i‚Äôd be sick for weeks (my body has never handled colds well, not sure why that is. i can handle a stomach bug and recover in 2 days just fine‚Äî but colds and whatnot were always so horrible for me) </p>
<p>now i‚Äôm 24, haven‚Äôt gotten a flu vaccine in 4 years and guess what? not a single upper respiratory infection. not ONE in 4 years. not a cold, not a flu, not bronchitis. and this is after years of me suffering sometimes for even months after the illness. </p>
<p>i can‚Äôt speak to other people‚Äôs experiences or the reasoning behind this, but i kind of do find it odd that once i stopped getting vaccinated i stopped getting sick. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</p>

        <p>The first sentence alone is flat out wrong. There ARE many adverse reactions. But thats just it, deep down these people don't care if thousands have severe reactions. To them, they are expendable for the "greater good" of "defeating" covid. Thats what it boils down to. These people are willing to have the others DIE or be permanently damaged if that meant they get to say the beat covid via vaccines. Ask one of these people to give you a number at which the adverse reactions are too many for them. They can't because it'll be high. Its actually a reality of life and I wouldn't mind if they honestly said "yeah id be cool with 10k dying from the vax if that meant everyone else would be okay". But these are the same who wanted to shutdown your business and embraced stripping away freedoms because "1 positive covid case was too many". Hypocrites.</p>
