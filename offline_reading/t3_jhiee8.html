        <p>No, I mean it... whether it's ok or not ok to enforce a protocol is basically up to whether it does anything. In this case "it might possibly do something... and we gotta do at least something!"... isn't it?</p>
<p>And the real kicker is... the authorities quickly threw together a couple of measures, which suck (in our opinion). Instead of improving they are spending looots of money on convincing people that no, these original measures are perfect and we have to stick with them. Because they don't make mistakes apparently.</p>

        <p>If they're at the point where a harmless disease like covid is an actual threat to their life, then they were about to die of anything else anyway. What I'd do at that point is try to make use of the precious time we have together, which isn't much with or without covid, and spend time together.</p>
<p>And regardless of what me and this hypothetical person would choose to do given this situation, that's still none of the government's business.</p>

        <p>I don't know all the details of my friends' medical history or what conditions they might have that they have not told me about. That is, of course, their private business unless they choose to share it with me. So I consider that if they make the choice to hang out with me, then that means that they have made an informed decision that the risk to themselves is low enough that they can accept it in exchange for the benefits that they get from socializing. It's the same the other way around: equipped with the knowledge of my own medical situation and the level of risk that is acceptable to me, I make the choice to see those friends. We're all well under 70 and nowhere near 300 lbs, after all.  </p>
<p>I do have friends who refuse to see me indoors, because they're planning on visiting their elderly parents later and things like that. I respect whatever choice they make according to their own circumstances, no questions asked, and am not going to make a muss about it or try to bully them into socializing indoors.</p>

        <p>Yes, a few old and very disabled people dies. It's sad off course. But blaming people doesn't help anyone or bettering the situation. It's nones fault other than the virus itself if bad things happens. To most the virus isn't dangerous. To just a tiny minority it's.</p>
<p>I don't think a lockdown is the solution because of mental health, businesses, poverty, delayed medical services, education and children's lives.</p>

        <p>because i am a logical, scientific type of person who isnt easily emotionally swayed/manipulated. i trust scientific evidence over rumors and the scientific evidence is not saying that lockdowns are working .</p>
<p>https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30208-X/fulltext</p>
<p>TAU did a study earlier, its peer reviewed and they too found no correlation between lockdowns and deaths . even including lack of lockdown completely.</p>
<p>https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/social-distancing-more-important-than-lockdowns-in-covid-19-fight-tau-644754</p>
<p>repeating the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is definition of insanity.</p>
<p>virus is gonna virus no matter what. obviously if i am sick i will avoid others but everything in life has risks, lots of people unknowingly carry meningitis in their nose. i could of killed someone just by breathing in their direction &amp; i would of never known .. .&amp; meningitis when it is symptomatic has a very high death rate, around 20 percent . COVID's median death rate is 0.23% or lower.</p>
<p>this virus disproportionately is killing 80+ year olds with cancer, heart disease, diabetes,  etc.. it isnt like swine flu or spanish flu which mostly killed young healthy people...</p>

        <p>That's how viruses work. We all pass them to people. It's part of being human. I don't blame whoever gave me swine flu just like I don't blame whoever gave me Covid. It happens.</p>
<p>None of this helps but in fact kicks the c an down the road while in turn creating a far worse off environment of poverty, unemployment, starvation, mental health issues, suicide, lack of healthcare and restrictions of civil liberties.</p>
