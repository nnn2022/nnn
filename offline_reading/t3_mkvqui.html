    <strong>my oppinion is .. vaccines are no charity but giving land back would be helpful reparation of our european ancestors colonial wrongdoings</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/pope-francis-coronavirus-easter-message-d9a0aad8-599c-4bfa-b44c-4b998f458bc9.html">https://www.axios.com/pope-francis-coronavirus-easter-message-d9a0aad8-599c-4bfa-b44c-4b998f458bc9.html</a></p>
<p>from my viewpoint ... such a support of vaccines ...  is about the same stuff other popes did around 500 years ago with issuing the papal bulls what supported the domination of non-christian people</p>
<p>----<br>
<a href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/newcomb-the-holy-sees-response-misses-the-point">https://indiancountrytoday.com/archive/newcomb-the-holy-sees-response-misses-the-point</a><br>
"The Holy See issued numerous documents that called for the domination of free and independent indigenous nations and peoples. To this day it has never explicitly disavowed and revoked that framework of domination. The dominating mindset and interpretive framework expressed in those Vatican documents has been institutionalized in the world for more than five centuries."<br>
-----<br>
<a href="https://originalfreenations.com/about/">https://originalfreenations.com/about/</a><br>
"In May 2016, Mr. Newcomb recently met Pope Francis at St. Peter’s Square and spent two hours meeting with Archbishop Tomasi at the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace regarding the papal bulls of the fifteenth century."</p>

"Indigenous activist urges the Vatican to revoke 500-year-old documents: These papal bulls granted Christians “right of domination” over Indigenous peoples, says Steven Newcomb"<br>
--------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>again I would like to repeat ...it is my personal viewpoint, my own oppinion ...</p>
<p>that there is a mental connection between the two attitudes ... the support of colonialisation of indigenous peoples lands, the domination of non-christian people via papal bulls 500 years ago ... and todays support of the vaccines as a sort of charity ... as if it would be a help</p>
<p>while .. again ... seen from my viewpoint ...</p>
<p>a vaccine is not a help but is weakening a human being by conditioning it to depend on the chemical / pharmaceutical stuff</p>
<p>in the very same way like refined sugar is weakening the human system ...</p>
<p>mind, feelings as well as the body ...its creating an addictive behaviour</p>
<p>so I am jumping here a bit from one thing to the others ... the connections between the arguments a bit loose ... my mind at this moment not as clear as I would like to ...</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>what I would like to point towards is ...  that <strong>a true help for poor people would be if they would get some land back what has been stolen from their ancestors by european people</strong> .. by the european feudal empires which got the blessings of the popes to do so</p>

"The land we all live on should not be the sole property of a few. "</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>if for example everyone human being on the planet would receive enough land to build a house for itself on it and plant some vegetables for itself to nurture itself with a vegan diet ...  for example 1000 m2 given to everyone tax-free, rent-free, without any fee to be paid ... a free of cost lease for a lifetime  given this land to the individual via the local community, the smallest existing political territorial entity today, the village, the town, the city-district ...</p>
<p>the local sovereign community what would in an optimistic future scenario inherit a share of the regional state and nation state material and financial wealth</p>
<p>the local community receiving its sovereignty for example via a renewal of regional state constitution and a renewal of the nation state constitution</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>using eventually concepts like</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>----<br>
the local community, the village, the town, the city-district is its own absolute political sovereign. it receives/inherits all political decision powers from both the regional state as well as from the nation state</p>
<p>the local sovereign community creates, maintains and interpretes the local law, a set of rules what all inhabitants living here and now, permanent residents, are agreeing upon in an every resident including manner. this local law replaces all laws previously made on both regional state level as well as on nation state level</p>
<p>all local sovereign communities receive/inherit a share of the financial and material wealth of both the regional state as well as of the nation state, the size of the share corresponding to the number of communal residents</p>
<p>every local sovereign community at all times is able without conditions to leave/quit/exit both the regional state as well as the nation state<br>
----</p>
<p>I guess it could be a sort of ... global approach to land back ...  using public financial and material wealth to enable local sovereign communities buy enough land back so they could distribute it evenly to everyone  as a lifelong free of cost lease ... to give it to everyone who does not have access to land allready for example</p>
<p>I believe such a holistic approach to enable every human being on the planet to become self-sustaining via planting its own food and getting healthy by touching the earth ... the very microbes in the earth ... the very grounding itself in gardening routines ... makes happy and healthy</p>
<p>----------<br>

"The digging stirs up microbes in the soil. Inhaling these microbes can stimulate serotonin production, which can make you feel relaxed and happier<br>
.---------</p>
<p>so what I am saying here ...  <strong>I do not think that these chemical cocktails in a syringe are any charitable help</strong> ... they do nothing to undo the bad what colonisation has caused</p>
<p>what could really help would be for people who own more than they need to give land back to people who own less than they need</p>
<p>voluntarily</p>
<p>in 2017 I have written about this within my half fantasy novel half autobiographical reality criticism long text ... ascende perma and the membranes ... in these two chapters</p>

<p>it did actually happen a few times allready  ... people with european ancestry giving land back to indigenous people ... voluntarily</p>

<p>giving land back to people who are poor because their ancestors have been robbed of their lands, have been enslaved by the european feudal empires expansation</p>
<p>would allow people who are vulnerable because of malnutrition ... because they are poor they can not afford to buy enough fresh healthy food ... because our european ancestors have stolen their ancestors land ... they are poor today because our ancestors have stolen their ancestors land during 500 years of colonisation  and a free of cost injection with some chemicals will not do anything to repair it</p>
<p>oh I slipped again here ...</p>
<p>if the people today who own more than they need would voluntarily give land back to those who are poor today because their ancestors land has been stolen by european colonisation drives</p>
<p><strong>poor people would perhaps not want to ask for vaccines but would prefer to receive some true reparations by land being given back to them so they could get healthy the sustainable way ... by growing some sweet fruits in their own garden and enjoy them instead of the refined sugars</strong> what the chemical industry offers them in masses (so that they get sick enough to want the vaccines made by the chemical industry daughter the pharmaceutical industry ? .... )</p></p>

        <p>I have calculated about a 1000 square meters for one person to be a decent amount of land allowing self-sustaining production of vegetables and some heating materials in form of hemp</p>
<hr>
<p>1000 square meters
of which 50 to 100 square meters could be used to build a house/hut and a storage space for food and heating materials ... hempstalks, collected fallwood from the nearby forests
350 square meters for vegetable gardening
50 square meters for paths
and 500 square meters for hemp cultivattion</p>

        <p>If you have solid calculations, I'd like to go over them. Your numbers look off by simple inspection because they are unusually 'round.' As I said, if you'd like someone who looks at large data sets and development projects for a living to go over your numbers, don't hesitate to message me. It's past 2 am and I am off to bed.</p>

<p>https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vegan-defiencies</p>
<p>Remember, there are hundreds of millions of people who live nomadic lives on land that is hostile to agriculture. Should they starve because they are 'enslaving' animals and 'stealing' their byproducts? I know that you think that humans are animals and have the same worth as animals, but that kind of thinking always leads to genocide. ALWAYS.</p>

        <p>I believe that the most important part of any reparation for past wrongdoings is the acknowledgment of the wrongdoing ... the descendant of a human being who has enriched itself upon the suffering of an other human being ... acknowledging that one sees the error in ones ancestors doing</p>
<p>on such a ground ... voluntary not pressured acknowledging of past wrongdoings ... any material reparation like giving land back to descendants of past victims ... too would best come all voluntary and not pressured</p>
<p>that is how in my proposal of possible constitutional renewals there is one of four parts ... the third part ... what describes how the local sovereign community could receive/inherit a fair share of the regional state and nation state financial and material possessions, the share s size calculated according to the numbers of permanent residents of this local community</p>
<p>these material and financial inheritances then could possibly be used ... if the full assembly of all permanent residents of a local sovereign community would want to use them for such a purpose ... to offer private farmers / forest owners to transfer their land titles into the stewardship of the local sovereign community ... and if the private owners of agricultural land / forest would be interested to "sell" it to the local sovereign community ... they could be offered some compensation possible normal market value for the land / forest</p>
<p>I do think its most important to strive for renewals what are carried by most everyone involved </p>
