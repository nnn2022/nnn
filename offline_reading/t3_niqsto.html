    <strong>My future MIL, who hates me and doesn’t ever want grandkids....wants me to get the vaccine</strong>
    <p><p>So, my future MIL wants me to get the vaccine. </p>
<p>This same woman is overjoyed her morbidly obese, tattooed, feminist daughter is a lesbian and seems to try to make her youngest son like girly things, dressing him in skinny jeans and dying his hair. </p>
<p>She also forced both of them to get the vaxx. Her son is freshly 14 and her daughter is freshly 18. </p>
<p>MIL is also a divorced, obese, tattooed with danger hair. She’s a hypochondriac that eats McDonald’s Uber eats everyday and doesn’t go outside. Shes openly said she never wants to be called grandma. All of the family are Democrats, and thought trump was literally the devil. </p>
<p>I was told by her mother (my future MIL didn’t even have the guts to tell me herself) that she wanted me to get the vaccine and that I should get it because it’s my workplace. </p>
<p>I’m gonna pass. I was gonna pass already but it can’t be good a woman who was overjoyed her daughter is gay because it means no grandkids wants me to get the vaxx.</p></p>
