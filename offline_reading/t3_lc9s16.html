    <strong>Church following rules</strong>
    <p><p>My church shut down. I thought that undermined their whole message, namely, who is your god? (God or government)</p>
<p>Now it has re-opened. They're following all government protocols.  Recording attendees, spaced out, in masks, no snacks.</p>
<p>So I haven't attended. I told them, "it doesn't sounds like church." Basically attending seems like submission. And not attending seems my only way to encourage the church to return to normal.</p>
<p>But my church members are contacting me, asking if I've lost faith! Exactly opposite: I feel like I am the only ones in the church with faith, they all don't!</p>
<p>Anyways, I wonder if you're religious, and how you feel about your church/synagogue/mosque?</p></p>
