    <strong>Stop being blackpilled [Whitepill thread]</strong>
    <p><p>I know these times really fucking suck but being blackpilled accomplishes absolutely nothing. We need to resist, at least this gives us a righteous battle and we're on the right side of history. You have to remember that despite the constant mainstream media fear porn bombardment there are a huge amount of people that don't buy this garbage and are willing to resist. Even if just 10% of a people in a nation stand up against government tyranny you can have a revolution. This is not just rhetoric, it is the truth, and every single day awareness is spreading.</p>
<p>I would like this thread to be a white pill general where we post good news in the fight against this scamdemic. First of all check out this video:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQYzb5_kax8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQYzb5_kax8</a></p>
<p>Here we have Dr. Reiner Fuellmich. He's filing cases against this bullshit in Germany and he's going to blow the whole narrative apart. I think he has a super strong case. From what he's said it appears a worldwide coalition is forming and many court cases are coming, possibly culminating in a class action lawsuit. If it goes to the Supreme Court, they recently sided with NY worshippers and prevented further covid restrictions:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/26/supreme-court-religion-covid-barrett-440808">https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/26/supreme-court-religion-covid-barrett-440808</a></p>
<p>It's really not easy to enslave the world and resistance is only going to build. The greater the measures that are imposed, the greater people will pushback. Even if they try to boil the frog slowly there will always be limits to what they can do. If Fuellmich is successful the entire operation is going to fall apart like a house of cards at the global level. We need to support this man any way we can.</p>
<p>More whitepills:</p>
<p>- New York Sheriffs refuse to enforce Cuomo's Thanksgiving Orders:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8957801/New-York-State-sheriffs-refuse-enforce-Cuomos-Thanksgiving-executive-order.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8957801/New-York-State-sheriffs-refuse-enforce-Cuomos-Thanksgiving-executive-order.html</a></p>
<p>- They were not able to extend their "hard" lockdown here in the UK past December 3rd. This is directly as a consequence to the public resistance that has been building. Yes, we exit into harsher tier structures than before, and sadly the hospitality sector is pretty much locked down just as before, but overall momentum continues to build in our direction. More of Boris' own MPs are asking for evidence of the benefits of lockdown:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8974691/Show-worth-Boris-Johnson-faces-new-coronavirus-rebellion-70-anti-tier-Tory-MPs.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8974691/Show-worth-Boris-Johnson-faces-new-coronavirus-rebellion-70-anti-tier-Tory-MPs.html</a></p>
<p>- In Denmark, the vaccine was going to be compulsory for certain age groups, but after mass protest the government was forced to rescind on its position:</p>
<p><a href="https://gript.ie/forced-vaccination-law-denmark-reportedly-dropped/">https://gript.ie/forced-vaccination-law-denmark-reportedly-dropped/</a></p>
<p>You'll notice Macron came out and said that the vaccine will not be mandatory.</p>
<p>- In Italy the health services have confirmed PCR tests are 95% false positive in their results and lawsuits are coming:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/robinmonotti/status/1331500903564775426">https://twitter.com/robinmonotti/status/1331500903564775426</a></p>
<p>There you go. It's not over by a long shot and it won't be. Don't be disheartened, just keep doing what you can and informing people. Don't get forceful about it, pick your battles, and inform people in a friendly manner. Remember that most people are doing what they're doing not because they come from a malicious place, but rather because they're scared and want the best for themselves and their families. They're misinformed. Break the truth down for them and once they're awake they'll never be asleep again.</p>
<p>Btw I know I have a couple of very negative posts in my topic history if you happen to see it but sometimes you get down, everybody does. I do think there's light at the end of the tunnel and we will win in the end. In fact the damage that the mainstream media and establishment institutions are causing to themselves right now may be irrevocable. Distrust in MSM and government has never been so high and alternative more truthful sources of media are more popular than ever. They're losing their narrative and they know it. The only reason most people obey the rules now in the UK is because they're worried about being fined -- not because they're worried about the damn virus. Be positive and don't stop fighting, we will win.</p></p>

<p>I agree with everything you said and it does give me some hope. What worries me is that most of the resistance seems to be online. I follow people on twitter who get 100 likes every time they say anything on the subject but liking a tweet isn't going to change much is it. People are so used to armchair politics these days but it's not going to be enough this time. I'm fully aware that I'm guilty of it myself though.  </p>
<p>Can you imagine an evil overlord noticing that 100 people on twitter have seen through his evil plan. He'd be all like 'Mwahahahahahaha! I'm taking over the world and all these peasants do is retweet articles'</p>

        <p>I have to correct on the thing from Italy: 95% false positives when run at a cycle rate over 30.</p>
<p>Under 30, they are 95% accurate from double-blind studies.</p>
<p>I.E. no 'running a swab from a sterile banana' and finding CoVid-19 on the swab.</p>

        <p>I’ve been resisting this crap since the first day. Curfew in my town? Immediately violated it with a couple of friends. </p>
<p>Mask mandate effective on Friday? Looks like I’m going out even more to show my always maskless face. </p>
<p>Local restaurant wants to require masks? I go there and refuse to wear it and make them make me leave. Reminding them the whole time they are disrespecting a loyal customer. Bonus points if it’s busy.</p>
<p>So many ways to fight this shit. Get creative! And tell me some things to do in this regard because I’m running out of ideas.</p>
