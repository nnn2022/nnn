        <p>SS: behind the paywall and reading between the lines two important facts are admitted. The delta variant has been around since October (“ravaged” India but look at their numbers today) and is now the dominant strain worldwide. Hey guess what, deaths and hospitalizations are nowhere near the same ratio as vanilla COVID-19. What conclusion would you draw if you used the actual scientific method and not doomer cult smooth brain logic?</p>
<p>^ What I would say in the interrogation room at my concentration camp anyways.</p>

        <p>Well there's lots of conclusions one might draw about the effectiveness of Ivermectin as deployed in India, as well as the ones that you allude to.</p>

        <p>India has done  great, compared to almost every western nation. Way way better than the US anyway.</p>
<p>300 deaths per million vs 1800 deaths per million.</p>
<p>The same way the garbage media attacks states like Florida who are also doing very well.</p>

        <p>They were all discovered from August to December</p>
<p>The exact same time the vaccines were in trial</p>
<p>Brazil, India, UK, South Africa which are the home's of the most famous variants and all have one thing in common, Astrazeneca had vaccine trial's there</p>
<p>Alpha, formerly known as the B.1.1.7 variant, first turned up in the United Kingdom in September.</p>
<p>Beta, or B.1.351, was first detected in South Africa in September.</p>
<p>The gamma, or P.1, variant was first reported in December, in Japanese travelers who had recently returned from Brazil.</p>
<p>Delta, or B.1.671.2, is the latest — and currently the most concerning — variant of concern. It was first identified in India late last year.</p>
