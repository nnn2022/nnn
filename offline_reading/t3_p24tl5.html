    <strong>A message to visitors and would-be trolls...</strong>
    <p><p>If you stand in opposition to this sub and our members this sub is not for you and I am asking you to leave us alone.</p>
<p>We do however allow respectful visitors who are here to ask good-faith questions, factual clarifications and polite discussion.  If you are actually interested in those things, than participation is a possibility however you and any users, posts and comments are subject for removal for any reason.  These are the terms so if you don't agree to them, please refer to the opening statement above.</p>
<p>While I don't like any of the name calling, unwarranted downvoting  or general hostility that you might encounter here, we have little sympathy due to the constant harassment campaign that is being waged against us with complicity by Reddit employees.</p>
<p>I ask users here to avoid engaging with abusive users that make their way into the sub and also to try to be kind to good-faith visitors.  But I know from my own personal experience that it can be hard not to take the bait and also there is a practical limit to how many times you can be slapped while trying to turn the other cheek.</p></p>

        <p>It's unfortunately hard to tell now who is a good faith visitor vs a sarcastic troll. Just remember - when they resort to name calling in the middle of a factual discussion, know you are on the right side of history!</p>

        <p>&rt;you are a moron</p>
<p>Crops up when they have nothing left to say.  I am a moron, BUT what makes me dig my heals in when insulted is the fact that those insulting, actually cannot grasp this simple fact…</p>
<p><strong>this is my moronic body, my moronic choice, my funeral</strong></p>
<p>The fact they dont get that,  is what makes this doubly annoying. </p>
<p>I have a friend who supplemented their income doing clinical trials. They had limits on ‘rest’ periods between different trials, but a few times looked like shit as these chemicals coursed and finally cleared the body. Many a time I thought that they were mad, but never once said it out allowed.  </p>
<p>All I want is the same respect for my decision.</p>

        <p>JFLOL at the things trolls will do to bring this sub down. Everything from garden-variety trolling to blatant racism, antisemitism, gore pics, accusing users of child porn, the list just goes on with these people, especially the pieces of shit from NNNB and Covidiots. Just the other day, some vaxxtard, probably angry he got the shot, posted gore on this sub.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm trying to do what I think is necessary even though the content guide is perhaps a little vague with some concepts and I have some familiarity with a couple subs I was following that were shut down and were for good reason based on what I saw myself there.</p>
<p>The more famous examples like t_d and chapos, I wasn't familiar enough to know exactly why they were shut down other than what I've heard.</p>
<p>Users here are obviously accused of being "disease vectors" but I don't get the impression that people are doing much other than going around to various subs and challenging the narrative.</p>
<p>I can't imagine many subs getting this kind of volume of attacks against it.  I have to ban so many people just coming to curse us out every day, it's insane.  With all of the data Reddit has about users and their activity, I'm pretty sure they have a pretty clear picture of who's doing the brigading.  There are a dozen of them at least that I know are top contributors.  But that's the basis of a huge part of reddit now where they find examples of people they consider worthy of their scorn and post it in these subs where everyone takes turns saying either how much they hate the people in the group they are targeting and/or how stupid/disgusting etc. they are.  Fun times.</p>

        <p>And all of that just makes what you do that much more important. It really does. </p>
<p>I don't know if it was you or another mod, but one of my early posts here got removed and almost got me banned. Whoever that was, they were chill as fuck about it and actually helpful more than anything! </p>

        <p>I'd have to check but it was hopefully me because I did lose my patience with a couple people at least recently...</p>
<p>I will try to be cool with everyone and the vast majority of legit users are cool as well so it makes it easy to do so and realize I can sometimes get something wrong and I'll admit to it.</p>
<p>The vast majority of problems are caused by accounts that are easy to identify that everyone is most familiar with but these are just the grunts that sap up time that could otherwise be spent on stopping the ones that actually do damage as opposed to annoy and curse people out.</p>
