        <p>The "normal" you're talking about is pre-covid, where the government has the power to take away constitutional rights because "oh no, there's a disease that's killing all the old people who are past their life expectancy who might otherwise live a few months to a year" and people are dumb enough to let them get away with it because their idiot boxes do their thinking for them. You think we actually want to go back to that? </p>
<p>You think you actually made a good point? What you posted was literally "follow the rules,  conform, be obedient". Your post doesn't make a good point at all...it assumes we're stupid and it's meant to mock us not make us think.</p>

        <p>So what your saying is that you would prefer to watch dozens of people die from covid instead of being inconvenienced for a month or so? That sounds a little selfish to me. </p>
<p>Yeah most people who die are over 70, or have pre-existing medical conditions, but how would you feel if you were dying because some people are too self-centred to follow some restrictions? Who knows these people could live a lot longer. You guys make a few good points, but at the end of the day we're the ones who voted in the people who've made these decisions and they have advice from some of our smartest minds. You can't tell me you actually think every government in the world is trying to harm humanity.</p>

        <p>&rt; but how would you feel if you were dying because some people are too self-centred to follow some restrictions?</p>
<p>You mean like we did before covid whenever the flu killed people but we weren't all scared of it because there was no ticker at the bottom of every news channel pumping fear into our brains every single day?</p>
<p>Leaders of the world are not elected, they are selected. Take the US for example. Democrats and Republicans are basically enemies that are supposed to hate each other. Why do you think that someone as evil as George W. Bush is rubbing elbows and being all buddy buddy with the Obamas? They are all playing for the same team. They all have someone above them giving orders. You don't get to be in a position with that much power unless they have something on you that they can blackmail you with to keep you in line. I know, it sounds conspiratorial but it's the Rockefellers and Rothschilds of the world that run the whole thing. And as far as getting advise from some of our smartest minds, the only "minds" that are allowed to have a say are those that toe the line out of fear of losing funding.</p>
