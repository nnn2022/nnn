        <p>Excerpt:</p>
<p>&rt;Newly analyzed documents reveal that the “Spanish Flu” may have been a military vaccine experiment gone awry.
&rt;
&rt;In looking back on the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I, we need to delve deeper to solve this mystery.
&rt;
&rt;Summary
&rt;
&rt;The reason modern technology has not been able to pinpoint the killer influenza strain from this pandemic is because influenza was not the killer.
&rt;
&rt;More soldiers died during WWI from disease than from bullets.
&rt;
&rt;The pandemic was not flu. An estimated 95% (or higher) of the deaths were caused by bacterial pneumonia, not influenza/a virus.
&rt;
&rt;The pandemic was not Spanish. The first cases of bacterial pneumonia in 1918 trace back to a military base in Fort Riley, Kansas.
&rt;
&rt;<strong>From January 21 – June 4, 1918, an experimental bacterial meningitis vaccine cultured in horses by the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York was injected into soldiers at Fort Riley.</strong>
&rt;
&rt;During the remainder of 1918 as those soldiers – often living and traveling under poor sanitary conditions – were sent to Europe to fight, they spread bacteria at every stop between Kansas and the frontline trenches in France.
&rt;
&rt;One study describes soldiers “with active infections (who) were aerosolizing the bacteria that colonized their noses and throats, while others—often, in the same “breathing spaces”—were profoundly susceptible to invasion of and rapid spread through their lungs by their own or others’ colonizing bacteria.” (1)
&rt;
&rt;The “Spanish Flu” attacked healthy people in their prime.  Bacterial pneumonia attacks people in their prime. Flu attacks the young, old and immunocompromised.
&rt;
&rt;When WW1 ended on November 11, 1918, soldiers returned to their home countries and colonial outposts, spreading the killer bacterial pneumonia worldwide.</p>

        <p>You cannot spread bacterial pneumonia. It is not aerosolized. You have to actually KISS someone or something even more intimate in order to pass bacterial pneumonia from person to person.</p>
<p>The above coming straight from a doctor who I trust greatly at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore who agrees with me that CoVid-19 is weak sauce.</p>
