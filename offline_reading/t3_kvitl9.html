    <strong>"Can my employer require me to be vaccinated for the coronavirus?" "Yes."</strong>
    <p><p>I found <a href="https://www.nj.com/coronavirus/2021/01/nj-covid-vaccine-can-employers-require-that-workers-take-the-coronavirus-vaccine.html">this article</a> while scouring the internet for vaccination news. </p>
<p>I want to bring this part to the attention of the users here:</p>
<p>&rt; Can my employer require me to be vaccinated for the coronavirus?</p>
<p>&rt; Yes.</p>
<p>&rt; The Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued guidance recently that employment law experts had been expecting. It said the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), which gives workers some rights when it comes to an employer requiring certain medical exams, doesn’t apply when it comes to COVID vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt; “If a vaccine is administered to an employee by an employer for protection against contracting Covid-19, the employer is not seeking information about an individual’s impairments or current health status, and, therefore, it is not a medical examination,” EEOC said on its website.</p>
<p>&rt; It said the requirement of a COVID vaccine would be permitted.</p>
<p>&rt; Employers have an obligation to ensure that their employees have a healthy and safe work environment, said Dennis Alessi, a partner and co-chair of the employment law group at Mandelbaum Salsburg on Roseland.</p>
<p>&rt; “It is based on this obligation that employers are permitted to require employee testing for COVID-19,” Alessi said, noting he was expecting the EEOC decision that employers would have the right to require employee vaccinations.</p>
<p>&rt; Employers may require vaccines if the failure to vaccinate will result in a direct threat to other employees, agreed Timothy Ford, partner and member of the employment and litigation departments at Einhorn, Barbarito, Frost &amp; Botwinick in Denville.</p>
<p>But nah, "they'll never require people to get vaccines so they can keep their jobs" says some people on here...</p></p>

        <p>See its not mandatory because the government isn't making you do it.</p>
<p>And you won't get a shot without signing a consent form,  so you wanted it.  </p>
<p>See, no one was forced.  You wanted it.  And you cant sue your employer if you are harmed.</p>
