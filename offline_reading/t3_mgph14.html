    <strong>This "conspiracy theory" just came to my mind and I'd like to hear some opinions.</strong>
    <p><p>Recently I got a new ID card and the lady asked me if I would like to give my finger prints because it will be mandatory soon. </p>
<p>This made me think. Isn't that just to monitor people? What's about the EU law which requires you to make a video call and show your ID when you want to activate a SIM card?</p>
<p><em>Now the link to Covid:</em></p>
<p>Every student in my country is tested and a lot of workplaces do it as well. In fact, my government is trying to make tests mandatory everywhere. School, work, basically everytime you go in public.</p>
<p>We know that those tests aren't very accurate but if it comes back positive you have to quarantine and wait until they've done a PCR test. </p>
<p>So basically, the state has your finger prints, your phone number and your fucking DNA. How long will it take until they'll monitor where we are all the time to  "identify hotspots" or something like that.</p>
<p>Are we under general suspicion? What happened to privacy and why can they take it away just like that?</p></p>

        <p>ID card for school or for a driver's license? </p>
<p>I think there is some truth to your conspiracy because of what my city is now installing. They are installing cameras at every major intersection. These cameras will store footage and be able to detect license plate numbers of vehicles. They are NOT the unconstitutional red light cameras. These are just cameras. Sounds innocent enough, but remember when two weeks turned into a year and vaccine passports?</p>

<p>An official identity card every citizen has to have</p>
<p>&rt;but remember when two weeks turned into a year and vaccine passports?</p>
<p>Yes it really seemes like they are sneakily building an infrastructure made to monitor everyone and everything using the fight against covid as an excuse. </p>
<p>I'm happy this place exists. Everywhere else I'd just recieve a permanent ban and be called an idiot.</p>

<p>If you live in the EU, then you have unless you've not been using your current SIM for several years.
Either that or you went there in person to show them your ID.</p>
<p>&rt;And I've only been pcr tested where I've required it</p>
<p>As I said: every single student gets tested and if the test is positive, they have to get a PCR test. There just was a story in the news where about 70% of the positively tested were not actually infected. 
Many workplaces require regular tests. If you visit another country or come back you need a test. It gets more every day.</p>
<p>This isn't exaggeration.</p>
