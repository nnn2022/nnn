    <strong>The Fate of Doomers is Only To Be Lab Rats and Obedient Slaves to Their Master Fauci and the Government.</strong>
    <p><p>After observing many of you irl and on reddit, all of you are the same. Lazy, unambitious and who had no lives prior to covid. You fools only find virtue and happiness in being lab rats to test whatever your Master, who is the government and fauci commands you to. You people worship the masks (which don't work btw) and obediently ready to take this vaccine which the long term side affects aren't even known. You doomers love virtue signaling us if we protest or don't mask, yet, you all are sitting in your homes secretly hoping this covid nonsense doesn't end.  Why? </p>
<p>Because you love those petty government checks and you don't want to go back to your old miserable fucking lives. It makes you feel good huh seeing all of us locked up in our homes and in misery? You blind idiots do not see the economic destruction that is here, and more restrictions that are coming. You fuckers only love getting fucked in the ass hard by your Master. You are their little free to use rag dolls. </p>
<p>You socialists/communists are the lowest of the low and the most clownest out of all. You have gave up your freedoms, basic rights and honor for a fucking disease which has a 99.7% survival rate. Are you that dumb to give up everything for this? Masks don't do shit (many studies have been done on this) and social distancing is dividing Us more than ever, and people literally fear each other now. If I was to social distance Myself from anyone, that would be from you worthless doomers. </p>
<p>You conveniently overlook suicides, people being denied medical treatment in favor/fear of Covid, victims being locked up with their abusers, small businesses going under, government's growing tyranny with power and blatantly flaunting their own rules, your friends and families collective-mental health plummeting, children's education and development suffering, and the figures and statistics from States like Florida and Texas which have gone down, in your , borderline psychopathic endorsement of lockdowns and face masks.</p>
<p>You Doomer's only ambition in life is to obey, bow down and be a slave to the government and to add the cherry on top, you will put on your hazmat suits to please your Masters even more. And oh, also, to be their lab rats to test this experimental vaccine for them, not even knowing the long term side effects of it. And, for the ones who obediently took the vaccine and still are double masking and social distancing, WTF. How fucking stupid you have to be to do that? </p>
<p>And yet, you still virtue signal us while you are making fool of yourselves. Your Master Fauci and his crew are laughing their asses off rn looking at you and I bet it's hard for even them to believe, how easy it is to brainwash and manipulate this clown society for their own gain and benefit. And for the people on this Sub, we didn't come into this world to be fucking lab rats. Fuck that. We came here for a purpose which is to do whatever the hell we want to do, and have freedom in this so called "free" country who promised us our basic freedoms. </p>
<p>There is no high in living just a boring and simple life and submitting to the government which y'all love to do. Rather, life is a wonderful adventure and no 1 should be able to stop us. I personally like to live My life on the edge, and Idgaf about death and love to take all the risks. Time is very limited here and life is very short, and we must make the most of it and do whatever we want in this limited time. No fucking 1 should be able to take our basic rights away. Fuck them. And you doomers, go back to your old miserable lives, and who's only source of happiness and purpose in life is by dictating others to quad mask.</p></p>

<p>You made the case better than I could have and hit on all the points too. Seriously, life isn't about just "surviving" or being "safe." It's about LIVING.</p>

<p>You know it brother! And I will live fucking freely. Our purpose in this life wasn't to be obedient slaves to the government like the doomers. There is more to this life.</p>
