    <strong>Riddle me this...</strong>
    <p><p>You need to get a vaccine in order to travel, testing will no longer be done to check if you're positive or negative (wtf lol) even though you can still test positive after being vaxxed.</p>
<p>The vaccine doesnt grand total immunity, obviously. So it dramatically reduces the chances the virus has of harming your body, but you're still a carrier anyways, meaning you can still pass it onto others even if you're fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>So, the social distancing and all that masking stuff is suddenly ineffective as now the only possible way you can gain access to service is through getting the vaccine even though less than a month ago it was still fine. But at the same time you need to mask up so you dont spread it to others and social distance so you dont spread it to others.</p>
<p>Suddenly, everything bad is the unvaccinated's fault because they are now putting peoples lives at risk by not taking a 90% effective jab that needs boosters because its effects on the immune system dwindle and the new and improved versions of the vaccines set for 2023 and 2024 are supposed to counter act that.</p>
<p>Riddle me this, </p>
<p>You're vaccinated and own a business and everyone is vaccinated. Here I am, unvaccinated and walk into the place, and you cant allow me service unless I prove I'm vaccinated because you fear I might pass the virus around to others who are vaccinated but because the vaccine is so half assed they can literally get sick from it. Granted, the sickness wouldn't be fatal.</p>
<p>Okay.... But what if I already HAD the virus, and now I'm naturally immune to it? I'm supposed to just go and fuck myself? lmao</p>
<p>fun fact, the death rate from covid among populations under 60 is literally 324 a week. That's literally nothing. Considering that it's basically a slightly harsher version of the flu, its nothing to be worried about IN THIS current state and time.</p>
<p><em>almost as if being vaccinated makes 0 difference in terms of catching the virus for the majority of the population, except for the older age groups</em></p></p>

        <p>This is thing that baffles me the most about vaccine passports. They do nothing whatsoever to stop covid spreading. You could have a restaurant, plane or whatever full of vaccinated people, but if one of them has covid, chances are everyone‚Äôs getting it. There‚Äôs really no logic to them</p>

        <p>...what? No, people who are vaccinated are substantially less likely to get sick. Those that do get sick have a lower viral load and therefore are less likely to spread it, and on top of that those that do get sick are much more likely to have a very mild case rather than a severe or fatal case. 10% chance of breakthrough is not equal to 100% chance of breakthrough. On top of that it's a HUGE reduction in chance of contracting a fatal case because your body recognizes the invader through seeing the spike protein. Like, just no</p>

        <p>I agree with them on that front. Dude, I got tested positive twice at the same hospital in the same way two different times within the span of 8 months. I survived both times, though the first time I got sick it was really fucked up... Really bad chest pain, coughing, tasteless, no sense of smell, etc. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The second time I had it I just had no sense of taste or smell, headaches, and diarrhea lol.</p>

        <p>I think the most telling thing is the fact that it took you 4 paragraphs of mental gymnastics just to even halfway make sense of what‚Äôs going on lol </p>
<p>I think that‚Äôs a good indication that ZERO logic is being applied to this situation if you view it from a health perspective (which obviously it‚Äôs not)</p>
<p>If this shit made any sense at all you could sum it up very simply, but there is way too many inconsistencies to possibly do that. Not to mention that you didn‚Äôt even touch on HALF of the fucked up shit that is going on.</p>
<p>So the mental gymnastics of someone who took all this in and accepted it as making sense has even more tumbles in their routine. Lol</p>
