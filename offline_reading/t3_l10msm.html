    <strong>I am absolutely disgusted and appalled on how we've become as a species.</strong>
    <p><p>Super rant here.</p>
<p>Before 2010 it wasn't like this. I think social media played a huge factor in here.</p>
<p>How distant and far and judgemental and narcissistic we've become.</p>
<p>How we think we know it all just because we read a tweet somewhere, and that we are social activists just because we changed our profile picture to a rainbow tainted one. Everyone is lost in a blurry haze mindlessly scrolling all day long, wasting all of their days.  Eating up brain junk, propaganda, hate towards each other, hate towards the one who don't think the same as you do, thinking that you know best.</p>
<p>The perfect selfie has become the most important thing that you can do. The amount of followers you have determines the importance that your voice will have. We have forgot how to be close and how to be nice to each other, we'd rather spend our time fighting with an anonymous account on reddit than call our loved ones and ask them how they are keeping up.</p>
<p>Hate for your neighbour, hate for the different one, hate for the free person, hate for hate speech.</p>
<p>Just drowning in your fake manufactured narcissism and feeling of self-importance made by fake internet points and hearts.</p>
<p>Thinking you're doing something valuable for humanity, but your eyes are becoming red from the too much scrolling and the only thing that you are achieving is more depression, disconnection, and some red itchy eyes.</p>
<p>Chatting with your friend when you're with your mom, and chatting with your mom when you're with your friend.</p>
<p>We are losing ourselves, slowly. Our brains have been intoxicated, and not by substances.</p>
<p>Subcultures are being destroyed and dismantled, alternative people are being looked down upon as conspiranoia theorists, terrorists, hippie junkies, Q followers (wtf?) even if you live in zambia and you don't even know who trump is.</p>
<p>What is the true alternative anymore? When alternative thinking people are spending all day in front of their cellphones, giving all your data and thoughts away to big corporations who are using it to predict your next move and manipulate you.</p>
<p>We are all social activists, we are all terrorists, we are all sheep and spreading misinformations, we are all karens, and everyone is racist. According to some. According to what twitter made you think they are. So much hate for one another, not even the time to stop and ask 'hey, why do you think the way you do?'</p>
<p>Afraid of smiling faces, afraid of seeing your friends, afraid of seeing your parents.</p>
<p>This is not a world i want to live in.</p>
<p>Please do me a favour, delete all that social media who's turning your brain into mush, wasting your precious time and attention, and keeping us here ranting and upvoting and bloating over news that we have no control over, instead of uniting and doing something, changing something for real. That's why they (bigcorps, government) would rather keep us typing this shit on the internet, and that's why i dont think this sub is going to be banned. it is good for them, us typing all day doing absolutely nothing to unite and change the course of things. screening our thoughts, our emotions.</p>
<p>Everyone is typing 'revolution!' 'freedom!' 'guillotines!' but we're too weak and busy downvoting anonymous comments instead of standing up and organising and doing something. and they know that, and won't take away our precious subreddits and social media.</p>
<p>Social media is what has put us into this mess. We would have never agreed to do something like this (lockdowns) if we wouldnt have been so comfy in our own bubble made of couch, netflix and zoom calls. The rules are changing week by week, if there wasnt any social media, we couldnt have been following up, and we would have think it was a mad thing to do, even more than we do now.</p>
<p>How far and distant we've become... 2010 was a totally different world than today... the real revolution is deleting social media. not giving them your informations, not giving them your thoughts. not giving them your energy and your precious time. not giving them attention. not giving them stock value, and the ability for them to manipulate you.</p>
<p>I would have so many more things to write about this, i think it would become a TLDR post.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to hear your opinions, even if you disagree with me, happy to have a healthy debate. Although I'd rather prefer no one replying to this thread and be downvoted to hell so I can once and for all delete this propaganda cesspool that is reddit.</p></p>

        <p>You're right. 100 percent.</p>
<p>I'm guilty of it right now. Here I am... Should be up for work in 6.5 hours but I'm here jamming artificial light into my brain in this echo chamber that is our subreddit. At least I'm connecting with like-minded people, getting a dopamine rush from telling doomers how stupid they are.</p>
<p>We're all guilty of it sometimes.</p>

        <p>This is very true.   Despite it being an echo chamber, (r/Coronavirus is an echo chamber as well) I think it does have some use as an outlet, especially if IRL you're in a situation where you feel you can't speak your opinion. Like if you have a doomer family or you fear for your job if you question any of this doomer crap. <br>
  However, OP is largely right though, social media has driven us to reduce our self worth and identity to equate to digital "likes" which actually makes us more sheep like than we'd like to admit.</p>

        <p>Yeah I agree with this a lot, and I‚Äôm relatively young. I don‚Äôt use social media, neither does my girlfriend, and few of our friends are all that into it either. What I can appreciate about the contemporary internet is all the interesting creative content that‚Äôs out there today; case in point, obscure philosophical podcasts, musical microgenres, and ultra-niche YouTube channels. You wouldn‚Äôt have the same degree access to that sort of media even 20 years ago. While I‚Äôd love to lament the dancing nurses of TikTok, the whole phenomenon is a double edged sword.</p>

        <p>You have spoken nothing but the truth. To those who still have social media they are weak minded. It‚Äôs a crutch and it seems like everyone needs it. Dopamine from our internet boxes is willpower‚Äôs torture. Today‚Äôs world is ass backwards making you feel like the center of the universe. I‚Äôm still young have been off of social media‚Äôs for a while. When I see grown men who giggle over tik tok and Snapchat I crumble and know it‚Äôs already gone too far.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôm going to be contrarian here and say that I don‚Äôt think social media has as much to do with it as you claim. I think people have always been, as a whole, weak, gullible sheep who follow the path of least resistance. A small percentage of people are smart, powerful, and determined enough to shape where the rest of us go, and it just so happens that this is the direction those people chose this year. People have always been like this, it‚Äôs just that this year they were told to be myopic and focus on Covid. In previous decades it was other issues. </p>
<p>I can see clearly now how the holodomor, Khmer Rouge, Holocaust, and countless other atrocities occurred. All it takes is a few Machiavellian people in the right places to push the right buttons and we‚Äôll head down this path as a species every time.</p>

        <p>Agreed. I deleted social media and find myself reaching for my cell phone less. I hardly take pictures because who the hell am I uploading them for? I engage in conversation more at the table and when I'm out and about. I even find myself leaving my cell phone at home when I run out to the store. My head has been clearer and I feel better. Social media is a psychological experiment gone horribly wrong.</p>

        <p>I never had social media in the traditional sense - no Twitter, no Facebook, no instagram, etc. Does reddit count? Maybe a bit, but I always used it kind of like how forums were used back in the day, and I think the anon nature of that doesn't really make it in the same bracket. </p>
<p>I feel like based on what I'm seeing now and have seen over the last few years, this was the right call on my part. </p>
<p>What's funny is whenever I see someone in my life use it, they're rarely getting any joy from it, so it baffles me why they continue.</p>

        <p>Man, you're right, I was never doing it before but your comment and calling me a dickhead convinced me to wear one. I don't think I would have ever come around if not for you. Do you realize how many lives you just saved? I can't even begin to count (because it's it's zero).</p>

        <p>Say the same thing in real life to a 17 year old teenager and see how you feel. doesn't feel right does it. You don't see me going around insulting people do you? What makes you think you can insult people online? Because they're never gonna get you. Because you won't face the consequences. Hm, you know, if a person was to insult someone like that in real life, they'd be considered a bad person. Think of it like this. Try and imagine all the times you've insulted people online, and then imagine what it would be like if you said allll of that to different people, outside, face to face. You'd be such a horrible person wouldn't you? You're lucky you have what you have, now leave people alone, please, there's no need for pestering everyone.</p>
<p>Also to the people who dump masks in the bushes after they're finished with them, please stop.</p>
