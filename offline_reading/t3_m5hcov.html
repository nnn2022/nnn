    <strong>Constructive criticism</strong>
    <p><p>It’s truely impossible to live in a world with a “normal” set of beliefs, our world is constantly evolving and we as inhabitants of said world are constantly evolving with it. Any new information presented to anyone about anything invariably does and SHOULD impact that person in such a way that they can’t revert back to a previous state the same premise goes for our world. While it is scary that things will never go back to the way they were we can get excited because new great things are to come!</p></p>

        <p>I agree this world is ever changing and we should do our best to keep up with it, but this isn’t a natural change, this is forced change through mandate and legislation created by a set of people who have a known record for throwing human rights out of the pram when they have a tantrum!</p>
<p>Change is all well and good, but there is a reason we developed fundamental human rights that should never be challenged or removed... yet these rights were removed without being challenged!</p>

        <p>Any change humans have brought about isn’t a natural change though, everything has been influenced (or corrupted) by society. We are beyond the point of changes happening to our world being natural and regardless of whether the change is caused by nature or us changes are still going to be made. </p>
<p>My simplest example of this would be our modern banana (a childish example I know but that’s kind of the point) it’s been changed by thousands of years of farming and and genetic altering it’s not natural yet it’s something many people still eat. </p>
<p>Another example is that we (homo sapiens) in our current form aren’t technically natural. Humans aren’t what they used to be we have changed to something beyond nature due to years and years of us evolving and evolving the world around us.</p>

        <p>Yes but there are inherent basic fundamental things that living mammals of all sorts need that haven’t changed in millennia, these are oxygen, food, heat and community. They are as natural as can be!</p>

        <p>You know I definitely can’t argue against that. Humans of course need food, oxygen and heat. This doesn’t change the fact that we aren’t in our original or natural state and neither is the planet we live on.</p>

        <p>Sure the world always changes. <br>
10 years ago I could never have dreamed of the technology I now possess and find normal. Sure i immediately grant that, changes for the better are always being made.  </p>
<p>But a world without hugs or handshakes, without seeing your friends, without going to a party or a bar, without soccermatches or concerts, without even being able to go to a computer store and buy one of those amazing new items part of the evolving world you speak of because it's not "essential". Without smiling faces, without being able to sit down in a restaurant, without being able to go outside after 9PM. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Without a dozen more things. That is NOT part of the good kind of evolution we should welcome.</p>

        <p>I actually one hundred percent agree with this, however we need to make sacrifices in order to stay safer (which I’m sure is something that has been said countless times over the last year) however people aren’t making those sacrifices if people had listened in the first place our current situation would not be so bad and what’s worse is that the people that did stay safe at first are now (rightfully) getting angry at the people that didn’t and getting sick of staying safe meaning that the smart and dumb people are both still doing risky activities. It’s sad but we have to face the reality that we live in society primarily filled with dumbasses and that means we are going to evolve in dumb ways. 
The whole concept of a “new normal” is this idea in its simplest form. We live in a dumb world and with our current youth (me included) the world is only going to get dumber. Even though technology is evolving at an astounding rate the masses are losing basic intelligence which is sad but it’s a sad truth we have to face.</p>

        <p>" however we need to make sacrifices in order to stay safer  " </p>
<p>I guess this is where you and we disagree then, we do no need to make sacrifices for a virus with a 98+% survival rate. Especially not with measures that are currently being rolled about which fall in tow categories: the useless and the simply wrong.   </p>
<p>And it's okay to disagree. As long as we stay respectful. Just you do you and do anything that makes you feel safe. But realize it is not MY job to make you feel safe, it is yóur job to make you feel safe. And for that purpose you get to do whatever you like and make as many sacrifices as you think are necessary. The line in the sand here is when you start trying to make me do a job you ought to be doing yourself.</p>

        <p>I mean no disrespect, in actuality I respect you a lot because your argument has a logical premise. A good intention building into ultimately a sound and strong idea. I also agree it isn’t your job to make me feel safe, I feel safe by living life the way I live life.  However my original argument isn’t based around MY safety rather the safety of the whole population sure 2% isn’t a big mortality rate but it is still scary to others and this “new normal” isn’t here for me or you it’s here for everyone </p>
<p>(Although I definitely agree that some of the human races reaction is over the top and sometimes just plain wrong it’s not up to me to make those decisions so why argue against it)</p>

        <p>I'm glad we can be respectful regardless of our disagreement. I can see in what you write that you still have a lot of hope for the good in humanity. Hold on to that by all means! And may you be happy through all of this.

        <p>Honestly I’d say we are past the point of no return and have been for a while, our whole modern society has been built on the back of war and hatred. How can you build something good if the foundation is inherently bad. </p>
<p>Which I guess means the only way to “fix” our world would be to start fresh which of course won’t happen (until our planet dies because of our own egos)</p>
