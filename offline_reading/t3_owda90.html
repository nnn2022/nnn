    <strong>What part of "the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission" do you not understand?</strong>
    <p><p>This is a rant against the doomers who think we must all take the vaccine so we can keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>The CDC has now confirmed the vaccines don't prevent trasmission, and yet, I still see you doomers insisting everyone to take the vaccine to keep others safe. NEWSFLASH, if they don't stop the spread, you're not helping anyone if you're taking these! The vaccinated can spread the virus just as easily as the non-vaccinated, and it's been proven at this point. Of course, many of us have known for several months now that the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission, but recently the CDC has finally confirmed it. Yet, you still blame us non-vaccinated for Covid outbreaks and new variants.</p>
<p>For this reason, there is absolute zero reason have any vaccine mandates. Like the vaccine passport system. It was already bad enough to have such a system in place even without that factor, but the fact that they don't stop transmission makes it even worse.</p>
<p>In fact, there's this cruise line that required vaccination to be on the ship, and guess what? THERE WAS A COVID OUTBREAK THERE, DESPITE EVERYONE BEING VACCINATED.</p>
<p>In fact, some evidence suggests that these vaccines might only be prolonging the pandemic by introducing new variants, instead of the other way around. You know, these new variants you doomers are so scared of.</p>
<p>This also means any herd immunity goals through vaccination won't be reached. It doesn't matter if everyone in the world was vaccinated. The virus would still be going around. The only way this pandemic could probably end is through the use of Ivermectin, which is not only one of the safest drugs in existence, but absolutely decimates Covid cases, as seen when India tried this. But no, since Big Pharma doesn't profit from Ivermectin, they just have to discourage the use of it as much as they can, and push us to use a poisonous vaccine that doesn't even work.</p>
<p>If we ever get out of the pandemic (I use that term lightly, of course), I can guarantee it won't be through vaccination. It would be through Ivermectin or immunity from previous infections.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely.  The obvious way forward looking at all the statistical data and the real world performance of their garbage vaccine is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Encourage widespread vaccination the elderly.  They're most at risk, and long term side effects matter far far less.  Same goes for people with extreme comorbidities.  These people should then also be encouraged to take measures to protect themselves by limiting their exposures to virus.  Others should be cautious around these vulnerable populations, wear masks around them for whatever limited protection it may provide.  Stay away when having any type of respiratory/allergy symptoms.  Or not, it's their choice in the end, but let the adults make their own choices.  In other words, the Swedish model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ban any further vaccination of those under 50 without serious comorbidities.  As you said, the vaccination is not protective of others, and a vanishingly small number of people without those issues have serious experiences with the virus.  The vaccination is far more likely to do harm in the present and possibly in the future.  No one knows what the long term effects may be, but the indications are leaning negative (lipid nanoparticles spreading from injection sites to dangerous tissues like ovaries and bone marrow).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only way to herd immunity is allowing those less vulnerable to acquire natural immunity.  The studies available indicate long-term T-cell immunity in the blood and bone marrow.  Natural immunity is also more effective than the shit vaccination which only works (in its extremely limited way) if the spike protein doesn't mutate (which is already why delta gets around it, delta contains spike protein mutations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Widespread use of prophylactic ivermectin.  It's far more effective than the vaccine, and will limit any danger of overwhelming health care systems.  It also shows promise for treating vaccine injury and long covid, as it appears to prevent/limit the spike proteins from damaging cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open everything back up.  Put FCC regulations on social media companies to prevent censorship of competing (not MIS) information from non-government sources.  That's not how science works, and has prolonged and worsened the severity of the pandemic.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Ahh yes, give the old people a vaccine known to cause blood clots and heart attacks and when they die from blood clots and heart attacks, you just blame it on old age......</p>
<p>This is so obvious to me that I dont understand how most people cant see it.</p>

        <p>&rt; which is already why delta gets around it, delta contains spike protein mutations</p>
<p>This implies vaccine immunity is ineffective, but that's wrong. In the few days it takes memory cells to start churning out antibodies, Delta is able to proliferate shockingly well thanks to those mutations (including <a href="https://media.nature.com/lw800/magazine-assets/d41586-021-02039-y/d41586-021-02039-y_19383078.gif">a harpoon/winch in the spike</a>). 1000x more than Wuhan strain. But those antibodies eventually arrive and combat the infection.</p>

        <p>I think its just mostly the paid shills. People I know in real life aren't this stupid/militant. Some even regret taking the vaccine because its being pushed so hard that they are wondering why they are so desperate to inject us.</p>

        <p>People don't even know the basics these days. Unvaxxed are vulnerable. Ok. But why would virus mutate in unvaxxed if they have weaker immunity. It's easy for virus to stay as it is. Mutation only occurs when the virus faces an obstacle, like antibodies induced by vaccines, to bypass it. This is evolution 101. Vaxxed are responsible for the mutations. Unvaxxed can be victims of mutations but not responsible for them.</p>

        <p>I have a fear that the govt and big pharma will use this "new info" of the vaccines not providing immunity as a new way to promote 100% vaccination. They're argument could be: "Yes the vax doesn't provide 100% immunity, but you become asymptomatic if you catch covid. If everyone were to get vaxxed, no one will die of covid and you won't even know if you have it. Therefor, we reach 100% herd 'immunity'"</p>

        <p>"A growing body of evidence indicates that people fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) are less likely than unvaccinated persons to acquire SARS-CoV-2 or to transmit it to others. However, the risk for SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection in fully vaccinated people cannot be completely eliminated as long as there is continued community transmission of the virus."</p>
<p>What the CDC currently says on their website. I've been seeing a lot of people say that the CDC has admitted that vaccinated people can transmit it just as much and I'd like to find some credible sources before I throw it out their in an argument.</p>

        <p>There’s a leaked contract between Pfizer and the Albanian government stating that the efficacy rate of their vaccine isn’t known- and the adverse reactions that could occur after mass vaccination are still unknown. So basically, they’re pushing an untested product that’s lacking data to prove its usefulness and that should be concerning to every one of us.</p>

<p>I read it and it seems like its almost as easy to spread the virus when you're vaccinated.  Please read it and give me your impression.  It doesn't come out and say it in plain English and it gives 4 disclaimers at the bottom.  But that's how I read it.</p>

        <p>"As population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger proportion of COVID-19 cases."</p>
<p>I get this article is pressing for more precautionary measures, but this statement alone takes away from everything they've been saying to us for the past year. I understand the logic behind it. I do. More people are becoming vaccinated, so therefore it makes sense that statistically more of those cases with be vaccinated people. I also understand how herd immunity works. But <em>79%</em> of the people who tested positive were vaccinated. With herd immunity being estimated at 70-90 percent, the efficacy of the vaccine does <em>not</em> look good.</p>
<p>Also, to anyone who wants to read the article, look at the part where it shows that four out of the five people hospitalized were vaccinated.</p>

        <p>They knew from the very beginning that the efficacy of these vaccines were quite bad, its almost like they designed them to be that way...</p>

&rt;A recently released study in which macaques were vaccinated with one vaccine candidate — this one being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca — showed the primates were protected from Covid-induced pneumonia. But the macaques still had high levels of virus replicating in their upper airways. (The paper was a pre-print, meaning it hasn’t yet been peer-reviewed and published in a journal.)</p>
<p>It is exactly why, from the very beginning they said even if this vaccine only has a 50/50 chance of stopping the spread (the same as a flu vaccine) that we should still proably get it.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/18/coronavirus-vaccine-with-50percent-efficacy-would-be-game-changer.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/18/coronavirus-vaccine-with-50percent-efficacy-would-be-game-changer.html</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The Food and Drug Administration indicated last month it would authorize a coronavirus vaccine as long as it is safe and at least 50% effective. Dr. Stephen Hahn, the agency's commissioner, said at the time it would be "unrealistic" to expect a vaccine to be 100% effective.</p>
<p>What most idiots dont understand, is the placebo works about 50/50. So the efficacy of a vaccine literally cant get any worse than that.........</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mental-health/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect">https://www.health.harvard.edu/mental-health/the-power-of-the-placebo-effect</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;A 2014 study led by Kaptchuk and published in Science Translational Medicine explored this by testing how people reacted to migraine pain medication. One group took a migraine drug labeled with the drug's name, another took a placebo labeled "placebo," and a third group took nothing. The researchers discovered that the placebo was 50% as effective as the real drug to reduce pain after a migraine attack.</p>
<p>We are literally surrounded by morons. And I know someone is going to call bs because I am comparing a vaccine with a migraine pill. But you should do yourself a favor and find some documentary's about the placebo effect. I have watched plenty of documentary's and read enough material to know that flu vaccines are bunk and thats exactly why I have never had one except maybe a couple times as a teen.</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://markstengler.com/health-risks/is-the-flu-shot-more-effective-than-a-placebo/">https://markstengler.com/health-risks/is-the-flu-shot-more-effective-than-a-placebo/</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;What evidence exists that the influenza vaccines reduce death of older people? According to Dosi’s review there are “virtually none.” He notes that influenza vaccines are approved for older people based not on their effectiveness but that they can induce antibody production. Increasing antibodies does not necessarily translate into not getting infected with the flu.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Doshi cites a review of studies done in 2010 which review the flu vaccine’s effectiveness for healthy people. It found that, “vaccinating between 33 and 100 people resulted in one less case of influenza.”</p>

        <p>Yeah, that's the scary part. Look at the Marek's Disease in chickens. That virus originally had a very low mortality rate, but the widespread use of its leaky vaccine (all the Covid vaccines are also leaky) caused its mortality rate to reach nearly 100% for non-vaccinated chickens.</p>
<p>But so far, all the existing variants seem to be less lethal, since they are more transmissive. Hopefully, it stays that way.</p>

        <p>I blame the CDC's piss fucking poor messaging. The vaccines DO prevent transmission, but when you ARE infected with COVID and are vaccinated your viral loads are the same as someone who never got vaccinated. </p>
<p>But in terms of actual numbers yeah, like 150,000,000 people in the US have the vaccine, there have been a few thousand hospitalizations from that group, and a few dozen deaths. Hardly anything to <em>mandate</em> for. </p>
<p>My issue is that we are apparently just going to kill the economy every fucking time a college student gets the sniffles now. And international travel just <em>isn't</em> a thing I guess now.</p>

        <p>I didn't read the Business Insider article.  I went directly to the CDC page, which is linked in the article.  I'm no professional, but it really does read like there were as many cases among the vaccinated as the unvaccinated.  Its closer than you think, anyway.  I'm willing to be corrected on this, if I read it wrong.</p>
<p>It appears, from this CDC page, that if you're vaccinated, you have lower probability of an extreme case or hospitalization, but that you're almost as likely to generate a viral load in your system, which would lead to your ability to spread it.  Again, I can hardly believe it, but its right there on the CDC page.</p>

        <p>You trust the CDC about the transmission data. But you don’t trust the CDC about vaccine safety 🤔
Transmission is worse among symptomatic cases. Asymptomatic people are not the main spreaders. Unvaccinated people are the ones getting the most sick and spreading the virus most.</p>

        <p>Scientifically speaking, vaccines and mask wearing do reduce transmission and can prevent  symptomatic or severe infection. Viruses aren’t typically a one virus particle = one ICU or death sort of thing. You have to have a certain number in your body to get past the immune system and overwhelm it. If a person wearing a mask has covid, many of the the droplets of spit or can get trapped in the mask fibers. The person with covid isn’t releasing pure dry viruses. They are all trapped in spit/moisture from lungs, nose, etc. </p>
<p>As far as vaccines, they can reduce the number of virus particles being made that can leave the body as the immune system is actively killing infected cells and killing virus particles. So it could be say…10 percent as compared to without the vaccine. Low viral load means less chance of getting someone sick or very sick. It’s the same as getting the flu from someone walking by versus a sick person sneezing directly in your face. One is going to deliver a lot more virus particles and overwhelm you.</p>

        <p>\&rt; The vaccinated can spread the virus just as easily as the non-vaccinated, and it's been proven at this point</p>
<p>Was it, really? Just as easily? So if non-vaccinated person gives the virus to 4.2783565 people on average, vaccinated people would give the virus to the eact same number of people? Or slightly less? Or slightly more? Or exactly 4.2783565? What are the chances of such coincidence that two measurements of different crowds yield the exact same result?</p>
<p>Sorry, I still have not heard any evidence of significance of asymptomatic transmission and vaccinated transmission. Sure, these things are <em>possible</em>. But nobody is telling us exactly how likely they are, because those were scare stories to force us comply. There is literally nobody in the world who got COVID through touching something, but they still push hand sanitizer on us because it is <em>theoretically</em> possible.</p>

        <p>CDC is just lying here. This is written for people like Ted Cruz, who refused to put his mask, saying that since he is vaccinated, so he does not need to mask up. The message is that even though you had two doses you still cannot be openly republican.</p>
<p>All these lies of course will backfire, just like lies about the mask made many people antimaskers. I see antivaxxers backing their decision by 'science' like that, like 'since it doesn't work why do we need to take it?'</p>

<p>"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus," Walensky said. </p>

        <p>Interesting, ive seen so many articles about the covid vaccines actually not being able to reduce covid transmission. Since those who are vaccinated have the same viral load as to those who dont. And i know you linked the CDCs data. But newer data from the UK and Israel say otherwise. Which isnt suprising since the CDC has been proven wrong about a lot of things with new data.</p>

        <p>Yeah thats some what true. The vaccines strong suit is lowering the mortality rate and severity of infection. However in some countries they are seeing that those who are vaccinated are more likely to die from covid, oddly. In America thats not really the case, although its hard to tell since the CDC has stopped reporting most of the breakthrough cases. More data will be coming out so we will see truly whats happening. But there seems to be a trend of more people vaccinated dying than unvaccinated in a lot of countries.</p>
<p>To those who have weakened immune systems and could possibly get severe infections resulting in possible damage. There are several treatments for early infection, like ivermectin and HQC to prevent damages and death from covid. </p>
<p>Overall, with there being many treatments proven to work and the vaccine does a shitty job at reducing transmission. There really is no need to take a risk and get the vaccine. But im ultimately pro choice so if you feel the need to get vaccinated and feel safe, im all for it.</p>
