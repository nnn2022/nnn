    <strong>Why are countries like India so heavily impacted by COVID-19?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m curious as to how this community contextualizes the way India has been impacted by the pandemic.</p>
<p>I won’t pretend to be an expert but information of India’s handling of the virus is readily available. Their government largely downplayed the severity of the virus and people are dying at an alarming rate. </p>
<p>One might speculate that had they taken measures more akin to the “west” they may not be experiencing what they are currently experiencing.</p></p>

        <p>&rt; Their government largely downplayed the severity of the virus and people are dying at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>What is a non alarming rate?</p>
<p>It helps to have some context - </p>
<p>Population = 1.38 billion</p>
<p>1,380,000,000</p>
<p>for comparison - the uk 68 million - 68,000,000 (twenty times smaller)</p>
<p>for comparison - the USA 328 million - 328,000,000 (4 times smaller)</p>
<p>so a lot of people.</p>
<p>A lot of people die every day</p>
<p>We can look at the historical death rates to see how many people die.
We know the total number of deaths. These figures are very hard for governments and media to lie about or manipulate the same way they do Covid deaths.</p>
<p>In India the previous years death rate is 7.3 per 1000 people.</p>
<p>In a country of 1380,000,000 - that gives us 10074000 total deaths in a year.</p>
<p>(That is an average of 22,600 deaths every day)</p>
<p>India - like everywhere else in the world, has seasonal flu. Respiratory viruses appears at regular times every year.</p>
<p>Now - is one of those times.</p>
<p>We know - in an average year - 7% of the total deaths in India are recorded as being caused by respiratory viruses.</p>
<p>7% of 10074000 is 705180</p>
<p>just over 70,000</p>
<p>So this is the historical numbers we would expect without covid.</p>
<p>705180, divided by 365 days in a year, on average 1932 deaths with respiratory viruses every day.</p>
<p>In reality - these viruses are seasonal - the same as UK and America - flu, coughs and colds appear in winter. Disappear in summer. So if we are really only talking about deaths occuring in half a year - and those 705180 deaths were occuring during in a 6 month period, (not evenly spread over the 365 days in a year) a more accurate expectation would be closer to 3862 deaths per day during flu season </p>
<p>So that is our rough expectation, somewhere between 2 and 4 thousand deaths per day. </p>
<p>And what do we see reported in the news?</p>
<p>Exactly what we expect.</p>
<p>That is the context.</p>
<p>Not denying the virus - In most of the world, respiratory virus deaths have been about 10% higher, so I would guess we will see deaths around 2500 per day rising to 4500 per day at the peak.</p>
<p>These numbers look scary - and the newspapers and the media will sensationalise them. But its nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>Lockdowns would kill more people than covid with no lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Would you give any weight to the time between infection and death? Rise in infections has been pretty sharp and deaths will likely follow suit. Especially considering the oxygen shortage.</p>
<p>Or to the fact that testing and reporting mechanisms for either infections or deaths are nowhere near as comprehensive as they are in the US or most of Europe?</p>

<p>Me personally? </p>
<p>No, its not something I give weight to. Because its not relevant to my answer.</p>
<p>The OP asks </p>
<p>"how this community contextualizes the way India has been impacted by the pandemic"</p>
<p>and </p>
<p><strong>and people are dying at an alarming rate.</strong></p>
<p>So I gave the OP some context. Its sad that media often ignores context.  </p>
<p>And pointed out that people are not dying at an alarming rate.</p>

        <p>India has received over 200 million vaccine doses....you would think covid cases would decline gradually....but rather it's been doing the opposite and climbing drastically; their are two options </p>
<p>either the vaccines are not effective ORR</p>
<p>the vaccines are causing the uptick in sickness/death </p>
<p>Whatever the case maybe I don't claim to have all the answers just food for thought ❤️</p>

        <p>Your right it's too early to tell.....but I have a very very strong feeling that in 7-8 months when over a billion have been vaccinated.... covid will still be raging on perhaps even more then before; due to supposed "variants"  and "strains" perhaps only time will tell</p>

        <p>Poor diets and genetic might be a contributing factor, but poor sanitation should make them stronger to these low level pathogens [like flu since covid is very similar to flu] there is something else going on there. Also they should all have sufficient vitamin d levels since it is always sunny there and they are outside a lot more compared to Western people. Maybe they literally just lacked the physical resources to deal with increased sick people coming in with vaccine side effects, covid AND the all the regular hospital visits. But then again wouldn't they have increased their capacity/resources in the past year? So idk...</p>

        <p>Definitely poor sanitation. Explains why African countries, which also have large populations that live in poverty, have done relatively well vs. Covid. </p>
<p>If you believe that the vaccine is to blame, they’re also the most vaccinated country so... the vaccine is either totally useless, or India now has an international embarrassment due to ignoring the large number of their populations living in abject poverty.</p>

        <p>But just because there are vaccines doesn’t mean people utilize the vaccines. US has plenty yet a large portion of the population doesn’t want it.</p>

        <p>Am I? And are they?</p>
<p>By what metric are you concluding that?</p>
<p>I’d hope it isn’t per capita cases, because I am familiar with those numbers. And they look even better when you compare them to other developed countries and excluded those where actual cases are probably significantly higher due to insufficient testing.</p>

        <p>I meant that I’m curious how they contextualize Japan, who does not have a high infection rate. Same for South Korea.</p>

        <p>Simple, Japan is a vaccine sceptic nation that isn't taking this poison much, or even testing extensively with the bogus PCR test except in Tokyo and Osaka to some extent. </p>
<p>They are less brainwashed than the average doomer country.</p>

        <p>I’m no scientist and this may be over simplifying it, but they have a massive population. Social distancing probably isn’t a thing there largely because it’s not possible, for both cultural reasons and because there’s just too many damn people.</p>
<p>They also don’t have the same hygiene practices I would imagine. I know a few people who have been to India (well-travelled people that have been to dozens of countries) and many of them said it was disgusting and they would never go back.</p>

        <p>It's very easy to say anything you want about a country on the fast side of the world but that doesn't mean it's true. They lie about numbers here why wouldn't they lie about other countries numbers?</p>

        <p>Who is they? </p>
<p>There is a myriad of sources and studies indicating under reporting of cases across the globe. Even in the US, as you pointed out yourself.  </p>
<p>While some underreporting my be purposeful, a portion of it is simply because people aren’t tested.</p>
<p>Also, more anecdotally, on a global scale, a country “looks” better when they have less cases. There are clear incentives to underreport.</p>
<p>Why would India, a country whose government denied the severity of the virus, overreport the numbers?</p>
