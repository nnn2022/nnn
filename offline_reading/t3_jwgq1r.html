    <strong>Extremely early Christmas decorating making everything feel more dystopic in 2020. Perhaps an unpopular opinion.</strong>
    <p><p>My neighborhood has been completely decorated since November 1st. Some of my neighbors had their houses decorated and trees up since mid October. This is not usual for my area.</p>
<p>I love Christmas and the feeling behind it, but since I've been starring at Santa across the street since October 15, the feelings just gone. Now my mind can't place the time of year. It looks like it's about two weeks till Christmas, but we haven't even hit Thanksgiving yet. </p>
<p>Now we'll all have to stare at Christmas decoration from October until mid January. If you leave decorations up long enough their no longer associated with a holiday, but rather your normal décor. </p>
<p>Early decorating has been pushed all over social media and the news this year, why? Because if we stare it the things that once made us happy long enough constantly for months, they no longer feel special. </p>
<p>I understand this might be a unpopular opinion, but it just makes 2020 feel weirder to me.</p></p>

        <p>I put up my decorations on Nov 2 lol. Christmas has a always been a magical time for me and I needed some magic in my life. The outside world  is a hell hole, but inside my own home, it’s cozy, inviting, and brings me joy.</p>

        <p>Christmas creep is a thing. The Home Depot near me started selling Christmas stuff since October. Regardless, my wife keeps bugging me to put up the tree and lights earlier every year and I keep telling her not until after Thanksgiving.</p>

        <p>Well there was nice weather and some people don’t find driving stakes into the frozen ground while they slowly freeze to death fun.  Probably has more to do with wfh and weather than anything else.</p>

        <p>So much weather related for us. We did the whole "wait closer to Christmas" last year. We ending up putting decorations up during the beginning of a blizzard because that was the best weather for quite a while.  Yeah, not doing that again. It's been sunny but cold lately. Decorations are going up.</p>

        <p>I agree. My neighbors took down the Halloween decorations and immediately throw up Christmas everything. My neighbors said they put them up November 1st to cheer people up, but you're right looking at the decorations for months will lead to a void of emotional reaction (I already feel that way). Nearly my whole neighborhood is already decorated too and it does give a weird its too early vibe. </p>
<p>Weather here isn't much different than any time after Thanksgiving, I hate that reasoning. It's cause Becky on FB showed her house decorated October 20th so everyone had to rush to out do Becky since it's socially acceptable to decorate for Christmas all year now.</p>

        <p>There is a growing trend to start decorating for Christmas earlier. The rationale is that many people put a lot of time and money into Christmas decorations, and since Thanksgiving doesn't have many strong decorating traditions, it makes more sense to get Christmas decorations up earlier so they can justify all the time and money spent on Christmas decorations and enjoy them longer. There is a trend to start treating Thanksgiving as one of "the holidays" when referring to the holiday season or happy holidays. So in that sense it makes sense to begin decorating for the holidays after Halloween.</p>

        <p>A lot of these decorations are being put up by people who seem to believe that everything will suddenly change once 2020 is over, so who knows what they're doing to do with their decorations in January.</p>

        <p>The reason it's happening is because of people in many countries aren't sure if they're allowed to celebrate Christmas in December because of restrictions, so they does it when they're still allowed.</p>

        <p>I’ve noticed this as well. To be honest, I actually enjoy it. I even put my own up way early because why not. It beats looking at masked faces and Biden Harris signs.</p>
