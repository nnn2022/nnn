    <strong>My Small Private Christian University is Mandating Masks for Unvaccinated Students</strong>
    <p><p>Recently, my university issued a statement explaining their plans for the upcoming semester. Thankfully, they are not mandating the vaccine, but they are certainly contributing to the culture of incentivizing getting the shot. Students who have been vaccinated are not required to wear masks, not required to social distance, not required to quarantine if they come in contact with someone who tests positive for Covid-19. The health department has requested that vaccinated students send in proof of vaccination for "demographic" purposes… Students who have not been vaccinated are required to wear masks, required to social distance, required to quarantine if they come in contact with someone who tests positive for Covid-19. </p>
<p>My issues with this policy are simple: 
a) it promotes segregation and divisiveness on campus - students who are masked will be "othered" as they will undoubtedly stand out like Hester Prynne. Students who are unvaccinated might as well print a big "U" on their masks so that there is no confusion.
b) it parades students' private health decisions to the wider public - masked students will automatically be presumed to be unvaccinated. Good for the vaccinated who decide to share their status on social media and bring it up in every conversation, but at the end of the day, they've shared because they want to. Not because it's required. No one deserves to have others assume, scrutinize, or question their private health information. 
c) it's drenched in hypocrisy - the irony of this whole policy is that just last school year the theme on campus was "better together." In no way does this promote togetherness within the student body. In addition to be contradictory on that level, I'm not entirely following the science of vaccinated students not needing to take any means of preventative care measures should they potentially contract the virus while those who are not must quarantine. If the vaccine does its job as a vaccine, who is this protecting?
Additionally, this policy - like most - makes no account of students who have been naturally vaccinated through contracting and recovering from the virus. Science has always supported the value of natural immunity and more and more research is establishing its value in the case of Covid-19.</p>
<p>I am not sure how they plan to enforce this policy unless all staff maintain a working knowledge of who is and who isn't vaccinated. Assuming this will not be the case, they will likely have faith in the students to be honest and adhere to these guidelines. I feel the most practical policy to implement is one that recommends CDC guidelines but declares masks optional. This eliminates the segregationist implications behind the current policy and trusts the students to do what's best for their health without policing, demonizing, or babying them.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.</p></p>

        <p>Dude look listen to me.. I know this sounds crazy but I've realized it cause I have the same "policy" at work.. ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO ENFORCE! Just Incase anyone asks just say it's none of their business or just lie lol I feel bad about it, but i have legitimate concerns about getting the shot, I'm actually fucking terrified of it.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't care for this policy in any case, but it's especially unethical to just announce this policy now.</p>
<p>It takes 5 weeks to become fully vaccinated. If they were going to have this policy, they should have announced it at least 7 or 8 weeks before the school year began. Give people time to know about this policy and get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>You can't. Sharing your medical status with them means you have submitted to their medical authority over you.</p>
<p>Since they have no right to ask in the first place (outside an actual emergency) by answering you're recognizing their request as legitimate.</p>

        <p>Looks like you got it all understood.</p>
<p>You seem to be missing a key component though... your rights to govern your own body, and to maintain your medical status between you and your doctor?</p>
<p>The school has no medical authority over you unless you and other students grant it, either by filling out paperwork, wearing a Mask, etc</p>
<p>The school knows this, that is why it is 'requesting' and not demanding compliance.</p>
<p>You have a decision to make for yourself I guess.</p>
