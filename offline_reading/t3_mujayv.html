        <p>I think the real question is why taking it against the virus with 99+% survival rate?</p>
<p>Even if it's perfectly save, I don't want to take it, I don't need any extra protection against this virus.</p>

        <p>You take it because Covid is 5-10 times more deadly than the seasonal flu and extra protection is warranted. In Brazil there are 4,000 people dying per day of Covid and being buried in mass graves. 
Go there and tell them not worry because there's a 99% survival rate.</p>

        <p>But you don't take the vaccin for yourself, but for group immunity (is that even an english word? Not my first language obviously). While you might survive covid just fine, you might make someone else very sick because of it. Is it not a bit selfish to think about it as only for yourself? As long as the danger of those people dying exists, the country is not gonna open up again. I want to go out again, see my friends again, but it is not gonna be faster with your mentality.</p>

        <p>And actually I was sarcastic :)</p>
<p>No, I heard these arguments thousands of times before you, it contradicts all medical science we previously knew and doesn't make any sense. The only science behind this is behaviorism, which is manipulating people to take irrational decisions.</p>
<p>And if it's not enough they use another "science" to convince you.</p>

        <p>Ah well then enjoy your bubble. But doesn't your first comment contradict your own logic? In the case of the vacc being totally safe, and having a chance of saving people such as myself, then whats keeping you from taking it? Doesnt sound irrational to me</p>

But wht would you not listen to science, but rather to aunt liz from facebook who just wrote a beautiful paragraph on her son who died in a car accident after taking the flu shot?</p>

<li>Haven't been on Discord either.</li>
<li>How does the virus get eradicated if you can still transmit and contract it EVEN if fully vaccinated? How does that happen?</li>
<li>I agree.. but all of those other vaxxes are not designed to be leaky. Leaky vaxxes are DESIGNED to not prevent transmission/contraction.</li>
<li>I noticed that you said that Eng was not your native language? If you can speak German, French or Spanish, we can continue this in a way that is easier for you to understand. (I am not trying to be condescending, I just want to make sure that we are understanding each other fully.)</li>

2 i am far from an expert from this, i believe it had something to do with survivalrate of the virus or some shit idk
3 but can't this vaccine work if others have worked in the past? I dont really know a lot about this, it just sounds right to me

        <p>- "This is why you shouldn't believe something just because an expert or person with a degree says it"</p>
<p>I don't, but when several million experts in multiple countries say it I listen.</p>
<p>- "Yet, that's what has lead to all of the fearmongering and measures that have provided zero benefit to slowing spread or reducing deaths"</p>
<p>Yeah but 90% of Americans wear masks, so you can't rightly say it provided no benefit because you don't know what the situation would be if they did not.We know that the virus spreads via respiratory droplets and aerosols. Wearing face covering reduces the amount of droplets that make it past your mouth. Completely logical.</p>
<p>My government has given people a lot of freedom to govern themselves throughout this whole thing, but for all those who are abiding by the rules there are dozens more ignoring them, hosting private parties and generally being irresponsible. The P1 variant is spreading here and the ICUs here are filling up. Triage nurses will soon have to make decisions about who lives and who dies.</p>
<p>I don't agree with calling it fear mongering when there's a catastrophe unfolding around me. I wish more people were scared, instead people here are having beach parties and shit.</p>

        <p>&rt;Yeah but 90% of Americans wear masks, so you can't rightly say it provided no benefit because you don't know what the situation would be if they did not.</p>
<p>I know because Covid is airborne.  It's aerodolized and nothing short of an N-95 mask significantly reduces the spread.  Outside air ventilation provides some benefit, but cloth and paper masks are largely worthless.  That's why policy for us healthcare providers is to wear N-95s in Covid patient rooms.</p>
<p>Sources:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/m20-6817">Danish Mask Study</a></p>
<p><a href="https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-10-28/a-room-a-bar-and-a-class-how-the-coronavirus-is-spread-through-the-air.html">Aeorsol Spread</a></p>
<p>It's not fear mongering if it really is a catastrophe.  The catastrophe of Covid is how many people didn't go to the hospital for treatable conditions because they were afraid they'd catch Covid, or mistakenly thought they weren't supposed to go to the hospital if sick.</p>
<p>My wife saw this first hand when an unresponsive man was brought into her hospital ED.  He had a severe GI bleed and regained consciousness after getting blood products.  Then he checked out AMA because he was "afraid of getting Covid".  That was the actual reason on the AMA form.  This case and others became part of Covid training for area hospitals.</p>
<p>I've seen more sources than I can post here for reasons of writing space and confidentiality.  They make me firmly conclude that if we had not shutdown, not mandated masks, or the media hadn't instilled panic there would have been significantly fewer deaths in 2020.</p>
<p>I understand if you disagree.  You may not have had access to see what I have.  I treat experts as trust but verify.  Mainly because I have the education, resources and professional experience to analyze the data and understand the implications of studies.
That's not always easy for the general public to do.</p>
<p>Remember though, it's not really a consensus if you censor those who disagree.</p>

        <p>Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is put into effect to ensure that potentially lifesaving medical products could be made available during an emergency before being approved by the FDA, if
no formally approved alternatives are available at the time; or if sufficient supplies of formally approved products are not available. EUA was used during 9/11, H1N1 and it is being used now.
A vaccine must demonstrate clear and compelling effectiveness in a large Phase 3 clinical trial in order to qualify. </p>
<p>The lack of FDA approval on Covid vaccines is frequently brought up as a sinister talking point on here, but I don't personally believe FDA approval would make any difference whatsoever to the individuals on this sub who subscribe to global conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>You mean like the vaccines which are not FDA-approved for any use outside an emergency? How intellectually disingenuous of you.</p>

        <p>The vaccines are authorized for use by the FDA, they have been evaluated by the FDA and met their standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization; and they are intended to prevent disease. 
So no, not like that at all. </p>
<p>Seeing as how they were developed specifically because of an emergency, I doubt anyone is immediately concerned about their approved use outside of an emergency.</p>

        <p>The only reason that they received EUA is because there was systematic censorship of cheap and effective drugs and vitamins like ivermectin, doxycycline, azithromycin, HCQ, vit D3, etc. If they weren't suppressed, the Phase III trial therapies would never have been allowed to be injected into human beings.</p>

        <p>Cool, now apply your method of critical thinking to debunk another doctor...</p>
<p>Let's just pick some random guy, let say Fauci.</p>
<p>Just for the sake of "pure scientific experiment", you know, "thesis + antithesis =synthesis".</p>
<p>As for me, I don't care if any of these injections are safe or not, I don't need any extra protection against this virus. Again, this specific virus, not all the viruses and diseases ever existed in the world.</p>

        <p>I don't honestly pay a ton of attention to Fauci.
I know in the past he has faced some criticism over mistakes he made, and the fact that he backtracked on some of his own mask recommendations. 
Aside from that, I'm not immediately aware of any misinformation or falsehoods recently attributed with him. Was there anything in particular you had in mind?</p>

        <p>Don't pay a ton of attention to Fauci?</p>
<p>It's like being a conspiracy theorist that doesn't pay attention to David Icke or Alex Johns :)</p>
<p>Or being a national-socialist without paying attention to the guy named Adolf :)</p>
<p>As for "mistakes" he made.</p>
<p>We're all are just human, and can make mistakes. It's fine, you make mistake, the reality proves you wrong, you admit it, apologize, and then it depends. If your mistake didn't harm anyone, you're trying to fix it, and never ever repeat it again. If people died because of it, you need to be investigated and criminally prosecuted, and it's up to the court to decide, what would be your future...</p>
<p>Anyway, it's not a case with the guy you don't pay attention to.....</p>
<p>He's just a lair, and continue to propagate very dangerous agenda ignoring all evidences that prove him wrong.</p>
<p>Again, I don't now what's the situation with you......</p>
<p>For some reason I doubt that you're just a naive person who accidentally didn't notice anything wrong with this world in last 2 years. Like the reality where you can be arrested for just going outside and breathing the air....</p>
<p>But just in case you missed it look at this</p>

<p>This is the reality we live in, and it was created in order to "protect us" from virus with very high survival rate.</p>
<p>Sure, you're smart enough to ask yourself a questions, and find the answers.</p>
<p>You don't need me, you have the whole sub dedicated to this, and some part of the internet that wasn't censored yet.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
