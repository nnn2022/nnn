<p>These are unprecedented times hopefully we have the patience to get back to normal without the new normal becoming the normal normal.</p>
<p>Since this started we’ve needed to get back to normal because the new normal is unprecedented almost always.</p>
<p>Once things get back to normal, hopefully, the new normal is not unprecedented.</p>
<p>We're in this together even when we’re apart, social distancing, while the doors are still closed and the distance between us has gotten bigger, seriously.</p>
<p>We'll get through these trying times that are unprecedented times and the new normal because we’re in this together, 6ft apart.</p>
<p>The new normal is almost always unprecedented times, which is why we understand now more than ever that this is poor timing, and we’re here to help.</p>
<p>We've always been there for our customers and we always will be, almost always</p>
<p>Even now when we weigh the news, the economy, and up to date number of cases, we still find ways to stay close while apart, but united. </p>
<p>Now more than ever front line workers keeping us running while the doors are still closed and while the distance between us has gotten bigger, we thank you.</p>
<p>In these times of uncertainty, the new normal is unprecedented, according to the experts, so we’re here to help, almost always.</p>
<p>While the doors are still closed, the economy is here for you, slightly apart, but united.</p>
<p>While the distance between us has gotten bigger, we’re here for you, now more than ever.</p>
<p>Hope you’re doing well, being safe, keeping healthy, and staying connected while we flatten the curve. </p>

<p>We still find ways to stay close, bravely socially distanced, we’re here for you</p>
<p>Without leaving the safety of your home, federal officials will be six feet apart, even while the doors are still closed.</p>
<p>Here to help you stay socially distanced while our front-line workers face unprecedented new normal times.</p>

<p>We'll come out the other side of this stronger once things get back to normal</p>
<p>These are unprecedented times and although timing is poor, these are not the best of times.</p>
<p>Once things get back to normal, we’ll always be here for you during these challenging times.</p>
<p>It’s been incredibly up-to-date self-quarantining apart but united</p>

<p>Even now we’re here to help CDC officials get through this together </p>
<p>Hope this reaches the caring frontline workers normally timing is poor </p>
