        <p>They clearly don't want to teach them. In all likelihood they don't even like your children. And probably don't like you.</p>
<p>Yesterday this same union posted a now deleted tweet which read:</p>
<p>&rt;"The push to reopen schools is rooted in sexism, racism and misogyny."</p>

        <p>A lot of common core is actually really good. The way that the courses interlink and support each other, and the math is actually great. Implementation and rollout are what killed it, but the concept is actually pretty good. Most people complaining that they couldn't do the "new math" probably couldn't really do the "old math" either</p>

        <p>You're kidding, right? Common core takes the autonomy out of teaching and the government LITERALLY tells you how /what to teach. The standards are entirely too high for students' developmental levels. It's sad. I truly believe these insane standards leads to depression/anxiety/behavior disorders in kids.</p>

        <p>Said in another thread but with the tiny amount of ''in person'', we have for my family:</p>
<p>"[we have to] take their stuff from the backpack  and switch it for identical stuff to 'quarantine it', they make the kids  mask up and carry sanitizer (provided by me), rigerous distancing and  p[plexiglass all over the school, teachers wearing ridiculous amounts of  dystopian PPE and the creme de la creepy--</p>
<p>The <strong>school  called to verify that my family hadnt had thanksgiving dinner with  outside people. they reminded us that if we had outside family near us  for the holiday the kids cant go back for a week and collected everyones  answers on this.</strong></p>
<p>Also  every day I have to submit a survery stating theres no fever, all the  standard questions about the ki and everyone in the household. If i  forget this or its late I get like 4 phone calls from panicked teachers  and office staff...8 different bosses bob... to freak out and make sure I  ddint send the sleeping death to school on my kid."</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Its a constant guilt/fear conversation between us and the school and the teachers are such victims about it. its really..really shitty and hasnt been much less extra work than online. and online was hell. My kids in preschool.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Their emails have changed from "hopefully for the higher grades hybrid learning can begin in ___month" (hybrid not even full in person) the most recent one said <strong>SOMETIME IN 2021.</strong></p>

        <p>The sad part is those that are in good with their unions usually are the ones behind political agendas that have nothing to do with teaching children. They will be protected, and the outliers let go.</p>
<p>Evaluate and focus on your local districts and then make your decision. You'd be surprised that not all unions are like this...and the ones that are have a lot of teachers that don't align with their agenda.</p>
