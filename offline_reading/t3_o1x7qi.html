    <strong>Isn't the delta variant a good development?</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/17/covid-delta-variant-symptoms-spread-and-what-to-look-out-for.html</p>
<p>i don't understand the framing around the delta variant as though it's a bad thing just because it's more transmissible. we know that a virus evolves to be more transmissible because that's how viruses work.</p>
<p>this article states:
&rt; WHO officials said Wednesday there were reports that the delta variant also causes more severe symptoms, but that <em>more research is needed to confirm those conclusions.</em></p>
<p>in my opinion until there is data on this i'm not taking "WHO officials said there were reports" to mean anything at all. the rest of the article (echoing the same as another article i read last week) goes on to say that it presents as basically a cold.</p>
<p>&rt; Throughout the pandemic, governments around the world have warned that the main symptoms of Covid-19 are a fever, persistent cough and loss of taste or smell with some domestic variations and additions as we’ve learned more about the virus.</p>
<p>&rt; “Covid is also acting differently now,” Spector noted in a YouTube briefing last week. “It’s more like a bad cold in this younger population and people don’t realize that and that hasn’t come across in any of the government information.”</p>
<p>&rt; “Since the start of May, we have been looking at the top symptoms in the app users and they are not the same as they were,” he said. “The number one symptom is headache, then followed by sore throat, runny nose and fever.” More “traditional” Covid symptoms such as a cough and loss of smell were much rarer now he said, with younger people experiencing much more of a bad cold or “funny off feeling.”</p>
<p>putting aside the fact that for a lot of people, the original "alpha variant" presented as a mild cold or flu in the first place... the virus is becoming more transmissible but these symptoms described are LESS severe. i think this is great news and i don't understand the doomsday framing when it seems like covid is just going to join the rotation of the thousands of cold viruses that circulate every year. we don't care about vaccinating against a cold because it's not worth the effort to prevent something so mild and they evolve into variants quickly by their nature anyway.</p>
<p>this was the natural path for the virus to take and it's acting very predictably if my understanding of viruses is correct. what do you think? am i wrong?</p></p>

<p>More bullshit that will never be proven, and then ignored when the next narrative is achieved.</p>
<p>28 trials showing the effectiveness of Ivermectin... "we need more research before we make a decision"</p>
<p>Same with Vitamin D3, or really anything shown to be effective.</p>
<p>They are fucking gaslighting everyone.</p>

        <p>Yep, it is. More transmissible means less deadly. The natural evolution into a mild cold.</p>

        <p>I think some people want this to be bigger than it is. I bought in to the initial hysteria myself. It was a novel virus we didn't know anything.</p>
<p>Now that we have had ample time to study this novel virus. Literally nothing has changed so we were 100% right in the beginning. This is a world ending catastrophe. We must lock down forever or else literally billions of people will die. </p>
<p>It looks to me like a lot of fucking bullshit. If the <em>"experts"</em> had all this time why are we still just as clueless as a year ago. The experts are a fucking joke.</p>
<p>My proof of the scam is the several very public facing essential businesses did not collapse.</p>

        <p>Colds are going to do what colds do. I got it in December, was just a cough for me. I would personally take covid over the flu any day. The flu put me in bed for a day and made me throw up last time. I could have believed covid was just an allergy day.</p>

        <p>It's a leaky vaccine - so we may just end up running out of Greek letters.</p>
<p>Well-enough people to socialise will be spreading it far - and every slightly ill person will be making slightly mutated virions.</p>

        <p>I've seen this happen for over the past 900 years, two world wars, an assassination of a Greek leader, civil war in 5 super power countries, "natural" disasters, and of course this time it's another disease (covid) like back in 1912 except they screw it up and ended up killing more people than they meant to...what I'm gettin at is tht it seems these events are always preceded by a new leader coming into power or used to remove someone they didn't like in power, to keep certain businesses afloat, restrict resources for a time, in 1940's during ww2 it was steel, this time it was gas. I can keep giving u examples but I'm sure I'll get the same responses "u don't know shit" or "definitely a trump/biden supporter", and my personal favorite "go fu%&amp; yourself psycho"...</p>
