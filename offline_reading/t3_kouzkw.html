        <p>Lockdowns were not the only reason for increase. </p>
<p>Certain policies caused by a certain political movement are also to blame. In fact the article specifically mentioned the spike after summer.</p>

        <p>Here in NYC, something unspoken was that the lockdowns were mostly enforced in middle class and upper class neighborhoods. Totally unenforced in the poorer neighborhoods that have most of the violence. During the pandemic, there have been tons of bars/restaurants operating illegally in Black-majority parts of Brooklyn and the Bronx without issue, while Staten Island (only Republican leaning part of the City) has been hit hard by NYPD raids of businesses that remained open. So it’s not shocking that the stay-at-home orders did nothing to curb violence. Gangbangers were out the entire time. This is really political and all about getting back at “MAGA-America” more than controlling any virus.</p>

<p>When all law-abiding citizens stay home, you know who's outside?</p>
<p>Way to give criminals free range of anywhere there is lockdown enforcement.</p>

        <p>Another issue is that some jurisdictions let out lots of inmates early due to covid.  Many were involved in gangs, at least in CA.  Yet, this is a time of record unemployment.  So, what exactly were all of these people supposed to do to keep a roof over their heads?  They don’t qualify for unemployment.  Their families may be unemployed and struggling themselves.  It’s difficult for ex-felons to get hired in good times.  There was no chance for most of them to stay out of trouble.  Most of them probably returned to their old lives, but now there is a surplus, so they are feuding with rivals more.</p>

        <p>I wonder why the article doesn't mention Philly? We've had 500 murders in 2020 and 3 within the first 5 hours of 2021.</p>

        <p>Wow, I didn't realize that Phili was so bad. But I'm from Chicago and we still "lead the pack" with close to 800 homicides. The most since the crack cocaine 90's era. Our Mayor will probably blame the gun violence on Covid. lol</p>

        <p>I feel for you guys out in Chicago!  Here..it's kinda just normalized. I was just surprised we weren't mentioned at all when we would've been 2nd place! Chicago,  Philly and New York needs big time help. Here in Philly...started the year off with 3 murders in the first 5 hours! Lol. Complete madness. I really hope these cities can get it together and fix this. It's insane.</p>
