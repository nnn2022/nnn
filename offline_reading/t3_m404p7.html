    <strong>Reposted rant because I genuinely don't know what to do re: excommunication from family</strong>
    <p><p>That's it, I've tried my very damndest to get my folks/wider family to, if not see that this isn't the next Black Plague, to at the very least, not to sacrifice themselves to their god of big pharma/government by playing Russian Roulette with their lives, but to no avail. In fact, there's a not-zero chance that they'll disown me for my "conspiracies" and "selfishness" in the coming year(s).</p>
<p>I already burned a lot of bridges by both being one of the original Obama haters (WAY before it was cool, mind you) and my measured defenses of Orange Emmanuel Goldstein and suggesting that the "deplorables" may not all be marauding, inbred Klansmen. Saying what I REALLY think of Big Sis Kamala could very well be the straw that breaks the camel's back, IDK.</p>
<p>Even my dad, the one individual I'd considered more levelheaded and reasonable, encouraged by his stupid fucking "friends" I'm sure, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DDXG-dHugc">literally became this guy</a> after a funeral. I don't even need to say what they claim his friend died of, because you and I already fucking know.</p>
<p>The point is NOTHING I could say or show them at this point would work or even make a dent in their Mockingbird-induced stupor. My cousin literally comes to visit us muzzled. She's fucking 30! These people seriously believe that they're saving lives and that those "anti-maskers/vaxxers" are literal murderers.</p>
<p>Ironically, the one person I've bitched about a lot here (and there are problems with him, for sure) I'm not overly worried about is my little brother. HE was actually the one who started talking about big pharma carrying out mass human experimentation even before I did and when I described the fundamentals of the Great Reset (literal serfdom for the 21st century and beyond), he was horrified by it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel like I'm one of those passengers in first class on the Titanic surrounded by people who don't give a fuck that the plebs are already drowning while our feet are already wet. When I bring up this fact, they just come back with bullshit about how "the experts" say the ship is "unsinkable." At this point, I feel like I can't really do anything else but shake my brother's hand, wish him godspeed, and try to save myself.</p>
<p>Thanks for hearing me out. I know a lot of others are having similar problems. What did you do, if anything, that worked?</p></p>

        <p>good rant</p>
<p>experts are wrong all the time, every time, in fact, when it comes to their prognostications about the bogus ass covid. they have yet to be correct on any point.</p>
<p>the weatherman is an 'expert', isn't he? and armed with the latest tech and data, how many times is he wrong?</p>
<p>as for 'excommunicated', fuck it. that's on them, their loss (and yours in some ways) and a gain for you in other ways, as yet unseen.</p>
<p>i would tell any doomers that we each do our own thing for the next year and then check back... they can comply and obey and i won't. just like last last year.</p>

<p>I keep trying to explain that to them, but to no avail. The "smart" people on the magic box say so, so we have to tRuSt ThE eXpErTs, GrAnNy KiLleR!</p>
<p>I never appreciated just how powerful a factor appeal to authority could be until recently. I mean, I always knew it, but never really appreciated it.</p>

<p>Pretty much my entire life, I've had issues with anxiety. There were even points where I couldn't/wouldn't leave the house or face strangers. However, I never ONCE threw a year-long tantrum and demanded (with the full support of TPTB, mind you) that the world cater to my neuroses, let alone act like it was somehow virtuous for so doing. Fuck state-mandated hypochondria. I get enough of that from my own psyche.</p>
<p>So, thank you for that.</p>

        <p>Try to make community where you can. You are by no means alone in your experience and hopefully NNN folks can ban together in these times. All you can do is make your own choices. You can tell people the truth, but it's their choice to engage it. I'm sorry for the upset this has all caused. I hope you are finding ways to make meaning through all of this.</p>

        <p>&rt;What did you do, if anything, that worked?</p>
<p>As far as convincing people not to live in fear? Nothing. You can quote IFRs and show the lack of correlation between mask mandates and cases all day long, but in the back of their mind they have some article they saw posted on Facebook about how a totally healthy all-star athlete 16 year old got COVID and died, and that's all that matters to them.</p>
<p>As far as my mental health, r/maskskepticism (RIP), r/nonewnormal, r/lockdownskepticism, and r/coronaviruscirclejerk have been a huge help. Being able to vent, make memes, and have an escape from the insanity of the doomers is like a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Try not to burn bridges with your family over this. I think we've all had strained relations with family members who are giving us glares every time we walk into somewhere without a mask or with our masks below our noses, but it's still worthwhile to preserve those relationships.</p>
