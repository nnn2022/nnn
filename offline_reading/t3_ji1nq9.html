    <strong>Non Essential Products</strong>
    <p><p>This is absolutely and totally ridiculous, why are people putting up with such BS? This just isn‚Äôt happening in Wales, Ireland is starting to do it as well. <br>
I live in Japan and have been noticing the same for a few months now, but thought it was just plastic covering over products because they thought it protects from the virus. But nope, they are covered so we can‚Äôt buy them. I tried yesterday and was refused, told I can not buy covered items because those items are things people don‚Äôt need right now.  I tried arguing saying that is just ridiculous and I need some socks ‚Äúwhich is what I wanted to buy‚Äù but no luck. <br>
I finally just got pissed off, ripped off the plastic and grabbed 2 packs of socks and tried to pay for them. They refused my cash, I made it clear that they are refusing to accept my currency when I am offering to pay for the items at hand. They still refused, so I said fine.. I tried!  Then I walked out with the socks.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm sure they called the police, but I was already gone and jumped on a train to go home. <br>
Japan is pretty much open with things slowly going back to normal, despite everyone in mask and some stores taking temperature still. ‚ÄúEspecially the Apple store where they take all your info and only allow a few people to enter‚Äù  So it makes no sense for some stores to all of a sudden start covering products and refusing us to purchase them. If they did this back in March and April it would sorta make sense.. Well not really but at least back then they claimed numerous cases.  </p>
<p>The thing is this is slowly going to happen worldwide as part of their plan. They want to restrict what we can buy so people start purchasing online more from places like Amazon. This way, paper cash is not used and small businesses lose customers and shut down.  They want to remove our currency and make a one world digital currency, which is why they claim paper money can spread Covid üòÇ Yet, wait a minute.... Store recipes, bags and them touching your products don‚Äôt spread it?! üòí</p>
<p>We the people should not stand for this, actually we should NOT stand for any of their ridiculous  retrictions they are pushing upon us. The elites and governments are fighting dirty and they are using force against us. Police have attacked, physically abused and arrested protestors and those going against their bull shit rules. Don‚Äôt wear a mask, don‚Äôt follow rules.. Okay, we‚Äòll fine you and make you pay... </p>
<p>Enough is enough, we need to get physical and violent back. Peaceful protest do nothing when police come and start pushing and hitting people forcing them to leave.  We need to be smart, organize, plan and gather in massive groups to go against all this crap.   </p>
<p>I say, gather in groups of 50 or more and one or two walk into a store trying to buy what they claim are non essential items. If the store refuses, explain that by them refusing they are losing business and will not be making much money. Explain that it is ludicrous they refuse to sell items people want. If they still refuse, everyone walks in and removes barriers and plastics blocking items. Grabs what they want and all go to the registers at once. If they still refuse, take the items and leave.   </p>
<p>We must ALL stand up together to fight this crap back, in large groups others around get nervous and scared and will back down. Police can‚Äôt do much if large amounts of people all walk into stores pulling shit down and going against these restriction. The more people start doing it, the more they have to back down. If they then make restrictions worse, then we need to become much more worse as well.</p>
<p>It truly is time we fight back hard or we are fucked and they win.</p>

        <p>What are you talking about? This is the free world, where daddy government knows better than you do about what you need. And daddy science says that buying something you <em>want</em> causes covid. Unless you buy it from father Amazon. Be happy they tell you how to think, making decisions for yourself is hard!

        <p>Their store, their rules. You don't want to follow their rules, stay out of their store.</p>
<p>You can't just say you don't like their rules so you'll steal. You're just making excuses to steal stuff, and they're not, I'm guessing, going to go over well in court if you keep it up.</p>

        <p>No, it's someone stealing. </p>
<p>The business has a rule. Like their other rules for customer behaviour/attire, like, say, you have to wear pants or shoes. Those are from the government too. They're health codes. </p>
<p>The store saying you can't shop naked is not "the government forcing a business not to sell someone something...." and not an excuse to steal shit.</p>
