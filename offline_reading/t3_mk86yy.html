    <strong>How Are You All Coping With All This Bs Nonsense?</strong>
    <p><p>I live in liberal Canada, and Ontario has announced 1 month full lockdown. Everything is literally closed, and even if you want to go to Dollerrama, you have to wait in a huge line. Yes. Even for simple tasks such as that.</p>
<p>And also, living in liberal Canada, guess what this means? I'm surrounded by foolish, sjw idiots who think the government is actually helping us, while these people's happiness is only found in quadmasking and dictating others to put their masks on. It gets them off.</p>
<p>Sadly, I cannot do anything to implement a change. I can go in protests with fellow sane people, not mask and what not. But, this cannot implement change on a bigger scale. Sadly, Ontario is filled with doomers and these people are just too much and idiotic. But how is everyone passing their days? It truly sucks that these "free" countries are no less than Nazi Germany. </p>
<p>If you don't wear a mask, you are simply cancelled. Like... and it's starting to F up people's mental health, same with Mine. I overthink too much about the future which causes Me headache and distress. I'm far too young for all this shi, and in a way (metaphorically) before My life has started, it has ended.</p>
<p>Day by day as we "progress" more control, more freedoms will be taken away, economy will be destroyed, more this and that and because I'm so "woke" (not the liberal woke) it's truly a disaster on My mental health by keep overthinking this shi. And sadly, even if I try not to, this keeps on bothering Me as I'm surrounded by foolish, liberal clown, doomers who are as we all know just plain idiots and don't know the truth.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, I'm in Cali too, and it's is seriously fucking frustrating.  I'm in Chico which is not as bad as some places (I hear the Bay is hard core)... The number of stores that say anything at all when I walk in without the mask is definitely decreasing a bit though, which is at least encouraging!</p>

        <p>I am moving back home near my family. I work in the live entertainment industry and lost a great deal in 2020. I am selling my home and moving back towards my family and trying to get dopamine from pure, natural sources, not booze and weed. Hard work and family. Time to return to your roots if you are blessed enough to have them available to you. Happy Easter and good luck to all of you.</p>

        <p>Fuck man I understand everything you're saying. I live in Vancouver however but the majority of people here share the same attitudes and a lot of them are actually from ontario😆. Just remember that the same people who preach their retarded sjw values are the same people who make self exemptions to go skiing and travel and only keep their distance from others when it is convenient to them. They are merely keeping up this facade of "doing their part" in fear of being judged by those around them. One of the words I have heard a lot in the last year is "optics." When you boil it down, that's all that left wing liberals actually care about, being seen by others as somebody who is doing their part. Fuck your optics you fake cunts put your money where your mouth is.</p>

        <p>Not everything is as it appears.  Many more people are with us than you think.  There will be a backlash.  Not soon.  Probably in a few decades is my best guess.  Things will get a lot worse before we have a chance to make our move.</p>

        <p>Same. I legit don't care anymore and don't have too much to live for. I would NEVER  want to have children in today's day and age. Not because I don't desire them but rather, I don't want them to suffer in this clownery. All these random vaccines will be mandatory to take, And I cannot dare see My children being brainwashed and manipulated by these liberal SJW clowns. F them. And I dont effing trust this Bs government. F them too.</p>
<p>So marriage and kids are off the table for Me. I guess My purpose in this life was to fight till the end and die early and go with a bang.</p>

        <p>Same. It's not because I can't get married. I can get married, but when the whole world is screwed anyways, what's the point even? And My kids? Everyone Must understand here that, 10 years from now, we are DONE. Yes. And say we got married in couple years, Our children are screwed and done for. Just look at this crazy Gen Z. They are all retarded, and the kids growing up in this mask era, I truly feel bad for them. There mental, social health and what not, they are done for. And these people? They still think we are "progressing." My effing as* No we are NOT. You have destroyed morals, ethics, freedom and everything for your clownery. This world is DONE for. Sadly, I as a common man cannot make a change but I will fight till the end. No matter what.</p>
<p>Heck, just in 1 year the whole world has changed (for the worst) think about it in 5 years if we have kids. It will change like no tomorrow, and sadly, our kids will be brainwashed, required to take all this nonsense and whatnot. Crazy. And yet, still they call this "free" country.</p>
<p>So, what's the wise decision? Don't have kids and save your imaginary kids from all the suffer and they will thank Us on the Day of Judgement. And people like Me and you? Idc if I die today. I don't fear death. At all. I have nothing to lose. But, I rather die with My spine, than bowing down to anyone. There's nothing to live for anyway. This is just straight up truth and reality.</p>

        <p>I'm in Chicago, we are fairly open by comparison to other places so it's mostly ok.  The only significant thing remaining for my lifestyle is full reopening of places like museums, galleries, theater, sports.  </p>
<p>Biggest issue I have is schools are not fully open. I sont have kids of my own but my nieces and nephews are suffering. </p>
<p>As time goes on, my friends and family are coming out of the woodwork. Some dove right in and are frequenting all the things they normal do, some have just dipped a toe in so far.  But almost all have done <em>something</em> outside the home and/or with others</p>

        <p>I'm also from Ontario and I just attempt to ignore the lockdown as best as I can. During the winter one I did outdoor skating and now that the weather has warmed up I'm going to bike and paddle more (I think I'll have to wait a bit for the paddling, but hopefully, not too long). I do yoga and weights workouts at home and read tons of books. I'm also still working since I'm self-employed and work virtually. Basically, I just try to distract myself and avoid looking at the helmet-headed posts on mainstream subs, although I sometimes fall into the trap of looking at them. I go to stores only when I really need something so I don't have to wear my bandanna, which I'm using as a mask, very often.</p>

        <p>I live on Maryland, it's not SO bad, but these double masking virtue signaling people in Silver Spring area, Jesus they are insufferable. But, this year has actually turned out great for us. We found ALL new places to play at, we've made a lot of new friends, we play maskless and unvaccinated(just covid I mean, we have all our other shots of course). We bought an inflatable kayak and gone on the water, etc. We also have 5 kids so even if we can't play with others, they can play together. Hang in there, use your imagination, get outside, hugs ❤️</p>

        <p>I just came back to Onterrible from The Holy Land of Florida since March 29. I wouldn't lie I was crying for a few days going back into lockdown and having everything closed. I guess what keeps me going is majority of my family and friends are in this province. I'd be lying if I said I'm not considering of moving to the USA because it's looking mightly attractive being down there.</p>

        <p>I'm not religious at all anymore, but I looked into a Unitarian church. What a joke! Still ZOOM only and so "woke" that it's embarrassing. Pretty sure all the regular churches here mandate masks. It's very Catholic here. I was raised Free Will Baptist. Not even sure I could find one of those here, but that would probably be the most normal one, which just adds to my cognitive dissonance 🤣</p>

        <p>The church I went to was non denominational, very positive and welcoming and a lot of us didn’t wear masks. The pastor even shook my hand after the service when I was  there and said “I thought I recognized your face.” With a huge smile.</p>
<p>You know where I live even though I’m not sharing it with the class because I don’t trust the audience, but I thought that was cool. Obviously he didn’t care.</p>

<p>You probably hate SJWs because of their cult of victimhood, and here you go, you wrote 5 paragraphs of victimhood yourself, a little sobstory how pink-haired SJWs have ruined your life beyond repair. What next, you gonna ask for a therapist and reparations, like they do?</p>

        <p>Conservatives are part of the problem. Actually, isn't Doug Ford one of them? They have this special state of mind when they get off at the thought of their values being shit on. This is worse than victimhood, this is something up BDSM alley. I think most of them have a 'please sleep with my wife' fetish.</p>
<p>You wrote several paragraphs about how Canada is not a free country. If this is true(which it partly is) people in the streets would never tell you what they really think. Of course everybody in Canada is third-wave feminist who is against climate change, if you walk up to them and ask that. I am too, if you ask me at work.
