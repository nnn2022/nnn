    <strong>Government v*ccine distribution</strong>
    <p><p>It’s almost comical watching local, state and federal governments scrambling around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to figure out how to get more people v<em>ccinated. If only they realized all they have to do is look in a mirror and realize that they themselves are the actual problem. The government is so disconnected with the people they serve they don’t realize how many people don’t trust them especially after all the lies they spewed over the past 17 months. All they had to do when the v</em>ccine came out was to say here it’s available and leave it up to healthcare networks to promote it and distribute it and personal choice to take it and you probably would have seen much higher rates. But nope like everything else the government had to get their hands in it and royally screw it up. They have PSAs running constantly on media, tried giving you free food and cash, had influencers promote it, lied about its efficacy and told you you were going to go die and kill everyone else if you don’t get it. It was all wrong and just led to a host of conspiracies and more distrust that there was a bigger thing at play than just trying to end c<em>vid. Maybe they knew what they were doing all along that people wouldn’t take it and we would end up back at square one or maybe they are just so dumb they have no clue how bad they botched it all up. Well here we are staring down the barrel of mandates v</em>ccines, v<em>ccine passports to go anywhere, more lockdowns, masks and this seemingly never ending cycle of c</em>vid where a select few people benefit and everyone else suffers. Welcome to building back better and the new normal!</p></p>

        <p>Hell yeah, honesty from the start probably would have had me take it by now, and if they worked.</p>
<p>All they had to do was come out and say, "hey guys, this crazy flu-thingy is going around, not sure if it's a bioweapon or not, but, we have these vaccines if you are at risk, go to their website and check them out, there's a couple to choose from and we'll work to make them available in all communities. We'll also be mass producing some really great industrial strength vitamins that will help boost immune systems. And we strongly encourage daily sun exposure and light exercise. We're all in this together and if you are struggling please reach out to helplines for both financial assistance and mental health. We all need to take care of each other during this time".</p>
<p>Can you imagine if that had been the message from the beginning?</p>
