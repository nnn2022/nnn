    <strong>Gaslighting, I'm starting to doubt myself.</strong>
    <p><p>After desperately trying to show my friends and family videos, evidence, studies, undeniable evidence of everything going on. What did I think was going to happen?</p>
<p>Some of the nail in the coffin pieces I thought were the ex pfizer vp and the inventor of the mrna tech warning people, and the more deaths than the past 30 years of vaxes. I thought... these surely will get them thinking.</p>
<p>After showing so much of what I thought was undeniable, not only have they found some twisted logic to disregard it, but have called me a hypocrite, making me think I'm missing something, it's DOING MY FUCKING HEAD IN! I'm starting to doubt myself. Undeniable evidence all around us, and barely anyone sees it, I'm actually starting to question my own sanity.</p>
<p>The other day... I snapped. I walked out, and just asked random people on the street what they thought of everything going on. I just needed to find 1 person who thought like me.... NO ONE! The regurgitated propaganda they all spew out and all  genuinely  believe it. I can't believe I'm living in this mad house. WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING?</p>
<p>I can't live amongst these people any more. Even my close friends, family, loved ones, they're all head first in denial that they attack me when I talk about it, I feel as though I can't even mention the absurdity in front of me.</p>
<p>Here's an example: TRY AND EXPLAIN THIS?! WHAT IS THEIR THINKING? We were in a massive store the other day, hundreds of people walking around browsing items. Then we went into the restaurant on the other side of the store. "Only 1 person can leave the table and walk around at a time" says the waiter. EXCUSE ME? you want to think about what you just said, while just around the corner hundreds of people are all walking around in crowds browsing items?</p>
<p>And what did my family do? They told me to just let it go.</p>
<p>ARHGI EHSIOFHLEJSM:KJ GBLFKS:MEH GNMOFKLKSEN:LMFD!!!!! god damn this planet!</p>

<p>Edit: I'm suprised by so many and such great comments. I needed to hear all of this. Thank you everyone!</p></p>

        <p>Walk around with your big fucking nuts swinging between your legs.  You. Are. Not. Wrong.</p>
<p>Gaslighting is incredibly effective, and is basically all MSM is these days.  </p>
<p>You are not wrong, GME to the moon, the economy is about to come crashing down.  </p>
<p>You are not wrong.  Youre going to have a fucked economy, and all the sheeple have now demonstrated their loyalty to the propaganda.  They're conditioning people to have less, earn less and work less.  As long as we get netflix, porn, and skip the dishes. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is all a ruse by the greedy bankers to distract us from them raping the economy.  </p>
<p>I'm not wrong.  Neither are you.</p>

        <p>I feel you, the best advice I can give you is that it is normal. As much as it sucks there is a biological drive to fit in to your surroundings no matter how crazy they are. Most people don’t want to be the odd one out and will go along with nonsense as long as most others are.</p>
<p>I fight with this all the time but you just have to remember that they are being appealed to emotionally and no amount of logic can combat that. It’s like when people are blinded by love. The feelings are too strong they override any rational thought. It’s so obvious your S/O is cheating and everybody else can see it, but you are too blinded by emotions to see it rationally. It’s the same concept on a mass scale. </p>
<p>You can’t fight this with logic, best you can do is stand for what you believe is the truth regardless of how people feel, and hope others will eventually do the same.</p>
<p>You can’t bombard them, they have to reach conclusions themselves. I’ve found the best way is to just plant a seed in their mind and then let it go. Hopefully eventually an event in their life will happen and it will just click, and they will feel they came to the conclusion themselves which will allow them to accept it.</p>

        <p>Precisely. I need to get better at this myself. I have many friends that agree but I want to talk to those that may not.. unfortunately for some there is just no way to broach the topic. They get defensive or write you off, which hampers the friendship.</p>
<p>Asking soft questions and then letting them spin on their own hamster wheel is probably the best option for those who have religious-like held opinions.</p>

        <p>Definitely, nobody wants to admit they are wrong, and also rightfully so, nobody is going to just change their whole world view based on another’s opinion.</p>
<p>People also don’t see what they don’t WANT to see. Best just to point out how something doesn’t quite make sense but don’t push them. They might not see it right away but they might remember. Then when they see something else that doesn’t make sense they MIGHT then put 2 and 2 together. Some people are lost causes and don’t even want to see it differently because it will make their lives more difficult. Ignorance is bliss. But for the people who are open minded enough, might need a little nudge and having that open mind will lead them in the right direction. </p>
<p>It’s way easier to go with the flow and go where the water takes you. It takes work to go against the current and most don’t want to, nor do they even have time or energy. They work 8-10 hours of the day, have to take care of their families and so on. Doesn’t leave much time to worry about these kinda things(as important as they are).</p>
<p>It’s the old saying “you can lead a horse to water, but can’t make them drink”</p>
<p>So at this point I’m just planting seeds and doubt and what they do with it from there is up to them. There is no point in arguing and ruining friendships and relationships.</p>

So I've been called crazy for many years by most people. Funnily enough, I've never felt less alone than now! I see more and more people wake up to the bullshit because of the rona and the vaccines.</p>

        <p>Yeah they definitely rushed this Rona scam, it’s very unlike them. The pieces are not in place yet when usually they are ready to go before they initiate. There are people wakening to this for sure and that’s why the censorship has been at the highest level. Unfortunately it takes more than knowing to change anything. They are just going to keep pushing and most of the people that are awake are actually still playing the game. They still put their masks on and comply to all these rules. I realize most are in a bad spot where they need to work and buy groceries so they are put in a position where they have to comply and the Elite use this as a strategy. It’s very effective</p>

        <p>I tried to teach my father about a different false flag from recent memory years ago.  He didn't believe me at all.  However, several years later he made a new friend.  That friend eventually shared his feelings about that event with my father, and the switch was flipped immediately.</p>
<p>Because humans sadly form reality through consensus, I've found it impossible to single handedly convert someone to the truth.  But once they hear it from multiple disconnected sources, it triggers a wake up call.  That's a big part of the reason why the censorship is going to get even worse.  They cannot have us talking to each other in person, or online.</p>

        <p>Chill. It's different for them. Accept it. You are different, whether it be a spiritual or logical thing. That is the way it is. Let it go. Forget the constant trying to change the minds of those that have closed their mind on the subject. You will actually come out of it worse off. I am the same as you. I am seeing through the propaganda. I have read all the papers and watched all the censored experts. Just let them walk their own path. At the end, it is a narrow gate. I am hoping to be able to walk through it. Judging by your account, your friends and family are unlikely to even find it.</p>

        <p>If you look back at History when the Russians entered Auschwitz and liberated the camp they reported to the western allies what they found. Even at the end of the war they still refused to believe what they were being told until they could see it first hand themselves.</p>
<p>There is no point trying to change the minds of others without being able to see first hand evidence. All you have is your wits. I didn’t need a single scientist or media outlet to tell me something was wrong about all of this I made my mind up and have just watched the world turn on itself, that is enough evidence for me to know something is seriously wrong about all of this. You clearly feel the same so let them find out for themselves, they’re not your concern.</p>

        <p>Level of lockdown/mask usage has no correlation to cases. 
Ivermectin is, at the VERY least, somewhat effective, and safe. Covid is 1/2 as deadly as the flu to the vast majority of people. All previous variants are the same or even less risk than og covid, and delta will be no different. That's just off the top of my head. Happy to provide sources if you can't find them, which wouldn't be surprising considering the mind-boggling amount of censorship Google and every other tech company is doing on this topic.</p>

<li>Ivermectin may help. That is if you are willing to inject enough of it to find out. Be my guest. </li>
</ul>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin</p>
<p>Explain to me this. Merck the manufacturer of Ivermectin doesn't think it's a viable drug for treating Covid-19. Don't you think big pharma, you know the ones trying to get you to inject their vaccines, would intentionally avoid selling a viable treatment? Aren't they the big baddies just out to make money? Why would they not be pushing Ivermectin full force?</p>
<p>As for Covid-19 vs Flu old school. It's clearly more deadly. It's more deadly to the population now because it's novel. As the population exposure increases the death rate will fall. The population will begin to gain varying levels of immunity. Whether through exposure to the virus, vaccination and possibly some type of immunity through birth. Although not much is known about that. The seasonal flu that has been with us for 100 years, wait for it...........is the Spanish flu from 1918. Well not exactly. It's changed over time as it has swapped genetic material with other influenza virus over the century, but it's base genetic makeup is the flu virus from the 1918 pandemic.</p>

<p>And this. Deaths in the US 2019 vs 2020. Increase of about 20%. Maybe there was a pandemic caused by a novel virus? Could be.....right?</p>

        <p>Don't be such a patronizing dick. That first "study" just says that masks should theoretically work. Lol. Nice hard data. The second one is using data from a small time period when covid was still spreading and our testing was lacking. Not to mention, it looks at cases, not deaths or even hospitalizations. For people not knocking on deaths door already, it's a fucking cold.</p>
<p>As for ivermectin, it's an old as fuck drug so Merck would only produce a fraction. They wouldn't make much money, vaccines and subsequent booster shots wouldn't look as necessary with a lower death count. Have some imagination for fucks sake and stop googling for studies that you don't even read. </p>
<p>Yes, covid is rather deadly to a small, easily identifiable portion of the population. We should have focused on protecting them, and improving acute care because obviously new variants are going to come out and punch holes in this shitty rushed "vaccine". Oops, looks like it's time for a booster! </p>
<p>And yeah, the case fatality rate is hard to find because it's so LOW. And because PCR tests are inconsistent BS. Take your tech billionaire funded propoganda pieces and shove em - I'll read studies but most journalists have shown themselves to be nothing more than mouthpieces spewing opinions, not facts. I wish I could have a civil fucking conversation on this sub, but assholes like you take positions of authority on the most controversial and debatable topic in the last decade, and act like a fucking genius because you listen to NPR.

        <p>On the money with the old drug reply. Merck is contracting with some of the big three covid vaccine makers to help with distribution and also has their own contract with US Gov to develop treatments.

<p>True, you might not be right. But go with you’re gut. I was still on the fence till Dec when I actually crunched the CDC death numbers myself, using their own projections. </p>
<p>It was 5% of the whole US dead. It was about 5% increase of deaths. There were certain years in the 2010s that had spikes almost that big. </p>

        <p>We are actually the majority, albeit a small majority. Take heart, my friend. You are not wrong. The gaslighting is strong and the mass madness going around worse than any disease...but be thankful that you are not a brainwashed slug, npc type. Ignorance is not bliss and these people are merely suppressing their higher instincts and burying the truth that they know deep into their subconscious and they will have a reckoning. Be it a vaccine injury, a brain fog side effect for years, a gnawing or tugging at their very soul begging them to face the truth. These people, the ones that are in-fact people will have a reckoning. The truth is coming out and ala fox mulder's poster it is out there... it is everywhere for those who wish to see it. And hell will not come to earth before these people know the truth and know they have been deceived. Or we are already in hell and us being awake to this deception may be our ticket out of the bottomless pit! Either way you are not crazy! Go look up videos on youtube of literally anything from before 2010 and you will see the earth was populated by people who liked to be around others and didn't wear fucking masks and line up for strange needles and the news actually reported on vax madness with the swine flu vaccine in the 70's. You are sane... the world is in need of a psychoanalyst.</p>

        <p>You are awake to the coup for feudal/facist rule… do you think people in pre-holocaust Germany were called crazy? 100%. The way you know you’re right is you don’t have to take any action you’re not gonna do anything extremist no one’s going to get hurt no one is going to get persecuted by your action. The only minuscule chance of a negative affect (rooting from you) is a chance of getting and spreading a virus with a 99.9*% survival rate. Tuberculosis has a much lower survival rate.. and is still strong and around… no precautions there it kills over 1.5 million a year. The way you know it’s a lie is the hypocrisy and censorship</p>

        <p>Just remember that you are wise to question your stance once in a while. Reevaluating the situation from time to time and continuing to do your research on important health matters is a quality they don’t possess. I’ve been met with such illogical resistance at times as well. This makes us question ourselves and there’s nothing wrong with that. But, I don’t know anyone that’s died of Covid, no virus has ever mutated to become deadlier, a new medical technology has never been deemed safe and effective with such little testing, we’ve never been required to mix and match vaccines, no doctors have been threatened in recent history for showing concern, no definitions have flip flopped more, the censorship, etc</p>

        <p>It reminds me alot of 2002 and being against the lead up to the Iraq war. Pretty much everyone was for it because of constant MSM propaganda. Being against it meant taking alot of flak from alot of friends and families. Fast forward to 2006 and it was hard to find a Bush supporter anywhere. The disaster unraveled before everyone's eyes and became undeniable. The same will happen here. Hold fast and steady. People will remember who saw through the lies and told them the truth when it really counted.</p>

        <p>You have to walk alone. Even NNN is a cesspool now of HIVE MIND.</p>

<p>If you do not conform to the rules of NNN, you will be hated. </p>
<p>Have you ever read that book in grade school, when the kids get dropped off on that island and they end up killing each other. We are there now. NNN is just an echo chamber now, and it is no longer a place where people can be free. It is now a pile of shit. Stoned liberals that follow Joe Rogan control this site.</p>
