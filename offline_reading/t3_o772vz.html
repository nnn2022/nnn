    <strong>Why didn't anyone demand better quality real vaccines?</strong>
    <p><p>I wrote this provaxx guy and told them vaxx are poor quality. I should be able to go to my writer's group and other groups of vaxxed people and not give a crap about "catching it" [whatever real virus is out there beyond cooked PCR tests], if it was a real vaccine, it'd be no issue. 10 vaxxed people, and me unvaxxed, it would not make a difference. They'd be "safe" and I would have no dangers. That's why these Covid vaxx are utter shit. That's basically what I told him.</p>
<p>I actually went to go see if I could find a foreign vaccine, that was safe and had an inactivated virus, still looking. Some of you believe the virus does not really exist but some people I know did get some severe lung thing that almost killed them, so something is out there. This is not a success of science but a failure. I can tell the vaxxed here are stressed out, because they are sending surveys, about rules, wearing masks, etc at groups. If they had traditional vaccines, they would not give a crap. They would be safe. We were handed a POOR PRODUCT that even if it was done honestly not meant for depopulation or other theories people have, has failed to meet even the standard of quality we had before.</p></p>

        <p>I saw someone on another sub say "it doesn't stop you from catching or spreading it. Don't you know how vaccines work??" and I was like I thought I did but apparently not....ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤ª</p>

        <p>To this day, contrary to MSM claims, not a single virus has been found and isolated the classical way. They all rely on rna which they claim to isolate. If you believe this to be true (it might not be), you couldn't be honest with yourself and find a shot with inactivated virus. If however, you believe this not to be true, you might want to look at sinovac, the Chinese one, which claims to function on inactivated virus. (Thus I consider it the safest shot.)</p>

        <p>There's a simple reason: <em>the universe does not care what we want</em>. The reason why we don't have a good vaccine is that in the time we had, it couldn't be done. A deactivated virus vaccine would be safer, but coronaviruses are weird and vaccines for them haven't been done before. Just because we want a safe and effective vaccine, doesn't mean it can be done quickly, or possibly even at all.</p>
