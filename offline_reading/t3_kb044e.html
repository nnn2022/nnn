<title>As a former Mayor candidate I'm very embarrassed that Democrats/left here in Arizona are literally wishing death on those who just want to forget about covid for one day &amp; live their lives &amp; be happy &amp; on those that question the "new normal". This is disgusting &amp; disturbing behavior!</title>

    <p><p>Im from Arizona which is basically somewhat Sweden light at this point regarding covid &amp; I'm seriously tired of mostly democrats/leftists here wishing death on anyone who just wants to live their lives for one day &amp; be happy for one minute &amp; wishing death on those who question certain things regarding covid and it's "new normal" measures. As a former Political candidate who ran for Phoenix mayor and the youngest to do so at only 22 years old!(I'm now 23) I've definitely caught heat for being openly anti-lockdown and questioning the so called "new Normal" &amp; I've stuck to my guns about my stances! However what I notice is other Democrat voters and Democratic candidates are very hypocritical(Nancy,newsom,whitmer etc are good examples of this) many love to scream at people to stay home,wear masks,don't have any fun etc then get caught not practicing what they preach and still make excuses!!! Then there's me.....I admit I go to the gym,stores &amp; hang with friends and I've been fine and I don't knock anyone who does do all that aswell! Also I've gotten heat for how I said I would've handled covid, which I said numerous times if I was mayor I would've fought against shutdowns/curfews &amp; allowed businesses to stay open, recommend basic commonsense guidelines!(a similar plan to Sweden's) as our governer has left most decisions up to the local mayors. Neverless not all of us democrats are doomers, there's Sensible ones out here! You'd be surprised how many Democrat voters I've spoken to when I was campaigning secretly wrote me in(I was a write in as it was my first time running and I entered the race late) cause they secretly agreed that these new normal measures are way too much! Quite a few republicans voted for me aswell and I'm the only democrat they voted for lol just goes to show, everyone knows how ridiculous this crap is no matter what party you are but many are scared to admit it due to social status☹️</p></p>

        <p>FYI yes I admit at beginning of the covid Pandemic I was somewhat caught up in the hysteria(although at the beginning Ive been against the distancing rules as it's proven the whole 6 feet is outdated &amp; does not work) but I evolved on the issue over time as I started questioning everything and looking into data and seeing how ridiculous the measures were,the hypocrisy and the many nurses I know telling me that the recovery rate is very decent is what made my stances final! Also the number of recovered show that the recovery rate is very high</p>

        <p>I don’t really blame those people.  They really are just afraid.  I blame the media and politicians that are intentionally blowing this thing way out of proportion.</p>

        <p>I do.  We are still in all of this because people refuse to see past headlines and do even a molecule of critical thinking or research. </p>
<p>The information is right there, yet they watch CNN and believe the propaganda. </p>
<p>It actually makes me sick that my life hinges on the decision making process of morons.</p>
<p>This plays exactly into my favorite Ben Franklin anecdote: </p>
<p>When asked by a woman what type of government they created, he replied: "a Republc madam, if you can keep it".</p>
<p>That reply RELIES on people remaining informed.</p>
<p>We are not "keeping it".</p>

        <p>Fair points, but I think the bigger is this - why are these people unable to think critically?  It’s because the educational system was dismantled by the communists a long time ago, for exactly the moment we are in now.</p>
<p>Our fathers generation rested on their forefather’s laurels and were not able to see the dark clouds gathering over their head.  They felt content to demean their children‘s generation rather than realizing the issues accumulating.</p>

        <p>Exactly! Well because I refuse to play into the hysteria I've been called "Fake Democrat" or "Secret republican/Trump supporter" by the same people who say Coronavirus isn't being used as a Political weapon or swear it's only the right making it Political.......give me a fucking break!</p>
