    <strong>To the US and UK members of our subreddit: are things really opening and getting close to normal?</strong>
    <p><p>Here in Canada, everything is still completely draconian lock down with no real goal posts or path forward released to the general public. You always hear rumbling from others though, things like "UK is almost vaccinated and back to normal", "New York is opening back up", "United States is taking off the masks and getting close to done"  </p>
<p>Is any of this actually true, or is it just false hope? I'd like to hear from the people who are actually living, working and playing in those areas.</p></p>

        <p>Uk. Our beloved leader set a road map to exit, June 21st is back to normal, everything open,  no distancing but no mention of masks. People will ditch the masks of their own accord. He said to 'watch the data not the dates' data says these dates should have been bright forward ages ago.</p>
<p>For now its half normal, some things are open but reduced capacity, masks, outdoor dining and take away meals still mean everything is boring and depressing enough not to yet get excited.</p>
<p>Workplaces are far from normal with many still at home and reduced capacity and masks required a lot. I'm one of 5 people in a 1500 capacity office block, masks and distancing required at all times, ridiculous.</p>
<p>People have stopped thinking for themselves and have faith in magic men off the telly to 'save' them.</p>

        <p>Texas - life is pretty much normal.  We are back in our office now working.  We have to wear a mask when we walk around, but in our cubicles we can breathe free air.  </p>
<p>Outside of work the bar district was lively this weekend.  White people were underrepresented from previous years.  I guess urban whites all watched CNN and got scared.</p>
<p>The stores still have signs that we must wear masks.  I don't.  I never did.  Last year, I was the only one not wearing a mask in the stores.  This month, about 5% of us go maskless.  Seems to be increasing every week since the Texas state mask mandate was lifted lady month.</p>

        <p>Scotland UK. I work in a hotel and we can't serve alcoholic drinks in the restaurant and bar but we can bring them to the guests room. Some customers asked me what the point was and that was crazy. I can't disagree with them tbh, it's indeed pointless and crazy. This virus can spread only in alcoholic drinks served in front of the bar, but he's discreet enough to not enter a hotel room. What a chap</p>

        <p>We tried to donate kids clothes today. They wouldn't take them because the clothes were in garbage bags. They needed to be in containers that they could wipe down. So we opened the garbage bags, poured the clothes into reusable shopping bags, and then they were acceptable. </p>

        <p>Wisconsin, USA here. Only places near me that mandate masks are Menard's (hardware store), quite the local authentic Mexican restaurant and Chinese buffet. Everywhere else either has no policy or they do not enforce the posted policy. I have never seen anyone wear a mask outdoors in I don't know how long. In places with unenforced mask policies it is about 25-33% free breathers. In places like gas stations it's about half or less that actually masks. Capacityimits are posted in some places like Walmart but of course they are not and never were enforced. Drinking and dining culture is strong here and bars and restaurants are packed without any semblance of social distancing. Even when masked people do not abide by any social distancing.</p>

        <p>Maine hasn't moved in months.  Some (blue) states are dragging their feet.  Summer may be a tipping point, but to be clear, this isn't over.  Until/unless someone like Dr. Fuellmich or another team of lawyers take the WHO et al to task over this, there is nothing to stop it from happening again at the drop of a hat.</p>

        <p>Cases are going up in my country as lockdown is eased but deaths are staying low (bout 0.1% right now) because the people that were dying from it have had their vaccinations so aren't getting it as bad now.</p>

        <p>I'm curious about the UK too. I'll see videos if cops attacking people for not wearing masks and then watch some UK youtubers walk around outside with their masks down and some of the people around them doing the same.</p>

        <p>Georgia, USA is pretty much normal, except big box stores require masks (but no one really cares if you don't have one). Oh, and also a couple of odd businesses I know of are still in "appointments only" mode, I just don't shop there anymore.</p>

        <p>Red state, blue city. It certainly doesn't feel like it. California reopening is bs. Masks still required, testing and shot requirements still in place. Their "fully reopen" is what we have now, and we're about to enter another summer of the stupid costume party. The TSA is requiring masks on mass transit into September, and I'm sure they won't extend it <em>this</em> time...</p>

        <p>Here in NY we've been eating in restaurants since last September. My work had been sending me to Ohio since last October and they went from hardly wearing masks to pretty much no masks by March. Went to Missouri last August and it was 50/50 people with our without masks; can't imagine what it is now. Many states are without mask mandates including Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and Arkansas. They are having crowded events down in the South with 10s of thousands of people. Here in NY we're beginning to have events but they're sectioning us off by who's vaccinated and who's not.</p>
