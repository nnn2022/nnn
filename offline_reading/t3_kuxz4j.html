    <strong>Sending kids to college?</strong>
    <p><p>My son has really great grades. He’s a senior in high school. We have not looked into colleges. My oldest is starting out at community college, which is kind of our plan for everyone. Our community college is all remote right now, which my oldest hates. My son has better grades and might possibly qualify for some kind of scholarship. I don’t want to pay to send him to what is essentially a dorm jail cell. </p>
<p>All my kids think I’m nuts for being against the lockdown. It’s hard to have this discussion with him. </p>
<p>I kind of want to tell him to get a job and wait a year but jobs might be scarce, considering restaurants are closed for dining right now. Bars are closed. All those workers have to go somewhere.</p></p>

        <p>I think college is overrated. The big question is what do they want to do? There is only a handful of occupations that require a college education. If they are going to college to figure out what they want as a career then it is a wrong step. </p>
<p>Identify what they are good at. Notice i did not say "follow your passion", there are only so many pro gamer slots. Everyone has some natural talent, could be arts or business or engineering or electrician. Once you have that, the path is easy.</p>

        <p>Tell them to deliver pizzas for a year. It’s good money in tips, they can attend college next year if for some bizarre reason life goes back to normal.</p>

        <p>If he wants to go to university he can live off campus, no one says you need to live in a dorm.  Add on to that he can get a job off campus- if he wants to go to univeristy.  If he wants a gap year he can defer the scholarships and grants.  He may even find an employer with some type of tuition reimbursement.  There are many options but  'your' plan may not be your kids plan.</p>

        <p>I work at a private, non-profit school and I am back at in-person instruction on Wednesday! I’ve built many great relationships with my students and other than some silly requirements, it hasn’t impacted my instruction very much. I would encourage him to consider a smaller school, at least for the first two years, that will allow you to come for an on-campus visit NOW. This would be a good metric for what the restrictions are going forward. I’m happy to answer more questions via DM if needed!</p>

        <p>As a parent of a HS senior, I can tell you there is a continuum of COVID policies and you need to investigate each school individually. Some of them are draconian with mandatory lockdowns and don't let kids leave the dorm room for two weeks. Some have no lockdowns. Some have regular testing, some don't. Some have most classes online, some have very few online. Some have recorded lectures, some have live teaching even when online.</p>
<p>COVID policies has completely changed the list of schools my student was considering a year ago and it also means she is likely moving across the country which also was not in the original plan.</p>
<p>The application deadlines and scholarship deadlines are looming and your son needs to decide very soon. He has nothing to lose by applying to several schools and can always defer admission if he decides to wait a year.</p>
