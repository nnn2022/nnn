    <strong>What is the legality of your employer requiring performing medical tests on you?</strong>
    <p><p>It's been done before for drug testing and pilots go through stringent health exams periodically. I was once turned down for a job because my initial physical revealed an operation I had when I was 16. I was hired anyway. </p>
<p>But except for that, since I neither do drugs nor fly planes, none of it has really affected me. A relative once had to disclose being on anti-crazy pills because the pills made her fail a drug test, which was not fun for her.</p>
<p>With all the increasing emphasis on privacy and ADA regulations, it seems like a conflict to require tests, especially having the company perform the tests themselves, and know the results. </p>
<p>I guess it's legal because it's been status quo for some time, but isn't there some criteria that the employer needs to have a legitimate reason to know? But then since you're going to be on their health insurance, would they have the right to know pretty much every possible issue? </p>
<p>Insurance was the reason given for initially turning me down as I mentioned above. I had to go back for a follow-up. I had worked every job in my life <em>after</em> the operation with no issues so it made no sense to deny me.</p></p>
