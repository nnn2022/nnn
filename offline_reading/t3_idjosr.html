        <p>Wow hell. I’m Dutch. This stuff is getting out if hand. I dont hear a mention of masks in the clip. And the riots themselves weren’t really mask related. But of course apparently everyone whines about masks so there must a connection now if there wasn’t one  before. They were just standing there as far as i could tell and that ME’er just hit her across the face with his stick. </p>
<p>Crazy</p>

        <p>I dont really know but i think it isnt. The clip you sent isnt clear so it could be. But i think its from more recent bouts of rioting that have less to do with corona</p>

        <p>Okay so the first one I think is the one in this post i already saw.</p>
<p>neither video has a lot of context I must say and the audio is pretty bad.</p>
<p>Both are just yet more examples of the current situation in Den Haag and many Dutch cities. These riots don't real reason, people just have nothing better to do.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The first one the spoken words you hear are clearly spoken by the two women in the picture. One of them mainly. The police voice-over through a  megaphone  is hard to hear.</p>
<p>Sounds like in the first seconds the police voiceover is saying  the last words of a sentence that ends with "geweld worden gebruikt" which would translate to "violence will be used" Judging by what happens next i guess the whole sentence must have been something like "if you don't leave/ if you don't obey the polices order, violence will be used"</p>
<p>Grey haired lady : "we're just standing here"</p>
<p>Lady wit ponytail: "yeah we're doing absolutely nothing"</p>
<p>Women get pushed by shields.</p>
<p>After this I think I hear a cop in the distance yelling " Section [inaudible, could be the word "handhaving" which is "enforcement" a kind of police division that often appear to keep control at festivals and soccer matches to keep people in line] NOW!"</p>
<p>Policeman: "Walk!" [hits ponytail lady across the face and then across the legs with his stick]</p>
<p>grey Lady: "And why should I?"</p>
<p>Police 2: " Hey come here, you have to come with me"</p>
<p>Grey Lady: "yeah but why? Damn you guys are pathetic/sad"</p>
<p>Then you hear the lady say the first part of the Dutch curseword "godverdomme" = "goddamnit"</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The other clip with more people is harder to hear except for the voice of the woman holding the phone.</p>
<p>Someone: Film This!</p>
<p>Lady with phone: yep yep yep. ..... People this is on purpose! You can't do this cant you see we're looking right at you?</p>
<p>Man in background "what are these people doing?!"</p>
<p>phone lady: yeah but we're seeing what you [do] (sentence cut off)</p>
<p>( at this point I noticed one man carrying a green flag is wearing a black bodywarmer with the text "lockdown is that silent killer" on it. So this was probably an anti-lockdown protest then?)</p>
<p>phone lady: What the fuck! Hey! (while filming old lady with bloody face) What is this?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>basically, as I've told here on reddit before. Den Haag (and many other cities too I guess) is a big mess now. Not sure how much of it you know?</p>

        <p>Thank you! </p>
<p>I did see some tweets from Geert Wilders (I'm not a fan and we have many such people in the US called neocons) supporting riot police, but this footage of the women being attacked is being shared by other anti-lockdown people on twitter. Are the anti-lockown protests being called "riots"?</p>

        <p>I've been slowly warming up to Wilders the past 3 years. 3-4 years ago i hated him, now I kinda see where he's coming from. 
I'm still gonna wait a bit to see who I'm gonna vote for this time in our elections, but he's in with a chance. It all depends on the debates for me. I don't hate Rutte, the current Minister President, but I'm no huge fan either. Guess I'll wait to decide. </p>
<p>"Are the anti-lockown protests being called "riots"?"</p>
<p>mostly they aren't. We usually just hear them being called protests. But the Riots going on in Den Haag and in Utrecht and other cities right now are riots for sure. And I guess in the middle of all that the anti-lockdown protests are still happening so they kinda get thrown on the pile with all the other stuff going on and get called "riots" too.</p>
<p>The riots themselves are a combination of a lot of things. The heatwave we had (and still kinda have) led to stupid people breaking open fire hydrants to get water fountains to cool off, which the police (rightfully) put an end to, and people got pissed at the police for ruining their fun.</p>
<p>Aside from that People were just fed up with staying inside. As the heatwave let up slightly they wanted to go outside and have fun, which, for a lot of youngsters in Den Haag equals "lets go and destroy stuff". 
Den Haag is a city with a big "Fuck everyone else, I've got me and only me"- mentality. There's a lot of immigrants who are poorly intergrated. The way  neighbourhoods are set up makes little sense. The very wealthy live right next to the slums, the prostitutes, there are so many different groups and none of the care a rat's ass about the other. But all of them collectively, especially the younger people and among those especially the immigrant kids, have a deep hatred for the police. </p>
<p>So they riot. They burn things, the steal, they kick police, they attack politicians, threaten innocent bystanders and homeowners. It's a mess.  I can kinda see why, in the midst of all that, the police are on high alert. though there is of course no excuse to hit two middle age/ elderly ladies who are doing nothing other than standing on the square. That isn't a riot. 
But there are genuine problems now that I think give the police some room to act with force, So I'm not sure what to think.</p>
<p>All of it is just very confusing right now.</p>

        <p>We've had such a terrible experience with neocons that I feel I must warn Holland against Wilders in the strongest possible terms. These people do not care about our countries, their hearts are in the Middle East. The immigration problem is a direct result of their foolhardy wars and evil human-rights abuses. They meddle and destabilize the ME, then complain about the refugees that are the result of their bad behavior. But the very worst part is that they promote a police state in our once-free countries. Supposedly it's for the immigrants, but they actually won't do anything about them, but they certainly will viciously attack innocent native people like these ladies.</p>
