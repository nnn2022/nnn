        <p>No need to get upset and ask a preposterous rhetorical question?   </p>
<p>Do you think it potentially problematic that... </p>
<p>- he wouldn't specifically disclose his conflicts of interest in the JAMA </p>
<p>- his foundation holds significant assets in stocks and corporate bonds of the corporations profiting off the vaccine </p>
<p>- several high level people at his foundation held their last jobs before that at companies now profiting off the vaccines</p>
<p>- a private actor with financial skin in the game (profit motive ON TOP OF tax avoidance due to philantropy/"philantropy") is the largest WHO contributor actively shaping global public policies without any democratic legitimation behind him whatsoever </p>
<p>- while simultaneously being the donator (through his foundation) of large sums of money to MSM media outlets and one of the key "experts" going on about how great and necessary the vaccines are?   </p>
<p>I'm not presenting any conclusions, but please don't pretend like these known facts from the public domain don't hint at some legitimate questions.</p>

        <p>I believe people should have the freedom to put whatever they want into their body, including meth and heroin, but they should also have the freedom to <em>not</em> put stuff in their body. And they should have the freedom to travel freely without some corporate or government goon saying, "Papers, please," so they can see your private medical history.</p>
<p>I for one have not had any shots since high school, almost twenty years ago, because I believe that good diet and exercise are a better defense against sickness than Big Pharma. If -- and I do mean if -- all else fails, <em>then</em> I will gladly use modern medicine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my understanding is that the Covid-19 "vaccine" is actually not a true vaccine in the traditional sense, but rather an experimental gene therapy technology which uses mRNA software to program cells.</p>
<p>That these mega-corporations are exempt from liability pursuant to damages from the so-called "vaccines," or experimental mRNA injections, is a neon flashing red flag.</p>

        <p>Fetal stem lines are the number one factor for me. Aside from that, we have conquered every single disease that has come our way without vaccines, for 200,000 years. To suddenly require them after they have only been around for minimum of a century or so we have no idea what it could be doing long term. We know fertility rates are down massively, mental health an cognitive health are in steep declines. We know the government and science has lied to us during the Tuskegee experiment, sterilized native americans without their consent, told us cigarettes and sugar were good fine for us, created an opiate crisis, and created nuclear weapons and global warming (literally the most destructive forces in all of humanity). On top of the fetal stem cells, and super sketchy ingredients and studies that show some do have major inflation after vaccination which can cause major damage there's no reason for me to get a vaccine when I have a 99.9% of walking away from COVID just fine.</p>

        <p>J&amp;J isn't a traditional vaccine either, it's a viral vector.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about "gene therapy", the J&amp;J one is actually worse since it actually contains human-compatible DNA. The mRNA ones (Pfizer and Moderna) are one-time code: one and done, they make a protein and get out, like computer code in RAM. https://www.deplatformdisease.com/blog/no-really-mrna-vaccines-are-not-going-to-affect-your-dna (ignore the awful title of this blog, because it really is an excellent article); also, the mRNA is <em>modified</em> to evade the immune system, but that modification also prevents it from ever even being used by a reverse transcriptase: https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/  [edit: even without that modification; it doesn't have the right kind of sequence to ever be used this way in the first place, as the first article describes in detail]</p>
<p>The J&amp;J one should be too, in theory, but some viruses' DNA has been known to integrate in the human genome. The fact it isn't widely observed with the adenovirus doesn't mean it can never happen. I'll personally take the risk for the J&amp;J shot given its very good clinical trial results, but I wouldn't for AstraZeneca's viral vector shot which doesn't even seem to be reliably effective</p>
<p>Viral vectors are used for actual "gene therapy" (but not those viruses, usually); mRNA isn't because it can't stick around.</p>
<p>A "traditional" vaccine is either a whole virus, attenuated or inactivated; or a stabilized protein or thing the immune system can see on its own. China has been pushing the former ("CoronaVac"), inactivated thank god since attenuated coronavirus would be a nightmare to handle; but I still have safety suspicions because of past vaccine events (Pandemrix with the H1N1 flu); the larger a piece of virus you produce or include, the more likely it is to cause a dangerous, disabling autoimmune reaction. Using the spike protein alone is much safer by everything we know. NovaVax has a very promising stabilized protein shot that could be more reliable and safer than the vectors, and cheaper to produce and easier to handle than the mRNA. But right now, the mRNA is the gold standard for both effectiveness and safety</p>

        <p>yes, I agree that is false!</p>
<p>I don't think viral vector is any more traditional than mRNA. Both are recombinant (i.e. GMO). The only weirdness about mRNA is the frozen temperatures it needs to be shipped ‚Äî because it is indeed fragile, too fragile to do you any harm really</p>
<p>The ones I have been really skeptical of, and in the west mostly haven't taken off: inactivated whole virus (because of years of trial and error needed for "normal" vaccines to know which cell formations are bad; e.g. old whole-cell pertussis was bad, and the Pandemrix H1N1 was a massive f*ckup); pure DNA (not RNA); <em>reproducing</em> viral vectors which are viable viruses in themselves. Of those only inactivated whole virus (which is the most common worldwide for all historical vaccines, but those have decades of experience behind them) has caught on elsewhere to any real extent.</p>
<p>Virus-like particle (VLP) doesn't seem likely to be harmful but it simply hasn't done well in clinical trials anywhere, too. So we're left with mRNA, non-reproducing viral vectors, and protein subunits (only the last of which is a "traditional" technology in any way)</p>

        <p>I don't think vaccines just straight up don't work or anything and I have children so I am definitely grateful for the advances in science that have lowered infant mortality rates. However there were plenty of diseases we evolved to become immune to. Some ethnicities today are still more immune to some diseases than others due to previous epidemics in those populations.</p>
<p>I have two doctors in my family, one is a chiropractor/family physician so of course he is hesitant but the other is a regular MD and also skeptical. Considering that means 100% of doctors I know, it makes me even more skeptical. I still have a flip phone because I am just suspicious of technology in general. </p>
<p>From what I understand pandemics are going to become more and more of a problem and if we just keep vaccinating our way out of them it seems possible people will eventually need thousands of vaccines just to stay alive. Similar to the concerns with antibiotic resistance bacteria and such it just seems like we could be messing with things in ways we don't understand. I am not a scientist and probably low iq but I trust my gut with these kinds of things.</p>

        <p>personally, I don't "disbelieve" in vaccines or believe anything in particular about them. I mostly just believe that my body is fine how it is. On the other hand, I also don't believe human initiative is all that great, either. I think things are generally pretty good at optimizing themselves, all by themselves, and that human interventions mostly just make them worse. So to me, it's kinda just ridiculous that I would do things the way humans currently think they should be done, just because humans like their way better, when I'm already totally cool with doing things my own way, and when I'd rather entrust myself to my body than entrust myself to human intervention anyway. There's just no reason to even think about it.</p>
<p>I feel like most things people do, they do because they've fallen into a condition of believing they need something. Maybe they're hopeless, because they don't acknowledge the good. Maybe they're in pain, because they don't do the work that fixes it. Maybe they have attributed undue significance to worthless things. Maybe they're just greedy. Either way, the person himself causes it to happen, and, as a result, he perceives need. This makes him easy prey, so that anything which appears to fulfill his need will be able to compel his behavior, causing him to do things with the goal of addressing his need. Many people will exploit this, of course, deceiving others, enticing them or luring them into dependency, intending to control them. Some people exploit others to address their own needs, and some people are easily exploited in the course of addressing their own needs, but each person is himself guilty, because each person has permitted his own condition of need to exist in himself. Because this behavior is widespread, senseless behavior abounds, and the state of mankind will only continue to worsen.</p>
<p>if you don't tell yourself some silly shit is important, you won't desire a vaccine or any other weird thing.</p>
