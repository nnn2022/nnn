    <strong>I'm painting vaccine victims and sending them to their families to raise awareness and try to stop the level of segregation happening. We are all just people, enough of the vaxxed vs unvaxxed!</strong>
    <p><p>Edit: NNN mods reinstated! link to original post here, but as another poster commented it's pretty far buried now: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oohqy4/art_initiative_what_im_doing_to_spread_awareness/">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/oohqy4/art_initiative_what_im_doing_to_spread_awareness/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Okay, so I tried to post this to the sub yesterday and NNN removed it for some reason. Now they won't let me post the photos! I don't understand what is happening, no mods responded to my inquiries. Are we not allowed to share the actual activism we are doing? On instagram this morning Dr Bradley Campbell with over 100k followers shared my page, but NNN doesn't deem it fit to be posted? If you're interested, please go check out c0vidvictimsportraits, but spell it normally on instagram. I'm super disappointed in this sub, I've been here since the beginning but wouldn't expect such censorship here.</p>
<p>Here's what I posted with my original painting images, which for some reason I can not post now (it says invalid url, I've tried multiple times):</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is Stephen Wright. He had the poison injection on January 18th, and died 8 days later. He leaves behind a grieving wife and three kids. He worked for the NHS, and honestly thought he was doing something for the community.</p>
<p>I've painted about 15 victims so far of the most intensive propaganda campaign we've ever witnessed. These families are absolutely beside themselves, demanding answers, and being completely ignored. Worse, they are being shunned by their own communities and gaslit. Having been a member of this community for years, I know I'm not alone in saying that watching our predictions unfold has not been in anyway enjoyable. It's been heartwrenching and I've found myself in tears so many times feeling helpless. Using my art to give to some people who are grieving and show them that people care has been the only thing that has helped. If you or anyone you know has lost someone to the gene therapy, please have them contact me if they would like a memorial portrait. All I want is to show some love and light amidst this darkness.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, sorry about that.  I actually didn't see the captions below your art last night.</p>
<p>The trolls were up to some particularly weird stuff yesterday and impersonating our users is a particular favorite for them.</p>
<p>For example. they will have a long text post like yours and then make most if it sound legit and then slip in something absurd, sometimes by editing the post.</p>
<p>For some reason they think it's hilarious when people either overlook or ignore the weird part.  They think it's because we're stupid but I think it's because by default we tend to be nice to each other.</p>

        <p>it is important to confirm that the family members are looking to seek the truth. would be wrong if they agree that taking the vaccine was the right thing to do and you sent them this message about how vaccine ruined lives.</p>

        <p>i just read the NNN rules. point 10. states "No Misinformation". So i guess this is the wild card to remove anything mods don't like, just like the rest of the covid subs... did not notice that until i tried to figure out why your post got removed...</p>
