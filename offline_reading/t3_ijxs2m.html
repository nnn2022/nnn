<p>&rt;My proposal: Library rules for America.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Every time you walked into a school, clinic, drug store, barbershop, office, or airport, there's a big fat sign at the door:<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;MASK UP AND SHUT UP<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;KEEP QUIET AND CARRY ON<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;MAKE GOOD CHOICES; LOWER YOUR VOICES</p>

        <p>just remember, the money machine can go BRRRRRRRRRR forever. inflation is a myth. Keynes is the good cop, Hayek is the bad cop. of course you can turn the economy off and on without any serious repercussions.</p>
<p>these people have never thought critically about MMT and it shows. it's an embarrassment to the field of economics that they're allowed to parrot these talking points without any challenge from the left or right.</p>

        <p>the Atlantic has been recycling Chinese talking points and propaganda on this manufactured crisis since literally January, when they were appalled that Trump wanted to shut down travel to/from China. (link here from Feb 2020: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/trump-response-coronavirus/606610/)</p>
<p>their entire staff is balls-deep in this "new normal" BS, it's nauseating. they have nothing better to do than push this constant hysteria and fear mongering; they revel in the panic porn. since March their coverage of well, everything, has been an incestuous circle jerk on repeat. it's incredible how the worst, most miserable, misanthropic people are all working for the same periodical. their office parties must suck. do they realize that they're trapped in an echo chamber? smh.</p>
<p>sadly, they aren't the only publication where we can see that China is pulling some of the content strings (<em>cough cough</em> insert ABBA money money money gif) - look at Slate, New York Magazine, and Wired.</p>
<p>the only truly independent reporting i've seen lately is from the Economist and the Financial Times. i've even started reading the Washington Examiner. (that's how you know it's bad.)</p>

        <p>I'd be careful with The Economist, it has more intellectual articles than many mainstream publications, but look at who owns them: the Rothschilds own 21%, the Agnelli family, an Italian industrialist dynasty that has intermarried with the von Furstenberg princes, among other European nobility, owns 48%, the Cadbury industrialist dynasty, one of whom was director of the Bank of England, has a share, among other billionaire families and their foundation-fronts.  They've also been pushing for a global digital currency for decades, implanting the idea in the global consciousness.

        <p>They probably fantasize that they could be at the top in a China-style regime and then they could "get things done" because they wouldn't have to trouble themselves with democratic processes. As it turns out in real life less-democratic regimes do not on average tend to be more efficient at accomplishing anything; China's effectiveness has little to do with how undemocratic it is, and may have succeeded to the extent it has despite its political system rather than because of it. Nevertheless, it is a common fantasy of would-be central planners. You see the same thing with these same sort of people praising Soviet-style communism for the same reasons when it was around, and fascism as well in the 1920s and 30s.</p>
