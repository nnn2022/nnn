    <strong>Trying and failing to get religious exemption (UK)</strong>
    <p><p>My company sent the dreaded 'get vaccinated' email yesterday. </p>
<p>Today I spent two hours trying to convince a Catholic priest to grant me a religious exemption (I was raised in this religion) to no avail. I then spoke with a Greek orthodox priest who would not grant me an exemption based on the fact I am not a part of their church, even though I could tell he was sympathetic to my point this was biblical end times. </p>
<p>I'm beyond frustrated. We should NOT be blackmailed with our ability to earn a living contingent upon this injection. </p>
<p>Has anyone had any actual luck getting an religious exemption?</p></p>

        <p>They haven't mandated it yet, as they're aware they cant legally force us. But it's started with guilt tripping and implying we are being selfish and a danger to everyone else basically. And if they legislation changes then they will use that to mandate. </p>
<p>Anyway, my line is drawn and they are aware of my stance. At least there are a few others who also choose not to take it. </p>
<p>The more baffling to me was the orthodox priest basically agreeing with me and telling be to be willing to lose my job but not vouching for his fellow human. I feel a religious waiver would be legally stronger if it comes down to it</p>

        <p>Good effort. As you say, stand your ground - I'd also keep records of abuse/pressure, keep a diary... If they find a reason to fire you, take them to the cleaners.</p>
<p>And yes, that's a shame the priest didn't have your back with that, sorry</p>

        <p>Less than 25 percent of the world population has been vaccinated. We're just on a site that has a very vocal minority. </p>
<p>I can't wait for vaccine passports to be implemented. Those business' that require them will be shutting down due to bankruptcy within a year. They want to fire employees that won't get the jab? The employees that did will quit due to being overworked since they now have to pick up the slack.</p>

<p>We're already having problems filling spaces in my company just due to lockdown shit. We're already overworked because of that. It wouldn't take much at all to tip us over the edge. 3 people in my team of 8 are not planning on getting the jab.</p>
<p>I don't think they have a choice in the matter really, let us make our own decisions, or lose the half the team without being able to replace us.</p>

        <p>You don't need a religious exemption. Tell your employer that you refuse to tell them whether you've taken the covid vaccine or not and they they will need to take you to court if they don't agree with this. They will fold as they have no legal right to ask you and you have no legal requirement to tell them.</p>

        <p>It is literally illegal for anyone (that includes employer) to stick their noses in to your personal medical business, legislation is on your side here. Tell them to back off otherwise you’ll be taking your case to a solicitor, anything they say or claim regarding the vaccine or your medical status have them put it in black and white and keep a comprehensive file to back up all your claims should it go to court.</p>
<p>You have the right to say no and your employer can in no way discriminate against you without the threat of legal action looming.</p>
<p>My employer didn’t even ask me to wear a mask as soon as I asked them to put it in writing and sign it, because they knew there arses would get torn to pieces if they ever tried anything.</p>
<p>You have a legal right to medical privacy!</p>

        <p>They threaten suspension and termination of employment by private employers here in the states. If they aren't saying that yet, I would just stand my ground. Are there any other vaccines you are required to get for employment over there? See what they accept for exemptions for those. Here each state may be different. Most only allow medical or religious and not philosophical. They also are not supposed to ask for a letter from clergy, but like I said that is here, could be different for you.</p>

        <p>Look for a traditional Catholic priest, such as from an SSPX parish.</p>
