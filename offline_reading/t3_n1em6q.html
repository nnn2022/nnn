    <strong>Concerns</strong>
    <p><p>Hey, I've been hovering around here for about a month now and I am personally very cynical and questioning of the vaccine, but kind of on the fence as of late due to family and friends being concerned about me. I'll just get straight to my questions though. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do any of you feel like there will be a wave that actually does damage and the vaccine will protect against it? Like what I'm paranoid about is the fact I was just told that Biden mentioned a second wave and something about a possible war going on. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If they really are going on the premise of hiding their intentions in plain sight, wouldn't that mean there will be a wave that comes and gets rid of the non-vaccinated? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why would they give out a vaccine that gets rid of their main support group and leave those who are against it to be proved right? It kind of feels like a double edged sword if you look at it like that. Like screwed if you do because I truly believe there is something up with the vaccine itself ,kind of like a poison with benefits if that makes sense, and screwed if you don't because if there will be a deadly wave and the vaccine does protect against it...it's a wrap if you didn't get it unless you end up surviving it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't know. Maybe I'm just being paranoid but it just doesn't make sense to me for them to wipe out their base, even if it only sterilizes people and leaves them with other tragic side effects, if the real targets are those who won't submit.</p>
<p>Third times a charm. Been trying to upload it all day lol</p></p>

<li>No, it will <em>be</em> the second wave. Stray healthy, exercise, take vit c,d, zinc you'll be fine.</li>
<li>First priority is to reduce numbers. Easiest way to do that is through the mRNA, also multiple experts have highlighted risks such as increased risk of auto immune disease, liver failure etc... Directly tied to the Vax.</li>
<li>They want the numbers down. Other control measures will be in place for the uncooperative. IF you're thinking IS right (and I can follow you) then we're screwed either way.... So I'll personally not out anything directly in my body, and trust I can fight off anything floating about.</li>

        <p>I've been kind of thinking about that too. About the vaccine ensuring that people actually get sick this time, not that they weren't already getting sick before. And thank you for your response.</p>

        <p>Think about it this way, the main big players telling you that you need to get the vaccine are the same ones that think the population needs to be reduced in order to save the planet. Also, these are not actual vaccines according to the CDC guidelines of what a vaccine is. Example: You get vaccinated for TB. You are now immune from getting TB. You get the C19 shot and you still can get C19 and are being advised to still wear a mask and social distance. So what’s the point? There is stuff coming like Ivermectin which there is a 1 in 70 million chance it doesn’t work. And until that comes there’s always the HCQ, z-pack &amp; zinc method that works if taken immediately with the first symptoms.</p>

        <p>It's almost hard to process the fact they actually believe getting rid of 7/8th of the population will save the planet. Like where did that idea come from? It's pure evil, especially since they mean us and not them being sacrificed.
What you said about the corporations is why I'm leaning heavily into not getting it. It's what I told my buddies too, but they made me feel like I belong in a padded room after that lol.</p>

        <p>DuckDuckGo The Georgia Guidestones. Bill Gates is the main problem as well as Fauci the fraud. I’ve also been told I’m a wacko and asked where’s my tinfoil hat. Ha. I don’t care. Fuck em. Majority of my family and friends are liberal nut jobs so they believe anything the MSM tells them. They refuse to do the research themselves. There’s lots of good people on Gab since all the other social media sites are banning everyone going against the narrative. Example: I just got permanently banned from a few subs here just for answering you. Everyone I know under 60 that got both shots of whatever vaccine all felt like they got hit by a truck for a week. Who the hell knows what will happen a year from now or two years. The elites running the show don’t give a crap about us regular folk.</p>

        <p>one practical consideration if you are undecided is that the virus will return to extremely low levels in the summer months like it did last year so you can wait until the fall when there is more information</p>

        <p>yeah, same, that's why i'll likely never get it. but technically i'm just waiting and if the virus morphs into something super deadly or i get cancer, i might look at the vax differently. i think if you don't have a compelling reason to get the vax, don't get it. the scientists have offered their evidence. there is no compelling reason if you are healthy, they only have peer pressure for us.</p>
