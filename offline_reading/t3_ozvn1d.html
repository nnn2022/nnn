    <strong>My fianc√© got the vaccine today and I am upset</strong>
    <p><p>Has anyone had a significant other get the vaccine? I have shared with him everything I have seen and read and told him I was worried for his long term safety and I believed he should wait. He woke up this morning and got the vaccine anyway. His reasoning is that he trusts ‚Äúscience‚Äù and that he doesn‚Äôt want to die from covid. I feel that it is mainly because of pressure from his coworkers and friends. He is 28 and perfectly healthy. I am pro-choice when it comes to the vaccine but it‚Äôs sad to see someone so close to me give into this pressure. I am at a loss and I don‚Äôt know what to do or say. Anyone who has been in this situation - please advise. You can tell me I am just being dramatic and I probably am but I am hurt and scared.</p></p>

        <p>https://lookup.icann.org/lookup says that website is owned by "Instant Organic Garden", a 'business' (not actually legally registered as such) owned by this fellow. https://twitter.com/donrosenbergnc</p>
<p>Now you go to that website you posted and it says in the about page "We are an independent group of doctors, scientists, statisticians and concerned citizens who seek the truth about COVID-19"</p>
<p>So some dude who is illegally running a business and has a bunch of really out there posts on social media can be trusted in running a COVID information website?</p>
<p>EDIT: Seem's to be run by a church. https://1000covidstories.com/our-privacy-policy/ "COVID Study, 7200 E. WT Harris Blvd Charlotte, NC 28215"</p>
<p>EDIT2: https://covidstudy1.com/our-privacy-policy/ huh, why does a church have multiple websites like this? its almost as if someone is using this church to spread misinformation online.</p>
<p>EDIT3: IP lookup says both of these sites owned by "Instant Organic Garden". Why does Don Rosenburg need multiple domains like this? Why is he using a church address as his "business" address</p>

        <p>Yeah, dude is using COVID as a way to gather personal information to sell it. He's a moron. Emailed GoDaddy and the church that they're listing as their address. Also messaged Mr.Don Rosenberg on facebook to try and get some transparency on this but I doubt he'll reply. Gonna compile a document and send it to the FBI probably.</p>

        <p>Yeah I keep seeing people here and everywhere else use the VAERS data to try and prove that the vaccines has killed 6000 people.</p>
<p>From the VAERS website: 
&rt; Key considerations and limitations of VAERS data:</p>
<p>&rt;Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant health problem following vaccination to VAERS, whether or not they believe the vaccine was the cause.
Reports may include incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverified information.
The number of reports alone cannot be interpreted or used to reach conclusions about the existence, severity, frequency, or rates of problems associated with vaccines.
VAERS data are limited to vaccine adverse event reports received between 1990 and the most recent date for which data are available.
VAERS data do not represent all known safety information for a vaccine and should be interpreted in the context of other scientific information.</p>

        <p>I'm really sorry your fiance got the experimental gene therapy. My husband got it (J&amp;J/Janssen) a week ago and despite my heavy and protracted protests. He works for the government and had no choice although I was adamant he should try to fight it. I've been alternately furious and depressed since then. His brother got afib after getting the 2 Moderna jabs in March and his mother has afib so I fully expect him to develop it now and have his life shortened. One of the great tragedies of these so-called "vaccines" is there's no way to clear them and their effects from the body if/when it is proven conclusively and publicly that they do the harm many of us suspect. And, now, we (the spouses of the vaccinati) have to live with the probability that we'll catch the mutated viruses our spouses are shedding. You are not alone.</p>

<p>Of course, their long-term survivability may be cut short by cytotoxic spike protein damage. This could include heart damage, Leukemia, stroke, and other diseases related to a weakened immune system.

        <p>If it were me I'd call it off. </p>
<p>As much of a dick as I sound right now I just would not be able to trust that my partner was taking in anything that I was saying and processing it properly.</p>
<p>He trusts the science and doesn't want to die from Covid eh? So what is his opinion of you then? 
Does he secretly not value your opinion in the slightest? If so why is he marrying you?</p>
<p>What happens if the pandemic progresses the same road us "conspiracy theorists" think it's going down? Will he continue trusting the science and believing the government?</p>
<p>Personally think you guys need to sit down and have a discussion about this. This situation has the potential to be much more than a "I like blue, you like red" live and let live kind of topic. It has the potential to be world changing.</p>

        <p>These are things you can't have hanging over the relationship if you want to move forward. Talk to him.</p>
<p>I was dating a woman earlier this year and she was pro vaxx. Shower her everything I could. She told me she would do her research. Didn't realise that research meant news articles and she got the vaxx. Despite me asking her to wait.</p>
<p>I couldn't handle it and called it off. Was a shame but there was no getting through to her. I was open and she was just telling me whatever she could to avoid arguments and keep things smooth. There was no connection on the topic whatsoever, that line was dead.</p>
<p>It's a tough time for couples with opposing views.</p>

        <p>He obviously has a different opinion than you about this all, so you will have to accept it was his decision. He probably values your opinion, but not on this, and may never. To him, it seems like he thinks it isn‚Äôt a big deal to get it and risks aren‚Äôt something to consider, so he doesn‚Äôt want to hear about it from you.</p>
<p>If you want to maintain the relationship, the best thing to do may be to not discuss it anymore, but make your position known. You aren‚Äôt getting it and you‚Äôll do what it takes to avoid it. He will respect it, or not, then you can judge from there. </p>
<p>I‚Äôve been married for years and my wife got it as soon as she was able. I‚Äôve made it known that I won‚Äôt be getting it and masks are something I‚Äôm not doing more than I absolutely have to.  I try not to bother her too often with everything else I know about it. We have no covid relationship issues and mutual respect on plenty of other decisions. It works out just fine. </p>
<p>I will add that she‚Äôs coming around on her own by being in my proximity. She has completely stopped wearing masks anywhere that doesn‚Äôt require it.  She‚Äôs also no longer concerned about alpha, delta, or any other upcoming letters.</p>

        <p>I disagree, that would be almost the same as someone leaving their partner because they wouldn't get the vaccine. Both sides need to be tolerant or we'll never get through this without (more) civil unrest.</p>

        <p>My wife got the vaccine because her school wasn‚Äôt letting her work there without it this year. I told her to protest if, but she just gave in and got it. We‚Äôre both late 20s, healthy, and both already had COVID earlier this year. The important thing to know is that since you guys are both young and healthy, there‚Äôs not too many problems associated currently that we know. Just make sure he knows what your feelings are and why you feel that way. Being in a relationship is about understanding each other‚Äôs reasoning and being cooperative. Theres always this community to come back and talk to about your feelings as well as others in your life who think the same way you do.</p>

        <p>My husband got the J&amp;J shot back in April. I wasn‚Äôt happy about it but I knew ultimately it was his choice. It took me a little while to not feel angry about it but now I just hope and pray he doesn‚Äôt haven any long term effects from it. He is a teacher so I assume he would probably be forced to get it at some point anyway. Thankfully he completely supports my decision to not get it.  I hope your fianc√© also will have no long term effects.</p>

        <p>First off I'd get myself some NAC if I was going to be around him. </p>
<p>Then if you guys plan to have children, I'd have a talk about whether he would want to give them this vaccine. Even if he said he wouldn't, I'd still be hesitant. That's really a hill to die on type of issue. I mean for him getting vaxxed, it's his body, his choice but with children you guys need to be on the same page.</p>

        <p>It's an amino acid, lots of benefits for overall health but also good for treating covid and detoxifying. If I was going to be around someone recently vaxxed I'd def take it. In fact I did when my recently vaxxed mom came to visit and was coughing all over me. </p>

        <p>I think the issue here is that this is someone that you're planning on spending the rest of your life with. A lot of people here didn't have the benefit of seeing how their partner would react to extreme social pressures and the threat of authoritarian governed takeover. For people that are already married, they've already made their commitment. That's completely different from someone in your situation who isn't married yet. You may have an opportunity here to safe yourself from a lot of trouble and heartache in the future. </p>
<p>What do his actions in regard to everything that's happened in the last year say about his character? Is he the kind of strong man that you'll want to have in a marriage? I'm not trying to degrade him at all, but I'm sincerely asking, is the way that he is handling this Covid fiasco indicative of someone you want to commit your life to? BTW you absolutely don't have to answer these questions, these questions are for you to ponder yourself. </p>
<p>Also I want to reassure you,  deciding that someone isn't the person you want to spend your life with doesn't mean you don't love him or care about him deeply. But marriage is a huge commitment that should be taken seriously. You can deeply care about someone but still realize that they're not what you want. </p>
<p>There's a lot going on in the world right now and if it's me, I need someone by my side who is on the same page as I am. Furthermore, I would find it very discomforting if I had a partner who wasn't able to see the government and media manipulation going on around us for what it is. </p>
<p>Regardless, I wish you the best. I pray that God gives you guidance in making the right choice. Just remember, this isn't about hate or anything like that. Never hate your fiance for the choices he has made. Just remember that these are serious times and there are very real consequences to what is happening right now. All the best, God Bless!</p>

        <p>You are allowed to be sad, but guess what? It‚Äôs ultimately his choice. I want people to allow me the freedom to choose what is best for myself and my family, and I will likewise allow others to do the same. If they feel more comfortable wearing masks and being vaccinated, then it is not my place to say. All you can do is lead by example. Showing that you are in afraid gives courage to others.   </p>
<p>I have lived my life relatively normally since the pandemic began. I elected for my child to attend in-person school as soon as possible, instead of choosing virtual. Everyone initially hurled insults, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt care about the safety of your child; it‚Äôs better to keep kids home to keep them safe, etc.‚Äù But looking at the Covid risk for children, I was much more concerned that they would be negatively effected by loneliness, isolation, Learning loss, etc.  </p>
<p>Eventually, after ‚Äúbeing the guinea pigs‚Äù, people came around, and now most are electing for in-person school after seeing that we had a far better experience, and nothing bad happened to us and the other families who chose to carry on with their lives normally.</p>
