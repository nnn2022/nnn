        <p>Here's the design that backed the CDC recommendation for all pregnant women.</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983</p>
<p>I asked a vaccine safety public health educator, with a background in public health policy... why the CDC would recommend the vaccines for ALL pregnant women, when the only pregnancy design excluded 1st trimester data (when miscarriage risks are naturally highest), yet didn't error on the side of caution to recommend them for 2nd and 3rd trimester only.</p>
<p>(This in addition to the EUA vaccine fact sheets that still presently indicate pregnancy data population risks remain unknown, and when they are stuck under dead end CICP injury compensation route.)</p>
<p>I also pointed out how the VSAFE measure in the pregnancy design only relied on self identification of pregnancy, and self report throughout the design, opening a risk of corruption unbeknownst to the researchers that a third party with financial interests in the outcome could potentially pay participants to falsely report throughout the study, especially since no objective verification of pregnancy status was utilized at any point in the study, and especially since the majority of participants volunteered independently (majority were not solicited for participation by the researchers).</p>
<p>I also asked how the medDRA string code measure that pulls injury data from VAERS in this design was strengthened with lumping techniques (if strengthened at all), to mitigate quality weaknesses that previous publications had found with medDRA. Because previous publications did identify methods to strengthen it as a measure, but this design did not indicate any method to account for the limitations with string code measures that weaken the quality of injury data. (It's a malleable measure, and there was lack of transparency regarding how injury data was pulled with the measure).</p>
<p>I also asked how interrater/intercoder reliability was strengthened, as VAERS self report pdfs have open text boxes, meaning interraters are transcribing data to the VAERS table. The design failed to indicate how staff reliably transcribes data. Also nothing in the mandated and recommended VAERS reporting events was improved to account for thrombotic events like TIA which may not result in hospitalization and which could easily be misconstrued as anxiety by either VAERS or VSAFE staff. Even though thrombotic events were found in the animal mrna studies.</p>
<p>I also noticed that all participant safety intervention is dependent on providers, as VAERS and VSAFE websites clearly state they will not provide medical advice, even as the CDC claimed historically rigorous ongoing safety monitoring was occuring.</p>
<p>In light of all that, I wondered why the CDC's recommendation for ALL pregnant women regardless of trimester, didn't consider how frontline mothers in their first trimester may be mandated by employers to take unknown risks in their first trimester, when miscarriage risk is already highest. The CDC claimed that they believed any additional risk in the first trimester was unlikely (but did not base this reasoning on any data, only conjecture).</p>
<p>The vaccine educator ignored me until I connected with her University to complain. Then she responded by validating the limitations I pointed out, and only recommending that I reach out to VAERS myself. You have to know, that any one of my professors back in college would have easily notice the limitations I found and would have already reached out to VAERS just to learn more and speak to where the strengths and limits stood. But this vaccine public health educator who wanted to speak about the designs didn't? No other vaccine educators have answered these questions either.</p>

        <p>Careful. This is bait.</p>
<p>From the website: </p>
<p>&rt; The study, ‚ÄúPreliminary Findings of mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine Safety in Pregnant Persons‚Äù finds that covid vaccines cause spontaneous abortions in 104 out of 127 pregnant women! This means that the vaccine is disrupting critical stages of early prenatal development, and is killing four out of five babies in the first 20 weeks of gestation.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33882218/">From the exact paper that's being referenced:</a></p>
<p>&rt; calculated proportions of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in persons vaccinated against Covid-19 who had a completed pregnancy were similar to incidences reported in studies involving pregnant women that were conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<hr>
<p>&rt; Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>There is no reference in the entire study to these 104 out of 127 numbers.</p>
<p>Just another hoax website spreading fake news and hoping we'll be too dumb to check. We don't need lies to win the battle of ideas. But if we fall for bait like this we'll surely lose.</p>

        <p>The study they quote in the article cuts against the article‚Äôs point:</p>
<p>‚ÄúPreliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. However, more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.‚Äù</p>
<p>Just because there were negative pregnancy outcomes observed after getting the vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean these outcomes were statistically significantly from those who don‚Äôt get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>The study is lying. They point out that 104 out of 127 women vaccinated in the first trimester lost the baby. The normal rate of spontaneous abortion, or losing the child in the first trimester, is 20%. The study only focused on the total number of adverse events out of the 800+ women vaccinate, most of whom were further along.</p>

        <p>The study doesn't actually say that. There is no reference to a 127 number. The only reference to 104 is the total number of spontaneous abortions, out of 827 pregnancies.

        <p>From the Table 4</p>
<p>&rt; Data on pregnancy loss are based on 827 participants in the v-safe pregnancy registry who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine (BNT162b2 [Pfizer‚ÄìBioNTech] or mRNA-1273 [Moderna]) from December 14, 2020, to February 28, 2021, and who reported a completed pregnancy. A total of 700 participants (84.6%) received their first eligible dose in the third trimester. Data on neonatal outcomes are based on 724 live-born infants, including 12 sets of multiples.</p>
<p>So 700 participants were in the third trimester. That means 827 - 700 = 127 in the first or second trimester. As it says above,</p>

        <p>No, you're lying. Read the fucking study. </p>
<p>It was not conducted on 827 pregnant women. It was conducted on 3958 pregnant women. Of those 3958, 827 had either given birth, or had a miscarriage. About a third of those 3958 pregnancies were probably in their first trimester at the beginning of the study. So that means despite the 96 miscarriages that happened during the first trimester (which is when miscarriages happen 80% of the time), there were over 1200 other pregnancies that survived. The website claims that the spontaneous abortion rate was 80%. They pulled that number out of their ass. The real miscarriage rate was not actually affected by the vaccines, which the study clearly demonstrates if you read it.</p>
