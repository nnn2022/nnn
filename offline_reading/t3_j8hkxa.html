        <p>Exactly. And if you're asymptomatic then you are very unlikely to transmit. The WHO already said this, but then they immediately tried to backtrack and damage control - and Fauci said in January that asymptomatic carriers do not spread a pandemic. We are living in crazy land right now.</p>

        <p>It's so funny how the same ultra progressives who pushed for sex ed and "LMFAO religious people are so fucking stupid, you can't transmit aids you don't have, diseases don't just appear, babies aren't guaranteed every time there is sex 😂😂😂😂😂".   </p>
<p>But apparently if I don't wear a mask to sleep I will die and everyone in my house will die and then my neighbor I said good morning to without a mask on one time will also die and then in turn their whole family will also die.</p>

        <p>Those are all very bad comparisons. For one, one doesn’t transmit AIDS; it would be HIV. HIV is a virus, AIDS is a condition that may or may not result from HIV. You can have HIV without AIDS, but it’s impossible to have AIDS without first having HIV. </p>
<p>Second, you’re trying to compare two viruses that have entirely different modes of transmission and aren’t even on the same playing field as far as transmission goes, likewise for contagion factor. </p>
<p>Third, time for a biology lesson! Each sexual encounter does not result in a pregnancy, contrary to whatever it is you’re trying to say here. Aside from the fact that you didn’t specify <em>heterosexual</em> sex, which in itself completely blows your logic up like a grenade, assuming heterosexual sex is what you meant, ovulation is required for conception to occur and the fertile window following ovulation is only about 7 days on average, 10 at most. Even then, fertilization would need to occur and then successful implantation. </p>
<p>Further, what faulty logic you have to justify your actions. It’s very likely that should you contract covid, you’ll survive. This likelihood does not, however, automatically guarantee your health. It’s very possible you could end up a covid-longhauler, and experience long term lung damage, cardiovascular issues, neurological problems, etc. All of these have happened. It’s also very possible that you experience none of that, but one, some, or all of your family, friends, and neighbors, which you infected, do. If you can say in all conscience that you still wouldn’t care were that to happen to them, then you have a very selfish and defective moral compass. You don’t have to <em>kill</em> someone to be ruthless. Any harm you cause to another can be damaging, whether you consider it harmful or not is irrelevant here. </p>
<p>For want of a nail.</p>

        <p>Holy shit, calm down the preaching Pastor John. All sense of nuance and ad absurdum is always lost on bleeding heart grandstanding SJW types and its also why comedy is dead because you have no sense of humor or sarcasm.   </p>
<p>It's hilarious how my comment of absurdity is exactly what I got. The new generation of pastors and evangelicals. The progressive types.   </p>
<p>No shit it's HIV, no shit you don't always get the disease, no shit you don't always get pregnant, no fucking shit you absolute fucking retarded brainlet faggot. That is the point.   </p>
<p>It's a direct comparison to the preachers and evangelicals of the 80s-90s pushing that rhetoric with the stupid rhetoric today of how "you'll literally kill grandmas uwu".  </p>
<p>Being in a room with someone who has Covid won't automatically give it to you, and people with no virus have a 0% chance of transmitting it without a mask on. The infection rate isn't even that bad.  </p>
<p>And this is one of the pussiest beta "pandemics" in history. Embarrassingly low kill rate and really isn't living up to expectations. Its parents should be ashamed. It's been almost a year and these numbers have been slightly worse than seasonal flu numbers.   </p>
<p>Enjoy your face diaper, Pastor.</p>

        <p>They wore n95 masks so they were protected. Public should do the same so we can all stop fighting with each other.
Edit: I say this to mean if you want to "protect yourself" then you can do so without relying on the actions of others. This my mask protects you B/S needs to go. Be responsible for yourself.</p>

        <p>Why are you automatically assuming bad intentions on others? Projection perhaps? Have you not considered that people, I dunno, <em>care</em> about others beyond themselves? It speaks volumes more about the kind of person <em>you</em> are to assume people who actually care about the greater good are masquerading as such but actually have ulterior motives such as trying to prove their obedience and grandiosity to the world. Man, some of the mental gymnastics one must have to do to twist something so innocent. It’s contrivable, really.</p>

<p>I guess if that’s what you want to call ~35,000 deaths most of which occurred in the initial wave where they didn’t have enough ventilators.</p>
<p>You’re also looking at the total numbers of the country itself but I’m asking you to take a look at the hardest-struck hospitals like the one in my link. Which is still “much better” than the northern hospitals in the first wave.</p>
<p>And for the context, I posted that because the dude said no hospital was ever overwhelmed even without masks (??? Where has zero mask use right now). Like...I get having an opinion, but that’s just factually incorrect.</p>

        <p>If the concern is preventing health care systems from being overwhelmed, why aren’t hospitalization stats (which directly indicate whether a health care system is being overwhelmed) presented right alongside case stats? </p>
<p>If our concern is overwhelming the hospitals, and we have a really good, objective way to tell whether hospitals are overwhelmed (or on the way to being overwhelmed), why aren’t we at least equally focused on hospitalization stats?</p>

        <p>Cuomo's executive order forcing nursing homes in his state to take in Covid infected patients  is well known, by this point. Age was already established as a risk factor for death from Covid when he issued that order, so the death toll from his decision was entirely predictable.</p>
<p>Is there anything I just told you that you did not already know, u/Makelevi? To take a death toll that you know was engineered through the criminal misconduct of a power hungry elected official and use that as a basis for estimating the risk of spontaneous covid spread in the absence of a lockdown is intellectually dishonest. It's also comically bad statistical methodology.</p>
<p>Think of somebody holding a coin in his fingers, putting it down on a table heads up, 100 times, and then saying "see, this coin always comes up heads." We can all see why that conclusion would be absurd, can we not? The outcome of a rigged experiment doesn't establish anything other than the fact of somebody's willingness to rig an experiment. When Cuomo issued that unconscionable executive order, one for which he should be executed, in effect he rigged the experiment that Nature, itself, was running at the time, as Covid spread and claimed its victims. He knowingly acted in a way that greatly increased the death toll. What followed was not a revelation about the way Nature worked, but rather, one about how Cuomo operated - which is to say, without conscience.</p>
<p>Cuomo was such a psychopath that he was willing to guarantee the deaths of thousands of defenseless, innocent elders in nursing homes, just so he could get his way about the lockdown. And you're yet another psychopath who wants us to forget that. Says something about the kind of person you are, doesn't it?</p>

        <p>You're more right than you'll ever know.</p>
<p>It was the first attempt by the health-fascists to create and demonize a class of "Others", and it succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.</p>
<p>We went from from smoking everywhere, to designated areas, to glass pods, to being kicked outside. Some places have distance restrictions that literally, if followed, would force smokers to stand in traffic. You can't smoke in parks, at beaches, in your own car in some parking lots. Why? And at no point was the free market or personal and business choice allowed to sort the issue out.</p>
<p>It very quickly morphed from "health", to Puritan petty spite - hence the mewling about "third hand smoke".</p>
<p>Of late, MADD has been trying to run the same playbook with alcohol.</p>

        <p>If you watch any media from pre 2000, but especially pre-2010s,  it looks like a different world. The way they treat alcohol, smoking. It’s wild. I shudder to think what Rona will make things look like</p>

        <p>When I was a kid, I watched the original "Battlestar Galactica" (the 70's one, not the PC new versions). I downloaded the entire series, both because I enjoy it, and partly because it's a time capsule of a world before PC, safetyism, and before the Nanny State.</p>
<p>In one scene, Adama, Athena, Starbuck etc are having dinner. Boxy is sitting at the table, and Starbuck is puffing away on his signature cigar - right across the table from him. You would never get that scene on film now - someone would have apoplexy.</p>
<p>In England, school textbooks have photoshopped Churchill's cigar out of his pictures. The "memory hole" is real.</p>

        <p>Logic ... how does the mask manage to be an impenetrable barrier for things going outward, and at the same time not be one for things coming in? Are there little one way signs inside the mesh of the fabric, telling the droplets (and viruses) in which direction they're allowed to travel?

        <p>Seriously? You're going to whine about elitism, now? What happened to that great regard you doomers / maskers tell us that you have for Science?</p>
<p>How exactly are they going to do this experiment in a way that does not end with their "test results" being a figment of their imaginations? If the mask is tied tightly, the air passes through the mask. If not, the breeze at the edge will be hardly perceptible, if at all, so the challenge to "just try it" isn't as reasonable as it might sound to a naive reader. Looking for effects that fall below the threshold of sensory detection, people will often think that they've felt, heard or seen things that they really haven't.</p>
<p>But to move from Psychology (a subject you're obviously trying to put to bad use) back to Physics ...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The effect you're claiming is implausible, on physical grounds. On the microscopic scale, a molecule in the air, in responding to the forces around it, moves in a time reversible manner.</p>
<p>On the macroscopic scale, time reversibility is lost, but only because of the conversion of kinetic to heat energy, due to the inelastic collisions the molecules in the air are experiencing, mainly with the fabric of the mask. The laws of motion don't care about direction, so heat generation will be the same, going either way through or around the mask.</p>
<p>There is, of course, one difference between exhaling and inhaling - on inhalation, the air pressure behind a mask will drop, pulling the mask in toward one's face, tightening any seal, <em>reducing</em> the flow of air around the edges. On exhalation, pressure builds up behind the mask, shoving it away from one's face, <em>increasing</em> that same flow around the periphery, producing the opposite of the effect you're claiming.</p>
<p>Not just a theoretical effect - anybody who has had the misfortune of finding himself short of breath in a place where he is not allowed to take off the mask, no matter how much respiratory distress he is in, has experienced that effect in a not at all subtle manner, the mask being pulled over one's lips and bending inward over one's open mouth, as one gasps for breath like a dying fish; the experience that an N95 mask offers an asthmatic user, as I can report from personal experience, and others can, too.</p>
<p>In short, u/Veneck, you're full of it.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly so. If we go here</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2cb/comments/j6sxgy/combining_2cb_and_speed_amphetamine/g8156yk/">https://www.reddit.com/r/2cb/comments/j6sxgy/combining_2cb_and_speed_amphetamine/g8156yk/</a></p>
<p>we can see u/Veneck taking part in a discussion on a sub with this description:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<em>"The original and only subreddit dedicated to 2C-B, the psychedelic phenethylamine synthesized by Alexander Shulgin.  This subreddit is to promote harm reduction and safety, promote the  knowledge and awareness of 2C-B, and to be a space for constructive conversation."</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In other words, I've been discussing theoretical Physics, however briefly, with a druggie. If you choose to follow the link, you'll get to see u/Veneck talk about the ways in which his use of recreational drugs has enhanced his experiences masturbating. Truly, we are in the presence of greatness.   🙄</p>
<p>I made sure to archive that discussion. I don't think any more time needs to be spent on this individual, what passes for his thoughts, or any of his hallucinations.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, I am superior to you. This much should be obvious to any reasonable person by this point. Not that it's much of a boast.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;whatever good emotions you can muster in times of crisis.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How gracious of you, oh self-confessed troll.</p>

<p>&rt;If you're not trolling I'd suggest you reflect on the combative behavior  you're displaying, and how divisive the politics are becoming.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Translation: If I really cared about peace and love, I'd validate your ignorance and treat it as if it were just as valuable as actual science - and well tested science, at that.</p>
<p>The current "crisis," by now, should have shown even the most densest people around why I would not (and should not) agree to do such a thing - because when fantasy and reality are held to be of equal value in a discussion of the real world, all that remains to us is a slow descent into an increasingly horrifying collective madness. That a respect for the value of the truth is a value that decent people must affirm if they are to remain decent, and if feelings are hurt in the process, so be it.</p>
<p>The saddest part of this story is that a "crisis" would have to be created for people to see something that basic. What I just said is something that should be common sense for almost anybody over the age of seven, the so-called "age of reason," because without that recognition, there is no such thing as reason, at all.</p>
<p>Goodbye. Go troll somebody else.</p>

        <p>I see that u/Veneck, the druggie who was upset because I wouldn't validate his version of the science of Physics and because I used big words that he didn't understand, has decided to chime in again, bless his soul. He writes:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Dude I don't get this emotionally upset by real life events, </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>u/Veneck, dude, you're a troll. You've admitted to being a troll. I think that you know that you're an annoying person. Because you're that way, <em>deliberately</em>.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; you actually deleted your comment and rewrote it in a meaner tone. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For the record, that's a lie. There are a few comments I edited and added to, but none that I've deleted.</p>
<p>Not that there's anything inherently wrong with the act of deleting a comment, but BS is BS, and should be called out on general principle.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Be well, you're being fucked up by propaganda. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Again, I have an actual degree in Physics, which I put to very light use in replying to the nonsense put in front of me. The drug addled knob posting the nonsense gets his "science" from his fellow doomers, when he's not pulling it out of his posterior.</p>
<p>I trust that we all know what "projection" is?</p>

<p>So, by your own admission, you're a troll - and a troll with a drug habit, at that. Why should anybody take anything you have to say seriously?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Your explanation was expectedly arrogant and used a lot of fancy words </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's basic Physics, which I explained to you on a middle school level. If you feel threatened by that, that's a you problem.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;  There's so many things you said just for the sake of saying, </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Translation: I went over the empty head of a drug addict, when talking about a subject in which I have a degree. I would almost have to, wouldn't I?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; , remember we're talking about the dynamics of moving aerosolized particles,  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Pay a visit to Wikipedia so you could find some fancy words of your own, did you?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; it's all about understanding whether you can reduce the risk of getting a coronavirus aerosol into your face. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>A subject to which you have contributed no understanding whatsoever. Just a crank theory, which you've defended against critique with nothing more than a variant on the childish refrain "is not."</p>

<p>&rt; On a side note I hope your politics resolve to something that can foster cooperation instead of division </p>

<p>Don't think we need to hear that sermon from a troll. This, of course, is where I block you. Given Reddit's regrettable design choices, you'll still be able to reply to my posts, of course. You just won't be able to waste any more of my time.</p>

        <p>This is the result of the "Nanny State" -- the state who pretends to be your parents -- where you are the child who can't think for yourself.</p>
<p>European's are 'subjects of the crown' where hundreds of years ago 'the crown'' realized that he (or she) was outnumbered considerably and if 'the people' actually realized their advantage, could easily overthrow the monarchy. So to prevent this, the crown decided to 'give back' to his people with various bribes - health care is one of them.</p>
<p>In the US, there is no loyalty to 'the crown', and up until about 50 years ago, citizens were <em>fiercly independant</em>, especially after WWII. As the US government became more corrupt in it's expansion, they started taking on the 'nanny state' role of citizen 'dependance' just as Saul Alinsky described in his book 'Rules for Radicals'.</p>

        <p>Why are they out of their homes if they care about spreading disease to others? The masks are, at best, 20% effective which means there's an 80% chance they could still spread it. How can they justify doing something so dangerous? Don't they know there's a pandemic?</p>

        <p>i forget where i heard this or read this, but if 200,000 people wore a mask correctly at all times (while interacting with other people), 1 infection would be prevented.</p>
<p>in the U.S., we have a population of 330 million; if my math checks out, we could prevent 1,650 infections.</p>

        <p>I think there’s a difference between ‘responsible’ and ‘able to make a difference’.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t say that any one person should be <em>required</em> to wear a mask specifically so that others (statistically) won’t catch Covid, but I also definitely understand how flabbergasted people can be at the sheer discompassion exhibited.</p>

        <p>What is truly uncompassionate is perpetuating a climate of fear and anxiety. That’s all that masks do effectively. And wearing one is hateful because you are a complicit participant in the propaganda.</p>
