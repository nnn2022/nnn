    <strong>Why not a new normal?</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve enjoyed the last year.  More time with my husband and kids with everyone working and learning at home.  No commutes, no rush to get out the door.  Just a slower happier way of life.  I didn’t have to bust my in laws or have them over.  No weddings or showers which always suck. 
What is not to love about the change?<br>
Of course I don’t want illness or job loss but I’d keep the distancing and masks forever.  I haven’t had even a cold in a year.  I don’t miss that.  And shopping incognito in a small town is wonderful.  No boring time wasting small talk.
I’m just trying to understand the outrage over something that has made my life so much better.
I think many introverts are happier.</p></p>

        <p>My main job has been work from home for the last 13 months, when I normally would have had to drive in traffic just to get to the office. Has it made my job easier? Of course. Would I wish a never ending global pandemic on the world just so I could live in comfort? Of course not! And I say this as an introvert too who in a way has benefitted somewhat from COVID lifestyle. I’m just able to understand that this has hurt so many people, emotionally and financially. </p>
<p>Everyone should be able to make their own decisions as to how they live their lives. OP on the other hand, thinks that she needs a global pandemic and strong government control in order to be an introvert.</p>

        <p>Tell that to all of the people who haven’t been able to work since last March. Tell that to all of the people who lost family members for reasons beyond COVID and weren’t able to say their final goodbyes. Tell that to all of the business owners who lost their business they worked their whole life for. Tell that to all those who lost loved ones who committed suicide because they didn’t enjoy being in solitude as much as you do. </p>
<p>Your selfishness is the problem. You’re free to stay at home and live your “new normal”, but you’re insanely self centered if you wish suffering on others so that YOU can live a comfortable life. <em>You</em> are part of the reason we are still in this situation.</p>

        <p>So you don't care about the 100's of thousands of small business owners who are now bankrupt, the children and teens who are now killing themselves due to isolation or inescapable abuse situations at home, the ticking time bomb of missed cancer screenings and treatments, the elderly people who are being quite literally locked into their rooms in care homes without being able to see their families in person for the better part of a year, the essential workers who are forced to wear masks for the duration if their 8-12 hours shifts (not just for 1/2 an hour while shopping at a store).... as long as your privileged, lazy ass gets to cower at home off the sweat of others?</p>

<p>Without people like you the whole situation would have been so much more difficult to manipulate. They depend on the sheep-like humans, the ones who can't think for themselves. Just go back to sleep dear and enjoy your self centred existence.</p>

        <p>Again, it’s all about you you you. Just proving again how selfish you are. Do you not understand that this has varying impacts on everyone? You just happen to be in the small, priveleged minority who enjoys this. </p>
<p>Just because forcing millions of people out of their job and livelihoods while not being able to see loved ones doesn’t affect YOU in a negative way, doesn’t mean that it doesn’t hurt millions of others. I lost my part time job that I loved. I know people who committed suicide because they couldn’t handle not being able to see family and friends.

        <p>So all introverts support extreme government control that creates domestic abuse, a collapsing economy and job losses, suicides, and depression? How in the hell can you be so ignorant that you can’t see how the same thing has negative impacts on the entire population as a whole — some more than others? I would NEVER wish something that hurts others so long as it benefits me. I can’t believe that I’m wasting my time trying to explain a basic life lesson that is meant for a 4-year old.</p>

Get off social media, examine your priorities, downsize your life, drop expenses or whatever you need to do, to have the life you want with your kids without sacrificing their future for your selfish needs.

        <p>I would never put my needs ahead of theirs.  You’ve got me wrong there.  Social media helps because it provides adult conversation with out the burden of friendship.  I don’t have anything to offer friends right now.  I simply have no energy beyond what my family needs.  Hope that makes sense.</p>

        <p>There doesn’t need to be a pandemic to avoid going to weddings, seeing the in-laws, or justify spending time with your family. The beauty of mental freedom is you have the right to say no to any of the things you don’t want to do. 
Many people are extroverts and it doesn’t seem right to force people into becoming introverted.
Everyone should be able to live the life they want. “Pandemic” or not.
Personally I like going to weddings. But I’d never shit talk someone who doesn’t like them</p>
<p>Edit: to add, as a career bartender, masks and restrictions have taken all of the joy from my job. My job is to be social. No bar guests and me having to show emotion purely from my eyes is living hell to me</p>

        <p>We can keep WFH, but ditch the mandatory masks and distancing. If YOU want to wear a mask long after the pandemic is over, be my guest. But you have no right to force others to do so.</p>

        <p>I spend most of my time at home as well (before this and obviously during this), but do I embrace this as the new normal??  ABSOLUTELY NOT!  The few joys I did have (gym, tanning, seeing the odd friend I chose to see, the odd meal out) has been taken away for absolutely NO valid reason.  </p>
<p>But much more important than that - the thousands of people who have lost their businesses even though they were doing everything right - how can you be ok with that?  How can you say because you like spending time at home and wearing your mask all the time that everyone else should have to suffer because you are more comfortable this way?</p>

        <p>Hopefully OP you are not attempting to troll us but if you are, here is my response to you:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I’ve enjoyed the last year. </p>
<p>Clearly not every shares your enjoyment of the last 365 days on the planet. In particular those who lost their jobs because the GOVERNMENT, not COVID-19, told them they're not essential and they must stay home.</p>
<p>&rt; What is not to love about the change? </p>
<p>Are you referring to the people to the change that the government instituted in the lives of millions of Americans who have lost their jobs, homes, livelihoods and businesses? That change? If this is love, then I am sure you would love the bridge I am selling over the Atlantic with the 360 view, and 3 car garage!</p>
<p>&rt;  I’m just trying to understand the outrage over something that has made my life so much better. </p>
<p>Please tell this to the mom-and-pop businesses that were open for years, and were forced to close up shop because of something "that has made my life so much better." Also, tell this to people who lost everything or something of value because this made your life "so much better," like their freedom.</p>
<p>I am sorry, but this kind of change is a detriment to at least our American society because it is based on liberty even in the worse and best of times. You are the type of mom that would applaud Hitler's changes to Germany because it would most likely "has made your life so much better" without looking at the long term implications and burden you are ignorantly and willingly putting on your children, your grandchildren, and your children's grandchildren.</p>

        <p>I’m not trolling.  I get your point.  I think the thing to hang on to is the lack of social expectations.  It’s hard for introverts.  I’m hoping I can find reasons to keep saying no.  I would have never known how much happier I would be shedding those expectations if Covid hadn’t happened.</p>

        <p>I get your position, and believe me, I understand the notion of being an introvert and the social norms that come with it. However, I would like to bring to your attention the implications of this change.</p>
<p>Think about that! The change was done in just a year; it will have implications for years to come. Those people that committed suicide because they lost everything, remember them? They're not coming back. The cure for this alleged virus is worse then the virus itself, and this was done all in the name of "protecting you." I would hate to see what would happen when the government decides to openly not protect you. I wonder then if you would appreciate those changes.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, I am not a parent, so I can not understand what it is like to be one or comprehend the implications of being one. I am speaking in terms of an average Joe from Kokomo.</p>

        <p>You don't seem to account for people who have anxiety over the mask. I didn't say anything about not breathing. However, the masks do limit your ability to breathe properly. The biggest question is why do people THAT HAVE BEEN VACCINATED have to continue to wear them? Wasn't the point of vaccines is to help the folks who are most vulnerable avoid severe Covid Illness?</p>

        <p>How could anyone be anxious about a little paper mask?  You can use less makeup and avoid that annoying PTA chairwoman in the produce isle.<br>
Once enough people are vaccinated they will lift the mask orders.  Stores have no idea who is vaccinated and people will lie.  Unvaccinated people will see others without a mask and think it’s safe for them as well.  Just be patient.  Once we all get the shot it will change.</p>

From no lockdowns and no masks to all the sudden lockdowns and masks work. What vaccinated and unvaccinated people can or cannot do around each other. It's been a nightmare.</p>

        <p>That doesn’t help me understand your anger.  Wasn’t there anything you were happy to avoid.  A visit with your mother in law, a parent teacher conference, church committee meeting, local government meeting?  Nothing you had to do that Covid freed you from?</p>

        <p>I've noticed lots of women doing this, looking for positives in any situation. Gotta be cultural... wasn't much choice about who you marry (who marries you) and what you do for, like, millenia.</p>

        <p>I can’t be the only woman who was relived to be rid of social pressure.  We have to do most of the planning, prep work for any gathering.  It’s exhausting and often thankless.</p>

        <p>Well I'm pretty opposite of you in most senses and the social pressure didn't decrease. I had an office job and it turned into forced home office, and on a schedule there would be zoom meetings where you'd have to report how productive you'd been. When I complained about it being hard to stay productive staying in a cage (no land here... just a 40m apartment) they offered to bring me some furniture. Before I'd walk to the office every day (sure, not a commute) and get to interact with colleagues, which is social but rarely an obligation. Fired since then, 0 interaction with actual society now. The pressure is still there in the form "find a job find a job find a job you loser".</p>
<p>I guess it comes down to being useful. Food production is super useful. What I was doing was basically worthless so I and many of the rest got tossed into the trash and it hurts. Btw I was fired but still get the pay! Doubly insulting, and a giant waste of course.</p>
