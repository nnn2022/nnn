        <p>Please everybody; STOP running on the hamster wheel of incessant mask debate, and start learning and talking about the things that people <strong>CAN DO</strong> for themselves to help their immune systems function properly instead of injuring or killing them when challenged with weak pathogens such as SARS2 virus or influenza virus.</p>

        <p>Take vitamin d and get fresh air! Quercetin and zinc are said to help as well. Removing the mask I'm sure helps as well. Good suggestion though</p>

        <p>That's a great start!  The human immune system requires about two dozen different nutrients to function properly, including several that the body needs in general to properly metabolize those.</p>
<p>The complete list of nutrients that are required by the immune system or that the body uses to properly metabolize those is:
Vitamins: A, B complex, C, D, E, K2 Mk7 (as well as K1 and K2 Mk4), and the minerals: magnesium, calcium, potassium, zinc, copper, iron, phosphorus, boron, selenium, molybdenum, and manganese.</p>
<p>The immune system requires good healthy and reasonably properly proportioned amounts of ALL of those.</p>
<p>Study after study, survey after survey, paper after paper shows us that significant portions of the population in all age groups in every nation around the world don't even get the bare minimums of one or more of those, much less the good healthy amounts.  The statistics are dramatically worse for certain population cross sections such as the elderly, the obese, and T2DM patients.</p>
<p>There's a bunch of COVID specific papers that relate nutritional status for several of those with good or bad hospital patient outcomes.</p>
<p>There's also a whole bunch of other nutrients that the immune system can opportunistically make use of such as baking soda, L-citrulline, and lecithin, and a bunch of phytonutrients (yes, including quercetin), for some examples.</p>
<p>For many decades now, the food industry has hardly been trying to help people be healthy; they're trying to grab up profit off of people.</p>
<p>It's up to us to use The Power Of The People to care about our own immune systems being healthy.</p>

        <p>If only this knowledge was widely distributed. People eat shit food(I'm no Saint here) and wonder why they have chronic disorders. It's a shame really how easily people fell for the marketing tactics of big ag pharma etc</p>
