    <strong>Some honest questions</strong>
    <p><p>I just want a discussion, i don’t want a fight, or a ban, or whatever else can be thrown my way. I have a few questions that I would like answered though.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>what’s wrong with a new normal that is arguably safer than the “old” normal ( i guess that’s how i’ll refer to it?) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have seen those who oppose the COVID vaccine, but won’t the vaccine achieve what you all want? with a vaccine widespread, stuff like masks and social distancing will no longer be needed, thus making there be no new normal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is true that stuff like the vaccine passport is just the government wanting to control us even more, what about stuff like I.D, drivers licenses, regular passports, ect.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m not trying to start some huge fight or debate. I just want a few things cleared up. I specifically left politics out of it, and i’m not going to be talking about the politics of it all, honestly it never ends well for anyone.</p></p>

<p>It's not sufficient to point out one positive; you have to do a cost-benefit analysis. This is what economists are for. Can you link me where such an analysis has been done? And remember, the onus is on the one advocating for major societal change to provide the support. </p>
<p>&rt;I have seen those who oppose the COVID vaccine, but won’t the vaccine achieve what you all want?</p>
<p>The two do not seem to be connected - in my state it required to wear a mask, social distance, do health checks, limit capacity indoors, etc, even after having a vaccine. </p>
<p>&rt;If it is true that stuff like the vaccine passport is just the government wanting to control us even more, what about stuff like I.D, drivers licenses, regular passports, ect.</p>
<p>Listing a bunch of government controls doesn't invalidate a criticism of a government control.</p>

<p>i have heard this answer quite a few times, and i’m still not fully understanding it, so it’s about the economy and all that, forgive my ignorance but would you mind elaborating? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yeah, that’s true, even with the vaccine, many still have to abide by the restrictions, but once a majority/everyone is vaccinated, we will have no need for the restrictions, and a new normal is not created. if we keep holding out, it may naturally become the new normal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that’s true, i answered this below, I forget which reply, you should be able to find it, but I basically lay out what I meant by that. I can edit this and paste my thoughts here for convince if you want!</p>

        <p>&rt; so it’s about the economy and all that, forgive my ignorance but would you mind elaborating?</p>
<p>It's a pros and cons list. It's not about the economy, though that is one component, it's an attempt to take all the positive and negative outcomes and come out with an (as far as is possible) objective calculation about utility. QALYs is the typical way lives are considered, and it's a fairly straightforward conversion between QALYs and dollars. This cost-benefit process is done before any major project in the private sector, and almost all major projects in the public sector, including new legislation. GAO does this constantly in the US for the federal government.</p>
<p>So can you link me to a cost-benefit analysis done for the comprehensive COVID policy?</p>
<p>&rt;but once a majority/everyone is vaccinated, we will have no need for the restrictions, and a new normal is not created.</p>
<p>Everyone will never be vaccinated for a number of reasons. Can you show me some evidence that restrictions will go away when a majority of people are vaccinated? Particularly given opinion <a href="https://theconversation.com/amp/new-covid-variants-have-changed-the-game-and-vaccines-will-not-be-enough-we-need-global-maximum-suppression-157870">like this</a> from people who sit on government advisory panels (literally the people that wrote that are writing policy)?</p>

        <p>1) nothing is safe about a dictatorship stripping you of your medical freedoms and natural law</p>
<p>2) I can't even entertain this dystopian thought process. </p>
<p>3) It may just be me, however  being required to have a photo ID to travel versus being required to have a known deadly medical genetic experiment  I actually see as two different things... the first thing is a voluntary and not against anyone's medical freedom, the second I see as violating medical freedoms and natural law.</p>
<p>I think I would start with other questions here, such as why this was never about a pathogenic virus in the first place. Are vaccines even safe? Effective? Are masks safe? Effective? are there crimes against humanity being committed right now? Is the PCR a valid and reliable diagnostic tool? Are we currently experiencing genocide? MAybe some questions like those. </p>
<p>Did you know right now, a second Nuremberg tribunal that is in preparation, with a class action lawsuit being set up under the aegis of thousands of lawyers worldwide behind the American-German lawyer Reiner Fuellmich, who is prosecuting those responsible for the Covid-19 scandal manipulated by the Davos Forum.  </p>
<p>In this respect, it is worth recalling that Reiner Fuellmich is the lawyer who succeeded in condemning the automobile giant Volkswagen in the case of the tampered catalytic converters. And it is this same lawyer who succeeded in condemning Deutsche Bank as a criminal enterprise.  </p>
<p>According to Reiner Fuellmich, all the frauds committed by German companies are derisory compared to the damage that the Covid-19 crisis has caused and continues to cause. This Covid-19 crisis should be renamed the “Covid-19 Scandal” and all those responsible should be prosecuted for civil damages due to manipulations and falsified test protocols. Therefore, an international network of business lawyers will plead the biggest tort case of all time, the Covid-19 fraud scandal, which has meanwhile turned into the biggest crime against humanity ever committed.  </p>
<p>A Covid-19 commission of enquiry has been set up on the initiative of a group of German lawyers with the aim of bringing an international class action lawsuit using Anglo-Saxon law. Here is the summarized translation of the last communication of Dr. Fuellmich of 15/02/2021  </p>
<p>The hearings of around 100 internationally renowned scientists, doctors, economists and lawyers, which have been conducted by the Berlin Commission of Inquiry into the Covid-19 affair since 10.07.2020, have in the meantime shown with a probability close to certainty that the Covid- 19 scandal was at no time a health issue. Rather, it was about solidifying the illegitimate power (illegitimate because it was obtained by criminal methods) of the corrupt “Davos clique” by transferring the wealth of the people to the members of the Davos clique, destroying, among other things, small &amp; medium-sized enterprises in particular. etc. Platforms such as Amazon, Google, Uber, etc. could thus appropriate their market share and wealth.</p>

<p>Safer than the old normal in what way?  Lockdowns and isolation is mentally and emotionally damaging to a large number of the population. Even those who identify as introverts are feeling the strain of isolation. The inability of children to see the faces of others for the majority of their day at school are not learning the facial queues needed to understand people non-verbally. Multiple studies, including by the CDC prior to 2020 have shown the inefficiency of masks in spreading viruses. A comparison of infections in states that do not now or never had a mask mandate vs California or New York should be very telling. Nobody has been made safer due to these mandates.  So please explain how we are safer under these stricter rules? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, this vaccine is untested for long term issues. It is being issued under and emergency use order meaning there are no repercussions to the makers for any detrimental effects. 0.16% of the US population has died with the virus in their system over the course of a year.  Hardly a plague that demands a rushed vaccine. In terms of a vaccine this is about the poorest excuse for one. It’s greatest benefit is lessened symptoms. No immunity. No inability to spread the virus. It’s a joke. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are correct in the fact that this is one more “license” dictated by the government. In the US you need a license to get married, drive, fish, hunt, carry a concealed weapon, gather rain water, etc. more overreach. More control.</p>

<li>I was not referring to the lockdown, believe me i’m sick of it as well. more I was referring to the masks + social distancing. while I don’t want to be wearing masks and social distancing afterwards, science shows that participating in those actions does reduce the risk of catching disease from others. </li>
</ol>
<p>2.Let me answer this with a question (tacky, i know) but would you rather A. have a quickly produced vaccine for a worldwide virus that has killed millions, has changed our lives for the worse, and overall has been the bane of humanity’s existence for the past year, or B let COVID reign supreme as scientists wait to test long term effects, whist also preventing what you all support from happening. Answer B forces a new normal, answer A, while may be a little unpredictable, is clearly the better for everyone. plus “long term effects” are not commonly that bad. I know people are skeptical, I am too, but I don’t think people are gonna be turning in hulk like monsters 5 years after getting the vaccine. </p>
<ol>
<li>yeah, i recognize that the government controls a lot about us, but the vaccine passports are kinda not new in a sense. let’s look at a school,  kids that go to most (if not all, i forget if it’s federal or state) public schools must be vaccinated for stuff like measles. in order to prove this, doctors forms must be shown to prove that yes, this child will not cause a measles outbreak at school. And commonly other countries have had rules similar to this. vaccines are important in eradicating diseases, I don’t see this as another way to “control” people. it’s simply like taking those doctors notes to prove that you are not going to cause a COVID outbreak.</li>

<p>I again ask you to show the proof that masks and distancing work. Texas is an excellent example. Since the elimination of their mask mandates their numbers have fallen. Sweden has not issued mandates. Their deaths (.13%) are less than that of the US (.16%) and less than California (.15%). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Worldwide there have been 2.8 million covid deaths, or .03% of the population. Less than one half of one percent. The majority of these deaths have been of those over the age of life expectancy.  This is not the plague. Many will argue that if it had not been for strict control the numbers would be exponentially higher. We will never know if that is true, but again looking at Sweden as a barometer, it appears not to be the case. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measles is a good example of an effective vaccine. Following a measles vaccine do children then have to limit social interaction with others, or can they continue to spread the virus?  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What I really think this whole situation boils down to is life experience. I could be completely wrong, but you strike me as a young person. Late teens or early 20s. I don’t trust the government to do anything other than try and get more power which translates to higher taxes which puts more money into the pockets of politicians and their friends. Tech is pushing for passports. Why?  Who will build, sell and maintain these apps? Who will benefit through campaign contributions by awarding companies these contracts?  Even in the covid relief bill that just passed for $1.9 trillion, a representative from NY was boasting that there was ONLY $10 billion dollars of waste in the bill. </p>
<p>Sorry to go on a bit of a rant, but this is happening worldwide. The longer you pay attention and the more you follow the money, the less you will believe that government is your friend. As Reagan said, The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'</p>

        <p>I understand how politics fit into all of this, believe me. I just choose not to speak about my views because once it starts with politics, it eventually gets super personal, and personal insults and stuff like that gets nowhere, and is just not productive in a discussion that does not rely on it. unless i am wrong, of course.</p>

        <p>K your third point talks about government control..that's a political topic. And even if you don't explicitly state it, we can tell what your views are. Your views are that we already have all these types of ID, so why get so bothered about one more?</p>

        <p>I will set the record straight! I am Moroccan and your political opinions are really the least of my concerns. I was talking about the elitist and globalist policy which is at work today by creating a false pandemic. the very fact that I am on this sub to tell you about this scam should normally put you on the alert. there are anti masks and anti fascism all over the world, because this shit is global, and has nothing to do with your regional or local political ideas. the whole world is literally slipping into tyranny, and by putting on masks and subscribing to fear porn you are only associating yourself with this scam.<em>📷</em></p>

        <p>I think it is extremely naïve to believe that current public regulations will disappear because everyone is vaccinated. Government nor mainstream media claims that, you will still need to take all precautions even after you take the vaccine. People are worried that there won't be an end, as predicted over a year ago now.</p>

        <p>true, true. whilst i think that as long as the vaccine in not widespread and most if not everyone is vaccinated, taking the precautions are an important and nessicary step, but once everyone is vaccinated, i highly doubt people will still be socially distancing and wearing masks. even though i think those things are good in the current pandemic, believe me I can’t wait to walk outside and not worry about 6 feet or masks again.</p>

        <p>New normal vs old normal: it's not intrinsically safer, in that your probability of dying from any given cause is not appreciably different. And the cost for this not-appreciably-different level of safety is continued government overreach on basic human-rights freedoms such as, but not limited to, privacy.</p>

        <p>&rt;what’s wrong with a new normal that is arguably safer than the “old” normal ( i guess that’s how i’ll refer to it?)</p>
<p>I would 100% have to disagree with this. We are making nothing safer. Even if you think we are protecting people from a virus, we are going making later mutations of the virus stronger!</p>
<p>Forever weaker viruses that do not kill their host are the most prominent viruses in the world because if a virus kills the host the virus cannot reproduce. Now we know this virus has an extremely low death rate and with the social distancing we are making a super virus. </p>
<p>Think about it, we are all supposed to stay 6 feet apart... but what if I virus travels 7. or we wear masks that prevent large droplets, so now a common virus strain is one that can move through smaller droplets that escape masks. We are isolating ourselves, some people never leaving their house, getting exercise or taking proper vitamins. </p>
<p>There is nothing safe about this. We are literally making a super corona virus</p>

<li>Safety dosent mean better. Is this preserved safety better than quality of life? I'd rather live a full life with all its dangers, then lock myself away in my room to hide from theoretical threats. What's the point of living if you cant feel alive.
And what this is doing to the childern is criminal, to think that this is all nessicary and not notice that something is really wrong just so how easily brainwashed you've been. Sacrifice the young to protect the old mentality is sick, feel shame.</li>
<li>Brand new untested unapproved "vaccine" no thanks. Specially for a virus with a 99.97% survival rate, I have a much better chance with the virus then I feel I would with the vaccine, that's a chance I'm not willing to take.</li>
<li>The difference with a vaccine passport and licences, one has you show that you are a citizen/have had proper training to drive shoot a fire arm ect. The vaccine is having something forced into you're body that you do not want. I'm ok with having taken a drivers ed course and test to prove that I can be safe, forcing me to take something into my body when I dont know the effects is absolute bullshit</li>

<p>don’t take this as a personal attack, but I find that incredibly selfish. for example, let’s say I could make 1,000$ every time I hit a button (this represent going outside and not following covid restrictions, visiting old family without a mask, stuff like that) but every time I hit the button, somebody had a high chance of dying that moment (obviously, it’s sped up in the simulation) would you press the button? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite the many criticisms, these vaccines that are being majorly distributed were trialed, tested, and passed. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>technically, you are not forced to take the vaccine, if you don’t want it you don’t have to take it, simple as that. but the vaccine comes with added privileges, other country’s don’t want unvaccinated Americans coming into their countries and spreading the virus even more. and it’s not just America that has this system (or a similar system) set in place</p>

        <p>Ok so point 2, you do realize that they have not been approved by the fda and are not finished trials? They've been given emergency use, you're phase 3 trials. I have a higher chance of dying from the vaccine then I do of covid. And as said before stay home if you're scared of a .04% chance of death, I'd like to live mine thank you very much</p>

<li>The new normal that is being pushed is fascism. No question about it.</li>
<li>To ask people to take an experimental vaccine is unethical, and to ask or even demand people take something for a virus that has a 99.96% survival rate is nonsense. You tell me would you rather get a virus (like the flu)  that you will survive and have natural antibodies that will protect you against further contamination. Or take an experimental vaccine we know very little about and have a very real risk of side effects that you would live with the rest of your life or kill you?</li>
<li>I.D. helps you buy things that you need proof of a certainty age for like alcohol or tobacco. A driver's license does not permit or limit travel. A driver license is an operator's license giving proof you have the appropriate training to drive a motor vehicle. Passports are for entering other countrys because most countries protect their borders, and they want to know who they are letting in, and their criminal background. For example if you are from the US and have multiple DUIs (drunk driving charges) Canada will not allow you to enter. </li>
