        <p>He didn’t mean literally cancelled - they meant the entire media turned on him. And he caved - and called himself a moron for saying it. </p>
<p>Lost a lot of respect for him, not that I had much to begin with.  He was just told he’s not allowed to have an opinion on this vaccine and he went along with it. He chose his corporate overlords over the people. He knows damn well that a healthy 20 year old doesn’t need an emergency use vaccine. </p>
<p>But more importantly - someone in his position needs to be hyper aware of censorship and to call it out fiercely when it’s occurring.</p>

        <p>He calls himself a moron as a disclaimer often. And no one cancelled him. I think the word “cancelled” is becoming broader and broader to the point that it has no solid meaning. If any negative consequence to an action is “cancelled,” then parents cancel their children when they misbehave in public. Or cops cancel speeders by giving them tickets.</p>

        <p>I watch his podcast. Have been watching it for at least 3 years. He has changed his mind many, many times. For instance, he used to believe the moon landing was fake. Now he thinks it's real. He always says he's a moron, even before this, does this sound like Rogan to you "I'm just a moron who listens to the intelligent experts"? Because he's said that a hundred times if not more. He's been saying that for years now.</p>

        <p>I watch Rogan religiously. Shit's entertaining and interesting as it gets. He explained he changed his mind after speaking to experts. He literally said this. No. I will not go through fucking days worth of podcasts to find him saying it, but he did. More than once. You seem to forget he actually hangs out with scientits. Stop it.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you have to read between the lines. And I won’t stop it. </p>
<p>You can believe he changed his mind all you want - he hangs out with scientists and yet was adamant in his original podcast when he said that a healthy 20 year old was at such low risk he wouldn’t take the emergency use vaccine in that situation. This is a completely valid statement. </p>
<p>This was very bad for pharma, you can’t have arguably the most influential person for males between 20-50 telling people to not take your product. So pharma does what they always do - they attack and work to destroy the credibility and lives of the threat - they do this to scientists and to anyone who threatens their money maker. The so called ‘experts’ - bought and paid for by pharma. Main stream media - bought and paid for by pharma. Politicians, bought and paid for by pharma. Look at all the players who attacked him for a comment that he was completely justified in making. Why in the world would a healthy 20 year old who has over a 99.99% survival rate against Covid take an emergency use vaccine that has zero long term safety data - what is the upside? To add 0.009% to their survival odds? </p>
<p>Joe saw a trillion dollar industry flexing their muscles, getting ready to rip him to shreds and he spooked. That is what happened. </p>
<p>But sure - keep thinking he just spoke to a few experts and changed his mind.</p>

        <p>Why should young people take on the risk of a the most rushed medical intervention in human history to protect those at higher risk? Did those at risk give two seconds thought about the risk they put on the youth when they shut down their entire lives and skyrocketed depression, mental health, suicides, over doses and more? Did they care about the countless lives they destroyed, the increases in domestic violence? No they didn’t - they cared only about themselves. </p>
<p>If the vaccine does what it supposed the at risk can get it. And if they don’t want to they are well within their rights to take on that risk.</p>

        <p>like the flu vaccine everyone should make the decision for themselves.<br>
the flu is way more dangerous to kids and young adults than COVID.<br>
yet only a very small percentage in that age group is getting a flu shot biannually or even annually.</p>
<p>we did not pressure people into taking it or called them anti-vaxxers for not taking it before.<br>
nor should we this time.</p>
<p>if you are young and/or trust your immune system its perfectly fine to skip the vaccine.  </p>
<p>you would have to take every underlying condition of every death in a respective age group into consideration to really assess the risks of COVID.<br>
statistically for anyone below 55 (not joking here) COVID is less harmfull than the flu. more contagious, but less harmful.<br>
for anyone below 22 the flu is DRASTICALLY more harmfull than COVID.</p>

        <p>It’s unbelievable how misinformed you are,
First off kids can’t even get the COVID vaccine (I believe under 16 in most countries). </p>
<p>We can talk about death rates in a second, first let’s talk about infection. If someone has a flu they are only infectious for a few days and they are well aware they have the flu, they stay home and in a vast majority of cases they recover fully. COVID takes much longer to show symptoms, and sometimes gives someone no symptoms even if they’re infected. When you have that with a highly infectious disease you have situations where there are outbreaks at workplaces, among families, etc. Do you see entire workplaces getting the flu? Or your whole family getting it when you get it? Not likely. </p>
<p>Still ignoring death, COVID has much more serious lingering problems, regardless of health. 23 year old star NBA player Jason Tatum still has trouble breathing, UFC fighter Khamzat Chimiav almost retired in his prime because of how bad his covid got. You can easily search for the long-term health consequences, they can be rough and impact all ages.</p>
<p>When these outbreaks happen and all these young people go to their families, that’s where the more serious problems are. In 2019 35 million got the flu, 35 000 died. Covid has infected 5 million and killed over 180 000.... that is an extremely stark contrast. </p>
<p>Are you aware of the many many countries with completely full ICU’s with people close to death? In my country (Canada) there is a complete hospital crisis over COVID, leaving almost all other non-life threatening surgeries postponed, causing countless problems and deaths, unbelievable problems. </p>
<p>So in conclusion, young healthy people DO have many demonstrable long-term consequences from getting COVID, and with such a high death rate among those 40+ and the high infection rates it is absolutely irresponsible not to get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>The idea of painting people who are pro vaccine and govt regulation in the name of public safety as being in a cult is beyond absurd. This sub is way more cultish than you seem to think and I never see good faith arguments here. In another thread on this post someone rightfully pointed out the huge increase in total deaths from 2019 to 2020 and the response was just pure deflection.</p>

        <p>I don’t spend any time thinking about the vaccine or covid, I have 0 involvement with it in any form, and I don’t shitpost on reddit about how hard it is to wear a mask. If that means I’m in a cult then so be it - I must also be in a dog walking cult or a water drinking cult. This sub throws around the word cult like it has any relevance to the general population, which it absolutely doesn’t. Also, not that it really matters but I don’t think you know what apostasy means.</p>

        <p>Using the word "debate" to describe what the dumbfucks here do is too generous, though. The people you describe as "pro lockdown doomers" are people who worry for their friends and family and don't want them to die early because some mouthbreather is too self-righteous and ignorant to wear a mask or exhibit some selflessness and decency.</p>
<p>It's not a cult, it's called having a brain and wanting to live an enriching life without contracting a disease that will fuck up my lungs moreso than having chronic bronchitis and pneumonia already has. Fuck you, you piece of shit.</p>

        <p>Scientists use the scientific method? And we can’t be expected to never have faith in anyone else’s work when our entire society is built upon specialisation and accumulated knowledge from centuries of scientists. </p>
<p>You, an anti-vaxxer on Reddit are not a scientist, and you can’t deny the general consensus from actual scientists just because you’re afraid of needles. But hey, i guess it’s pretty hard understanding basic high school germ theory when your world view is built on, “no see thing = thing not real.”</p>
<p>Your background research is piling through Facebook posts, get your head out your ass and look at the insurmountable evidence over centuries of vaccine use that show their effectiveness. Understand the concept of herd immunity, not getting vaccinated is not a decision that affects you and only you, the reason why vaccines get rid of diseases is because the bulk of society gets vaccinated and builds immunity to the pathogen; affecting the transmission as well.</p>

        <p>Everyone outside of small children are vulnerable. Your age and health just determine how likely you will get sick, seriously sick, or die. </p>
<p>That said, everyone can spread it. And the US population (between those who are elderly and those who have conditions that would make them vulnerable) is overall very vulnerable. We thankfully have a decent hospital system with plenty of ventilators to handle the spikes we saw and keep deaths down. And we still saw over 500,000 die and counting. </p>
<p>Quickest way to herd immunity is mass vaccination longest way is just “waiting it out”... which may never come if the variants are allowed to continue to spread by “healthy people who don’t need a shot.” And then the variants will make the vaccines less effective, requiring new vaccines, and making people like you think “oh I guess the first vaccines were failures!” </p>
<p>If you don’t care for the of your community, that’s your prerogative. There’s no Good Samaritan law saying you need to get vaccinated yet. But if the virus continues to spread, mutate, and impact society (here and abroad), don’t be surprised when vaccinations become mandatory much like governments have done in the past.</p>

        <p>This is incorrect. Vaccines do not make someone 100% immune. Even getting sick from a virus doesn’t make you 100% immune afterwards. Just highly unlikely that you can sick if exposed. </p>
<p>And if enough people receive the vaccine, it makes it very very very hard for the virus to spread around because there is an over 90% chance that each person exposed will not get sick. And if a few do get sick, they won’t be able to spread it around rapidly. </p>
<p>If you flip the script and the virus spreads unchecked while only half the population (our elderly and vulnerable) are vaccinated, the vaccinated people will be exposed a lot... rolling the dice over and over again until they finally do get sick. </p>
<p>It’s like birth control or a condom. They are not 100% but very good at prevention. Especially for people not having tons and tons of sex. But if you had sex with (extreme hypothetical) everyone who came within 6 feet of you without a mask for 15 minutes... you would roll the dice enough times to beat the birth control or the condom.</p>

        <p>The faster it spreads, while the vulnerable are vaccinated, the faster there'll be herd immunity. Natural infection will cause a much broader immune response than that of a single protein response of the "vaccine" injections. Those that are vaccinated will be dependant on new vaccines with every significant variaton, while thos with a natural immune response will obviously have a naturally wider protection, not needing injections with synthetic RNA/DNA. Certainly younger people, for which a natural infection causes no harm, should absolutely avoid these vaccinations.</p>

        <p>The issue is, while this is definitely priority number one, the goal still remains to eradicate the virus. For this we need as many people vaccinated as possible  so we can achieve proper heard immunity.</p>
<p>There are some hurdles though, I am sure you've heard of the fact that the virus may be here to stay. If that is the case, then there is an additional reason to get people vaccinated and that is that not everyone can get vaccinated. The people usually can't get vaccinated overall do to some specific alergy, it is for them that people that could normally handle the virus need to get vaccinated as well. This has been done before for already eradicated or majorly reduced viruses. You don't hear of only old people having recieved vaccines for smallpox or measles, or seasonal viruses zuch as the flu while admittedly those effect young people much more except for the latter.</p>
<p>And here comes the transition for the final reason, and that is mutation. The more people get sick, the more the virus has a chance to mutate into something that can bypass the immune system of those that are vaccinated, compared to the past pandemics, there are a lot more people alive today. So it would be safer for everyone if the virus can spread as little as possible so if it can't be eradicated, that at least it will only mutate slowly. </p>
<p>I hope that shines light on some reasons on why it is a good idea to vaccinate everyone. There are some more, but these are the main three.</p>

        <p>&rt;...the goal still remains to eradicate the virus.</p>
<p>Eradication of this virus is impossible, as it jumps back and forth from humans to certain animals. Perhaps those must be vaccinated too?</p>
<p>&rt;...so we can achieve proper heard immunity.</p>
<p>Herd immunity cannot be achieved with mRNA/DNA-injections which only teach the immune system to respond to a single viral spike protein which is prone to mutate. Herd immunity against this virus and it variants is only possible through natural infection, which induces immune reactions to several proteins in this virus. Even variants will then trigger an immune response. If your immune system is trained to react only to one single viral protein, more injections will be needed with every significant mutations of that viral protein. Current vaccinations are making people permanently vaccine-dependant.</p>
<p>&rt;...additional reason to get people vaccinated and that is that not everyone can get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Yet people are politically and socially manipulated to get injected with experimental RNA/DNA which is granted exceptional use via EMA. This EMA voids if any aher viable treatment is available. So all viable treatment is prohibited (HCQ, Ivermectine, Budesonide,...). Nevertheless such treatment is what is needed for those that wouldn't be able to get vaxxed. As for now we're vaccinating healthy people, in order not to infect sick people  which we're denying treatment. That's real logic.</p>
<p>&rt;...majorly reduced viruses.</p>
<p>Still a leaky vaccine, which is causing possibly dangerous mutations and variations.</p>
<p>&rt;...And here comes the transition for the final reason, and that is mutation. The more people get sick, the more the virus has a chance to mutate into something that can bypass the immune system of those that are vaccinated,</p>
<p>It is in the vaccinated people that get infected (leaky vaccine) that the virus comes in contact with RNA/DNA-induced antibodies and mutates specifically to escape those antibodies. Vaccinated people are walking petri dishes that cause the variations. It's called viral immune escape.</p>
<p>&rt;I hope that shines light on some reasons on why it is a good idea to vaccinate everyone. There are some more, but these are the main three.</p>
<p>The vaccines are dangerous and should be stopped. There's need for a viable treatment and Ivermectin is momentarily the way to go, untill something better is found. Nevertheless, everyone is free to inject himself. But people like you should stop telling everyone what to do.</p>

        <p>Yes, we kill those animals, we've done so before with specific animal flues, what changes now? example is swine flu</p>
<p>And with bats and so on, there are plenty of bats with crazy viruses out there, ebola is another recent one, the reason is their special immune system, we should specifically not kill them as the consumption of bats is what causes these issues in the first place.</p>
<p>Your second point is refuted by my third one, more vaccinated people means less mutations. Also, Corona isn't Influenza, the spike proteins don't mutate as much in a beneficial way for the viruses due to their complexity, this is why humanity has never really had to deal with a corona virus to any significant extent when compared to for example influenza. If you have a counter claim to this, it is vital that I hear it. Natural herd immunity is also akin to darwinism, as in leaving the weak to succumb to the virus including healthy young people as there is always a chance to still get fatal symptoms, in addition natural herd immunity isn't always effective as well, as you said the virus mutates past one's immunity, now with corona as said this usually isn't an issue, but with billions of people getting sick it may be troublesome,  which is again why point three. The vaccine is an attempt to not follow Darwinism, to make a counter argument to this notion, you need to suggest a solution that has even less risk than a vaccine, which I am really interested in hearing about.</p>
<p>I am intrigued though about your claim of vaccine dependency,  can you elaborate further on a realistic notion on why this would be the case?</p>
<p>Where are we denying sick people treatment? You mean like how the US has a troublesome healthcare or what are you referring to?</p>
<p>The technology for these vaccines is new, that's correct, but how is injecting oneself with the function of membrane for a virus supposed to he worse than getting the full thing?  This is a crippling flaw in that reasoning. Can you elaborate on why the virus is better than basically using the for analogy sake "skin" of the virus for our immune systems to recognize the real deal? Especially with healthy people, that can easily handle it, essentially the reasoning can go both ways, so is it really a strong argument, if not then why?</p>
<p>To your reply with point 3, this isn't the case, the virus mutates in someone sick with it by chance, meaning the more cells infected the higher the chance for a mutation, the virus doesn't adapt by itself. So no, the argument you've made here relies on the notion of thought that the virus actively tries to circumvent the immune system in someone vaccinated which isn't the case, we both can agree that a virus doesn't hold intelligence. In addition much fewer cells get infected in someone with an immunized, immune system, so even if the virus could actively adapt it wouldn't get the chance. And lastly, your logic would also mean natural immunization wouldn't work.</p>
<p>The most dangerous vaccine is much less dangerous as in, in the odds of 1 in 10^4 less dangerous that getting the virus itself, so again, what is better about getting sick? </p>
<p>I will look into the suggestion of treatment in your last point.</p>
<p>Also, don't claim I am telling people what to do, especially if you're directly quoting my final statements in which I specifically say that I just shed lights on reasons on why people should get vaccinated, it's rude.</p>

        <p>&rt;Yes, we kill those animals</p>
<p>So you'll kill some animals, but not all. Will you test the animals before you kill them or are we talking about extinction?</p>
<p>&rt;...we should specifically not kill bats as the consumption of bats is what causes these issues in the first place.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses have been experimented on since 2004, so the origin of sars-cov2 remains inconclusive.</p>
<p>&rt;...more vaccinated people means less mutations.</p>
<p>More vaccinated people unjected with leaky vaccines mean more variations through immune escape.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, Corona isn't Influenza, the spike proteins don't mutate as much in a beneficial way for the viruses due to their complexity,</p>
<p>Yet we've had a UK variant, a SA variant, a Brazilian variant, an Indian variant,... and several other mutations, all within a year. And each time it wasn't clear, and for some still isn't clear if vaccinated immunity still is as efficient. That immunity being a immune rection to that single spike protein (putting all the eggs in one synthetic basket). Even Pfizers chief states that extra yearly shots will be necessary, whether it be for waining immunity as a booster, or a update of protein mutation to react to.</p>
<p>&rt; this is why humanity has never really had to deal with a corona virus to any significant extent when compared to for example influenza.</p>
<p>The origins of the virus is still unclear. If we would all start splicing bat viruses in our backyard, we'll see a certain raise in outbreaks of crazy batviruses. However this is not claim as even WHO can't prove the origiin of the virus.</p>
<p>&rt;Natural herd immunity is also akin to darwinism, as in leaving the weak to succumb to the virus including healthy young people as there is always a chance to still get fatal symptoms, in addition natural herd immunity isn't always effective as well, as you said the virus mutates past one's immunity,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt; now with corona as said this usually isn't an issue, but with billions of people getting sick it may be troublesome,  which is again why point three. The vaccine is an attempt to not follow Darwinism,</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>&rt; to make a counter argument to this notion, you need to suggest a solution that has even less risk than a vaccine, which I am really interested in hearing about.</p>
<p>It's not because there's not a straight solution now, that we just should buy into one radical solution, as in the vaccines: literally new technology in coronavirus vaccine, for the prevention of a disease we don't really know how it works, caused by a virus of which we do't eally know how it works.</p>
<p>Vaccination is one of multiple ways to go. But medical treatment is another. Yet the EUA of the novel vaccines demand there can't be any viable alternative treatment... So these are  prohibited. And that's a huge issue as it creates a lack of treatment for the sick and elderly that can't be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Au contraire, there 's political and social pressure in order to get everyone injected with mRNA/DNA. Even kids who don't even get sick from covid and once infected will naturally build a much broader immunity than they would from a halftested vaccine. The idea they need to get injected because they could infect others is only based on the fact that, again, all medicines for treatment of covid are prohibited. So no matter what you do, you're always forced to take the vaccine because all alternatives are forbidden. And even then, if you don't want the vaccine, you 'll be politically marginalized through privilege passports.</p>
<p>&rt;Where are we denying sick people treatment? You mean like how the US has a troublesome healthcare or what are you referring to?</p>
<p>HCQ, ivermectin, budesonide,.... Even vit D could be promoted. Sure it won't solve everything, yet nothing of all that. Powers that be rather test mRNA injections on 6 month olds.</p>
<p>&rt;The technology for these vaccines is new, that's correct, but how is injecting oneself with the function of membrane for a virus supposed to he worse than getting the full thing?  This is a crippling flaw in that reasoning. Can you elaborate on why the virus is better than basically using the for analogy sake "skin" of the virus for our immune systems to recognize the real deal?</p>
<p>Natural infection, for those that are not at risk, will provide broader immune response. Vaccines will only teach an immune response for a specific spike proteine. Next to that there 's the risk of ADE, which was still mentioned in the trials, but is now being downplayed since the rollout of the vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt; Especially with healthy people, that can easily handle it, essentially the reasoning can go both ways, so is it really a strong argument, if not then why?</p>
<p>There's no reason to inject healthy people that can handle the virus. They should get natural immunity instead of being dependant on injections.</p>
<p>&rt;To your reply with point 3, this isn't the case, the virus mutates in someone sick with it by chance,meaning the more cells infected the higher the chance for a mutation,</p>
<p>That's a slow paced genetic adaptation, mostly ending up in a more benign form because of higher viral efficiency.</p>
<p>&rt; the virus doesn't adapt by itself.</p>
<p>There is an adaptation through environmental factors. In this case the vaccine induced antibodies being the main driver.</p>
<p>&rt;we both can agree that a virus doesn't hold intelligence.</p>
<p>Lots of things in nature adapt to their environment without the need for intelligence. So no, I don't agree to that.</p>
<p>&rt;In addition much fewer cells get infected in someone with an immunized, immune system,</p>
<p>Agree.</p>
<p>&rt;so even if the virus could actively adapt it wouldn't get the chance.</p>
<p>If these novel vaccines were'nt leaky vaccines. But that isn't the case. Few studies already predicting that most covid victims during next fall will be elderly fully vaccinated people (not dying of age but from covid). But that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;And lastly, your logic would also mean natural immunization wouldn't work.</p>
<p>Natural immunity works for a while. Nobody knows how long it 'll last with covid. But I'm confident natural immunity is more robust than current vaccines, as vaccines are thought to be renewed yearly.  </p>
<p>&rt;The most dangerous vaccine is much less dangerous as in, in the odds of 1 in 104 less dangerous that getting the virus itself, so again, what is better about getting sick?</p>
<p>If someone is convinced about getting the vaccine, by all means they should do so.</p>
<p>&rt;I will look into the suggestion of treatment in your last point.</p>
<p>Maybe looking into the interviews with Dr Geert Vanden Bossche could be interesting. For sure he explains the viral immune escape much better than I cuold.</p>
<p>&rt;Also, don't claim I am telling people what to do, especially if you're directly quoting my final statements in which I specifically say that I just shed lights on reasons on why people should get vaccinated,</p>
<p>Ok. I miss out on a lot of nuances as English is not my language.</p>
<p>&rt;it's rude.</p>
<p>My bad. I don't mean to be rude.</p>

        <p>You are saying that 100% of people who are vulnerable are vaccinated right now or going to be eventually, so you don’t have to worry about the spread of the virus right now? It’s unrealistic to expect everyone who is vulnerable to be vaccinated instantly or as soon as you could be, everyone is dealing with different variables, including rampant misinformation. </p>
<p>Accounting for the large possibility of a vulnerable person still not being vaccinated (be it out of their control or not) is basic empathy, and gets us closer to living normal lives again.</p>

<p>Right, because a real scientist, such as yourself apparently, has reason to cite the Nuremberg Code.</p>
<p>Just curious where, in the United States, you are forced against your will to get a vaccine, whether that be held at gunpoint, or tied down? Because the first point of the Nuremberg Code stipulates that there's no crime against humanity if the subject is willing.</p>
<p>The real cult is you losers who only have insults by your side, clearly what this topic is about. There's no "science" being done here, just "don't trust the MSM, lel." (Which, I do see you guys enjoy citing Fox News here. They're Right wing MSM, are they not?)</p>

        <p>&rt; nearly impossible to have a normal life without the vaccine pasport?</p>
<p>Are you not aware that as of the 22nd, there <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/digital-transformation/vaccine-passports-10-states-with-bans-limitations-green-lights.html">were 14 states that banned the use of said passport</a>, and there are surely more to follow? Ironically, this very sub seems to be in support of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/n0pz2z/canadian_business_banning_vaccinatedmasked_people/">banning people who are vaccinated.</a> So it's alright to require people to tell you they're vaccinated and take away their "freedoms," but when someone tries the opposite, it's oppression?</p>
<p>&rt;Nuremberg trials had to do with other crimes too. Purposefully ignoring ivermectin and zinc chelating agents is blatent murder. You've got blood on your hands.</p>
<p>You're purposefully ignoring my question, and I wonder why. Is it maybe because unlike the Nazis and their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation">actual trials against Jewish people</a> there's no place in the US that's currently doing the same to get the COVID vaccine? Sure, there's advertisements, and "propaganda" to get it, but you're not being dragged from your workplace or home to be held down against your will and accept it. </p>
<p>&rt;You'd have no 'science' if it wasn't for the mass censorship and coercion. </p>
<p>Lol, ok. Censorship where? Debunking quack scientists and their "science" isn't censorship, it's exactly what science is, proving things right or wrong. Proving someone wrong isn't censorship.</p>
<p>&rt;Luckily the tide is turning, also at my <em>faculty</em>.</p>
<p>The word you're looking for, "doctor," is facility. Faculty are the people who work there. I do want to know where you work though, that way I can be sure to avoid it. Of course, I doubt you'll tell me.</p>

<p>And yes, censorship is everywhere. Go ask Pierre Capel for example. Exemplary scientist, immunologist, totally censored.   </p>

        <p>The vaccine isn’t just to prevent the healthy person from getting COVID, it’s also to prevent them from spreading it to others who are more vulnerable. Letting this virus continue to fester like it is also increases its chances of mutating into something more deadly. Please get vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Why would you need to know who is vaccinated? That’s personal shit. Being guilty until proven innocent is horseshit too and you know it.
There is such a small number of us that it wouldn’t matter if we lied or not. If anything, not wearing a mask and distancing would be a good incentive to get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Ok I see what you’re saying but I think it may be this way because if they told us we didn’t have to wear a mask once we got the vaccine anybody could say they are vaccinated and not wear a mask. It would be impossible to enforce a mask rule.</p>

        <p>I believe the masks are to limit the possibility of any new strains that may be resistant to vaccines to spread (which sometimes happens with the flu virus). And we don’t want a dangerous new variant spreading and killing like what has been happening in India.</p>

        <p>&rt;Letting this virus continue to fester like it is also increases its chances of mutating into something more deadly. Please get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Mass injecting with a leaky vaccine will result in vaccinated people still getting infected. Those people are walking petri dishes where the virus comes in contact with vaccine induced antibodies and will mutate and may generate dangerous variations. This is viral immune escape and has been well explained by vaccine specialist Geert Vanden Bossche.  Please don't get vaccinated because it forces the virus to mutate.</p>

        <p>This is the opposite of reality. The virus will mutate over time naturally. Mutations were already occurring prior to the vaccines. The cold and flu have mutated over time before vaccines existed. Many viral diseases have variants... some just mutate quicker than others.</p>

        <p>When vriuses mutate naturally, it is mostly into more benign variation. Viruses are not intended to kill their hosts, as they would evolve themselves out of existence. And some do indeed mutate faster than others in that way.</p>
<p>But that's not how immune escape works. The mass injecting of people with a leaky vaccine will have some of them infected while having antibodies, which is the cocktail for the creation of a variant which is resistant to those antibodies. It is pushing the virus to adapt to these antibodies or it'll perish.</p>
<p>So it are in fact vaccinated people which are the cause of these fast evolving variations, as the virus tries to adapt to the antibodies of these vaccinated people. The mutaions will mainly be on part of the spike protein on which all vaccinations are currently based.</p>
