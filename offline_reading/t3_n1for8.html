        <p>Also: </p>
<p>Q: "I do not require my employees to get the COVID-19 vaccine. However, I do recommend that they receive the vaccine and may provide it to them or make arrangements for them to receive it offsite. If an employee has an adverse reaction to the vaccine, am I required to record it? "</p>
<p>A: "No. Although adverse reactions to recommended COVID-19 vaccines may be recordable under 29 CFR 1904.4(a) if the reaction is: (1) work-related, (2) a new case, and (3) meets one or more of the general recording criteria in 29 CFR 1904.7, OSHA is exercising its enforcement discretion to only require the recording of adverse effects to required vaccines at this time. Therefore, you do not need to record adverse effects from COVID-19 vaccines that you recommend, but do not require.</p>
<p>Note that for this discretion to apply, the vaccine must be truly voluntary. For example, an employee’s choice to accept or reject the vaccine cannot affect their performance rating or professional advancement. An employee who chooses not to receive the vaccine cannot suffer any repercussions from this choice. If employees are not free to choose whether or not to receive the vaccine without fearing adverse action, then the vaccine is not merely 'recommended' and employers should consult the above FAQ regarding COVID-19 vaccines that are a condition of employment."</p>
<p>So if an employer says something along the lines of "Employees who wish to return to the office must get a vaccine, those who opt out may continue to work remotely but must give a reason. All employees are expected to return to the office by x date" - it appears that that is also considered required under these guidelines.</p>

        <p>Is this confusing anyone else or just me? So if it’s not employment related then who do you report your reaction to? I haven’t kept up with this so maybe you guys know the answer. I don’t know where it gets reported but pretty sure I know where your complaint gets filed. 🗑</p>

        <p>Unfortunately this won't hold up in court, IMO. This is not a legally viable "vaccine" as defined by statute. This is a "genetic therapy" as stated by the manufacturers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is exactly how the opposing counsel would destroy any legal standing.</p>
<p>Now, the real question is then can an employer force you to take a "therapy" to maintain employment? I would say no, but I'm not a lawyer. Under HIPAA, I'm certain that can't even ask those kind of questions of you.</p>
<p>We have to make sure of what we are arguing against. If we stop having the vaccine debate, because it isn't a vaccine, then we can advance the argument confidently as to why this is all unsafe and unproven. The biggest mistake we are making as a community of suspicious citizens is allowing the argument to be framed incorrectly from the beginning. We must force the opposition to argue for the promotion of a "genetic therapy" over other conventional therapies that have all proven effective across the world. Once we start comparing therapies during the crisis, we can make headway that the shot is a far more dangerous therapy than say hydroxychloroquine or Ivermectin, etc.</p>

        <p>Copy of another user's comment:
&rt;Federal Law currently prohibits employers from requiring vaccination with any of the Covid-19 vaccines because they are not actually FDA approved vaccines, and will still have at least two more years of official testing before actual official approval can be granted by the FDA after 2023 or so.</p>
<p>&rt;The covid-19 vaccines are only currently allowed to be used currently under emergency use authorizations. EG on the vaccine bottles they state: "This is an investigational vaccine not licensed for any indication. This product has not been approved or licensed by the FDA, but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA”</p>
<p>&rt;Under federal law, it is illegal for employers, including the US military, to mandate unapproved vaccines.</p>
<p>&rt;The same section of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that authorizes the FDA to grant emergency use authorization also requires the secretary of Health and Human Services to “ensure that individuals to whom the product is administered are informed … of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product.”</p>
<p>&rt;21 U.S. Code -- 360bbb–3 - Authorization for medical products for use in emergencies https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/360bbb-3</p>
<p>&rt;This has been mentioned and confirmed by officials from the CDC and US Health and Human services several times. If your employer tries to force you to take the vaccine and you do not want to, take them to court, and charge them with federal law violations.</p>
