    <strong>I don't feel like talking to people anymore I am so disgusted.</strong>
    <p><p>I participate in Zoom groups most of these groups are liberal, but one book club is mostly mainstream Republicans. Everyone lined up for the vaXX. </p>
<p>I have spoken out a little bit on my Facebook against vaccine passports but was ignored except by a few friends who aren't fooled--online friends. Everyone has bought into all this around me. </p>
<p>I am sick of Zoom and feel like all the activities on Zoom are useless and so tired of brain dead people I have to censor everything I say or when I do open my mouth they go silent. I think why bother anymore. Maybe I am depressed. What gets me is how some have adapted to the "new normal" and seem so happy with it and positive about life.</p>
<p>My feelings about people have grown worse. I don't have any real friends I can talk to about any of this stuff except 3 online friends who have been into conspiracy like me for years so they see things more independent then most people. Husband I convinced at least. I showed him endless links from here. </p>
<p>My social isolation which was bad to begin with is going to reach new heights. I am too high risk to go completely rejoin life although I did start going to some stores again, I live in one of the most locked down states.</p>
<p>I believe Covid is real, and understand others assessing their risks and making other decisions, but my life has been ruined. I don't even seeing this ever end. Life was hard enough being disabled with multiple health problems. The pressure to take a dangerous vaccine, has upset me with no understanding or empathy.</p>
<p>The disabled are being destroyed by all this shit you know, and no one cares. The eugenicists are out in full force. They don't give a damn about our high risk or that our gyms, or social groups were taken away from us. The fact that America is like everyone has to take these vaccines and does not take medical problems into account is disgusting me beyond belief. </p>
<p>There's single disabled people alone in apartments probably feeling like they are going to collapse, I at least have a loving husband.</p>
<p>No one cares about ADA either now, as everything is dedicated to COVID. The peer pressure is sickening, the sheep like obedience and not asking questions is sickening. The blind belief in experts is grossing me the hell out especially with some companies like J and J who harmed people and had legal cases over it.</p></p>

        <p>I am okay I have a husband to help me.  I have no real life local friends though, and well being this disabled in dystopia sucks. Also being pressured to take a dangerous vaccine when I have serious health problems is evil on multiple levels and is ableism times 1000. I will file a lawsuit under ADA if I am ever denied services, medicine, ability to buy food, or participate in society.</p>

        <p>It's just anecdotal but most of the patients I work with have the least problem with the J&amp; J vaccine. I don't know your diagnosis so I won't advise one way or the other. I will say follow your doctor's advice and not randoms internet people. I'm not sure what is hyperbole versus actual cause for concern with a vaccine passport at this point.</p>

        <p>I don't want any of them. Even J and J offers 60 percent protection, why bother with the risk when there's that other 40 percent.</p>
