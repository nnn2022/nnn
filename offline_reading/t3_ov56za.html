        <p>Yeah, Mr. Gottlieb (he lost the right to the other appellation with this nonsense) should have dropped from Pfizer's board if he wanted to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>I notice that almost ALL the doctors who are saying "These gene therapies are unsafe!" have no or extremely little stock in pharma companies while the ones who say "Go ahead and get the gene therapy, it is safe!" do have massive amounts of stock in pharma companies.</p>

        <p>Look I know everything deserves skepticism but I remember an old video of Gates describing population control through methods of medical coercion.... and I saw this years ago with a buddy before any of this Covid stuff. He was a highly skeptical person and believed some conspiracies I wouldn't personally hold a light to- but you just jogged my memory about it. I must have seen this over 5 years ago I feel.</p>
<p>I mean, I can hit YT for it but I'm not sure I'll find it.</p>
<p>Edit: Found it. Watch it until the end and listen carefully. This poster is delivering, suckas. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/C2Mdf_1LuZI">Bill Gates Population Control Quoted @ TEDX Talk</a></p>
<p>If I can find the full talk I'll post that too. But I remember hearing him say this shit clearly and a pit forming in my stomach thereafter. Just the thought of how many people place heavy trust in the sources he described.. utilizing vaccines, medicines- "to bring down ('population growth') by 10 to 15 percent." </p>
<p>Last 5 to 10 seconds of the video above. This was 7 to 8 years ago.</p>
<p>Here peeps, I came through twice. I didn't fully check- but I'm 90% sure this is the correct talk. It's actually pretty old. https://youtu.be/JaF-fq2Zn7I</p>
<p>The talk is initially about climate change and our impact via CO2 outputs (breathing is one of them people) but now- you see where this all ties up.</p>
<p>Also the clip is from near the 4:20 mark on the full vid. Should make it easy to remember and find.</p>

        <p>Me and everyone I know got vaccinated, and we’re totally fine. My grandmother got COVID at the beginning of the pandemic and died.</p>
<p>I legitimately do not understand the benefit of spreading distrust in the vaccine. Can you imagine if we decided not to trust the polio vaccine? Like this is just insanity. People are dying, but it’s not the vaccine that’s killing them.</p>

        <p>Alright, let’s take that one point at a time.</p>
<p>“people like you aren’t dying from covid with or without the vaccine”</p>
<p>I agree that I am far less likely to die from COVID than my grandma was. However, just because COVID won’t kill me doesn’t mean I can’t serve as a vector, allowing the virus to reach someone who it will kill. I’m not just getting vaccinated to protect myself - I’m getting vaccinated to protect everyone I know.</p>
<p>“grandmas are dying with and without vaccine”</p>
<p>This is wrong. Here’s a study showing otherwise: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7018e1.htm?s_cid=mm7018e1_w</p>
<p>“do you know the average age of covid death? it was 82.4 years just recently. it’s average.”</p>
<p>This makes sense - the elderly are of course at a much higher risk of death: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html</p>
<p>However, according to this source at least 15% of deaths are among those under 45 years old: https://datavisualizations.heritage.org/public-health/covid-19-deaths-by-age/</p>
<p>About 600,000 people have died of COVID in the US, so that’s 90,000 people under 45. Even if we decide that somehow old people don’t count and would’ve died anyways, the death of 90,000 people still easily constitutes a national tragedy.</p>
<p>“and there is a distrust in poli vaccines, there has been a massive wave of paralyzed people some time ago.”</p>
<p>I don’t even understand the point you’re trying to make here. Are you saying that people distrusted the vaccine for Polio and were paralyzed for life? Because that doesn’t seem to support your anti-vaccination position.</p>
<p>The reason I bring up Polio is because it is a disease that has been <em>100% eliminated</em> due to widespread vaccination. It shows the power of a vaccination campaign is saving human lives.</p>
<p>Anyways, I look forward to your fact-based and logical response here.</p>

        <p>&rt; This is wrong. Here’s a study showing otherwise</p>
<p>this is not wrong. this study is not showing otherwise, it's showing that vaccinated people have a reduced risk of severe symptoms, including death. </p>
<p>both it's always elderly and sick who are dying with covid, for both unvaccinated and vaccinated. and it's exactly the opposite for young and healthy people. </p>
<p>&rt; However, just because COVID won’t kill me doesn’t mean I can’t serve as a vector, allowing the virus to reach someone who it will kill. I’m not just getting vaccinated to protect myself - I’m getting vaccinated to protect everyone I know.</p>
<p>let me just quote the latest cdc announcement, mr virtue signaler</p>
<p><em>What’s more, in a statement accompanying the report, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky reported "similarly high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated people."</em></p>
<p><em>"High viral loads suggest an increased risk of transmission and raised concern that, unlike with other variants, vaccinated people infected with Delta can transmit the virus," Walensky said.</em></p>
<p>so you are killing those grandmas casually, aren't you </p>
<p>&rt; However, according to this source at least 15% of deaths are among those under 45 years old:</p>
<p>However it's irrelevant</p>
<p>&rt; Even if we decide that somehow old people don’t count</p>
<p>no, we don't do that</p>
<p>&rt; the death of 90,000 people still easily constitutes a national tragedy.</p>
<p>no, it constitutes virtue signaling </p>
<p>&rt; I don’t even understand the point you’re trying to make here. Are you saying that people distrusted the vaccine for Polio and were paralyzed for life? Because that doesn’t seem to support your anti-vaccination position.</p>
<p>1) research yourself. </p>
<p>2) I don't have a "anti-vaccination" position</p>
<p>&rt; The reason I bring up Polio is because it is a disease that has been 100% eliminated due to widespread vaccination. It shows the power of a vaccination campaign is saving human lives.</p>

        <p>Ok, so let’s focus on one thing here. You mention that vaccinated people don’t have a lower risk of transmission (although your quote directly contradicts that - note that it says for non-Delta variants, vaccinated people cannot transmit the virus). This seems to indicate that you think risk of transmission is a problem. Do you wear a mask in public? My guess would be that you don’t.</p>
<p>My point here is that you seem to be consigning the elderly and sick to an early but avoidable death because you’re not willing to take the merest of precautions. Why do you do this? Seriously, think about it. Wearing a mask isn’t that hard, I spent all of the pandemic going for runs with a mask on. Getting vaccinated is even simpler. What is your reasoning here? Why do you value the smallest of individual freedoms above the lives of others? Seriously, defend yourself. I just don’t see how your position is morally tenable.</p>

<p>no, my quote doesn't contradict it. no, she doesn't say that</p>

<p>no, I don't think that risk of transmission is a problem, it's only a problem for your virtue signaling </p>

<p>relevance? </p>
<p>&rt; My point here is that you seem to be consigning the elderly and sick to an early but avoidable death because you’re not willing to take the merest of precautions.</p>
<p>how am I relevant to deaths of others? I'm healthy and not killing people. </p>
<p>&rt; Why do you do this? </p>
<p>I don't do anything</p>
<p>&rt; Wearing a mask isn’t that hard, I spent all of the pandemic going for runs with a mask on. </p>
<p>wearing a mask is also useless, but I don't mind you wearing as many as you want</p>
<p>&rt; Why do you value the smallest of individual freedoms above the lives of others?</p>
<p>because I can.</p>
<p>also because it's not your responsibility to ensure my safety, I'm not delegating to you my safety, I'm not relying on you for security, I'm not letting you to protect me even if you want, I'm not letting you to even speak on my behalf. so I have no obligations in front of you to return the favor </p>
<p>&rt;  I just don’t see how your position is morally tenable.</p>
<p>not killing people and minding my own business is morally great. and I don't need to justify myself to strangers, so it's double great</p>

        <p>I think your mindset is interesting - basically that no one owes you anything, and you don’t owe anyone else anything. This is pretty easy to argue, but is it really the world you want to live in? I like the idea of living in a society where we all care for each other’s wellbeing, doing acts of kindness even if we aren’t strictly obligated to. </p>
<p>I like the idea of working together with my fellow humans to build something greater than I ever could individually. And maybe that’s ultimately where we differ. To you, personal freedom is paramount. For me, I believe most strongly in living a life of kindness, even if it doesn’t optimally preserve my freedoms.</p>
<p>I don’t think you’re a bad person, I don’t imagine you think I am either. Both of our life experiences led us to our opinions. I ultimately believe that your choices are hurting society, but of course you’re not acting maliciously. I wish you all the best, and hope you can find whatever it is you’re looking for.</p>

        <p>I guess I just feel like losing some rights is part of the societal contract. Like we’re all forced to pay taxes, and in return we get access to roads, schools, etc. In the pandemic, we were forced to follow the advice of medical professionals, and in return we were able to hopefully save some American lives.</p>
<p>To me, being asked to wear masks and get vaccinated (even though being vaccinated hasn’t even been mandated by law) doesn’t seem like that much of a stretch beyond what’s normally asked of us as members of a society. I mean hell, I was required to get vaccinated (against other diseases, of course) to attend college, and that was before the pandemic was even vaguely on the horizon.</p>

        <p>No no no, this is the whole point. <em>I</em> give a shit about what you believe. That’s why I’m having this conversation with you.</p>
<p>Ok, so basically your perspective is that you would never step back on your liberties. Understandable. If the US went to war, I’m guessing you’d also oppose a draft?</p>

        <p>Ok now I’m genuinely confused. You just want me to mind my own business? Why have we been having this conversation? You could have just never responded to me.</p>
<p>I think the fact that you have no interest in understanding “the other side” says a lot about your character. You’re not interested in fostering unity. You just want to be right and for everyone who disagrees to shut up and go away. It sounds like you’re probably angry a lot. I’d guess that you’re also probably pretty unhappy - you probably think the world is unfair and people are assholes and that you’re the victim in the grand storyline of our world.</p>
<p>I seriously urge you to consider this about yourself. Self-reflect a little bit. Think about why you’re so angry and how it affects you. Maybe the people who love you have had a harder time being around you. Maybe you’ve lost friends over the years. And maybe you just feel really alone. I’m truly sorry for you.</p>

<p>is this you minding your own business? </p>
<p>&rt; I think the fact that you have no interest in understanding “the other side” says a lot about your character. </p>
<p>no, it doesn't </p>
<p>&rt; You’re not interested in fostering unity.</p>
<p>I don't see fear mongering msm, governments and their followers fostering any unity. why would I want any unity? </p>
<p>&rt; You just want to be right and for everyone who disagrees to shut up and go away</p>
<p>no, I don't want to be right. being right means this theater will never end, injections will become mandatory and annual, you will need to show papers to buy a bread. </p>
<p>everyone who wants me to release my liberties does need to shut up and go away, yes, this is correct </p>
<p>&rt; It sounds like you’re probably angry a lot</p>
<p>I'm rarely angry, only inhuman stupidity triggers me at some point. but I don't harass my friends and family with covid talks at all, it's just not a part of our lives together </p>
<p>&rt; I’d guess that you’re also probably pretty unhappy </p>
<p>no, you guessed wrong again </p>
<p>&rt; you probably think the world is unfair and people are assholes and that you’re the victim in the grand storyline of our world.</p>
<p>no, I don't think that world is unfair, I have a great and successful life myself</p>
<p>&rt; I seriously urge you to consider this about yourself. Self-reflect a little bit. Think about why you’re so angry and how it affects you. </p>
<p>thanks a lot, it helped so much. </p>
<p>&rt; Maybe the people who love you have had a harder time being around you.</p>
<p>evidently not</p>
<p>&rt; Maybe you’ve lost friends over the years</p>
<p>evidently not </p>
<p>&rt; And maybe you just feel really alone. </p>
<p>evidently not</p>
<p>&rt; I’m truly sorry for you.</p>

        <p>Goodness my friend, this isn’t a court of law. I’m recommending that you share your opinions with those who disagree with you so that you can either a) solidify what you believe or b) get exposed to new ways of thinking. It’s a win-win either way, as long as you’re willing to listen.</p>
