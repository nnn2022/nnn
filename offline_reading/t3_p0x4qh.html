    <strong>In the UK at least: societal lockdown saves lives, building hospitals is too expensive</strong>
    <p><p>A sensible person would see reality is reversed, especially when comparing the national debt (passed onto the future generation) to the cost of a hospital (which could've been passed onto the future generation)</p></p>

        <p>100% this. Lockdown to compensate for years of NHS under-funding and lack of contingency capacity planning. Why the ***k should we put up with losing our human rights and civil liberties because of Tory austerity and incompetence ?</p>

        <p>Not just Tory incompetence, governmental decline in general! Labour is almost a meme at this point calling each other comrade like they’re  some Russian daytime television bad guy, Bozo Johnson and his crony fuckwits playing their usual austerity measures that everyone always sees coming but then acts surprised when it happens and the Lib Dem’s aren’t even worth mentioning, they’re outright psychopaths!</p>
<p>We need massive reform in government and a complete revision of government spending and salaries, these fuckers fleece the people in tax and provide nothing of use to the country in general!</p>

        <p>Yeah, its very broken. Pretty much the only thing Starmer has done right is make a few bleats against vaccine passports and it remains to be seen if those bleats translate into actions rather than just hot air. The best start on fixing this shit would be proportional representation and limiting the agenda-setting powers of the MSM, but I am not holding my breath :-(</p>

        <p>Yeah I did see Starmer poking his head out and throwing some shade at the freedom passes, I’d hoped he was going to start being more vocal after that, then again he literally wasted nearly £1000 of tax payer money on “Office Supplies” and nearly 3 times that on “other expenses” which he and his constituents refused to elaborate on. I have no hope for any of the main parties at this point.</p>
<p>I think if we could implement it there should be a huge consequence for the lies and dishonesty of the government and media, I mean major consequences too. Not just fines that they can pay away and then carry on spouting/printing the crap they usually churn out... I’m talking solid visible actions that will actively hurt their status, such as against the urinalists who deliberately wrote the lies and misinformation and the editors who approve it, the politicians who lie to us daily and fail to implement any policy or laws that help the people. These are the people in the positions of the most responsibility... thus they should be held to the highest standards of the law and morality, not that this will happen but a guy can dream eh?</p>
<p>Sorry for the essay, just needed to get it out my system.</p>

        <p>I agree with everything you said except the party about the NHS being underfunded, what exactly is underfunding in the contact of the NHS? How much more of the national budget does the system need to take for it's managers to be satisfied, it's a simple reality that the NHS was designed at a time when people did not live as long, as people love longer they have more chronic diseases which are more expensive to manage, the NHS can not cope because it lacks a market mechanism and the British medical council are a cartel limiting the supply of doctors. There's so much wrong with the system that it's almost unfixable.</p>

        <p>And at no point in last 18 months has anything been mentioned about upscaling NHS capacity, despite spending £32bn on track and trace, and over £500m on covid-19 'propaganda'.</p>
