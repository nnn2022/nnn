    <strong>"We're making progress" No we're not.</strong>
    <p><p>The damage has been done. I see "mask mandates lifting, we're making progress". "This lawmaker says masks are unconstitutional". "A normie is waking up". "Fauci is being exposed, the truth of the virus is being revealed"</p>
<p>So what.</p>
<p>The damage has been done. Too little too late. They've done what they wanted to do, destroy the worlds economy, cause as much suffering to people as they can, divide and conquer, get most people to take this poison jab. The world is moving in a new direction now and it's exactly what they wanted. And now we're being thrown a bone to "make up" for everything.</p>
<p>The authorities and media can say all they want what the truth is, how it was all taken out of hand... as someone on this reddit forum said, "la-de-frickin-da".</p>
<p>The damage is already done. They won.</p>
<p>Edit: This doesn't mean I've given up. Far from it. But let's also be realistic. </p></p>

        <p>Fighting to prevent mandatory vaccines, covid passports and future lockdowns is worthwhile and winning those battles is a victory. There is no denying they did a lot of damage and stole a massive amount of wealth but people are right to be happy if the worst is prevented and we can live our lives again.</p>

<p>At this rate, we're likely not going to win those battles. Because the media and politicians will just use the same tactics they did this time, scare everyone, and enact the passports, lockdowns, etc. All they have to say is that the virus is "mutating", and every Harry, Joe, and Sally will piss themselves, and immediately do whatever the Talking Heads tell them to. I don't see this changing, and believing that it is, is ignorant and naive.</p>

        <p>This too shall pass. Whether people finally notice there is nothing to be afraid of, the vax turns out to be the real threat, or economies break down to the point the lockdowns cannot be financially sustained, it will end. Or possibly China moves to the kinetic phase while all its enemies are busy hollowing themselves. Whatever comes, the current set up is not a sustainable one, and so at some point a catalyst will cause it to collapse.</p>

        <p>I’d say you have the right idea. My only added thing is what we can do is keep providing the facts so more people wake up sooner. </p>
<p>My specific expectation is most likely when the next winter hits for the heavily vaxxed places, UK, France, Italy, Germany, the blue US states, it all starts to unravel. People had the panic in them deep but the fear alone would’ve worn off if there wasn’t an out they were waiting for. The vax was their saviour and when it fails this is all over IMO. The fact red US states are already open, have low vax rates, etc really helps as further counter examples when they fair the same or better. It’ll be right there when people finally hit that point of disillusionment. That is were the info we put out is so useful. The MSM is going to keep the propaganda pump going until suddenly doing a 180 when change is already inevitable (and then take credit).</p>
<p>The elites are constantly worried about shifts in sentiment and what they can get away with. I don’t know about the US but this was so obvious in AU and UK with constant ‘leaks’ of plans to determine what could skate through and what would be unacceptable. I expect for this coming winter cases go up, the usual suspects try to reimpose lockdowns but this time it just doesn’t take, and then the governments just sort of start lifting the restrictions no one is following anyway.</p>

        <p>I have to say I do share your view more than I’d like to admit. Despite the continual resistance, it’s only human to feel desperate and we all are in our own way.

However absolutely I can’t deny that we’re gonna be dealing with these irreversible consequences in the coming months and this is far from over.</p>
<p>The top 1% have stolen an overwhelming amount of our economy and transacted it into their bank vaults. More than a quarter of America’s bank notes were printed in 2020 alone. Now the same people are preparing us for UBI after furlough made us so docile. </p>
<p>The never ending reports of food chain and infrastructure attacks. Maliciously intended sabotage for the next boogeyman cyber pandemic to present itself as an existential threat. </p>

<p>David Icke in his second interview, regarding the people running the scamdemic, with Brian Rose from London Real said, "<strong><em>if you think what they're now is bad? What? They haven't even gotten started yet!</em></strong>" I agree with his assessment and yours that this is just part of the plan.</p>

<p>This is unfortunately true, and no one seems to be connecting the dots. Referring back to David Icke in his second interview with Brian Rose, he said it bluntly, they'll roll back some of the mandates, and it will look like "we won" but they will keep some of it there to remind us that they can reimpose the lock downs again at any time for any given reason under the guise of an "emergency." A perfect example of this is Australia and New Zealand. Those two Western countries are the test beds for what is coming our way if we don't get off our asses and do something.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah that David Icke/London Real interview was so eye opening because everything’s transpired exactly as he stated. I don’t put my trust or faith in any individual nowadays in the unfortunate case that they’re controlled opposition and just playing a part, but as a point of reference people like David Icke are the equivalent of encyclopedic accuracy as to every facet of what’s going on.</p>
<p>The influx of comments I’ve been seeing where many are viewing the vaccination stats and saying “come on everyone we’re almost there, we’ll be back to normal by autumn at this rate!”, saddens me more than it should. I wish I could go back to the days before March 2020 and I didn’t use my critical thought, I feel like I’m going down with the ship the way everyone around me is insistent this is the only way forward. When there’s a majority opinion, it’s rare for us to come away unscathed. I’m accepting everything as is but I feel like I’m losing the will in how alone I feel.</p>

<p>Isn't it weird, once we go down that rabbit hole we can't unravel what we have found?</p>
<p>&rt;I wish I could go back to the days before March 2020 and I didn’t use my critical thought</p>
<p>I don't know, do we really want to live in ignorance? I think if we lived like that, we can be easily controlled and manipulated. I almost fell into this trap had it not been for David Icke, dancing nurses and people asking simple questions.</p>
<p>&rt;I feel like I’m going down with the ship the way everyone around me is insistent this is the only way forward.</p>
<p>You shouldn't feel alone, I think when most of us discovered that something was not right, and when became aware of it, the fact that no one sees what we see, yes, it is natural to think that way. My first thought was, how can people be this blind and why aren't any one doing anything? </p>
<p>And then again, it hit me like a brick, I think it was like May or June as I reading up on history, remember Germany? When the German people discovered what Hitler was up to, but the majority of them thought, it is better to go along to get along; don't want to make the NAZIS mad, otherwise it is you're considered part of the problem, and who wants brown shirts at their door steps picketing. I think that is what most people are doing.</p>

        <p>&rt; I wish your post had more upvotes because this is a healthy dose of reality that many aren’t willing to accept. I’m trying so damn hard to remain optimistic but trying to juggle that with facing the facts becomes increasingly difficult the more they don’t let up.</p>
<p>Stop being optimistic. Seriously, people keep yammering on about optimism, kindness, hope, etc. All these buzzwords that the media throws around that idiots cling to (yes, I am also talking about our side here), and use it as an excuse to sit around, and pray for things to get better instead of taking action.</p>
