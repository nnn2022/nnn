        <p>No vacation yet but so many times on my days off I want to do something social which for me would be going like downtown where it's dominated by millennial liberal masker types so I end up just not going out.</p>

        <p>I'm right there with you.  I cannot bring myself to actually pay to be in a situation where I need to wear a mask.  If find DisneyWorld fascinating.  They are in Florida so they do not have to enforce mask wearing but they do as people walk around in the hot sun wearing their useless Clown Masks.  Which always begs the question if you have actually read the documentation proving that they are useless why would you PAY to walk around even outside wearing one....or.....if you are deathly afraid of dying of covid then why would you go to a crowded place like Disney where "social distancing" is impossible.  It seems like those who embrace the covidian principles BEND them when it suits their personal desires.</p>

        <p>Not a chancee. I love travelling, especially world travel. But I refuse to go anywhere that enforces mask-wearing, social distancing, curfews, and all the other restrictions. It hugely takes the fun out of travelling - which is all about exploration and freedom.</p>
<p>So I'll happily save my money and time, and travel domestically here in the States, to places that are back to normal, probably until next fall. Get all 50 states done. By then, I figure all this shit should be over and done with in most places - allowing me the freedom and flexibility to easily travel to several countries without having to worry about all the bullshit virus-related restrictions.</p>

<p>Quick story from a Red State and continued virtue signaling.  In my area there is a very popular bar right on the water.  There are several bars completely outside with a covering for the workers and those sitting at the bar.  The rest of the layout is tables right on the sand and completely out in the open.  The bathrooms are the type where even the entrance doors are always open.  I went there a year ago when they first started the mask lunacy.  On entrance I was told you need to wear a mask.  I said that the current county policy is you only need to wear a mask when inside and not sitting down at the bar or a table.  And I went onto say everything is OUTSIDE HERE even the bathrooms are barely inside.  I haven't been back since.  So let them commit financial suicide with their virtue signalling bullshit.</p>

        <p>Absolutely will not. I enjoy just traveling to nice cities, just walking around looking, shopping, and eating. I won't be doing that with mask rules. I spent a couple hundred to go to a water park that opened back up. It was like traveling back to 2019. Only one idiot in a mask and the place was packed.</p>

        <p>Me last vacation was in july last year, back when most stuff was still remotely normal here (talking about restaurants open, public baths open, shopping centres open, museums open....). It was pretty enjoyable tbh, the only thing that made it different to a pre covid vacation was having to wear a mask indoor when shopping or so. </p>
<p>That being said, I will not go on any vacation this year. Now everything is locked down, only grocery stores are open. One cant even go out freely in most places anymore. I think I cant even book a hotel in most regions here for private reasons. So nah, I stay at home or drive into the forest or mountains for some days with my tent.</p>
