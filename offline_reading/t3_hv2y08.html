        <p>I've never seen such an intense and coordinated media campaign for something in my life. I think that's one reason. It is a hilariously inconsistent campaign though, going from one thing to the next where I am - from deaths to cases to  R0 and now most recently "recovery rate". Actually I say hilarious because it sounds like such nonsense but I'm actually disturbed by it all.</p>

        <p>It was once I started doing research into who controls the media and who stands to gain that it all became clear. This is a very deliberate strategy, it may look uncoordinated, but it is in fact highly focused.</p>

        <p>Yes. I know people here continue to say this is all coincidence and the media and government are just dumb fuck-ups, but this all seems way too coordinated and focused to be a regular "fuck-up". Yes, many people do stand to gain money and control of the population through keeping them afraid.</p>

        <p>Wow.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Coercion</strong></p>
<p>&rt;7. Compulsion: Experience with UK enforcement legislation such as compulsory seat belt use suggests that, with adequate preparation, rapid change can be achieved (16). Some other countries have introduced mandatory self-isolation on a wide scale without evidence of major public unrest and a large majority of the UK’s population appear to be supportive of more coercive measures. For example, 64% adults in Great Britain said they would support putting London under a ‘lock down’ (17). However, data from Italy and South Korea suggest that for aggressive protective measures to be effective, special attention should
be devoted to those population groups that are more at risk (18). In addition, communities need to be engaged to minimise risk of negative effects. Consideration should be given to enacting legislation, with community involvement, to compel key social distancing measures.</p>
<p>&rt;8. Social disapproval: Social disapproval from one’s community can play an important role in preventing
anti-social behaviour or discouraging failure to enact pro-social behaviour (15). However, this needs to
be carefully managed to avoid victimisation, scapegoating and misdirected criticism. It needs to be
accompanied by clear messaging and promotion of strong collective identity. Consideration should be
given to use of social disapproval but with a strong caveat around unwanted negative consequences.</p>
<p>I also love the last two rows of Appendix B: the only ways to have a "positive" score in the Equity column is to provide free shit.</p>

        <p>The huge push for masks in the past week or two has to be coordinated.  At the same time Wal-Mart, Target and just about every other major retailer mandated masks, I'm seeing celebrities and social media stars posts all over about "Doing your part.  Wear your mask."  It is everywhere on Reddit now.  Stores have started selling "designer" masks.</p>
<p>All of the electronic billboards in my town now have "Wear your mask" signs and I'm seeing it on traffic signs as well.  The timing has to be intentional.</p>

        <p>If there were no social media, we would have moved on already. But people can use their page to mask shame and complain that others aren’t as caring and loving as they are. They can also show off their perfect lives they continue to live while staying home. (I knew someone who made almost 90 days straight of posts with photos and a description of her and her family’s day.) The doomers can also use Facebook and Twitter comments to lambast governors and businesses who don’t “do the right thing” and get policies catered to them. </p>
<p>As long as the doomers are using social media to get themselves worked up about “rising cases” and playing the moral police, this will unfortunately continue until the media gets bored.</p>
<p>We need people to go back to work and kids in school and maybe then, enough of the public will divert their attention from this. Too many have been sitting at home for four months whining about how unsafe it is to leave their house.</p>

        <p>Absolutely agreed.  It is tearing our country apart and further divides people.  Reasonable discussion is gone.</p>
<p>I wonder if someday our society will look back at social media usage the way we view smoking today.  It was acceptable at the time and everyone did it, but today we know the negative effects and it is no longer considered kosher in society.</p>
<p>Or it will just become worse and more widespread and we will all become social media slaves.</p>

        <p>It does tell me something and it should tell everyone with a brain the same thing.   Up through the end of may the vast majority of cases were in NY, NJ, MA, and CT on the east coast and CA and WA on the west.  They went into strict lockdowns and 4-6 weeks later we saw the benefits and new cases started coming down nation wide.  Because the areas reporting 80+% of the cases were controlling it with mitigation measures.  </p>
<p>Many states "opened" in May, or never did much to lock down at all, while they still only had low 1000s of cases undetected in their communities, and not 10's of thousands yet.  Now they have tens of thousands confirmed and hundreds of thousands more not yet tested.  </p>
<p>It's no wonder it's back in the media now, because now we have NYC in April levels of spread in a dozen different parts of the country.   </p>
<p>Bodies in refrigerated trucks in 5 of America's biggest cities is going to be a story on the news.  I'm shocked there are people who cant figure this out.</p>

        <p>Try the news tab.  Its incredible that you can somehow deny or avoid the fact that there are over run hospitals and morgues putting bodies into trucks... Its literally all over the news.  Without the general public changing behaviors, in two weeks it will be worse.   This is a deadly virus spreading.  Wake the fuck up.</p>

        <p>But how come NY and other places are now complaining about spikes in cases? Because it’s inevitable when you open up. It’s been the case in other countries as well. You can’t lockdown until coronavirus is magically solved, it was never feasible. That’s why all the measures were to “flatten the curve” not eliminate the virus. Even Fauci admitted from day one they expected “a lot of people to get this”, but the goal was to not get it all at once.</p>

        <p>When you look at how much economic damage was caused by lockdowns maybe you’ll change your tune. MUCH more damage will be done due to humanity pretending it cared, then by actually taking proper precaution and doing what was right. </p>
<p>You will see just how many businesses fail, families lose their homes, people kill themselves, lose every ounce of themselves.</p>

        <p>The "economic catastrophe" is a boogie man that right wing news spooks people with.  The stock market isnt the economy.   70% of people dont own stocks.  99% of people dont own a business, small or large.   Those 70% are going to suffer more (and many will literally die) to protect the profits of the remaining 30%.   And even among that 30% group, most of them arent so rich that they care about their 401k more than they care about putting their own health and their families health in jeopardy over. </p>
<p>If there was a coordinated government response, or pre-existing adequate social safety net that kept unemployed people from losing their homes and their health insurance if they stay out of work for a few months because of the pandemic, the economic impacts would hardly be felt by the vast majority of Americans.</p>
<p>We are the richest country in the world.  To save a million lives we can afford to have 90% of people stay home for 2 months while the government picks up the bill.</p>

        <p>I knew it was futile, but when I saw someone post on another sub that mask sceptics are all 'stupid motherfuckers' I politely pointed out that there isn't really any scientific evidence in favour of masks in the community. The outpouring of hate and stupidity was breathtaking. It's become a new religion for a lot of people. It's hard not to despair.</p>

        <p>This seems to be by design. The Powers That Be want masks to be the new normal, likely tied in to whatever agenda they are trying to push. They are riling up people to radicalize them more. Notice all the new articles recently, encouraging people to yell at and even attack anti-maskers, in the name of "health and safety"? Yeah, they are trying to stir people up, and frighten them. "If you don't wear masks, you and your loved ones <strong>will</strong> get sick, suffer, and die." This is what the government and media continues to repeat.</p>

        <p>I am not an epidemiologist so I cant explain it.  I defer to what the experts reccomend, and apply a little common sense.  If everyone wears a mask outside it costs us absolutely nothing.  </p>

<p>Social distancing and masks.  It's so glaringly obvious that they help.  And yet there are somehow subs like this full of conspiracy theorists that think common sense public health policies are a deep state 5G microchip new world order.</p>

        <p>It hit Europe earlier and spread faster,  there is no controlling the virus.  The US is roughly the same size as Europe with less than half as many people.  Most of the US locked down hard early on,  before it spread much.  Now it's our turn and we actually have testing,  that Europe didn't have early on. It's really not that complicated</p>

        <p>So you're saying the reason cases have been declining in Europe is that it already spread through the continent and infected everyone?  The lock downs and masks and social behavior have no impact on how the virus spreads?</p>

        <p>They had 1500+ confirmed cases.  And now they have zero.  They didn't stop the spread by closing their borders and letting it burn through 30% of their population.  So even if that 15-30% claim was accurate (which it's not AFAIK, it takes more like 70% to reach herd immunity) your point is invalid.</p>

        <p>The science is far from settled. Many studies have found no reduction in transmission and there are risks posed by inexpert mask wearing - both to the wearer and people around them.</p>
<p>As to why - that is a good question. My personal opinion is that governments have over-reacted to the risk posed by the virus. While this was understandable in the early weeks of the pandemic, subsequently data has emerged that much of what was done was ineffectual and unnecessary. The last thing any government, or media organisation wants is to have to say, "Whoops. Sorry guys, we just destroyed the economy and our health services for nothing", so they have to keep doubling-down by keeping people terrified and compliant.</p>
<p>They are also given a huge amount of support by pharmaceutical companies, who are really, really keen to sell us vaccines. The amount of money flowing their way is huge, so they have every reason to keep the fear going, despite the evidence that the virus is not a particular threat at the moment. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but you do have to wonder why there has been such a concerted effort to discredit cheap and safe HCQ, for example, to the point where the Lancet has to withdraw a paper for using made-up data.</p>

        <p>People are sick of it. They are just scared to speak up because they will lose friends and have people bully them/call them selfish and bring up dead grandmas. I posed on Facebook about how sick I am of the lockdowns and how the people who are most pro-lockdowns are also the biggest hypocrites and I immediately lost 12 Facebook friends and had multiple people responding that I am selfish and to think of the grandmas and the children with cancer (??). </p>
<p>You are not alone in being sick of it. Unfortunately, the people who are not sick of it are in a panic due to all of the rising "cases." And they are more than happy to "stay home" because they have cushy work from home jobs or are receiving unemployment. They also still break the "rules" more than you think; they just virtue signal online about how everyone's health matters and masks are awesome so they can feel good about themselves. The same people who bitch about how everything needs to remain locked down still go on vacations and see friends and extended family. Take away their Netflix, groceries, takeout, Target, Starbucks and their beach house to escape to and we will see how quick they grow sick of it.</p>

        <p>Oh, no, the attention spans were indeed diverted for two weeks in June. But the unrest coincided with reopening, so when positive tests started increasing (as expected!) we shoved BLM to the side and put COVID back front-and-center.</p>
<p>I'm sad that it might take people protesting lockdowns, mask mandates, and business restrictions for any of this to actually change.</p>

        <p>No joke! It's really shown how selfish some people are.</p>
<p>People who can work from home or get the big payout from unemployment couldn't care less about the people losing their jobs or can't get unemployment. Anytime I try to sell people on reopening for the sake of people who have lost everything, they just shrug and say it's just not safe. It's easy for them to say that when they're financially fine. It really disgusts me how callous they are.</p>

<p>The vaccine is not a good thing, and is probably a part of the reason they are pushing masks and lockdowns still (as manipulation to pressure people into getting the vaccine so we can "go back to normal", and even then, I have my doubts they will revert things back to how they were anyway).</p>

        <p>I think the vaccine is a good thing it will appease lots of doomers plus they can be the lab rats on the most rushed vaccine in the world.  They are going to strongly suggest people get vaccinated but there's no way they can force people to take it. That would be a violation of various human and civil rights.</p>

        <p>Being realistic, there isn't an end to this. This is a slippery slope we are falling down. It's the entire reason the media is pushing "the new normal" narrative. It is conditioning people to accept life this way. The government doesn't care about violating human rights, or the Constitution, or anything, if that hasn't been made clear enough already. They may not be going door to door with a needle forcing you to be vaccinated, but just wait until stores start requiring "covid passports" as proof of vaccination before you can enter a shop or anything. "That's their right as a business" will be the excuse. "No shirt, no shoes, no vaccine, no service" will be the new mantra, replacing the push for masks. "Just take the vaccine so we can all go back to normal," they'll tell you. The technology is already there. Phone apps are already there. Contact tracing is already ramping up. This isn't disappearing, this is part of the new reality they have constructed artificially through fear and propaganda. There would not be such a massive, global coordinated push for this if everything was going back to normal. There has been way too much thought and effort put into all of this.</p>

        <p>I do, I'll never be a part of their new normal. But time will tell how things will actually play out. I just don't think going back will be an option. They are trying to demoralize people into compliance. "Behave and wear a mask and social distance otherwise you'll get another lockdown!" "Better wear a mask and listen to us because you're killing people, look at the cases rising!"</p>
<p>They want people to say fuck it, and listen to them in hope that if they do things will be normal again. And then they dangle normality like a carrot on a string to make people hate those who don't comply with the illusion that it's <em>their fault</em> things aren't normal and that people are sick. Snitch phone lines etc. So they do this "phase" approach where people feel like things are going back, and then WAIT, people aren't complying?! Lock it back down! Second wave! Third wave! Every fall! Airborne AIDS! Only Bill Gates and Fauci can save us!</p>
<p>After enough time I'm afraid people are going to be accustomed to this. The new normal will <em>actually</em> become the new normal.</p>
