    <strong>If COVID was such a threat, why did some schools take weeks to close?</strong>
    <p><p>I got a long suspension on my normal account because I dared to criticize China. I had this thought and thought it was so important I made another account. I feel like this is somewhat important.</p>
<p>A while back I had a discussion with my older brother who lives in Washington state. He was saying that the decision to close schools took a long time. It took around two weeks before they finally shut them down. At least in the district his kids are in, it took a long time. This was in March so I don’t blame them for being careful. I admit I didn’t know much about COVID at that point. I understand that they needed to discuss it and come up with a plan but if this virus is so deadly, it could have been done in two days. Instead they took two and a half weeks. That really irks me. At the time they thought it was a genuinely dangerous virus but they still let kids go to school for weeks. </p>
<p>I just remembered this discussion after reading a comment on r/LockdownSkepticism and I kind of put it together. Now I’m pissed that in the event something really bad was going around, they’d keep school open for way longer than they needed to. I don’t know about other areas but I know several others that took close to three weeks to make a decision too.</p></p>

        <p>Virtue signaling. Everyone in my school thought it was a joke like me and friends were purposefully touching each other a lot extra on the last day (no homo) and people were like wearing halloween masks and being excited for a 2 week vacation. The rest is history</p>
