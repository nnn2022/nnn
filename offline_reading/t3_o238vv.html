        <p>Theyâ€™re going to reinvent ivermectin so they can create a profit angle. Nuremberg for these criminals.</p>

        <p>Correct, though I don't know that these anti-virals are that they are pushing.  Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug.</p>
<p>But you are correct about the profit angle.  I believe Merck is the company responsible for ivermectin, and they have been attacking it as a treatment.  It's been out so long that the patent is all dried up and it's super affordable as a generic.  It's not at all surprising to learn that they are creating a new covid medication.</p>

        <p>We know enough about SARS-CoV-2 now to start looking for alternative medicines to the currently used mRNA. Start funding alternative treatments and vaccines. Stop with this push for mRNA right now and get back to being humanitarian.</p>

        <p>A substantial amount of humans knew enough about excess cytokine expression (regardless of a lack of microbiology or those terms), which is the main underlying problem with COVID-19, 2000 years ago (maybe up to 14,000 years ago) to be able to treat it then.</p>
<p>In the past ~80 to 100 years, science has learned quite a lot more about ameliorating and suppressing excess cytokine expression.</p>
<p>The methods science knows of how to do that are using products of nature.</p>
<p>Products of nature are not patentable.  Only synthetic molecules can be patented.</p>
<p>Only patented products can earn the most ROI (until their patent expires) for the pharmacutical industry.  Even after their patent expires, their continued usage serves to help keep people on drugs.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry has some synthetic molecules to mitigate excess cytokine expression, but the main goal of all this BS was to fund development of mRNA technology, while continuing to protect and expand the current and future revenue of the pharmacutical industry and all their affiliates.</p>
<p>Protecting the current and future revenue requires keeping people in an ignorant stupor about what they could do for themselves to promote their own health without synthetic molecules.</p>
<p>I think this is why there's so many comments in this sub and related subs promoting various synthetic molecules; to make sure people's addiction to drugs is maintained, even if they won't get a vaccine for this virus.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical industry has gone to GREAT LENGTHS for many decades to make sure everybody has a drug problem, and stays in an ignorant stupor about taking personal responsibility for their own health.</p>
