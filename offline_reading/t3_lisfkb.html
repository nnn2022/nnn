    <strong>The biggest casualty of COVID: talking to strangers.</strong>
    <p><p>Iâ€™m 20 years old, and Iâ€™ve been pretty socially awkward my entire life. Iâ€™ve never really had a ton of friends and women have never been my strong suit, and once the lockdown set in Iâ€™ve started realizing just how alone I actually was. From then on, I made it a point to talk to more strangers. Even if I only see them that one time and then never again, I figure Iâ€™m still better for it. Socializing is a muscle if you work it, it grows and gets stronger. A lot of stuff is still locked down where I live, so itâ€™s not like I get to work this very often.</p>
<p>I had to catch a flight for work, and I figured it would be a perfect opportunity to talk to a stranger, theyâ€™re literally stuck next to you for 4 hours so itâ€™s not like they can run from you if you try to make small talk. So I get on the plane and this woman sits down next to me, wearing two masks and a face shield. I tried to strike up a conversation but I could not understand a word she said. Four layers of cloth plus a layer of plastic muffles up sound pretty good, and ya know, there was also a roaring plane engine in the background.</p>
<p>She seemed nice enough but she just shrugged me off after a few minutes. I donâ€™t take it personally at all, thereâ€™s a million possible reasons why she may not have wanted to talk to me that day, very few of which have anything to do with me, but I canâ€™t help but feel like ever since we started wearing masks, people want to talk to each other less. People donâ€™t even smile at each other anymore because whatâ€™s the point if your face is covered up? This isnâ€™t even the only story of this happening, I have a couple other things but I donâ€™t want this post to be a whole doctoral thesis.</p></p>

        <p>I got lucky a few days ago when I passively mentioned to a stranger that I am looking forward to shaking someone's hand again. And he actually shook my hand. It was a wonderful feeling for a minute to not think of myself as a bioweapon. Hopefully you can connect with a stranger soon</p>

        <p>Sadly, this is been going on long before Covid, what weâ€™re experiencing now is just the next step in the process.</p>
<p>A while back, Lionel Messi posted a video of himself scoring a goal and then a few days later he posted a picture of himself next to his Ferrari (or some other nice sports car, I forget what it was), and the the car pic had FAR more likes. A lot of people follow Messi because they admire what he does (which is a totally valid reason to follow him, heâ€™s the GOAT in his sport) but itâ€™s become very clear that by far most people follow him to jerk themselves off to his money. Itâ€™s left the point of admiration and gone off to the place where you just sit and watch from the sidelines. You donâ€™t try to learn anything from Lionel Messi, you donâ€™t try to be the best in your field because his story was so inspiring to you, youâ€™re just meant to sit back and look at how awesome you wish your life could be.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons weâ€™re in this mess is that people donâ€™t view themselves as equal to the people above them. To most people, Lionel Messi may as well just be an alien. He may as well be an entirely different species that is just on a separate level from the rest of us. They view our overlords the same way. The elites in the government keeping us locked down are all human, they have the same DNA that we do. We are on there level. The only difference is that there are 435 people in Congress, and over 300 million that arenâ€™t. We fucking own them if we want to. Theyâ€™ve just successfully black pilled enough of us to stop that from happening for the time being.</p>

        <p>Thatâ€™s why they are actively trying to ban guns &amp; take them away. Thatâ€™s basically our own line of self defense against tyranny. First they took your freedom of speech and to think, then next will be the freedom to defend yourself and so on.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I rent and at this point, looks like the opportunity to buy any land will be out of the picture forever barring a miracle in my life, so I can't really do this... but I've always wondered why more people don't booby trap their property. If one freak out in the boonies does it, the military comes down in force and destroys that MFer. If EVERY gun rights person who owned their house/land did.... the government wouldn't be able to deal any better than they did in Vietnam. That is, without just drone striking the shit out of their own country.</p>
<p>And speaking of Vietnam, it would be just like what our government actually did during that war, in Laos. "Oh we signed a treaty ensuring an independent Laos? But Vietnam immediately started breaking that treaty, so we might as well go ahead and secretly break it, too." They break the "rules" in every war, and then declassify the information about it 20 years later so that no one CAN hold anyone accountable at that point.</p>
<p>They've shown us that anything goes in war. They set up their "international laws" and then our own police force breaks them (tear gas, anyone?). Your rifle or pistol that you acquired legally, with your license that they issued (how kind of them to reaffirm through that license that yes, your "inherent" rights do indeed exist ðŸ™„), will do absolutely nothing against a team of 20 troops in full body armor with automatic weapons rolling up in a tank with some sarin gas in the trunk just in case. Your current "gun rights" are absolutely meaningless in the face of the kinds of weaponry (both legal and internationally illegal) our government wields.</p>

        <p>That's awesome man. I do the same. Anytime I walk around, I strike up conversations with people because I love experiencing life and real people. I try to envision myself as this sort of protagonist character walking around in a movie, and being that guy that always seems upbeat and has some sort uplifting charm, one of those rare people you don't encounter much, because every damn person is too much into their phones and what not. Seriously focus on the moments, and people will notice, even if subconsciously, and they will feel something refreshing and you will stand out.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™ll say itâ€™s not all bad, I met a guy today who was wearing a hoodie from his Muay Thai gym and I asked him about it because I train Muay Thai and I found out he is a retired professional kickboxer.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m gonna be lifelong friends with him or anything, I didnâ€™t even catch his name, but thatâ€™s kind of how itâ€™s supposed to go yeah? Some people you just talk to for like 20 minutes and then never see them again, and thatâ€™s OK. Thatâ€™s how things worked for all of human history up until the last year.</p>

        <p>Itâ€™s not like most people have interesting things to say until you both find a common ground together. Usually at first, itâ€™s the generic topics like howâ€™s the weather, food, traffic etc. 
when you reach a certain age, letâ€™s say around 30-40 years old, itâ€™s kind of hard to make new friends apart from being friendly and wanting a regular person to kick it with. Everyone is busy &amp; has their boring day jobs and families to attend to.</p>

        <p>What is it about public transportation that turns people into zombies? You can talk to a person on a plane or bus or subway and they will be the coldest person ever, but then talk to that same exact person in a bar somewhere and they will be the most sociable person youâ€™ve ever met. </p>
<p>Itâ€™s just something about being funneled into a little box with hundreds of other people that makes you not so cheery I suppose.</p>

        <p>City slicker here. To me public transit or walking down a street should still be considered my private space. Iâ€™m commuting somewhere I need to go, not trying to socialize and hang out. I donâ€™t owe charity fundraisers, panhandlers, horny guys, etc. anything, and Iâ€™m not rude to ignore them.</p>

        <p>I totally feel your pain bro!
I can only imagine all the lays im missing out the past couple of years on those apps since every girl there doesnâ€™t seem to have the right social skills and personality. No one seems to want to meet up these days, all those conversations end in meaningless teases and chats that lead to nowhere. Itâ€™s all about attention and validation on tinder nowadays. The pandemic didnâ€™t help at all. Even when Iâ€™m out in public, everyone seems so socially distant &amp; avoidant of each other. Wonâ€™t even look you in the eye for a second if you donâ€™t have a mask on etc.</p>

        <p>&rt;  ever since we started wearing masks, people want to talk to each other less.  </p>
<p>Obviously having something in your mouth restricts communication. And it's a sign of sickness. Why would you ever want to socialize with sick strangers? You can't even see their faces.</p>

I moved to the big city a few years ago and the worst about that was lack of smiling and people not greeting.</p>
<p>I can soon leave and I can't wait to see a cute smile again.</p>

        <p>Eh, I'd say losing my entire income and what little savings I had was the biggest "caualty" or COVID in my personal life. I really so miss talking to strangers though. I even miss those moments where you would both see something happen from different sides of the room, and then catch eye contact. Can't catch that little twitch of a smile anymore. In fact, all subtlety in communication is 100% gone.</p>
