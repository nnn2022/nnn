        <p>I was watching Star Trek: Enterprise "Chosen Realm" episode a few weeks ago, and Commander T'Pol, the logical Vulcan, said "Doubt is the basis of all scientific progress", and I thought, wow, that's gonna make some "Trust the science!" bleating soyjack science worshipper's head explode.</p>

        <p>I think you're confusing "I trust scientifically sourced evidence" with "the man the on the TV sad it's science".</p>
<p>Trusting a source is not the same as trusting evidence</p>

        <p>Uh. To start, the scientific method treats everything as a theory. Even when there is a ton of evidence. Did you fail 8th grade? Because that’s when I remember learning that. If I have to explain it further it’s your problem and I’m not interested.</p>

        <p>“The science”TM is not science itself. The bullshit around covid is perpetuated by the government and media and has very little to do with logic or the scientific method itself. A lot of scientists and doctors are against the vaccine and lockdowns but they either don’t speak out because they’re afraid of losing credibility, or they do speak out and get censored. </p>
<p>Is the idea of a “scientist” making up bullshit because they know people will believe it and they have an agenda really that impossible for you to wrap your tiny little brain around? Because if so I’m done wasting my time having this conversation.</p>

        <p>There is a big difference between qualified scientists questioning and being skeptical of their peers research, and average people on the internet thinking they are being informed by reading clickbait news articles and social media posts. You guys arent being skeptical, you are being ignorant.</p>
<p>Its honestly pretty simple:</p>
<p>- Gullible / uneducated people see manipulative media that makes baseless claims - "Human caused climate change isnt confirmed!" - "Covid isnt really that dangerous!" - "The election was filled with fraud!"</p>
<p>- They then start to fear "big government" and losing their "freedoms" whenever the government tries to make new policy or fix flawed systems.</p>
<p>- Manipulative (largely conservative) media &amp; political figures then points to conflicts and crises and use their baseless claims as "proof" that they were right all along.</p>
<p>- People then are convinced that all their fears are coming true, and the government, "elitist" scientists &amp; academia, and "agenda pushing leftist media" is to blame</p>
<p>And then the cycle repeats, and irrational fearful beliefs are reinforced.</p>

Imagine not understanding that the spread was slowed significantly by all the precautions being taken. Imagine not understanding that death rates increase when hospitals are filled to capacity and decline new patients. Imagine not understanding that death rate isnt the only statistic that matters. Imagine not understanding that one of the main reasons the US hasnt got covid rates under control is because there is a significant population of stubborn idiots who refused to follow basic precautions to help other people.

        <p>I'm British, leftwing -from here the Democratic party are absolutely far right-, and it's a Conservative government making all the sweeping lockdown policy.</p>
<p>To me, reference to 'science' (I have a Biology A-level, some uni level study) misses the point. It's not a value judgement, not a system of ethics. It can maybe tell you shutting granny away from her family for a year reduces her chance of catching covid, that doesn't mean you <em>should</em> do that, and there's no one answer to a question about what to do (why not ask her?). It's an avoidance of moral responsibility to hide behind science.</p>

        <p>There is also a big difference between science portrayed by biased media, and real science which is conducted and discussed by actual scientists and doctors, and used to make policy. I fully agree that most news sources have some level of bias and misinformation to them when reporting on science, but that isnt reason to start thinking science isnt legitimate.</p>
<p>As for the moral dilemma, western society is not structured to care for the elderly. We shove them in housing complexes and caretaker facilities so the middle aged and younger can fully commit to their career and schooling. People could take their grandparents in to live with them, and care for them personally during a crisis like a pandemic, but that isnt feasible given the commitment people need to make to their career. Its not a question of morals, its recognizing that the structures that form our society are flawed.</p>

        <p>As soon as it is used to make policy, though, it's politics, not just neutral 'science'. And, besides choosing what to do, the government choose their advisors to begin with. It's very obvious they serve them, often.</p>
<p>Science: bubonic plague, untreated, kills around 40–60%, or even higher. It spreads primarily through bites from infected insects, though can spread through exposure to bodily fluids.</p>
<p>In 1720, an epidemic of plague reached the city of Marseille. The city was placed under quarantine, under the direction of Nicolas Roze, who had volunteered for the role based on his past experience. Imagine his position: bodies pile up in the streets. In the poor district of la Tourette, ravaged totally by the plague, they have been there for weeks, described as crawling with maggots, scarcely any longer recognisable as human forms. To clear the bodies, there is the option of using soldiers, calling for volunteers, and of making use of forced labour, those who had been condemned to work on the galleys of ships. Most of those involved have an extremely high risk of dying. Of course, perhaps you can think of something else. So, in this position, what do you want to do? In that of Chevalier Roze, who should be involved? Imagining yourself instead in the position of the people of the city, do you want to volunteer? Here is an image to help you picture the scene that will result from going ahead:</p>
<p>https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Chevalier_Roze_%C3%A0_la_Tourette_-_1720.PNG?uselang=fr</p>
<p>If your only response is an appeal to science, I will think you are being disgracefully flippant.</p>
<p>A significant problem, in our covid pandemic, was in fact held to be multi-generational households, due to increased risk of exposure. That's not the point, though - many of the elderly can decide for themselves, and for those who can't, 'science' does not, cannot, decide what to do.</p>

        <p>An example from the 1700's isnt really scientifically relevant, their knowledge of disease and viruses was next to nothing. As for questioning morals in a situation like that, that is something that is constantly debated and has no conclusive answer. </p>
<p>Yes it is important to question the motives of politicians when they make scientific policy. However nonsense claims and fearmongering about "masks take away peoples freedoms" or "lockdowns and quarantine are just a government pushing an authoritarian agenda" is complete bullshit.</p>
<p>Nearly every single decision made in our society is based on science, so yes, science can 100% decide what is acceptable for people to do. Technology is developed through science. Medical practice and procedure is science. Economics is science. Education is based on science. Even sports is now largely based around science. So when people say "you cant question science anymore" or "science cannot decide what people do", you either have no idea what science is, or you are being ignorant to how society functions.</p>

        <p>They do not fully understand spread or the mechanism of the disease, they do understand the mortality risk, which is readily observable. I'm letting you decide <em>with</em> modern knowledge, though. So feel free to do something totally different.</p>
<p>Very well, though: you accept morality does come into it, and there isn't a conclusive answer. One further question, in that case: to what extent does the access to modern knowledge help with the problem? If you have, by time-travelling miracle, modern technology as well, medicine, you still have to work out how you're going to distribute it: science doesn't solve all aspects of logistics problems, it just provides information.</p>
<p>Science does not make those decisions. I don't think you appreciate how value neutral it is. It might tell you that dropping this neat invention called an 'atom bomb' results in mass deaths and could, today, wipe out all life on Earth. From that, you might assume the scientific conclusion is you shouldn't drop them on people. It's not, though, that's politics, ethics/morality, philosophy... Science just invented the nuke, it didn't tell anyone what to do.</p>
<p>And so far, I've allowed, for ease of argument, the idea 'science' is one unified conclusion. It isn't, it's a process, and a balance of evidence is what results. Scientific evidence goes into the claim that masks may reduce spread of covid. Some studies suggest they might -based on laboratory settings, without actual people or covid-, some don't suggest they might. Mask mandates, on the other hand, are political policy. They reduce the freedom of disabled people who have issues with masks to equal participation in public life. They remove people's own freedom to make sensible decisions about cost/benefit to reduce spread - eg., that they have already recovered from covid and have immunity, so it's unlikely they could spread it and no longer need to wear one.</p>
