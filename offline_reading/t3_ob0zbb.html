    <strong>How come most "democratic" countries became so tyrannical whereas most non democratic countries, not so much?</strong>
    <p><p>Canada, lol. We knew them as democracy angels, but look at them now. USA? Meh, although some states still fight against it. Most of Europe? Same. Sweden? Well surprisingly they are truly democratic, both in words and actions.</p>
<p>Whereas for example Turkey, Russia, none cares. In Turkey, masks are mandatory but still, none cares. Most people don't wear it. I don't wear one since last summer. Police has given up. Cases are 50k death in 10 million people. Around 40k people die in flu each year in Turkey. None dies of flu now(if you believe). And they postponed to release of the death statistics of 2020 like wtf? What the hell are they thinking?</p>
<p>Tbh, Turkey is Sweden in disguise. There isn't much restrictions just like Sweden in the real sense. Probably whole country might have been infected and got antibodies already. </p>
<p>I heard Russia is fine too. Not too much restrictions.</p></p>

        <p>The shithole countries like North Korea, Belarus, China, what-have-you are "free" because they succeeded in subjugating and oppressing their citizenry. They don't need the plandemic to do this.</p>
<p>Sweden is "free" because it's a globalist testing ground that's already doing or dabbling in shit like "free range living", vaxx passports, microchipping, and so on.</p>
<p>The rest of the western/democratic world needs to wear down their populations and destroy them in order to usher in the New World Order/One World Government.</p>
<p>All the world leaders are in on this scheme together, whether China, Russia, the US, EU, whatever.</p>

        <p>Seriously? You didnâ€™t remotely support/ promote China or anything remotely communist. But I am continuously surprised by how ignorant/misinformed/brainwashed many if not most people are now. It can feel very isolating. I have one friend IRL locally whoâ€™s on the same page. And I know Iâ€™m very lucky to have that.</p>

        <p>I've been truly surprised that we in Sweden didn't turn out as Canada since our government loves anything else related to the globalist agenda.</p>
<p>The "normal" people has been begging for the government to take their rights away to save them since this all started but it didn't happen. </p>
<p>People even seem like they don't care anymore. But we'll see when the delta fearmongering starts I guess.</p>
<p>Maybe since we're usually so compliant the elites cut us a break? Alot of people are willingly vaccinating without heavy restrictions so maybe it's just a waste of resource to use more propaganda on us. Or maybe we're just too small to matter anyway.</p>

        <p>Sit down.</p>
<p>The West is just as tyrannical as the rest of the world, but because you grew up in the West, you see it all as normal.</p>
<p>Also we tick a box every 3-6 years depending on nation.</p>
<p>All politicians work towards globalism anyway and con you the same. But the sheep are happy ticking the box.</p>
<p>Voting is two wolves and a sheep deciding what's for dinner.</p>
