        <p>When the public thinks about what "ICU capacity" means, they think of the number of available ICU beds divided by the total number of ICU beds. California has completely redefined the term so that the situation always seems more dire than it actually is.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&rt;The ICU capacity measure “is standardized to reflect effective capacity in ICUs by looking at the percentage of COVID-19 positive patients in the ICU,” the department wrote.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;So that would mean each region has an ICU capacity that is “adjusted” to account for the intense demand for COVID-19 care.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;CDPH says it calculates the adjusted ICU capacity based on the proportion of ICU patients who have COVID-19. “<strong>If a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is adjusted downward by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold</strong>,” according to the CDPH office of public affairs.</p>
<p>Here is an example calculation. Suppose that 50 percent of ICU beds are being used for COVID patients and 25 percent for non-COVID patients. The usual definition of "capacity" would imply that the remaining ICU capacity is 25 percent. But not in California! Because the percentage of ICU beds occupied by COVID patients exceeds the threshold by 50 - 30 = 20 percent, that means the capacity needs to be reduced by 0.5 * 20 = 10 percent, so the ICU capacity reported by the state would be 15 percent!</p>
