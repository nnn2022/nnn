    <strong>What is your personal cutoff date?</strong>
    <p><p>I think many of us, myself included, have only been continuing to play along with this farce because the end is "almost here" in the form of the holy jab, and presumably if we play nice it will go away on its own. But suppose the goal posts continue to keep getting moved, which they probably will. What's your line in the sand for taking to the streets? Challenging stores to kick you out for not complying, throwing superspreader parties at home, marching in protest, etc? </p>
<p>I'm thinking May 1st. Biden gets his 100 days to save the world, warmer weather is upon us, and the vaccine has had plenty of time to get to the people that actually need/want it. Or perhaps May 5, since we know much the PC babies hate cultural appropriation, and what a more fitting way to get back to normalcy than a national party?</p></p>

        <p>I was done in November. The longer you wait the more of these restrictions you 'accept'. Like a dog on a long chain, they remove the chain links one by one until the dog is so stuck he can't move his head, but he doesn't even know when this happened and how. That's us. Also if someone knows who said this example with the dog and a chain let me know cause I am looking for this interview.</p>

        <p>If they close my business again I will legitimately riot. </p>
<p>We wanted to peacefully protest in March, everyone said the libertarians were terrible people who should die if you wanted to gather in protest. Not even two weeks later people are gathering to riot for BLM and that was somehow different? So peaceful protest? Not allowed. Rioting? Okay? The message they have sent to me is that I will BURN SHIT TO THE FUCKING GROUND if they do it again.</p>

        <p>March 15 I’m never wearing a mask in public again. That’s when they started the lockdowns- one year ago to the day. </p>
<p>I’ve said masks are stupid and pointless from the start. But I mostly played nice cause I thought it made other people “feel safer.” Well screw other people’s feelings after a year of this garbage. If you’re still scared of this virus after a year, that sounds like a personal problem.</p>

        <p>2021 December 31st. I'm fine with it taking the rest of the year for the vaccine rollout/whatever that will get us out of this pandemic, but I don't think I can imagine us going a THIRD YEAR in this pandemic. Maybe everything except full maskless international travel returning by end of this year. I'll take that at least. But keeping everything as it is now in 2022 sounds crazy. I think by then everyone is going to just say `screw it, let the chips fall where they may'.</p>

        <p>The thread asked 'personal' cutoff date. I too do not think society can really handle another full year of the way things are now. I think the powers that be are not going to let this go on any longer than about August (if not sooner, but the latest will be August) for the USA due to the school situation. I think if we didn't have that big summer surge most schools would've been opening up this past September. Many people didn't realise how much the economy depends on the whole chain of schools being open to babysit kids whilst parents are at work. With schools closed, most companies that could do WFH even in low-virus areas had to stick to WFH. Similar deal with universities: with those being closed, students remain home with all that entails, instead of starting their adult lives away from the nest. I work for a local community college and I would be surprised if we didn't get called back to regular on-campus work in September 2021. Maybe the masks &amp; an attempt to keep distance will stick around with signs &amp; floor markings, less people in each classroom. At that point it becomes like the security theatre we got after 9/11 in airports. Everyone following it out of custom but knowing it won't totally stop the virus in its' tracks.</p>

        <p>Idk when the line was drawn, back in September maybe? I refuse to frequent places that won't allow me in without a mask, or harass me too much about it (aside from the limited medical engagements) . Once I put my foot down it's like the path was easier and I've had almost no one bother me about it aside from customers</p>
