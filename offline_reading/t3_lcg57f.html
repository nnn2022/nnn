    <strong>I was banned from my local subreddit for my wrongthink.</strong>
    <p><p>It took a month for the mods to take action on my comment. Decided to check in and waiting for a reply. Fingers-crossed it goes well!</p>

<p>Good morning! Just wondering if I'm still banned for wrong-think about liking to see people smile as it boosts mental health, a statement that was so dangerous it took a month for the mods to see and ban me over it. Just wondering. Thank you!</p>

<p>Can you make a positive impact on the community? As it is, you blatantly disregarded the health and safety of those around you. Millions of people have died from covid-19. People take offense to that.</p>
<p>Do you honestly think you are wanted here and can make a more positve impact than the negative 50 votes you received already?</p>

<p>If you are consistent and ban all the users whose comments were well-received and helpful (I'm quite proud of the one where I found someone's prized stuff animals at the park and tried to contact them with this subreddit) save ONE (where again, I was cordially pointing out I have a need to smile at people....especially after watching a documentary called The Bridge, watch it and grow some empathy, I know I did....in the face of this drawn-out, mentally-devastating, intentionally-divisive, politically-driven nothingburger of a fake pandemic per the CDC's own conclusions) then I have no qualms because hypocrisy didn't play a role in the ban.</p>
<p>Nice virtue-signal, though! Very on-script.</p>
<p>Have a good one.</p>
