    <strong>Confession from a college student</strong>
    <p><p>Over the past summer, I completely ignored all COVID guidelines and had possibly one of the best summers of my life.</p>
<p>Things I did would get me banned from most subreddits:</p>
<p>-sharing the same joint with my friends</p>
<p>-sharing the same pen</p>
<p>-drinking out of the same bottle</p>
<p>-sharing a bed with a friend</p>
<p>-walking around in public with no mask</p>
<p>-being in the packed car with no masks</p>
<p>-having 7-10 people a small room for hours at a time (with no ventilation ðŸ˜¨)</p>
<p>-talking to brand new people standing an arms length away from me with no mask</p>
<p>-travelled by plane more than 3 times for recreational purposes</p>
<p>Also, the summer job I have involves mentoring and teaching kids aged 5 to 14. <strong>We had over 1,000 kids come through our camp. Not a single one caught COVID-19.</strong> The ONLY person to catch COVID was a co-workers sibling (who didn't even work for us lol).</p>
<p>COVID is an overblown joke. Out of everyone I know who is around my age, only 2 people got COVID, and recovered in a few days. No young children got COVID despite them being in a summer camp and being in close contact with each other for hours a day. I go about my daily life and COVID is worry or think about.. until I go to social media and I am flooded with COVID-everything. It's a joke. Wake the fuck up.</p>
<p>What happened to the world? Get out and have some fun. Take some vitamin D (or better yet, sit in the sun for 20 minutes a day), Zinc, and don't be an obese pig. Put down the phone and go outside and you'll see life is fine.</p>
<p><strong>Fight the good fight. It's not you vs. me. It's the common people vs. the 0.001%!</strong></p></p>

        <p>I work in healthcare and see a lot of patients each day. I expected that age group to be the most defiant and skeptical of the restrictions. I found out pretty quickly that people aged 17-25 were the biggest pussies.</p>
<p>That being said, a small handful have shown critical thinking skills and have given me hope. I wish there were more!</p>

        <p>I wish everyone understood this, but sadly we still live in the matrix. Congrats on being a high IQ sentient. My buds and I rented Mclaren 720's and whipped around an LA with almost zero traffic last March, it was unbelievably legendary. Really, enjoying ourselves and being in a good place mentally is going to help A LOT later when more of these people become red pilled in a savage way, we're going to be needed to comfort and reassure them as many people's minds will literally break when they realize how much we've been lied to. I really hope that the awakened people in this sub will remain compassionate and actually help, rather than just be shitty and say "WE TOLD YOU SO DUMBASS." Because the world is shitty by and large because the elites feel superior to others in that way, and it's disappointing to see that animal farm kind of effect happening in here where everyone is sorta being snide and judgemental instead of trying to reach out and help wake others up.</p>

        <p>Can relate a lot to your post. In a nutshell, based off my behavior and lifestyle over the past year, statistically it is near impossible that I did not get sick nor anyone I know. And yet, I didnâ€™t. And neither did a single person I know. I would be the outlier of all outliers if COVID was as they say it is (but theyâ€™re fucking lying).</p>
