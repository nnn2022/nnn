    <strong>Anyone who thinks covid in dangerous obviously thinks the numbers of deaths are real. Thinking the numbers and stats are real then one considers the shot to “protect those at high risks”</strong>
    <p><p>We need to wake people up. Even people in this sub who be like “wah I hate lockdown restrictions but due to living with my high risk Aunt I just got my shot to be on the safe side for them”</p>
<p>Sorry what? You clearly think covid is more dangerous to you and others than this shot has already proven to be. Your aunt is old and fat right, ok she has a weakened immune system, she has a diabetes too. You think 2 experimental shots a month apart are going to be BETTER for you/her long term rather than a virus that neither of you have even had yet!?! With side effects that we KNOW about for covid at least?!? People like this, why are you here? Why are you putting your bodies at risk for a bullshit narrative that was created on lies on lies of PCR testing that are finally being brought to surface<a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/alexberenson/status/1387819126270353413?s=21">lies</a> </p>
<p>I’m all for telling people “if you want the shot get it I don’t care” .....</p>
<p>but to the people in this group..... covid isn’t dangerous to majority of population, we know that, and what happened to “if it ain’t broken, don’t fix it”? If you and your hypothetical diabetic fat aunt are FINE, WHY PUT YOURSELVES AT RISK? You’re just as much brainwashed as the rest in my opinion. This mentality of thinking shows you clearly are more fearful of spreading virus than the vaccine itself, or giving in to peer pressure by family who are brainwashed.  </p>
<p>I just don’t get it. If you’re fine you’re fine, you don’t NEED this shot, none of us do. Stop giving in to peer pressure, stop acting like this gene therapy “vaccine” is a savior for your high risk family. They want you to believe that. They want you to think you’ll kill your aunt if you don’t get this miracle shot. Stop believing any of these narratives holy shit guys none of it adds up if you’ve been following it closely.</p></p>
