    <strong>Public warning about doomers - cw: sexual violence and harassment</strong>
    <p><p>This post is meant to be a public warning about doomers in general, several of us have seen this type of behavior from one particular doomer who loves to hate us. Doomers want women who disagree with them raped and sexually harassed, and they think it's funny. There has been a recent incident on this subreddit where one user posted a horrific story of sexual harassment and threats from a doomer on Instagram. One commenter, a rape apologist, decided that it was appropriate to shame the poster for being harassed and for disagreeing with his personal views. Remember folks, doomers hate you and want you dead. They don't see you as human. Speak out against sexual harassment of women who refuse to blindly follow the media. Don't let this type of disgusting behavior from rape apologists slide.</p></p>

        <p>I saw that thread. Absolute scum.</p>
<p>Men need to take a stand in real life, too.</p>
<p>That friend who calls women "bitches"? Call him out.</p>
<p>That friend who has a child he never visits, and child support he doesn't pay? Call him out.</p>
<p>That friend who tries to get girls drunk to sleep with them? Call him out.</p>
<p>That friend who can't be bothered to get off his ass and stop playing video games to help around the house? Call him the fuck out!</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong><em>only</em></strong> <strong>group of people responsible for the destruction of the family in the western world are weak fucking</strong> <strong><em>men.</em></strong> Start honoring women as the life-givers, caretakers, and guardians that they are. Honor them by ceasing to be a man-baby and start contributing and doing things instead of being absolutely fucking <em>lazy</em> and casually abusive. Nut the fuck <em>up. Please!</em> I don't care if you start helping your mother, your sister, your girlfriend, wife, or daughter, odds are there is a woman taking up your slack. Hell, the only reason I can even be in grad school and on this God-forsaken fucking computer so much is because my wife at home is running and leading our family.</p>

        <p>Probably shouldnâ€™t be friends at all with someone who tries to get women too drunk to be able to consent.</p>
