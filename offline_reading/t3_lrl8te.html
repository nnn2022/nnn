    <strong>Why do doctors mention stupid post-covid symptoms?</strong>
    <p><p>Brain fog and cardiovascular issues? Aren’t we living in the shittiest mental and physical era in human history with record high numbers of depression and obesity, especially in first world countries? No fucking shit, 70% of the country are neckbeard armchair warriors and highly obsessed consumers drowning in debt.</p>
<p>I seriously do not get how DOCTORS (fauci) analyzing the research cannot at least disclose the complex external factors behind every new data that comes out.</p>
<p>And just for notes, I legitimately thought people exaggerated Faucis doomer agenda last year where I thought he was just doing his job, but it’s definitely true now. I still think that masks are good at preventing nasty droplets coming out of walmart mouthbreathers in general, and old/fats should be vaccinated if they want, but I really hope this doesn’t dip into “post-covid symptoms” holy shit get me out.</p></p>

        <p>They need to keep the charade going until they install their fascist agenda. Science has got nothing to do with it, other than running cover for the scammers.</p>

        <p>They need something to keep the panic and “severity” up. Doctors would also realize that mutations are expected and typically less severe than the original strain, but you hear them spouting panic over the new ones every day. Why? Because suddenly they have the soapbox they’ve always wanted and the ability to lord extra control and “power” over others, if the panic dies down they lose this. </p>
<p>Post viral fatigue is a thing. It always has been. It can happen with any virus. Look at things like mono-it’s well known that it can mess you up for months with symptoms lingering that long and lasting fatigue but they don’t shut down the world and do all this shit for that, and I’ve never heard anybody panic over it. They got people panicked and not thinking straight and then started feeding more panic shit for them to hold onto.</p>

        <p>Mainstream is so focused on droplets when the disease is AIRBORNE. NOT DROPLET-BORNE. The masks don’t protect you from any coronavirus particles (which is how the virus is transmitted). It is not transmitted by SPITTLE</p>
