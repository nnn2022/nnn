        <p>The ‘bad’ scientists get ostracised from the scientific community. Look at Andrew Wakefield and his demise after his infamous ‘link’ between vaccines and autism. There’s a reason why peer-reviewed journals exist and ALL of them deny this link. Unreviewed articles and baseless opinions from people with influence are the reason vaccine misonformation is so rampant across the world. </p>
<p>Not my intention to get heated, just looking for a civilized discussion</p>

        <p>“Civilized” discussion you say, big lol. 
Academia is nothing but a joke. 
Fuck you, I don’t need to “debate” you like some kind of nerd in order for there to be a “civilized” discussion. It takes generations for academia to change because of internal politics, academia is nothing but people pretending to know shit. 
Ignaz Semmelweis the scientist that pioneered antiseptic procedures was ostracized by his colleagues to the point of him getting panic attacks. The man behind the creation of the radio was mentally institutionalized by his “friends” after coming out with his invention. The crazy ideas of today are the greatest truths of tomorrow. 
Point is, the scientific community is in many ways as dogmatic as religion. I’m all for science, but not for “the scientific community” aka. academic jerkoffs. 
So again, don’t try and be all cute and ask for people to spoonfeed you information. Any good scientist looks it up themselves. Idiot.</p>

        <p>Just looked up Semmelweis’s story and yeah, it’s absolutely horrendous what happened to him. The difference between him (and every other great scientific mind who was ahead of their time) and Wakefield was that Wakefield used flawed methods to intentionally defraud the community. There were no double-blind tests, no hypothesis tests, no formal link. His paper is just a massive lesson on why ‘correlation does not equal causation’ is such an important issue in technical writing. In Semmelweis’s time, Germ Theory was not yet accepted, and so his ideas (and others like Jon Snow and his famous cholera map) were indeed thrown out. Back then, the barrier for entry into the sciences was much lower than it is today. Now, you actually need critical thinking and extensive knowledge of the topic you are going into.</p>
<p>Regarding the guy who invented the radio (Guglielmo Marconi I assume you mean), he was well padded in medals and received almost universal support from the scientific community.</p>
<p>I definitely agree with you on the point that today’s crazy ideas are the greatest truths of tomorrow (I mean look at Einstein and his paper on the Theory of Relativity). I’d argue that these ideas regarding the questionable safety of vaccines are not crazy, I can see why, on the surface, it’s okay to question what’s going into your body. The fact that literally every well-written source is saying that they’re safe (and a much better alternative than getting sick with the disease) is when the whole ‘look it up yourself’ argument breaks down. </p>
<p>The scientific community, by its very nature, has to be dogmatic. However it’s important to remember that all these horrors of institutionalisation and shunning happened before the age of Information. Today, academic papers reach a wider audience than ever before: anyone in the community can submit a theory to rival the dogma. The only way that breaks down is when someone starts delibarately using flawed data to mislead: you’re not going to lose your job or get pushed out for following the scientific method.</p>
<p>You bring up these examples of people getting ostracised, and yet end your paragraph telling me to look up the information myself. Would it not have been easier to just give me a few pointers for ‘my own research’?</p>
<p>The fact that you’re saying you don’t need to debate me like some kind of nerd did raise a few red flags, especially cause you started debating the sentence after. I appreciate the effort you put in, and hope we can remain civil.</p>

<p>But refused to social distance, refused to wear masks, refused to stay home to reduce the spread, allowed children to get sick.  Literally did everything possible because “it was just a flu”.  But now you’re posting memes about how this virus was made by scientists?</p>

        <p>The virus was released either by accident or by malice around Nov 2019 (there are no doubts about this, look up gain of function research, no bat soup BS). The initial form of the virus was lethal but viruses mutate quickly. So, the lethal form of the virus either killed its host and stopped spreading or mutated to an infectious but harmless form. Now, about 2 years later, it's just a flu.</p>

        <p>According to official sources, in the US the virus alone was responsible for a small number of deaths of the overall reported number. </p>
<p>To attribute the slowing down of cases/deaths to the vaccine won't be entirely accurate either. To begin with, the test reported a lot of false positives (even a 99% accurate test of a disease with a 1% prevalence will have 90% false positives). Next, the CDC stipulated that post-vaccine infections/deaths will not be credited to the virus. </p>
<p>But, most importantly, any infectious disease can be made less deadly by ensuring healthy people come in contact with each other (look up primary and secondary immune responses). Look at China, they stopped testing and lifted lockdowns to hide the numbers and inadvertently developed herd immunity.  </p>
<p>This theory fits perfectly when we look at India. Here, the second wave only commenced after the vaccination began in mid-Jan. Last year the cases did begin to decrease but herd immunity could not be fully developed thanks to strict lockdowns. So, when the vaccine was introduced, people's immune systems were overwhelmed and they fell sick. It also allowed the virus to mutate and it once again became infectious to those people who had achieved immunity previously. Now, after months of spreading it once again reached the critical number and the cases are decreasing again.</p>
<p>To sum it up, yes, provided a correct response, it could have been 'just a flu'. The insane lockdowns did screw the pooch.</p>

        <p>“According to official sources, in the US the virus alone was responsible for a small number of deaths of the overall reported number.”</p>
<p>That’s false and it shows a misrepresentation and misunderstanding of mortality data.  Death certificates don’t just list one cause of death.  That’s why most covid death certificates list contributing causes of death (pneumonia, cardiac arrest, ARDS, etc…).  Those conditions would have never manifested in the victim without covid. </p>
<p>“To attribute the slowing down of cases/deaths to the vaccine won't be entirely accurate either. To begin with, the test reported a lot of false positives (even a 99% accurate test of a disease with a 1% prevalence will have 90% false positives).”</p>

<p>Plenty of herd immunity going on right here. Thought they lifted lockdowns? 🤔</p>
<p>“This theory fits perfectly when we look at India. Here, the second wave only commenced after the vaccination began in mid-Jan.

<p>This is all wrong and not how anything works.  </p>
<p>“To sum it up, yes, provided a correct response, it could have been 'just a flu'. The insane lockdowns did screw the pooch.”</p>
<p>No. You didn’t prove or summarize anything. </p>
<p>You just don’t understand how to read basic mortality data, are unaware of world events, and struggle to link cause/effect.  </p>
