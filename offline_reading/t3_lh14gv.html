    <strong>Extremely helpful tip to make people realize how stupid they are about masks.</strong>
    <p><p>Just go ahead and ask them genuinely: “What is the micron size of covid particle virion? I want to make sure cloth masks can prevent nano particles from passing through as this is a virus and not a bacterial infection.”</p></p>

        <p>I have a friend who called out this mask bullshit from the start with me. He paints cars and wears a respirator mask. He said he still gets some paint around the places the mask covers, that’s how he knew they were lying. That, and the fact that they’ve flip flopped so many times. </p>
<p>I also deliver medical supplies for a living. You know what it says on the box for surgical masks? Does not protect from coronaviruses! </p>
<p>I can’t wait to see all these double maskers get hospitalized for bacterial pneumonia, it’s absolutely insane. That’s why I wear a rolled up bandanna at work, so I can breath out the bottom AND not get in trouble. If this pandemic is SSSOOOO deadly, then there should be biohazard bins for these masks. Instead, I see them all over parking lots.</p>

        <p>Covid particles are as small as 0.06 microns. Where are you getting the info that “Most covid particles are going to be bigger than it” and also: N95s are not recommended for public use. Disclaimers on N95s also read in fine print: “Do not wear for over 30 minutes can result in sickness or death.”</p>

        <p>It says “Misuse may result in sickness or death”. I got my statistics from cdc.gov. Viruses are never pure coughed out they are always bonded to something. Typically they will be bonded to saliva and mucus. Talking and coughing on average produces particles around 1 micron in size. It is true that a pure COVID cell will pass through but that will not happen because it will always be bonded to something.</p>

        <p>Eh mine says misuse and not to wear more than 30 minutes... Do you think it’s possible that whatever it’s bonded to can be pressured by cough or sneeze through fibers of masks resulting in the particles filtering and becoming even smaller than they were? Or is that a “no, no”.</p>

        <p>Yes that may be possible. I do think however that the general effectiveness far outweighs the potential ineffectiveness. Weird that yours says only 30 minutes. Everyone I’ve seen including my own just says misuse.</p>

        <p>What are your thoughts on mask causing acne? It seems to be a big topic in recent discussion. Doesn’t this imply the collection of bacteria? Should people wear a new clean masks throughout the day and wash their face periodically? I’m genuinely asking, I think masks are useless. At the beginning I thought they helped but after a whole year, finding out all the people who got covid I know were avid mask advocates - I call BS. And I’ve traveled for work all over the states and didn’t catch the vid - or if I did it did absolutely nothing to me.</p>

        <p>Just for clarification masks do not limit your intake much just your outtake. If you have COVID and cough you are most likely not going to spread it to them if you are wearing one. But if someone coughs on you and you are wearing a mask you are still gonna get it most likely. They aren’t really meant as filters more like nets. I haven’t seen anyone get Acne recently. One of my friends had it really really bad up until March last year. I don’t think masks would contribute to that unless you wore them for a long time. You should wash or change masks at the end of the day. Medical masks are one way Mirrors. It prevents you from coughing and getting stuff everywhere but if someone coughs on you without one you are still gonna breath it in from the sides</p>

        <p>I got you and I appreciate this genuine opposition to what I believe because it’s mad rare on reddit and love logical cordial discourse. But honestly man, it’s been over a year - there’s not a grain in you that thinks that the masks may not be making the slightest difference? Or that the numbers are inflated? Or that it’s being abused and pushed with fear-mongering to allow political overtake? I’m just curious.</p>

        <p>I believe they are making a difference but not in America. 60% of people i see are wearing a mesh knit piece of cloth that does nothing or have it like halfway up their mouth. As someone who has family who works in the ER and sometimes COVID unit the absolute last thing they want would be the numbers to be inflated. My aunt came home from work crying due to the absolute despair she has to witness dealing with COVID. I am always open to changing my mind but I want to see hard data first. Thank you for being a rational logical person. Tried to talk to my conspiracy theorist dad about it and he started immediately spouting about BLM and pedophiles and did not want to have any sort of scientifically discussion.</p>
