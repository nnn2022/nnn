    <strong>How do we explain 100 million doses of the vaccine being distributed but only 3.4% of Americans have received them?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m open to getting this vaccine, my step-father has received it as he’s a doctor, and his side effects were just feeling like crap for about three days after and he’s fine.  I’m not worried about Pfizer or Moderna spiking these vaccines, but I am worried that our state and federal governments aren’t rushing to get everyone this vaccine.</p>
<p>It seems like such a slow roll out?  Why not vaccinate everyone ASAP if this is the worse thing to happen in the 21st century?  </p>
<p>I live in Ohio and our governor is making groups of people (I.e schools, nursing homes, hospitals) agree to things such as, in schools, going back to in person classes by X date in order to get staff/students vaccinated?  This makes absolutely no sense.  How are WE tax payers having to agree to anything to get the damn vaccine that supposedly prevents host infection that’s ruining the world?</p>
<p>I am absolutely so over this whole fucking pandemic.  I’ve lost three job prospects over it being a fully qualified experienced veteran and have been so negatively impacted by all of this.  I quarantined/isolated, stopped seeing family, but my mental health is deteriorating from lack of social stimulus...I’d rather fucking die from this god damn virus than obey this shit that makes no sense, with no end.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is ranty but I’m just so done.</p></p>

        <p>Why would you want people to be forced to get an experimental vaccine that isn't even effective? If you think everyone getting the vaccine means we're going back to normal you're very confused.</p>

        <p>No, I’m simply stating that why is it not public ally offered.  I’m not saying you should be forced to get it, but we have the vaccines, the states know how many to hold for high risk/health care staff, so fucking offer it.  I’m really hitting at: if this is so bad why aren’t you making this widely available.  Please don’t read into what I said.</p>

        <p>No, I’m with you on that. I’m just getting quite upset at such a slow roll out of this vaccine if the pandemic is such a big deal?  You’d want you people vaccinated, right?  Open your economies back up, right?  Then why say “you can get the vaccine if you agree to X”. That right there shows the BULLSHIT of this whole fucking thing.  There shouldn’t be “agree to X and get X in the worst thing to happen to us in the modern age”. At this point I want to move into the fucking woods to get away from all this BS and just live my life.</p>

        <p>Everyone has a choice.  I’d say I’m a man of science and seeing first hand relatives that have received it they seem fine.  I’m not promoting getting vaccinated but questioning the governments delay in getting people vaccinated if this is such a bad pandemic</p>

        <p>I hear you and agree. I just think you saying you’re a man of science then saying you’ll take it bc your relatives “seem fine” is a bit off the mark. </p>
<p>Not trying to call you out- only interested in preventing needless vaccine injuries. Good luck either way.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I’ve just taken some classes on microbiology and understand what the vaccine does on a micro level, so, I am not worried about that, but rather long term side effects of which I haven’t seen any.  My step-father seems be doing okay two weeks after but reports he’s still “groggy.”  I never meant to insinuate I’d take it, not like I even have a choice to take it up to this point.  </p>
<p>I like this sub because it questions government intent.  I do not like it when it puts science last and opinion first.  There is fact and there is lies which the government has spearheaded.  We must be able to see through BS while accepting scientific fact.</p>

        <p>You ask a question but you mention in the majority of the post how you are for the vaxx and how others should be convinced to get it too... I'm not trying to start anything but that is not cool, especially given that the vaxx is not effective in transmission or prevention and maybe just maybe helps lessen symptoms and we don't know enough about the experimental vaxx but we know that it's caused severe symptoms and several deaths.</p>

        <p>They also realized this problem, and this morning I saw my mother gone and the news paper reading "Hundreds flock to local clinic" here in CA they are now giving it to 65+ people. Idk why they don't just say "Hey, if you want it come get it." I'm happy it's not required for me! Plus, I think they "estimated" that EVERY "frontline worker" would want it. Even here in CA many nurses are refusing it.</p>

        <p>Feeling like crap for 3 days is worse than getting covid for most people.  What's the point? I won't be getting it, I'm at no risk from the virus so if the vaccine even has a remote chance of damage, the risk reward is not worth it to me.  This equation might change if you're very old, frail and ill.</p>
