    <strong>A Pandemic of The Vaccinated – Does The Vaccine Create a Pathway For A More Dangerous Variant?</strong>
    <p><p>I don't give a damn what anyone has to say about the SOURCE. I'm so tired of seeing all the scared people crying about where an article comes from. Just because something comes from a website, or news outlet or wherever, with the word conservative in the name or title or somewhere on some page, that doesn't mean the information is less important or credible. Yes, there are some shitty sources of information out there, on both sides of the aisle but, I am so damn tired of all the whiner babies bitching about anything, from a source, that doesn't fully align with their political ideologies. I don't choose my news and info based on politics. I identify as politically neutral. I work very hard to avoid getting caught up in an echo chamber, where I only hear and see what I want to hear and see. (This was not directed at most of the members of this sub. It was a preemptive strike against the outsiders who visit this sub, just to complain about information sources and to display other childish behaviors)</p>
<p>With that being said, this is a great write up from a solid source. Sundance is one of the few left that provides a rare independent analysis of topics and issues. You will find some interesting info about the tricks being used that allow our media and medical folks to make statements like, 95% of the infected are unvaccinated. The data and statistics provided here make it clear that being vaccinated isn't really doing shit. </p>
