        <p>So I was in a CBD store yesterday. My sister and I were the only 2 customers in the whole store. You need a mask to enter. Fine. As soon as I was in I pulled it below my nose. The cashier was nice and didn't care and was helping us. This fucking purple hair cunt comes out of the back just to tell us to pull our masks above our noses and then went back to the back. I took my mask off fully instead paid and left. I'm not going back until they get their shit together because it took every ounce of my being to not go off on Barney the dinosaur.</p>
