    <strong>My experience taking a family member to get the vaccine:</strong>
    <p><p>Zero complaints, all of the workers were <em>very</em> friendly, however a couple of things happened that I thought were strange. First, before we were allowed into the building our temperatures were taken.  I asked what mine was, the guy calmly said "90". Another person in line overheard, so there was some slight conversation, and then he took my temperature again.  This time he calmly said "93".  After a little bit more conversation he told me that I was "between 90 and 93".  This was after standing in line for more than an hour in sunny Southern California.  The very nice gentleman taking temperatures seemingly had no inkling to question the accuracy of his tool.</p>
<p>Secondly, after getting the vaccine you are asked to sit in a chair for 15 minutes 'just in case', but as soon as you stand up an attendant <em>immediately</em> comes over to sanitize the chair.  In fact, just to be sure, you're given a piece of paper to leave on your chair to alert the attendant that it needs cleaning, but that wasn't necessary at all.  I was curious about that because I thought it was no longer considered to be a 'surface to surface' threat anymore, but I don't really know.  Either way, I don't see how someone sitting in a chair would somehow 'deposit' the virus only to have the poor sap following him 'pick it back up', through their clothes I guess, and then BAM, now they have C-19.  But maybe it makes sense in a way I don't understand.</p></p>

        <p>It seems it was never about actual science. We have to take our temperatures to walk in a certain area where I work ( a church). It doesn’t matter that everyone supposedly has a temp of 93 or 94. What matters is that they go through the motions and record everything like they’re supposed to. </p>
<p>The church is offering “limited” and “ social distanced” services each weekend. We tell people to sign up so we can limit the numbers. But, no one is checking at the door to see if people signed up or not, and no one is being turned away if the place is full. But we still have to send out a sign-up link every week.</p>
<p>They took all hymnals out of the pews, no offering plate is passed, the bathroom doors are propped open so no one has to touch anything. Then after church is over they walk through and spray all the pews with disinfectant, in case a single germ might survive there for the next 7 days. It doesn’t matter how many times I try to tell them that surface transmission isn’t a thing... they still do it because <em>rules</em> and <em>guidelines</em>.</p>

        <p>And to be fair we didn't know what we were dealing with at first.  But we pretty much do now.  In the beginning they put yellow tape around all of the amenities in the parks where I live, and took the basketball rims down.  Little by little those things have changed (for the better) but it's like people just don't feel comfortable to go back 'too fast'.  Like, it was so scary, I just need to slowly recover.</p>
<p>That's how it seems to me at least.</p>

        <p>Usually when you get vaccinated there is a process where your body "sheds" the virus. Usually since the virus that they give you in the shot is a dead version, I won't do anything to anybody, but it's a safety precaution. Also a lot of the time hospitals are a very scary place for people, so doing stuff like making a show of being sanitary and kind to people would make it a more inviting environment for people who truly need the treatment. So I'm sure some theatrics are involved somewhat</p>

        <p>Your temp was 90-93, better call an ambulance because you have hypothermia and are most likely frozen , are you sure thats not your O2 or Pulse?  Thank goodness you do NOT have a fever... sigh.</p>

        <p>I didn't <em>feel</em> cold ha ha.  I also asked the guy if it was true that with those things you don't <em>have</em> to point it at the forehead, and he was of the opinion that that's correct, in fact you can point it at any part of the body and get the same reading.  But they still point it at everyone's forehead for some reason.  I decided not to pursue that conversation because it would have seemed like I was being pedantic.</p>
