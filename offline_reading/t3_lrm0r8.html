    <strong>I'm so tired of hearing the same things over and over.</strong>
    <p><p>Every "argument" that the pro-lockdowners and maskers use I have heard before. Have you noticed that, too?</p>
<p>Today, my dad said "Just plain common sense should tell you to take basic precautions!"</p>
<p>Like, no, these "precautions" aren't basic, and there is no reason for me not to live my life completely normally just because one more virus is out there. I see no reason to live my life any differently. Then he goes into this whole thing about how no illness has ever been this bad, blah blah blah, and I said how very few people who get it die, and he just said "Well, it's hell for the ones that do!" As if that changes anything. Not many people die of the flu, or pneumonia, or tuberculosis, but I'm sure it's also hell for the ones that do, but we don't stop living our lives and reroute the way we live because of it. I'm so tired of people telling us about how bad it is for the people that die as if we don't already know that. They're completely missing the point. Pretty much everyone who dies, does not go peacefully. Whether it be in fear because of an oncoming crash, in pain because of an illness or physical trauma, or in grief because you just don't want to go yet, very few of us will die peacefully, warm and comfortable in our beds, and surrounded by our grandchildren and loved ones. Basically, my point is that suddenly people are caring about all people out there that have died from the virus, when they don't care if they die from anything else, people that they don't even know. During flu season, the deaths of the flu are never pinned on the society at large for "not protecting them." It's just considered their luck and their time to go. And honestly, why is it any different now?</p>
<p>And all the crazy lengths people have gone to, guess what, people still died and there is no doubt in my mind that the number of deaths (the real number of deaths, not the inflated number) would have stayed exactly the same without this hypochondric paranoia. The way people are reacting to this virus, it's insanity. Literal, medical hypochondria and paranoia, which is a mental illness.</p>
<p>If he's one of those scared people, whatever, my mom's like that too, but he keeps switching. One day, he's totally with me, the next, he's totally against me. I just wish he'd make up his mind. One day, we're completely in agreement, the next, he's regurgitating the same idiotic pro-lockdowner, pro-masker talking points. You never know with him.</p></p>

<p>Yes. I've been through this as well, including with my own parents. They'll be like "Wow, you're right, the government is lying" one second, then literally the next they'll say "Be careful, you could die with Covid so wear your mask and social distance!"</p>
<p>I discussed this phenomenon with someone else here a few weeks ago, and we came to the conclusion that this is a form of disassociation. Deep down, they realize the truth, but then they go back to their "programming" by regurgitating the same talking point their friends and the media use, because the truth is just too much for them to handle, so they retreat to the "safety" of what is being told to them.</p>

        <p>Yeah. They care SO much for the people dying of Covid, that they don't even let them see their family one last time. I'm sure the pain from dying WITH Covid is bad, but I'm sure dealing with it alone makes it FAR worse. What compassion!  They care so much for these people! </p>

        <p>Yes! Dying with anything is probably going to be really bad, but unless it's the corona virus, they just don't care. You died in a car accident? At least it wasn't covid!</p>

        <p>But then when a doomer's parent is dying because the hospital won't bring them in for their cancer treatment, they blame antimaskers, even though we always see empty hospitals. "Oh, YoU GuYs ArE StUpId! ObViOuSly ThE CoViD paTiEnTs aRe In AnOtHeR PaRt oF ThE HoSpItAl"</p>
<p>Well, then the hospitals aren't full then, are they? "Full" means EVERY inch of that hospital. And if there are areas in the hospital that aren't holding Covid patients, then why can't their cancer riddled parents' go to that side of the hospital for treatment?</p>
<p>This whole thing STINKS of EVIL. But I guess it's easier to blame us then the ones pulling the strings.</p>
