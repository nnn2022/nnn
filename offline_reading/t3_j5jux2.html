        <p>Same in IL. It's almost like strapping a moist gross rag over people's faces that they fiddle with to make their hands extra gross before they handle door knobs and credit card readers might make things worse, just like every pre-March doctor said before they got terrified of being cancelled.</p>

        <p>It’s so gross.</p>
<p>If people want to wear them go ahead. I have no issue with that. Mandating something with no scientific evidence as a way to ‘do something’ and use to against other people so politicians have their scapegoat? No.</p>

<p>There are NO randomized, controlled trials (RCT)with verified outcomes that show a benefit to healthcare workers or community members for wearing a mask or a respirator.

        <p>It's like locking your front door. Sure, I guess that is 1 of level of protection, but if you leave all your other doors and windows open, did locking your front door really protect you at all? I suppose it may have thwarted one random thief too lazy to check any other entrance, but I'm fairly confident that if a city enacted a You Must Lock Your Front Door Mandate, it would have no effect on the over number of robberies.</p>

        <p>Hold on, since you’re trying to make this “locked door” comparison between a house and a human, let’s examine a few things, shall we?</p>
<p>If you’re locking your front door, or our mouth and nose in this situation, you’re insinuating there’s other means of entry for a robber, or the disease. Now, since it’s nearly impossible for the disease to enter your ear and infect you (source: biology), then that leads me to believe you’re not covering open wounds, damaged walls maybe, or other orifices; anus or genitalia. And if that’s the case I think you do need to lock those things down, for the sake of everyone around you.</p>

        <p>The point is that just locking your front door doesn't really do anything. Just as wearing masks doesn't really do anything. Like Fouci even said, a mask might block a droplet, but it doesn't provide the protection people think it does. People are constantly taking their masks on and off, touching their faces, rubbing their eyes, using old masks, only really wearing them when they go to the store, and countless other things that negate the any usefulness the use of a mask might bring. And at this point the data clearly shows this. Almost without exception, where ever mask wearing has been mandated, there has been no measurable impact the spread of Sars-Cov-2.</p>

        <p>They can mitigate the chance of someone who is actually sick spreading the virus to you. This is how all respiratory viruses work, not just covid. If someone was sick with the flu and had uncontrollable coughing and sneezing, then wearing a mask would mitigate the chance of you getting the flu from them if you were in a room with that person (and by mask, I mean surgical mask, not the useless cloth masks that 90% of people are wearing). It doesn't mean that it would completely protect you from getting the flu, but it would reduce the likelihood, by at least half. This is why if you've ever been to a clinic or doctor's office during flu season, they always give people displaying clear symptoms masks to wear while they sit in the waiting room, near other people. But what society is doing right now...with 1. the majority of people wearing cloth masks (which are too porous to actually mitigate anything) 2. Most people just wear or re-use the same mask for an extended period of time, instead of switching to a fresh, clean one every couple of hours and 3. people constantly fiddling with their masks and setting their masks down on bacteria-laden surfaces when they take them off to eat, or get in their car, etc...all that not only doesn't do anything to mitigate the spread of the virus, but can, and does actually make things worse because people just increase the risk of bacterial infections through the rampant improper use of masks and also the wrong kind of mask (cloth). Then add to that even more nonsensical premises....the entire stupid premise of everyone wearing masks at all times is based on 1. asymptomatic spread (which is so extremely rare that it is virtually non-existent) and 2. the premise that everyone perpetually has covid at all times, instead of covid being what it really is...a mild respiratory virus, that if you do contract it and have a normal immune system...your body will completely get rid of it within the span of a few days and you'll have immunity. All those reasons are why the way masks have been implemented is such asinine medieval quackery.</p>

        <p>These considerations were I believe one of the drivers for the "masks are useless" propaganda we saw at the beginning of the pandemic, only for them to completely reverse course without giving and communicating any explanation. The results overall have been nothing short of hideous.</p>
