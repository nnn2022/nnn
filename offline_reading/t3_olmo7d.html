    <strong>So here we are, sitting on the brink of the precipice</strong>
    <p><p>Vaccines are already failing. It was clear to anyone with a brain between their ears that after all they've done over the last 16 months and counting this was <em>never</em> about public health to start with. But that's stuff we know.</p>
<p>What we <em>don't</em> know is what's behind the sudden push towards having everyone vaccinated as soon as possible. I should use "vaccinated" in quotes now, cause it's becoming clearer and clearer that whatever the fuck they put into that shit is definitely not a vaccine and it's not to protect anyone from the super coof.</p>
<p>Why the rush? It's dangerous. Macron is literally going all in with the 2.0 nazism he's trying to implement. The whole continent of Europe, especially southern Europe, is a powder keg. The only thing that keeps the wheel spinning is the constant inflow of free government money that keeps most of the population at ease, at home, watching Netflix. But for how long? Prices are already rising visibly, and most of the population is living (free)paycheck to (free)paycheck. Especially the young, who have nothing to fear from the corona coof and have everything to lose from the lockdowns. </p>
<p>Will the young notice, at some point, that their future has been stolen from them with the silent approval of a generation that had literally everything and just had not to have it go to shit? That same generation which we are now (supposedly) sacrificing everything to, to keep them save from the coof?</p>
<p>I don't know, really. I feel that whatever the government will force on the public, the public will take it. No matter how preposterous, or logically unsound. We've seen curfews, we've seen "no talking on the metro", we've seen schools closed and pretty much no one under 20 has ever died from this. We will see more, and the populace will take it. Here in my corner of Europe, they've already been whispering "they're gonna lock everyone up again come winter". Like it's an inevitability. After having around 90% of the population at risk "protected".</p>
<p>TV is not even trying not to look like the official propaganda anymore. They say things like "70% are in favour of more restrictions". Nobody believes that. Still, everybody goes along with it. Feels like the soviet russia I read in the books when I was young.</p>
<p>Not sure what's coming next. Doesn't really matter at this point. We're sitting at the brink of the precipice.</p></p>

        <p>Because it becomes more obvious every day that they are no good. Gotta get as many people before they realize it. Doesn’t matter if you realize the bullshit after being “vaccinated,” there is no going back.</p>

        <p>I just got an unwanted dose of mainstream news and it seems like they're cranking up the fear to absolute maximum. For a while I thought we were out of this but it looks like the virus people are doubling down, and the msm is going with it. They are so desperate for ratings after Trump left, they will do anything to get and keep viewers.</p>

<p>Even with their distorted definition of herd immunity, it doesn't make sense.</p>

        <p>The undoing of all that was is not at the hands of strictly one generation, but several. The fault lies within those who said and did nothing generations before, this stuff doesn’t just land in your lap as a shit sandwich. A piece of bread here, a turd there, some cheese after this event, another slice of bread from any other event, and finally the olive on top. If you’d prefer the snowball rolling down hill use that instead. 9/11 was not the start of this, it actually goes back as far as the 1860’s in terms of the US’ decline. History is repeating itself, and we are here to witness it. Do the best you can now, yes things will get exponentially worse, but if you are ready for those hard times ahead you will be okay for a while. Everything eventually runs out. Don’t give up good people, keep your heads up, stay in the verbal fight, and get ready for the physical (which isn’t far off). Take care friends, make every day count with your children and family, and enjoy life.</p>
