    <strong>Im sick of being looked at like a terrorist</strong>
    <p><p>I live in a small village on Long Island. Every day, I got for a walk out on the town. Because I'm outside, I dont think it's necessary to wear a mask. Some people, however, dont feel the same way as me. Over the past month, I did this weird social experiment with myself and how other people would interact with me mask vs no mask.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The first 2 weeks, I got the death stare from pretty much every age range who was wearing a mask. Young, old, whoever, looked at me like i was the plague. I had older people tell me "put on your mask young man", or "you should really be wearing your mask". Some old asshole veteran tried fighting me on the street, with his wife right next to him. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The last 2 weeks, were a completely different story. People not running off the side walk because they think I'm a human dirty bomb, not one word said to me. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Its really crazy how far peoples heads have gone up the proverbial ass of this whole pandemic. People thinking they're heros because you wear a mask on the street. Woopty fucking doo people. Go crawl back into your holes and leave us people trying to live our lives alone.</p></p>

        <p>What gets me is the posts in other subreddits.. People claiming they're having "mental health issues" becuase they saw someone in the grocery store not wearing a mask..</p>
<p>"now I have to book another test for me and my kids because people weren't wearing masks in the grocery store, seeing people ignore social distancing and not wearing masks is seriously putting my mental health at risk" </p>
<p>Like pull your head out of your ass. Mental health issues becuase you saw someone not wearing a mask? What an insult to those actually struggling with depression and mental health. Book ANOTHER test? Maybe dont bring your 6 kids with you to get groceries if you're that concerned? You're not helping by getting yourself tested every time the wind blows. You're prolonging this shit.</p>

        <p>Especially since the PCR tests in a lot of labs up until VERY recently were being run at way too high a cycle rate.</p>
<p>Gold standard is &lt;30 which leads to almost no false positives. Anything above 31 gets you exponentially increasing false positives where at 35 cycles, the test is almost 97% false positives.</p>
