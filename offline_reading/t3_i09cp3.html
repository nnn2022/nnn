    <strong>We are experiencing narcissistic/psychopathic abuse</strong>
    <p><p>There are people with personality disorders in my family, so I have read a lot about disorders and have also experienced a lot of the techniques. I can't stop thinking about how the people of the world are experiencing narcissistic abuse on a global scale right now. It is very eerie to me. Below is a list I grabbed online of some of the tactics people with personality disorders use on their targets. I've removed the items that don't match up. but a lot of them work in the pandemic situation.</p>
<p>This form of abuse is extremely insidious. I know from experience that it's hard to wake up to it even when you desperately want to do so. Anyone who doesn't want to wake up, will not have the fortitude to do it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You feel on-edge around this person,</strong> <strong>~~but you still want them to like you~~</strong>~~.~~ <em>You find yourself writing off most of their questionable behavior as accidental or insensitive</em><em>,</em> because you’re in constant competition with others for their attention and praise. They don't seem to care when you leave their side—they can just as easily move on to the next source of energy.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Cuomo didn’t realize the deadly consequences of forcing nursing homes to accept covid patients. Who could have predicted the suicides and drug overdoses? Economic collapse?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lies &amp; excuses</strong>. There is always an excuse for everything, even things that don’t require excusing. They make up lies faster than you can question them. They will always blame others—it is never their fault. They spend more time rationalizing their behavior than improving it.</li>
</ol>
<p>We were basing our decisions on the data we had at the time.  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Insults you with a condescending, joking sort of attitude</strong>. Smirks when you try to express yourself. Teasing becomes the primary mode of communication in your relationship. They subtly belittle your intelligence and achievements. If you point this out, they call you hypersensitive and crazy.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Anti-maskers are degenerate idiots. Conspiracy theorists are narcissists.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Uses social networking to provoke jealousy and rivalries while maintaining their cover of innocence</strong>. They once focused all of their attention on you, but now they post ambiguous videos and statuses to make you doubt your place in their heart. They bait previously denounced exes with old songs and inside jokes. They attend to new activity and ignores yours.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Mask debate, lockdown debate, vaccine debate  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You find yourself playing detective</strong>. It’s never happened in any other relationship, but suddenly you’re scrolling back years on their Facebook page and albums. Same with their ex. You’re seeking answers to a feeling you can’t quite explain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hmm  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hyperbolizes emotions while displaying none of them</strong>. They make passionate statements like “I’ve never felt so happy in my life” in a completely robotic voice. It sounds like an alien trying to explain how they imagine human emotions might feel.</li>
</ol>
<p>My grandma!  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You are the only one who sees their true colors.</strong> Others will think they're the nicest person in the world, even though they are used for money, resources, and attention. They won’t care because he/she strategically distracts them with shallow praise (often done over social networking). Psychopaths are able to maintain superficial friendships far longer than their relationships.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes.  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Accuses you of emotions that they are intentionally provoking</strong>. They will call you jealous after blatantly flirting with their ex over social networking for the world to see. They will call you needy after intentionally ignoring you for three days straight.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Yes, you selfish whining bastards who just want to be left alone and put food on the table.  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cannot put themselves in your shoes, or anyone else’s for that matter</strong>. You find yourself desperately trying to explain how they might feel if you were treating them this way, and they just stare at you blankly.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s 1,200 bucks to get you through five months. Lost your business? Bummer.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You find yourself explaining the basic elements of human respect to a full-grown man/woman</strong>. Normal people understand the fundamental concepts of honesty and kindness. No adult should need to be told how they are making other people feel.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>No adult should be telling others when they can leave the house.  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Focuses on your mistakes and ignores their own</strong>. If they're two hours late, don’t forget that you were once five minutes late to your first date. If you point out their mistakes, they will always be quick to turn the conversation back on you.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It spreads on surfaces, no, it spreads in air, no . . .</p>
<p>Anyway, these rising numbers are because of you selfish people who want to get your hair cut.  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The ultimate hypocrite</strong>. They have extremely high expectations for fidelity, respect, and adoration. After the idealization phase, they will give none of this back to you. They will cheat, lie, insult, and degrade. But you are expected to remain perfect.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We’ll make you pay if you don’t wear the mask, but we only wear it occasionally.  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sometimes it seems as though they've forgotten who they're supposed to be around you</strong>. They adopt different personas for different people—transforming their entire personality to match various audiences. It’s always very eerie when they slip and accidentally use the wrong mask for you. You will start to feel that their personality just doesn’t seem to add up.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Is Trump the devil or the savior? Biden? Democrats? Republicans? Faucci? Gates?  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Flatters your deepest insecurities</strong>. If you’re self-conscious about your looks, they'll call you the sexiest person in the world. If you’ve got a need to entertain, they'll say you’re the funniest person they've ever known. They will also mirror your greatest fantasies, playing whatever role is necessary to win your heart.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You stayed home! You are a deeply caring person with a lot of empathy for others!  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Frequently comments about what you’re wearing and how you look</strong>. They try to arrange you. You become obsessed with your appearance, noticing flaws that likely don’t even exist. During and after the relationship, you will spend significantly more time in front of the mirror. </li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Where’s your mask, covidiot?  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Obsessed with humiliating successful, kind &amp; cheerful people</strong>. Delighted by the idea of breaking up friendships and marriages. If you work hard to maintain interpersonal peace in your life, they will make it their mission to uproot all of it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>How many of us have lost friends because of this?  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gaslighting</strong>. Blatantly denies their own manipulative behavior and ignores evidence when confronted with it. They will become angry if you attempt to disprove their delusions with facts.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Yes.  </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Selfishness and a crippling thirst for attention</strong>. They drain the energy from you and consume your entire life. Their demand for adoration is insatiable. You thought you were the only one who could make them happy, but now you feel that anyone with a beating pulse could fit the role. However, the truth is: no one can fill the void of a psychopath’s soul.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, we must all focus on covid 24/7. None of us can get enough of Trump, Faucci, and Gates. Please put them on TV some more!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your feelings</strong>. After a run-in with a psychopath, you will feel insane, exhausted, drained, shocked, suicidal, and empty. You will tear apart your entire life—spending money, ending friendships, and searching for some sort of reason behind it all.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>My own additions: </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shifting goal posts</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Flatten the curve . . . until there’s a vaccine.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Perverting your sexuality</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Glory holes good. Intimacy bad.</p></p>

        <p>Thank you. I want to reply to another comment you made about other people not seeing. I feel like we are brainwashed from birth to believe that everyone has good intentions and is just doing the best they can. I can't even believe how long I bought into that story.</p>

        <p>I had a similar journey to you, in that I escaped my narcissistic family members, only to feel trapped in a country with politicians who behave the same exact way. It’s difficult to understand unless you’ve actually lived through it yourself, but thank you for trying to convey the disturbing parallels. I felt the same way about this from the beginning, and it was so disheartening because I am already in the extremely long process of recovery from emotional abuse. Seems like the lefties only care about survivors of abuse when it’s convenient to them. </p>
<p>It was really cool of you to make this post. Thanks again.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the kind words, and I am sorry that you went through that as well. I've been through three levels of waking up to it: people in general, family members, government. One paranoid fear I have is that there are more levels to it after we die.</p>

        <p>Thank you for the kind words, and I am sorry that you went through that, too. I guess in some ways, we are more mentally prepared to deal with what is happening now. </p>
<p>I try to look for the rays of hope. I had lunch in a restaurant today in the state next to mine. I didn't know they had recently mandated masks, so I had to go out to my car to get my bandana, and the other two tables there saw this happen. When I got back inside, there was a group discussion, including the staff and the other four patrons, about how insane this all is. Not everyone is brainwashed.</p>

        <p>Yes. Great observation. The global world economy, the system of oppression and keeping the rich man wealthy. Every developed nations culture and a few old world religions are completely built upon the premise of psychopathic abuse.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, and I get it. I understand the people who refuse to see, too, though. When that veil comes off, it just knocks the tar out of you. Just brutal. In my opinion, it requires a great deal of strength to look at the truth straight on. I am glad you did it.</p>
