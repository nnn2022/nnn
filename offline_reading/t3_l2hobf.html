    <strong>Is anyone else kinda hoping covid lockdowns continue because the possibility of this all being a political move is incredibly disturbing?</strong>
    <p><p>I always joked that this was a political move but I never thought I would actually see things that point to it being possible. A few governors changed thier tune, Cuomo, lightfoot and... I forgot who else. Testing for positives now requires more tests. Other stuff that I can't exactly remember.</p>
<p>What made me feel truly sick though was Joe Rogan talking to Tulsi Gabbert. She said she wouldn't be surprised if the lockdowns were all a political move to take out Trump. I know no one was put into concentration camps but that feels like Hitler level shit.</p>
<p>People are so fucked up now mentally and financially and it was all possibly exaggerated because orange man bad? At least Hitler had the decency to kill his victims.</p>
<p>I'm really thinking we need to make a hard push as citizens to replace them all. I'm 100% Republican but if our political system is willing to destroy us to get votes then we basically need to replace them.</p></p>

        <p>One thing I've caught on to is:  Never put too much stock into what people say.  Look at what they do.  Everybody's saying lockdowns are ending.  Well, ill believe it when I see it and not a moment before.</p>

        <p>No. I want the lockdowns over, full stop. I want life to return to the way it was, <em>without</em> being forced to undergo constant health surveillance in exchange. </p>
<p>What disturbs me isn't the idea that all of this was to stick it to trump. That would comfort me: petty party politics, a sign of normalcy. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I see a lot of plans for fascist control of people being attempted on a global level, and when I look at whose money is behind it, the signs point to a group of companies/nonprofits who think and act on a global scale: the Gates Foundation/GAVI (never forget that they are the WHO's biggest funder!), World Economic Forum, Mastercard, Pfizer, Amazon.</p>

<p>How were the lockdowns in the rest of the world related to taking out Trump? We're still in lockdown in the UK but orange man is gone already. Gonna need a new theory.</p>

        <p>Well what if the world is doing what it would normally do but American politicians wanted to affect the elections so they modified their actions to hurt or help Trump. There's some Democrat politicans here that have been all about lockdowns. They never changed their tune, up until a few days ago. Now a few of the most pro lockdown types here are saying stuff like "we should really consider opening up more.".</p>
<p>Almost 10 years ago now a really crooked guy here said "Never let a good crisis go to waste.". I don't know if you have any interest in listening to Joe Rogan interview a American politician but the Tulsi Gabbard interview is fantastic.</p>

        <p>I cant stand listening to Joe Rogan. It's all 'me me me.' That's what I hear anyway.</p>
<p>I've heard that theory too, that they're going to start backing out now. I think it's going to happen all around the world though. I hope so</p>

        <p>The problem is even if this was all a game some people won't go back to 2019 life now. They might be so scared of getting the rona that they never live like they did in the past again. This messed with people bad. A simple handshake might terrify people for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>If people are scared of touching someone else for a handshake they aren't going to be willing to go anywhere they don't need to. On top of the mental damage how many people are out of jobs now? How many businesses are dead now? And that's just going to add mental stress to a society that is already in a shaky place mentally.</p>
<p>This is going to be all sorts of bad for years.</p>

        <p>"If the lockdowns were all about Trump, then why did the rest of the world go along with it?"</p>
<p>I've seen this argument many times.  I don't really have a great explanation other than the other countries were simply caught up in the ruse.  I don't know how, and I don't know why.  I think that will be revealed later.</p>
<p>Consider where governments got their information, and took advice on what to do with that information.  Were they all taking advice from the WHO?  If not, why did they all end up making the same decisions?</p>
<p>If we turn the question around the other way: Why did every country in the G20 essentially take on the same measures?  </p>
<p>And why wasn't there more of a public debate about these decisions?  There are plenty of scientists and doctors out there who disagree with the public health measures.  Why did countries choose not to listen to these experts?</p>
<p>Here's another clue.  Why are all leaders of every single country in the G20 talking about "Building Back Better" (in exactly those words too)?  Was that also just fortunate happenstance?</p>
<p>I don't know why other countries went along with this.  I suspect the answer to that question is far more sinister than we could ever imagine.  Governments didn't all just wake up one day and decide to completely cripple their countries for no reason.  </p>
<p>Where did they get their information?  Why did they listen to some experts, but not the others?</p>
