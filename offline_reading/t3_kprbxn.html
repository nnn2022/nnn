        <p>Didn't even know Clarkson had it</p>
<p>the dude is fat as fuck, takes zero care of himself, smoked heavily for most of his life and drinks more in an average weekend than most people do in a year.  If he was able to shrug it off by taking a couple sick days at home.  How much more proof do you need that it's not the super-plague guaranteed death sentence it's been hyped up as....</p>

        <p>Same with Trump when he got it. He was fine after a couple of days. </p>
<p>The first time I started to realize this can be easily beaten was when Georges Laraque, a former NHL tough guy who has asthma, got it and was hospitalized. It made the hockey news. He went in on Tuesday and was out by Thursday and he said he would do push-ups and walk around because he knew if you have it, you shouldn’t stay still. He said there were people in the same wing that just lay there and didn’t do anything, and that’s why nothing changed. So if I get it, I guess I know how to handle it</p>

        <p>Honestly, I hadn't watched any of the Grand Tour when it first came out, and when I finally saw an episode I remember how shocked I was at how awful Clarkson looked. He was like a dying man, struggling to walk with his enormously bloated belly.</p>
<p>This is a man that actually doesn't give a fuck about his health. I'm glad he also doesn't give a fuck about being popular lol.</p>

<p>Most illnesses affect different people in different ways. We're not trying to generalise it. We're trying to say that we don't think it was worth stopping the world and ruining everyone's lives in the process in an attempt to save your friend from feeling tired when walking up the stairs.</p>

        <p>You must be joking.</p>
<p>Setting aside the fact that that in no way implies covid "will definitely kill everyone who contracts it" the survival numbers are posted all the time. Headlines like "300 people infected leading to 12 deaths" or similar are also published frequently. If a person can't extrapolate from that that 288 people survived then we have bigger problems to deal with.</p>

        <p>Like an utterly failed education system. </p>
<p>Seriously though- I don’t know what news sources people are consuming but none, and I mean none at all, have claimed, or even hinted at the idea that covid “will definitely kill everyone who contracts it”.</p>
<p>There’s hyperbole- and then there’s just plain absurd.</p>
<p>But hey- if you want to link me to some articles making the claim that covid kills everyone I will be happy to re-evaluate my position.</p>

        <p>No you are right. But they <em>do</em> play fast and loose with CFR and IFR and other stats to make you <em>think</em> the situation is worse than it is.</p>
<p>Or .. spend 4 paragraphs talking about how CASES are SOARING before quietly dropping the unremarkable death info at the end of the article.</p>
<p>But I agree that the press has never said that everybody who gets covid will die from it. Although they almost write their articles in the tone as if this were true.</p>
<p>To the point where <a href="https://imgur.com/a/MFp3khh">a poll showed that people thought that 9% of the country had died from covid</a>.</p>

        <p>&rt; Or .. spend 4 paragraphs talking about how CASES are SOARING before quietly dropping the unremarkable death info quietly at the end of the article.</p>
<p>:shrug: We’re already at 350k dead and that’s going to climb past half a million before all is said and done. I’m not sure I’d consider half a million dead “unremarkable”. 350k dead is 7-10 times more people than are killed by an average flu season which everyone kept comparing covid to. 500k dead would be almost as many people as were killed during the civil war.</p>
<p>Media in this country is a for-profit endeavor so they love attention grabbing headlines- but as you said- that’s a far cray from claiming covid kills everyone. But at the same time- it’s still a lot more dead than a lot of people are willing to admit.</p>

<p>What if I said I wanted to find out how many of that 350,000 should <em>actually</em> be counted as "obesity deaths"?</p>
<p>So .. what should I do? Well I could test all of them and see which ones qualified as "obese". And then if they had died from any obesity-related issues (heart-, blood pressure/stroke, diabetes-, etc) I could say that obesity had something to do with their death. Or at least .. if they <em>hadnt</em> been obese, they would have been stronger and they wouldn't have died.</p>
<p>So .. give me 150,000 of your deaths and we will call them now "deaths with obesity", even though they happened to also have covid at the time they died.</p>
<p><em>Because it's all a matter of how you classify deaths</em>.</p>
<p>If we classified flu deaths the way we do covid deaths (ie - "if you die with some strands of influenza virus in you, it probably had something to do with your death"), flu deaths would end up looking much bigger too.</p>

        <p>&rt; 350k would be 4-10x the non-pandemic range of flu moratlity.</p>
<p>No, it's not. From the CDC:</p>
<p>"CDC estimates that influenza has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010."</p>
<p>If we take the minimum of 12,000 and maximum of 61,000 then it's 6-30 as deadly- I was simply ignoring the outliers.</p>
<p>&rt; we count flu differently than covid, comparing the two numbers directly is disingenuous</p>
<p>No, we actually don't but feel free to post some actual evidence if you like.</p>
<p>&rt; we start the count over each season for the flu, and should similarly with covid. the 1969 pandemic flu is still around!</p>
<p>It hasn't even been one year yet so unless you think we should be counting multiple flu seasons per year- which we don't- this is an absurd argument.</p>
<p>&rt; most of those 350k covid-assigned deaths didn't have covid at the time, because our only tool to assess (other than the doc saying "yup, probably covid", which is enough for a cdc-approved death certificate) is pcr, which is incapable of assessing current infection.</p>
<p>Yes- doctors are incompetent and because a person might have had covid they are listing that as the cause of death in all cases.</p>
<p>Seriously- who, exactly, do you think is coordinating this wide ranging conspiracy?</p>
<p>From Scientific American:</p>
<p>&rt; How hard it is to accurately determine whether COVID-19 was truly that last straw depends on the situation. Most COVID-19 deaths seen at Mount Sinai Health System in New York are in people who have comorbid (or co-occurring) conditions such as coronary artery disease or kidney disease, said Dr. Mary Fowkes, the chief of autopsy services at Mount Sinai. But it’s not typically difficult to tell what killed them.
&rt;
&rt; “Most of the cases are pretty straightforward,” Fowkes told Live Science. “The lungs are usually so severely involved with pathology, so they are two to three times or more the normal weight of a normal lung.”"</p>
<p>So no- we know what is causing these deaths. But hey- if you have some actual evidence to back up any of your claims- then by all means- post it and I will be happy to review it.</p>
<p>Besides- we have excess deaths which have also been analyzed and come out to roughly the same number as reported deaths- and we have similar results from around the world so I have no idea why you are trying to deny reality. What does that get you?</p>
<p>You can believe masks aren't that effective or that closures aren't worth the economic cost- but trying to deny the number of deaths is just delusional.</p>

        <p>Their website and pages may be poorly self-consistent.  70k deaths in the chart I showed you, and an estimated 40-60 million infections last year.  </p>
<p>We absolutely treat covid deaths differently than every other disease, because on March  24, CDC released COVID Alert #2 (google it, it's on their site) describing how to record covid deaths, based very closely on the wording from the WHO a couple days prior.  No other disease allows us to count a trauma, suicide, or drug overdose as a death from a cold because RNA fragments happened to be in the body at the time.  No other disease is diagnosed solely based on a PCR positive, in some states and countries (this doesn't seem to be cdc) a PCR test any time in the last 30 days (like sweden).  No other disease counts every death where the doctor at the time thinks, in the absence of any positive test, that some cold virus happened to contribute.</p>
<p>Cold and flu season is well understood, even as it varies by climate, from papers going back decades.  This is a new cold and flu season, and evidenced by new cold surges.  The March-April deaths were the end of the previous cold season, and covid has been in the country since November or maybe October of 2019.  We simply didn't start testing for it and recording deaths until that March 24 CDC memo.</p>
<p>Doctors do not have the time, money, equipment, or inclination to test whether everyone has an active case of covid.  They're relying on the PCR test which is not capable of making this distinction.  This is bio 101 stuff (literally have bio textbooks in my office to which I can refer you.).  PCR detects RNA.  It can't tell if it's alive, cultureable, making someone sick, making someone contagious, ramping up before a person is sick, defeated and being overrun by the immune system, either a fresh immune response or because of a previously trained immune system, or completely dead and just not yet flushed out, which can take MONTHS.  So we're calling cases and deaths based on insufficient data.  This is not how medicine has worked before, and leads to wildly inflated and incomparable numbers.  If you can't understand this point you're pretty much lost.  The numbers you're seeing do not reflect people who are sick, people who are contagious, people who are in danger, or people who died due to this virus, because we are simply not testing in a manner to determine such.</p>
<p>As to your question on why/who?  Well, read up on the 2009 swine flu.  The WHO redefined pandemic to include it, we ramped up testing to aggressive levels, rushed a vaccine, whipped people in to a panicked frenzy, got Fauci on board to preach doom to his followers, all for a disease that killed VERY few people.  There are ties between those who developed the testing protocols and research journals, testing equipment manufacturers, and vaccine producers.  The WHO also stated that it wanted to use the tragedy to bring about societal change.  Are these the actual reasons, or are people just stupid, scared, and love hearing bad news on TV?  Dunno.  It really is a mystery why the UK, NY, Cali would tear themselves apart if they new better, but the politicians are all out partying, dining, and traveling, so they clearly aren't actually worried.  They just enjoy the "political theater" as it were.</p>
<p>We have a huge upsurge in suicides, drug deaths, crime, etc.  It's probably worth counting to see how badly the lockdowns hurt people, and how many of those excess deaths are from the lockdown, not covid.  We also had VERY mild previous flu seasons, and if you ignore health context, you're missing a great portion of the situation.  (For most of US/europe, 2018/19 and 2019/20 flu seasons were extremely mild prior to march, so lots of vulnerable past their QOL years). Since you simply cannot prove covid is killing huge numbers of people without autopsies (and we have some of those, showing the difference between "death from covid" and "death <em>with</em> covid") you're relying on circular logic, that covid is awful and deadly, to confirm the numbers.  It kills people, but based on the data from around the world, excess deaths are not up.  2020 deaths are well within normal ranges for all of europe, asia, india (i haven't seen south america data, and africa is all around too young for covid to be a threat).  If you look at some longer trends for any country, you'll see how tiny this year's increase actually was.</p>
<p>If you're curious, look at Ivor Cummins data/presentations, where he goes in to great detail about all cause mortality numbers.</p>
<p>Read up on the paper used by the WHO to mandate the extremely flawed testing protocols:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346483715_External_peer_review_of_the_RTPCR_test_to_detect_SARS-CoV-2_reveals_10_major_scientific_flaws_at_the_molecular_and_methodological_level_consequences_for_false_positive_results</p>
<p>Please read and understand the WHO and CDC directives on how covid deaths are recorded, because nothing else is recorded this way nor counted this way.  If we tested everyone for rhinovirus and recorded every death with a positive test as a "rhinovirus death" you would see the same numbers, because everyone gets colds, and lots of people die, especially the old and infirm.  Assuming that covid is killing all of them when we have estimates that nearly 1 BILLION have had it, most without even knowing they were sick, makes no sense.  The fact that it's only dangerous if you're very old or very sick (nursing homes are 40+% of deaths, median covid death is OVER the average life expectancy) means disentangling covid stats from people who already had terminal illnesses is quite hard.  We're not trying, literally making no attempt to distinguish "deaths with" from "deaths from", and it leads to drastically inflated numbers.  At least a third of this country has had covid at this point, (cdc estimate of 90 million prior to this cold season starting) by the testing regime we're using, which means, barring too horribly skewed distribution, (roughly) a third of those who died from anything would have tested positive for covid, remembering RNA can remain in the system for months after exposure.  If you don't take this in to account when creating summary stats, you're either failing to understand basic statistics, or doing so intentionally, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>If I could get you to understand one thing, it would be that the numbers you're seeing attributed to covid are based on one poorly designed test relying on the misapplication of a (otherwise really awesome) tool. If we can't accurately diagnose someone with covid unless it's extremely severe, what does that do to the overall numbers?  The answer is we don't have that data, because we're not collecting it, but we simply have to be overcounting.  And then all the models that rely on those case/death stats are also wrong, because they don't take that in to account.</p>
<p>Find someone who works in a lab and ask them how many cycles they're using for their PCR.  If they're following mfr instructions (as filed with the FDA) it will almost always be 40-42.  Ask them what that means in terms of virus viability.  </p>
<p>Heck, look at the covidtrackingproject data, and see how closely most states, and the US as a whole, align case counts with testing volume.  If you double your tests over the course of a month, and find double the cases, either the same percent are sick, which means that ISN'T changing over time, or the test is reporting a great deal of false positives.</p>
<p>All the data is there, you just need to look at it, and ignore twitter, facebook, cnn, politicians, etc.  Find experts on both sides of this discussion and listen to them talk, debate, present and analyze data.  If you let cnn pick your experts for you, you're not trusting experts, you're trusting cnn (or facebook, etc.).</p>

        <p>It also implies that those who died weren't "fighting hard enough", when cancer doesn't work like that. You can be perfectly compliant with treatment, do everything your doctor tells you and still die. Or you could do the opposite of what you're supposed to and still live thanks to good luck. Having "won the battle" with cancer doesn't make you any better or stronger than the people who lost.</p>

        <p>No battle is guaranteed to be won just because you decided to fight rather than give up.</p>
<p>No cancer is the same for everyone. Therefore, you aren’t ‘stronger’ than anyone just because the outcome was different. </p>
<p>Sometimes fighting is just about giving yourself a chance or extending the time you have to live. </p>
<p>Did you honestly think cancer was a thing that was objectively ‘beatable’ by everyone if they reached a certain level of effort? Where have you heard such a thing?</p>

        <p>Has <em>anyone</em> died from it without being on a ventilator?  It's widely known that ventilators damage lungs and cause a wide array of infections and deaths <strong>without</strong> covid involvement. </p>
<p>What happened was terrible and not a one off. It's happened to alot of people. I think the way these patients are being treated is beyond reprehensible. I also think the treatment stems from the overdramtization of this disease. </p>
