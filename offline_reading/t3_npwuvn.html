    <strong>Workers still making me wear mask even though their policy changed it to optional</strong>
    <p><p>I had a conversation with chase bank beforehand online to verify that masks are no longer required. They confirmed this for me. And now I just went to chase and they still told me to wear it. I told them I'm vaccinated, they said I still have to wear it. I showed them the conversation I had online, and they told me this branch still requires. How is that the case? Does each chase branch operate independently?</p></p>

        <p>They probably want to avoid the liability that could stem from different municipalities requiring different levels of restriction, so they leave it up to the individual branch (or possibly region) to comply with each of their local ordinances. Who knows, though. It could just be some rogue weirdo middle management types trying to exert just a tiny bit of power on their underlings.</p>

        <p>That happened to me at petco. Signs everywhere mandating masks in store, but when I emailed corporate, they said they were optional... even though I was told I had to wear one.</p>

        <p>My bank forced me to wear one too. I told them I thought people only wear masks when they rob banks, &amp; they told me to leave.</p>

        <p>Sadly even with HIPAA and the ADA businesses are still allowed to mandate PPE.  They may consider masks to be such.   I had customers I had to visit long before any of this nonsense where full beard net, hair net, smock, shoe covers, and yes.. masks, were required for any on the plant floor.</p>
<p>I would suggest getting a letter from your doctor saying you cannot wear one for health reasons.  They cannot ask what those are (HIPAA) and they cannot discriminate against you for it (ADA) but be warned they can still shit can you just because it's Tuesday if you're in an "at will" state.</p>
<p>Edit - sorry I initially read this as you were an employee.</p>
<p>I'd just take my money out and go somewhere else.  Make sure you do it LOUDLY.</p>
