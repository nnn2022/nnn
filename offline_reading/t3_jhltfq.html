    <strong>The manager comped by breakfast today - was it because I don't wear a mask?</strong>
    <p><p>In a previous comment, I mentioned a situation that involved a concerned customer handing me a box of masks while I waited for breakfast:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jcbze1/reddit_helped_me_defend_myself_today_at_the_store/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jcbze1/reddit_helped_me_defend_myself_today_at_the_store/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>
<p>This morning, I received my custom breakfast and went to ring it up at the cashier station. The person on the register was the manager who had spoken to me in previous interactions and overall was a very nice person. Without explaining why and without asking, he simply told me that breakfast was free for me today. In response, I told him that I'd pay it forward; to that end, I plan on buying someone else breakfast the next time I'm there.</p>
<p>Could it be that he has grown tired of the mask mandates and appreciates my example?</p></p>

        <p>I donâ€™t think most people who have to work 8 hours a day with masks like it.  I walked into a family owned takeout place and the owner went to put on his mask and I said no need to do that for me.  When I got home there was a free desert in my bag.</p>

        <p>That's pretty awesome that the owner of that place showed his respect for your decision to respect his humanity.</p>
<p>When I go to another store and ask the people about the constant wearing of a mask during work, they all say they can't stand it. This one dude at the deli always asks where my mask is (because I once went in with a paper towel taped to my face and we all laughed) and that is my cue to rant about it for a few minutes.</p>

        <p>I had a maintenance dude come over for something and he started putting his around his chin when he realized I didn't care.</p>
<p>Everyone is afraid of offending others but once one person signifies a lack of fear it can often be reciprocated.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's necessarily to show appreciation for what you did. Hotels live and die by their reputation, he was probably just trying to prevent bad publicity, to get back on your good side in case you felt 'harassed' by the other guest and were about to give them a bad review.</p>
