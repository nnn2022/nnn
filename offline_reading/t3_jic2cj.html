    <strong>Ireland has officially entered a police state</strong>
    <p><p>IT IS NOW A PENAL OFFENCE TO....</p>
<p>Have family members from more than one household come to your home to comfort you if someone in your house dies. </p>
<p>To organise or attend a religious ceremony. </p>
<p>To sell children’s shoes. </p>
<p>To go beyond 5km of your home if a Garda decides your journey is non essential. </p>
<p>To organise or attend a protest</p>
<p>To take part in a strike if you live more than 5km away. </p>
<p>It will be 100% at the discretion of the Garda who apprehends you to decide whether or not you are committing an offence.  </p>
<p>If you bow to his authority and plead leniency there’s a very good chance of getting away with a caution. </p>
<p>If however you try in any way to plead your rights under the constitution to freedom of worship and freedom of movement your goose is likely cooked. </p>
<p>In a court when your word is pitched against that of the Garda, the judge has no choice but to take the word of the Garda. To do otherwise would undermine the authority of all Gardai to carry out their duties. </p>
<p>Maybe next we can round up the religious in some sort of camp to use as slave labour? Or use tanks to run over protestors and then cover it up? Just some suggestions ...</p></p>

        <p>Thank you, but we won't. Government is now topping popularity polls and you're still accused of being a tinfoil hat wearer if you publicly question or protest this overreach, even tho the vast majority of Irish people are breaking the rules. It's probably similar to Victoria and why there hasn't been a big uprising there, either. We're fucked.</p>

        <p>Geez you guys have to rise up but let me tell you, if it's like Victoria when they say 6 weeks doesn't mean lockdown will end in 6 weeks in Victoria the government said "it's only gonna be a 6 week lockdown" but he ended up repeating the 6 weeks like 4 times</p>
<p>Hopefully people will rise up if they extend it after the 6 weeks</p>

        <p>We had the same back in March/April. 2 week lockdown turned into one of Europe's longest and harshest, and in that time people created a cult of Tony Holohan (health chief who basically decides everything lately) and even painted a mural of him in a superhero costume. He's a man who tried to cover up the deaths of women from cervical cancer and treated the sufferers like shit for years, yet Irish people still don't care. It's a terrible world we live in that this is allowed to go on. </p>
<p>I'm surprised at Victoria, tho. You would think the rest of Australia would do something on your behalf.</p>

        <p>The sad thing about everyone in other states in Australia is they are literally living their lives as normal, no masks, everything is open etc.. it’s caused the majority to not know how hard it is in Victoria therefore it’s a ‘doesn’t effect me, so I don’t care’ scenario</p>

        <p>He is genuinely evil. To add insult to injury, he is the one who, for weeks, demanded the government go back into lockdown, and then he went on the telly the other night to say he doesn't care what anyone says, he'll be having a normal Christmas. He's also incapable of remaining impartial and shouldn't have ever been given the authority to advise the government when his wife is considered "at-risk".</p>

        <p>It's not a left/right issue in Europe at all. Right-wing countries such as England and Ireland are just as crazy about lockdowns and restrictions as their left-wing neighbours (I would argue MORE so considering the leftist Scandinavians are not even nearly as bad as the right-leaning countries). Even in these countries, the opposition party usually isn't saying anything against this. Leftist parties in Ireland are keeping quiet or agreeing with it, and in Denmark, the right is also in agreement with the leftist party. Only fringe parties are speaking out about this anywhere.</p>

        <p>I'm actually in the UK. I would say the actions of Ireland and Scotland have demonstrated it is a bit linked to being left wing. They are extreme. As is Victoria. In the US the democratic states are more extreme in reactions. Sweden is a bit of an outlier with a different setup so not really comparable. In authoritarian countries they have gone completely overboard, but that is expected no matter the political leaning.</p>

        <p>Ireland isn't left-wing tho. Just because American leftist states are overreacting doesn't mean the situation in Europe can be compared to American politics. Boris Johnson has lost the plot just as much as Ireland, and it's not just Sweden but Norway, Finland, Iceland, etc that are leftist and have managed to not turn into such authoritarian states (at least compared to everywhere else in Europe). It's not even remotely about left vs right.</p>

        <p>I don't fully agree. Had Labour got in we would be in full lockdown. Yes BJ has messed up. But our lockdown has not been as strict due to some conservative libertarian leanings. But maybe this is just built into British psyche and not relevant to who is in power.</p>

        <p>England's lockdown has been bizarrely strict, what? He caught COVID and became the biggest doomer going. He's the one talking about how there's never going to be the old normal. You absolutely had a full lockdown. You even have curfews which only a few European countries have, making England one of the harshest.</p>

        <p>Left right illusion is really hard to shake for some, they want to blame issues on communism or socialism or whatever when the problem is totalitarianism. Guess they want to live in Saudi Arabia because it is a conservative capitalist country right? Conservative does not equate freedom nor does “liberal”.

        <p>I heard in France you had to write down when you left  the house or something like that.  Now that, is a lockdown.</p>
<p>In California, it's just that a lot of businesses are shut down but no restrictions on freedom of movement or at least enforcement of it.</p>

        <p>are you seriously compare a fascist government to a lockdown<br>
you can still go out shopping for food even if youre a religion or race that the fascist country doesnt like<br>
you can still vote online or through mail<br>
while yes not being able to go to churches is violating freedom of religion it only does it slightly you can still believe in whatever you want only thing you cant do is make gatherings and go to church <br>
stop whining and understand that following these rules will help the lockdown end sooner</p>

<p>Thank you for your honest reply.</p>
<p>Option A is not a ton of deaths; 2/3 of the people are over 80 years of age and within a year of dying.</p>
<p>As the lockdown continues, it kills more people <em>under</em> 80 who have years of life left, as it kills them through poverty, suicide, murder (by abusive relatives) and preventable diseases.</p>

        <p>This is similar to what Gretchen Whitmer did in Michigan. If Biden is elected, this will be the case in America. Why? Is it about a virus? No, it’s about destroying the economy and people’s mental health so they can play the hero by rolling out a new system worldwide where they have even more control over people’s lives.</p>

        <p>How the fuck can this happen all over the world. I experienced a police state where I live a few months ago (we technically still are tho). They arrested me for being inside a car talking to my husband outside of my house because it wasnt "the ladies' day". Yes you heard that right. They established days in which women could go out and days in which men could go out. </p>
<p>How can we let this happen? How can we be so blind? I thought "well maybe this is happening here because I live in a third world country". This proves me wrong. It's happening in more developed socities like Australia and Europe.</p>

        <p>Freedom of religion what is that?  lol.   </p>
<p>Here in the Netherlands it is strongly recommended to not have more than 30 people at a mass.   </p>
<p>As much as i dislike the Dutch Reformed Church a big church in my village just said "well It's just a recommendation and  our church can seat 1350 people. We're gonna admit 200 people cause with that few people we basically need binoculars to see eachother. that should be fine"   </p>
<p>And they're getting roasted for it and now their pastor has to talk to the mayor and explain himself why he didn't abide by the ADVICE.   </p>
<p>I mean, I dont like that church's ideas normally, but for this i give them kudos. For fudge's safe if the church seats 1350 people normally and you admit 200 that  sounds plenty safe to me</p>

        <p>If Biden tries it I feel like it could go two ways:</p>
<p>Scenario A: Every single state reluctantly goes with it, with maybe only Florida or South Dakota being against it until Biden stomps them down with the boot of the military like the tyrant he'll be.</p>
<p>Scenario B: This effectively fractures the USA apart and causes another civil war at the very worst, or Biden allows the disgruntled states to secede from the union in order to avoid a civil war. Latter is probably not gonna happen due to Biden being a globalist so it's likely the former.</p>

<p>However, I don’t expect the common man to do all that much. It will be a test of federalism that some states will doggedly fight against and others will not is my guess.</p>

        <p>Clothes of all kinds have been deemed non-essential, so you can walk into a shop that sells both clothes and food, and the clothes section will be blocked off and the police are hanging around to make sure the shops don't sell clothes at the same time you're buying ten cakes and a bottle of vodka (you know, the real essentials). People are fuming specifically for newborns who grow out of things so fast.</p>

On another note, is Ireland rather very catholic? What’s the Pope saying about all of this?</p>

        <p>See I don't think that's a discussion worth having because that's not what's happening. You don't call a country entering a police state cause they started arresting/fining law-defiant residents, that's just basic fucking law enforcement. There's an executive bill/emergency law that has been passed and now it's being enforced. It's literally as simple as that.</p>
<p>I'd rather be patient and compliant with health experts' advice that have shown promise and progress and have 10 cookies later than be a reckless, unsympathetic idiot and have 1 cookie now :)</p>
<p>Again, don't mistake inconvenience with oppression.</p>

        <p>Lol bruh if you think mandating masks and enforcing them to protect public health and get over the pandemic is authoritarian behavior you need to go experience a country under a dictatorial regime. I'd  know cause I was raised in one. Grow the fuck up buddy. Welcome to the real world</p>

        <p>&rt;if you think this is only about masks masks masks</p>
<p>This entire sub is about coronavirus and 90% of its posts and threads are about masks. The fuck are you on about?</p>
<p>&rt;feel free to go home</p>
<p>I'm good man. Ice had my fair share of actual oppression, torture, and lawlessness. How about you trying it any to know the difference between what we're in and that?</p>
<p>&rt;Overnight everyone just voted it was a good and right way to be?</p>
<p>We were under a monarchy regime until the 1960s and even when we revolted to a democracy (it was a dictatorship since day 1 no matter what the authority will call it) the people didn't/don't understand the difference between a king and a president.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what the timeframe it is, people in my home country have been under oppressive regimes for centuries and the population is 83% uneducated, as in can't even write or read. They wouldn't know an authoritarian government if it literally hit then in the face, and I kinda mean that literally. Look up the Egyptian revolution. Many people were beating up and literally murdered by the military. The military now rules the country and people are fucking somehow fine with it and kisses their ass. Was this overnight? Absolutely not. My people have been oppressed for way too fucking long that they don't know any different and they are mostly uneducated and heavily misinformed. The ones that are educated either <strong><em>try</em></strong> to immigrate, or they are rich enough to buy their way through power.</p>
<p>Being forced to take precautions so this pandemic ie over with is not oppression :) I don't see anyone saying New Zealand or South Korea are oppressed. On the contrary, they are literally now free to do whatever the fuck they want because they have basically eliminated COVID within their borders. Are we ever gonna get to that point in the US? Probably not with the mentalities of this sub existing.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry to hear that. You could be lying but I will take that you are not.</p>
<p>Reducing everything to masks and animosity to them is childish tantrum having but the part people feel and see the most. It’s forum sliding and reduces the scope of the conversation, but it’s there. </p>
<p>So are these <em>temporary</em> measures and social changes for extraordinary circumstances then?</p>

<p>The only thing I'm honestly unsure about is that 83% figure I provided. That percentage was official by UNICEF in mid-2000s. I have no idea how much it is now.</p>
<p>&rt;So are these temporary measures and social changes for extraordinary circumstances then?</p>
<p>They are supposed to be temporary measures, but due to waaaaaay to many factors (governments taking their sweet time to act, being cocky, being incompetent, people getting fed up because it's not over yet, people getting misinformation, beautiful summer that everyone wants to enjoy, etc) has greatly attributed to these safety precautions taking place longer than they should've; cause whether we like it or not, the cases and the deaths in the US are not slowing down. Whatever we're doing is clearly not working and it's time people should start listening to what's working in other countries instead of fighting and denying the simple truths</p>
