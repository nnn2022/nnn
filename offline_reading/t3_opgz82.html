    <strong>There is nothing wrong with being vaccine hesitant.</strong>
    <p><p>I haven't gotten the vaccine. And currently I don't intend to. </p>
<p>Main reason being this: I want to KNOW how it will affect my health long term. </p>
<p>My wife and I have done our research, and neither of us our comfortable with it yet. But we remain open to it in the event some solid evidence changes our minds. </p>
<p>We have been TTC for more than a year and we would HATE for anything to make it more difficult than it has already been. </p>
<p>I have seen one <em>very</em> small study indicating that the mrna vaccine is actually beneficial to male reproduction. But I have seen way more anecdotes about how many negative effects the vaccine has had on people. </p>
<p>The science is never settled. That's the thing of the scientific method. It is never settled.</p>
<p>What's extra irritating is having people both pro and anti vaccine folks react like "why <em>wouldn't</em> you get the vaccine?" Or "why would you <em>even consider</em> getting the vaccine?"</p>
<p>We are doing what everyone should be doing. Doing our research, and making an measured, educated decision.</p></p>

        <p>I hear ya o.p. Everything is hypocritical. </p>
<p>A sentence literally contradicts the next one in a headline. There own (studies) are nothing but double talk... How can we trust anything thats clearly this dishonest?</p>
<p>Common sense will prevail!</p>

        <p>There is indeed nothing wrong. As long we can't believe the official "sources" and "$cience" best is to wait and be ready for whatever happens. I hope for my v@xxed brother and sisters that they will get nothing important, like ADE or similar.</p>
