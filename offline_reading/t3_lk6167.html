        <p>It doesn't have a 98% survival rate, though. More like 99.8%, and that's with our "very liberal" definition of what constitutes a covid death.</p>

        <p>It is very much possible for a very high percentage of Americans to get COVID if there were to be no forms of social distancing, mask wearing, quarantines, etc.</p>
<p>This is the link which explains the possible spread of covid in the simplest way</p>

<p>However, if we really want to get into the math and the nitty gritty, here it is; this link explains the rate of spread for COVID compared to multiple diseases.</p>

<p>The link above cites this source for the numbers that they presented. This is how some of the variables such as R0 were calculated.</p>

        <p>It would be a logical fallacy to say that COVID needs the ability to infect EVERY America in order for it to be a very real threat or for statistics gathered from analysis to be valid.</p>
<p>The point I am making is that COVID would undoubtedly infect a large percentage of a population if measures were not in place because of high R0 and an exponential spread pattern. Could it infect 100% of a population?  Certainly is possible. But does that even matter in the grand scheme of things? No because of the implications of having such a large percentage of the population infected.</p>

        <p>What the hell is this tripe? The irony of ridiculing us and saying we are the ones who "don't understand math and percentages, when it is your ilk you has no understanding of basic math, or we wouldn't be in this stupid mess. 1. Covid is neither the most contagious, nor deadliest disease ever. A 0.2% respiratory virus is really not that dangerous or deadly at all. In fact, that is a mild and relatively harmless virus. Hundreds of millions will get it (WHO estimates 750 million people have already gotten it) but the vast majority either have no symptoms or very mild. Only the most frail who don't have much longer to live get severe cases (those with pre-existing and serious end-stage conditions), barring the very few outliers where there's an infinitesimal chance that a healthy young person might develop a cytokine storm and die.  That's exactly how the common flu works every year, in fact the flu has a higher chance of killing healthy young people and children than covid. 2. No virus can ever infect 100% of the population...herd immunity kicks in long before that. Not even half the human population will get covid, (most likely only a fourth of the human population actually will) 3. Even if 8 million people were to die globally, that is not earth-shattering in any way at all. You do realize that over 60 million people die globally every year? Many of them from infectious diseases that are completely preventable. Many of them children and infants. 8 million people dying in a population of 8 BILLION, the vast majority of them being over 80 and thus at the end of their natural lifespan is no existential threat, and will not overwhelm hospitals or morgue workers, or funeral directors. Why do you think you never saw bodies in the street when 250,000 Americans die medical malpractice every year? Or when over 600,000 die of heart disease? Over 2.8 million people die every single year in the USA alone. Why do you think you never saw bodies lining the streets? It's called ratio and proportion...you know basic math that apparently was flushed down the toilet in this Idiocracy.</p>
<p>&rt;Could it infect 100% of a population? Certainly is possible.</p>
<p>No virus can ever infect 100% of the population...herd immunity kicks in long before that. Not even half the human population will get covid, (most likely only a fifth of the human population actually will)</p>

        <p>Thank you for a response, I appreciate it. I however did not appreciate the sentiment with which it was posted though. This is a community for open discussion and that comment came off as crass.</p>
<p>My first question would be, do you happen to know what the infection level for covid would need to be for herd immunity to be built?</p>
<p>&rt;herd immunity kicks in long before that</p>
<p>Secondly, would you happen to have a source for this claim of yours or some data?</p>
<p>&rt;Not even half the human population will get covid, (most likely only a fifth of the human population actually will).</p>
<p>Third, being completely honest I remember editing that comment from something along the lines of "Could it infect 100% of a population? it would certainly infect a very larger percentage" to "Could it infect 100% of a population? Certainly is possible."</p>
<p>I began thinking of other infectious viruses and the rhinovirus and the 1918 flu came to mind. Would covid follow a similar path? Probably not with current measures but if we were to have absolutely no measures in place as many in this sub are pushing for, then would it not be a possibility? Certainly is a question that I would love to ask an epidemiologist. It is a bit of a hypothetical so a true answer to this question is a bit hard to find.</p>
<p>But nonetheless, it doesn't not take away from the original argument which I made. Uncontrolled spread would lead to a very large percentage of a population contracting covid. I think the US is a good example to use, even if the overall infection rate was to be 70% of the US, that would mean 231,700,000 people of 331 million would contract covid.</p>
<p><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality</a></p>
<p>Using the current case - mortality rate of 1.8% as reported by John Hopkins we would see 3.85 million deaths. Of course not a perfect model, but it illustrates the point well.</p>
<p>It always helps to look at forecasts too to get an accurate sense of the current death toll.</p>

<p>You are ignoring the fact that you can do nothing to stop a highly transmissible but relatively mild virus. That is just how mild respiratory viruses are...too contagious and too high a number of asymptomatics to stop, contain, or slow in any significant way. How do you think humans have survived all those other respiratory viruses in history? By doing this in some inane and hubris-filled attempt to stop new strains of common colds and flu? Why do you think we have immune systems? How many far more dangerous pathogens has the human race survived? </p>
<p>They are able to LARP an apocalyptic plague with covid-1984 and act like they are controlling the virus with all their dystopian measures precisely because it is such a mild and low IFR virus.</p>
<p>This covid psyop needs to <em>absolutely and completely</em> be exposed, otherwise they will repeat it again with another virus in the future. Now that the gullible, moronic public believes that this whole shit show is a totally sane, normal, and effective response to a respiratory virus, then what is stopping them from doing it all over again in ten years? Nothing. In fact, the powers are now more emboldened than ever because they know how laughably easy it is to pull this bullshit off. This is why it is crucial that within the next few years, there is a total and complete public shift where it becomes mainstream consensus to understand that a. This was not a deadly virus and b. Lockdowns and the rest of the dystopian crap wreak havoc and do irreparable damage to society, while being completely useless in stopping such a virus.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00553-4#Sec6">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00553-4#Sec6</a></p>
<p>Here is a source which talks about the usefulness and accuracy of COVID modeling. It lays out many of the limitations and shortfalls of modeling in addition to explaining why modeling is important and should be one of the many tools used for public policy making.</p>

No I did not know that and I don't believe it either. It's easy to find the holes in the script. One is of you die from anything within 28 days of a + test it's CV. The truth will come out when it's too late. Sad days we in</p>

        <p>Some states it was 60 days. It's not a hole in the script. They knew absolutely nothing about the virus, and they needed all the data they could get on it. If they wanted to study cases, how else would they be able to pull the case up if it wasn't marked CV? The media did what they do best and blew it out of proportion.</p>

        <p>No, you can't argue with math. They got that right. But you can definitely argue with the methodology. You can absolutely say that dying within 28 days from positive test doesn't necessarily mean the cause of death was the covid, you can totally say that vast majority of cases go undetected while virtually all deaths are...

        <p>First off, it's not 98%, it's at least 99.7%. Also it's 99.7% of those infected (IFR), not the total population. Keep in mind not everyone will get infected.</p>

        <p>Not really. I find many of these responses comical, so it sort of makes up for having to deal with this nonsense. I mean, if a complete lockdown didn’t work, then why would that be? No human contact means no spreading of the virus, so logically, why wouldn’t it work?</p>
