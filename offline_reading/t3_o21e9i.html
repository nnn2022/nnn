    <strong>My experience travelling without a gimp mask (UK)</strong>
    <p><p>Travelled by train alone to a major city, miraculously nothing happened. I don't think my resting bitch face is that intimidating and plenty of others were maskless, so there you go. The ticket inspector was quite freindly infact. My one caveat is that I make an exception for hospitallity - a sector that has been through hell and continues to reamin under scrutiny; I don't think it is fair to potentially pick a fight with them, you may disagree, that's fine.</p>
<p>Anxiety and distress are genuine reasons listed in the exemption status, there is no need to elaborate to anyone.</p>
<p>Plus the Crown prosecution service has thrown out every single prosecution that the convid act 666 attempted to enforce:</p>

        <p>Yes! I’m in UK too and two days ago I decided to try to not wear them anymore. I went in the supermarket and there was quite a lot of people there without and then to London by public transport. Lots of people in station without and even more not wearing it properly.
It feels great and I’m going to continue.</p>
<p>I agree about hospitality as they must have to jump through all sorts of hoops just to be open and you are going out to have a nice time after all!</p>
