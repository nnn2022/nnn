    <strong>Is there any possibility things will be back to normal by August with the vaccine n shit?</strong>
    <p><p>I really want to go on a month long vacation to Italy then. I feel like I deserve it after a year of rotting inside. I'd even be willing to take the shitty goddamn vaccine if it meant I could live the life of a normal 20 year old again.</p>
<p>Am I delusional to hope travelling abroad and going to clubs and festivals will be a thing again by August? Is there any hope at all?</p></p>

        <p>I am hopeful things will be better by then. And I think there is enough reason to believe it. Sure, if things never change, no one would be surprised at this point, but I think most people don't have much more patience for all of the BS.</p>
<p>Here's my hopeful take. The most vocal people on both sides of this issue are a minority. Most people in the middle aren't passionate either way, and are just trying to "do what's right". They don't spend their time going through studies or arguing online. They wear their masks, do a lot of zoom calls, and avoid large gatherings. I personally think many of them are still playing along until there is a vaccine. I think that is the end goal for many. They need to feel like the sacrifices that were made this year weren't all for nothing, and for them, if we get a vaccine, they can say it will have been "worth it". So as the vaccines roll out, I think you will see a shift from the average people, who are already over it, but right now feel like we are so close. And i think most governors/policy makers/politicians see it that way too. They need to be able to point to an accomplishment that justifies the rules. And regardless of the effectiveness of the vaccines, I think they can use a vaccine as a positive result, and ultimately move along. And we should start seeing this happen over the next month as the vaccines are rolled out. I think things will be mostly normal by spring, and summer should be fairly normal. I hope.</p>

<p>That is really a key component that you left out. The loud crescendo of impending doom, followed by the clouds parting and rainbows and unicorns flying forth to share the good news of the Harris/Biden/Democrat lead utopia.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the informative reply. It gives me hope. The economy of a country like Italy relies heavily on tourism so I assume they wouldn't be doing well if they missed out on another summer.</p>

        <p>I'll admit, I was thinking he was in America, not Ireland. However - the rest still applies.</p>
<p>Try being a man instead of couch surfing and begging for money for a month while "finding yourself"... only to return to still having no job and living at your parents... See how being a man feels instead.</p>

        <p>Which lies? You still didn't explain anything you actually said. 
Most people pay for college if they're forced to move out from their parents' home to a different city/ state. I'm lucky enough to not have to. 
Basically no one has kids my age, especially if they're studying. 
I'm 6 years below the average age to move out, so nothing weird. </p>
<p>Like it's so obvious that all you're throwing here is just salt. You don't actually have anything objective to say, you're throwing shit around because clearly i'm in a better financial situation than you and my parents care about me more so they'd rather have me save up money for after I move out. 
Don't know if I should laugh or cry about how pathetic your salt is.</p>

<p>I plan on living with them until I finish my degree, which should be 24. If I live with them until 26 then that'll still be the average age to move out in my country. You know the meaning of average, yeah? Average is perfectly normal. It's not extraordinary. </p>

        <p>It's obvious that's what you're angry about. If we go back to the start of this salt mine, one of your earliest comments was about me wanting to admit that my parents, therefore I, am rich.
It's clear as day you're insecure about your social class/ economic status. Clearly there's some trauma you haven't dealt with. No one cares this much about what a stranger does with his money or where he gets it from, especially when that stranger is living a completely average middle-class life.</p>

<p>I don't care about you at all, or what lies you tell yourself. So that's a 10 point deduction.</p>

<p>Nope. That's another 10 point deduction.</p>

<p>Another 10 point deduction.</p>
<p>Is a 70 still a C- in Europe? Or do the statistics tell you that is actually an A-, because everyone else around you also gets Cs?</p>
<p>&rt;No one cares this much about what a stranger does with his money or where he gets it from</p>
<p>But you, of course, don't care. Only I do... Now you're down to a 60. Is that an F in Europe? Or do the statistics tell you that an F is actually a C, because everyone else around you also gets Cs?</p>
<p>&rt;especially when that stranger is living a completely average middle-class life.</p>
<p>Sucking on mom's tit and dad's dick without an ounce of remorse...</p>
<p>Have you considered that last part - the part about you being spoiled and taking advantage of your parents - that is what makes telling you that you are a spoiled brat so much fun?</p>
<p>Of course you didn't. You've spent your entire life trying to block out the concept and plan to do so for at least 4 more years... Probably more when that killer "IT, Please Reboot" job doesn't pay you enough. lol.</p>

<p>&rt;Actually, my grade system was mocking your "Everyone in Ireland lives off mum and dad's tit til 26, so there is nothing wrong with me" nonsense.</p>
<p>Comparing grades to moving out doesn't make sense. You're not a superior person for moving out earlier. In the long run it won't make a difference unless you fuck up elsewhere along the way.
And i'm 20, not 26. I have a long way to go before then. If I moved out now, i'd be much below the average age to move out where I live. 
You still haven't explained a reason for why I should move.</p>
<p>&rt;Maybe college isn't really your thing? Or it isn't doing such a good job...</p>
<p>I mean you can't even back up what you say so you resort to super funny virgin memes and sucking dad's dick. Would make me think you're in middle-school if I didn't know better that you're a grumpy old man.</p>

<p>I assure you that many 20 year olds pay for their own apartments, food, bills and don't act like college is a 4 year daycare for children. A good portion even have children of their own at age 20.</p>

And you are the type of narcissist that insists on being given more free shit than you are already given. You disgust me, and you should disgust yourself. </p>
<p>But you don't... because you are so spoiled you only care about your fun trip to Italy.</p>

<p>&rt;I assure you that many 20 year olds pay for their own apartments, food, bills and don't act like college is a 4 year daycare for children.</p>
<p>I'm in Europe. Moving out for college isn't as big a thing here as it would be in America. I am lucky enough to live right beside a university. I don't need to pay for an apartment. Like I said, i'm middle-class. The basic necessities that I need to live are provided by my parents. They would rather have me save money and have a fun youth than to pay for my dinners.
Most people don't have children by 20 either. Where I live the average age of a woman having her first child is 32.5 years. </p>

<p>LMAO. Who hurt you? You sound extremely salty and it's very obvious you feel you missed out on something. What did I say I don't appreciate? Yes, I have younger brothers. I do help out. What free shit am I asking for? The post was about me paying for my holiday to Italy.</p>
<p>How do you want me to "act like an adult"? Because it seems to me you want to go out of my way to pay for an apartment further than where I live now for absolutely no reason whatsoever?
Btw, here's another statistic for you: the average age of moving out in Ireland, a developed western European country, is 26.3.</p>
<p>So again, who hurt you in life?</p>

<p>It's funny that you feel like acting responsibly as an adult is because of pain. That you should have no expectations to act like an adult at 20... But that's because you are a spoiled brat.</p>
