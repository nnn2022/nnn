        <p>Nope, that Canmore post was the post that inspired me to contact my own city council. I am hiding my residence under a fig leaf... search the text of the article if you really want to know. :-)</p>
<p>Anyway, I thought people here would appreciate this and I'm not claiming I did it myself or anything, but it's a bit quiet here.</p>
<p>Yeah 200 emails doesn't sound like much these days. Wouldn't surprise me if they don't track the numbers accurately (cough &lt;meta COVID cough&rt;), or missed a zero or something, lol.</p>
<p>And I'm sitting here thinking: there are people who would hate me for this. It's interesting isn't it. To each their own.</p>
<p>Last night I listened to podcasts about Zen Buddhism. And they are all rather "wordly" these days. But I'd like to quote one of the ones I enjoyed. He said:</p>
<h1>We build altars to our own fear.</h1>
<p>Ta-da, case closed.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to listen to the teacher explain this, I'll find the podcast reference.</p>

        <p>Am i understanding this properly? Canmore was going to mandate masks in indoor spaces but changed their mind due to those 200 emails?</p>

        <p>No. A different city council in the province received 200 emails or calls about the mask issue, presumably on both sides of the issue -- according to the local newspaper anyway. They don't say that it swayed the council. They would never admit to being swayed by an argument because that would mean they had principles underlying policy action - IMHO.</p>
<p>The Canmore thread was my inspiration. When I saw that tiny place with no cases (or 1) implement a mask mandate, I got angry. And I got angry in time to write to my council, who happened to be voting on it soon.</p>
<p>I thought this was clear enough when I posted the newspaper article excerpt (with my first comment), but I must have failed.</p>

        <p>Ah okay, thanks for clarifying. </p>
<p>I also wrote to my councillors but never received a response. In my case the mandate still passed by a landslide sadly. I'm going to move out of town sooner or later but the way things are headed everywhere doesn't fill me with confidence that the same thing won't also happen anywhere else.  Hell, looking at other provinces, even sparsely populated places with virtually no covid, I still see similar restrictions. It's depressing. </p>
<p>It's still inspiring that there was at least one positive outcome here in your case, I hope it will lead to more likeminded action. Every bit counts.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear. Totally agree about moving to smaller places, in principle. Where I'm at, crime is getting worse, property taxes are some of the highest around (not that it affects me directly!), and city councils are more likely to be activist/liberal (is this even true? I dunno). </p>
<p>When I emailed my council I got replies (canned text) from two councilors. I wasn't sure my email would be acknowledged at all (as in your case). I don't follow local politics enough to know what the council looks like on the political spectrum. Of course Alberta votes 70% conservative in many places but in the cities, and on reddit, you would never know that.</p>
