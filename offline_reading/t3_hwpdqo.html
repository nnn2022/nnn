        <p>No. Government overreach is never a good thing temporary or not. The government has no right to demand people wear anything as long as said people are being decent and reasonable. The media is a flaming pile of garbage and has been for years. I donâ€™t even bother reading it.</p>

        <p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6fP4inlpiXFcUhmXVLLHCA?si=VMUIJBQ4QPOGTDkuyEtmsA">Richard Willet &amp; Richie Allen </a> had a very interesting conversation today touching on the psychological tactics employed by the lockdown.</p>
<p>The insistence of that phrase "new normal" is not only annoying but is trying to suggest that all of what's going on should be accepted without question. Those who query are gaslit. This leads to learned helplessness in them, alongside those who are willing to go along with the aforementioned New 'normal'. Checkmate.</p>
<p>I've got to say, as bad as this is I'm in awe of not only the audaciousness of this, but the skill with which this has been employed. It's so sick but has been so successful that it is almost commendable. This has also been discussed <a href="https://www.ukcolumn.org/ukcolumn-news/uk-column-news-22nd-july-2020">by uk column news today.</a>. It gives insight into the levels of manipulation we are at faced with.</p>

        <p>Yes, it's very impressive. There must be some real pros behind it. It's so powerful and all-dominating.</p>
<p>And sometimes I think it's gotta be in some part an emergent effect of the social media. Like these propaganda pros rang the bell and now it's ringing, and getting louder, under its own power. A feedback loop. People generating fear and eating fear at the same time.</p>
<p>And ya, I think the fear is actual thing going on here. I think that any popular memes or ideology going around is just a side effect of the fear. A rationalization of it.</p>

<p>It absolutely is.  This is the culmination of years of social media use and it has created the perfect storm of reactions.  Cancel culture, virtue signaling, online shaming, slacktivism, the need to conform, extreme polarization, etc, are all behaviors fostered on social media that have brought us into the mess.</p>

<p>At least calling it the "new normal" admits that masks, social distancing, etc. could be indefinite.</p>

        <p>Accept what?  The closing of businesses?  The bankruptcy of families?  Massive suicides?  Or the closing of hospitals which prevents people from getting the treatment that they need?</p>
<p>Would I accept the fact that the Bay Area in California is seeing more suicides than Covid deaths?  No.  I wouldn't.  Lockdown is killing way more people than Covid is.</p>

        <p>No.</p>
<p>What I wish the government would have done is continued with the message that the virus is not dangerous for most people so we should not be afraid, but elderly and those in poor health need to take precautions. And then implemented policies like Sweden had and maybe closed large events in March and April for a while. </p>
<p>Combined with tactics to shield the vulnerable, ramp up in hospital and PPE capability as well measures to help distance packed areas and increase hygeine, we would have just moved along the epidemic curve like Sweden has and been largely done with this by now.</p>
<p>Instead we went full clown world, destroyed the economy, wrecked a bunch of people's physical and mental health and dragged this whole sorry spectacle out for months longer than it should have lasted.</p>
