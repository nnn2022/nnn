    <strong>How does this work?</strong>
    <p><p>How can they allow protests to continue etc. But they make it illegal for me to meet my family in a restaurant? 
Its also advised against meeting friends and family outdoors, and its illegal if its a group of more than six. </p>
<p>I dont get that.</p></p>

        <p>I have a feeling it's made to not make sense. That way people get confused and do even less than the rules say. Many people will just not do something if they fear it could be breaking the rules. A way to get folks to just put themselves in isolation on their own in a way.</p>

        <p>It's part of the Communist playbook, and it's not supposed to make sense.</p>
<p>A Soviet dissident (Sakharov IIRC?) stated the most corrosive aspect of the Communist system was to promulgate obvious lies and illogical edits, and force the people to not only remain silent and obey, <em>but to actively enforce them on others and publicly cheer on the oppression.</em></p>
<p>This is how you destroy a people's moral compass - it is what they are doing to us right now.</p>

<p>The masks are a muzzle AND another line of division.</p>
<p>The protests are just as necessary to keep the embers burning near the wick.  It doesn't matter who wins the election, they want a bomb to go off in our collective minds.</p>
<p>Agendas are advanced when there is a percieved threat and people ask for 'those in authority' for a solution.  We are seeing this threat(problem/Hegelian dialectic) becoming manifest in real-time.  The problem will be either real or percieved violence in response to the election results.  Whether 'antifa/BLM' or 'white supremecist/anti-maskers', it doesn't matter.  There will be reported pushback from the election results.</p>
<p>The reaction will be the same as any other catastophe in the past.  Cries for 'law and order' or 'stop the danger'.  People will ask for more control.  They will ask for freedom to be taken in return for the perception of safety and security.  Benjamin Franklin said it quite well with "...(they) deserve neither and will lose both."</p>
<p>The solution will be whatever forms of the agenda(centralized control) that can be pushed through.  Whatever level of control we, as a collective, are willing to accept.  If it is the 'antifa/BLM' crowd, I would expect a new patriot-act form.  Where it will be commonplace to see military on the streets and much heavier policing.  If it is the 'white supremecist/anti-masker' crowd, I would expect more medical tyranny.  With the new medical passports, manditory vaccines, and heavier lockdowns.</p>
<p>The solution is always more centralized control.  The solution is always tyranny.</p>
<p>These will happen anyway.  the percieved problem only changes the rate at which we see them manifest in our lives.  The FEMA camps were built many years ago.  It doesn't matter which side fills them.  They were built to be filled.</p>
<p>They are our brothers and sisters.  We are all one people oppressed by the few who dictate these 'solutions' on the whole and watch us bite and slash at eachother's throats.  As long as we are percieving the threat from a lower level, we are blind to those manipulating the minds of all of us.</p>
<p>The true problem is tyranny through fear.</p>
<p>Our reaction should be righteous indignation at the prospect of limiting human experience for the sake of so-called 'safety'.</p>
<p>The solution is rejecting the authority of man in favor of freedom for the whole brotherhood of humanity.</p>
<p>If anyone has questions or wants further clarification of terms used or ideas proposed here, I will be happy to oblige or provide sources for further investigation.</p>

        <p>I searched for an hour in my history to see where I got the link from, I've read the pdf about silent weapons, the 'top secret documents', and I wonder 1. where you got them from and 2. how you can believe them in the first place.</p>
<p>At page 9 there is a 'source' referenced, some random anti-semitic book from a nobody, which was published far later than how old the documents claim to be........... (The book is published in 2007, the author (Andrew Carrington Hitchcock) was born in 1973 and the document claims to be from 1979...............) How did this not raise any suspicions?</p>
<p>So where did you get the link from? I want to call out Andrew Hitchcock himself (who probably wrote it, to get people to buy his book) for wasting my time and making such a dumb mistake.</p>
