    <strong>No more compulsory masks in shopping districts in two Dutch cities</strong>
    <p><p>https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/274903315/amsterdam-en-rotterdam-stoppen-met-experiment-mondkapjesplicht</p>
<p>So on august 5th two Dutch cities Rotterdam and Amsterdam made masks obligatory in the bigger shopping districts. If you weren’t wearing a mask there you could be fined €95. </p>
<p>Now this was a decision made by the mayors of those two cities and the Prime Minister did give the mayors of the cities some leeway to do things like this but professors of law and of constitutional law actually said this was against the Dutch Constitution specifically articles 10 and 11. </p>
<p>To add to that not long before this mask mandate in those two cities was supposed to start few people in the government who are very closely connected to managing the Covid pandemic and to the science world actually said that there is very little to no evidence that non-medical masks work at all. Thereby also saying that masks at that point would not be made compulsory. </p>
<p>But the mandate went through anyway so it wasn’t really enforced a lot and people really didn’t like it. The national news wins to those two big cities Rotterdam and Amsterdam on the day the mandate was supposed to start.  It was really funny to see on national television how much people just didn’t want to comply with the mask mandate. </p>
<p>The mayors mostly said it was to change peoples behavior because the Netherlands was apparently in a spike of coronavirus cases at the time. Probably because they realized that so shortly after people in the government had said non-medical masks don’t actually work they couldn’t get away with saying “you need to wear a mask because they work”. so they change their narrative to saying “you need to wear a mask so that people will remember that there is a virus and pulp fully change their behavior”. </p>
<p>But today The above article actually says they’re going to stop the mandate as of  The 31st of this month. Apparently business owners really protested the mandate because a lot of Dutch people simply said “ well as long as this mandate is here I am not going to go shopping in those areas”. And I myself was definitely one of those people. So for that reason the shop owners protesting it the tourists also really protested the mandate they said it make them feel unsafe and needlessly scared. </p>
<p>And as the mandate is ending some people are still going to be researching at least until September whether or not the mask mandate actually changed behavior of people who were shopping in those areas. So whether or not it made them more or less compliant with the one and a half meter distance we’re  supposed to keep. </p>
<p>All in all I’m pretty happy that this mandate is coming to an end and I might actually go back to Rotterdam now to do some shopping And to support some of the business owners there who probably haven’t seen many clients in the last few weeks.  </p>
<p>Now let’s hope the mask mandate in public transport goes away to at some point in the nearby future and then I’ll be very happy indeed.</p></p>

        <p>Great that’s those mask mandates aren’t anymore. However I still hope that the people responsible for implementing them are going to pay. Either politically or in a court of law eventually.</p>

        <p>Is this the first time a mask mandate had an end date? I can't think of anywhere else that has lifted theirs. I think Austria did at one point but quickly brought them back but maybe I'm mistaken.</p>

        <p>Well it wasn’t a very strict mask mandate to begin with. It wasn’t very strongly enforced. It didn’t really have any legal basis anyway because it went against our constitution. It was only in effect for about a month and only in a few locations. </p>
<p>I guess the government, since they already said that masks don’t actually have a lot of aeffect anyway, figured that people hate the mandates so much that it wasn’t worth it for them to keep it going. Politically speaking it was probably very bad for them. Our current Prime Minister has always advocated strongly for letting people do what they want, Which is something Dutch people really value. Having this mandate in place probably wasn’t working very well for him politically. I know his strongest opponent is really strongly against masks and fór public freedom. </p>
<p>So now we only have the mask mandate in public transport. Which I guess is fine constitutionally speaking because there’s a separate kind of law that governs public transport. </p>
<p>But these mask mandates that they are now reversing Never really had a foot to stand on. So they probably realized it was a bad idea and nixxed it</p>

        <p>Ah okay. I'm hoping at least one of the big guys with strict mask mandates follows the Netherlands. Denmark was in the same camp as you, with our own health minister saying they were useless, but our prime minister spent a few days with Merkel and came back with a "recommendation" turned mandate.</p>

        <p>All I know is that when the European Union wanted to just give a boatload of money  of coronavirus relief fund with no strings attached To southern European countries, that the Netherlands and a few Scandinavian countries like Finland and Denmark said no. And now Everyone from the other European countries hates the Netherlands. Because we were the leader of the pack. Because our Prime Minister chose to put our country first above all other countries. To not just follow what the rest of Europe does. </p>
<p>I may not be a huge fan of our Prime Minister but he has a few good ideas every once in a while. Whether or not I will vote for him in the next election I don’t know. But I don’t hate him either.</p>

        <p>That’s great! It’s nice to hear about a government willing to flex on its policies based on feedback from the real world.</p>
<p>I was in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago, while the mandate was in effect, and the vibe was still pretty chill. No outdoor masks required at all, no indoor masks except in three small tourist areas, and nobody jumping on you if you forgot to slap your mask on in those areas.</p>
