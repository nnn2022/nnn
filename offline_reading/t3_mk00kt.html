    <strong>2017 document for future "SPARS" pandemic scenario, talks about severe vaccine side effects</strong>
    <p><p>Amazing how a pandemic happened just a couple years after elites started forecasting all these pandemic scenarios.</p>
<p>https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2017/spars-pandemic-scenario.pdf</p>
<p>Page 14</p>
<p>&rt;Mild cases of the disease, which produced symptoms including cough, fever,
headaches, and malaise, were often perceived as the flu by the people who had them and consequently
often went untreated and undiagnosed by medical personnel. As a result, early case fatality estimates
were inflated. By late November, the CDC reported an initial estimated SPARS case fatality rate of
4.7% (By contrast, WHO reported that the overall case fatality rate for SARS was 14-15% and over
50% for people over the age of 64. Later in the SPARS outbreak, data that included more accurate
estimates of mild SPARS cases indicated a case fatality rate of only 0.6%).</p>
<p>&rt;Two additional features of the SPARS virus that were not appreciated at the beginning of the
pandemic, but that impacted how the outbreak played out, are also important to consider in a review of
this event. First, the virus had an extended incubation period (seven to ten days) compared to its latent
period (four to five days). Thus, infected persons could spread the virus for up to nearly a week before
showing symptoms of the disease themselves.</p>
<p>Page 66</p>
<p>&rt;As the pandemic tapered off, several influential politicians and agency representatives came under fire
for sensationalizing the severity of the event for perceived political gain. As with many public health
interventions, successful efforts to reduce the impact of the pandemic created the illusion that the event
was not nearly as serious as experts suggested it would be. President Archer’s detractors in the
Republican Party seized the opportunity to publicly disparage the President and his administration’s
response to the pandemic, urging voters to elect “a strong leader with the best interests of the
American people at heart.” A widespread social media movement led primarily by outspoken parents of
affected children, coupled with widespread distrust of “big pharma,” supported the narrative that the
development of SPARS MCMs was unnecessary and driven by a few profit-seeking individuals.
Conspiracy theories also proliferated across social media, suggesting that the virus had been purposely
created and introduced to the population by drug companies or that it had escaped from a government
lab secretly testing bioweapons.</p>
<p>Page 87</p>
<p>&rt;As time passed and more people across the United States were vaccinated, claims of
adverse side effects began to emerge. Several parents claimed that their children were experiencing
neurological symptoms similar to those seen among livestock exposed to the GMI vaccine. By May
2027, parental anxiety around this claim had intensified to the point of lawsuits. That month, a group
of parents whose children developed mental retardation as a result of encephalitis in the wake of
Corovax vaccination sued the federal government, demanding removal of the liability shield protecting
the pharmaceutical companies responsible for developing and manufacturing Corovax.</p>
<p>&rt;RECOVERY SCENARIO TIMELINE</p>
<p>&rt;2027</p>
<p>&rt;April Crowd-sourced and independent epidemiology analysis of Corovax side effects
conflicted with official federal reports. The independent analyses gained popularity in
traditional and social media due to visual presentation and interactive content.
Government attempts to respond with data and press releases largely failed.
May Reports of Corovax side effects began to gain traction. Several parents of children who
experienced neurological symptoms after receiving the vaccination sued the federal
government and CynBio. The lawsuit was dropped when they learned of compensation
funds available through the PREP Act and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation
Trust Fund.</p>
<p>&rt;November Initial reports of long-term side effects of the Corovax vaccine emerged. These reports
arose primarily from those in the initial priority (high-risk) populations and were few
in number. With little available data and numerous pre-existing conditions, initial
studies were unable to identify a statistically significant association with any long-term
effects. Claims for compensation were placed on indefinite hold until further data could
be gathered and analysis completed.</p>
<p>&rt;In response to public demand for long-term side effect compensation, the HHS
Secretary invited Congress to conduct an independent investigation of the federal
compensation process to alleviate concerns of impropriety.</p>
<p>&rt;The public and media pressured Congress to increase the funds authorized for
compensation under the PREP Act.</p></p>

        <p>I cannot. I overthink too much about the future which causes Me headache and distress. I'm far too young for all this shi, and in a way (metaphorically) before My life has started, it has ended.</p>
<p>Dad by day as we "progress" more control, more freedoms will be taken away, economy will be destroyed, more this and that and because I'm so "woke" (not the liberal woke) it's truly a disaster on My mental health by keep overthinking this shi. And sadly, even if I try not to, this keeps on bothering Me and I'm surrounded by foolish, liberal clown doomers who are as we all know just plain idiots and don't know the truth.</p>
<p>May God have Mercy. Amen.</p>

        <p>I keep thinking prion disease too. :( One thing I can't get past is those damn "spike proteins" are going to be manifested in every damn cell in the body and it will take time for them to build up. The immune systems will start reacting against the cells,at a certain point. How could they NOT. Some proteins will fold too.</p>

        <p>I believe the vaccinated could die. I am thankful I got my husband convinced NOT to take it. I don't want people to think I am crazy, but I am one of those people who has had moments of intuition and I had very disturbing dreams before Covid broke, and I dreamed all these people died around me and in the dream, I was thinking, you are disabled and sick these people were supposed to outlive you, and in the dreams there was a whole room of people who had died. I pay attention to whatever warnings the universe is going to give me. I hope I am wrong and my dreams were just some laden anxiety crap festering, but 4 weeks before Covid broke, I told husband something very bad is going to happen soon and he remembers this as well.</p>

        <p>Just watched this on AJ's show, people are going to drop like flies in the next 6 months. It will become the worst genocide in human history. I am more worried about the food supply during that time, this will completely break the supply chain operations. We need to create our own food supply management, so we don't die of starvation.</p>
