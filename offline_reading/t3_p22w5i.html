    <strong>Reddit Bans</strong>
    <p><p>It has become commonplace to be banned from a variety of unrelated subs across reddit merely for participating in this one, regardless of your activity elsewhere. </p>
<p>Regardless of the means or motivation this is a form of censorship and narrative control. </p>
<p>I suspect the purpose is to prevent as many people as possible from considerating any information or perspectives outside of the approved narrative, by filtering them out of more mainstream subs. This way, fewer people can even be exposed to alternative points of view, and the mods don't have to wait until a discussion takes place to censor it. </p>
<p>I wonder if this is a deliberate strategy from the higher ups, part of the broader censorship that has taken place across social media for the past year, or just another case of an insecure basement-dwelling dork of a mod seeking to impose their narrow minded views on as many others as possible and create standard echo chambers, as is a very common tendency among reddit mods in general. </p>
<p>What's worrying about the censorship across social media is that it is effective in keeping people ignorant, and keeping them within insular camps wherein they can be more easily manipulated. Instead of having a debate or being open minded, the debate in its entirety is side stepped, and anyone shown to be committing thought crime quickly demonized and drowned in a sea of vitriol. It's a form of ostracism designed to deter skepticism and enforce obedience. </p>
<p>Regardless of the topic, this is a disgusting tactic. I can't support or respect anyone who approves of such censorship. Anyone who doesn't want you to think for yourself isn't your friend.</p></p>

        <p>I would say it‚Äôs at least several basement dwelling dork mods. If the higher ups didn‚Äôt order it. They sure know about it, and aren‚Äôt doing anything about it.</p>

        <p>I have idea.</p>
<p>Let's make alternative subs for those, like we make one /uncensored-aww and all people that enjoyed content of /aww and wind up here on NNN, can populate the newly created /uncensored-aww and get it going and post related stuff to cute things sub as usual.</p>
<p>Same for others, /pics  to /uncensored-pics, etc.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are people who like to be mods and fight for a right cause in the same time, so what better time than now! I personally don't like to be mod, otherwise I've had jumped on it.</p>
