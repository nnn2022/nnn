<title>The Swedish death stats just came out. (As you probably know, Sweden is unique in that they did not go along with this whole lockdown and mask thing) The results : no change in the death rate. In fact it went down a smidge. So that definitively proves that. Therefore the bullshit is over!</title>

        <p>We've known this for weeks, if not months. </p>
<p>It's not making any difference. People are still afraid, and politicians still regard Sweden as having "fucked up" their response.</p>
<p>People keep throwing out these statistics for months now. "See? See! This virus isn't that deadly! Can we please have our freedoms back?" It's like people on our side are trying to bargain with the government and the masses, and it's been completely futile. Clearly, the facts and actual science do not fucking matter to these people.</p>

        <p>&rt; <strong>The Swedish death stats just came out.</strong> </p>
<p>they were openly available for months, i guess what u might be refering  to is a correction done recently and talked about here i think:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/allman-information-om-testning/felaktiga-provsvar-i-ca-3-700-covid-19-tester">https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/allman-information-om-testning/felaktiga-provsvar-i-ca-3-700-covid-19-tester</a> </p>
<p>but looking at the death rates, it was known for months, that sweden did just fine without all the criminal insanity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/allman-information-om-testning/felaktiga-provsvar-i-ca-3-700-covid-19-tester">https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/allman-information-om-testning/felaktiga-provsvar-i-ca-3-700-covid-19-tester</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa/page/page_0/">https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa/page/page_0/</a>  ( Avlidna/dag means deaths/day at bottom right)</p>
<p>in fact kenfm a very well known independant media organisation did a comparison between the german and swedish infection rates based on the death numbers converted into infection rates. (study for that linked in the article at 0.37% deathrate for infected and that was the best data at the time)</p>
<p>they normalized for the time of recording, as sweden and germany counted the dates  differently and then they went backwards the average time of first infection until death.</p>
<p>from that they have perfectly overlapping graphs meaning the increase and decrease of infections was the same between those countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://kenfm.de/standpunkte-%E2%80%A2-bundesregierung-wusste-offenbar-schon-im-maerz-dass-gefahr-uebertrieben-dargestellt-wurde/">https://kenfm.de/standpunkte-%E2%80%A2-bundesregierung-wusste-offenbar-schon-im-maerz-dass-gefahr-uebertrieben-dargestellt-wurde/</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://multipolar-magazin.de/media/pages/artikel/bundesregierung-gefahr-ubertrieben/973165469-1588694580/abb-04.jpg">https://multipolar-magazin.de/media/pages/artikel/bundesregierung-gefahr-ubertrieben/973165469-1588694580/abb-04.jpg</a>  (just the last graph comparison)</p>
<p>in case someone is getting confused here, those graphs are maxing out at 100% and are comparing how the numbers evolved, they are NOT comparing absolute numbers.</p>
<p>it is also to note, that PCR tests are completely worthless garbage in regards to identifying, if someone is infected by anything, BUT we can just throw all of those VERY VERY important points aside and can just   point to the death rate/day in sweden in may or early june and call the scam out just based on that.</p>
<p>sweden's numbers CLEARLY showed back then already, that masks, social isolation, criminal lockdown, etc...  don't matter and that we're dealing with something quite harmless AT WORST.</p>
<p>u are perfectly right, that this alone completely throws the scam over and shows clearly what a scam all of this is and that we are dealing with criminals trying to destroy the economy and remove freedoms, rather than dealing with an actual bad bad virus.</p>
<p>it is also important to note, that those criminals in government are personally responsible for all the harm to us and that they were aware or could have been aware of all of this since march at the latest! they are all responsible  and they are criminals, if they ordered slave mask mandates, lockdowns, etc...</p>
<p>so again u are correct, but it is even worse than u thought, as they and we  knew much earlier.</p>
<p>i suggest, that u keep sharing the numbers from sweden to people. (the direct numbers from the government as i linked here). those numbers are quite clear and  quite programmed people watching mainstream media all day can't go against it, because it comes directly from a government. (governments lie all the time, but out of their perspective this has high credibility).</p>
<p>oh and u can ad this article to it, when u share it with friends or other people:</p>
<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/will-deaths-of-despair-outpace-deaths-from-coronavirus/">https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/will-deaths-of-despair-outpace-deaths-from-coronavirus/</a> </p>
<p>&rt; …a 1% increase in the unemployment rate sustained over a period of six years has been associated (during the past three decades) with increases of 36,887 total deaths, including 20,240 cardiovascular deaths, 920 suicides, 648 homicides, 495 deaths from cirrhosis of the liver, 4,227 state mental hospital admissions, and 3,340 state prison admission. </p>
<p>but with higher population, that would mean today:</p>
<p>&rt; According to the U.S. Census bureau, the U.S. population was 205.1 million in 1970 and 327.2 million in 2018 — an increase in the population of 59.5%. So the actual increase in mortality caused by a 1% increase in the unemployment rate today (if it persisted for five years) might be closer to 58,834 lives lost. </p>
<p>or simply put: sweden shows, that  at worst we are dealing with a quite harmless infection, that is dealt with by doing almost nothing like sweden did, and the measures from those insane governments like usa, germany, etc... are causing massive harm and even deaths by destroying the economy and other ways.</p>

        <p>Lol I'm Swedish and literally no one uses masks. I have seen like 10 of them since the start in total. I won't deny that we do a lot on recommendations though. Many work from home and cancel trips because the government agency recommended that. Same with big events being cancelled and there being a limit at 50 people for a gathering. The agency does not recommend masks though and keep saying they don't see the point, so the population doesn't either.</p>
