    <strong>Reasons why I am not getting vaccinated against COVID-19</strong>
    <p><p>All of my family and close friends keep asking me why I don't want the vaccine.  They've all been vaccinated, except for me and my wife.  Some of them have repeatedly tried to convince me as if I'm irresponsible for declining the shot.  The below are a number of reasons why I have decided to decline the vaccine.  I would be interested to know your feedback on some of these.  If it's incorrect, feel free to comment.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<ol>
<li>COVID-19 Vaccines effect lasts 6 months. Similarly, studies have shown that individuals who have been infected with the coronavirus are unlikely to catch it again for at least another 6 months; most people won‚Äôt even get it again. So, the vaccine is pointless for individuals who already got the virus.</li>
<li>COVID-19 vaccines are 95%-100% effective in terms of severe illness and death. The COVID-19 virus has shown 98%+ of unvaccinated individuals of age 70+ have successfully recovered without hospitalization. The numbers are practically the same, so why a vaccine?</li>
<li>Over 211M doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in US between DEC2020 and APR2021. During this time, VAERS received 3,486 reports of death (0.0016%) among people who received the vaccine (Note: these casualties are still under investigation and it's still unknown whether the vaccine contributed to their deaths or if these were pure "casualties"). <br>
 Since MAR2020, the USA has had 31.8M cases of COVID-19, with 568K deaths (0.18%) related to the virus. </li>
<li>No COVID-19 vaccine have been approved by the FDA. The FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). There is a difference between ‚ÄúFDA approved‚Äù and ‚ÄúEUA‚Äù. Look it up.  The long term, pregnancy, cancer, and other side effects have not been analyzed. Pretty scary if you ask me.</li>
<li>Numerous doctors, politicians, and celebrities‚Äô videos have surfaced online showing syringes not being pressed with the substance. This creates uncertainty whether the person in the video actually got the shot or if it was propaganda.  (Note, videos where not added to the references as most are immediately removed from social media).</li>
<li>Pharmaceutical companies are protected from liability regarding the COVID-19 vaccines.</li>
<li>Individuals are still required to maintain social distance and use face masks while in public, regardless if they've had a single or two shots of the vaccine.  If government restrictions are still the same regardless of you being vaccinated or not, then why get it?</li>
<li>What's YOUR reason?</li>

        <p>These covid measures have damaged my health already through postponed medical treatment. Most people just shrug when I mention it, so I don't think they deserve that I sacrifice any more. Fuck them. </p>
<p>Also, given how easily the damage of lockdowns and other covid measures is dismissed and swept under the rug, I can't trust this vaccine to be safe either.</p>

        <p>These are all good reasons. I just want to add that it‚Äôs your body, your choice. </p>
<p>You wouldn‚Äôt shame someone for not giving a reason for not wanting to have sex, and you don‚Äôt need to give a reason for not wanting this injection. It is your body and people should respect your decision on what you do with it.</p>

        <p>You use restrictions as a reason, theoretically let‚Äôs say you had young children under one (the new variants have proven to be deadly) or your family members had young children and the restrictions lift but chance of transmission among unvaccinated people remains higher then those vaccinated, would you remain separated from your family and miss out on future holidays because possible transmission to them could be dangerous?</p>

        <p>I rechecked and those numers are correct.  Perhaps you work for the media as adding/removing 0s better fit their narrative?</p>

        <p>We at the media are flattered that you are learning from us to spin numbers but it's not our preferred view you are spinning for so.</p>
<p>Even without actually doing divisions. The "cases" are almost in the same order (100M) and the deaths are more than 2 orders apart (1K vs 100K). How can the share be the same?</p>
