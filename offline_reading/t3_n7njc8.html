        <p>I just can‚Äôt believe the amount of people on that thread who are acting like it‚Äôs almost normal and ok. One of them even said they‚Äôd have got the shot even if they‚Äôd known about the issues. Another said they‚Äôd been bleeding for 20-odd days. 20 DAYS?! I‚Äôm female and let me tell you, if I‚Äôd been bleeding that long after one dose there‚Äôs absolutely no way in HELL I‚Äôd be going back for me second. That can‚Äôt be a good sign.</p>

        <p>When you bleed heavily every other week from Nexplanon, the doctors just tell you to give your body time to get used to it. I think I gave it a year before I demanded they take it out. Felt like I bled constantly and none of it was predictable. The Dr tried numerous times to get me to just let her prescribe another med to stop the bleeding. I just wanted it out. I was taking iron pills just to be on the safe side. </p>
<p>Now it's regular, short, and light again. I regret even trying it. I won't take any prescribed bc ever again. They've given me nothing but trouble for 20 yrs.</p>

        <p>God it sounds like you‚Äôve had a terrible time. ‚òπÔ∏è I do count myself lucky that I tend not to have any issues with my birth control. But when I read those comments on the thread it sounded like those people don‚Äôt usually experience that month to month so can you imagine suddenly bleeding for that amount of time when you only usually do for a couple of days? Must be really worrying.</p>

        <p>It took me a lot of trying to find a good bc. I loved the mini pill for years and then I hit 35 and I wouldn't stop bleeding. I think it was just my aging bodyüòÜThe plus side to that are my new shorter, lighter periods. </p>
<p>My main point was that their healthcare providers are most likely telling them it's normal too since they tell women bleeding constantly from bc that it's totally fine and their body will eventually get used to itüôÑ</p>

        <p>Okay, I am very confused here, and stupid when it comes to biology. Again, I took basic human biology in HS and college so bear with me here. My understanding is that for females, and males, once you hit puberty, the Pituitary gland glands release hormones that basically regulate the respective hormones associated with both males and females; testosterone for males, estrogen for females. These hormones control the basic functions that govern adolescent growth into adults.</p>
<p>In this case, it seems to me that for the females, the vaccine (?????) is messing with the Pituitary gland, thus throwing off the menstrual cycles of women. In addition, it causing the excess of flow because this "vaccine" is being seen as a foreign substance and the body naturally is trying to flush it out. Does this make any sense? Can any females chime in here?</p>
