    <strong>Refused the vaccine, been alienated.</strong>
    <p><p>Just found out about this group, been sick and tired of being targeted by vaccine proponents everywhere, it doesnt matter if its tv, internet, family, radio, soon probably video games, or professional work places. </p>
<p>Being an 'anti vaxxer' in the Jewish circle is the equivalent of career or political suicide.</p>
<p>I first heard of covid coming back from a trip from Colombia January 2020. Started seeing signs at the Atlanta airport and researched it, found a dissident guy who ran a podcast and it seemed like no one was focused on it at that time but we gradually heard it was getting worse in China and Italy. On suggestion of close friends I ran out to get N95 masks, was hearing about food and toilet paper shortages</p>
<p>I remember being called paranoid because I initially was wearing an N95 mask and covering my eyes while I saw no one else doing so and this was February and March 2020. What is strange is many of these people who laughed it off or were initially saying keep masks for medical professionals eventually became the ones who were telling people to get the vaccine and forcing masks on others. </p>
<p>At some point after the quarantine I just stopped wearing a mask, I saw the hypocrisy of the riots and how one group of people didnt wear masks it was ok to the media, I saw Fauci the CDC and WHO contradicting themselves, I originally was into funding stem cell treatment and saw the vaccines were being funded and looking into it as an option, part of why I didnt were the pump and dump crap and PR occurring on those companies. </p>
<p>Many people, my family, friends who thought this was a joke took the vaccine, are now referring to people like me who didnt take the vaccine as part of the problem or calling me an anti vaxxer. It doesnt matter the deaths I show them, the side effects, the fact we are going back to masks, everyone is a scientist now! I am still quite confused on this radical 180. I started to get tired of the media treating everyone like they were stupid, the constant censoring on social media, suppressed, even asking questions its basically like dealing with a bunch of brainwashed communists.</p></p>

        <p>It sucks, I have friends I grew up with in highschool, highly respect them but after the elections, there was a bitterness but I think especially after the plandemic, people just changed. </p>
<p>I think some that didnt experience 2008-2009 didnt get a chance to learn from it and others made the same mistake and played right into the mainstream medias trap. When covid first hit, much of the mask police were too focused on politics and the elections, it was like that took priority over everything else.</p>
<p>I think when the lockdowns came, most didnt forsee a life that would become Venezuela/Zimbabwe 2.0 and rather than listen or sit down and think, they went into full blown panic mode or tried to exploit the situation to their benefit.</p>
<p>My personal friendships, I have friends who are on the left, and I think talking with them they still resent the society we are in now but want to believe it is the cause of "us", keeping it hidden within and taking their anger out on what is perceived to be the other. The most difficult thing in the world is to admit to being wrong or taking accountability because it would show their entire world view was wrong.</p>
<p>I feel the eternal damage that has been done, its clear from the eye contact, short communications and avoidance of discussion, the feeling of lack of respect, the virtue signaling that theres absolutely a misguided form of hatred and anger. I completely had to cut off my brother, havent talked to him in a year. Before the pandemic he blamed much of his medical issues on our lack of healthcare and claimed others compromised him. During Covid he was much more focused on the BLM/Floyd riots, I explained the concern about superspreaders and it was like the issue didnt exist but when the Jan 6th event happened everyone was on top of it. He would simply dismiss my view as misguided or that I was ignorant. </p>
<p>My own parents, my mom and stepdad (dads passed) my stepdad being more open about it but my mom has been pushing nonstop for my wife and I to get the vaccine including setting up an appointment without my input. I repeatedly told her I am not getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>I did not pick a side, I was thrown into one because I would not adapt to the other sides idea of a perfect society.</p>

        <p>It is boggling my mind how Jews, as a people, are not hyper-sensitive and skeptical of forced medical procedures.  Help me understand how you get it, but so many others that share your history have become blind to the atrocities your people have survived.</p>

        <p>It's baffling to me as well, I call it the sheep mentality like the critical thinking isnt there and what appears to be is more or less an out of touch view on the real world and how things work. </p>
<p>I can give you some stereotypical examples, when I grew up around the Chicago suburbs, the more assimilated the family, it was cliche to generally follow the trendy things that made life convenient, don't ask a lot of questions, more community than individual oriented and my dad was certainly the odd one out of the family. My dad was busy doing blue collar jobs repairing the house on his own, he did all the plumbing, soldering, computer repairs, gunsmithing etc. His brothers? Sold insurance and had no clue how to do anything on their own and always needed him to fix their stuff which over time he saw himself as being used. Much of the Jewish people we knew loved Apple MAC because it wasnt complex, they just wanted something that worked and turned on with all the security already there compared to my dads open framework custom builds.</p>
<p>The medical stuff, its too much trust with official authority, if someone wears a badge better damn well realize its for a reason, if a doctor makes a comment no matter how stupid, they earned their degree and need to be listened to and if it didnt come from an official news source then it is nonsense.</p>
<p>Of course I am speaking from my own experience and there are always exceptions to the rule, but I genuinely think the lower tier to upper middle class Jews tend to have much more trust in a convenient low effort society where everythings accomodated like a travel package. You do not see that with more recent immigrant Jews from the former soviet union or many of the mizrahi.</p>

        <p>Hi Bubonic, my dad passed away in 2003 when I was 17, if he was alive, I think he would have rejected the vaccine and viewed it as a government plot. My dad was really outside the realm of the Jewish community. He was quite into conspiracy related stuff, the paranormal and asking alot of questions. He was more into firearms, computers, photography, electronics and was constantly outside either working on his garden or bicycling the forest preserves or playing baseball.</p>
<p>My stepdad is still alive. He survived leukemia and has host versus graft disease, he did get the shot but for him, he had no immune system and I think he got J &amp; J after doctor approval. His lungs are permanently damaged similar to ARDS? but from my understanding it was due to the bone marrow transplant. I think he is exceptionally worried about the economy, he was airforce and worked on avionics, worked very hard for everything and staunch conservative and he sees how the vaccine has become politicized</p>

        <p>Thanks, yes a lot of people have a preconceived notion of what they call antivax, or they assume this stereotypical ignorant person with certain views.</p>
<p>I have very valid reasons why I wont get the vaccine, some of the major reasons are the dystopian approach and this vaccine passport. Had this not been the case, I probably would not have had such a negative view. The other issue is the emergency use by the FDA, I dont want to take something experimental and in addition the waivers that have to be signed prevent any lawsuit in the event there are side effects which to me indicates to me that there isnt much confidence from the companies manufacturing these. </p>
<p>What further reinforced my view was Dr Malones interview, Dr Faucci constantly contradicting himself multiple times in a short period and I view him as deceptive and avoiding direct questions. There are other things that casually pushed me away, the constant pressure from my mom, it started to get to a point where it was like my words went right over her head and she has way too much trust in the media yet wont hear a thing I say, its like she has to hear the same thing from her own source. My friends pressuring me asking if I have the vaccine and then the work environment there hasnt been a mandatory change but there has been pressure. Social media censorship hasnt helped either. The news has probably been a significant annoyance as well to the point I just dont watch it anymore.</p>
<p>I have a cousin who recovered from covid, actually most of our family that had it. My wifes family in Colombia though have had a harder time, she lost her uncle and her dads cousin who were apparently quite healthy so I am not sure if there is a different variant down there, other family have survived.</p>

        <p>Yep. I’ve even been vaccinated twice. When you go through boot camp they pretty much just give you all the vaccines you would normally have up to 18 years old over again. I can’t even remember how many shots it was but I do remember not having any funky side effects besides a sore arm. Short term or long term.</p>
<p>So I’m gonna go ahead and skip the one that damn near everyone complains about the various side effects of.</p>

        <p>I feel like so many people here took almost the exact same trail to get here. You're late though, lol.</p>
<p>A common theme is an ability to find real information online. I know that sounds simple but it's the truth. You have the greatest research tool at your fingertips any time you want. It's all there</p>

        <p>Truth is it doesn't matter which side of the idiot minefield you're on, people find a way to turn this into a reason to alienate you.  Our views are probably pretty wildly different, but we both deal with the same shit from people.</p>
<p>People are terrible.</p>

        <p>Been going out without a mask, if a store has a mandatory mask policy, fine thats their right. Just seeing all these folks wearing masks again it defies logic, its not going to stop the virus anyways. If I was sick or didnt feel good I would wear one to prevent spreading germs but this idea of healthy people being treated like they are sick, complete nonsense. Wife is still worried and wears a mask, my brother in law doesnt.</p>
