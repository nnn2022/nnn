    <strong>Do you realize</strong>
    <p><p>That some of you reading this will likely either end up with COVID, in the hospital, or possibly dead... because of your beliefs being displayed on this thread.</p>
<p>Even worse, you could inadvertently kill someone else because of a belief based on your own researching skills on the internet. Not in a lab, not using actual data and methods you coded yourself, but from reading articles on the internet from places that appeal to your opinion already.</p>
<p>PSA here, rain in the downvotes.</p></p>

        <p>That makes no sense. People aren't more likely to catch covid because they don't wear a mask. Masks protect others, not you.</p>
<p>Or do you think we dont wash our hands, or walk around touching everything and then licking our fingers?</p>

        <p>&rt;The kind that doesn‚Äôt work in public health or biological sciences,</p>
<p>Mate, I am a postdoc candidate in the economics-finance dept. There's really no excuse for people not having spent any time in the last 16 months to at least understand the history of mask usage. ZERO EXCUSE.</p>
<p>&rt;but who research the law and the courts... I have friends in medicine that do research these things so I generally take their positions on most subjects given they, you know, work in the medical field...</p>
<p>You can recite countless laws but can't be bothered to read a single study. I just find that supremely lazy and negligent on your part. Outsourcing information to ExPeRtS when you have a vested interest in the issue is beyond me.</p>
<p>&rt;you aren‚Äôt; as a matter of fact you‚Äôre so ignorant of your ignorance that you‚Äôd form an opinion on biological and medical matters with no background in the discipline.</p>
<p>You don't need to be a biochemist to understand biology, chemistry, virology, epidemiology, etc. If you have any semblance of intellectual curiosity in you, you would have taken at least ONE MOOC on one of the aforementioned subjects. You did not because you are lazy and would rather attack people who have bothered to fire their aluminium-free brain cells for the last 16 months. Coursera and edX are there for a reason.</p>
<p>&rt;But hey, go with Christ, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd want you to not give a flying fuck about others or do your part to ensure our society recovers from a LITERAL PLAGUE.</p>
<p>Jesus wouldn't wear a mask. Jesus wouldn't socially distance. Jesus wouldn't be a neurotic hypochondriac. Jesus wouldn't live in fear. Perhaps you should read the Bible first before making assumptions.</p>
<p>&rt;You‚Äôre the fucking Pharisees Jesus warns us of, you, you‚Äôre a drag on society and people like you have bastardized the religion so much that you literally have, for the first time in the history of the country, cause a majority to not identify with any institutionalized religion.

<p>Emotional incontinence is anathema to me. People were atheists and anti-Christian long before Jan 2020. Do yourself a favour and pick up a history book.</p>

        <p>Yeah I finished my bachelors in 2013, MA in 2020, and will be getting my JD in 2023. The BA may have been mostly memorization and regurgitation, as it should be you‚Äôre learning the basics of a large discipline... masters and beyond take and actual knowledge of the scientific method, methodological approaches to data analysis and a vast knowledge of statistics, variance, prediction, causality, correlation, and how to interpret all that in respect to the discipline you are specializing in.</p>

        <p>We live in a meritocracy, the system provides merit, it‚Äôs disgusting that you think any old Joe off the street that parrots stuff you like to hear is more credible than someone who has an education and experience in the fields you don‚Äôt have either of an education or experience in.</p>
<p>The smartest people know what they know and don‚Äôt pretend to know what they don‚Äôt. On this sub there are a ton of people with opinions that would indicate they think they know more than more knowledgeable people in that field.</p>
<p>I wouldn‚Äôt hire a plumber to suture my wounds, why would I allow a conspiracist to cloud my judgement about a subject I‚Äôve no knowledge or experience in when experts are more apt and knowledgeable on the matter I wish to obtain information about? It makes no sense, and yet here is this sub, with a bunch of people doing just that, not recognizing how idiotic and stupid they look, wondering why society is shunning them to the depths of an anonymous forum on a social media site they get to opine on without fear of associating the opinion with their person. Let‚Äôs see, do I take the opinion of someone who went to school for 12 years and studied medicine, vaccines, and biological systems or do I trust a rando on the internet posting Illuminati crap while asserting they know more than doctors.</p>
<p>You‚Äôre not special, doctors are, it‚Äôs why we listen to them and think you‚Äôre just another dumbass on the internet. I‚Äôm trying to serve a purpose, and that is to allow you to recognize that 7/10 Americans believe you are the bane of our existence, the people holding all progress back. I‚Äôm here to shun you so you recognize just how fuckin idiotic all these fallacious attempts at discrediting SCIENCE AND Scoentists are, considering you‚Äôre on the internet in the middle of the day I‚Äôd assume you have better things to do.</p>

        <p>What would it take for you to be convinced that you're wrong? </p>
<p>You want me to lick a hand rail in a hospital? I'LL FUCKING DO IT!</p>
<p>The reality is that we could never convince you otherwise. </p>
<p>Neither can thousands of epidemiologists doctors and academics. <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org">gbdeclaration.org</a> </p>
<p>We will go down the path we are currently on, no matter what. This is the sunk cost fallacy. We took the lockdown approach. It was the wrong approach. The evidence is endless. But governments can never admit that they did more harm than good during this whole ordeal.</p>

        <p>The evidence is endless? Every notable medical association stated that the GB declaration posed risks too great to attempt, that also doesn‚Äôt dictate that those same doctors feel the vaccine is a bad idea‚Äîno, most of those same doctors agree the vaccine is perfectly fine (I‚Äôd say all but I‚Äôd need to do my research and don‚Äôt have time to).</p>
<p>I mean we reopened last summer and look at what happened? I think that‚Äôs pretty explicitly showing that the ideas behind quarantine are not misplaced. All you needed to do was wear a mask and stand 6 feet away from people anyhow, it‚Äôs not like you couldn‚Äôt do things, you just couldn‚Äôt stand being slightly discomforted while the rest of us understood we all were going through this. You‚Äôre like the kid who won‚Äôt stop throwing a temper tantrum about a toy they want when their mom says they can have it if they just listen to them, you‚Äôre a child, you think you know better than people in positions that they attained through hard work and demonstrable knowledge, and that you know better. </p>
<p>You‚Äôre the idiot who says they could be passing math if they tried, but never tried and subsequently can‚Äôt recognize why no one asks them questions about math. It‚Äôs cause you‚Äôre stupid, not because you have a point.</p>

        <p>What do you think of the spin cycle being way too high for the PCR tests so they create false positives? Also no liability for the manufacturers was passed after a Covid vaccine from the 70's that had many people sue for vaccine damages. No long-term testing. Gain of function testing in Wuhan lab given green light by a company under Fauchi. False death counts from Covid especially when PCR testing comes into play, while they've made it super difficult to bring forth vaccine damage or deaths. Statistics are used to curate and obfuscate. Why trust big pharmaceutical that is suppressing any cheap already available options so they can make bank off of these experimental jabs?</p>
