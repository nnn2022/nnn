    <strong>How many of you are actually willing to defend your selves?</strong>
    <p><p>How many of you are willing to stand for your beliefs even if it meant imprisonment or execution? How many of you are willing to stay by your beliefs even if it meant you losing everyone you love( including spouses and children)? If the government kicks down your door at 4 am to detain you in a camp for being a public health risk are you prepared to defend yourself using any means necessary including lethal force? How many of you are not going to protest the injustice but whine in an echo chamber on reddit? Are you willing to do civil disobedience? What is the true extent of your ideals and what is the extent of your cowardice?</p></p>

        <p>This is the crux of the whole situation. Everyone has their own line, the point when it affects them enough... For most people, we are nowhere close to their line...</p>
<p>"First they came for the Jews
and I did not speak out
because I was not a Jew.</p>
<p>Then they came for the Communists
and I did not speak out
because I was not a Communist.</p>
<p>Then they came for the trade unionists
and I did not speak out
because I was not a trade unionist.</p>
<p>Then they came for me
and there was no one left
to speak out for me."
-Martin Niemöller</p>
<p>Not enough of us consider the underlying truth this poem tells us about human nature, or adjust its labels for modern times. It's dismissed as only relevant to Nazi Germany.</p>

        <p>I wish that staging a coup would be more viable but the majority of people are brainwashed and your insurrection would be in vain. The people who you fight for wouldn't appreciate your actions and might even despise you for it. They'll use it as ammo to crush further dissent.</p>

        <p>Sadly, you are probably right. I feel like we need more support, and bigger numbers in protests and civil disobedience. But I also know people are stupid cowards. So I have no idea how we can get anything done feasibly. It's going to be a...very bumpy ride.</p>

        <p>talk to family and community. There's a quote from somewhere that in order to get people to do something you got to win their hearts and minds. Become interested in community affairs. Sit at city/municipal council meetings. When you share your ideas u can use Socratic questioning to make them think. Do not patronize them or be condescending. Even having a beer with a neighbor and helping them out is a massive help.</p>

<p>You mean my family who thinks the virus is the most deadly thing ever, even after I've tried to convince them otherwise for months, or my neighbors who act like psychopaths who snitched on me in the past?</p>
<p>To be completely honest, I don't trust either of them, and I don't feel like there's much support in my favor around me.</p>

        <p>Its always strange to me that people would snitch to a government that does not care for them and will treat them exactly the same as the ones that they snitched on. I'm from a former soviet country and there are plenty of stories of snitches being harrased and even persecuted themselves.</p>

        <p>Let me start by saying I'm not suicidal, but, if it came down to it, yes, I'd much sooner die a free woman rather than give in to the tyranny. If I'd give in, I couldn't live with myself, and if we're never going to get society back to the "old normal" (the only true normal) and there really is no hope, (but don't worry, I am holding out hope) I can't say I'd miss this new abnormal world. Again, I'm not suicidal, but I'd do anything to keep my freedom from the tyrants. I'd fight, go to jail, anything.</p>

        <p>I just watched LOTR for the first time and seeing all these men go to battle to save middle earth really hit me hard. People like that don’t seem to exist anymore (obv I know it’s fantasy) but men used to die defending their beliefs and religion. </p>
<p>Now everywhere I look men cower in fear. They say “I hate these masks, these lockdowns are wrong” but they quietly put the mask on to go to the grocery store for fear of being told what to do or <em>gasp</em> kicked out of target. </p>
<p>Where are these brave people? </p>
<p>This is a good question to ask. At this point, force is not needed. But if and when it is, are we prepared?</p>

        <p>My grandfather told me story's of brave men from the past who would face forces much greater than them and these men won. These Brave men would fight because if they refused they met a fate much worse than getting stabbed in a battle felid. They faced shame and disownment. If you were a coward not only you were affected but your whole family. Nobody would want to do business or associate with your family due to your actions.</p>

        <p>This is the thing. There's the bystander principle, where people wait to see what others do. I don't want to victim blame, but there have been famous events where people were killed and didn't fight back because they assumed good intentions. For me, once I started seeing a hint of people put into camps, children taken and many more police around, I'd leave. Because if you leave it too long you won't be able to leave. So I know the signs and I know where I'd go. I'm in the UK, we largely have useless police and non-strict rule enforcement.</p>
