    <strong>Fake it till you make it</strong>
    <p><p>Kristian G. Anderson in January 31, 2020, in a private email to Anthony Fauci:</p>
<p>“…Eddie, Bob, Mike and myself all find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.”</p>
<p>Kristian G. Anderson as 1st author in a paper published March 17th 2020, in Nature</p>
<p>"It  is improbable that SARS-CoV-2 emerged through laboratory manipulation  of a related SARS-CoV-like coronavirus. As noted above, the RBD of  SARS-CoV-2 is optimized for binding to human ACE2 with an efficient  solution different from those previously predicted7,11. Furthermore, if  genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several  reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably  have been used19. However, the genetic data irrefutably show that  SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone20.  Instead, we propose two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin  of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic  transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic  transfer."</p>

<p>From one source it seemed he (it's a he) did full U-turn over the last weekend on January 2020.</p>
<p>The top message is dated 31 Jan which was Friday and already on Tuesday 4th Feb he declared lab origin is nonsense. How much research is possible on the three days in between including an immediate weekend?</p>
<p>I guess it is possible to change one's mind but I doubt much research could have taken place.</p></p>

<p>I wonder what changed?  </p>
<p>Was she threatened to lose her career?  Was she physically threatened?  Did she learn that her buddy Fauci would be executed if this came out publicly?  Was she afraid of starting WWIII with the truth?</p>

        <p>Peter Daszak called and asked Kristian to sign as an author a paper that Peter had already written.</p>
<p>Did Peter convince Kristian of natural origin or was some sort of coercion used?  Or did a colleague simply ask another colleague for a favor?</p>
