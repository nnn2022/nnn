        <p>https://swprs.org/face-masks-evidence/</p>
<p>&rt;* A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A large randomized controlled trial with close to 8000 participants, published in October 2020 in PLOS One, found that face masks “did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections nor against clinical respiratory infection.” <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240287">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A February 2021 review by the European CDC found no significant evidence supporting the effectiveness of non-medical and medical face masks in the community. Furthermore, the European CDC advised against the use of FFP2/N95 respirators by the general public. <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-face-masks-community-first-update.pdf">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth masks against virus infection or transmission. <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* A November 2020 Cochrane review found that face masks did not reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. <a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that cloth face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;<em> A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were </em><em>penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use.</em>* <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">Source</a></p>
<p>&rt;* An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of cloth face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. <a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591">Source</a></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>&rt;    * <strong>The WHO admitted to the BBC that its June 2020 <a href="https://swprs.org/who-mask-study-seriously-flawed/">mask policy update</a> was due not to new evidence but <a href="https://archive.ph/YVJ0Y">“political lobbying”</a></strong>: “We had been told by various sources WHO committee reviewing the evidence had not backed masks but they recommended them due to political lobbying. This point was put to WHO who did not deny.” (D. Cohen, BBC Medical Corresponent).</p>
<p>&rt;    * There is increasing evidence that the novel coronavirus is transmitted, at least in indoor settings, not only by droplets but also by smaller aerosols. However, due to their large pore size and poor fit, cloth masks cannot filter out aerosols (see <a href="https://videopress.com/v/4egEyh2b">video analysis</a>): <strong>over 90% of aerosols <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577">penetrate or bypass</a> the mask and fill a medium-sized room within minutes.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;    * During the notorious 1918 influenza pandemic, the use of cloth face masks among the general population was widespread and in some places mandatory, but they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/04/02/everyone-wore-masks-during-1918-flu-pandemic-they-were-useless/">made no difference</a>.</p>
<p>&rt;    * To date, the <strong>only randomized controlled trial (RCT) on face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting found no statistically significant benefit</strong> (see above). However, three major journals <a href="https://swprs.org/the-suppressed-danish-mask-study/">refused to publish</a> this study, delaying its publication by several months.</p>
<p>&rt;    * An analysis by the US CDC found that <strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6936a5-H.pdf#page=4">85% of people</a> infected with the new coronavirus reported wearing a mask “always” (70.6%) or “often” (14.4%)</strong>. Compared to the control group of uninfected people, always wearing a mask did not reduce the risk of infection.</p>
<p>&rt;    * <strong>German researchers found that even an N95/FFP2 mask mandate had <a href="https://twitter.com/DaFeid/status/1371448332875399168">no influence</a> on the coronavirus infection rate.</strong> Austrian researchers found that the introduction, retraction and re-introduction of a facemask mandate in Austria had no influence on the infection rate. </p>
<p>&rt;    * <strong>In the US state of Kansas, the 90 counties without mask mandates had lower coronavirus infection rates</strong> than the 15 counties with mask mandates. To hide this fact, the Kansas health department <a href="https://sentinelksmo.org/more-deception-kdhe-hid-data-to-justify-mask-mandate/">tried to manipulate</a> the official statistics and data presentation.</p>
<p>&rt;    * Contrary to common belief, studies in hospitals <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736">found that</a> the wearing of a medical mask by surgeons during operations <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493952/pdf/annrcse01509-0009.pdf">didn’t reduce</a> post-operative bacterial wound infections in patients.</p>
<p>&rt;    * German scientists found that in and on <strong>N95 (FFP2) masks</strong>, the novel coronavirus remains infectious for <a href="https://fh-muenster.de/gesundheit/forschung/forschungsprojekte/moeglichkeiten-und-grenzen-der-eigenverantwortlichen-wiederverwendung-von-ffp2-masken-im-privatgebrauch/index.php">several days</a>, <strong>much longer than on most other materials</strong>, thus <strong>significantly increasing the risk of infection</strong> by touching or reusing such masks.</p>

        <p>People who still believe masks protect people from respiratory viruses, or that “COVID-19” poses a significant threat to the vast majority of people, are in no place to comment on the intelligence of other people. “Stupidity” doesn’t even begin to describe the insanity of this anti-scientific mindset</p>
