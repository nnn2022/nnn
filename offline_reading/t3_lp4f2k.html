    <strong>I didn't wear a mask yesterday and had a great experience</strong>
    <p><p>I was walking to the elevator in my building and a couple were also waiting for the elevator. I noticed they were also not masked but sometimes people put them on before getting into the elevator. Out of respect for them I said I won't be wearing a mask, so if they are not comfortable then I can wait for the next elevator. </p>
<p>The doors open and we see someone inside with the full fuckin double mask and face shield setup. The guy waiting for the elevator looks at the person inside the elevator and tells the person we will wait for the next elevator. The doors close and he looks at me and says, "We didn't share elevators with crazy people before covid, we definitely don't now. We're not mask folk." I couldn't help but smile :)</p></p>

        <p>I work as a security guard in an office building, and sometimes employees forget to put a mask on when they come inside.  When they realize they forgot, they look at me and try to apologize, as if I'm going to yell at them.  </p>
<p>I simply tell them it's okay and that I'm not going to rat them out.  They then relax and smile.  The amount of tension generated by mask mandates is getting scary.</p>

        <p>There's this weird dichotomy when it comes to masks.</p>
<p>We're supposed to wear them out of consideration for everyone else, yes?</p>
<p>The only problem is, with signs everywhere that say they're required, it's almost like it doesn't feel like an act of consideration if it's coerced.</p>
<p>I was in a restaurant yesterday where there was a sign that said, "wear a mask unless you're eating or drinking", and I walked out right away.  </p>
<p>I want to sit and eat in a place with a friendly atmosphere and that I can casually enjoy my food, not someplace that's going to police my every moment spent there and wag their finger at me for not doing exactly what the rule is almost by Soup Nazi-level fiat, especially if I'm literally sitting nowhere close to anyone such that I would violate the precious doctrine of "social distancing".  </p>
<p><em>I'm giving you money, assholes.  I get that there's a state rule in effect, which by the way, I didn't fucking vote on.  I get that you can't do anything about that rule, but that doesn't mean  the rule is sensible or good for business.</em></p>

        <p>If people actually want to avoid a deadly virus, they need positive pressure suits.  </p>
<p>When they're working with Ebola, the don't wear a fucking paper particle mask. They don't wear a face shield. </p>
<p>They wear a hermetically sealed full body suit connected by a hose to pressurized air. </p>

        <p>I went to a ‘Winter Outdoor Sportsman’ event in my town yesterday and was pleasantly surprised to see only a handful of people wearing masks during the whole time I was there (indoor arena).  Our Governor just dumped his predecessors mask mandate, so that likely helped, although the local town still kept one in place via the county health board.  Apparently however it is not being enforced whatsoever by police and sheriff depts.  It was so refreshing to see a return to normalcy, gave me some optimism and hope for the future!</p>

        <p>I worked in a liquor store from March to July of 2020 (until my normal industry finally opened back up) and I just straight up never wore a mask. Often times people would be like "Wait do you care if I wear this in here?" And I'd just be like "No I don't care," and what got me is that the response was almost universal, some form of "Oh thank God..."</p>
<p>Some people got pissed off at me--almost always white women to be honest--and one guy even got pissed off at me and then another customer (who was also maskless) called him a pussy in retaliation to his comment, it was pretty great. Shitty job overall though, and now I definitely can't get away with not wearing a mask which sucks ass.</p>

        <p>Took my kids to the park and most of the parents and kids didn’t have a mask on. I always make myself aware of how all the adults are acting to get an idea of who I should keep an eye on in fear they will kidnap my kids. This trip I spent most of my effort watching the people in face masks because they looked the most sketchy. I get uncomfortable around people wearing masks now.</p>

        <p>Just a heads up, that creeping fear that a random human being will up and grab your children was ALSO programmed into you by the media. It's so freaking unlikely you'd have better luck nervously staring at the sky in case a stray lightning bolt were coming for you. And the people still masked a year into this thing aren't criminals either, just terminally ignorant.</p>

        <p>My mom had the same attitude. I was shopping with her in the mall about 4 ft behind her when all the sudden 2 guys walked past her picked me up and carried me for 20-30 feet then dropped me. It was the weirdest thing, I didn’t scream or fight and I don’t know why. I was around 6-7 at the time and have been told numerous times what to do in that situation and I didn’t.  I’m not the type to FREEZE when bad things are happening.  Sex trafficking is worst here than anywhere in the country, we literally saved a girl at the beach that was about to be brought into it. We approached an officer in the building next door and he said he “couldn’t do anything”.</p>
