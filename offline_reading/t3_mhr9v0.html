        <p>I went to <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html">https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html</a> and here is what I found: </p>
<p>&rt;While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. The reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. In large part, reports to VAERS are voluntary, which means they are subject to biases. This creates specific limitations on how the data can be used scientifically. Data from VAERS reports should always be interpreted with these limitations in mind. </p>
<p>After accepting the disclaimer and moving on to download the data, I was greeted with yet another disclaimer:</p>
<p>&rt;VAERS data should be used with caution as numbers and conditions do not reflect data collected during follow-up. Note that the inclusion of events in VAERS data does not imply causality. </p>
<p>So VAERS data isn't supposed to be used as determining causality between a virus and a suspected symptom. This is because they are self-reports and are not yet investigated, i.e. the death could be completely unrelated to the vaccine.</p>
<p>But I digress. I downloaded the data for 2021 and found that there were 1,958 entries that had marked died as "Y" or yes. So the number is definitely in the thousands, but that doesn't really <em>mean</em> anything because the disclaimers already told you not to focus on the deaths as the data does not imply causality.</p>
<p>So the assumption that MSM "isn't reporting on it" is false because there is nothing to report on.</p>

        <p>So you still are going with 'it's not necessarily the cause' but when a covid test is positive, it's the cause?</p>
<p>It's very carefully worded, but if you really think there is 'nothing to report on' I'm not surprised you find the data confirming what I said and disregard it anyway!</p>
<p>Why aren't the MSM reporting the thousands of deaths with the caveat 'it may not be the vaccine'?</p>
<p>I think we both know why - I certainly do, and if you're honest I'm sure you do as well</p>

        <p>They are not all 'self reports'.  Most are reported by physicians.   Especially the deaths.    A little difficult to self-report your own death. </p>
<p>Yes, there is no 'proof' the vaccine caused the effects.    There is no proof that Cipro caused my tendonitis either.   But one happened right after the other so it's damn good bet.</p>
<p>Nothing to report on though?   Really?   I get daily reports on Covid deaths in my county despite there being only about 20 for the past year.   I'd think thousands dead in the US after taking the vaccines would warrant a bit of reporting.</p>

        <p>How can it be deemed safe when there has been no long-term studies done? If you say "they been researching long and it's a lot of science involved" I'll slap you. It's clearly stated that a lot of steps has been missed in order to produce the vaccine. it DOESN'T prevent you from getting virus nor spreading it, it might have some benefit from you experiencing a more severe form of virus but young people rarely experience them regardless, so why inject it and risk it? And why if it's deemed so safe, pharma's refuse to take responsibility for any side effects? Why people are being pushed to take it and even BRIBED to? (Yes, they pay you 10€ here in Lithuania if you show proof of vaccination) 
You should start asking more rather then defending and believing everything mainstream media tells you to. Check what's caused opioid crisis in US, wasn't it healthcare with pharma's? Yeh it was. It's about money, and control, government doesn't give a shit about your health or life, if they did they would've banned cigarettes, alcohol, junk food- major contributors of serious health issues, but nope, you will get a donut if you get a jab. Fucking joke.</p>

        <p>It's sad AF but also, that woman was "eager" to take the vaccine, she was probably part of the problem.</p>
<p>IMO it will be super sad if someone is forced to take it and then die, but if you are willingly going there and taking it, I am sorry for your family, but you are reaping what you sowed.</p>

        <p>May she rest in peace.</p>
<p>Still I have to ask: Did she ask her husband what the vaccine side effects are AFTER receiving the shot and experiencing some side effects? Am I understanding that correctly?</p>

        <p>I am 100% pro vax, when my kid was young there was a problem with the distribution of polio vaccines where I lived and I had to drive 6 hours and pay cash to vaccinate him against polio.</p>
<p>Said that, wtf is going on with these vaccines against BS diseases? I have a friend that won't take an aspirin when he has a headache but he takes flu shots every year, and every year he feels sick for 1-2 days after getting the shot... meanwhile I never get any shots and the last time I had a flu was like 10 years ago... yeah it sucks to get a cold but cmon, it's better to risk it every decade than inject drugs and feel bad for 2 days every fucking year.</p>
<p>Vaccines and drugs in general are a tradeoff, they come with risks (like randomly dying 48 hours after receiving it), so you need to balance if the immunity you are supposedly getting is worth it. </p>
<p>Wtf is the point of getting vaccinated for diseases that IF you get you will at most feel a bit sick for like 2 days? </p>
<p>For some reason people think that vaccines are not drugs, they think they are a magical miracle or some shit... ffs think about the shit you are doing, vaccines are at best quite aggressive drugs.</p>
<p>If you are like 80 I think you legitimately should consider the vaccines otherwise stop and think about what you are doing... why mess with your own body if everything is going well?</p>

        <p>These people, their names should be noted down, from the school teachers, the Hollywood actors, to the goons in government pushing and mandating this toxic slush. </p>
<p>They don't need celebrating, they need calling out for what they're doing, which is committing crimes against humanity, being accessories to crimes against humanity, violating the Nuremberg Code, and violating human rights on a massive scale. I have my list and it is growing every day!</p>
<p>If God exists, and I believe He does, I hope God has a special place for these people. When the Day of Judgement comes, and He asks these people, why did you participate in the suffering, and murder of your brothers and sisters? And the moment they open their mouths, God blasts them straight to Hell.</p>
