    <strong>What is wrong with people who buy into this? Sincere Question.</strong>
    <p><p>After all we've been through...16 months of this long begrudgingly never ending dystopian nightmare we're living...they still buy in to this comedic mass marketing for the "pandemic". They still think this whole ordeal is about getting everyone vaccinated, their line of thinking is that if everyone gets 2 doses of muh <em>waxeeen</em> our government will stop playing worried mommy and return us back to normal. My doomer friends are salivating at the thought of getting privileges once they're fully vaccinated, one of them is clung to the idea that fully vaxxed people will be treated like some kind of royalty compared to everyone else. He thinks he'll get his cookie on campus this Fall because the deceptive media publishes articles like "10 things only fully vaccinated people will get to do". What's more infuriating is that when I tried to burst his bubble with the Delta Variant fear mongering and told him that his mask isn't going to come off he straight up said that he doesn't think that and that I should get better sources. Even though the media/government already said a thousand times that fully vaccinated will still be wearing masks under restrictions because of the "super deadly" Delta Scariant. I tried to burst his bubble and he almost melted, he's heavily invested in the idea he's getting a pay out after he was a good vaccinated boy for over 15 months. </p>
<p>These people tire me, I met them before all this and now even my own anti covid vaxx sister told me to "stop bitchin" about them and expect them to act and think like that (brainwashed) if I choose to continue speaking to them. My circle is shrinking to the point it's becoming a dot.</p></p>

        <p>Honestly. </p>
<p>I feel like everyone has simultaneously become stupid.  </p>
<p>Partly the news, partly social media, partly peer pressure.  </p>
<p>Like you said, I don't even know how to explain this.  Just suddenly all around us, people have completely suspended all reasonable thought, and have become complete zombies.  I don't get it.</p>

        <p>Hopefully your friend will wake up once he's told by campus security to put on a mask even though he's "fully vaccinated". You're right though, these people are fucking brainwashed.</p>

        <p>You are correct actually. Browsing through the main corona sub, and i saw mass outrage during the post about "fully vaccinated people still have to wear it according to the World Health Organization".</p>
<p>In fact, it got so bad that they even locked the thread also. You're absolutely right</p>

        <p>Think of the lightbulb conspiracy, created around 100 years ago.</p>
<p>The companies fought and fought to produce longer and longer lasting bulbs in order to make guarantees and increase sales. What is the logical conclusion? The never ending lightbulb and people buying once and never again.</p>
<p>An everlasting lightbulb would benefit 99.999999% of people while it would disadvantage 0.00000001% and a short lifespan bulb would be the opposite.</p>
<p>For the bulk of the people, short lightbulbs will cost them a few bucks per year, but for the manufacturers, it was death on one side, billions (over time) on the other.</p>
<p>So, they formed a secret (illegal) cartel and agreed to limit the lifespan of a bulb and not compete on this aspect; they could claim to have the warmest light, the best dispersing light, etc, but not the longest lasting. </p>
<p>And for 100 years, that's what we have had and what we should expect into the future. People talking about climate change, pollution, illegal business dealings, profiteering, etc and no one will say shit although this is an illegal practice that is well known.</p>
<p>Cigarette companies created the "nicotine delivery systems" which makes cigarettes super addictive, vastly increasing the number smoked by each smoker. The harm from cigarettes come from the number and the addictiveness. This is well known and is known to take 14 or so years off the smokers life. That is far more years than each covid victim and is ongoing. Has anyone tried to outlaw the nicotine delivery system?</p>
<p>What is wrong with you? Why haven't you changed the lightbulb situation or nicotine delivery system? because the structure you live in won't let you and it won't let you ignore covid. You can try, but even if you Helen Keller'd, they'd tap it into you.</p>

        <p>I can go with that. Spiritually I am having very "bad" feelings about them. It disturbs me too.  I believe in compassion for all, but they seem "different" to me. I can't talk about this except on here. When I look at them the spark is gone.</p>

        <p>I would agree perhaps they are influenced by the prince of lies aka Satan . However ,I know quite a few  genuinely saved individual who try to live authentic Christian  lives  who straight up  ran to the  Vax and support the lockdowns. I only know a smaller subset of Christians that are awake to what's going on . This has been the most puzzling thing , for me personally, throughout the entire pandemic. HOWcan people STILL believe this??</p>

        <p>Good question. </p>
<p>Many people around me who chose to take the vaccine had previously agreed with me that something is fishy surrounding covid. I was happy with that. At least they were able to acknowledge that something doesn't seem right. But  then it was followed by taking the Vax as soon as it was available and telling me that they didn't have any time to waste thinking about this stuff...since there are more pressing matters in the world.</p>
<p>Many people don't even think to question the safety and efficacy of medical products nowadays because they've been trusting their doctors to do right by them their whole lives.</p>
