    <strong>Without the media, there is no virus.</strong>
    <p><p>Let me tell you something, if the media hadn't reported on coronavirus for the past 12 months you'd have absolutely no idea that anything was even happening and your moral-spiritual compass would never have been negatively altered because what you don't know can't hurt. You'd be pondering about your existence oblivious (as you do already for the rest of disease and famine in the world) looking for something else to virtue signal about. This is not a threat to humanity. This is a threat to liberty.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Few comments accusing me of being a COVID denier, not at all. How can so many scientists be wrong? On all ends of the spectrum. What I'm against are the agendas that are presently being pushed forward by our political and economical elite in the name of COVID-19. It's in the interests of the elite to keep this pandemic pondering on.</p>
<p>Who benefits from lockdowns? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7?r=US&amp;IR=T">https://www.businessinsider.com/billionaires-net-worth-increases-coronavirus-pandemic-2020-7?r=US&amp;IR=T</a></p>
<p>Whilst you're sat at home, billionaires are out making more money. whilst you're losing out! You keep going back to these media/press companies for their fear-inducing clickbait articles to try and grasp what the latest situation is with the pandemic but whilst you're doing that, they're taking advertising revenue from your clicks. You probably wouldn't even check their website pre-pandemic. Now, because of fear, you probably check 2, 3 times a day.</p>
<p>In the UK, our chief Scientists and politicians have shares in vaccine companies. We've got the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/">Great Reset by the World Economic Forum where they consider this virus a great but short window of opportunity to reset the economy.</a> At what cost? They're not going to let this window of opportunity slip into nothingness now are they?</p></p>

        <p>None of us are responsible for killing someone via unintentional spread of a pathogen. Other people are responsible for their own lives and health and if there immunity is such that the flu kills them, that does not make potential transmitters (who most likely did not even have symptoms!) murderers.

        <p>Thank you for the understanding and empathy, I really appreciate it. However to me wearing masks represent a greater idea of loss of freedom. Besides, we’ve been wearing masks for months now and things still haven’t opened up. So what’s the point; what are we waiting for?</p>

        <p>Well I would say the point is, based on what is at the very least a substantial plurality of opinion in the scientific community, is that the masks and social distancing limit the spread of the virus. The narrative has always been to flatten the curve, to slow the spread of the disease to allow the medical infrastructure to not be overwhelmed. Whether or not you agree that it is effective in doing so, this is what a majority of experts are saying. The constitution grants governments very wide and substantial police power to infringe upon unfettered freedom in order to address public threats of health and safety. This is why things like zoning, environmental regulations, and nuisance law can exist. </p>
<p>The constitution has never provided total and unabridged freedom, it’s always been subject to the police power. If you don’t believe the scientific reasons behind social distancing and masks, that’s your opinion, but the courts apparently do think they are legitimate, and so state governments are within their constitutional limits to enact these policies.</p>

        <p>The difference is that CoVid-19 is a virus that attacks the heart, lungs, kidneys, etc. through attacking the vascular system.</p>
<p>That kind of virus is the 'worst nightmare' for doctors because it can leave lasting damage that is hard to detect.</p>
<p>Can leave... not will leave.</p>
<p>That said from what my doctor has seen and read CoVid-19 is leaving that 'lasting damage' in only barely 1 out of a thousand of those infected.</p>

        <p>650,000+ Americans die each year from heart disease. It's not due to Covid. Not even the CDC lists heart disease as a Covid symptom. That's right.  650,000 people die from heart trouble each year and that's without over-inflating the numbers like this country is going with Covid.</p>

        <p>Covid-19 is not a virus it's a set of symptoms. sars-cov-2 is the virus they refer to according to the official stand.</p>
<p>Next the virus doesn't attack the heart, lungs, kidneys. It may attack your heart, lungs and kidneys because you became free game in this life and there are many recycling mechanisms in life to take out  garbage. Without them we wouldn't exist. And there is an infinite number of viruses on the planet. They help you adapt to the environment you're in among their many uses.</p>
<p>It's the 'worst  nightmare' for doctors what kind of doctors? Those who prescribe drugs? I don't see how would you ever expect to fix a bad lifestyle or bad habits with drugs and taking advice from some who prescribe them. That's not the area where drugs and MDs excel.</p>
<p>Whether flu or covid symptoms they do cause damage to your body. But before that happens there many other problems from a lifestyle that show up, yet ignored. That's why these symptoms are not happening to everyone. Because we do things differently.</p>

        <p>It doesn't cause vascular disease, it exasperates existing vascular disease as does any other respiratory virus (or many other categories of virus) primarily by triggering a cytokine storm. You don't even need to understand the medical science, look at your own numbers and comments! Same as a regular flu, what does that tell you? In fact the numbers are similar to estimated undiagnosed vascular disease due to genetic or other factors like drug abuse. This is the tiny fraction of young 'perfectly healthy' people. They aren't healthy it is just not apparent that their bodies have internal damage. These deaths happen at a similar rate every year. Sometimes cardiac arrest that shocks everyone, sometimes flu, whatever. Of course this year it's all counted as covid. </p>
<p>The vascular disease panic is just the flavour of the month, like parkinson's was and fibro. I predict we'll get cancer at some point, probably just in time to justify the spike in cancer as covid related instead of missed screening and treatment related due to lockdowns and hysteria.</p>

        <p>Yeah, it doesn't have to be a 'global conspiracy' for the virus not to be real (or at least to be far, far less prevalent than stated.) All it has to be is a bad test that lots of people believe in -- and there's plenty of evidence that the PCR is exactly that.</p>

        <p>Based on information from CDC and WHO, they don't seem to use the antigen tests to test for current infections. What I gleaned was that because RDT tests don't register past infections, there is need for the other kind of test to gauge how much of the population have antibodies for corona. Then you can estimate different things, like the real mortality rate.</p>

<p>If you aren't reserving some part of your brain for the possibility that this is in fact nothing new at all......well I'd say you aren't skeptical enough.</p>

        <p>All that article says is that the test is in fact so good, it even detects people with low viral load.   PCR is an infallible gold standard.   Thresholds for what we consider 'contagious' might need to be tweaked, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with PCR tests.  If a PCR test detects the virus in a sample, then the virus exists in the sample.  Period.</p>
<p>Anti-gen and Anti-body tests are another story.  But PCR is fine.</p>

        <p>What about the fact it picks up other coronaviruses, has.a statistically signficant false positive rate, does not account for symptomatic or asymptomatic, and generally can only be a good predictor of the virus at the viruses initial cycles.</p>
<p>More over, it isnt the gold standard because labs test these assays at different cycles.</p>
<p>I'm not a scientist, so I might not have all my facts here be relevant to my argument. I am willing to concede I might be wrong. But what I do know is each of these problems with the PCR test on its own is enough to make cases meaningless.</p>
<p>If you want to convince some of us differently I'd welcome a reasonable minimally biased editorials and/or scientific papers.</p>

        <p>There's a pretty solid and definitive scientific consensus about how to handle a pandemic like this.</p>
<p>What's not in consensus is the best way to handle the economy in situations like this during a pandemic.  And most people arguing from your side are conflating the 2, and are turning their frustration over the economic impact into pure unadulterated willful ignorance over the science behind combating coronavirus. </p>
<p>None of these things are silver bullets or will end the pandemic but they will save lives in the meantime: Masks work. Lockdowns work. PCR works. If PCR doesn't work, you should become a lawyer... You could make soooo much money overturning decades worth of forensic evidence in criminal court trials if it's bunk.... You realize that right, smart guy?</p>
<p>All the guidelines work.  FOR FIGHTING CORONA.  Just because they may be horrible for the economy doesn't magically make them not work, no matter how much you wish that were true so this could end.</p>
<p>PCR is perfectly proficient at diagnosis and there's literally nothing anywhere that legitimately says otherwise, unless you buy into a global conspiracy so large as to be laughably rediculous.  You'd have to be on sooooo much meth to be that paranoid and believe such things. (or just that butthurt over trump losing that you're in extreme cope mode)</p>
<p>Do I even have to look at your post history to find out you are a Trump supporter or russian troll, or do you just wanna be honest about it?</p>

<p>Of course, there's also the thought that this is a test of our willingness to let go of freedoms for the sake of "safety."  Freedom is always at risk and we tend to forget that people actively want to take it away from us.</p>

        <p>It's because they can't just make it disappear. They turned the virus into a huge political event. It got so big, that it can't just go away. They dug this hole now they have to it sit in it for a while.</p>
<p>It's the same thing with all the blm shit. They used them to get Trump out of office. All the pandering, encouraging riots, bailing rioters out, etc. Now that they got what they wanted they can't just tell them to fuck off, even though we know that's what they want to do. </p>

        <p>It will “disappear”. As they line people up for vaccines, they’ll point out that “if you look around you, you’ll notice there aren’t many sick people”. And all the people glued to social media will say, “my goodness! They’re right, no one I know has Covid now”. They’ll completely forget that in their real life they hardly knew anyone sick from the virus before the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Online media traffic is up due to fear and people are visiting media/press outlets more often than they ordinarily would in order to find out the latest information. What does this mean? More advertising revenue for these outlets.</p>
<p>Who is making the most money out of lockdowns and restrictions? Corporate companies such as Amazon. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon also owns the Washington Post. As it were, are pro lockdown.</p>

        <p>Fucking hell man not everything is the United States of Murrica. The whole world is balls deep, there's no chance the agenda will change anytime soon. They'll vaccinate a bunch of people next year but they'll say even if you're vaccinated you have to wear a mask, social distance, stay home for lockdowns and self-isolate if you have any possible symptoms. We'll see another casedemic and resulting panic a year from now. The fuckery is entrenched because it plays right into the mentality they've generated over the last few years with the rise of cancel culture vs trumpism, more and more shit being done online and increasing levels of fear of going out of the house.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately there is more to it than just the election. I agree that it was used as a manufactured crisis in order to sway votes, and that it succeeded in its goal, however, globalist communists such as Klaus Schwab are using this as an opportunity to centralize for the great reset. The dangerous part is that Biden is all in on the Great Reset.</p>

        <p>"We" is the human race,  specifically the scientific community. In terms of the science, an example of a common virus that has long term effects is chicken pox. It stays in the body for a life time and commonly reemerges as the shingles virus. Im not saying panic,  but an intelligent thing to do would try to prevent yourself and others from contracting a virus that we have no long term data for. Or not,  it's your life...</p>

<p>This is simply not the case. I had some asshole in Florida a while back tell me my local hospitals were swamped. All it took was a 5-15 minute drive to find out that wasn't true, and I didn't need some dipshit who isn't even in my state to tell me that.</p>

        <p>9 months later and I only know one person, not even someone very close, who’s had it and she never went to the hospital or anything. She was sick for a week at home and then better. </p>
<p>But get this; my grandparents live in Florida and are in the highest risk age group. They also are very social and have tons of friends all in the same most at risk age group, and they also only know one person who’s had it and it was a mild case. I just recently found this out actually when I talked to them and was shocked. I was hesitant to ask them because I thought <em>for sure</em> they would’ve had friends who had passed or at least had been hospitalized, but nope. I thought all of Florida was supposed to be dead by now?</p>

        <p>I live in South Florida and only know one person who's had it. He's 74, was sick for a week and recovered. The idea that this is some kind of epicenter is a media-created fiction.</p>

        <p>I only know one person, she was healthy in her mid 50’s, was on a ventilator for 4 weeks and a total of 6 weeks in the hospital. Missed the birth of her grand baby and has to use a wheelchair to get around. Her kids had to move back in to help care for her.</p>

        <p>Social media echo chambers. Most seem to follow the same narrative, dictated by big tech.</p>
<p>This sub is an echo chamber, YouTube is an echo chamber as you're recommended things based on what you like. One of the biggest threats to our democracy is the internet and echo chambers because nobody seems to embrace alternative opinions anymore because well, the algorithms don't show you them as you're less likely to click them.</p>
<p>They should because it induces healthy debate for those that are interested.</p>

        <p>I don’t think it would be far fetched in 2021 to continue to have a serious anti-China bias particularly when Hong Kong is becoming more CCP in this process while HK refugees will have to escape and come to our doorsteps in the west and we <em>need</em> to give them the means to arrive. This is a refugee crisis I am willing to wholeheartedly back.</p>

        <p>I think I’m going to write a separate post soon. Just arrived home and had a huge argument with my dad about this. The fear mongering is out of control. He is now telling me people are being paralyzed. It’s nearly impossible to have a rational conversation with anyone that constantly has the news on. He also works in the hospital. At one point, I knew he was exaggerating numbers to try to get me on his side. He thinks everything should be shutdown and called me selfish for not thinking about the elderly lol. Oh yeah, I’m also a Trump supporter for not agreeing with the ways things have been handled.</p>

        <p>It was literally nothing, I was mildly out of breath a couple of times for a couple of days. I'm a smoker as well so could be healthier to start with, but it was fine, a cold is worse. But my taste and smell has been affected for a few months. Some things are back to normal, some things still smell weird.</p>
<p>First lockdown, definitely fair enough, it was a brand new illness. Now at this point we're just going to destroy society with further lockdowns.</p>

        <p>Before this corona panic started, there was a big panic in the city where I live about algae in the water. Apparently there are certain types that can kill if you ingest it. Well, dogs are idiots and will eat anything, so people were panicking because a couple dogs had died after jumping in algae infested water.</p>
<p>One guy I know was CONSTANTLY complaining and warning people about the algae. He was even talking about how climate change had caused it, and that soon we would be overrun with algae unless we act .. blah blah...</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, he is ALSO the most panicked over Covid and acts the shittiest toward people who show any desire at all to see their friends and family.</p>

        <p>I don’t know why this pandemic gave me a severe dislike of most dogs. Probably because their owners won’t take them out as much as they’re all cowered indoors, so the dogs lash out and bark at random strangers more when they’re walked by? I dunno.</p>

        <p>Omg how bad is wearing a mask? Y’all are so fragile. Can’t you guys go complain about a real threat, like government surveillance or corporate money in politics? IF there was a grand conspiracy it would be that this is being used to distract people from the real issues, causing infighting over petty inconveniences and have people crying about masks and restaurants being closed. And if you are still working and are crying about your personal circumstances in the pandemic you are fragile. Period. </p>
<p>If you are out of work because of the pandemic, yes politicians are absolutely screwing you by not providing sufficient financial assistance, that shit is a real issue. But mask? Restaurants? How fucking weak are you. I know you all probably don’t think  the virus is real to begin with so that means we can’t really debate, as we are at totally different factual baselines, but I’m convinced you all would take no measures even if you thought the death count real. At the very least we’ll be more prepared if a really really bad virus shows up.</p>

You’re the one who thinks there’s a grand global conspiracy to destroy people, involving at least hundreds of thousands if not millions of people hahaha. How is your life really affected right now?

        <p>I personally have it and so does my SO. My coworker also got it (she probably gave it to me) while my SO and I have mild symptoms, she is about 5 years younger and has developed severe pneumonia and is a single mother with 2 children. She cannot work and will likely spread it to her own children being she is the only caretaker. Please do not downplay this, take your precautions, be a decent human and try your best not to spread it. Wear a mask in public, don’t go to unnecessary events bc you just don’t know how this virus could effect someone else. I only got tested bc I work in an inpatient drug rehab and was abundantly cautious, but my symptoms were so mild I imagine a lot of people wouldn’t even bother with a test and mistakenly spread it to vulnerable populations. Please for the sake of others who live around us, do the right thing and just be a decent person. Has the media had a field day with it, yes. Does it make it somehow less real? No.</p>

        <p>yes I considered that. </p>
<p>but its way too convenient that just about everyone who's in opposition to the views expressed in this sub happens to have a relative who died from covid. </p>
<p>if I had the time I could find all the comments of people claiming to have a dead covid grandma and show that the amount of dead covid grandmas far outweighs the amount of actual people dead from covid. </p>
<p>again only 12000 people aged under 55 have died from covid. only 250000ish have died in a country of 330 million </p>
<p>thats directly from the cdc so how is statistically likely is it that just in this here sub two people know three people who have died from covid? </p>
<p>the math is not mathing </p>

        <p>Did you know 50 years ago women had on average five children? Their children had on average 2. So that’s the initial 5 people then we will just say they all had 2 children, now we are talking 15 people. If you add in spouses of all parties involved we are talking 30 people. Let’s take the 30 people who would know grandma on a personal level and multiply it by our number of covid deaths 250,000 we come up with 7.5 million. Which means all of these deaths personally affected roughly 7.5 million people which is approximately the population of Utah, Oklahoma and Wyoming combined. It may seem common to “run into” these people online, but the number of people who have been personally affected is probably much higher than you realized.</p>

        <p>I agree. </p>
<p>But I've yet to meet the elusive dead covid grandma in person and thus I believe it to be another case of people lying on the internet. </p>
<p>I'm serious. I ask people I meet all the time if they know someone who's died from covid. I'm imagining what you're imagining. someone must know someone who at least knows of someone dead from the covid. </p>
<p>Nope. I dont know a single person and I'm a friendly chatty type so I am just confused. </p>
<p>Where are the real life dead covid grandmas? Why do they only appear online? </p>
<p>I live in a huge state shouldn't someone know of someone, anyone, who's died from the covid? </p>
<p>And yet once again, these dead covid grandmas only make an appearance online. </p>
<p>Which begs the question... how many dead covid grandmas do you know of in real life?</p>

        <p>I unfortunately am down to one living parent the rest have passed years ago. I will say the wife of a good friend of mine just lost her grandfather after both grandparents were hospitalized after catching the disease. A coworker of mine has pneumonia after catching covid the same time as me(she is in her early 20s). Not all people die from it is something to remember as well, but getting so sick you can’t get out of bed for a month or more (my coworker) is absolutely heartbreaking considering she is a single mother and the sole provider for her household. Many states are also feeling the impact differently than other states as well. The county I live in switched to purple this week from red and it seemed like everything was just fine then boom, cases shot through the roof I ended up sick, coworkers sick and my SO is sick. So I really hope wherever you live stays relatively calm, but  now I know that just one or two infected people can start spreading it like wildfire, my work is the perfect example of this.</p>

        <p>Hospitalization rates are also incredibly low </p>
<p>I have no reason to fear a disease I have an over 99% chance of surviving. </p>
<p>People get sick. I know people are afraid to hear that. </p>
<p>This isn't typhus, bubonic plague, or ebola. It had a gigantic probability you will survive. If this was ebola levels of fatality you can rest assured I'd be in my house locked the hell down. </p>
<p>Lockdown and the horrible restrictions that are strangling the economy are not worth it. </p>

        <p>You can think whatever you want. I’m not trying to change your mind about anything, but I also definitely do not want anyone to get sick hospitalized or not. So just keep this info tucked away and hopefully you never have to deal with it or anyone you know. And if you do, it’s a lesson learned and hopefully the same mistake won’t be made twice. I wish you a healthy happy thanksgiving.</p>

        <p>Keep what info tucked away? </p>
<p>I already know the statistics. The reality is it is a highly survivable disease and almost everyone who gets it, including the elderly, will survive it. With a low amount of them being hospitalized. </p>
<p>Again. unfortunately we live a transitory life. People get sick and 100% of people born die. </p>
<p>This isn't a severe deadly illness. If it was I could see why we need these measures. </p>
<p>its 99% survivable rate for most people and that means that we are mostly going to be fine and it's unfortunate that there exists some among us that will perish but people die everyday</p>

        <p>So your argument is that people older than 55 deserve to die? And anyone that knows someone that died of Covid that doesn’t fit your ignorant and narrow understanding must just be lying or something?</p>
<p>You’re the personification of the dunning-krueger effect: someone so mind-numbingly dumb that they think they’re actually the smartest person in the world.</p>
<p>In reality, you’re just some idiot bending a conspiracy around their own cruelty and laziness. It’s clear from your comments that you acknowledge how deadly this disease is for older people, and you’ve said countless times that they have it coming.</p>

        <p>lol wow. yes my argument is people over 55 deserve to die. </p>
<p>I must be too dumb to see where I said that. </p>
<p>I'm saying the statistical impossibility of being 43 and dying from covid was already high since only 8% of people aged under 55 who contracted covid have died from it. </p>
<p>add to that the blood relation. </p>
<p>Its just extremely unlikely you or this person are telling the truth. </p>
<p>And yes the stereotypical, if you don't believe in the highly deadly pandemic with a 2% chance of dying you must be a sociopath insult rears its head again. </p>
<p>We know you people are lying about all your grandma's dying. Not all of you are lying  but seeing as how only 251,029 people have died in a country of about  330 million ... </p>
<p>there's just such a tiny chance of you actually telling the truth</p>

        <p>I'm a nurse of 30 years. Until you hold the hand of a dying child who can't see their mom or dad as they leave this earth because of the virus, and watched as multitudes more die, or had to work a 12 hour shift in a full hazmat suit, you really have no place making these remarks. Go volunteer on the front lines for a few days, then get back to me on that. 😡</p>

        <p>SO much more and so much worse. Watching people use their muscles to consciously try to breathe is heart wrenching. Where you and I breathe without much or any thought, these people are having to actually work at taking a breath. I feel so helpless. 
I can appreciate where you guys are coming from, honestly, I really can. I wish with all of my heart that it were true.

        <p>I can probably say that the number of patients in my care (that I'm aware of) who have died as a direct result of the flu is less than 10. Last night alone we ran 4 codes on Covid patients. We didn't lose all of them, but the rate of codes alone is crazy.</p>

        <p>I don’t see how the media wouldn’t talk about the hospitals randomly not having enough space for everyone. It depends how many cases your local area had/has. And it depends how prepared your hospitals were. In Germany, they invested heavily in their hospitals for yeeears, and I think they always had enough place.</p>

        <p>How do you know that the overcrowding at hospitals isn't caused by more people admitting themselves out of fear of the virus? In fact, where I live, hospitals are overcrowded year-round. Wait times for non-emergencies can sometimes exceed 10 hours. Why is this only being noticed now?</p>

        <p>Admitting themselves out of fear?? You aren’t put on an IC unit if the only symptom you have is fear. But you could make the argument that a lot of people in the hospital aren’t there because they only have covid, a lot of people are unhealthy / obese etc. But ideally you could give care to everyone, even smokers with lung cancer get treatment, right? But I certainly have less sympathy with obese people in the IC with covid.</p>

        <p>The hospitals are at around 80% capacity, which is normal for this time of year. Not all of course, but on average. Honestly this would probably have been a good time to invest in the healthcare system rather than destroy the economy and countless lives with it.</p>

        <p>It depends on your local situation. In the Netherlands were I’m from, the hospitals definitely have more people than normally around this year. But it depends, one of the only countries that’s tanking their economy with lockdowns is America. The idea of lockdowns is that you pay people to stay inside. Maybe not 100% of their normal income, but here in NL for example we pay 80% of people’s normal income. This is enough for most people to survive. But the US is one of the only places where they decided to enforce lockdowns, without paying people money??? I don’t get how they think this could work. They are literally demanding you stop your job and not get paid. Like most of the time, the situation in the US is very strange..</p>

        <p>its already been said but hospitals in the u s are pretty much always overcrowded this time of year and we have a horrible health care system in general. </p>
<p>so hospitals being over capacity is more fear mongering twisted up words. </p>
<p>now if there was a jump from the usual 100% capacity to 200, 300% capacity that would indicate a real dangerous virus. </p>
<p>again. if you have to be told people are dying but you don't see people dying... are people dying? </p>
<p>its been almost a year. I'm still looking for the elusive covid death of at least a friend if a friend</p>

        <p>Of course people are dying?? And it’s not totally fair to look at the statistics and compare them to the normal numbers because our society isn’t the same as normal. Because of the extreme measurements we’ve taken, the R (reproduction rate) is far lower than normally. A flu can be bad, but it’s mostly the elderly that get serious problems. Covid-19 is worse, most people don’t have any antibodies against corona viruses. So although the death rate amongst healthy young people is very low, the hospitalization rate is far higher than a bad flu. If COVID-19 is uncontrollably spreading, the R is way higher than the flu, because almost nobody is already immune. </p>
<p>If we didn’t have any restrictions, it would be very likely that around 50-60% of the population would get covid in a relatively short period of time. That would mean the hospitals would be WAY over capacity.</p>
<p>For example the NL. If 50% of the people got covid, that’s 8.5 million people sick. 14% will be so sick they need to go to the hospital, that’s 1.19 million. And around 6% need to go to the ICU. That’s 551.000 people that need an IC bed. We only have 1150 IC beds! Even if you spread it over a few months, it’s not going to be enough. And even if you hypothetically say all those people could get hospitalization, we still have a loooot of dead people. The WHO said the death rate was 3,4%, which seems a little high, in South Korea its 0.5% for example. So if we take 0.5%, that’s 42.000 people dead. That’s 4 times as much as in 2018. And that’s without the people dying because they can’t get hospitalization.</p>
