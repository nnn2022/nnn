    <strong>Attention, questioning Doomers looking for absolution from NNN Free Thinkers:</strong>
    <p><p>We understand that it is painful to abandon the pearls you have clutched for the past year.  </p>
<p>Your existence took on new meaning and importance as you nobly followed the science.  You hung on every word from Dr. Fauci with rapt attention, as he gave his sage predictions during morning news show appearances.  You thought he was kind of handsome, in an impish, albeit slightly short and  pipsqueakish Lucky Charms way.  You fawned over Dr. Birx’s stylish Task Force scarves, and viewed her as the perfect foil for the Orange Man.  </p>
<p>As the science evolved, you understood innately that our countermeasures had to keep pace.  This was an unprecedented pandemic, with a flexible viral enemy, after all.  The virus was far more clever than any we had faced before.  In the airport terminal, it was important to stand on the circles 6’ apart, but on the airplane, when 6” away from the passenger next to you, you felt safe removing your mask to have a free ginger ale and bag of pretzels during the most deadly pandemic in human history.  WalMart was inherently safe, but classrooms and churches weren’t.  Science and politicians said so.</p>
<p>You did your moral duty, policing the local Home Depot and Publix for the maskless, or those that dared not follow the aisle arrows and distance circles, bravely delivering devastating side-eyes and almost audible disdain with your exasperation.</p>
<p>The most courageous among you confronted we heretics with your mobile devices, promising to make us modern-day social media Hester Prynnes, by posting our grandma-killing antics online.</p>
<p>Your minds were able to reconcile that “cases” used to mean sick people, but now meant asymptomatic “positive tests” with the following trace, contact and isolate gymnastics.  </p>
<p>You were certain that the non-pharmaceutical interventions (draconian business- and life-destroying lockdowns, antisocial distancing, and dehumanizing masks) were for the greater good, and didn’t have any consequences that could outweigh saving just one life.</p>
<p>You were the parents we saw on an outdoor park trail, making their kids wear masks, or keeping them inside and having twisted, sad “play dates” over Zoom.  </p>
<p>Now, here you are at NNN.  We’ve seen so many posts from those that have begun to realize they have been duped.  There are cracks in your worldview.  It’s just not adding up.  Bodies are not stacked like cordwood like they are supposed to be.  Governor Cuomo no longer seems like the COVID hero he was.  Despite masks and double masks, and more lockdowns, the virus is following a seasonal pattern.  So, you have questions, and come here.  </p>
<p>Maybe you were a mask enforcer Commandant, reveling in your once-in-a-lifetime ability to exercise power and control over another person.  Maybe you were a moral online busybody, shilling on any site that dared question the COVID orthodoxy.  Or perhaps you were just sheltering in your basement, demanding that your mom make you more chicken tenders.  </p>
<p>No matter, you are here now.  But instead of admitting you were misled, you give a convoluted story about how you somehow always knew it was really bullshit, but something something couldn’t express that, or were initially afraid, but not anymore, or whatever.  And now you want to join us.</p>
<p>Listen to me carefully.  Screw you, forever, you mentally weak piece of shit.  You put our society through hell with your lemming-like and virtue-signaling behavior.  Old people in assisted living facilities, young children, and small business owners suffered incredible devastation from your collective psychosis.  They were abandoned to die alone, or to miss school and be emotionally warped for life, because of your inability to think for yourself.  Small businesses were decimated in favor of global conglomerates.  So much collateral damage.  It will take decades to undo it all. </p>
<p>You were fully complicit.  Now you want to come here?  Ask us to absolve you of your guilt and crimes?  No way.  No quarter.  There will be a reckoning.  We know who you are.  We won’t forget.  Just like the French women who slept with the occupying Nazis, you will have your head figuratively shaved at some point.  </p>
<p>Stop coming here with your questions and sob stories.  You will not find absolution on NNN.</p></p>

        <p>I am really frustrated with these people, but we must strike a balance. We can't just forgive and forget, but if they are willing to help us it might not be best to shut them out.</p>

        <p>It just confuses me because I can listen to Dr. Fauci and other entertainers like Bill Gates. I can read peer reviewed medical journals citing WHO, CDC, NEJM, BMJ, JAMA. I can read all the Covid ICD codes and Contact Tracing Protocols. I've watched dozens of hour long seminars about Covid testing (Labroots for PACE credits) and I still think that Covid is an inflated plandemic.</p>
<p><em>In fact reading journals and watching those medical webinars solidified the FACT that there is ZERO burden of proof to declare a Covid Case per the coding itself. Therefore they can literally be invented in the doctor's office or through contact tracing without testing or even ignoring a negative test...</em></p>
<p>The ones claiming "trust the science" are hyperfocused on false framed media stories not based in any sort of science and are enabling the unjust restrictions which have far more detrimental effects.</p>
