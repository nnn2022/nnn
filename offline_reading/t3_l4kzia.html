        <p>It's a big scam, owned by a former Goldman Sacs officer.  Made to shake down small business owners.<br>
     Made to make small and moderate businessman come into a compliance that is not mandated anywhere but in a public opinion campaign.  Businesses will suffer because people will be looking for a stupid seal that two weeks ago did not matter.  The guy behind this is a billionaire,  and Spike Lee and the Hollywood ass hats don't need anymore money or ego boosting.</p>

        <p>Seems like a scam. These ads are giving me a creepy feeling. As seen in healthcare accreditation takes on a life of its own, comes at a high cost, and does not assure anything except a make middle man making money. Any business could meet the standards independently without the accreditation. The public needs to know this.  They are obviously spending a lot of money on advertising which means they see themselves making a lot of money back. Businesses can be safe without having this accreditation and this will send us mixed message to the public. I wish these celebrities would take more accountability and put more thought into what they are putting out. Unfortunately the public will be swayed by big name celebrities supporting this money making business venture. This also could be devastating for businesses who cannot afford the high price of the seal for safety.</p>
