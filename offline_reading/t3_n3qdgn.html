    <strong>The Fate of Doomers is Only To Be Lab Rats and Obedient Slaves to Their Master Fauci and the Government.</strong>
    <p><p>Ahh, after observing many of you irl and on reddit, all of you are the same. Lazy, unambitious and who had no lives prior to covid. You fools only find virtue and happiness in being lab rats to test whatever your Master, who is the government and fauci commands you to. You doomers love virtue signaling us if we protest or don't mask, yet, you all are sitting in your homes hoping this covid nonsense doesn't end. Why? Because you love those petty government checks and you don't want to go back to your old miserable fucking lives. It makes you feel good huh seeing all of us locked up in our homes and in misery? You blind idiots do not see the economic destruction that is here, and more restrictions that are coming. You fuckers only love getting fucked in the ass hard by your Master. You are their little free use rag dolls.</p>
<p>You socialists/communists are the lowest of the low and most clownest out of all. You have gave up your freedoms, basic rights and honor for a fucking disease which has a 99.7% survival rate. Are you that dumb to give up everything for this? Masks don't do shit (many studies have been done on this) and social distancing is dividing Us more than ever, and people literally fear each other now. If I was to social distance Myself from anyone, that would be from you worthless doomers. </p>
<p>You conveniently overlook suicides, people being denied medical treatment in favor/fear of Covid, victims being locked up with their abusers, small businesses going under, government's growing tyranny with power and blatantly flaunting their own rules, your friends and families collective-mental health plummeting, children's education and development suffering, and the figures and statistics from States like Florida and Texas which have gone down, in your , borderline psychopathic endorsement of lockdowns and face masks. </p>
<p>You Doomer's only ambition in life is to obey, bow down and be a slave to the government and to add the cherry on top, you will quad mask to please your Masters even more. And oh, also, to be their lab rats to test this experimental vaccine for them, not knowing the long term side effects of it. And, for the ones who obediently took the vaccine and still are double masking and social distancing, WTF. How fucking stupid you have to be to do that? And yet, you still virtue signal us while you are making fool of yourselves. Your Master Fauci and his crew are laughing their asses off rn looking at you and I bet it's hard for even them to believe, how easy it is to brainwash and manipulate this clown society for their own gain and benefit.</p>
<p>And for the people on this Sub, we didn't come into this world to be fucking lab rats. Fuck that. We came here for a purpose which is to do whatever the hell we want to do, and have freedom in this so called "free" country who promised us our basic freedoms. There is no high in living just a boring and simple life and submitting to the government which y'all love to do. Rather, life is a wonderful adventure and no 1 should be able to stop us. I personally like to live My life on the edge, and Idgaf about death and love to take all the risks. Time is very limited here and life is very short and we must make the most of it and do whatever we want in this limited time. No fucking 1 should be able to take our basic rights away. Fuck them. And you doomers, go back to your old miserable lives, who's only source of happiness is by telling others to quad mask.</p></p>

        <p>I do think u can better look for Klaus Schwab. Fauci is just a puppet. Just like in the Netherlands we have Hugo de Jonge and Mark Rutte, these are just puppets rolling out a agenda</p>

        <p>I understand where you're coming from, but the doomers are brainwashed and afraid. And our right to do "whatever the hell we want to do" ends where it hurts others. Just as they have no right to hurt us with all their support of the harmful lockdowns and medical experimentation. My right to swing my fist ends where your face starts kind of thing.</p>
<p>Me living my life free of medical devices is a basic freedom. Them choosing to wear masks or take shots is their basic freedom.</p>
<p>I truly understand your anger! Contrary to all logic, doomers think that we will harm them by breathing and existing. Logically if they mask and take shots they should believe they are now safe from our plague rat selves. Like you I'm horrified by all the mental illness being displayed by doomers this past 400 days but that's a sign they need our care, not our hate.</p>
<p>If we hate on them we're playing right into the globalists' hands. The globalists are trying to divide and conquer us. Please don't help them.</p>
