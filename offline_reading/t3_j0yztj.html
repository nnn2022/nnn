    <strong>Anyone operating from the standpoint that the science doesn't even matter at this point?</strong>
    <p><p>I know I've had complete go nowhere conversations with people arguing the science about covid but when I think about it that is starting from their frame which is a wrong way to go about it. They're assumption is that IF the virus is as deadly as they say it is it is ok to implement tyranical law.</p>
<p>Even if you were to seed the ground to them that all their science is correct, that masks work and lockdowns slow the spread you're still infringing on peoples fundamental rights and freedoms which is wrong and should never be the case in a free democracy.</p></p>

        <p>There was a local feel-good story about a 10 year old was just released from like 2 months in the hospital, on a vent, the works.  I was happy for the kid...there was a photo of her, she looked to be about 160-180 lbs, at 10 years old - morbidly obese.  The parents were quoted saying "it could happen to anybody".  Which is true but it's a lot less likely if your children are not morbidly obese.  Obesity, T2 Diabetes and heart disease in kids is OK but NOT Covid.  Science doesn't matter and neither does it's cousin, common sense.</p>

        <p>More likely with influenza for children who are healthy and not obese. This "it could happen to anyone" fearmongering is irrational. Anyone could be bitten by a shark in the ocean but that's extremely rare and doesn't stop us swimming in the ocean. Anyone could die or be critically injured any time they get in a car, and it's far more likely to happen to a 10 year old than getting seriously ill from covid. Anyone could be hit by lighting.... not likely though.</p>

        <p>Science does matter. The problem is shit like this <a href="https://media.gatesnotes.com/-/media/Images/Articles/About-Bill-Gates/Summer-Books-2015/summer-books_2015_1200px_v1.ashx">picture of Bill Gates posing happily with a stack of books. The top being, How to Lie With Statistics</a>. You could claim well, the book teaches you how to SPOT those lying with statistics. But we see all the time where data is skewed to fit a narrative and those of us that haven’t made science our lives can be easily misled. </p>
<p>The problem isn’t science, it’s those that use it to lie. And it’s those that we should be able to trust, that state easily provable facts wrongly before testing it. How can you not know how effective mask are and release the wrong info as Fauci did in the beginning? That’s something that could have been tested and shouldn’t have been up for debate. If you take the position that he was trying to preserve mask, that’s still him lying to us and “putting us in danger”. </p>
<p>Also that asymptomatic folks were at first the reason for the majority of the spread, and then that asymptomatic carriers are not contagious. Why are you releasing things wrong when you could study it first?</p>
<p>Trust is the issue here, and you can’t trust anyone.</p>

        <p>While i wholeheartedly agree with the core sentiment of lying with true data, i have to disagree on one important thing:</p>
<p>Properly Studying and publishing those results take time.  A lot of it.  I was shocked how fast we had the first informations of corona in (not completely sure,  but i think it was)  nature,  like 2 weeks after it getting out of china.<br>
Normally papers wait months to go from first manuscript to published (sometimes up to a year).  </p>
<p>The need to get the information out and into the public shortcut a lot of the traditional process, which also means you will find a lot more bad to wrong data,  which  was quickly acquired to ride the corona hype to a publication. </p>
<p>Are you ready to do things like a quarantining for 14 days,  if everybody says "we dont know if that is good,  the study should be published in ~4 or so months"  we have to go by best available knowledge.</p>
<p>One simple way to go about most statistics you are given is to be precise.  Look exactly at the axis and numbers,  not only the graph. Look at the circumstances and exact things tested as often those results get extrapolated into territory that you just can't do.  Good example is "xyz can kill cancer,  researchers found!"  when a damn handgun can kill cancer cells in a petri dish.  That is why a lot of the surprising super cures apparently vanish,  because in practice they don't work.</p>

        <p>There’s a difference between not showing symptoms yet and being asymptomatic. People spreading the disease not knowing they have it  due to not showing symptoms until being infected for up to 2 week are still the major transmitters.</p>

        <p>I’ve started to get annoyed any time someone brings up “the science” when it comes to any of this.  Science is a process.  Are we supposed to just wait in limbo until the modern priests Fauci et al give us their blessing to get back to normal?  It’s entirely possible (probable, even) that eventually “the science” is going to conclude that this virus isn’t anywhere near as dangerous as first thought and that none of this was necessary.  Of course, all the fearful lemmings will take pride in “trusting the science”.</p>
<p>&rt;still infringing on peoples fundamental rights and freedoms</p>
<p>These people don’t care.  They want a society that is safe, not free.  They’re afraid of their own shadows.</p>

        <p>Yes science evolves as we learn more. What makes you think you (not a physician I assume?) know more than people who have studied science &amp; medicine &amp; had years of practice seeing illness in real life? </p>
<p>Real question.  I’m guessing people hear bits they like &amp; cling to them and gather their info from Facebook &amp; Reddit &amp; consider themselves informed. Happy to be wrong &amp; there’s another reason?</p>

        <p>"We are all equals in science." No. Did you do a 4 year undergraduate degree (being taught basic science, research skills, how to read and analyze scholarly articles, and critical thinking), most likely research or internship experience throughout, at least 4 years in graduate school or medschool, and an additional couple years of postdoc residency/internships? Highly doubt it.</p>
<p>They have 10+ years studying science and research, meanwhile you think you can look up articles for maybe a few hours total (if that) and consider that equal?</p>

        <p>Think what you like. I can still find faulty logic, lazy assumptions, mistaken causation from correlation, misrepresentation through statistics and closed mind refusal to accept other views. Scientists (those who love to call themselves that) are actually rather stupid. Academic knowledge must be tempered with common sense and especially public policy with covid-19. Science is flawed through confirmation bias, the need for approval in the specialised community and above all, a preference for paying grants.</p>

<p>Copernicus was controversial because.... Wait for it... Nobody believed the science... Kind of like anti-maskers? Plus he knew exactly how pissed the religious community would be when he said the earth wasn't the center of the universe but he said it anyway, because it was the uncomfortable truth.</p>

        <p>&rt;What is science? Its just the current officially condoned understanding</p>
<p>Agreed.</p>
<p>&rt;People were wrong about astronomy, germs, climate change</p>
<p>Gravity is still only a theory right?</p>
<p>Terrible comparison, astronomy and germs were debates in medieval times where world governments were dominated by anti science religious monarchies. In modern times it is much easier to come to an evidence based, factual, easily accessible conclusion, like with climate change. Scientists remain evil only to those whose mindsets never left the medieval era.</p>
<p>&rt;A skill is measurable.</p>
<p>As is expertise, something climate scientists and virologists have in their domains and you do not.</p>
<p>Luckily they write, publish and peer review papers for laymen like you and me to read.</p>

        <p>One thing...  Peer reviewed papers in some disciplines are definetely not something a laymen can read and understand.  </p>
<p>Maybe in the future science communication will evolve and get better,  but as of current, papers are done for the people in the field,  even people in  adjacent specializations (who then peer review it)  have sometimes not a good clue what they are writing about.</p>

<p>Fair point, but many are specifically written for certain groups of people, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/">like the IPCC's summary for policy makers.</a></p>
<p>&rt;even people in adjacent specializations (who then peer review it) have sometimes not a good clue what they are writing about.</p>
<p>I highly doubt people in the same field but a different specialization would be completely lost reading a peers report - I also doubt a urologist would request a thoracic surgeon to peer review their paper since these are wildly different topics of expertise despite technically being in the same 'medical' field.</p>
<p>Climate papers are peer reviewed by other climatologists, covid papers are peer reviewed by other virologists.</p>

        <p>Well you get sent the paper to peer review  and in some specializations,  the paper are very specific and assessing how relevant/well done the paper is,  can be hard when you are not in this field (think state of the art and beyond tongue dissection information given to a brain chirurg, as a principle).  You have to give a quality respond and improvement suggestions after all,  not just basically understanding what they did.  </p>
<p>Yeah i mostly meant stuff in Angewandte and nature and more specific literature like anorganic analytics.</p>

        <p>I see nothing wrong with a specialized article written only for others in the field. But I do see a problem with interpreters creating a layman’s version and misrepresenting the contents or conclusion. Pop science is riddled with half truths.</p>

        <p>It never mattered. It was <em>always</em> an ethics issue, we all just dispute the facts hoping that we could convince the other guy to accept our beliefs. That's how every human being argues. No one cares about facts alone, <em>no one,</em> and it's important because facts are only supposed to be tools to support arguments, to back up reasoning, not to serve in its place.</p>

        <p>Science does matter. </p>
<p>"The science" doesn't exist, because science isn't a religion to be followed blindly and without thought or question. Science is a process, it is for asking questions and investigating, not for following blindly and just accepting it as true. Science doesn't mean looking at one area like epidemiology or infectious disease, or one so-called "expert", and losing focus and perspective on the bigger picture destroying lives. Science doesn't mean there's only one option, one way that is valid. Science doesn't ignore ethics. Ethics are deeply intertwined in the scientific process and decisions made - that went out the window with lockdowns. Science may look at the evidence but it is humans doing the science, making the observations and interpreting the evidence. Not everyone will form the same opinion based on the same evidence, and that's how it works.</p>
<p>The science" being presented as 100% fact and we must just accept it and bow down to the government and handpicked public health officials is wrong. It is wrong to not question information, questioning is how science advances. Science isn't infallible.</p>
<p>If no one questioned anything and just accepted what doctors and "The science" says we would still be treating people with lobotomies and all sorts of horrible things.</p>
<p>A single area of science can't give us the answers on what to do. We need to examine all aspects of knowledge and also commonsense. 
There is really no such thing as an expert. The idea of an expert is problematic.</p>

        <p>Yes - it doesn't matter because a lot of it is incorrect and all of it is being used in the wrong way. I'm sick of how it's become a religion - if you didn't even pass high school maths you don't deserve an opinion on IFR percentages because the concept is so far beyond the power of your tiny Kardashian-obsessed brain.</p>

        <p>I agree if it’s really that dangerous people can choose to stay home and most people would choose to do so. If they feel strongly enough to go out and do something that’s their right to do so. I think driving is a good analogy. Driving somewhere increases congestion and the likelihood of car crashes for other people but there aren’t people going around demanding people only do “essential” driving. Each person has as much a right to use the road as anyone else.</p>

        <p>Definitely, that's a great analogy. Of course the retort is you wear a seatbelt don't you but that's a silly idea</p>
