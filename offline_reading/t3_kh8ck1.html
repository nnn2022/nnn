    <strong>Advice about my daughter’s school</strong>
    <p><p>My daughter is in first grade and she loves school.  She loves her teacher, her friends, riding the bus, the actual school building, literally everything about her school.  But she HATES virtual days.  The district has flip flopped from hybrid, fully in-person (for 6 days) , back to hybrid, then in person again for a week and now fully virtual until end of January (started a week ago). It’s been a mess and I don’t trust that they will even go back after that since our governor has mandated strict covid quarantining  policies and our teachers union has pushed back at every step.  The union actually is behind this latest push to fully virtual bc they threatened a sick out.  </p>
<p>My husband and I decided to pull her out of school and put her in a Catholic school that has been open fully this entire year and has no plans of shutting down.  I’m just having reservations about a) putting her in a religious school since we are not religious b) taking her away from a school and teacher she loves and c) worrying that our district actually might got back full time after this and I’ll have put her through this major change for nothing.  I spoke w her current teacher and she said the principal (both are desperate to go back full time) said that after this the administration said they are going back full time and they are using this “shut down” to come up w a really solid plan.  Why they didn’t have a plan to start with, I don’t know. I honestly think they never wanted to go back full time and they just made a deal w the teachers union to do the switch to remote if the district can go back fully after it is over.  Furthermore this is a really excellent district and our taxes are high bc it is such a good district but they just were not prepared and didn’t have a good leader.  I’d like for her to attend it in the future but I’m so pissed of at what they are doing to these little children.  Her teacher is very good and she does a great job at teaching virtually but it does not live up to having a teacher in front of you. Also this new school is very small and I always get worried about small schools, too many chances for cliques.  The public school she is in is very big and there’s no chance of cliques bc you never have the same kids in your class year to year. </p>
<p>Am I being to rash in making this decision? Any other parents out there who have made switch bc of COVID?  What if this actually does all end in March/April,  we’ve made it this far what’s a few more months?  Anyone else go to small school that can give any  insight?</p></p>

        <p>I think you chose the right thing. I went to Catholic School, and as long as you can combat the dogma by promoting healthy spirituality at home, she'll have a great education. </p>
<p>I'm personally opting to homeschool my kids, one of which is approaching the age to begin light education. I'm painfully aware after years of growth that traditional schooling offers nothing but pacifying fodder designed to brainwash our most vulnerable. </p>
<p>I truly wish you the best on your journey with your daughter, and I commend you for your efforts to make her childhood as normal as possible. That whole "being able to be a child" thing and not being burdened by getting told they're diseased is, in my opinion, one of the more important aspects of childhood.</p>

        <p>I went to Catholic school my whole life. We had plenty of kids who came from Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, Atheist households. They learn about God and values for 20 minutes a day, and go to mass once a month. There are great teachers in Catholic school too and the education will probably be better. She's in first grade, you can worry about cliques when she hits middle school.</p>

        <p>I have no real advice. I was in super religious private school DOWN SOUTH for most of my youth. I really liked it, but I was 100% indoctrinated. I doubt Catholic school is that bad. It was a great education, but so much religion was mixed into it. </p>
<p>Our school is constantly flip flopping as well. It's maddening. They started with half of the students going FT on MT and the other half on ThF and they alternate Wednesdays. We found a care center for the off days. Then they shut down in early Nov or something and the care center took him full time. They kept him in his classes and his minimal homework done. 
Then the care center had a case and shut down the rest of the year. My son was getting his important virtual classes in the evening so we had to appeal to the school to switch him to the am classes. They agreed but told us it would be temporary. WHY? My ex and his new wife and I all adjusted our work schedules to be with him to help him stay on task. Then the care center decided to open back up tomorrow. Also the school has decided when they do open back up, the classes will now be half days on the same weird schedule WITH mandatory monthly covid tests. I'm exhausted. </p>
<p>Surprisingly enough, my kid just rolls with everything with no complaints or moping. He just hates the Rona and wants shit to go back to the way it was.</p>

        <p>I moved my kids to a parochial school.  The religion aspect isn't heavy and the rest of the educating is top notch.  This was the last thing I thought we would ever consider,  but in person&rt;&rt;&rt;&rt;&rt;&rt;&rt;&rt;Zoom or hybrid, so the decision was forced on me.</p>

        <p>My kids are doing much better academically and emotionally.  2 get to go all day every day,  one goes 2 hrs per day.  The public school is still closed and even if they open it won't be every day,  it will be 2 days a week at the most of in person learning.</p>

        <p>I send my son to Catholic school.  In first grade, expect 30mins of religion class a day, Mass once a week or so, and morning and afternoon prayers.  The rest is normal school.</p>
<p>If that is not your cup of tea, would it be possible to hire a private tutor to come a couple days a week to give her in person private instruction?  And maybe supplement with some extra play dates for the social interaction?</p>
