        <p>Suspected Bots. It seems everyone is crazy into this vaccine online. In real life, most people are still sane. 
It’s really hard, if not impossible, to realize who is a bot and who isn’t.</p>

        <p>I'm British. While I'm currently in the Philippines and have been since before this even began, I know how my friends and family back home feel about this through a combination of talking to them and checking their Facebook pages. </p>
<p>The majority of them simply trust the government that this is a one of the deadliest diseases in history and believe that the injections are the only way to save us.</p>
<p>About 25% of my friends (some of which I am no longer friends with due to their extreme views) have more extreme views. They think that anybody who questions the government and media instead of blindly accepting everything they say as the truth are idiots and regularly make posts ridiculing those who question things.</p>
<p>Around 5-10% of my friends are questioning things, but most of these aren't aware of just how much has been censored. </p>
<p>Only one of my friends has switched sides during the last year. Until recently she was completely on board with vaccine passports and forcing needles into arms. Then her healthy husband died minutes after being injected and she looked deeper into the events of the last year.</p>

        <p>I’m happy that you are away from the UK. I have a friend there, super smart guy getting his PhD at Cambridge, going on and on about how this vaccine is to save old people and he just can’t wait to do it to “do his part.” Man. They havent even been able to leave their house except for a couple of reasons (food, work) without getting fined. It sounds like it really, really sucks to be over there. I’m in Southern Arizona in the US and it’s a totally different situation—people go everywhere and don’t even wear masks in stores. The propaganda abt the super scary virus  is on the news, but most people just dont take it seriously. </p>
<p>I find it kind of interesting that the tendency to believe in propaganda seems to have much more to do with culture than it does intelligence. I’m sorry that your people have collectively lost their minds and I hope you can find a good community to people in the Philippines who see through this insanity.</p>

        <p>It's worse in the Philippines than it is in the UK. The restrictions here have been much more severe.</p>
<p>There also seem to be far fewer people questioning things. The majority of the people I encounter are absolutely terrified of the virus and think their masks are the only things stopping them from dropping dead in the streets. </p>
<p>During the global protest last month, the Philippines only had about 30 people in attendance.</p>
<p>People just blindly follow politicians here and do not dare to question them.</p>
