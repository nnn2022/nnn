        <p>What these mods are doing on those subs is a form of discrimination and hate speech.</p>
<p>Reddit Inc. can be held liable for allowing such activity on their platform.</p>

        <p>So not to be a pessimist, but if you are planning on gameplay on a rigged field, then you have <em>already lost</em> my friend. </p>
<p>What court is going to hear your case? What court will be sympathetic to your situation? </p>
<p>We have been conditioned over hundreds of years to falsely believe courts are impartial and law enforcement are protectors of civilians. 2020 has clearly shown us that none of that is the case. Judges are former lawyers from posh firms. Cops are A. All Freemasons and B. A protection squad for the rich elite. </p>
<p>Taking a mod to court won’t work and is akin to complaining to your parent about your sibling who is your parent’s favorite. Even if your argument is sound, I don’t think the parent will hear nor validate you. </p>
<p>Timelines are splitting. I would focus less on trying to “win against the house in a rigged Casino” and focus more on bridging and networking and creating forums and meeting places that you can better control or influence. Both digital and in-person.</p>
<p>If the world goes dark for a week and we are suddenly cut from Internet and TV, then Reddit will disappear like a fart. So don’t waste time on a pointless court case against people you can’t sue.</p>

        <p>AFAIK they're not breaking any laws. Preemptive blanket banning is still a dick move but you can't really sue over it. </p>
<p>IIRC the guidelines are only really a recommendation for good moderator-ism and hold no actual legal weight, especially since Reddit isn't ran by the government. (Although I wouldn't be surprised if the government had some influence on it.)</p>
