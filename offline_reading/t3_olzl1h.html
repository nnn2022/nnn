    <strong>How art can give us perspective</strong>
    <p><p>It's late and this idea has been bouncing around in my head for a while but recently I picked up the <em>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</em> and had an interesting conversation with one of the characters</p>
<p>For background the alien depicted had been in stasis for 50,000 years and was the last of his kind. (It's a really fun trilogy with accompanying novels and a hugely fleshed out history and universe)</p>
<p>The first minute is whats important </p>

<p>-Neural link</p>
<p>-The new form of vaccine</p>
<p>All of the little things that add up</p>
<p>Look im not saying David Icke was right, but it could have been machines instead of lizard people the whole time</p></p>
