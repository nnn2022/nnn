<p>My original comment posted in the thread above about Dr. Leana Wen, that admins of this sub considered "it was offtopic" and deleted it immediately, it's below:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Dr.Leana Wen</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It was head of Planned Parenthood Federation of America just before the "pandemic" started.</strong></p>

<p>&rt;On September 12, 2018, <strong>the organization announced that Leana Wen would take over as president,</strong> <strong><em>effective November 2018</em></strong>.[44]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>Wen was removed as president of Planned Parenthood by the organization's board of directors</strong> <strong><em>on July 16, 2019.</em></strong> Alexis McGill Johnson, a board member and former chairwoman, became the organization's acting president.[45]</p>
<p>Bill Gates early interview talking about his father who was head of Planned Parenthood. Bill remembers their talks at dinner time about "overpopulation":</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>MOYERS: But did you come to reproductive issues</strong> as an intellectual, philosophical pursuit? Or was there something that happened? Did come up on… was there a revelation?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>GATES:</strong> <strong><em>When I was growing up, my parents were almost involved in various volunteer things.</em></strong> <strong>My dad was head of Planned Parenthood.</strong> <strong><em>And it was very controversial to be involved with that. And so it's fascinating.</em></strong> <em>At the dinner table my parents are very good at sharing the things that they were doing.</em> And almost treating us like adults, talking about that.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;My mom was on the United Way group that decides how to allocate the money and looks at all the different charities and makes the very hard decisions about where that pool of funds is going to go. <em>So I always knew there was something about really educating people</em> <strong><em>and giving them choices in terms of family size.</em></strong></p>

        <p>Seems Dr. Wen is a part of the Rockefeller-Rothschild crew. Her resume is mostly Rockefeller Syndicate dominated: WHO, AMA, Planned Parenthood, Harvard, Washington University. </p>
<p>She’s a Rhodes Scholar so that brings her under the influence of the eugenics-loving Rhodes/Milner secret society founded at Oxford which Carroll Quigley dubbed “The Group”. Oxford also involved with developing the criminal AstraZeneca “vaccine”.</p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
<p>Actually it's interesting the s.society implications in the university - which basically all the old universities have deep connection with s.societies and beyond.</p>
<p>Those universities are basically "spring-boards" for future "agents" of the  s. society and certain figures like the rich guys mentioned by you.</p>
<p>Dr. Veith teach us that s. societies are basically lower "degrees" of the "higher" orders, such as the secret orders of a certain "church body", that has it's roots in the old roman empire. So one can't really put a finger on "them" directly - it would sound <em>farfetched and laughable.</em></p>
<p>Basically it seems that all the society as we know it, it was build by <em>the cult society and orders.</em></p>
<p>Found this if anyone interested to read more about what Fred said about Oxford and the societies: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120126072516/http://www.mailstar.net/quigley.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20120126072516/http://www.mailstar.net/quigley.html</a></p>

        <p>Well, until pandemic started it was in the domain of "conspiracy". But more people started to see more since pandemic started.</p>
<p>I would love that <strong><em>most of people</em></strong> would see this.</p>
<p>Our only peaceful option I see that more people will see, is that to expose the agenda and the evil doers behind it - so more and more people will know about it.</p>
<p>We are basically dealing with an <em>organized (ancient) cult. and she is  (tho low level) agent of that cult.</em></p>
<p>&rt;!They have most of Europe, whole USA, Canada, Australia and the other "commonwealths" (british colonies).  Most of Asia it's under dictatorship, same cult behind it. I know very little about Orient, but being the nature of the ancient cult and their organizations they can be there also.!&lt;</p>
<p>&rt;!So this ancient cult, that it's organized in different forms and factions around the world, and that it's already infiltated in the administrative powers of the countries of the world, wants to bring it all "together" - the classic "nwo" thing.!&lt;</p>

        <p>I understand it, these is no need to force yourself. Basically now you know what's up.</p>
<p>They are important piece but not what started it. They were military orders of the catholic church - church that had close ties with roman empire (I think it's one and the same).</p>
<p>So the roman empire might be the ones that started it. They were the only empire with wet dreams of enslaving the whole world under "one empire, one emperor".</p>
<p>&rt;Rome gained huge economic power through its position as the largest trade center in the ancient world. <em>Goods poured into the city from beyond the lands of the empire and within it.</em> <strong>For every new province Rome conquered</strong>, <strong>"</strong><strong><em>a new trading partner was born</em></strong><strong>."</strong> <em>Since the new province also "gained trading partners", everyone enjoyed "a better standard of living".</em></p>
<p>The history of roman empire itself it's kind of shady.</p>
<p>They didn't had such a great honest economy to sustain their rapid growth, armies, arts, etc. The only way to justify the  money to develop such an empire was through warfare and looting. Where they looted, they tried to made themselves "managers" of that land - basically enslaving the natives of the looted invaded land.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar?</p>

        <p>I <strong>really</strong> dislike this woman's stance on Covid (I honestly can't emphasise how much) but when it comes to Planned Parenthood the reason she was kicked out was because she wanted to move the organisation away from a sole focus on abortion to make it offer more broad support for general reproductive issues and women's health care.</p>
<p>She's also been an advocate of patient rights and campaigned against the influence of Pharma over doctors. Apart from her stance on Covid she might actually be pretty admirable. However, being a racist who supports orphans or a wife-beater who coaches little league doesn't excuse the worst excesses of someone's character and her almost fanatical glee in supporting the most draconic authoritarian policies is unforgivable. Given her past history I would put it down to demented belief in the BS rather than active support for depopulation agendas (not that the latter don't exist, just that she seems more useful idiot than active planner).</p>
