    <strong>Trip report - doctors appointment zoom meeting</strong>
    <p><p>Told them I don't wear a mask and will not - my new years resolution after wearing one for 6 months and I have not broken it.</p>
<p>They really want me to get blood work done and I said I'd be happy to do it without a mask but I'm sure that's not possible. No significant pushback about getting the vaccine or wearing a mask just kind of resigned and said it's "between a rock and a hard place." I guess that's nice, I did not want to argue about it or talk much about COVID during this appointment. I wonder if a lot of patients have said this same stuff.</p>
<p>I asked if they could do a house call or send me a home-draw kit and I'd take my own blood but there is no such option. Doctors did do house calls in the past but I guess that's not a thing anymore. So no blood work for me.</p>
<p>The only reason I bothered with a zoom appointment is because my doctor did not want to refill any of my prescriptions unless I went for a follow up appointment so I settled for this. Kind of ridiculous to hold me hostage like that but whatever.</p></p>

        <p>Funny how doctors are afraid of germs now, besides,how much faith do I put in a professional that is ignorant of the science they supposedly studied?</p>

        <p>Maybe I'm lying to myself but I want to believe that most of them aren't afraid, they're just conforming with regulations insisted upon by their employer (like mine works for a hospital network)</p>
