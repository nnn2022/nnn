        <p>Let me get this.</p>
<p>So they believe businesses and people are in two completely separate categories? Businesses get bankrupt but no-one will be affected because "bad business"?</p>
<p>How else to explain that having businesses bankrupt, and people laid off will help people pay down debt?</p>

        <p>Reddit is a massssssive propaganda platform... Just about every sub you can think of besides this one is brigated and controlled by several different "PR" firms. The irony is, vast majority of subs are dead now due to constant obvious shilling and they have been reduced to typing to themselves...</p>
<p>Same as facebook and twitter, constant 24/7 shilling... Even the comments on the propaganda networks articles, like financial times, new york times, etc... Some comments are bots, which have become extremely sophisticated, but a decent amount are made by human shills paid to spread dis-information and "control" the narrative as they call it.</p>
<p>This sub is heavily shilled as well, I'd say 1 out of 3 threads created are shills... Usually the ones showing some post of a twitter bot or a reddit shill, saying these people are crazy the doomers are crazy, trying to normalize the hoax and rationalize that there are people out there who are pro house arrest pro mask. Which is complete bullshit, nobody you ever met actually loves house arrest, it's only a phenomenon observed on social media due to paid astroturfers...</p>
<p>Modern propaganda isn't about convincing you it's real, it's just there to constantly remind you of the hoax and trying to normalize it.</p>
