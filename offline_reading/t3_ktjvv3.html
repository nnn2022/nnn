    <strong>I saw a video and it made me realize something about doomers...</strong>
    <p><p>I saw this video showing a sort of conference for socialists. Aside from a speaker instructing the audience not to talk to the police outside or any Trump supporters/conservatives, there was also a guy who kept asking the crowd to not talk amongst themselves, clap, or snap their fingers because he would get sensory overwhelmed and would reprimand them every time he heard someone or the audience forgot not to clap. Going on and on about respecting everyone who may have a disability and just generally needing to cater everyone's individual needs in the space. </p>
<p>This got me to thinking.. for years now, these type of outlying people have been trying to force society to cater to their own sensibilities. Whether its self diagnosed mental health issues they lead with in their profiles, trying to force society to accept biological truths as destructive fallacies(now don't get me wrong here, I support trans people 100%, but you can't say "follow the science" then turn around and say girls have penises or men have babies), or saying we must accept narratives that aren't backed by facts or statistics. These are the same people who are the loudest on the internet. </p>
<p>Now, they've gained a lot of traction with all of these things, but as much as it gets shoved in our faces, they can't actually force us to DO anything with it... Until now. </p>
<p>There's finally an issue at hand that is government backed with tangible parameters and consequences. They have been hungry to force you to accept whatever belief system they hold for so long, and now there is something with actual rules that they feel empowered to enforce. Especially since we entered a realm where its assumed that most people who oppose the rules are conservatives. </p>
<p>I think this is why a lot of us seem to mostly observe these dormers online but interact, largely, with people who seem, at the very most, apathetic, if not just as put off about it all, in real life (unless you live in a staunchly blue area)</p>
<p>Seems to me its just all the same people who have been taking to the internet for years trying to push their social agendas on the world having a grand old time finally getting to tell us what to do because this time the government already said so and they can throw thousands of literal deaths in your face for your non compliance this time around.</p></p>

        <p>My observation from where I live, the upbringing between someone who is 40 vs someone who is 30 or below is drastically different. People born in the 90’s were part of the first group of kids who stopped keeping score and everyone got a trophy. That’s why we started to see this society get pretty bad in about 2010.</p>

        <p>Can confirm. Was born in the 90s and it seems like a lot of the people I went to school with have this mentality. When I was growing up, I had a friend who was basically Cinderella. Her step mom was a horrible woman that treated her like the maid and babied her own son. Her dad was an abusive alcoholic that died when she was a teenager. But she always tried so hard to keep her own life together. She was so self reliant. Always had good grades, her room was always clean, she took care of her family in spite of how bad of a situation it was. Went on to put herself through college and become very successful. It humbled me a lot. I think she's a big part of the reason I never developed a hint of the entitlement my generation got. I always knew my life could be worse, and more importantly, that I would always be, ultimately, in control of its outcome.</p>
