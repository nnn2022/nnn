        <p>No need to be aggressive with anyone. Use data and cite sources. Listen carefully to what they say and refute it with facts. Same way you’d reason with anyone about anything</p>

        <p>You can't use data...since nothing they say, do, and believe has anything to do with science, data, logic, reason, or even the most basic common sense. I've given up trying to explain anything to them. It's a cult of madness, you can't reason with that. They will never listen and will just scream the equivalent of "blasphemer!" at you.</p>

        <p>What fascinating about all this is I have the exact opposite experience. I use data to make my case that the virus is dangerous and masks are effective etc, and many people just disagree. They don’t mention or present any data themselves. They just say the graph is a lie. All the graphs are lies.</p>
<p>I’ve only argued with data, I’ve never been presented anything but emotions, flawed logics, or just a complete lack of care about x-number of excess deaths/hospitalizations/anything else I can present data on.</p>
<p>It’s just amazing to me how both you and I could use this exact comment and feel completely right about it.</p>

        <p>You mean the dozens of serological studies that all make it clear that the actual number of those who contracted the virus is orders of magnitude higher than the official case count, which runs on pcr tests that only show active infections? You mean the high number of people who never knew they had the virus months ago because they didn't have a single symptom? You mean the CDC itself saying the IFR is only 0.26% and could be lower as more studies are done in the years to come? Information from numerous countries coming out that the excess mortality number is ridiculously low. What "data" are you going by, exactly? Cases rises and graphs that show that mean absolutely nothing. Mainstream media fear mongering articles mean nothing. An army of media-anointed "experts" saying absurd because they have political agenda mean nothing. What do you think the IFR is and what do you base it on? Outdated and erroneous data from early March? Dozens of serological studies all show the same thing. This is a low mortality virus that heavily skews towards the elderly. It cannot be classified as "dangerous" when its IFR is only slightly higher than the common flu, and the vast majority of people who get it will have either mild or no symptoms at all.</p>

        <p>I mostly have gone with excess deaths and hospitalization rates. I don’t claim to be an expert. Many people just say it’s entirely fake or wayyy overcounted and so by showing excess deaths, one should clearly see something big is happening.</p>
<p>Regardless I wasn’t trying to debate the specifics of the virus with you. I was pointing out that I’ve gone through the exact same issues you brought up in the opposite side of the issue. I present data and they go full emotion and opinion and offer no data, which you did, but most don’t. I’m the calm rational person using data to argue my points, the anti-virus/mask/lockdown/whatever people in my experience have been the ignorant emotional ones who have nothing but conspiracy to root their logic in.</p>

        <p>One look at mainstream reddit subs and other social media outlets shows that is complete bullshit. It is the pro narrative cult that are in full mass hysteria and have not an ounce of logic, reason, or common sense. Hospitalization rates? Hospitals are always running at near capacity, otherwise they would go bankrupt. That is why over one million hospital workers were furloughed when hospitals stopped doing "elective" surgeries and screenings, thinking they were going to get a mass influx of covid patients (it never materialized). Only hospitals in a few hotspots were actually overwhelmed, namely NYC, but keep in mind the NYC hospital system infrastructure problems and how it gets overwhelmed every bad flu season. NYC had an especially high number of people infected that no other place besides northern Italy (also a place regularly overwhelmed during flu seasons) had. That is why serological studies are now showing that over 60% of the population there contracted the virus. NYC is unique circumstances and not the norm. A bad flu season would have had the same outcome. Also, it is well documented at this point that thousands of deaths attributed to covid are either cases of where a patient died of another cause but was counted as covid death simply because they tested positive. There is also cases of where people died because of malpractice of putting people on ventilators when they just needed oxygen therapy, or critically ill patients who contracted covid in hospital settings. Then there are the governors that put covid patients back in nursing homes, so more nursing home patients died than would have. But even regardless of all that, the excess mortality rate is not significantly higher than any other year. At the end of the year, the harvesting effect will become apparent, as people who would have died several months later of their comorbidities, simply died earlier. Then there are countries like Sweden, who did not do draconian lockdowns, but this year they only a had a few hundred more deaths in the first five months of the year than they did in 2015.</p>

        <p>Again, didn’t really want to debate you. Just made a comment on some people on each side being stupid.</p>
<p>Hospitals generally run at near full capacity, so if covid cases keep pouring in the door, something has got to give. Either covid patients are treated or anyone else that needs a bed will be treated. If hospitals generally run at say 70% and they get a 30% bump in a few weeks from covid, that leaves no room for a car pile up. Hospitalization rate is approx 5% average. 1-3% in younger, 7-10% older. With a disease as infectious as this one, the numbers spiral out of control very quickly. You can see many states doubling their cases in a month and hospitalizations in a week. That’s not sustainable with 350 million of us.</p>
<p>One look at an average death rate vs current excess shows that’s just not the case of a typical bad flu. We’re significantly above traditional death numbers. By a LOT.</p>
<p>I’ve stopped using the covid official numbers as a point because people like yourself say it’s over counted. I’ve been going with total excess death as a whole. You’d have to be arguing not just that they’re calling non-covid causes covid, but that they’re lying about excess people dying period. There’s no way &rt;200,000 excess deaths aren’t primarily from covid.</p>

        <p>Again, what hospitals were overwhelmed besides a few hotspots like NYC. You know what happened when hospitals stopped doing any surgeries and treatments so they could focus on covud patients? They became empty and furloughed 1.4 million workers to avoid going bankrupt. You know what happened to all those makeshift treatment centers/temporary hospitals they built? They didn't use them. The mythical surge of covid patients just never came in. It became very clear early on that the severity of the virus was blown way out of proportion. But society still acted and still acts like it's a 3% mortality rate that would overwhelm the entire world's medical systems. It turned out to be absolute bullshit. Also do you know what counts as a "covid hospitalization" now? Anyone who goes in for any other reason is tested. If they test positive they are counted in covid hospitalization stats even though they are not actually being treated for covid. Also counted in the stats? A bunch of people going in with mild symptoms but staying a day or two.</p>

        <p>If this year and the past several years have proved anything to me, it's that having a well-reasoned and factually supported position doesn't mean jack. You'll always be on the defensive and losing with all the right ideas in the world. The emotionally-led mob will still overrule and overpower everything to get what they want.

        <p>You certainly can try in your own small ways to make a difference with argument, but your opposition doesn't even have to rely on arguments to get people on their side. They just rely on making them <em>feel</em> like anyone on the other side must be a bad person. And they have the educational elite, the voices of authority in political office, the entire entertainment industry on their side all ready to parrot exactly the same lines. They have the mass amount of social support they rely upon (instead of argumentation) to maintain confidence in their position.</p>

        <p>Doomers do not hold their positions based on reason, they hold them based on emotion. Reasoning with them is pointless. You have to demonstrate emotional strength instead. Don't argue. Don't justify your position with a line of evidence. Simply assert it, calmly and confidently: "I am not wearing a mask. I am confident in my understanding of the risks, and this is the tradeoff I've chosen"</p>
<p>Showing you're not afraid is 1000x more effective than giving them an argument they won't pay attention to</p>

        <p>If I had to pick one id go with A. 
But typically day to day in public I try to 
keep my presence to a very low minimum around people these days. Trying to reason with doomers or extreme political activists  or others in that category is like talking to a wall. Youd get further in a discussion with wilson the volleyball than those nuts.</p>

        <p>I’ve had 3 conversations with people who were super scared. I try to make this all sound like good news. </p>
<p>I say that a lot of people had the virus and barely knew they had it. My friend’s wife lost her sense of taste and smell for 3 days. That’s how he knew his family had it. I tell my scared friend “you could have had it and not know!”  They usually agree with me.  I use this as an opportunity to mention that my friend’s case wasn’t counted. There are thousands of people who got it and nobody ever counted them. It’s more widespread than we think. </p>
<p>Then I remind them that herd immunity is the new goal. I recite current statistics of death rates. I also remind them that by having had a coronavirus before, they already have some immunity. The immune system is very complex and it faces all kinds of microbes daily. Not just covid, but worse things like meningitis. Staying home is actually handicapping our immune systems. </p>
<p>I tell them the studies on vitamin d from the thousands of people who were hospitalized globally. Those with low vitamin d  levels fared far worse. The ones with higher levels did better. I encourage them to take D, C and zinc. I tell them that this is something they CAN do to prevent illness in a time when we have no control. It should be touted along with hand washing. If they do catch it, they will have done all they can to be in the healthiest state.</p>
<p>I can’t say I change their minds but I have planted a seed - hopefully with a positive effect.</p>

        <p>If it’s clear that they are angry and their mind is already made up, I try to end the conversation immediately. There’s really no point in wasting brain cells arguing with these types of people. Especially people you don’t know online. </p>
<p>Online I find that OK boomer tends to shut them up pretty quick. There’s really no response to changing the subject in that way. </p>
<p>If they’re not a boomer they might start yelling about how they’re a millennial or something but that’s usually the end of the conversation. Lol.</p>
<p>If they are a boomer they might yell some insult about millennials then that’s the end of the conversation.</p>
