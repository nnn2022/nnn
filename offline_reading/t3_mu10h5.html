    <strong>Genuine question: How do we resist?</strong>
    <p><p>How do we resist all the BS that is being pushed around right now in a constructive way? I don't mind being an anti-masker/vaxxer, or even a conspiracy theorist if that's what people want to call resisting tyranny... </p>
<p>But I am trying to think through what kinds of things we can all do to resist the lockdowns and virtue signaling that is going on right now WITHOUT playing into the doomer narrative. Because it seems like anything that goes against that narrative is quickly demonized and discounted and I worry that could be more of a set back than a way forward. </p>
<p>What do you guys think? I personally plan to resist the mask mandate in my area as well as the push for me to be vaccinated. What else can we all do? Also, at what point do we give in when challenged for something like masks? Or is it better to not give in at all even if it causes a scene?</p>
<p>Genuninally wondering what everyone is thinking about this. I believe the only way to beat the lockdowns and the corrupt officials is to stop listening and take the power of the people back. The problem is that it's a tricky game when the other side won't play fair.</p></p>

        <p>As of June 2020, I quit wearing masks voluntarily.  I'll keep one in my pocket and if confronted by a business owner or representative, I'll put one on.  But before I put it on I'll politely ask, "How long do you plan to do this?  They told us 15 days and I wore one for 60 days. It's been a year!" If I have time I'll often refuse the mask and politely leave. Particularly in small businesses where the owner loses money, this is effective.</p>
<p>I also smile at people as I make eye contact.  I'm generally a cheerful person, so this is easy.  So many people haven't been smiled at by a stranger for a year.  It takes the anger out of their heart before they can yell at you or try to grab their camera to "make an example" of you.</p>

        <p>Well let’s take a recent case where a disabled child and two masked parents were shopping at Lululemon. They were told their small child in a wheelchair was not allowed in the store and suggested that they could take turns watching over him outside. So maskless people have to wait outside .....? Is that moral coming from a brand which preaches “inclusiveness”? </p>
<p>How about in some countries where the unvaccinated have to eat outside while only the vaxed can eat indoors ? How is that any different than the Nazis making the Jews walk in the gutter to avoid contact with the rest of the population because they were “unclean”. Why do you think they were so scared of the “unclean”....? It was because the “unclean” were thought to be disseminators of disease, typhus in particular. Do you see where this is heading?</p>

        <p>Which brand do you refer to that promotes ‘inclusiveness’, you can’t compare a global pandemic any in form to Nazi Germany where millions were killed for their beliefs, don’t be so dramatic - there is no similarity, all shops are asking is that customers wear a mask to help lower the spread of a virus that exists all over the world, not just America</p>

        <p>Clearly everything I said just went over your head. There will always be a good excuse to justify the latest brand of tyranny. Just like 9/11 and the patriot act, don’t expect any of the government’s new “powers” to go away anytime soon. At this point you are either a troll, grossly misinformed, or gullible in the extreme.</p>

        <p>Mass protests have always worked in the past. We're a weird generation that is trying to solve a global problem on an individual level. I don't see me not wearing a mask changing anything, despite the popular belief on this sub. And when people gather outside, it's a couple of thousands. Easily ignored and labeled as demonic "anti-vax".</p>

        <p>I hate to be a “doomer” but it is already a losing battle. The dumb people, who are acting based on fear porn the media puts out heavily outnumber those of us who are able to stop, take a step back, and analyze everything clear headed.</p>
<p>My business has been lucky to be considered “essential” and I work everyday, don’t wear a mask at work, but keep one in case the covid cops show up. It’s tricky to fight against a regime that’s being reinforced by everyone’s emotional state, as well as enforced by the private militia aka police. </p>
<p>I wish pre-covid I was financially stable enough to the point where I had time to not work, go out and protest, spend time spreading the truth in a constructive way in my local community, but all I can do right now is resist to the best of my ability. </p>
<p>I’m not ever getting tested for covid, even if it means I have to devoid myself of every modern convenience and luxury, if it means I’ll never travel outside my city again, I’m not taking the test or vaccine. That’s the main resistance I can do. </p>
<p>For the masks, I hate to wear them but it’s easier to put it on for 5 minutes, run in the grocery store, get what i need, and then go back to fresh air, than to spend the 30 minutes arguing with staff and becoming a YouTube video “anti masker meme”, because whoever does film that will spin it to make me to be the villain, and that doesn’t help our cause, even if what we say in the video is true. </p>
<p>My sister city next to me has basically a “celebrity” anti masker, and when I look at his “career” in this I look at how I could do what he does, and I know I couldn’t devote that much time and energy to the cause, as well as being in the spotlight so much. He knows laws and basic science well, it’s not hard to go into a business and recite them. But it’s a persons business and at the end of the day their own stupidity will let them decide whatever they want to, truth or not. Based on their own ignorance and fear of covid, or based on the fear of getting cops to fine. I heavily respect businesses that stay open and resist the new world order, going forward the only way we could ever win is by unity, but that’s not going to happen so we have to scrape together whatever we can for the cause and hope that we have enough numbers, and financial resources to fight this. Together is the only way, no matter how educated we are, or how much we say that’s true they dictators don’t care, they just want more control over us and they are going to easily give that up.</p>

        <p>I live in a country where it's illegal to leave your home without a mask. I usually keep my mask off right up until I have to go into a store, then I put it on just over my mouth.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Occasionally I'll get the Nazi who tells me to cover my nose. At that point I usually stand straight up, give a Nazi salute and loudly proclaim "Heil MINSA!" (our health authority).</p>
<p>The louder the better. The store I regularly go into only had to have me do that once, now they don't say anything when I walk in with the mask not covering my nose.</p>
<p>If I were in the US I'd salute Herr Fauci.</p>

        <p>I don’t wear the mask and try to kindly influence those around me into questioning the vaccine, as well as the whole kettle of stinking fish. I tell people that now is the time to detach from the world and align with Christ. That is all I presently know to do. I had some dreams that make me think that they are going to win. Many will wind up living in a virtual version of the world. But I can still be me, and I’ll never ever go along with this.</p>

        <p>You don't resist, there's a reason why all experienced scientists and researchers tell you to wear a mask, BECAUSE IT WORKS. And to answer why vaccinated people wear a mask, it is because there are constantly new variants that the vaccine may not combat.</p>

        <p>Where did I say this global lockdown would never end? Covid-19 may live among us for the rest of our lives and become somewhat of a new flu, but as our research develops we won't have to worry as much about it because of the vaccines, the vaccines that DO work and don't kill you.</p>
