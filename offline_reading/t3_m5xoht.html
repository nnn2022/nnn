    <strong>Lost a lot of close relations to Covid</strong>
    <p><p>My parents and I are very clued in on the 'scamdemic' as dad likes to call it but over the last year we have become almost estranged from many beloved family members who vilify us for our beliefs.</p>
<p>It has been incredibly difficult to see my parents be mocked and shouted down for sharing what is the truth. It feels like a lot of our family has been torn apart. I am sure many here have experienced the same thing.</p>
<p>I see so many family members and friends (and myself) suffering with mental health during this past year. But we have become a punching bag for the rest of the family to take out their shit on. My family dynamic and the world as I knew it has changed dramatically and I am finding it difficult to deal with the anger and hostility that my family face from relitaves who I loved dearly every day.</p>
<p>They see us as ignorant, murderous conspiracy theorists who are going to kill my grandparents...and probably everyone else.
We have all had Covid and it felt like a flu... But I couldn't taste anything for a while and felt pretty tired after wards. My 80 y/o dependant grandmother with COPD caught the same bug. Didn't even have to go to hospital.</p>
<p>I am just so tired. I am so distraught seeing people I love so much talk to us with such venom and hatred.
I am sure many of you have similar experiences.
Do any of you have any advice on how to cope better?
I also just feel like I needed to vent somewhere. It's been real tough.</p></p>

        <p>Those people aren't needed in your life. It's going to be sad and if they're very close you're going to miss them. Something will happen and you're going to want to call them to tell, you're going to want to text them when you hear something that scares you. Don't. Just don't. Mourn the loss and move on. </p>

        <p>It is an incredibly difficult thing  to do. But I cannot stand by and watch them treat my family this way it sickens me, if they find it so easy to turn their back on us why should we fight to keep them in our lives. Thank you for your advice.</p>

        <p>Exactly. </p>
<p>I've had to cut off people I love dearly and I still wish them the best but they weren't good for my family or my mental health anymore. This includes friends and family both.</p>
<p>You have to take care of yourselves. Call me a doomer but I suspect the worst is yet to come and I've consolidated my circle into the safest, strongest, most reliable and loyal one I can to endure it. I'm no longer here to try to change minds because I don't personally feel it's safe to continue trying to save others.
I wish them safety and strength.</p>

        <p>That must have been very difficult for you. I agree 100%. The worst is yet to come and we have to brave our selves. I wish every day that we were just crazy conspiricy theorists and that we are completely wrong. But that ain't gonna happen and we gotta take care of ourselves I just wish we didn't have to sacrifice so much.</p>

If you have good health and young like under 50 you should be fine. Even I who has a metabolic disorder wouldn’t bother it I didn’t live with my family who are mainstream media obsessed.</p>

        <p>And look up the patent 2020-060606 and the connection to the vaccine. Apparently it’s a nanotechnology that mines cryptocurrency. Yeah, imagine that in your body and someone hacking it and make you feel pain if you speak badly of the government.  Like if it’s a move to digital money is the thing but it’s frightening to think there’s a computer in your body that is mining money.</p>

        <p>I don't really buy into that theory now. I do fully belive that big pharma are gonna make trillions out of experimental vaccines being forced on the population. Money, control and power is what they are after and they don't need cryptocurrency or nano technology to obtain that. Fear mongering and oppression is all they need to reach that end.</p>

        <p>My Mom already has a severe mental problem and the state of the world has not made it any better. I hung up on and blocked her last April. Life is hard enough right now without having to listen to negativity and mocking. She's literally crazy and believes in conspiracies, but really thought it was hilarious af when I said "I'm just worried they're going to rush out a vaccine" back in April. Lol I was right too. </p>
<p>So she's just going to stay blocked. I still sent her bday and xmas cards, but I have no interest in speaking with her. She calls 1-2 times a year anyway. Not a huge loss. I just hate that she's moved in with my Gramma, who raised me, because there is no f ing way I'm driving 13 hours to see Gramma and also have to deal with her. </p>
<p>I'm sorry. I wish you luck in deciding how to handle this. It really is best to cut toxic people loose.</p>

        <p>Thank you. After a lifetime of dealing with it (I'm 40), you just get used to it and it stops being upsetting. She's been getting worse though, so I really can't be around her even once a year anymore. And I adore my Gramma. That's what is tough. Luckily when she baits me and I react, she gets "so offended" that she storms off and avoids me like the plague for the rest of the time. Me and her only grandson lol. So pathetic. But that 13 hour drive. Uggh. I don't have it in me.</p>

        <p>My husband and I don't agree on covid.  Because it's essentially moot, I just don't talk about it with him.  I'd prefer that he could see through it, but it doesn't change much of what we're doing - the world is still going to be crazy. We're still going to see less of our friends. It's a matter of choosing your battles. He's already chilled out a lot.</p>
<p>Honestly, I think it's more the values taught by leftism that are the problem.  They're the ones will get up in your face about it and are generally unwilling to see any other side. They think it's ok to bully people and feel righteous about it if you're following the agenda.  And that's their "good" deed for the day. It's like a giant case of narcissism.</p>
<p>Covid did open my eyes to how messed up certain modern mind sets are.  Just wait until the banks push their new ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) credit scores.  Those unbearable friends on Facebook are going to be even more unbearable with the virtue signaling. If you're baking with Bank of America Merril Lynch, it's time to move to a smaller, local bank.</p>

        <p>Just call it like it is. In a year or two everyone is going to act like they knew covid wasn't a big deal from the start and claim that they never over reacted.</p>

<p>Saying "bring in the social workers!" nonstop made people embarassed about the defund the police thing.</p>
