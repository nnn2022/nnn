        <p>I mean... If they're still an area shoving tubes down your throat upon a positive test you're a goner.</p>
<p>If you're bad off enough to be going to the hospital with it in general of course you're more likely to die than someone who never had to go to the hospital as they did not get as ill.
This is assuming you're a normal person that doesn't rush to the ER over an eat infection or broken toe.</p>

<p>Understood and agreed. A separate question, which I mean to ask is: If you're bad off enough to be going to the hospital with it, does actually going to the hospital actually increase your odds of survival, or does it actually decrease your odds of survival? It may well decrease the odds of survival, unless there's evidence otherwise.</p>

        <p>Not really related to covid but medical-business:</p>
<p>I went to a vet-clinic with my sick rabbit Jonas, who had severe breathing-problems.</p>
<p>He stood there for 3 days, they told me on the phone that he hadn't improved and would most likely die a painful death of suffucation if they took him out of the O2-chamber. They recommended to euthanize him and asked for my confirmation.</p>
<p>I wanted to first look at him before making such decision. When I saw him, I could already tell that he had vastly improved during his stay.</p>
<p>So I took him home with me.</p>
<p>Three days later his symptoms were completely gone and he was back to doing his normal rabbit-things.</p>
<p>How should an incident like that impact my opinion on the medical-business?</p>

        <p>Are there governments who track this data honestly?</p>
<ol>
<li>Number of sick people who died at home?</li>
<li>Number of sick people who died at hospital without ventilator?</li>
<li>Number of sick people who died at hospital with ventilator?</li>
</ol>
<p>I have a feeling most deaths will fall in the 3rd group, but I've never seen this data if it exists.</p>
