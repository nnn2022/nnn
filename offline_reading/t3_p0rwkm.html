    <strong>Template letter against vaccine passports/mandatory vaccines - please feel free to alter and send to your local/national politicians!</strong>
    <p><p>Dear ______ ,</p>
<p>I am deeply concerned by the discussion currently taking place in ______ to potentially mandate the COVID-19 vaccine in certain settings. Beyond the frightening implications such a decision could have on civil liberties, i.e., enforced medical discrimination, there are a number of valid reasons why some _____ians remain hesitant to take the COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccine are based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has never been approved for human use. Previous attempts at developing therapeutic drugs using this technology resulted in toxicity from repeat doses, which is particularly troubling given the active discussions on booster shots due to waning efficacy:</p>
<p>&rt;“Moderna had to pivot. If repeated doses of mRNA were too toxic to test in human beings, the company would have to rely on something that takes only one or two injections to show an effect.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/">https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/</a><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“But when repeated doses of mRNA are needed to resupply a protein over a lifetime, side effects—potentially due to the buildup of lipid nanoparticles in the body or an inflammatory response to foreign RNA—loom larger.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/messenger-rna-gave-us-covid-19-vaccine-will-it-treat-diseases-too">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/12/messenger-rna-gave-us-covid-19-vaccine-will-it-treat-diseases-too</a></p>
<p>Unlike most vaccines, which typically take 10-15 years to develop and test, the current set of COVID-19 vaccines have only undergone a few months of clinical trials and have no long term safety profile. Consequently, it is unknown whether antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or other autoimmune issues, which occurred in previous trials of coronavirus vaccines (e.g. SARS and MERS), could arise at a later time or with different, mutated strains of the virus.</p>
<p>The vaccine has already been linked with heart inflammation (myocarditis) in young adolescents/adults, with an incidence rate of up to 1 in 3000 according to one report submitted to the Israeli Ministry of Heath. This age group, in particular, has a significantly lower risk of developing severe reactions from the virus itself, with an infection fatality rate estimated to be less than 0.01%.</p>
<p>In addition, the efficacy of the vaccine and its ability to reduce transmission remains under question. In many countries with high percentages of their population fully vaccinated, including Iceland, Israel, and Malta, cases are markedly rising and the majority of hospitalized patients are now fully vaccinated. Gibraltar, in particular, has the highest vaccination rate in the world (greater than 99%) but is still currently undergoing its second highest wave in COVID-19 cases. New data from the Israeli Ministry of Health also suggests significantly lower efficacy over time:</p>
<p>&rt;“The Israeli statistics also appeared to paint a picture of protection that gets weaker as months pass after vaccination, due to fading immunity. People vaccinated in January were said to have just 16% protection against infection now, while in those vaccinated in April, effectiveness was at 75%.”<br>
&rt;<br>

<p>In this case, the burden of proof lies on the vaccine makers to prove the safety and efficacy of their vaccines. While many ______ians have taken the vaccine, others prefer to take a more cautious approach with a novel, experimental medication and should not be discriminated against based on this personal health decision. This is an absolutely fundamental, red line issue for many ______ians like myself – the freedom to decide what medical procedures I undergo without fear of discrimination or segregation. </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p></p>
