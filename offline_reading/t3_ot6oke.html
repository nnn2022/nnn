    <strong>are we 100% sure the vaccin is dangerous</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not taking the vaccin but i'm still on the fence about if it's really that dangerous. What do you guys expect in a few years to people injected the vaccin in their bodys?</p></p>

        <p>I expect the people who were consumed with fear and blindly took experimental injections at the authorities dictates, will blindly following along with their other nefarious machinations. That’s the most dangerous part of it all.</p>

        <p>It makes me realize how genocides happen. I used to be baffled at how people can go along with that sort of thing, but if the government says they are not actually people, and it's your duty to go along with it... The rest is history.</p>

        <p>First let’s look at the data: According to the CDC the chance of adverse effects from vaccines are at 0,1%. At the moment.</p>
<p>Kids have died from the vaccines that would have beaten Covid with ease.</p>
<p>The IFR of Covid is 0,00003% to 0,005% from the age of 0 to 70.</p>
<p>Influenza is statistically literally a 100 times more deadly then Covid for people below the age of 20.</p>
<p>If you are healthy and below the age of 60-40 Covid is basically just a flue, below 40 most are asymptomatic  or just have a cough for a few days.</p>
<p>78% on the IcU is obese, 84% vitamin D deficient. 95% of fatal cases had an average of 4 co-morbidities.</p>
<p>This isn’t a virus problem but general bad dieet and health.</p>
<p>I got Covid, I’m 36 and a Smoker, only knew I had gotten Covid as I got the anti-bodies test. I’m not vaccinated and I didn’t get sick from Covid while I have known many now who gotten very ill from the vaccines.</p>
<p>The Vaccination Program is failing and certainly not the “final solution.”</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/</p>
<p>I have never trusted pharmaceutical companies with Billions in Criminal Charges for fraud, faking results, paying of the FDA, paying off EU health organisations and politicians, blackmail etc nor have I ever trusted corrupted organisations that constantly have been exposed of lying and bow to dictatorships and authoritarian regimes like the WHO, CDC and my own countries RIVM do to China. And I never will trust them.</p>
<p>Big Pharma is granted immunisation from all damages caused by the vaccines. That should tell you enough.</p>
<p>As example Pfizer, with the record of highest fine in history and moderna:</p>
<p>https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html</p>
<p>https://abcnews.go.com/Business/pfizer-fined-23-billion-illegal-marketing-off-label/story?id=8477617</p>
<p>Nor do I trust my Government.</p>
<p>You are not asking me to “trust the science” you are asking me to trust completely untrustworthy people and originations.</p>
<p>I’m not anti-vax, I trust the polio vaccines etc, but this is something completely different. This is new, experimental and not a classic “vaccine” but an mRNA Therapy and even one of it’s co-creators has been warning that using MRNA in this way is very risky and got censored.</p>
<p>https://news.yahoo.com/single-most-qualified-mrna-expert-173600060.html</p>
<p>How can I trust the research and science claiming the safety when I can’t even trust the scientists, researchers and peer reviewers backed by corrupted government, big tech and media?</p>
<p>The whole wuhan lab censorship debacle or the suppression of the drug Ivermectin, that shows great promise in treating Covid but is un-pattended and cheap so Big Pharma can’t make money from it; shows how untrustworthy the public information truly is.</p>
<p>https://open.spotify.com/episode/7uVXKgE6eLJKMXkETwcw0D?si=s3xozYAPSrqNkG9gF7E6pQ&amp;dl_branch=1</p>
<p>I rather die or flee the country then take the vaccines of known top Criminals. And that’s my right. Luckily it’s “my body my choice” that protects the right to refuse vaccines in my country. They can’t force vaccine mandates without disbanding the right to abortion and refuse organ donation etc. So they probably will never have mandates here.</p>
<p>This goes for most of the west btw. The countries with vaccine mandates effectively destroyed the protection of your own body and gave the ownership of your body to the government, but maybe, that’s what the government wants.</p>
<p>And this has sparked mass protests world wide like in France and the UK.</p>
<p>I value freedom above safety and that should be my life to live like I want to.</p>

        <p>What we can tell from the short-term is that the vaccine has caused many deaths and serious vaccine injuries, but it's still a somewhat low percentage. What we don't know is if it will cause any long-term side effects because long-term studies haven't been done yet.</p>
<p>If you're an old, obese and/or sick person maybe it's worth it to gamble on the vaccine. If you're young and healthy, maybe the vaccine carries more risk than the coronavirus, and it seems even vaccinated people can be infected by and transmit new variants.</p>
<p>That's why taking the vaccine should be a personal choice, in my opinion.</p>

        <p>We don't know and we can't know. Time will tell.</p>
<p>What we <em>do</em> know is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Young (&lt;50) people are at statistical near zero risk from covid</li>
<li>They've never said this is a sterilizing vaccine (prevents spread), and data we have today points to the fact it is not.</li>
<li>The government is acting <em>weird</em> to say the least. They're pushing this so incredibly hard</li>
<li>The government hasn't said: you get the vaccine, you're now free. There is no guarantee for the government to let go of you when you get the shot. Compliance gets you nowhere.</li>
<li>The government keeps shoving the covid deaths in your face daily, but it seems to not have the same interest around making the vaccine deaths/injuries as much public. I wonder why.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the above context, why would you ever take this? Even if it's not dangerous? If it really is dangerous long term, I can't say I will be surprised.</p>

        <p>The current vaxxes may just be a precursor to more boosters and getting sheep used the system of their entire life being dependent on the government putting something into them, or be cut off from everything. 
Eventually leading to the mark of the beast (look it up).</p>
<p>We know for a fact they are damaging a significant chunk of people, far more than any other vax, a cursory glance at r/CovidVaccinated or VAERS can show this.</p>
<p>Whether things worsen over the next few years for those who have already taken it, who knows. It could be a full blown slow wipe out for billions of people, or this could be the extent of it and the aim is just to keep them coming back for more. </p>
<p>Personally I think the people in charge aren't stupid enough to wipe out most of those who took the vax so quickly and give the game away. I think it'll be more of a slow burn with more and more dependency until they can't say no to the mark of the beast.</p>

        <p>I don’t know for sure, but that’s really not the biggest reason why I don’t want it. I’m under 30. I have no pre-existing conditions. Even if the vaccine were perfectly fine, I still don’t think there’s a reason for me to take it, because I’m under 30 with no pre-existing conditions. There’s no reason for me to put a substance in my body just because, when I’ve made a risk analysis and have decided that I’m not at serious risk for Covid, so it’s just another medication I don’t want. I didn’t get the HPV vaccine either, because at 18 I was, and still am, a virgin waiting for marriage, and HPV is sexually transmitted.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m concerned about possible side effects, especially fertility, but in general that’s not my biggest concern. My health is about my health. I don’t put stuff in my body for other people. It’s not my job to protect other people, it’s my job to make medical decisions for me.</p>

        <p>No, and anyone who says otherwise is a conspiracy theorist with a persecution complex. Here's how I see it: these companies aren't trying to poison you or microchip you or whatever. They have a high incentive to make a safe product that works. However, they have a long history of fudging the results and hiding negative effects; they also have lobbyists that pay people in government a lot of money to help push their products despite this.

        <p>I don’t think it’s a depopulation thing. Definitely seems like a precursor to let people become desensitized to perpetual injection of whatever the flavor of the future is.  It seems like a preliminary path to create a subhuman group out of anyone who ever disagrees with the government. </p>
<p>Rather than it actually being bad right now, just seems to set the table for Stalinist dehumanization of political opponents. </p>
<p>The future seems like one of authoritarian oppression. Lack of major wars in many recent years has created some soft people who have no idea that governments don’t act out of benevolence. They can’t comprehend that their government would act in self interest.</p>

        <p>I've done a lot of research on this, I don't believe it to be dangerous. </p>
<p>Messenger RNA already happens naturally in the body all the time.</p>
<p>mRNA breaks down almost instantly after its told the cell to create spike protein. </p>
<p>Spike protein cells can spread around a bit which is slightly worrying but they are all broken down by the body fairly easily within days. The immune system eats them essentially and other things in your blood break down the rest. </p>
<p>So there shouldn't be any long term side effects from what's in the vaccine because it's only a temporary signal. The issue is because of the big immune response where there is always a risk of complications. </p>
<p>But for perspective, these complications can occur every time you get infected with anything. It's just the bodies natural defences. </p>
<p>Most of the big claims on here (heart inflammation, infinite spike proteins) have no basis. The inflammation is just the immune system kicking in and can happen every time a person theys the flu as well. The guy who said infinite spike proteins has been discredited and is just 1 flawed paper going round and round. There's also a claim saying it creates Parkinson's and prion diseases, but again that's just paper from a serious long time antivaxxer and has not been peer reviewers, all just nonsense theory.</p>

        <p>Yeah but that's what I already addressed in my post. The immune response is very large. More likely to get complications. But this can also happen when you get the actual virus and over or under active immune systems is what's killing Covid patients in hospital. </p>
<p>I haven't seen anything that points me to there being any long term effects. Even factoring in that the dose Is too high, we still have given it to almost a billion people and the number of deaths from this is in the 10s of thousands. Its very small and much lower than the virus itself.</p>

        <p>The amount of reporting to VAERS is on average at around 1%. There is also pressure to disassociate issues from the vaccines…where for example if a patient steps out and then has issues, it may NOT get reported. Also Dr Malone has expressed the seriousness of the spike protein and of it being a toxin. Read his Twitter feed, there is a lot you (purposely) overlooked</p>

        <p>Yes it may be a toxin. It gets broken down quickly and can't replicate after the initial batch. You also get spike proteins from Covid in much higher amounts and for longer. </p>
<p>If you've convinced yourself Covid isn't so bad then the jab has significantly less exposure to the spike protein than Covid would have. </p>
<p>Yeah I'm sure there are problems with Vaers. Just like the dodgy Covid stats you also can't link the Vaers data to the vaccines. There is also obviously massive censorship. </p>
<p>But these things need some perspective. It's not going to be 100 times underreported. We also have data in Europe and my country UK which much stricter measures and there's been nothing to suggest these are unsafe almost 7 months later. There has also never been a vaccine delivered on this scale so the absolute number of deaths Is going to be stupidly high.</p>
<p>Vaers is what, 10k? 155 million dosed in America. That's 0.0065% mortality. And for context that jab was given to older people (80+) first and many will be dying naturally and count within those numbers. So what percentage of those deaths is even from the vaccine? We don't know. The data is flawed.</p>
<p>And as you scew lower it's even more negligible. I think I saw it was about 500 in the under 30 group last I looked. That's a 0.0003% mortality from the vaccine. That again, could be flawed and have unrelated deaths. </p>
<p>Where are these big scary numbers of mass deaths from vaccine please?</p>

        <p>You are doing everything you can to just avoid the topics brought up by Dr. Malone. Yes we heard what you had to say, now others can read the Twitter feed of what Dr. Malone has shared. And from the general Overview, the current covid vaccines are basically ineffective. The so called antibodies last about 6 months. In Israel they have shown to have an efficacy rate of 40%, with it declining more and more with each new variant. Vaccinated people all over are getting sick. My wife’s coworker got covid , so the vaccine just gave him the illusion of protection.</p>
<p>And in terms of covid itself, the PCR test for it was basically declared invalid since it couldn’t tell apart flu and covid …and the amount of false positives it gave . We don’t know the amount of true covid cases and true covid deaths. It’s all been fake ….anything reported should be questioned . Not saying covid is fake, but saying the number of cases are</p>

        <p>I addressed it fine. You're now making other points when we were talking about vaccine safely. </p>
<p>The numbers matter, twisting theories doesn't. Im against the vaccine as well because ive already had Covid. But if you're going to try and convince people the jab is dangeorus you're going to need more than a few tweets. You can even agree with Dr Malone and still understand it's safe. He's really not saying anything other than the dose is possibly too high and it's not required. </p>

<p>If you've been studying mRNA for so long then maybe you could give your opinion on the previous mRNA vaccines that could'nt be brought to market because the animals died quite some time after recieving the jabs? or was that not on your syllabus?</p>

        <p>No. </p>
<p>Do you know what myocarditis is? It's inflammation of the heart. </p>
<p>Do you know what causes it? Your bodies immune system. </p>
<p>Any vaccine stimulates the immune system. As does any virus. You're just as likely to get myocarditis from Covid.</p>
<p>Yeah I've seen all those points about mRNA. Yes mRNA is new. But it's also been around long enough for certain aspects of it to be known. Such as how fast it gets broken down by the body showing us that the side effects are more focused to the short term if there are any, and that's what we have data for. </p>
<p>What mRNA was given to mice? Comparing the 2 is like comparing putting sugar in a car engine instead of gasoline because they are both types of fuel.</p>
<p>You do realise that messenger RNA happens in your body all the time, it's a totally natural thing it's not something new.</p>
<p>Comparing it to a study in a nice just because it's also messenger RNA just shows a huge lack of understanding to how it works and if you still don't get this point I'm making to you you need to do a little bit more research into what it actually is. </p>
<p>It would be nice to have animal studies with the actual vaccine sure, but old studies just using mRNA are not even comparable.</p>

        <p>Of course. Many viruses can cause inflamation of the heart, valves and surrounding structures. But to conflate being naturally infected with being injected with a virus (or the data to tell your cells to make its parts) is a little silly.</p>
<p>Someone may naturally get infected by covid and never experience a viral load so extreme as to get myocarditis. In fact, many age and health brackets have high survivability and experience extremely mild symtpoms.</p>
<p>However, someone who only experienced mild infection could be injected with mRNA and then develop myocarditis or pericarditis.</p>
<p>So we know from documents that Pfizer released to Japan that the lipid nanoparticles in the vaccine spreads throughout the body, unlike other vaccines. The bodies main transport system is it's circulatory system. This gives the mRNA a direct pathway to the heart, telling it's cells to create spike proteins and for the possibility of an exagerrated immune response to occur.</p>
<p>Therefore individuals who are predisposed to developing myocarditis have a higher chance of developing it from mRNA vaccines than from natural exposure to Covid.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course, animals and humans react differently. But you're fighting my point here. Animal trials were not successful, which is why it did not move on to human trials. We don't have any data for what mRNA technology can do to humans, nevermind long term. and these were long term deaths in animals too.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And you shouldn't conflate the bodies natural mRNA with what the vaccines actually are. Sure we have mRNA telling our cells to create different proteins all of the time. But that doesn't mean that we can assume that the our cells being told to create spike proteins is safe. That's specifically what needs studying - The effects of mRNA vaccine induced spike protein production on the human body - not - Is mRNA safe for humans - because it is.</p>
<p>Drinking water and breathing air is fine. Injecting water and air into a vein is not.</p>

        <p>This is actually a great write up, you've filled in a lot of blanks for me.</p>
<p>Doesn't make me feel too good about getting my jab on Saturday, but don't really have a choice in my country.</p>

        <p>Aw man...</p>
<p>Let's both hope I've got the sceince all wrong and there isn't a problem with the vaccines.</p>
<p>There's really nothing you can do to postpone it?</p>
