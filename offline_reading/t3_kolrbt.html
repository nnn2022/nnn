    <strong>Personal New Year's Eve and past days experience in Norway - What's really going on? + Fearing for the future and next generation</strong>
    <p><p>Hi. I thought I'm gonna share with you what I experienced during the past days because I keep thinking about it and it still doesn't really make sense to me, so maybe it's good to speak it out. I live in one of the top 5 most populated Norwegian cities, where as you can suspect, since it's Norway, it's not even that huge when it's about population - only around 130,000 people.</p>
<p>The city has had a new mayor for a year now but honestly, she hasn't been really active, heck I didn't even know who she was or how she looks, even seeing the city's facebook page, there hasn't been much information about her or her plans during this year. That is until a little bit over a week ago.. Out of the blue, she popped up everywhere with all her plans, like for example mandatory masks on public transport. She started to post pictures of herself in a mask, writing much more about that we need much stricter rules and they are coming etc. That plan about mandatory masks on public transport is of course ridiculous and I think that it's just a great way to make yet another conflict in a society - as always delivered to you by the government. I've already had evil looks form others because I was one of very few on the bus without a mask. I try to not make to much eye contact but in addition I struggle with social anxiety, so you can imagine things are not always easy and even thinking about people constantly staring at me can trigger faster breathing, shaking and dizziness in me. Thanks to the mayor for sudden popup and trying to be a hero of the day when the circumstances are suitable.. Maybe I wouldn't care that much, but I see that actually many cities and generally countries in Europe apply same strict rules at the same time.. Even the ones that claimed to be doing better and having things under control. Even here during the past weeks only 4 people have been admitted into the local hospital supposedly because of Covid and probably thousands have been tested during the past weeks. That makes things even weirder with sudden mayor's appearance and her decisions. Prevention measures or something bigger coming? Who knows.
I want to also add to that that on the latest conference in Norway, the prime minister kept repeating the sentence "Our day is coming soon". For some reason she spoke also quite much about the environment and that we will have to really work on being better. Other thing that got my attention was her saying that we also have to work on the concept of "inclusion" of people (that was following after her saying that many people probably have a gap in the CV now etc.) maybe I'm exaggerating but this is kinda spooky, if you ask me and keep in mind things such as agenda 2030, when even things such as universal income are covered up with the topic of environment.. Maybe I'm crazy for seeing any connection, I don't know.
But setting that aside for now..</p>
<p>Yesterday on the New Year's Eve, me and my girlfriend went up to the forrest with a nice hill with plenty of space around to watch fireworks over the city. As we arrived there, there were a few people and many of them had a mask despite it being nature and plenty of open field. What happened next was some kids, probably around 10 yo, running around carelessly in masks, when they run probably around 3 meters away from us, suddenly their dad screamed at them high that they can't run so close to other people because we must keep great distance! He was probably all red from madness under that mask. I kinda laughed but later it hit me that there are plenty of people like that these days and that it's basically raising your children on constant fear. I think it's so ridiculous and sad. The next generation will be scared of literally everything, as if it's already not enough with all the people struggling from depression, anxiety, isolation without the virus in their growing up. Going through a lot myself, I really feel bad for how it's going to be for those people who are raised in these type of conditions now, being completely unaware of the world, being forced to wear a mask in the open while running and just being a kid AND ON TOP OF THAT hearing that you are still too near to others. Terrible.</p>
<p>I just needed to rant a bit, 1 to ease my anxiety and 2 because I really need to say that people are seriously sick in the head these days. Sometimes, I question myself if it's really not me that is part of the problem, but when I see things like I described, I think I'm fine.. Correct me, if I'm wrong. Trying to stay sane but honestly nothing makes sense to me anymore.</p></p>

        <p>Nothing makes sense to me anymore either. I haven't seen anything too crazy with people here in upstate NY, but it's possible you've heard about crazy Cuomo of NYC. Two weeks to flatten the curve, my ass. I work in the city and people are walking alone, driving alone, and biking around in masks. They are worn inside stores and restaurants. Lots of really asinine rules here just like everywhere else. I plan to get to my local park more next spring. I did nothing last year. I was too shaken up. I'm hoping the insanity isn't down here as much. I live a half hour outside of the city. Very small town.</p>
