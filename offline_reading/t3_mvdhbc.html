<p>this is so fucking crazy.<br>
I doubt anyone of the clowns supporting the new law have read it.<br>
or if they did, they didn't understand what it entails.<br>
I am livid.</p>
<p>this is the first time during the entire pandemic where I am truely afraid of whats to come.  </p>
<p>people say that these protesters walk alongside neo-nazis in order to difame them.<br>
then they turn arround and cheer in anticipation of the government passing a law that is completely fascistic.<br>
they are literally embracing what they formerly claimed to oppose. I am at a loss for words.</p>

        <p>if you can read german then just google "gesetztesentwurt infektionsschutzgesetz".<br>
if not, its basically a law that enables the government to lock people up in their houses or restrict other things depending on a manipulatable number. the number is delivered by a government institution and its not legally defined how that numbers is raised.</p>
<p>if not for the fact that it gives the government way too much liberty it should be that fact that a law based on an arbitrary and manipulatable number is fucking insane that should make you be heavily against it.</p>

        <p>I remember waaaay back at the beginning of this the idea was floated that of course there would be protest and pushback, but the government would blame them for covid spread to turn people against them.</p>
<p>They could create a situation where people blame their continued regional lockdowns on the protests.  "As long as people keep protesting, the region stays locked down.  You dont open up until the protests stop." basically.</p>
<p>I dont want to compare it to collective punishment strategies used against partisan resistance in wartime .. but i guess i just did.</p>

        <p>simply because its not their responsibility.<br>
they are free to protest.<br>
its not up to them to check who participates alongside with them.  </p>
<p>left leaning demonstrations have violence too. you still can't blame everyone participating in these demonstrations for the actions of a select few. its idiotic to suggest otherwise.<br>
media always frames it this way, I know, its still stupid and you should know better than to eat this propaganda up.</p>
<p>in the same way I could say that ANY german citizen is a neo-nazi supporter because they live in a land where neo-nazis exist.<br>
thissort of line of reasoning is I D I O T I C.<br>
its a commonly used tool to difame the opposition. its dumb that people still fall for it today, but then again, theres a reason its tried and true.</p>
<p>the woke mob thinks they got it all figured out when in reality they fall for the same stigmatizations of a group then people in the past did. the only difference is that they now believe they are on the right side of things.<br>
be better than that.</p>

        <p>It is there responsibility because they are walking side by side with them. You simply don't form alliances with neo-nazis anywhere. Should be common sense... And they all know there are neo-nazis and a lot of right wings from AfD, but they don't care. THESE ARE THE GUYS THAT LITERALLY WANT A DICTATURE AND THESE GUYS DEMONSTRATE WITH THEM AGAINST A ALLEGED DICTATURE. That's incredibly dumb.</p>

<p>no its not, no matter how often this is repeated (a common propaganda tactic aswell).  </p>

<p>this so called "alliance" is in your head and nowhere else.</p>

why would you have to actively distance yourself from something you never even approved off?</p>

It's not in my head, you just deny it to feel better. Look up some information about "Frank der Reisende". He's hosting most of the Querdenker Telegram channels and has obvious connections to neo-nazis and walked on their demonstrations.</p>

<p>stop being an idiot and think outside of your small box for once.<br>
you are being heavily influenced by the media.<br>
listen to arguments of both sides and then make up your mind.<br>
and no, I don't mean the argument of dumb people. which both sides have in abundance. Lauterbach and Drosten for example.</p>

<p>you only listen to the "educated folks" that tell you what you already believe. open up your mind and listen to everony on the field.<br>
Lauterbach for example isn't even in the field. his wife was. hes remotely affiliated. his opinions are horseraddish and were wrong multiple times in the past already. yet hes still paraded arround on television.</p>
<p>take Streeck. hes getting ridiculed online or on TV. and why? because hes not following the mainstream train of thought?</p>

        <p>It's the same thing with climate change. There is a scientific consensus, but there are people stating there isn't, what then gets shared from people wanting to distract from the facts (once again, AfD). Do you really think there is a global elite forcing almost every country to do sth. against Covid?</p>
<p>So many Querdenker*innen believe obvious lies like children dying from wearing masks. That's just nonsense... They are arguing with emotions not facts but when Lauterbach states sth. they talk about science? </p>
<p>Maybe Streeck gets ridiculed online, Lauterbach gets tons of messages threatening to kill him. What's worse?</p>

<p>no one said this lol. this is the typical straw man though. its one of the reasons its impossible to have a reasonable discussion.<br>
anyone against COVID measures is a nutjob, a conspiracy theorist, a science denier (even though world reknown scientists agree...), a grandma killer or a neo-nazi.<br>
the media has taught you well.  </p>
<p>think about what you learned in school about propaganda and how it works. apply it to now. its not hard to see a pattern here. opposition gets dehumanized. its so freaking apparent.<br>
we act like we got smarter, we really didn't.<br>
people like you are the proof.</p>
<p>&rt; So many ... believe obvious lies</p>
<p>like any prediction Lauterbach has made in the past. lies like that?<br>
or blatantly shifting of goalposts over and over when their old goalpost don't quite show how "urgent" things are? come on. you can't expect other people to be as dense as you.  </p>
<p>&rt; Lauterbach gets tons of messages threatening to kill him.</p>
<p>again. typical reaction. hes not a victim in this. he just gets the platform to pretend he is.</p>

        <p>"no one said this lol" That's exactly what Querdenker say...
 Look at Attila Hildmann who is one of the most famous people "criticizing" the politics. I know he's a trastic example, but the narrative is the same at KenFM et al.
Querdenken talks about a dictature and some compare themselves to Anne Frank or people in North Korea and that's a fact.</p>
<p>Do you believe Covid is real and what would you suggest if you think it is?</p>
<p>Surely Lauterbach is the victim of the threatening?
What of Lauterbachs predictions were lies?</p>

        <p>In germany these events are mentioned as "right-wing protest march" or "corona denier march". 
In german news, when something is a corona protest, or any protest against the narrative, they usually add "march" to frame it even more right-wing, because nazis are marching. Also sometimes they add "denier" (-leugner) which is higly associated with holocaust-denying. </p>

        <p>Back in August of last year when these were happening Antifa sent out messages telling people to stay away from the center of the city because "right-wing extremists, neonazis, and Covid deniers" were gathering and people, especiailly foreigners, should fear for their safety because they might get attacked.</p>
