    <strong>A Free Country</strong>
    <p><p>I feel like a lot of people (not exclusive to this subreddit, but certainly many in this subreddit) misunderstand, misuse, and frankly abuse the term ‚Äúfree country‚Äù. It seems to be a catch-all term to describe freedom of choice, when it is not. The ‚ÄúFree Country‚Äù allows one to exercise the rights stated in the 1st Amendment. It means that US citizens have the right to freely practice any religion, free to speak out against the government (in a non-threatening manner), free to gather peacefully, and a freedom of the press (mainly to exercise freedom to speak against the government. Therefore, the government is perfectly within its rights to require its citizens to get vaccinated, should it need to. The idea of a free country does not allow you to ignore such mandates - only protest them. </p>
<p>What are people‚Äôs thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>Totally agree. That was their vision for us, but why do we have to live by it? As society changes and things evolve, we should too. It‚Äôs not reasonable for us to put rules in place for future generations to live by having no idea what the world will be like then.</p>

        <p>Big difference between requiring people to wear seatbelts and helmets, banning the use of drugs, and Roe v Wade vs not wanting to take a vaccine. Additionally, did you read what Columbia Law School Outlined as bodily integrity? No mention of anything pertaining to vaccines.</p>

        <p>You are right. There is a significant difference, and it is a question that has been addressed in some capacity before. <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46745">Here is an article</a> discussing the topic. The state or the federal government could attempt to do this, but ramifications would alter society forever and would establish a precedent of public health authoritarianism that is rife for abuse. </p>
<p>I'm arguing from a human rights perspective. Informed consent and bodily integrity are human rights. Whether the government has the authority to brush aside these rights in the face of emergency is the calculus that they need to weigh. If you think that this emergency warrants such extreme measures, you should be aware of the permanent, and very real effects it will have on society and the relationship of the state to its people.</p>
<p>If I have natural antibodies, which are shown to be lifelong in multiple studies, should I be outcast from society and forced against my will to be vaccinated? </p>
<p>We are in a situation where the media has damned us to hyperbolic reactionary behaviors, and it is a question of human rights vs the power of the state. My hope is they will relent, but my mind knows otherwise.</p>

        <p>My freedom of choice tells me it's my choice. </p>
<p>It would be a different story if the government made enough information available to the public for actual informed consent. </p>
<p>They knew about the potential risks of the vaccine in early 2020, and they chose to withhold that from the public, to continue to push that it's safe for all. They mislead the public, regardless of the degree. </p>
<p>The narrative of the vaccine has changed, which seems to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Millions of people took the vaccine based on inaccurate information.</p>
<p>It went from, save your peers by getting vaccinated, it's the right thing to do. Which has been proven to be false, shown across the world.</p>
<p>It's been marketed as being safe for all, which again, has shown to be false across the world.</p>
<p>There are demographics that are statistically not at risk.</p>
<p>It's a trial.</p>
<p>So... No. I have absolutely every right to choose not to take it.</p>
