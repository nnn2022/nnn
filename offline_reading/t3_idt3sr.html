    <strong>Yes, you are being tracked via your cellphone. Governments have been doing it since the beginning, but it is (of course) getting worse.</strong>
    <p><p>They've been tracking people since the beginning by mapping activity on towers.</p>
<p>Governors would use that data to judge compliance with stay at home orders.</p>
<p>https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-tracking-how-people-move-around-in-coronavirus-pandemic-11585393202</p>
<p>https://www.hannapub.com/franklinsun/news/local_state_headlines/edwards-calls-for-more-contact-tracing-tracking-residents-movements-through-cell-phones/article_dbce1e8e-9144-11ea-a2c8-c3e448062a7c.html</p>
<p>&rt;States are also enacting “Contact Tracing” as the next step in battling the virus while scientists work toward a vaccine. Contact Tracing is using your cellphone to track your movements around people who may have tested positive for the virus. That alerts a Contact Tracer at a call center who must call you and the one who tested positive and then everyone else both of you may have been around. The call may trigger a 14-day quarantine for each person.</p>
<p>&rt;“We are looking to bring on 700 workers to work in call centers around the state of Louisiana,” said Edwards, “supervised by epidemiologists and trained. The information you get from testing is fed to contact tracers who start calling the person who tests positive to figure out the time period when that individual became contagious. This is so critical because as engage the economy and people become more mobile, there’s going to be more contact.”</p>
<p><strong>It recently got worse fairly recently, however, when google and apple slipped contact tracing apps into their phone oses.</strong></p>
<p>https://www.cnet.com/news/google-apple-contact-tracing-apps-for-covid-19-to-roll-out-in-us-in-coming-weeks/</p>
<p>https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/</p>
<p>Search through the settings on your phone and you will find it.</p>
<p>As usual, they promise that you do not have to worry about your privacy and that these new tracking protocols will not be abused. They promise.</p>
<p>You don't have to opt in to anything for them to track which towers you're bouncing off of when you travel, of course.</p>
<p>If the contact tracing app alerts the authorities that you were in contact with someone who tested positive for covid, or they assume is covid positive, they will likely request you to quarantine and then move on to tracing your network of friends and family from there.</p></p>

        <p>You can mitigate (but not fully prevent due to aforementioned tower triangulation) this by disabling location services, Google location accuracy, and WiFi/Bluetooth scanning in your system preferences.  Keep your WiFi and Bluetooth radios turned off when you don't actively need/use them, and be mindful of apps that force you to turn on location services for no good reason (looking at you, Postmates).</p>
<p>Not sure how to mitigate on iPhone.</p>
<p>The only way to completely stop it is with a layer-1 solution, which means you're going to need a Faraday bag.  That will block ALL signals to and from the phone, though, so you won't be able to receive calls or messages until you take your phone out.</p>

        <p>I put my phone on airplane mode and put it in a faraday bag, then leave it in my vehicle while I am in town.</p>
<p>But I am a nutter.</p>
<p>edit: for those interested, the reason i put it on airplane mode isn't necessarily for redundancy, but because the phone will overheat and also kill its battery trying to get a signal.</p>

        <p>Whyyyyy are people opting to be tested with mild or no symptoms? Unless you live with a true at-risk person and will require household arrangements, I don't see what the point is. If you require medical intervention, go get seen- at that point, they'll probably test. If not, why bother getting swabbed? People are constantly complaining about how uncomfortable the test is anyway...</p>

        <p>I agree.  I don't get it.</p>
<p>I've <em>yet</em> to get a satisfactory answer when I ask that question.</p>
<p>The most you're doing is getting a result, that may or may not be accurate, for a past point in time.</p>
<p>And then you're ratting out whoever you've been around and then inconveniencing their lives based on questionable, suspect data and state policy.</p>
<p>Asymptomatic people do not spread covid at any appreciable level.  If you don't feel bad don't waste your time or resources or that of others.</p>
