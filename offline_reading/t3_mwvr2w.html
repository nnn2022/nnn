    <strong>Email I got at my Government Job Yesterday</strong>
    <p><p>I thought this would be interesting to note for all us Canadians. I am a low level employee for a government agency which processes Canadian taxes (I am sure you can guess which agency) and I noticed something interesting in an email detailing new changes to the CRB. </p>
<p>The email said something like," cerb payments will be going down to $300 weekly as of July 17th as the economy FULLY reopens over the summer."</p>
<p>I was very surprised by that seeing as restrictions have become really brutal last week in some provinces and it seems like this summer would have very little freedom. What is their plan? Does this agency really know what the greater outcome will be among government policies? Are they just running out of money for the plebs? Do they expect to boost the economy by allowing it to fully open over the summer so that people will survive another winter locked down?</p></p>
