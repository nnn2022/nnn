        <p>Okay so so far WHO, epidemiologists, scientists, virologists, scientists, doctors, nurses, surgeons, news companies, your national health organisation, your local GP, your health secretary or minister, your current president, millions of people, world leaders, medical researchers, people who study diseases and worldwide charities all say the virus is real. To add on to that, why would people fake something that has decreased the global economy by 2% , caused a housing crisis and a financial crisis. The government has lost money and members due to this. There are literally patients fighting for their life in hospital. Also, if it is faked why are their so much extensive resources? The government would certainly not fake something that requires them to put in full manpower and millions of their currency into building hospitals at full speed. So if you call the government greedy and completely and blatantly ignore the economic catastrophe the government has had the deal with, then think that way and don’t get mad when you get socially valued as a complete and utter moron. 
And also, about ‘individual rights’. The fact that you ignore human trafficking, slavery, deprivation from human necessities and the fact that people are forced to work for 1 dollar an hour in sweatshops, which by the way, are all currently happening at this moment somewhere in the world, and call getting asked to stay indoors and tie a bit of fabric around your face in a first world country with freedom of speech and  infinite access to all necessities and luxuries a violation of rights just makes you sound more of a moron. No matter how much scientific evidence there is, you will never accept them and just defend your idiotic logic with your made up science that sounds like something a 3 year old would make up shows how ridiculously stubborn you are or if your tiny brain is too full up with random Facebook ‘knowledge’ too even learn anything new. So, if a surgeon can wear 2 masks 7 years straight for 22 hour shifts 7 days a week, you can wear one to go to Walmart for half an hour. We live in the most advanced era so far. We don’t need to kill anyone to stop a virus. All you need to do is stay indoors and tie fabric round your face to save millions of lives. Anyway, what evidence is their that COVID doesn’t exist or masks are bad? Why don’t you go compare your tiny bit of information that has been debunked 1000 times and was written by someone who has the same brain - functioning ability as a carrot against the thousands of scientific documents written by absolute geniuses who have had many years of medical experience. The fact we have to debunk papers on why COVID isn’t real is sad. The fact that you believe in it is more depressing.</p>

<p>Few people deny covid exists, it's that it's not the bogeyman purported to be., </p>
<p>&rt;Also, if it is faked why are their so much extensive resources?</p>
<p>It's called 'sunk cost' along with significant lobbying pressure from corporate interests that has led to the largest wealth transfer in history. 
&rt;or masks are bad?</p>
<p>The literal majority of policy grade evidence.</p>

        <p>Few people deny COVID exists because few people have that incredibly low amount of brain cells. Still doesn’t explain why the government would apparently fake something that has cost them millions and a 2% loss in economy. Show me some then.</p>

        <p>Most people although they may be adults never mature beyond the infant stage.  For these people the government fulfills the role their parents used to play.  They truly believe in spite of all the evidence otherwise that the government has their best interests in mind and it's there to protect them and keep them safe.  </p>
<p>So they live their lives in a perpetual unthinking dopamine pleasure circuit feedback loop, continually satisfying their oral, anal and sexual circuitry as they've been programmed primarily by media and advertisements.  The powers that be are very aware of this and use it to their advantage to keep the majority of the population unaware of their slavery.</p>
