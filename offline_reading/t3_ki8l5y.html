    <strong>I may lose my best friend over the mask debate</strong>
    <p><p>Which is truly sad as we’ve been friends since we were kids, even through moving and long distance. At first she admitted she didn’t know much about politics. Lately she’s been watching more and more of the news it seems and the propaganda on TikTok. She’s starting sharing more and more about our duty to “wear a mask” for the sake of others. </p>
<p>When the vaccine first came out, I was sending her links of it being dangerous for breastfeeding mothers, etc which just turned into a debate about how it’s safe because the experts say so and etc. I left it alone and said we can agree to disagree, because I value our friendship. She has a close family member who was just diagnosed with cancer, so now I feel that she thinks I’m just a menace to society and putting others in danger, outside of the facts. </p>
<p>We live far apart but usually text everyday, my last text to her was about the new gym I started.  She didn’t respond for several days but was sharing propaganda and just now texted “Do you wear a mask??”</p>
<p>Like now I feel like I can’t be my honest self with her because her emotions are too into it.  Our relationship will from now on revolve around if I’m “doing the right thing”</p>
<p>The No New Normal is so damaging. This just fuels my hate for it.</p></p>

        <p>Listen man, last night I had a friend talking to me about how they're essentially losing everything.</p>
<p>The conversation was made up of them explaining how they lost their job over the pandemic (but found a new one), lost their GF, and how life has kind of sucked.</p>
<p>I explained - Don't worry man! You're young and in good health. You've got almost 100% chance of surviving it. The masks don't even do much anyway. Look at states with no mask mandates, some cases are lower than those of really strict states.</p>
<p>It wasn't meant to piss him off, rather let him know he can only do so much before blaming himself (Was afraid of getting his parents sick) and maybe planting a seed.</p>
<p>Well, the very next response was "Lol Im not debating over this. anyway, did you see the new starwars series?"</p>
<p>....And that told me all I need to know. I like videogames, and some films, I like all that stuff - but this can no longer be entertained. This total and utter willful ignorance. You will find it in more people than in not.</p>

        <p>If you have to lie and self censor to maintain a friendship it’s not worth it.</p>
<p>Further, you can’t really be friends with people you disagree with politically. I know that’s a troubling statement but I’ll go on.</p>
<p>Let’s say you enjoy guns and you have a friend that is pro gun control. What does that mean?</p>
<p>You may think “well that just means we disagree on guns but, whatever right? We can still grab lunch and hang out and watch movies”. But you’re not really thinking about it.</p>
<p>If he wants you to lose your guns and you want to keep them then the difference is that he supports men coming to your house with guns to take your property by force even if that means your death.</p>
<p>You can’t be friends with that. And the same goes for this masking lockdown thing. If someone is pro masking and lockdowns and you aren’t they are telling you that they support your submission to government power over your own freedom and liberty. They are saying that you are less important than other people and should go against your own beliefs and pretend to be sick to make everyone feel safe even if it damages your way of life. You can’t be friends with that.</p>
<p>I’m sorry.</p>

        <p>It took me so long to realize this. Thought maybe I was being a total stubborn hard ass (which I tend to be about topics I’m very passionate about) but now I realize no. How the hell is it okay that people let alone friends want to take my rights away. My right to work, my right to pay my bills, my right to wear what I want, my right to choose what I put into my body. In the beginning of the pandemic I was trying to meet friends in the middle but I am fucking done. ￼￼ The funny thing is is I have made many more friends through this who have the ability to think critically, so ultimately I’m grateful. ￼but I agree with you, you can’t be friends with someone, REAL friends at least, if they disagree politically with you.</p>

        <p>It’s funny how leftists are so much better than us at this too. I had one friend completely cut me off, not because I was voting for trump they knew I wasn’t voting at all. But because I read trumps book before he was elected.</p>
<p>They were like “oh he read trumps book and didn’t disagree, That’s not someone I can entertain being around.”</p>
<p>Had another do it to me when she started saying “vagina having person”. We were going to a health club and she said “I forgot to bring feminine products, I hope there is a vagina having person there I can bum one off of”. I questioned her and she said. “Not all women have vaginas.”  I just said that was silly and nothing else.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the day hanging out with no issue and then she never spoke to me again. This was a several year long friendship. Gone.</p>
<p>I think there is something about such people where there is just no sentimentality.</p>

        <p>"Agree to disagree" has been the conclusion of the last 4-5 conversations I've had with my best friend. Once you've been labeled or judged by a friend as something you're not, and you're not able to get through to them, it may be time to finish the discussion.</p>

        <p>its just crazy how out of bounds mentally it is to consider some of the policies mistakes, bad group think, sunk cost continuances, and worst case lies to push through non democratic societal changes.   We aren’t talking ancient aliens, but its literally not crossing the minds of most if not all friends.  Sure, “trump lies all the time” but somehow not oily ol’ fauci, or birx, or any of the democrat leaders we have stacked in our western blue state institutions.</p>

        <p>You can only tell her to stop asking if you're bothered by it.  </p>
<p>If she refuses, then to be frank you have to be direct and have a spine. She either stops talking about the current situation with you, because you both have irreconcilable differences, or you actively stop being friends with her.   </p>
<p>Don't be the kind of person who clings onto someone out of hope. If she can't respect your want to agree to disagree then walk away.</p>

        <p>Depends on whether you want a real relationship or not. Their views are not more deserving of respect than your own. I've lost a friend because of a similar issue. Yeah, it sucks, but it's a blessing in disguise. Even before all of this madness, friendships sometimes disintegrated  when new information about a party's character was revealed. We are learning a lot about eachother these days and it's just getting started.</p>

        <p>Yep. He wants to be friends with her. There really are only three options here:  </p>
<p>nod and keep your mouth shut,  tell her to stop talking about it (and mean it), or stop talking to her entirely.   </p>
<p>OP wants to stay friends, and the most effective solution for that would be to just play along with her. If it really bothers him then he must be willing to tell her to stop and agree to disagree.</p>

        <p>Well sure, I guess it's a matter of priorities. I guess I prioritize integrity which precludes "playing along", at least in regards to important matters.</p>
