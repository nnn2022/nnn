    <strong>Are we really supposed to believe that people were actually on "lockdown" and quarentined for a whole year ?</strong>
    <p><p>Other than maybe the elite and celebrity types, I don't know anyone that had the luxury of actually being holed up in their home for the last year or more. Saying you were on lockdown or quarentining/isolating sounds like a cool thing to say but does anyone here actually know anyone that did it, or are those people all full of bullshit?</p></p>

        <p>I believe it, inside I just think it‚Äôs a bit pitiful. I explored so many new beautiful places during 2020 ‚Äúquarantine,‚Äù and enjoyed dining and recreation in more rural coastal towns that hadn‚Äôt been hit by COVID or strict mandates.</p>

        <p>LOL- I‚Äôve never heard ‚ÄúCommifornia‚Äù but for the most part people are reasonable about virus safety - masks on in crowded places, not by the beach or in the park, many less masks on average now that case numbers are way down.</p>

        <p>I think there definitely people who stayed home most of the year (my Nextdoor neighbors for example. Two young teachers and they had a baby in September or October. Other than a ‚Äúdrive by baby shower‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt even see them outside until 2021. They never had anyone over either). But I think most people who claim they stayed in for a year are lying virtue signalers! It‚Äôs no different than the ‚Äústay the fuck home‚Äù crowd who constantly yelled at people who were out doing normal things. Almost all of them were engaging in the same activities, they all had at least one thing they decided was important enough to break the rules over. My gosh I remember one of my moms close friends losing her mind over the fact that PARKS would be open on Easter weekend! Saw her all over local FB news pages feigning outrage and calling on the local elected officials to do something! Same thing with beaches, when people started going to the beach because literally nothing was open here, she and others lost their shit. She wasn‚Äôt the only Karen outraged over this either and all parks and beaches ended up closed over the Easter weekend. And beaches were closed several times during the spring and summer. Anyway‚Ä¶..right after Easter she started going to the beach or local hiking spots every weekend and posted pictures on FB like a true hypocrite virtue signaler! She even traveled to a neighboring county lots of times and posted about it on FB. Yet she insisted everyone else stay the fuck home and take this seriously!</p>

        <p>I haven't changed a thing in my life. Other than my employer requiring a mask nothing has changed. Most restaurants remained open in some capacity. And I rarely go out to eat. I'd say the only thing I've missed is big concerts.</p>

        <p>If you work a corporate job it was definitely easy to not go outside at all. I was against lockdowns and all the bullshit but I stayed home a lot of the time anyway because there was nothing to do and the weather was utter shit until 2 weeks ago. Yeah it was depressing.</p>
