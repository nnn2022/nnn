        <p>I always suggest people look at Sweden's experience with this virus.  They never locked down, never forced "non-essential" businesses to close, never implemented any ridiculous mask mandates, and never closed schools for children under 16.  And the virus has now pretty clearly burned itself out there. Remember "flatten the curve"? Well, that's because epidemics follow a curve, and Sweden appears to be almost completely through its curve.  </p>
<p>https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/daily-covid-deaths-per-million-7-day-average?country=~SWE</p>
<p>The results?</p>
<p>Sweden, a country of 10.1 million people, in which annual all-cause mortality is around 93,000, is reporting a total of 5,763 "COVID-19 deaths" (using a <em>very</em> broad counting standard in which anyone who dies within 30 days of a positive test is counted as a "COVID-19 death," irrespective of the actual cause of death).  Of those 5,763 "COVID-19 deaths":</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Almost 90% (89%) were over the age of 70</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Over two-thirds</em> (67.6%) were over the age of <em>80</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 71 deaths (1.2%) were individuals under the age of 50</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only 1 death was an individual under the age of 20</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1107913/number-of-coronavirus-deaths-in-sweden-by-age-groups/">Source</a>.</p>
<p>Sweden's death rate is actually <em>better</em> than than that of US when you account for the fact that Sweden has a significantly larger elderly population (20% of Sweden's population is 65+ vs. only around 15% in the US). And Sweden will only look better over time compared to the US since Sweden is further along its curve. The US is still seeing significant deaths in parts of the country whereas Sweden's daily deaths have dropped to almost zero.</p>
<p>Here's the bottom-line reality:</p>
<ol>
<li>The disease burden of this virus is, in the grand scheme of things that cause death and human suffering, relatively mild, certainly that‚Äôs true when comparing it to the annual disease burden of leading killers like heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injury.</li>
<li>Lockdowns, school closures, mask mandates, and all the various other absurd measures that have been taken by many governments will do <em>almost nothing</em> to reduce the ultimate size of that disease burden.</li>
<li>However, those measures <em>will</em> do (and indeed have already done) a <em>mind-boggling</em> amount of damage: economic damage, damage to mental and physical health, damage to social trust and community, damage to our most fundamental liberties, and damage to the quality and enjoyment of hundreds of millions of people‚Äôs personal, professional, social, and educational lives. </li>
</ol>
<p>As I saw someone else put it: "we burned down our house to kill a spider, and we didn't even kill the spider."</p>

        <p>I also want to add to this great write-up that Sweden‚Äôs total mortality at this point of the year is completely average when you compare it to previous years. So it very much appears the virus killed those who would have died anyway or were on ‚Äúborrowed time‚Äù from having a mild 2018-19 flu season. </p>
<p>All this while people are not missing nearly as many cancer screenings and other vital preventative care in Sweden that will cause deaths to continue to rise in other countries that locked down.</p>

        <p>Also that anyone who died within 30 days a positive test was deemed a covid death, regardless of their cause of death. At least that happened for a significant period of time, unsure if it changed.</p>

        <p>What you forget to acknowledge, is Sweden already had a social distancing, reserved population.  They don't hang out in crowds like the US does, their restaurants and bars are not crowded like the US,  their health system was sized per capita appropriately unlike the US, and their population density is not like NYC, Chicago, LA, etc.</p>
<p>Apples to oranges, and to pretend otherwise is sticking your head in the sand.</p>

        <p>Maybe you and your family behave like Americans when you visit.  Their culture definitely isn't like American culture, and they absolutely are more reserved.  Please don't try to push a false narrative. To use the population density of the entire country as a comparison is completely irrelevant.  I've said multiple times that the response in the US should have been localized.  Small towns in Wyoming should not have the same mandates as NYC.  The numbers from the cities have an outsize effect making the entire country look bad.</p>
<p>If you feel it is fair to compare Sweden to the US, then you have to be willing to give up the argument that socialized medicine can't work in the US (as compared to, say, Sweden), because "their population is only 1/30th, and their cultures are different."  You can't have it both ways.  And I apologize if I am falsely assuming you are against socialized medicine, however the typical leaning of people in the crowd are libertarian and right.  With the few leaning left, and a few more pretending to lean left in an attempt to distract from their "muh rights" arguments.</p>

<p>My family are not American. My family are from various countries in Europe including Sweeden - also from Africa. My family who live there? They <em>are</em> Swedish. So I think they know better than you do, and I think <em>I</em> having spent large amounts of time there during my childhood and adult years among <em>locals</em> and actually witnessing life there, know better than you do. ü§£</p>
<p>Oh and I'm from a country with universal healthcare. Healthcare is free for everyone. Don't know what makes you think I'm against it, or against my friend's and few family members who live in America (2 family members moved there) having the same access to healthcare? </p>
<p>And don't you dare disregard the arguments against lockdown with your little dig at "muh rights" while enormous disproportionate harm is being done. Feel free to throw <em>your</em> rights away but rights are sort of just a bit important .</p>

        <p>It's temporary.  Unless you have evidence to support that we're still wearing masks from the 1918 flu, which was 50x worse.  That's why I absolutely dare to disregard the argument "muh rights".  It was temporary in 1918, and it's temporary now.  Your "rights" will be restored. </p>
<p>You're absolutely lying if you continue to maintain that swedish culture is significantly similar to US culture in ways that would affect spreading of the virus.</p>

        <p>I work for a hospital, and my wife worked in the designated COVID unit at her hospital for the first two months.  I do have an idea of the damage.  And refusing to wear masks and social distance will only prolong the harm.  Trying to pretend like Sweden "got it right" <em>and</em> their model would be applicable in the US is absurd.  And saying the "rights" you no longer have is <em>not</em> temporary is what I have a problem with.  When I say this is temporary - I'm saying the lockdown and mask mandates are temporary.  You foolish people who whine about "muh rights" are the ones prolonging it, and you'll be on the wrong side of history.</p>

        <p>I was clearly saying the consequences and disproportionate harms of lockdown are NOT temporary. Those consequences include deaths short and long-term, including deaths that have already happened as a consequence. </p>
<p>I don't particularly care for your claim of your wife working in a Covid unit. Dont care if it's true or not. Does not strengthen your argument which is not based in evidence in the slightest. How exactly do you think America has handled pandemics in the past? Not with lockdowns which were <em>never</em> evidence-based. Lockdowns which evidently have not even protected those actually at risk. Lockdowns which do MORE harm than anything else, to <em>everyone</em>. Masks aren't supported by high level evidence so, lol.</p>
<p>You're the ones prolonging the pain and harm by continuing lockdowns and silly restrictions not based in science at all.</p>

        <p>As I've stated before, I don't believe a one size fits all model can work.  There were areas that should have had a lockdown and mask mandates, and others where it was mostly unnecessary.  As an example, my wife had to watch several people die alone because her hospital wouldn't allow visitors even to say goodbye to loved ones. Unfortunately, we just didn't know enough about the virus at that point.</p>
<p>However, to say there is no evidence that lockdowns and masks work, maybe review this data.  And note where Sweden falls vs, say, Singapore and Japan.  (Per capita numbers)</p>

        <p>&rt;In August, Sweden has registered just one death (!) with/from the coronavirus. Yes, you read that correctly. One death so far. </p>
<p>&rt;For the month of July, Sweden reported 226 deaths. They‚Äôve accounted for 805 June deaths, 1646 in May, and 2572 in April. The deaths attributed to COVID-19 went from about a 50% reduction to falling off of a cliff.</p>
<p>That's the bottom line folks. It will burn through society like a fire until it burns out. All we're doing is drawing out how long the fire burns instead of getting it over with quickly like Sweden. Remember in April how the media had articles every week about how awful Sweden is? They're not talking about it anymore. Meanwhile, the virus is coming back in all the countries that locked down. This is madness.</p>

        <p>Odd, this is the story I read recently:</p>
<p>Sweden Has Become the World‚Äôs Cautionary Tale. </p>
<p>(Excerpt from NYT July 7, 202O)</p>
<p>Ever since the coronavirus emerged in Europe, Sweden has captured international attention by conducting an unorthodox, open-air experiment. It has allowed the world to examine what happens in a pandemic when a government allows life to carry on largely unhindered.</p>
<p>This is what has happened: Not only have thousands more people died than in neighboring countries that imposed lockdowns, but Sweden‚Äôs economy has fared little better.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey literally gained nothing,‚Äù said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a self-inflicted wound, and they have no economic gains.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Most of the info is presented in The NY Times article, though I did look at a couple of other sources.</p>
<p>Sweden‚Äôs economy was in better shape than most countries in the first quarter, but it quickly caught up with the rest of the world.   There are a lot of ways of measuring economic health, but this sums it up pretty well:</p>
<p>‚Äúvarious forecasts predict the Swedish economy will still shrink by about 5% this year. That's less than other countries hit hard by Covid-19 such as Italy, Spain and the UK, but still similar to the rest of Scandinavia. Sweden's unemployment rate of 9% remains the highest in the Nordics, up from 7.1% in March.‚Äù</p>
<p>This makes sense if you think about it.  Sweden‚Äôs economy depends on international sales, and global sales have been way down.  As for domestic economics, it‚Äôs the virus that causes the slowdown, not regulations.   Swedes stopped going to malls and shopping centers to avoid getting ill, even without regulation.  </p>
<p>Of course, if Sweden had the same economic downturn and equal or better health results without masks, etc. that would be a real statement about those health measures.   But Sweden‚Äôs health results are much worse, shockingly high:</p>
<p>From The NY Times: </p>
<p>‚ÄúPer million people, Sweden has suffered 40 percent more deaths than the United States, 12 times more than Norway, seven times more than Finland and six times more than Denmark.‚Äù  </p>
<p>That surprised me, so I looked up global deaths, and sure enough, it‚Äôs that bad.   Here‚Äôs a link to a chart using data from Sweden, USA, Europe, and Nordic countries:</p>
<p>https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&amp;country=SWE~NOR~DNK~FIN~USA~Europe&amp;deathsMetric=true&amp;interval=total&amp;aligned=true&amp;perCapita=true&amp;smoothing=0&amp;pickerMetric=location&amp;pickerSort=asc</p>

        <p>This opinion piece was wrong, Swedens deaths are going down - about 1-3 deaths per day now.There is almost no point in comparing reported Coronadeaths between countries since all count differently. You need to look at excess deaths instead.Sweden has LESS excess deaths than reported Coronadeaths. The US has about 60 000 MORE deaths than reported.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/12/us/covid-deaths-us.html">Source</a></p>
<p>This means that the US is doing alot worse than Sweden. </p>
<p>Their GDP is down about 8,5 %, average in europe is about 11,5%. UK is down about 20%.</p>
<p>Anyway Sweden choose to not make a forced lockdown because the agency responsible thought it would cause more suffering in the long run. It was not to save the economy, the Public Health agency is not responsible for the economy, they dont care about the economy. They are however responsible for public health in a broad sense, they can not only focus on the coronavirus.</p>

        <p>Why do people keep comparing Sweden only to their nordic neighbours, they are not the same, you do know that right? </p>
<p>Fact is that Sweden did better than some countries and worse than others. What it didnt do was put their   citizens in housearrest (there is a reason its consider a punishment) , not allowing children to play outside for months, having the police arrest people for talking a walk etc</p>
<p>Fact is that Sweden did better than some countries and worse than others. Sweden did a lot to stop the virus. What it didnt do was put their   citizens in housearrest (there is a reason its consider a punishment) , not allowing children to play outside for months, having the police arrest people for exercising outside etc</p>
<p>Sweden used carrots instead of sticks and treated their citizens like responsible adults. </p>
<p>Perhaps some day we will know which strategy was the best but right now the US is having about ten times as many deaths per capita per day adding to their already much higher per capita deaths.</p>

        <p>I just posted in a separate reply a link to a pic of a chart comparing total deaths per million people in Sweden with other Nordic countries and the US. (<a href="https://imgur.com/xSnpOO8">https://imgur.com/xSnpOO8</a> ) The US is an outlier, and it's health care system, etc are different enough from Sweden and the other Nordic countries, so I'm going to limit my comments to the Nordic countries.  This are the total COVID deaths per capita in those countries:</p>
<p>Sweden, 576.28; Denmark, 107.56; Finland, 60.46; Norway, 48.7; Iceland, 29.3.</p>
<p>Sweden had over 5 times the per capita number of deaths than in Denmark, the country with the next highest rate, and 9 times the average of the the other Nordic countries.</p>
<p>This thread is about a claim the Sweden's COVID policies had categorically better results fighting COVID.  I understand there may be arguments such as differences in health care system and excess deaths that might result in an adjustment, but I'd be surprised if any reasonable adjustment could explain why per capita deaths in Sweden from COVID have been so much higher than the average of other Nordic countries.  It's unreasonable to say that Sweden's results are much better than those countries.</p>
<p>According to CNN, Sweden has reported highest death tally in 150 years in first half of 2020. (Sweden experienced a famine in 1867).  My argument doesn't rest of the specifics of total excess deaths, but it's relevant.   <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/20/europe/sweden-deaths-highest-coronavirus-lockdown-intl/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/20/europe/sweden-deaths-highest-coronavirus-lockdown-intl/index.html</a></p>

<p>The picture I linked to in my reply comes from this graph, which is updated regularly:</p>

        <p>The nordic countries is not the same, so its irrelevant to compare Sweden only to those countries. I honestly dont know why people insist on comparing them.</p>
<p>You might aswell compare the Netherlands only to Belgium or the US only to Canada. </p>
<p>"According to CNN, Sweden has reported highest death tally in 150 year in first half of 2020. (Sweden experienced a famine in 1867).  My argument doesn't rest of the specifics of total excess deaths, but it's relevant."</p>
<p>Adjusted for inhabitants you only have to go back about 10 years to find higher excessdeaths. Anyway you will see that If you compare corona deaths to excess death this year Sweden is actually reporting to many corona deaths, lots of other countries (Spain, Italy, the UK, US, the netherlands etc) are reporting to few corona deaths.</p>
<p>Making Sweden more successfull than what it looks like.</p>

        <p>If most Americans could be trusted to socially distance and act responsibly then the Sweden model would work in the US. The problem is Americans do not have the mentality of the ‚Äúgreater good‚Äù like the Nordic countries do so it would never have worked.  Americans care about themselves too much to see the bigger picture.</p>

        <p>Is it more serious than the 400,000 Americans who die from smoking-related illnesses every year (including 40,000 innocent people who die from second-hand smoke)?</p>
<p>More serious than the 300,000 Americans who die from obesity every year? </p>
<p>Both those numbers are much much higher than COVID deaths by the way.</p>
<p>So why don't you give a shit about those lives? After all, "lives are on the line" - a lot more than COVID.</p>

        <p>I think you came up with a conclusion rather quick.  I am not insinuating that covid deaths are the only things that matter.  </p>
<p>People are dying from covid and there is a way to decrease the likelihood of someone getting covid.</p>
<p>I would say your examples are serious however mainly caused by the individual themselves.  People choose to smoke, people choose to eat unhealthy.  There are initiatives trying to fix these issues as well, however, it seems to be at a slow pace.</p>
