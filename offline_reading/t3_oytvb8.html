    <strong>My conversation with a doomer blaming the non-vaccinated for restrictions</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, here's a little conversation to share with you guys. There's this doomer that created a thread in the Covidiots sub ranting against those who refuse to take the Covid vaccine. Here is my initial reply:</p>
<p>"The vaccine doesn't prevent infection or transmission, you know. So, why shame people who don't get the vaccine? Vaccinated people can spread the virus as easily as the non-vaccinated. Whatever happened to human rights and freedom?</p>
<p>Therefor, there is nothing selfish about not getting the vaccine. The only one being selfish is you."</p>
<p><strong>His reply</strong>: "Correct. It prevents you from being affected by the virus, or at least makes the symptoms extremely mild in almost all cases. Let’s please stop pretending that the vaccine is useless.</p>
<p>It’s selfish to not take it because you’re making the pandemic continue when it could’ve been over for months already. I’m tired of living in the stupid Covid limbo."</p>
<p><strong>My reply</strong>: "No, it doesn't prevent infection. That means it doesn't prevent transmission either. It's only supposed to reduce symptoms. Even the CDC themselves have admitted this. It's common knowledge at this point.</p>
<p>The vaccinated can spread it as easily as the un-vaccinated.</p>
<p>And besides, the vaccine makers aren't responsible for any adverse effects someone may experience? There's no recourse. So, why should it be our responsibility to take it? It's so backwards.</p>
<p>Look, I want out of this pandemic too, but with or without the vaccine, there's no getting out of it any time soon."</p>
<p><strong>His reply</strong>: "It prevents people from getting severe symptoms and dying, which is what we need to get rid of the restrictions. If everyone that was able to got it, there wouldn’t be overflowing hospitals and we could be done with the restrictions for good."</p>
<p><strong>My reply</strong>: "This vaccine only affects the person who gets it though. Even then, it's not a guarantee it'll prevent hospitalization and death. I wish for no more restrictions too, but mass vaccinations won't change that. Look at Iceland. It has a high vaccination rate, yet restrictions are starting up there again.</p>
<p>The point is, you are blaming the wrong people."</p>
<p><strong>His reply</strong>: "Right, if everyone got it, then everyone would be getting lesser symptoms, and we wouldn’t be having to keep restrictions to keep cases down. And yes, there are still people who have severe problems with Covid and even die despite being vaccinated, but it is extremely rare."</p>
<p><strong>My reply</strong>: "Still, you should be blaming the government for these restrictions. Vaccination is an individual choice. There's several valid reasons to not get vaccinated. Like if you've already had Covid, which gives you natural anti-bodies. Or if you're scared of the side-effects. The vaccine is experimental, and potential long-terms effects are still unknown. Some people experience horrific effects from it too. And remember, there's no recourse in any such event.</p>
<p>The vaccine is not the end-all, be-all. If you want to take the vaccine, take it. But don't expect everyone else to take it."</p>
<p>And that was the last of the conversation. 8 hours later, there's been no more replies. Now for some things to touch upon:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He's clearly wrong in his first reply, and I point this out later on. The virus is still spreading in highly vaccinated areas of the world. It doesn't matter how many people are vaccinated, the pandemic would still be going on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I don't get his second reply. He says it prevents people from getting severe symptoms or dying (we know that's not really the case, but I don't go too much into that, since he wouldn't understand), but that's an individual choice then. If we are only hurting ourselves in not taking this, then what sense does it make in having these restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And for his third reply, it's literally IMPOSSIBLE for everyone to take the vaccine. Beyond just the children and the immunocompromised people that can't it, there's tons of people not getting it for some very valid reasons, as I highlight in my next reply. He doesn't even address the Iceland issue I brought up. Like, what does he really think cases in Iceland will only stop if absolutely everyone there took the vaccine?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It seems he had nothing else to say after my last reply. Do you guys get into any similar conversations? If there anything else I should have touched upon?</p></p>

        <p>You don't get it dude. They <em>can't</em> be wrong about this. They literally injected an experimental technology into their bodies to get out of this mess. They have been psychologically abused just like us and everyone else.</p>

        <p>Normally, I don't even bother debating with these people. But I just feel I couldn't ignore it this time, because the way he was slamming down us "anti-vaxxers" made me sick.</p>

        <p>This is a hard one to swallow but think of the average human and you picture some done probably not so intelligent. Now realize that there are 50% of the people who fall below the average who are in fact dumber than the average person. It’s impossible to have a rational discussion with two contrasting views with someone who is too dumb to process rational counterpoints.</p>
