    <strong>If the majority of the populace are complying by wearing masks (to which they are) then why are the small minority labelled murderers and super-spreaders for not wearing one?</strong>
    <p><p><strong>Since masks, things have worsened.</strong></p>
<p>If you did probability in primary school, you'll understand that the chance of anti-maskers being responsible for the death of thousands (if you trust the figures) is extremely slim.</p>
<p>How about this for good measure. Masks do not work. Why? People re-use them. People constantly taking them off their face and putting them back on. It would be better for the spread if we didn't wear masks at all.</p>
<p>When Fauci told us not to wear masks at the beginning of the pandemic, his reasoning was absolutely correct. And it still is.</p></p>

        <p>Fauci says whatever they want him to say now, he knows it means he can keep his cosy job as a  technocrat and continue to be hero worshipped and fawned over by the media. Soon enough it's going to be 2, then 3, then "however many you can fit on your face".</p>

        <p>This is always something that's been so ridiculous to me. The vast majority of people wear masks, and the notion that this very small minority of people who don't comply with all the mandatds are the sole reason that this virus is still around, is absolutely silly.</p>
<p>The real issue the people with that mindset should have is with the massrs of people who go out and live their lives with a dirty old piece of cloth on their face, thinking they're some kind of angel who's protected. Most people wear a mask improperly, touch it incessantly, store it improperly, and/or don't wear a quality that's truly effective. In many cases, that's even worse than no mask at all. But wearing the dirty old piece of cloth on your face makes you a selfless saint, and not wearing one makes you a selfish and terribld grandma killer.</p>
<p>It's been nearly a year now, and all these mask mandates clearly haven't worked, yet are still pushed like they'll do something. If the real issue is people not complying (it's not), then what makes you think that people are suddenly going to start complying now? Definition of insanity, and all that.</p>
<p>And acting like these mask mandates are the cure-all for this virus is ridiculous. If that were the case, California and Europe wouldn't be getting shafted.</p>

        <p>Masks aren't a cure-all.  Not even close.  No one with any real intelligence has ever said that.  Masks are just a means to help lower the spread.   When combined with social distancing and staying the fuck out of mass gatherings (which a certain group of people seem to inept to do) it will certainly lower the rate of infection.</p>
<p>If you think this is wrong than why the  hell is the US the laughing stock of the world when others seem to manage this better?</p>

        <p>There's people nearly every day who come to the sub and make posts shouting about how we're all terrible people, and if everyone just wore a mask, this would all be over. You see a lot of posts on other subs saying the same thing. Maybe it's not necessarily a common view, but it's certainly not a rare one. Funny enough, I was discussing masks earlier today with someone who said this would all be over if we'd all just wear masks for two weeks.</p>
<p>Sure, masks, distancing, and not gathering in mass numbers will help lower the rate of infection. Will also help lower the death toll as well. But so will locking down the entire country for months on end, amongst many other measures. Doesn't mean it's a good idea, and there aren't real consequences for taking these measures. Just like anything that has the potential to kill - protect the vulnerable and take personal precautions if it's something you're afraid of, without going off the deep end.</p>
<p>So even though I agree with what you're saying, I still highly disagree that the US is the laughing stock of the world. First off, the US is quite powerful and influential, so it's often quite a popular and trendy thing for others to try and shit on it for anything it does. Particularly since there more Americans with anti-American feelings now more than ever. So I don't doubt that there are plenty of people more than willing to jump on us. The US is SO unlike any other country, it's quite difficult to outright say that we've definitively done better or worse than another country, but I'd say it's been handled well enough, all things considered - particularly when you look at how other regions of the world are doing with the measures they've taken. I'd have liked things to remain more open, and have government mandating things less often, but that's just me.</p>

        <p>And yet the narrative has shifted to MASK HARDER. Countries mandating N-95 masks and suggesting 2-3 masks instead of 1.</p>

        <p>Weren't they saying 1 mask only gives a very small percentage of protection? And three masks only gives like 75%? Clearly the answer is either four masks or a plastic bag.</p>

        <p>Saw a dude in Walmart with a visibly dirty mask. Like with brown spots all over it. I do not understand how that is better than not wearing one at all. How do you put that on and think it’s a good idea. Yet I’m looked at like the crazy one.</p>

        <p>Stockholm syndrome on a national scale. What we have here is a populace held captive by the government, with a gun to their head. And instead of thinking the government is wrong for doing this, they're shouting at the police (us in this metaphor) to just "give him what he wants so he'll go away".</p>
