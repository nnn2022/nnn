    <strong>How to Make Pro-Lockdowners Question Their Beliefs</strong>
    <p><p>You have to ask them what their end game is and provide relevant factual information as appropriate. Make them really examine why they want lockdowns, masks, social distancing, etc. Ask them if they think these are good for society in the long run. Ask them how long they want it to go on. But more importantly ask them what their goal is. Originally it was to flatten the curve to not overwhelm the hospital system. Mission accomplished (for the most part-New York for example may have had more problems on this front). Now what do we do? Wait for a vaccine? No cases? Ask them if they think these goals are realistic. We need to make this a strategy. It is important that we are mot confrontational and to the best of our abilities leave politics out of it. ESPECIALLY anything regarding Trump. At least 70% of the COVID hysteria in California is driven by spite for Trump at this point. How do we get this going nationwide (worldwide?) in order to force lockdown proponents to examine their beliefs.</p></p>

        <p>BUT IF WE LOCKED DOWN CORRECTLY AND EVEN HARDER THE VIRUS WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED IN MINUTES</p>
<p>there’s no changing the mind of someone glued to their ideology, which is what this became. Ask for evidence; and you’re a “Karen.”</p>

        <p>The Matrix is a system Neo. That system is our enemy.  But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters; the very minds of the people we are trying to save.  But until we do these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy.  You have to understand most of these people are not ready to be unpluged.  And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.</p>

        <p>Ask them if they're certain that their mask is capturing every single viral particle spewed from their moths or if it's just collecting the viral particles as they breathe and then allowing the accumulated virus to be ejected through the fabric onto whoever is unfortunate enough to speak to them. If there's a chance that their mask is only partially effective or even makes things worse and they believe that no one should willingly contribute to viral spread, then like you said, are they willing to never have a nonessential outing or social interaction until the virus is eliminated completely? Or are they willing to admit that some risk is acceptable? Why was this same risk acceptable last year, but not now? Are they willing to admit that they they can't see viruses or how they spread and a fabric mask is a security blanket meant to assuage their fears so that the economy didn't collapse and theoretically can't prevent viral transmission? Ask them if they've left the house for a nonessential reason and how they know they weren't responsible for killing someone, or is it impossible to know because viruses are invisible to the naked eye and the best actions we can take to prevent them is to not lick our hands or raw dog strangers. Sure, maybe concerts and sports events seem like a good way to spread a respiratory virus, but do they want to be the person who prevents thousands of people from doing what makes their life worth living because they may later choose walk past one of the attendees in a grocery store? Can they not get groceries delivered and never leave their house again if they're really that worried, or do they really believe that if 50% of people do that while all the nonessential workers continue on, that the virus will be eliminated? Just tell them to get an antibody test, they probably already had it and didn't even notice.</p>
