    <strong>Do you have the typical abused friend that doesn't realize she is being abused?</strong>
    <p><p>- Hey, I think your partner's intentions for you are shady...</p>
<p>+ How dare you speak like that about him/her?</p>
<p>- Well, I saw him yesterday kissing another girl/boy. Besides, he has a reputation of a cheater...</p>
<p>+ What? You don't know him/her like I do. And you don't have proof! You just don't want to see me happy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I think it is fair to say that majority of people with minimal social life have been on both sides of the story. Don't get me wrong, it is normal. For we learn from our mistakes sooner or later and helps us to become smarter and more alert.</p>
<p>3 months after, obviously reality hits hard and your friend has bigger horns than the empire state and tells you (in tears) why wasn't his/her 8 years friend trusted instead of that person he/she dated since 3 months ago.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now that context is set. I can't help but think of the current events as an abusive relationship, except it is between the very ethically questionable people high up in the economic ladder and people all the way down. Also with the exception that some of us see through this and we will all pay for those who refuse to bring their perfect lover (rich people, which include media and government) down of the pedestal. For wether we like it or not we are in this together.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, there are rich people that are ethical, but usually those people live peaceful simple lives out of sight of Mainstream Media.</p>
<p>Just like in that type of relationship, humanity as a collective needs a humbling and hard reminder not to be weak passive zombies or the consecuences may be catastrophic. And once the lie is uncovered, fantasy land will fall down real quick. I get it, it is not fair for us that have been calling out this BS since it started. But if people don't revolt now it will inevitably happen, or rather it needs to happen for people to revolt.</p>
<p>Coronashit is just another step in the attempt to make us more dependent on them. Weaker, more passive, more docile. Then when shit gets real bad and people start pointing blaming fingers then everyone will say they didn't support this, or that they didn't notice. And you know what? no hatred from me, at least. Because I expect nothing from anyone supporting this bullshit. They don't (Majority) even support this BS, they just want to gain score in the eyes of their perfect lover.</p>

<p>Thanks for coming to my ted talk folks.</p></p>

        <p>Oh, do I have experience when it comes to this. My parents were pretty authoritarian and they wanted to make me a mini-me of them and think like them and be like them and they basically wanted me to live my life how they wanted and they thought they owned me. But even as a little girl, I never let them. I was always my own person despite anything they said or did to me. But lots of people aren't that headstrong. I had quite a few friends in middle and high school who were literally brainwashed by their parents, and their parents did the exact same things mine tried and failed to do to me, only they couldn't see it and thought their parents were being so harsh and cruel to them because they "loved them" and were "trying to protect them." They would get critical of me if I pointed this out because of the Stockholm syndrome they had for their parents. Scary stuff and that is what leads to tyrannies like this.</p>

        <p>You are so right. People have this vague notion of what an abuser is. Therefore it is very hard for then to get out and they bash anyone who goes against the river flow.</p>
<p>Also, I want to commend and congratulate you for being that headstrong, it is not an easy task. 
Thank you for sharing your story.</p>

        <p>Thanks. I really wish people would learn to stand up for themselves before it's too late. Lots of people don't even realize when it's happening. That's what so scary. Some of those friends I mentioned, were like that when I met them. But even worse is watching a friend who used to stand up for themselves slowly succumb to it. And it's not just a one way street. It's not all the person's fault, because even if you're super headstrong, it can happen to you if you let your guard down (although headstrength helps a lot). But even though the abuser is a horrible person, and they need to take a great deal of the blame, you need to be able to realize the signs to prevent it from happening. </p>
<p>One of my friends, always super individualistic, never let her authoritative parents throw her around, always stood up for herself, I remember telling her once how I see how her parents are tightening it on her, trying even harder to brainwash her. She told me not to worry, she would never let them gaslight her. And I believed her. This girl was about as strong-willed as I am. She didn't give up easily, she knew the signs, and knew how it happens, by making you think the people trying to save you from them are the bad guys. She told me that in the case it happens, she would want me to do everything I can to reach her. But it still happened. And I tried as hard as I could, desperate to help her. But I couldn't. That's how powerful brainwashing can be.</p>

        <p>Yeah, gaslighting is a powerful tool. But once you know the tactics, it is easier to identify them. I will send you something interesting to read by message.</p>
<p>Anyhow, you don't have to look further than the comments on this thread to see examples of the things you mentioned.</p>
