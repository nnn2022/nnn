    <strong>Covid panic is a psyop rooted in triggering borderline ans narcissistic personality disorders.</strong>
    <p><p>Most pro mask people were suffering borderline disorders before "covid".  The mandates just intensify these disorders.  Most pro mask, pro lockdown people are typically useless basement dwellers, those who never missed a check during this whole thing or think Biden will bail them out. No one in the real world, working out there in hospitals,  news channels, grocery stores etc. reflect the sheepish attitudes on reddit. No one outside of the internet believes in the scamdemic.  If you were wondering, I live in NYC, so yeah, the hospitals were never overwhelmed, people aren't dropping dead of covid, death numbers are fudged and we are the most mask compliant in the nation yet, the cases are allegedly still "rising". Still people living in podunk arkansas claim that 1 out of 500 people in Manhattan not wearing a mask while jogging alone is the cause for extended lockdowns. Its complete bunk and anyone supporting mask and lockdowns have blood on their hands. 
 It's a scam people wake up. </p>
<p>The "conspiracy nut job" is simply a meme to discredit anyone challenging the narrative,  despite what many believe,  is not based on any science</p></p>
