    <strong>BEWARE : fake version of Klaus Schwab's "The Great Reset" available on Amazon</strong>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/great_reset/comments/k1nyl1/dr_sucharit_bhakdis_excellent_corona_false_alarm/">In another topic</a>, I pointed out that Dr Sucharit Bhakdi's 160 page book "Corona, False Alarm?" has been purged from Amazon and replaced <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corona-False-Alarm-Facts-Figures/dp/9492916045/">by a fake 40 version</a>.</p>
<p>Now I noticed that there's also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NYR8HV9/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_nl_NL=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=covid-19&amp;qid=1606435247&amp;rnid=16579970031&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2">a fake version of Schwab's "The Great Reset"</a> on Amazon.</p>
<p>How do I know it's fake? Well, first of all, the author of the real book are Thierry Malleret &amp; Klaus <strong>Schwab</strong>. The fake "new release" has but a sole author named Klaus <strong>Swab.</strong></p>
<p>Also, the real version of this book is 282 pages. The fake version has only 82 pages.</p>
<p>Then there's the "new release" slapped on the cover, which was done in a very sloppy manner. And if you look at the actual content, it looks just as sloppy. If you skim through the content, you'll find a section title that says "How covid influence the world economy", which should cause any grammar nazi to shudder in terror. And the summary... well... This doesn't exactly sound like anytning Schwab would write, now, does it?!</p>
<p>&rt;This book's concepts give users a good understanding and an excellent explanation of the virus. You will begin with a general introduction, description of the disease, and information about the economic crisis after the pandemic. The social reset and how covid 19 influence people across the world, geopolitical resets, and the pandemic's influence on the world.</p>
<p>Finally, note that the real version is published by a Swiss publisher named "ISBN Agentur Schweiz". The fake version is "Independently published", which usually means that it's printed on demand by Amazon's own publishing service.</p>
<p>So, just today I've found TWO FAKE BOOKS on Amazon dealing with respectively the "Great Reset" and Covid-19 hysteria. Having collected books for nearly 2 decades, I've never seen anything like this on Amazon before. So twice on one day is just... surreal. But it's 2020, so I guess everything has to be surreal now. That's the new normal after all...</p>
<p>Maybe these are just attempts to grab a quick buck from book titles that are going viral. Maybe it's something much more malignant at work here. I honestly can't tell... but it's definitely something to watch out for in the future, as we're probably going to see more of these.</p>
<p>Either way, buyers beware. Make sure you by <a href="https://www.amazon.nl/Covid-19-Great-Reset-Thierry-Malleret/dp/2940631123/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_nl_NL=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=covid-19&amp;qid=1606435247&amp;rnid=16579970031&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">the REAL version of Schwab's book</a> if you want to know what he wrote about "The Great Reset", and not the pretty obvious fake one.</p></p>

<p>Like OP says, notice the difference between the authors names and the number of pages.</p>

        <p>Would reporting that fake book do anything? I cannot believe that Amazon would be happy, even if they disagree with Mr. Schwab, of having fake books purporting to be from him on their platform.</p>

        <p>&rt;The royal family were incredibly close with Jimmy Savile, and protected him, just like they did Prince Andrew.</p>
<p>Andrew also was pretty close to Epstein.</p>
<p>And in Belgium, there's been rumours about royals organizing hunting parties on naked children, back when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux">Dutroux affair</a> was still the rage.</p>
<p>I don't think any sane person really wants to know about how depraved people can get when they have so much wealth and power that they can buy pretty much any vice, no matter how disturbing or illegal, and totally get away with it...</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;Why on earth would anyone think these people have our best interests at heart?</p>
<p>It seems that many people genuinely believe that it's perfectly normal for journalists and activists to get "suicided" by Russian oligarchs or Chinese aparatchiks if they try to expose their corruption, but somehow the oligarchs in the West really care about their peasants and only want what's best for us. Our leaders = benevolent do-gooders, their leaders = evil monsters.</p>
<p>Indoctrination &amp; socialization does very strange with the human mind. It can create all kinds of combinations of utterly nonsensical and often incompatible beliefs...</p>

        <p>The Dutroux scandal was a major scandal in Belgium that led to mass protects in the country back in the 1990s. There was clear evidence that Dutroux (like Epstein) was someone who provided underage sex slaves for some very powerful people, but this got totally covered up and most people seem to have forgotten about it in the decades that followed...</p>
<p>From Wikipedia :</p>
<p>&rt;Documents were released by WikiLeaks that show that large sums of money in different currencies arrived in Michelle Martin's bank account timely linked to the disappearances of the abducted girls. The money was also transferred in foreign currencies from Morocco and Saudi Arabia. Both the transfers and the value of the six properties that Dutroux owned suggested to investigators that he was financed by a larger pedophile and prostitution ring. The Flemish newspaper <em>Nieuwsblad</em> reported that he had committed health-insurance fund fraud, theft, insurance fraud and investments on the stock market and that that had contributed to his wealth.</p>
<p>Also :</p>
<p>&rt;The officer leading the investigation, De Baets, said that they followed up on all testimonies the X witnesses had given, in order to determine whether what they said was possible or not and that they came to the conclusion that it was possible that the things had occurred as the witnesses described them. As this took up a lot of resources and time of the police force an inquiry was initiated into the handling of the case, which then again took up as much resources as the investigation of De Baets itself. It was said that: "<em>The suspicion grew that De Baets and others formed part of a sect bent on destabilising the kingdom.</em>" So De Baets and large parts of his team were removed from the investigation and sent home on indefinite leave.</p>
<p>And :</p>
<p>&rt;[Judge Jean-Marc] Connerotte testified in the Dutroux case on 4 March 2004. He broke down in the witness box stating that there had been high-level murder plots to stop his investigation into the child-sex mafia. He stated that he had to drive in bullet-proof cars and had armed guards around him at all times because shadowy figures from the crime world were threatening him. The police had informed him that murder contracts had been taken out against the prosecutors in the case. He alleged that organised crime methods were used to discredit his work and make sure that the investigation would end in a judicial failure.</p>
<p>I rest my case...</p>

        <p>I saw you post it in another thread. Also, i literally never said you did like to force people to do anything. I said that it is absolutely fine that you are pro mask and wear a mask. I think i can speak for most of us in saying that what we are adamantly against is being forced to wear them if we don't want to. Therefore, you can be as pro mask as you want and wear one yourself and it won't bother us. I never said you thought we should be forced to.</p>

        <p>Sorry about accusing you of accusing me of forcing people to do things. Got a little confused there, haha. Ive been trying to strike up conversation on this sub cause I’m interested and I feel like it’s relevant to mention I’m pro mask, because that’s the minority here</p>

        <p>Ok, so why do you not listen to what the doctors say? I can get that goverment people can easily be corrupt, and that media can blow things out of proportions, but legit doctors (like my own) advocate for lockdown and masks, and though I can’t speak for you, I’m sure they know better then I and are more educated. What’s your thoughts on that? It the biggest point that I don’t really get about people who are against masks.</p>

        <p>Okay i have three major points. I'm not necessarily refuting things i think YOU said, rather refuting things I've heard floating around. 1. Doctors largely follow the herd, if one doctor gets media attention most other doctors will fall in line on that subject. 2. This disease is simply not as deadly as it is made out to be as evidenced by the CDC changing guidelines to make covid deaths an assumption with no testing necessary. 3.  All the "science" that doesn't fit the narrative is just not shown by media. Why would media want people to be calm when panic makes their ratings so high? Plenty of doctors disagree with the handling of this illness. Now i have some unrelated points i want to add on. I can link URLS after i get home. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cloth masks have been shown to be completely useless if not more dangerous than no mask. Surgical masks are useless after a short amount of time or very minor environmental changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young people aren't dying from this. If you are also male, you and i are in an age and sex bracket that makes up .002% of all deaths in America. That is one out of 50,000 if my math is accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blanket lockdowns do more harm than good. Protection of the actually vulnerable populations would be somewhat less draconian because it would at least be realistic. Blanket locking down every person in an area that doesn't fit the seemingly random "essential" criteria is nonsensical and shows it isn't about health, but control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lies. The lies and pure propaganda being pushed make most semi-skeptical people have an adverse reaction. When a disease is supposedly insanely deadly and we need the news to even know it exists, something doesn't connect. Also, Fauci has lied and admitted to it multiple times. These doctors don't say things because they actually know. They say them to fit in and not be excluded.</p>

        <p>First of all, I’m not trying to disagree, but just to at least respond to most of your points. <br>
I totally get that the media likes making things bigger then it is, and I don’t really trust them. I don’t think we (anyone) know much for sure about the virus and so I am not 100% sure always on what to do, but I tend to stay on the safe side. Tbh I’m pretty surprised about the cloth mask stuff, though it makes a bit of sense. If I’m regularly adjusting something on my face, then that might be a bit of a problem. I’d think that it would help in some ways though, like if someone with the virus coughs or sneezes then I’d think any mask would do at least a bit to help.</p>
<p>I really don’t think I have to worry about the virus (though you never know) cause I’m young and male, but I do worry about bringing the virus to my older family.</p>
<p>I don’t understand your problems with essential workers, they seem pretty self explanatory to me. The people who everyone needs to survive, like the people who heal and those who provide food, need to keep working. They are essential, so we can’t really afford to put them in lockdown. <br>
I do think a lockdown of just the vulnerable would be smart, as the economy and mental health of the country are really suffering, but that would be kinda difficult for anyone who works or lives with vulnerable people, who might be able to bring the virus in.</p>
<p>i have a few things I’m wondering. do you think someone is trying to make this more difficult then it has to be, or is it just a combination of media who desperately want clicks and views and disagreeing scientists?</p>
<p>Also, do you think it’s worth just wearing a mask to be polite even if you doubt their helpfulness? I am just wondering your opinion.</p>

        <p>My point about essential workers is that the choosing of who was or wasn't essential was arbitrary. I think people are definitely making this more difficult than it needs to be.  Those people are the media as well as scientists who feel important. Notice that the scientists that are helping create all these restrictions are employees of the government. What does government do? Try to retain as much power as possible. Keeping the hysteria going is good for them. If all the contrary evidence to this disease wasn't being censored, i would be less extreme.  But the censorship shows me that these people have something to hide. Oh yeah, and who does the censoring? Big tech companies that have profited ENORMOUSLY during this pandemic. Finally, yes, i wear a mask over my mouth only when i am given no other choice. I don't wear it when i don't "have to". I know many on this forum will call me a pussy but i can't afford to be kicked out of college for not wearing one.</p>
<p>One more thing. The censorship is real. Johns Hopkins just took down their own article because it went against the mainstream narrative. Here is a link: https://web.archive.org/web/20201126043553/https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2020/11/a-closer-look-at-u-s-deaths-due-to-covid-19</p>

        <p>The censorship is pretty messed up, i don’t really understand why anybody’d do that. Do you think the big tech would? I mean, this is certainly good for their businesses, but I’m not sure that they’d have the guts to do this, at least not on a big scale. I suspect the have the recourses to do so, but I‘d think they’d be worried about being caught trying to suppress stuff like this.</p>
<p>Government kinda sucks, it always gonna do what it can to get more power and keep the same people in power. Again, I’m not sure they would want to do anything to terrible, at least our of fear of being judged or caught.</p>
<p>Do you think there’s gonna be a big change in public opinion about this whole thing? I suspect it‘ll just pass, a vaccine will get made, and we’ll just remember it as the apocalypse year.</p>

        <p>I don't just think big tech would censor, i know they do. Here is how the strategy goes. A position is taken by the media (regardless of what the decision is or why it was chosen). Then, when any contrary evidence comes along, they get "fact" checked. The fact checkers use the initial decision as their evidence. Then, that is used to discredit any further contrary evidence and those who dissent are labeled conspiracy nuts. </p>
<p>The big tech companies don't need the guts to keep this going because they are fully backed by the media who puts information out to the masses.  So if they ever get caught (which they do every day by average people) it will not get reported on. Imo one of your biggest misconceptions is that big tech, media, and government actually fear the people and that the people are actually in control. We have no recourse against these organizations that will ever be taken seriously.</p>
<p>I think public opinion will slowly keep sliding in favor of freedoms and ending this fiasco. I think many of these restrictions will be used again and again now that they know a decent amount of people will just listen. </p>
<p>The vaccine is going to be another fiasco.
Firstly, these companies are absolutely rushing these vaccines in order to be the first one done so that governments will sign contracts with them first so they get the money. The fastest vaccine ever produced was made in 4 years. These ones were made in less than 9 months. How can they possibly know any long term effects? Second, there are already some technical issues with these vaccines. For example, astrozeneca stated they had something like a 90% success rate. They recently put out that they accidentally gave many patients a half dose, completely changing efficacy rates. Third, this vaccine uses a totally new method of effecting the immune system using mRNA. This has never been as far as i know. </p>
<p>I really hope you're right and we look back on this year as a one-off. However, i highly doubt it, as it has already been proven that this was the most successful way in all of history to give money to the mega-rich with very little public disapproval. Also, the government has showed the mega rich that they have no issue going to these measures over anything that people find slightly scary. So i have genuine fears that this will either continue at full-force or in some aspects indefinitely OR that it will go back to normal and then revert as soon as some other illness comes around. </p>
<p>I am extremely tired so i hope this makes sense</p>

        <p>We listen to the epidemiologists and doctors who have signed the Great Barrington Declaration. They say wearing masks outdoors is of little to zero benefit and that lockdowns do not work, are not working and harm far more people than they ‘helps.’ Lockdowns just outsource the risk of getting sick to those poor and desperate enough to have no other options but to ‘serve’ the wfh pro-lockdown folks.</p>
