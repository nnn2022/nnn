        <p>It's nuts too because I remember a time last year when Hydroxychloroquine was brushed off as being promoted by "quack" doctors... Brushed off is kind of an understatement too, it seemed like such a deliberate suppression of information now that I look back on it. These people aggressively try to squash any ideas or people that step out of line because it might jeopardize the narrative.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately this is not new... all the big tech overlords have been assaulting free speech and the exchange of science for at least a year now... try talking about ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, try raising questions about efficacy or adverse events and reactions and you'll get silenced.

<p>Ivermectin, hydroxycloroquine, vitamin D, and the other treatments listed by the website linked by u/Arya_Dharma are <em>not</em> standard acceptable treatments, for there is currently no conclusive evidence for their benefit.</p>

        <p>Totally. Not debating the efficacy of these drugs (especially vitamin d which I've read multiple impressive papers on) - just felt the title was misleading - even further - that phrase "no standard acceptable treatment" comes from US <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=56.102">Code Title 21, Section 56.102 part (d)</a> and unfortunately that is a definition not a regulation. According to the fda regulations I've read an EUA only has a few requirements up to the interpretation of the relevant bodies (don't really feel the need to look it up at the moment, but happy to and would stand corrected if challenged)</p>

        <p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2855046/ - an interesting look at vitamin d and the immune system in general</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32967126/ - another very interesting one - abstract isn't super interesting but the full text is, if you need access to the full text I can dm you
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8061565/ 
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7398646/ </p>
<p>Overall, basically the synopsis of all the studies (without any counter-conclusions I could find) is that ensuring you have good levels of vitamin d in your systems prior to exposure is critical (but also what makes it hard to test) furthermore, the main position of these studies is that vitamin d reinforces the latent (non-targeted) immune system, and helps bolster a quicker and faster targeted response.</p>
<p>There is evidence to suggest vitamin d helps to prevent the covid-19 infection... (some of the above cite studies)</p>
<p>There is no evidence to suggest a severe covid patient is treatable with vitamin d however... so basically my understanding has become: ensure you get enough direct sunlight on your skin (everyone has different needs based on age, race, sex, etc), or make sure that you take enough for your body to keep a healthy immune system. In the case that you start to feel sick you should take an elevated amount to assist your immune response. Digging into the literature, there was worry for a while about overdoing vitamin d, but these are all from chronic usage, short term over saturation of vitamin d should not harm anyone.</p>

        <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>From your sources, it seems that Vitamin D is not a sufficient treatment either.</p>
<p>Seeing that the other treatments listed by u/Arya-Dharma's website also have inconclusive benefits in treatment, I hope u/Arya-Dharma is reassured that Emergency Use Authorization of the vaccines is justified. I am finding the label "Corruption" to be quite far-fetched...</p>

        <p>No its not a treatment to cure severe covid, but there is tons of evidence that it can lessen, prevent and reduce the symptoms, and is one of the few correlations between all groups both reslient and vulnerable that provide a strong predictor of the outcome. I'm currently looking for the paper that does this cross demographic analysis showing on the order of 97% reduction of severe covid outcomes (hospitalization) its super fascinating.</p>

<p>There are various studies that show that Vitamin D deficiency can increase SARS-CoV-2 symptoms.</p>
<p>However most people are <em>not</em> Vitamin D deficient. I am questioning the effectiveness of supplementation for those who already have sufficient Vitamin D.</p>
<p>Studies on supplementation of Vitamin D have shown evidence both for strong effects and no/weak effect, and therefore the evidence is inconclusive. I believe "looking for the paper..." is "cherry picking" data. Of course, you may find some studies showing high effectiveness of Vitamin D supplements, but you may also find some studies showing low effectiveness. Please try to include both whenever you come across studies \^_\^</p>

        <p>of course and certainly - "looking for" was more around finding the one that I was thinking of that I found super compelling, but it does look like you are already aware of the research - One of the papers I provided mentions what you are also mentioning very specifically - it also goes on to say that setting up a proper experiment to derive conclusive results has demonstrated itself to be a bit elusive based on the timing of when vitamin d levels would need to be measured (prior to and during initial stages of infection) - either way I would agree with you that conclusive studies have not been performed, but I would say that I come to the conclusion based on the reading I've done that there is something there worthy of continued research -- and I think that's my major intent here - not to "throw the baby out with the bathwater" so to say - and as I am always eager to read more on the topic - please do send any supporting or contra-supporting papers my way :)</p>

        <p>I definitely agree though that it would not be considered a standard of treatment --- in case that was not clear, I think we are in agreement, I just wanted to separate in particular that there is really really interesting aspects in prevention and modulation of the illness</p>

        <p>anecdotally by the way, it was my personal doctor that turned me onto reading research in vitamin d (as well as vitamin A and vitamin k2) - he apparently did research work on it I learned when I asked him a couple of years ago after I overheard him raving about it to an elderly patient as he walked him out of the office - he was super excited to share with me and even gave me a ref to his paper (that i have been trying to find recently - may go back and ask him for the ref (doi) again) -- I did some reading and since then have been taking supplements to bolster my immune system when I've spent too much time inside, or have a hard time getting A or k2 from food, or just generally in the winter... as well as when i start to feel run down I take a bit more. I have gotten sick, but never more than 2 days max, and always much milder than my coworkers or friends.... this is of course is anecdotal but it was enough for me to be sold on it --- especially after a really nasty bug going around my office and could feel something really bad coming on --- took vitamin A, k2, and 6000 IUs of vitamin d3 daily (plus sun if i could) and felt 100% after only a day or so.</p>

        <p>Thank you for sharing \^_\^</p>
<p>But you must understand that I try to avoid using anecdotal evidence to form my worldview. Often, anecdotes have at least a several biases involved, and are amplified by constant sharing on social media.</p>
<p>For example, you would understand that one who reads your anecdote may be suspicious of confirmation bias and the placebo effect.</p>

        <p>Oh certainly and same here. Anecdotal evidence equates to an opinion, and not necessarily an educated one (i.e. its worth basically nothing in validation) - we are on the same page. I've just been super interested into the research on those vitamins for quite some time, even prior to covid, and have read some really interesting papers (after falling down multiple citation rabbit holes) which honestly makes it hard to recall them a bit later... frustratingly so... unfortunately you make a great point about amplification on social media, I guess I just really would encourage you to read further than the linked studies - if anything would recommed falling down the citation rabbit hole if you think it might be worth your time - I actually tried to find some counter papers of course as it is only fair nowadays to do so as well. </p>
<p>anyways, take care, and if you do find any interesting papers, do feel free to send me some anytime. I love reading research</p>
