    <strong>Want to know how to troll wokes?</strong>
    <p><p>Attack their virtue. There’s nothing a woke person cares about more than being seen as virtuous; so if you want to shut them down, all you need to do is highlight the fact that they’re in fact, unrighteous.</p>
<p>If a woke is complaining about “cisgendered straight males”, make them out to be the resentful hater that they are; ie. “why do you hate people for how they were born?”. If they are calling you a racist, just blatantly say that “attacking my character doesn’t make you seem virtuous”. Of course, this style of trolling also works for nosy mask zealots too by asking them something like “what sin are you trying to atone for by telling me to wear a mask?”.</p>
<p>Don’t debate shit with wokes or call them names that makes you seem like you’re on the bad side. You can’t neutralize their beliefs without neutralizing the quasi-religious philosophy behind their beliefs, which ultimately is one that promises salvation given virtuous atonement for the original sin of being born in a position of privilege. If you demonstrate that they are not in fact virtuous in the eyes of the public, or at least not as virtuous as you, you win the argument.</p></p>

        <p>"How many of your neighbors and friends and family did you label "Non-Essential" and throw into poverty last year?"</p>
<p>I find this one works well. Of course the answer is predictable.</p>
<p>"I didn't! or some form thereof.</p>
<p>"How many of your neighbors and friends and family do you plan on labeling "Non-Essential" and throwing into poverty this year?" is usually a good follow up.</p>
<p>All they will want to do is talk about masks - don't fall for that trap. It's a pointless argument. When you talk about the effects of the shutdown on human beings - that's where you are really hitting the virtue button.</p>
