    <strong>Dealing with all of this as a Christian?</strong>
    <p><p>I know not everybody believes in Jesus or God for that matter, but I want to address and ask how other Chriatians are handling all of this. </p>
<p>The bible tells us to honor all rulers and pay them respect, because all powers are appointed by God good or bad. We are not to speak evil of dignitaries, and are to follow the ordinances of those who are appointed to rule over us. For all power is appointed by God and nothing that happens can happen outside of Him allowing it. Of course we are also taught to rebel when these decrees go against the teaching of God. </p>
<p>Sure i hate the masks, I hate the social distancing and the lockdowns and everything about it all, but I do not go around town trying to rebel or flex my rights as an American, neither do I take to social media to spew my conspiracies no matter how much I believe them to be true. I don't openly advocate for rebellion against the stomping of our constitutional rights as Americans.  As much as it all saddens me, i know I am to still attribute honor to our appointed rulers, as evil as I might perceive them to be. </p>
<p>As much as I know Jesus has the power to lift us up and to bring us all through this and work it out for the good for those who believe, I still am struggling. Spiritually and mentally I struggle. I cannot find work, the job market is bleak and there is loads and loads of competition. I am lucky to even get a call back from perspective employers. And it gets to me. </p>
<p>Paul teaches us that he who will not work should neither eat. Some days I feel useless, just absolutely pathetic. I go on walks to attempt to stay active, but my body is becoming soft. I am fatigued. My mind is going soft, i often struggle to focus and find motivation. I feel tired all the time. I go through a routine every day of reading and checking social media, but its becoming wearisome. So monotonous and bland. I haven't seen a strangers face in idk how long, that just doesn't feel right to me.</p>
<p>I know Jesus teaches us to not be apart of the world, and to hate our lives on earth and not love the things of the world. But wow am I really disliking this life here on earth lately. Its almost unbelievable how far gone I feel concerning the cares of this world. We had dreams, my wife and I, plans to seek a simple life on our property. But all of our dreams and aspirations have all but vanished into thin air. We have no means to finance it now, and are seemingly stuck in the state we are in now. I know mans plans are nothing in the face of God's plans, and we have done pretty well of accepting that. It is just hard to see the light in the future this world is about to face. </p>
<p>This whole "pandemic" isnt causing me to lose my faith, in fact is has strengthened it. I lean on God now more than I ever have in life. I wouldn't be able to make it if it weren't for the mercy and graciousness of God's gifts to sustain my family and I. I have also been able to read the bible like I never have had a chance before. I've finally finished it cover to cover and have had time to study the parts that are somewhat harder to understand. The only comfort I find is when I am in Gods word. So I am thankful for that. </p>
<p>I truly believe this is the end, that we are in the final stretch that will lead to the last days. I dont see this world going another 10 or 15 years at this pace. Human nature simply wont be able to handle it. Technology is great and neat, but wow I think weve taken it too far. The simple speed in which society moves is becoming too much to bare. We have exponentially exploded into darkness, a world I never dreamed of witnessing. The way people act, and treat themselves and one another simply cannot continue. All I want is to plow a feild, raise a heard of livestock, and wait for the crops to come in. I want no part of this hustle and bustle. I dont care about the latest cars or new fancy gadgets and phones. I want a team of horses and ratty shack that I can call mine. I dont want much from this world and even that is becoming hard enough to find. </p>
<p>I cannot wait until the day Jesus returns, to gather up his children and to cleanse the world with fire. To take us to a new world where there are no sorrows or tears. I pray so much for His expedient return. </p>
<p>I'm not sure where I intended this post to go, so forgive my ramblings. I enjoy hearing others accounts of life in the new normal, as depressing as it can be to read. But Id like to hear the views and experiences of my fellow Christian brothers and sisters.</p></p>

        <p>I always got a bad vibe from the stuff in the Bible about submitting to the government. If we're following Christ, it's pretty clear that He was a rebel, unafraid to correct the authorities when they were wrong. Like John Knox said, "Defiance of tyranny is obedience to God".</p>
<p>Jesus didn't fear death, and death had no dominion over Him. They tortured Him to death, and still He rose again.</p>
<p><em>Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</em></p>

        <p>That yoke of bondage is bondage to sin. </p>
<p>Peter also wrote of obeying the government. I believe Paul was speaking with the Holy Spirit. If you dont trust Paul than you dont trust 2/3 of the entire New Testament. I believe in the entirety of scripture. </p>
<p>Jesus followed the law, he was the only innocent one. The law of the time was Jewish law, and truth is the Jews did not follow the law. Jesus was not a rebel, he was the only one who followed the law. He called out sin and hypocrisy. </p>
<p>The stuff we are dealing with aren't sin issues, nor are they transgressions of Gods law. I dont feel the need to speak out enthusiastically against what city counsels are doing to America. I think it's wrong, but I am not going to become a transgressive of the laws of the land even though they are anti constitutional. My home is in Heaven, not America. Once the laws start to go against Gods ordinances, then yes, I will rebel.</p>

        <p>I think as Christians we should definitely speak out against whats wrong, but not in a hateful and ignorant way (like reposting ignorant memes). I hate the masks, but I didn't mind at all if a small business or people asked us to wear them. I just don't want the government mandating it. My main focus right now is getting my kids through this with this not affecting them anymore than it has to, and not having it be a horrible year for them. I want them to remember it in a different way than I will. I've got them involved in everything I can,  take them everywhere fun that I can, and since they are under the age requirement , I have masks for them but I don't make them wear them unless requires it for all ages (for instance our public library mandates it for all ages ) but our church doesn't enforce it. 
I think Christians should speak out and be an example for others.  I like Sean Fuecht on YouTube. He's an example of making a difference by helping others during this hard time.</p>

        <p>Thank you. It is hard. Because I get scared and depressed but I can't let them see it. My husband is the better parent. He isn't affected by this at all. He isn't even remotely worried, he thinks its all going to be fine. He's been taking my kids hiking and fishing and camping and just spending time with him.  He never had that much time off work before. He loved it. He wanted to lockdown longer so he could be home more. He thinks lockdowns are dumb, but he did enjoy being home so much.</p>

        <p>Yeah, as a Christian, I don't agree with that method of thinking. My allegiance is not to any ruler. I have one ruler. Furthermore I don't think all leaders are appointed by God. I dont think Hitler was appointed by God so that Hitler could have the privilege of murdering millions of His chosen people. I think bad things happen and bad leaders exist, not because God made them that way, but because of free will. Human beings decide our choices in life and whether to be good or evil. I dont think its ever God's intention that we have an evil ruler. I do think God gives people the choice and inspiration to be better leaders or to overthrow bad ones. Disagree if you like, everyone's interpretation of scripture is different, but I don't think the Bible requires that I simp for my government and corporate overlords.</p>

        <p>The bible says very plainly, and very often, that God appoints all rulers. I believe the scriptures, and its well within your rights to disagree with them. But scripture is my last authority, so it is the position I take.</p>

        <p>As stated in my original post, there are many instances in which we are not to obey Government. When laws go against Gods word we are to obey God first. Of course I would not have turned in Jews. </p>
<p>The midwives hid Moses and other children when the King sent out a decree that all newborn Hebrew children should be killed, and God looked kindly upon the midwives. Because they feared God and obeyed him first.</p>

        <p>You can laugh, thats fine. But i can assure you neither I nor God takes pleasure in the destruction of the wicked. God desires that all would come to repentance and be saved, and so do I. </p>
<p>In fact its incredibly sad that anyone will go to Hell, especially since they dont have to go there.</p>

        <p>Think about this-  Do you recall the so called 'Accidental' release of the Microsoft ad (released on Good Friday 2020) with Spirit Cooking Satanist Marina Abramovic promoting their Virtual Reality Goggles?  It received heavy dislikes and they suddenly pulled the ad.  This was NO ACCIDENT--- it is part of their agenda to destroy Christianity- The Great Reset, Agenda 21.  They have written this entire takeover performance to follow the Bible scriptures and Prophecies of Revelations.  On purpose.  Every Christian in the world is seeing the signs and believe we are in Revelations, as intended.  They are being DUPED by a huge and wicked, long planned Agenda.  Christians are going to be the hardest group to get to comply with taking the chip and vaccine-  they will be extremely broken and bewildered, making it easier to manipulate them when they realize they have been played.   This is 100% EVIL and I hope God decides it's time to out script them.  TRUST NO ONE you see on your screens-- it's all an orchestrated performance, long in the making.  Sorry to say, but including Trump.  They needed an actor like him to create the extreme polarization to pit the country against each other to such violent levels-- Good VS. Evil, Clean VS.. Dirty, Misogynistic VS. Pro Feminist, Racists VS. Oppressed,  the list goes on.  The country will be absolutely broken when they discover that Trump is one of the New World Order elites pulling off this coupe.  I know I was broken when I figured this out.  We can't stop this takeover.  It's peasants VS. the elites.  We have no one in the fight for us.</p>

        <p>Thats an interesting take, ive never heard it put like that before. Dont get me wrong, I agree Trump is controlled opposition. Ive never trusted him from the get go, as much as I wanted to. </p>
<p>Maybe youre right, but I wouldnt be surprised if its knowing the revelations that causes the world powers to act this way, litterally bring about the end. Like a self fullfilling prophecy. The way they cast lots for Jesus' coat as to fullfill prophecy. God works in mysterious ways. </p>
<p>We cant know the truth, so thats why I try not to air out my theories as if i know them to be true. I can go all day with what I think is going on, and youve already said a lot of it.</p>

        <p>I will keep it at the forefront of my mind. It is an interesting thought. Just curious though, in your opinion how can faking Revelations series of events help to control Christians?</p>

        <p>I'm in a similar situation. I'm a chilled out Christian so I'm not an expert on the Bible but I believe you are allowed to feel angry, upset etc. Don't feel guilty about it . God felt wrath many times (old testament style.) It is all part of the human experience.</p>
<p>This situation is difficult for everyone, regardless of faith. I can only recommend good, honest prayer.</p>
<p>When I was feeling really down, I read 'Lamentations' - it is a depressing book of the Bible but it felt relevant...</p>
<p>I hope your prayers get answered soon and you find a solution.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the kind words. Lamentations is a good one. I especially like how Solomon has anything his heart could desire and yet still finds all the world to be vanity. Its a great truth, and reassurance to stay humble and try to be happy with what youve got. </p>

        <p>Your words are very relatable to me right now. At times, I simply do not have a clue what to do and I think the world is ending and all that. Other times, even on here, I see that spark in people that lets me know they haven't given up and I shouldn't either.</p>
<p>There's a lot of power in perspective and where we place our attention. For example, mainstream media does an excellent job at highlighting the negative and making it seem normal but it's such a farce. Like the riots, they make it look like an entire city is on fire when really it's a couple of blocks in the middle of a metropolis. Remember that evil entities can only take the power that you release to them. So I see the fear and negativity as tools of control. Even on a non-spiritual level, this holds true. </p>
<p>MSM also will make it seem like all the scientists and doctors agree with overwhelming consensus about covid, vaccines, masks, etc. which is again pretty far from the truth. The propaganda is at an all time high and it makes you wonder why? Is it because they've gained so much control? Or is it because they're so close to losing control they're getting desperate to deceive more people?</p>
<p>Maybe we are nearing ends times and they know their time is almost up? Maybe they want us to think that so we stand idle waiting for a Savior when Jesus really wanted us to save ourselves?</p>
<p>Some unanswerable questions, I'm sorry, but I hope they help you think through this. Things may not be as bad as they are made out to be. Humans are part of God's wonderful creation and they will try everything to get you to forget that, but they can never win until we all give up. </p>
<p>I will say, so many people out there do not want any part of this. Christians, athiests, liberals, conservatives, etc so many I've talked to on here and in real life are not buying this. The fight is far from over.</p>

        <p>Being anti lockdown/masks is out of the box thinking, you need to be able to think logically and rationally. </p>
<p>So why do you drop those qualities by being religious? You can think rationally about one thing by choose to believe in silliness in other areas?</p>

        <p>At the risk of turning this into a debate, ill just say that I am not religious. Believing in Jesus isn't exactly a religion, people turn it into a religion by adding their rituals and dogmatic practices and rules. </p>
<p>I don't need proof or evidence to know that Jesus is real, ive experienced first hand the miracles he can perform and has performed in my life. </p>
<p>The bible says God uses foolishness to confound the minds of the "wise". As in, people who think they are wise and knowledgeable will almost never come to the knowledge of God because they think too highly of themselves and are unable to humble themselves enough to let Jesus into their lives. </p>
<p>I went to Uni to study philosphy, I looked for truth everywhere my entire life. I studied logic and reasoning. I became a drug addicted nihilist, was care free, thought I knew it all. Its a miracle that only Jesus could have performed, when he pulled me out of the slime pit I had dug myself into. I surely am not a stranger to critical thinking, and I can assure the Bible is not silliness.</p>
