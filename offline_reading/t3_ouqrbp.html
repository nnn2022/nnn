        <p>I hope he actually has the power under state law to do this. As much as I hate to say it, I'm not 100% sure that he does.</p>
<p>He only got rid of municipality mask rules after there was a special session of the legislature that explicitly allowed him to do that. This kind of begs the question of why he even held that special session of the legislature, if he was really allowed to ban mask mandates in schools, and by extension presumably municipalities, all along.</p>
<p>The Georgia governor made a pretty big fool of himself when he said he was going to get rid of school mask mandates, only to discover a few hours later that he didn't have the authority to do that.</p>

        <p>If I was able I would totally move to Florida. Fortunately Arizona is one of the better states, especially compared to blue states.</p>

        <p>I just saw someone in another post state that Arizona is a "fascist wasteland" or something like that. It's so weird how inconsistent people in this sub are. I've seen people say my own state is mask-free, "nobody cares about masks", nobody is vaccinating, anti-vaxx, but I am seeing the exact opposite and worse.</p>

        <p>I don't know what he's talking about. I'm outside Phoenix, and sure there are sheep with masks, and Walmart just started forcing employees to wear masks again even if fully vaccinated, but compared to say California it's pretty good. So far businesses haven't started making customers wear masks again.</p>

        <p>What? First of all, there's no such thing as West Palm Beach schools- there's one school district per county in Florida. West Palm Beach is in Palm Beach County (where I live), so it's part of the Palm Beach County school district.</p>
<p>Second of all, I've never heard of a K-12 district mandating the vaccine, even for students over 12. Even the most liberal legal scholars say that mandating an EUA vaccine for K-12 would not be legal. (It's different at the university level because you can decide not to attend a university at all, but you can't opt not to attend K-12.)</p>
<p>What you might be thinking of is how the new superintendent, who just took office yesterday, said he might issue a mask mandate in Palm Beach County schools, after the previous superintendent said he would make masks optional. All the COVID policies in Palm Beach County schools are made solely by the superintendent. The previous superintendent originally said he was going to resign effective in October, but it seems like some pro-mask members of the school board might have forced him to resign early because they wanted a mask mandate in county schools.</p>
