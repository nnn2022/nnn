        <p>It's all just an exciting "happening" to them. COVID is exciting. "Surviving" COVID is even more exciting. They are LARPing like this is an extinction-level event and they've been able to survive solely because of their intelligence and precautionary behavior. So of course they're gonna take the vaccine. It's just another part of the "happening." In March 2020 they were posting memes about toilet paper shortages on social media. In May/June they were talking about George Floyd and BLM. Now they're talking about their vaccines. Whatever the media promotes, that's what they think about and talk about.</p>

<p>These people don't even realize they have been made sick. If there is no virus in the damn vaccines it shouldn't be doing this to people. They are having the same symptoms I get from my autoimmune diseases.</p>

        <p>Is she trying to blame her reaction on CVS? Unsafe vaccination centers? lmmfao. I've noticed so many rona vaxxed people stating they can't get comfortable at night. I can't say I've ever had that experience with any illnesses. Usually all I can do is sleep and that's the only time I get relief. She keeps taking advil too. I heard ibuprofen was a no-no with rona way in the beginning. Also I try my absolute best to NOT take a fever reducer when my body is producing a fever in order to kill whatever foreign substance is in my body.</p>

        <p>She's so brainwashed, she believes she "caught" Covid just by walking into the vaccination center, and that's why the vaccine is whipping her ass. I read today about some guy who said he couldn't sleep for 4 days. These vaccinations are basically giving all these people autoimmune reactions, that is why the side effects are so VARIED and they can't figure it out.</p>

        <p>I have Hashimotos. Some people get MULTIPLE autoimmune disorders, once your health goes, you can get SEVERAL. I may even explore genetic testing soon so much is wrong. I am glad you do not have it. I read up on studies and plan to show them to my doctor to tell him I have suffered enough. Don't get it, I believe there are going to be autoimmune nightmares as a result coming if not out and out death and infertility.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that. I've had symptoms of fibromyalgia for years, but they mostly go away as long as I keep myself as fit as possible. I can't enjoy massages because if they're too hard they make me want to throw up. I have friends who are practically bedridden with it. It's really scary. Marijuana seems to help at least. </p>
<p>When I first researched coronavirus vaccines and why none have ever been introduced, I learned about ADE. That is my biggest fear with this "vaccine". Autoimmune is my second. And now we see reports of all types of deadly reactions to these shots. Sudden heart failure, heart attacks, blood clots, failure of the blood to clot, anaphylaxis....the list goes on😔</p>

        <p>Thanks. I am glad you can keep fibromyalgia controlled. I am disabled but my health is deteriorating from the stress of this and extreme isolation outside of my husband. Yes fibro can make people bedridden. I learned about ADE too and went into the earlier mrna studies. Moderna has never made a FDA approved medicine and ended mRNA trials for other diseases pushing into vaccines over safety issues. Autoimmune is my biggest fear, I have one condition that could go into full lupus and it is showing signs. Yes when they censor the outcomes and silence people that means there is a giant problem. Even young and formerly healthy people are dying all over. Who knows what long term may bring. I do think of conspiracies about depopulation and I find myself thinking why was this all allowed to happen.</p>

        <p>The infertility is the one that scares me. I had to go through infertility treatments for years. I have two bio children (and for other medical reasons, I can't have any more), but I know the fear and the heartbreak of not knowing if you were going to have kids and having a miscarriage. I am genuinely afraid that a lot of women are going to subject themselves to the same thing.</p>

        <p>I believe it's going to make them infertile, it's already doing weird shit with periods. I was not able to have children due to health reasons, mostly infertile. Some are young now but don't know how they could be destroying their lives in the future.</p>

        <p>I have a friend who has been hyper vigilant about covid "precautions," and she works in a medical practice, so she's around covid patients. She went to get vaccinated and was sick for over two weeks, the sickest she's been in her life (she said), and she tested negative for covid but positive for both influenza A and influenza B (!!!). She's convinced she got it at the hospital when she got  vaccinated, because it's the only place she's been aside from work.</p>

        <p>I kept hearing people talk about the Covid vaccine making them sicker then they ever have been in their life. Funny how she managed not to get sick but when she got the vaccine, it went so wrong.</p>

        <p>Biggest bullshit in the world. The immune system is fighting a "foreign invader" aka POISON. No one gives a damn too, about the fact I have severe autoimmune illness and they all expect me to line up. I've even gone deaf from one.</p>
