    <p><p>“The most annoying part about all this is that once it blows over, the anti-vaxxers/maskers and overall covid deniers will just say that no problems existed in the first place and it passed naturally. There'll be no revelations for them, they'll condescendingly act like they were right all along - brushing off all the effort we've put into keeping ourselves safe and all those around us”</p></p>

        <p>Yep: Inaccurate PCR tests being run at too many cycles and used for a purpose they were not intended for.</p>
<p>Doctors forgetting to take into account whether people had other conditions that were leading them toward the end of their lives in a short amount of time.</p>
<p>I could keep on going here.</p>
<p>Honestly I think most of the deaths were from HCQ+Zinc and Ivermectin being pooh-pooh'd by the government, even though we now know that both do fight against CoVid quite well.</p>
