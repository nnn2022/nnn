        <p>Interesting that in a similarly short interview, Edward Snowden expresses the exact same worry as Agamben, even though in slightly different words: </p>

        <p>FYI, a simple mechanism for instituting the new normal, in a comment I made elsewhere about Agamben &amp; Snowden: </p>
<p>&rt;the pivoting required is very simple: instead of using the comparison with the flu to dismiss Covid, they can turn it on its head to say: "looking back, we have been barbaric in letting people die of flu and other respiratory viruses every year: these are preventable deaths and there's no excuse to return to the old normal. Some basic hygiene with which we are all getting accustomed - wear masks all the time, socially distance, and the occasional lockdown - and those deaths can be prevented".</p>
<p>&rt;So there's very little extravaganza required to redeploy the Covid management paradigm to respiratory viruses in general and the flu in particular. Since these are endemic, so is the emergency state, aka totalitarianism China-style. You have a justification to keep the state of emergency pretty much all the time, because we know better now and we are better people than our ancestors of 2019 and before.</p>

        <p>That's very tight. Very greasy.</p>
<p>I actually heard that argument from a friend, in all seriousness. I pointed out that we did not mandate universal mask-wearing in the last 3 comparable pandemics. He replied, "we should have".</p>
<p>At that point you just say, "fuck no!", because rationality is out the window.  And keep your gun close.</p>

<p>Have you seen that bone chilling video with the kids who want masks? Lemme see if I can find it. </p>
<p>I can't find it. It was posted here a few months ago. </p>
<p>Music = Willy Wonka "Pure Imagination". Little kids who cried when you pulled off their mask. Babies who struggled to keep their face covered.</p>
