    <strong>Short Story: The Sun Never Shines On TV</strong>
    <p><p>Hello all, I'm back from my 3 day "holiday". I'm going to eschew my usual rant format here and try out something different. I've hastily written this super-edgy, dystopian short-story for shits and giggles. Hope you all enjoy.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>“Holy shit, another one? This is turning into a fuckin' pandemic... well, don't just stand there, cut him down.”   </p>
<p>A heavy sigh escaping him yet not penetrating through the forcefield of multi-layered fibre and fabric cupping his face, D.I. Sam Calvin couldn't help but turn away from the pale, bloated body being hoisted down from the noose by his fellow masked officers. He had made eye contact with the hanging cadaver for the briefest of moments, it's bulging, bloodshot eyes glazed and lifeless. He had stared into the abyss and it had reciprocated. “Lucky bastard”, he'd grimly thought to himself, jealousy rippling through his partially paralysed body.</p>
<p>In the corner of the squat, cramped isolation pod, the requisite television set dutifully played, the glow from the flickering screen illuminating it's dead owner's slightly swaying, milky legs, a shrill, Dalek-like voice blaring out the latest news and death rates in a ceaseless loop over stock images of body-bags, overwhelmed hospitals, and desolate streets. </p>
<p>“FORTY CASES REPORTED IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND,” squalled the disembodied voice at ear-shattering volume, “TWO DEATHS WITH COVID-19 ON THE CERTIFICATE. THE PRIME MINISTER HAS DELCARED AN IMMEDIATE TIER-10 LOCKDOWN AND CURFEW. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN VACCINATED ARE PERMITTED TO LEAVE THEIR SLEEPING QUARTERS FOR MEAL-TIMES, BUT ARE URGED TO TAKE EXTREME CAUTION AND KEEP THEIR MASKS ON AT ALL TIMES.” </p>
<p>The all too familiar voice irked Calvin, leading him to distractedly and painfully scratch with his one working hand at the pustular vaccine scars clustering his dead-arm. Distressed by the purple, almost black, discoloration bruising his arm, and the nauseating smell of rotting flesh emanating from his crippled appendage, Calvin had voiced his concerns to the Station's resident doctor, who had reassured him that it was a perfectly natural reaction to the vaccine and that it was to be expected.</p>
<p>The two officers handling the corpse laid it flat on the floor of the isolation pod, pushing aside a table strewn with brochures and pamphlets relating to the current pandemic. Buried amongst the paraphernalia and propaganda, a battered and worn copy of George Orwell's dystopian novel “1984” unearthed itself in the shuffle. Calvin couldn't believe his eyes, and had an overwhelming urge to snatch the now-outlawed book for himself, to preserve it for future generations, if there ever were any. Mass-infertility was beginning to be widely reported, after all (though, as the news emphatically stated, this was unrelated to the vaccine). </p>
<p>Just as quickly as he'd clamped eyes on the illegal novella, it was cruelly and unceremoniously plucked from reach and wrenched from view by a pair of tongs, held in the gloved hands of a Covid compliance officer, and disposed of into a sealed pouch, the label “RACISM” hastily and lazily slapped on the container. The compliance officer locked eyes with Calvin, tongs raised and face-shield glinting, his eyes crinkling with what Calvin took to be perverse pleasure. It was hard to tell what anyone was feeling any more, in a World without mouths. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson's haggard and withered face filled the television screen, his shock of grey hair providing a fuzzy halo above his head. He somberly addressed the nation from behind a podium fitted with plexi-glass, his eyes moist and glassy with false-empathy and false-promises.    “We here at Number 10 are deeply, deeply saddened and, er, deeply troubled by the recent up-tick in suicides sweeping across, er, Britain, this, uh, great country. Our current concern is of course Covid, but we are looking into this matter. Experts on mental health and societal behaviors are being consulted as we speak, and we are treating this matter very, very seriously. We intend to get to the bottom of whatever is causing this nationwide, uh, depression. I, like many of you, am looking forward to getting out of this current lock-down and enjoying a nice cold pint down the local watering hole with my fellow human beings. It has been a hard seven years, but we must press on. Only by working together will we defeat the virus. So, remember: stay home, wear a mask, protect the NHS.” </p>
<p>The weather report followed the Prime Minister's announcement: as always, contrary to the nice, sunny weather outside, the television warned of torrential downpours and gale force winds. “A storm is brewing on the horizon”, the weatherman squawked, blazing, hate-filled eyes peeking atop his multiple face-masks and burrowing into the news camera. He urged those lucky enough to have shopping-permits to wear at least five layers of clothing, alongside their government-mandated masks, when travelling to and from the shops.    </p>
<p>“Great,” scoffed Murphy, one of Calvin's fellow officers, his words muffled by his mask and hazmat suit, “more people dying of Covid-related heat-stroke. Just what we fucking need.” </p>
<p>“What do you mean 'great'? My third-cousin's boyfriend's grandfather died of Covid-related heat-stroke! It's not something to joke about, you fucking bigot!” seethed Roberts, Murphy's (now former) friend and partner. “I'm going straight to HR with this!” </p>
<p>Murphy desperately scrambled for an explanation for his outburst, spluttering out apologies and begging Roberts for forgiveness. Calvin closed his eyes, knowing the futility of Murphy's protests all too well. His fate was sealed; he'd be immediately stripped of his badge, uniform, and passports for his dissent and mockery of the weather report. Life for Murphy would not be worth living, and before long they'd be cutting his body down from the rafters. Roberts would probably post on social media about it for attention and sympathy. </p>
<p>Shuffling past the warring officers with a stretcher, two dancing paramedics loaded the stiff onto a stretcher and hauled it away, the stretcher and body ghoulishly bobbing up and down rhythmically with the pop music blasting from the lead paramedic's phone. Calvin watched it go, wondering to himself if it had Covid in it's system and whether it would be added to the statistics. Regardless, his act of suicide would probably be labelled a “noble sacrifice” by the media. </p>
<p>A program promoting a “healthy body image”, comprised of rotund celebrities and obese models body-shaming thin people, was mercifully interrupted by a screaming alarm overhead. Murphy and Roberts ceased their argument immediately, and dutifully joined Calvin outside the isolation pod. The doors to the other isolation pods lining the corridor swung open, the occupants stepping out onto their stoops in tandem, armed with pots, pans and other implements. </p>
<p>“COMMENCE CLAPPING”, the alarm shrieked. </p>
<p>A cacophony of claps, drums and bangs echoed and rebounded down the corridor, wooden spoons splintering against metal pans, clap-calloused hands slapping harshly and rawly against each other, hard enough to draw blood, a choir of hate-filled screams and whistles accompanying the racket. In the center of the corridor, the paramedics were clapping alongside everyone else; they had dropped the stretcher instinctively at the sound of the alarm, and the body had spilled out. It lay askew in the hallway, tongue lolling out, pale, dead eyes staring obscenely out at its former neighbors. </p>
<p>Through the fogged up visor of Murphy's hazmat suit, Calvin could make out beads of sweat trickling down Murphy's harsh, rage-filled face. Anxious as he was, Murphy was clapping and screaming with the best of them. No amount of clapping, no matter how fervent or loud, would save him now. Calvin shook his head, but continued to clap, his good hand knocking numbly against his limp, arthritic claw of a hand.</p>
<p>At the two minute mark, the clapping tapered off, with only the most zealous and virtuous left howling and clattering their cutlery. Down the far end of the hall, a stoop was left unattended and unclapped. Calvin's eyes narrowed on the open doorway, and a trembling hand closed on his truncheon. He stalked down the corridor, flanked by Murphy and Roberts, people parting like the red sea and darting into their isolation pods on their approach.   </p>
<p>Roberts drew his radio and whispered perversely into it: “Dealing with a non-compliant and possible sociopath.” </p>
<p>“Act appropriately, officers,” the radio crackled. </p>
<p>Calvin slid his truncheon out from its leather sheath and gave it a practice swing, appreciating the weight and heft behind it. Murphy and Roberts followed suit. Years ago, before Covid, Calvin had frequented nightclubs and enjoyed an active social life; now, this was the only kind of clubbing he was permitted to do, and he was damned if he didn't enjoy it. </p>
<p>Soft, cowed chants of “ACAB” sizzled out from behind closed doors as the officers passed by. Roberts lashed out with his club at a nearby fire hydrant, cracking it and spilling its foamy guts across the carpeted floor, silencing the chants. The officers approached the open door with extreme caution, taking tentative steps towards what could be the home of a bio-terrorist and granny killer.</p>
<p>Calvin rounded the corner and entered the hollow of the doorway. He was greeted with a familiar sight: a hung body - another suicide - and the television set belching out the latest news and death figures. Calvin's grip on his truncheon loosened and his heart sank in his chest. He turned to Murphy and Roberts, perplexed and confused.     </p>
<p>“What the fuck's going on here?”</p></p>
