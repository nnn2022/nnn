    <strong>A different perspective, a chance.</strong>
    <p><p>Hi you lovely people (and mods! ü§úü§õ).
Times are rough atm, especially for the minority that we are, so here's a thingie that everyone is talking about recently.</p>
<p>So what the title means, lets explain right here to ease on mods if i am on illegal territory with my post here and a tl;dr for those who do not have time:</p>
<p>It is a link about GameStop (GME) corporation where a guy summarized it pretty well, put in words for new people to understand what is going on. This might completely change our economy, even crash the market or bring a huge inflation soon and is much bigger than what it looked like at first.
So i thought to spread the awareness, pls don't ban, my place is with you people, nowhere else to go.
Also few words how our dear Bill may have made a mistake and is managed to save what he has left, thank god, i mean that man he's such a role model, right? (...)
A chance to get richer included.</p>
<p>So, i follow it for a few months now and folks at r/Superstonk are also very lovely people so me being me, let's try to connect the two and add a perspective to this whole situation as i mentioned it in the title.</p>
<p>Talking about Bill and his divorce recently, people saying he was a good friend with Epstein and was paying him a visits regularly and that is the reason Melinda divorced him, but according to some he was also deeply invested in GME and is a good friend with Ken Griffin, CEO of Citadel who is in internet's crosshair recently for manipulating the market and more.</p>
<p>So following the news, iirc, i've learned weeks ago that Bill transfered $1.82bil to his ex wife's account, and i wondered why, so after i've found few days ago that him and Ken are friends, dots connected and seems that Bill is also caught naked there and later divorced his wifey and deposited his stash to a safe place, his ex's account that is.</p>
<p>So now that we know more how Toni got exposed about financing his lab in Wuhan and now this mentioned above, i see a chance (title) to see more people smiling.</p>
<p>Know that this is not a financial advice, just shedding some light on the idea we are occupied with, at best you should not listen to me, as i'm probably crazy, and should do your own research first.
So follow r/Superstonk and learn as we go if you like this.</p>
<p>If there is a chance to invest few hundred and get million(s), would you take it?</p>
<p>Enjoy:</p>

        <p>The GME debacle is actually how I realized that the media had been completely compromised. I knew they had major biases but had no idea they were blatant liars. I love to play in the market and the sub, wallstreetbets was the only one I ever visited on Reddit. The amount of corruption in the market opened my eyes to the amount of corruption in the US in general. With the markets foundation cracking, it does make you wonder more about the financial connection between the ‚Äúvirus‚Äù and the state of the US economy prior to it.</p>

        <p>Yea agree, it just confirmed what was known for a while, that,  and the fact that all media, newspapers, tv, radio stations is all owned by 6 families, speaks volumes what is going on behind the scenes</p>

        <p>Yeah, it‚Äôs quite disappointing. There is so much corruption but I love our country so fiercely. It‚Äôs sad that the media is deliberately dividing our country and Americans just sit back and go for it. Very disappointing.</p>
