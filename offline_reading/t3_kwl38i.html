    <strong>I just have to get this off my chest and I feel like this is the only place I can.</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, I know that in the whole scheme of things, this shouldn't be a big deal to me, but it is. It really bothers me.</p>
<p>I started "college" (all online) this year, and I was planning on moving out, but since it's all online, I still live with my dad. He knows (or at least by now he should) full well my feelings on this. I am against pretty much all responses to the virus. Lockdowns, antisocial distancing, and especially the muzzles. The other things make my blood boil too, but not like muzzles. That crosses an even further line, by telling me what I am to wear just to participate in society, just to go to a store to buy food, just to go to a doctor, just to do basically any normal thing. I have not worn a muzzle, not once since this started and they will never get me to comply.</p>
<p>Anyway, my dad considers himself "somewhat compliable" as he calls it, but I would call it more than "somewhat." He doesn't agree with forcing people to wear muzzles, and they are annoying to him to wear, but he does because he's worried about the virus and because "it's the rules" (bullshit it is) and "sometimes you just have to grin and bear it" and "sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do." Whenever he says things like that, it just drives me insane. The government has no right to do this; it's tyranny, I'm not going to "grin and bear it" and having to do things you don't want to do, that's like cleaning the house, paying bills, doing work. It's not giving up your freedom and being a doormat to the government just to do something other than be a prisoner of your own home. There are plenty of things I do because I have to that I don't want to do, but this ain't gonna be one of them.</p>
<p>I don't really go out at all, not because of the draconian measures (although that does discourage me) but because I have no driver's license since I wanted to wait until I turned 18 but that's when the virus started. So to go anywhere, it would have to be with him, and he'll wear a muzzle as soon as someone tells him to, and I don't want to be around him to see him be a slave to the government. I just couldn't stand to see it on him because of the ridiculousness. Another thing is he would give me hell for not wearing a muzzle because I'd be "breaking the law" (Even though I'm not breaking the law, I'm breaking the tyranny) so I don't go places.</p>
<p>Anyway, he thinks that the reason I don't go places is because of these fake "rules." Not at all. If I could drive or if he wasn't in the picture, I'd be fine going places, bare face of course since I'm not insane, and of course I'd probably have some problems with some of the Nazis, but I WILL stand up for my rights and I'm not going to let anyone force tyranny on me. I'd go places and not let the tyranny stop me. But I don't because of him. The reason I don't go places isn't because "they won't let me" (even though they have no right to stop me) or to keep my dad appeased but because I don't need him giving me hell too.</p>
<p>It just bothers me a lot that he thinks tyrannical fake "rules" would stop me and that he doesn't realize that it's him. That the reason I don't go places is because "I'm not allowed" so I'm just like "Fine, I'm not allowed, so I won't do it." That he doesn't think I would ever defy. But the only thing keeping me from going places bare face is him, not the government. It just disappoints me that he thinks I'm just not going anywhere because "it's the rules" and that I wouldn't defy because I'm a "good person" who doesn't break the "rules." Were it not for him, I'd go tons of places and never let the tyranny rule me, and I'd find ways around it, and I'd live my life as a free woman despite all the sheep, but because of him, I just don't, and I hate that he doesn't understand that. Not necessarily that I want him out of my way, just that I wish he'd understand that I will fight against this, not just ignore it by not going places. Because to me, not going places because you won't wear a muzzle is still being half-compliant, and I don't want anyone to think for a second that I won't defy this idiocy. </p>
<p>Sorry that was so long and I know it was very rambling and whining, but I just had to get it out after all this time and this is the only place I can. If you read all that, thank you so much, I really appreciate it.</p></p>

        <p>You place too much responsbility on your dad and too little on yourself. Go get that license (yes, wear the muzzle at the DMV if you must), get a job, move out. If you want to live authentically you have to be willing to face some hardship.</p>

        <p>Believe me when I say I face hardship every day. I will never wear a muzzle, I will always find a way around it. I want to live authentically, but putting on a muzzle is something I'd never forgive myself for. I do face hardship through people who try to tell me that I "just need to give in" or "adapt" or "that's just the way it is now" and when I'm at work. I am a martial arts instructor and they're not muzzle Nazis, but I get complaints from people that I dare to show my face. People wanting me fired. I've lost lifelong friends over this.</p>
<p>I am going to move out as soon as possible and get a license (without the muzzle of course). I know that my situation sucks because I can't drive; if I could, this would all be different. I'm not placing any responsibility on my dad; I never ask him to do anything, I'm just saying I wish he'd understand me better. I am doing everything I can to live on my own as soon as possible, it's just that today I hit a breaking point and had to let this out since I've been keeping it in all this time, and seeing as this is the only place I could do it without too much backlash, I chose here.</p>
<p>I'm not asking you to agree with me, I'm not asking anyone to read my long post, I just had to get it out to whomever wanted to listen. And I'm sorry, but the thing about responsibility just isn't true. I'm doing everything I can to leave and go out on my own, I never ask my dad to do anything for me, I just wish he understood me, and I face hardship every day since being anti-tyranny isn't exactly the popular thing to be right now. I know all about hardship. But giving in to the tyranny just isn't going to happen.</p>

        <p>I know that, as I've said, I do plenty of things I have to do that I don't want to do, but there are some things that I just will not put up with, and tyranny is one of them. If we don't fight this, we're never getting our freedom back. Most of the things I do every day I really don't want to do. But taking away my basic freedoms is where I draw the line. I'm not asking to do "whatever I want." I'm asking to have my rights, that's all. That's not much to ask.</p>

<p>Tyranny isn't just about censoring the internet. It's about closing down small businesses while letting Walmart stay open next door. It's about telling people who they can invite into their own homes. It's about preventing young people from having a social life in what should be the best time of their lives.</p>

        <p>A lot of cultures wear facial garments. Even in north american culture men often wear hats that cover a lot of their face.</p>
<p>The point is you're pretending that the government hasn't always had control over what you have to wear. There are people that have the same issue with other clothing laws that you have with masks. It's not completely different just because it now effects you personally.</p>

        <p>Ok? I don't think people shouldnt wear masks if they want to wear one. Just that the government has no place mandating certain types of clothing. I dont really think your point makes mine any weaker.</p>
