        <p>US education was designed to manipulate and indoctrinate the population to believe certain narratives. The more education someone has, usually the more convinced they are of such narrative. There are less free-thinkers in higher education... as backwards as that sounds.</p>

        <p>Medical education and research were taken over by Rockefeller Syndicate snake oil salesmen over 100 years ago. These elitists were/are eugenicists. They teamed up with the hucksters in the American Medical Association (AMA) to build a protection racket for their corrupt Pharma cartel. </p>
<p>Long before vaccines and antibiotics, infectious diseases had mostly faded away due to sanitation, hygiene etc. This would be bad for the business interests of the AMA and Pharma. </p>
<p>&rt;”In the <strong>great majority of cases</strong> the toll of the <strong>major killing diseases of the nineteenth century declined dramatically before the discovery of medical cures and even immunization</strong> ^1</p>
<p>&rt;”Similarly, for England and Wales <strong>John Powles shows that overall mortality declined</strong> over the last hundred years <strong>well in advance of specific immunizations and therapies.</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, our eugenics-loving overlords desired to cull “useless eaters.” So they started seeding the population with diseases, various cancers via SV40 contaminated vaccines and ushering in newer autoimmune diseases.  In this way, they can cull the weak, control through fear of disease and make money.  Props up all their interests.</p>

<p><strong>Pharma: History of Corruption</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/21/obituaries/rene-dubos-scientist-and-writer-dead.html">Rene Dubos, the microbiologist</a> formerly with the Rockefeller Institute, succinctly summed up the historical record. <strong>”The tide of infectious and nutritional diseases was rapidly receding when the laboratory scientist moved into action at the end of the past century,"</strong> Dubos wrote in Mirage of Health. "In reality," he observed, <strong>”the monstrous specter of infection had become but an enfeebled shadow of its former self by the time serums, vaccines, and drugs became available to combat microbes.</strong>” ^1</p>
<p>&rt;”World renowned microbiologist, <strong>Professor Rene Dubos</strong> has acknowledged that the <strong>decline in mortality</strong> caused by infections <strong>“began almost a century ago</strong> and has continued ever since at a <strong>fairly constant rate irrespective of the use of any specific therapy.</strong> The effect of <strong>antibacterial drugs is but a ripple on the wave</strong> which has been wearing down the mortality caused by infection in our communities". ^2</p>
<p>&rt;Professor <strong>Dubos has further stated:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”Modern Science’s role in defeating infectious diseases has been greatly exaggerated.</strong> Many of the most terrifying leprosy, plague, typhus, - had all but <strong>disappeared</strong> from Europe <strong>before serums, vaccines, and drugs</strong> were developed to combat them".  <strong>Ivan lilich in his book, Medical Nemesis, writes:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;"The study and evolution of disease patterns provides evidence that during the last century <strong>doctors have affected such patterns no more profoundly than did priests during earlier times. Epidemics came and went, imprecated by both and untouched by either.</strong> They are not modified any more profoundly by the rituals performed in medical clinics than by the exorcisms customary at religious shrines.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”The combined death rate from scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough, and measles among children up to fifteen, shows that nearly 90 per cent of the total decline in mortality between 1860 and 1965 had occurred before the introduction of antibiotics and widespread immunization."</strong> (in reference to the UK).”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>“Many so-called "medical discoveries",</strong> however, have been <strong>announced by the Rockefeller Institute.</strong> Among them have been the supposed "discoveries" of the organisms that cause infantile paralysis, smallpox, mumps, measles and yellow fever; and the "discovery" of preventive vaccines for pneumonia and yellow fever.  <strong>All of these "discoveries" announced by the Institute have proved false.</strong> But most of them have served definite and <strong>profitable purposes</strong> and have been <strong>exploited commercially</strong> and intensively.” ^3</p>
<p>&rt;”Few back then grasped that these <strong>vaccines might also be a huge, inadvertent, uncontrolled experiment in interspecies viral transmission.</strong> But from <strong>1955 to 1963,</strong> according to a 1976 US National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded study, <strong>98 million Americans alone probably were exposed to polio vaccines contaminated with SV40—a monkey virus that can cause cancers in animals.”</strong> ^4</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”By 1960, scientists and vaccine manufacturers knew</strong> that monkey kidneys were sewers of simian viruses. Such contamination often spoiled cultures, including those of an NIH researcher named <strong>Bernice Eddy,</strong> who worked on vaccine safety.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>”As of 2003, SV40 had been found in human tumours in 18 developed countries.</strong> Bookchin and Schumacher claim that <strong>the rates of SV40-positive tumours seem highest in countries that used the greatest amount of contaminated Salk polio vaccine</strong>, including the UK, USA, and Italy.”</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>"Harry Nelson, Medical Editor for L.A. Times, reported</strong> on an American Cancer Society Seminar for Science Writers, and announced that <strong>microbiologists have uncovered new findings that incriminate vaccination.</strong> One of the participants was <strong>Dr. Robert M. Simpson of Rutgers University, N.J.,</strong> who stressed that <strong>‘Immunization programs against flu, measles, mumps, and polio may actually be seeding humans with RNA to form proviruses which will then become latent cells throughout the body</strong> ...Some of these could be molecules in search of a disease, which under proper conditions become activated and <strong>cause a variety of diseases</strong> including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus erythematosus, Parkinson’s disease <strong>and perhaps cancer."</strong> This quote is from the Honorof Report for June, 1976.” ^5</p>
<p>&rt;##“DOCTOR FORESEES A NATION OF INVALIDS</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Dr. S. S. Goldwater, New York Commissioner of Hospitals</strong> pointed out in The Modern Hospital Magazine that the <strong>present measures used</strong> to check contagious diseases <strong>may permit of longer life — but not of stronger life. As a result of the drugs, vaccines and other suppressive treatments</strong> used to check diseases, <strong>he says that, "chronic diseases are growing at such a rate</strong> that America may become a nation of invalids. <strong>Over half the hospital beds are filled with chronic sufferers, both old and young."</strong> (from Health Practitioner’s Journal, June, 1944)” ^6</p>
<p>&rt;”Medical records prove that a <strong>90% decline</strong> in child mortality from scarlet fever, diptheria, whooping cough and measles occurred <strong>before the introduction of antibiotics and immunization,</strong> from 1860-1896. ^7</p>
<p>&rt;”I read what prominent men of science, medical officers for health, and doctors wrote about vaccination and its sequelae that never made it into today’s textbooks, and found out what anyone with even a passing acquaintance with disease figures of the 19th and 20th century knew. For example, by the 1950s when the whooping cough vaccine was introduced, data showed that whooping cough was killing only 1 percent of the numbers of people who used to die in England and Wales 50 years before. ^8</p>
<p>&rt;Official data showed that the same happened with measles. Indeed, <strong>when the measles vaccine was introduced to the UK in 1968, the death rate continued to drop steadily, even though the initial uptake of the vaccine was only 30 percent</strong> and didn’t get above 50 percent until the 1980s.”</p>
<p>&rt;”Doctors Kalokerinos and Dettman (Australasian Nurses Journal June 1981) point out: ^2</p>
<p>&rt;"A careful study of the decline in disease will show that up to 90% of the so called ‘killer diseases’ had all but disappeared when we introduced immunizations on a large scale during the late thirties and early forties. Since the introduction of routine immunizations we now have an ever alarming increase of degenerative diseases and maladies, but worse still the diseases we are supposed to be protected from still occur, probably in larger numbers than we might have expected them to, had we simply allowed the declining disease rate to continue".</p>

        <p>You're skipping around that chart, that's not how you find a pattern.</p>
<p>I've got a degree in law and medicine, I'm from the DC area but lived in KY last year and now AZ.  I'm not getting the vaccine because I'm not a high risk age and the vaccine is too new to understand any lasting side effects.  It takes approximately 10 years.  I also have vaccines that most don't so I'm not anti vax.  My point is that I don't fit into your narrative and niether does anyone else.</p>
<p>You want a pattern?  Look at the political climate and culture of an area vs vaccine numbers.  Conservatives believe everyone had a choice and let's them make it, the political cultures in red areas tend to be of the personal choice and freedom point of view.  So no lockdowns or pressure. Blue areas have all locked down substantially more and demand more of the population and culturally these areas do what they're told by their "tribe."  People with a choice sometimes choose no, people without one or without the ability to use critical thinking to govern a choice usually choose what they're told to.</p>

        <p>I need like 2 more classes to have an English degree and I can't bring myself to do it lol. I only wanted it to teach abroad but now I want to go for something better in a different state once I leave California. The shit my partner has to take for engineering...and no one can question it in discussions where the professor is around because they need the good grade. </p>
<p>If you come out of college believing this horseshit, <em>you're</em> the dumb one because half the other students <em>did</em>  question it, they just keep their mouths shut to get the A and graduate on time. It's all at home online so I can hear them complaining in their peer groups about it every time she has class. Engineers are more logical people than these gender studies experts though, the classes actually take hours of study.</p>
