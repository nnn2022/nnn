    <strong>So trump has covid, but let me get this straight</strong>
    <p><p>We are supposed to not trust his doctors because they lie, but trust Mike Meadows on his expert health opinions. But doctors everywhere else are experts and you can’t question them</p>
<p>But it’s also a total hoax, he doesn’t have covid at all it’s a political stunt but also his videos posted to Twitter are edited to remove coughing. </p>
<p>He got covid because he wasn’t wearing a mask, yet the point of the masks is to prevent people with covid from spreading it, not to prevent the wearer from getting it. </p>
<p>He is going to die obviously because they admitted him to the hospital and have thrown every drug at him, so he must be in terrible condition. Even though he is the leader of the most powerful and wealthy nation on the planet. </p>
<p>Old people are DYING!!! Just 1 life matters. Except this one. </p>
<p>I’m not even a republican and I’ve never voted for the man, and I find some of his policies to not be good. But the rhetoric around him having Covid is absolutely full of shit and it’s amazing that it is getting to the front page multiple times a day. </p>
<p>95% chance of survival worst case btw</p>
<p>Edit: trump is irresponsible for driving around outside with covid and a mask on in a car with the windows rolled up, but masks are how we stop the spread  and if you don’t wear one you are killing grandma. And apparently according to some guys study below they stop the wearer from getting it now (another 180 from the CDC and WHO)</p></p>

        <p>It's funny, before like 2010 Trump was very well liked by almost everyone. It wasn't until he started to get involved in running for political office that all these morons started turning on him.</p>

        <p>NYCer here. Trump wasn't exactly well liked prior to entering politics, but he was seen as one particularly asshole-ish real estate developer among many similar scumbags. And it wasn't moronic to turn on him once he entered politics, because that was when he started saying a lot of really racist shit in front of national news cameras. By this time, though, the news media is much less interested in hating him for his actual bad acts (such as forced sterilization of women in immigrant detention centers) than because he's getting in the way of their fear porn around covid (see: the "he told people to inject disinfectant" lie).</p>

        <p>Pretty much true. His haters are fucking annoying since they can't go a conversation without bringing him and shit unrelated to politics. That and they like to guilt trip people for not spending every moment of their life hating trump. It's like they don't get that trump won't be around forever and there's more to life than politics. </p>
<p>Still i hope he recovers</p>

        <p>RIGHT...because Trump definitely pays his taxes and doesn’t assault women.  His policies are definitely designed to help the working class and his rhetoric isn’t full of racist dog whistles. Lousy untrustworthy media!  Where do they come up with this stuff!?</p>

        <p>The doomers just realized that Trump is in the highest risk group possible. Overweight and in his 70’s. So when he recovers, he will be perceived as being especially strong. Therefore, print media since yesterday has been using real data, and downplaying covid risks...trying to make it look like they just discovered that corona is just a new strain of the common cold and not that deadly after all. CNN and Reddit will shift to this narrative tomorrow. 
It’s remarkable and funny to watch...if it wasn’t so expensive and morbid  in terms of suffering (not allowed to visit people on their death bed, suicides, untreated cancers)...and an enormous amount of money. We’ll be paying for the lockdown for a generation. Two weeks!</p>

        <p>Considering COVID has been around since December 2019, it is a bloody miracle Trump did not get it earlier. Remember when the fear factor was high that it started going through members of Congress. Looks like it is doing it again. He didn't wear a mask for a long time. It seems like one of those things that eventually you get. Some people had it back in January or February but didnt get no free Corona time off or stimulus checks.</p>

President Trump and his staff are the most tightly controlled people in the world, and yet they caught it. If this is the case, it can obviously happen to anyone. But then this is a political disease, which seems tailor-made to benefit Democrats. It appeared at just the right time to damage President Trump's administration, and he caught it at just the right time to influence the November election. You'd think the Democrats intentionally arranged this to try and derail him.</p>
<p>President Trump proved that you can do everything imaginable to keep the most powerful man in the world healthy and the virus still wins. Masks mean nothing. Even people and families that were 100% locked down still got the virus. It’s not a death sentence. K</p>
<p>This proves that the people who propose letting it run its course may be correct. The swine flu ran its course and is a non issue now. Covid is no worse than a bad cold. Everyone will get it. We will survive this.</p>

<p>As we currently stand, 4% of people that get it die. </p>

<p>In the US, as it currently stands, the rate is 2.8%, but worldwide, it's 4% since this began. </p>
<p>We do that by taking the 210,000 dead people and divide it with the 7,440,000 people diagnosed and get 0.028 out of 1. 1= 100%, so if we multiply 0.028 with 100, we get the percentage, or 2.8%</p>
<p>It's pretty basic mathematics. 0.028 out of 1 = 2.8 out of 100. Or 2,800 out of 100,000.</p>

        <p>No, because it's 2.8% out of *confirmed* cases, not actual cases. Have you not seen the blood antibody studies? 5-10x more people have been exposed to this coronavirus since they were carrying antibodies to it at the time of the study.  Many people get it and have zero symptoms and don't get tested, or just assume it's a mild cold or allergies. This puts the actual death rate much, much lower than 2.8%.</p>

        <p>I can't access the NYT article, but it's interesting you sent me an article literally supporting my point...</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Fewer than one per cent of donors tested positive for antibodies</strong> to the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>&rt;These results offer insight into how common COVID-19 has been among  a relatively healthy subset of Canadians, and marks the end of the first phase of our ongoing seroprevalence study. Seroprevalence refers to the level of a pathogen in a population, measured in the blood. We are still learning about COVID-19 immunity, but <strong>the results indicate that the vast majority of individuals tested remain vulnerable to infection because very few individuals have antibodies against the virus.</strong></p>
<p>Could you perhaps copy the NYT article here?</p>

        <p>Can you link me some scientific studies that provide evidence of this? I would honestly love some peace of mind about it.</p>
<p>Based on what I've read masks don't stop anything except spittle, blood and mucus splatter going out. You would need to be in a hazmat suit for it to stop it. Most people are wearing cloth which stops 0 micro particles and improperly fitting surgical masks with gaping holes around their cheeks. It is airborne and air follows the path of least resistance right out the side of the surgical masks or straight through the cloth masks. N95 masks however may filter out some but even still most people are not wearing them properly to make a correct seal and even still the seal is broken when you exhale. These would probably be the most likely to actually help slow, not stop, any sort of transmission of COVID.  </p>
<p>Can someone please provide me studies to prove that I'm wrong. I want to be wrong but I can't help but feel the masks are an additional layer to the authoritarianism.</p>

        <p>My comment was sarcastic like the OP. It was showing the hypocrisy of people. The same people demanding that everyone wear masks because they're supposedly super effective are the same people criticizing Trump for doing a drive-by today and waving at supporters because he has covid, even though he was wearing a mask. Basically they change the narrative to fit whatever their cause is at the moment. </p>
<p>Masks are bullshit, the virus just isn't that bad.</p>

        <p>Yep that's pretty much it. As far as I know they stop BIG droplets from flying out and landing on surfaces that others touch. But the real menace with COVID spread (and all other similar virus spread) is the micro droplets that are light enough to linger in the air for a few seconds longer - long enough to be breathed in by someone nearby. And regular masks won't do jack shit to stop those ones since they're small enough to fly between fabric.</p>

        <p>It’s reckless because he is endangering the lives of his secret service who are trapped in an airtight vehicle with a COVID patient. Masks only help so much, and the type of mask Trump had on is one of the least effective at stopping the virus. </p>
<p>James Phillips, doctor of emergency medicine at George Washington University, who is an attending physician at Walter Reed, called the stunt “insanity”.
“Every single person in the vehicle during that completely unnecessary Presidential ‘drive-by’ just now has to be quarantined for 14 days. They might get sick. They may die,” he wrote in a tweet.</p>
<p>“For political theater. Commanded by Trump to put their lives at risk for theater. This is insanity.”
In a second tweet, Phillips added: “That Presidential SUV is not only bulletproof, but hermetically sealed against chemical attack. The risk of COVID19 transmission inside is as high as it gets outside of medical procedures. The irresponsibility is astounding. My thoughts are with the Secret Service forced to play.”</p>

        <p>If you're contagious, you definitely know you are sick with something and should wear a mask if you have to go out. If millions of virus particles are replicating, you will definitely feel it, in the form of symptoms.</p>
<p>PCR doesn't discriminate between dead and alive virus. If you test positive but have no symptoms it simply means there's some dead virus in the back of your throat/nose. </p>
<p>There's been plenty of studies that show asymptomatic cases, no study has come close to proving that asymptomatic people are contagious. Studies that prove asymptomatic cases /= proven asymptomatic transmission.</p>

        <p>Yea I’ll vote for him but it was just unnecessary to do that   Easily could’ve done it on his way out back to the White House. But they’re so stupid. They’re mad at this but didn’t he put the people flying Marine One at risk on Friday when they took him to the hospital. My friend is an EMT and came into contact with many covid patients, in and out of the hospital and never got it, neither did his girlfriend.  Every doctor who works in a hospital still goes home and can still go out and about.  I don’t get all this either   It was just unnecessary but I’m not sure he infected anyone lmao.  But it’s also ruining their mask narrative and the whole narrative behind this new normal bs</p>

        <p>Your friend and doctors fallow the safety procedures for dealing with COVID patients, that's why they aren't getting it. They likely aren't wearing some shitty blue mask or a cloth mask, they'll be wearing N95 masks. If anything it's highlighting the benefits of using a mask.</p>

        <p>Not trying to sound tin foil hat conspiracy theorist-y... But i'm wondering if the guy even has COVID. Part of me wonders if this is just a PR stunt to deflect from the horrible debate and the tax drama from last week... I mean, not only does this scrub that, but it makes Trump look like a resilient leader which might be a hail Mary to get his numbers back up in the polls.

        <p>Faking COVID could be part of his campaign to garner sympathy. Plus he's already left hospital, so idk this all seems a bit too sketchy. And in the car drive-by he wasn't even wearing an N95 mask (which i'd think they'd provide for him if he has an actual diagnosis so as to limit the infection to the driver and secret service presumably in the car with him). </p>
<p>Maybe he did have it. But I couldn't help but have a bit of skepticism given the circumstances.</p>

        <p>The problem with the theory is that the Trump administration is the leakiest administration in history. Every single person who works for him is lining up multiple massive book deals as soon as they leave, and nobody has been able to take a shit in the White House for four years because every toilet stall has been occupied by a staffer furiously hammering out texts to their favorite journos to gossip about what the orange man said today. </p>
<p>The Trump administration is incapable of keeping anyone's mouth shut. When three people meet, one of them tattles to a journo.</p>

        <p>It is classic Trump Derangement Syndrome. Everything Trump does or says gets spun to make him look like a horrible and evil person. TDS is partially to blame for what has driven the hysteria and the world is ending narrative in the US. The narrative of “We are in this horrible situation because the mean orange man in the White House downplayed the pandemic”.

        <p>I know you’ll probably just downvote me to oblivion, but on the off chance you want a good faith discussion of some of your questions:</p>
<p>We can’t trust his doctors because they aren’t allowed to tell us anything their patient doesn’t want them to tell. If they are completely transparent, against Trump’s instructions, that would violate HIPPA. </p>
<p>The people saying he doesn’t really have COVID are idiot conspiracy theorists. There are too many positive test among Republican higher-ups for that to be remotely plausible. </p>
<p>There is actual video of what was probably the super spreader event at the Rose Garden. Hardly anyone was wearing a mask, they weren’t distancing, they were hugging each other and wiping their noses with bare hands. Trump was not the only person in his orbit not wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>We are living in bizarro world.  The left literally cannot stop contradicting itself and making itself look foolish.  They scary thing is that they are 100% convinced that they are correct, and that everyone who doesn't agree with them is "literally" a Nazi or is nuts.  </p>
<p>TDS is a very real thing, and it's scary as hell.  They will say and do literally everything opposite of what Trump says, does, or advocates.  It's a very interesting study in their collective psychology and watching it shift in real time.  You can predict what they are going to say before they say it.  Crazy.</p>

        <p>How about I get this straight, you think that Trump, struggling to breath(https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/j5w6v7/trump_with_covid_having_trouble_breathing/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) made the right choice to leave the hospital where they were treating him so he didn't die. So you think he left because they were injecting him with chemicals and killing him when in reality he was on oxygen for two days.

        <p>Masks absolutely do protect the wearer from getting COVID. It’s been proven numerous times with legitimate research. They actually make a pretty significant difference. Not to mention that research shows they are also capable of lessening the severity of COVID if you do happen to still get it while wearing a mask. </p>

        <p>In a strictly controlled medical setting with trained professional use under sterile conditions, a mask may help. In no other circumstance have masks been shown to help whatsoever and there is no study at all which shows that masks help when used by the general public, especially not cloth face masks.  This site has a link to the studies showing that mask use is ineffective in the general public and that is backed up even further by showing that covid infections continued to increase, sometimes at an even faster rate, even after mandatory mask orders are enforced. </p>

        <p>I literally just linked the first 2 results from google on a page full of results. I figured you’d at least think “Hmm okay so there is evidence that supports the use of masks. Maybe I should look a little closer and do some googling myself.” But NOPE, you guys see sources of legitimate studies, don’t even bother reading them, and then disregard them as “weak”. I mean what the fuck more do you want? I’m on mobile so it’s not fun doing this, but here you go. </p>

        <p>I read the article and the study which it is based on. I mean we can go back and fourth all day with studies. You have to look at the mechanics of these studies and how they are performed. Hence my comment that the study is weak.
Here is some medical papers on masks. I am sharing it with since it's become such an emotional and unscientific debate amongst us plebs
Review of the Medical Literature
Here are key anchor points to the extensive scientific literature that establishes that wearing surgical masks and respirators (e.g., “N95”) does not reduce the risk of contracting a verified illness:</p>
<p>Jacobs, J. L. et al. (2009) “Use of surgical face masks to reduce the incidence of the common cold among health care workers in Japan: A randomized controlled trial,” American Journal of Infection Control, Volume 37, Issue 5, 417 – 419. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19216002</p>
<p>N95-masked health-care workers (HCW) were significantly more likely to experience headaches. Face mask use in HCW was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds.</p>
<p>Cowling, B. et al. (2010) “Face masks to prevent transmission of influenza virus: A systematic review,” Epidemiology and Infection, 138(4), 449-456. https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/face-masks-to-prevent-transmission-of-influenza-virus-a-systematic- review/64D368496EBDE0AFCC6639CCC9D8BC05</p>
<p>None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask, in either HCW or community members in households (H). See summary Tables 1 and 2 therein.</p>
<p>bin-Reza et al. (2012) “The use of masks and respirators to prevent transmission of influenza: a systematic review of the scientific evidence,” Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses 6(4), 257–267. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00307.x</p>
<p>“There were 17 eligible studies. … None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”</p>
<p>Smith, J.D. et al. (2016) “Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks in protecting health care workers from acute respiratory infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis,” CMAJ Mar 2016 https://www.cmaj.ca/content/188/8/567</p>
<p>“We identified six clinical studies … . In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in associated risk of (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, or (c) reported work-place absenteeism.”</p>
<p>Offeddu, V. et al. (2017) “Effectiveness of Masks and Respirators Against Respiratory Infections in Healthcare Workers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,” Clinical Infectious Diseases, Volume 65, Issue 11, 1 December 2017, Pages 1934–1942, https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/65/11/1934/4068747</p>
<p>“Self-reported assessment of clinical outcomes was prone to bias. Evidence of a protective effect of masks or respirators against verified respiratory infection (VRI) was not statistically significant”; as per Fig. 2c therein: </p>
<p>Radonovich, L.J. et al. (2019) “N95 Respirators vs Medical Masks for Preventing Influenza Among Health Care Personnel: A Randomized Clinical Trial,” JAMA. 2019; 322(9): 824–833. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749214</p>
<p>“Among 2862 randomized participants, 2371 completed the study and accounted for 5180 HCW-seasons. ... Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”</p>
<p>Long, Y. et al. (2020) “Effectiveness of N95 respirators versus surgical masks against influenza: A systematic review and meta-analysis,” J Evid Based Med. 2020; 1- 9. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jebm.12381</p>
<p>“A total of six RCTs involving 9,171 participants were included. There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks. Meta-analysis indicated a protective effect of N95 respirators against laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.43-0.78). The use of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks is not associated with a lower risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”</p>
<p>Conclusion Regarding That Masks Do Not Work
No RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. There are no exceptions.</p>
<p>Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public (more on this below).</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there were any benefit to wearing a mask, because of the blocking power against droplets and aerosol particles, then there should be more benefit from wearing a respirator (N95) compared to a surgical mask, yet several large meta-analyses, and all the RCT, prove that there is no such relative benefit.</p>
<p>Masks and respirators do not work.</p>
<p>Precautionary Principle Turned on Its Head with Masks
In light of the medical research, therefore, it is difficult to understand why public-health authorities are not consistently adamant about this established scientific result, since the distributed psychological, economic, and environmental harm from a broad recommendation to wear masks is significant, not to mention the unknown potential harm from concentration and distribution of pathogens on and from used masks. In this case, public authorities would be turning the precautionary principle on its head (see below).</p>
<p>Physics and Biology of Viral Respiratory Disease and of Why Masks Do Not Work
In order to understand why masks cannot possibly work, we must review established knowledge about viral respiratory diseases, the mechanism of seasonal variation of excess deaths from pneumonia and influenza, the aerosol mechanism of infectious disease transmission, the physics and chemistry of aerosols, and the mechanism of the so-called minimum-infective-dose.</p>
<p>In addition to pandemics that can occur anytime, in the temperate latitudes there is an extra burden of respiratory-disease mortality that is seasonal, and that is caused by viruses. For example, see the review of influenza by Paules and Subbarao (2017). This has been known for a long time, and the seasonal pattern is exceedingly regular.</p>

        <p>Well now I’m questioning everything. How the fuck am I supposed to know what to believe? Are we really this fucked already? I mean I’ll be honest, I’m not sifting through all of these studies to figure out exactly what’s going on with them, and I doubt you are either. Nobody has time for that shit. We’re supposed to have trusted scientists and doctors who do that for us. Are you saying that all of the “mainstream” doctors/scientists are being paid off to lie about the efficacy of masks? I just find that hard to believe. And for what purpose? What the fuck do they gain from making us wear masks?</p>

        <p>No man not all. First off thank you for engaging in a constructive manner. It's means alot to just have a normal conversation not filled with vitriol.
I think what you mentioned above comes down to the media. There is by no means a scientific consensus on masks. I find that the mainstream media attempts to say that all the science is settled and experts agree, which couldn't be further from the  truth. The experts are split down the middle. Same goes for drs and scientists. The difference being that one side is getting way more media attention then the other. One side is receiving funding and the other is not. Lots of professionals have been speaking out about this but barely register as a blip in the public sphere. We have about 60 years of research saying they don't work but now suddenly they do? Nurses in Ontario won a lawsuit a couple years ago and we're able to prove in court that masks do not work to stop viruses. Regardless of your stance on this I think it's important to look at both sides and apply occam's razor. In regards to an overarching  conspiracy I don't think it's some agenda that is involving all drs. What it comes down to is self preservation or an interest in one's own career advancement. Although many might disagree in private they are afraid of killing their careers and employability so they choose to say nothing. There is a very well funded side that is attempting to silence all opposition and who wants to be ostercized in the public sphere or be cancelled entirely due to politics.</p>

        <p>What’s your current speculation as to why? Do you think it’s about further enforcing the divide they’ve been nurturing for all these years, or maybe there’s lobbying being done for masks purely in the name of profit? A combination of both? </p>
<p>I dunno man I’m honestly not convinced, but I’m definitely open to being wrong. I just don’t see the point, and it doesn’t make any sense logically to me. The Duke University study is especially convincing to me when it comes to mask efficacy, along with the data we have from mask mandates and their correlation to the virus slowing down its spread. Every search engine I try the first few pages are all pro masks. Even Fox News is saying that masks are helpful. I just don’t understand why they would go to all that trouble to lie about something so ridiculous. I know I’ve been manipulated and lied to by each and every administration I’ve been alive for, but those lies make sense...and they don’t have peer reviewed studies backing them up. It’s just really fucking annoying that I feel like I have to question everything these days, especially when it comes to something as concrete as science.</p>
