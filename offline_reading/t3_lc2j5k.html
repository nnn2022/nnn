    <strong>Over 300 million Indians may have COVID-19</strong>

<p>That's a wooping 30x on the official registered cases, and almost 1/4 of the population. Also, it's 3x the number of total registered cases in the whole world.</p>
<p>It's not farfetched to assume that other poor and developing countries are in the same boat, and have massive hidden numbers. It will put the survival rate in a new perspective, however, it was already at "two 9s". Will it reach three, meaning 99.9%? What's more interesting is that they may be on their way to reaching "herd immunity".</p>
<p>That will not be the case in the West, though. We've spent so much time "social distancing" that the spread is presumably slower. It will reach everybody eventually, but will take much longer time. A few years to "flatten the curve"?</p></p>
