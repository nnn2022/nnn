    <strong>When will doomers learn that “if we just comply government will give us our freedom back”</strong>
    <p><p>I’m optimistic when the vaccine comes and we still have restrictions doomers and those who watch the TV programming device that government ain’t gonna give us back our freedom even when a “VaCcInE cOmEs” unless WE don’t comply to their rules 
Surprised they didn’t learn after “2 WeEkS tO slowdown the spread”</p>
<p>Good example is Victoria Australia we’ve eradicated this fucking thing, 0 cases for 40 days but still have some BS restrictions such as only 30 people on a house or business restrictions and office restrictions</p></p>

        <p>Good for you, but I've lost hope for the general public at this point. They'll probably just blame anti-maskers again, or give in because "that's just how things are nowadays"</p>

        <p>Everyone seems to forget we still have to take our shoes, belts, jackets etc. off and get x-rayed every time we fly because of something that happened almost 20 years ago despite nothing remotely similar happening since. Do not give the government an inch or they take 200 miles.</p>

        <p>Well honestly I don't mind that shit, flying is a rare event (for most people), it's quite a dangerous activity and it's really just passing through x-rays... But to meddle in my daily life like this, every-fucking-where? Fuck that!</p>

        <p>I live in the east valley in the greater Phoenix area. If you didn’t turn on news or the internet, you would not be aware that life was different except for masks. Every parking lot is packed including movie theaters &amp; traffic even tonight on a Saturday was like rush hour. There was a parade scheduled and I drove the route before it began and it was just crowds of people setting up and lining the road with lawn chairs and kids running around and playing. Tonight I witnessed my neighbor’s kids playing in their backyard with about 15 other maskless neighborhood kids. Life is already normal in so many places. It gets more normal every day. Bottom line is that this shit already isn’t lasting. It sure as hell isnt lasting after a vaccine anywhere outside cities. It’s already practically over outside many cities. Imagine the level of “fuck it” once the vulnerable then genpop start getting vaccinated or at least have the option?</p>

        <p>Dude, one thing I learned is to not underestimate the capability of well-off people to abuse their power. People in cities are so well-off these days that they don't have to get out of the house to do anything. These people are the fucking problem. They are connected to the internet and a big part of the fear generating machine.</p>
<p>And they will keep voting.</p>

        <p>&rt; sure as hell isnt lasting after a vaccine</p>
<p>I wouldn't get too cocky on that point. They could very well use adverse vaccine reactions as an excuse for further measures. Injecting huge number of humans with a novel vaccine all at once could very well lead to some absolutely hysterical reactive behavior if people start getting really sick, and the media remains as dishonest as it's being today. "The vaccine is not making people sick, it's a new mutant strain we are unprepared for". Be optimistic, but vigilant too.</p>

        <p>There is a certain percentage doomers that want it extended as long as possible. My FB post blows up with such people asking for government aid and stimulus. I'm sure some generally need it but others are just taking advantage. Wish they would do a study on that</p>

        <p>People are never going to automatically wake up at this point.There is never going to be a moment that definitively wakes up the doomers, we'll get that when the battle has clearly been won in our favor.</p>
<p>At this point, we have got to start individual outreach efforts and spread as much narrative-breaking information as possible. There is never going to be a switch that brings back business as usual unless the 1% gets everything they want.  Stop waiting around on headlines and start doing as much as you can yourself</p>
