    <strong>Question about the safety of masks</strong>
    <p><p>What evidence is there to support the idea that masks are harmful, or that vaccines are bad, or that the pandemic is fake? Feel free to try and enlighten me instead of silencing anyone who opposes you.</p>
<p>If this gets a lot of downvotes it will prove that you are delusional.</p>
<p>If I get banned or this post gets removed it will prove that you are, in fact, delusional.</p>
<p>Take your best shot.</p></p>

        <p>You do realize that by not following the mandates of wherever you‘re from you put other, maybe older people or people with pre-existing conditions at risk, Right? If you decide to act carelessly arund others you endanger random people that might have to be hospitalized just because you didn‘t want to make a sacrifice to the decadent luxury you live in. You endanger people who just want to live another day.</p>

        <p>No, that is not what is happening. I'm sorry that you have been lead to believe that, that you yourself might be murdering people if you make a mistake, or that other people you see are murderers. This is not the the case, and people need to return to the rationality and humanity that we had in previous years.  </p>

        <p>Please explain in your own words how not following any mandates besides washing hands often with soap and water and staying home if you are sick (normal guidelines pre-2020 but not mandates) will endanger other people? </p>
<p>I am asking seriously because nothing I’ve encountered yet explains that idea rationally.</p>

        <p>So i don‘t know what mandates you have where you live but in my country we wear masks in public places when maintaining a safe distance is not possible. We don‘t do it just because we‘re told to do so but out of respect for the ones that are endangered by the virus. Just because you feel healthy doesn‘t mean that you don‘t have the virus since it takes about 10 days before developing any symptoms. That means you don‘t that know you‘re infected until its too late. And thats why you should wear a mask. Not because you‘re told to but because your careless behaviour could infect countless others that might get seriously ill. It isn‘t about you. It‘s about the people around you.</p>

        <p>It doesn‘t matter if you see it as symbolizm or whatever but just wear a mask. Wether you like it or not we are living in a pandemic so you should at least try to protect others even if you don‘t understand or like the rules. These mandates are made by people with a lot more experience on the subject than you and I will ever have so wouldn‘t it be smarter to trust every doctor of our time over some random facebook sources or wherever you get your information from?</p>

        <p>No, whether its symbolism or not is the key to the whole problem. Like in times in the past they wore black bands around their arms to mourn the dead, and this time of year many wear poppies to show they remember those who died in war, but that shouldnt be forced, and hust because someone doesnt wear a poppy or black band doesn not mean they dont care. </p>
<p>The mandates are made by politicians who are not following the years of science that pertain to virus. They may indeed be attemping to use the science of psychology and of politics  in some way, but in my opinion it is the other branches of science that should have clear priority</p>

        <p>My Dad was almost screwed over by lawyers he hired. They were “professionals” or “experts” or whatever you call these deities you worship. Just because they have more knowledge on a subject than you doesn’t mean they are obligated to be good people. A mechanic could purposely fix your car just enough for it to work but not so much that you won’t need to come back. You love obedience, kind of like having a daddy or mommy tell you what do. Well, if you’re a rational thinking adult you can come to your own conclusions. So why would these doctors you view as saint lie to you? Well it’s as simple as monetary interests. Big Pharma has certain messages they want to propagate in order to get their customers to act a certain way. This massive medical monopoly has commited countless crimes against humanity, through medicine that causes birth defects labeled as “safe” by “holier than thou experts” to vaccines said to help people which have crippled children and caused outbreaks of the disease they were supposed to prevent (just look at the polio vaccine in Africa and India). </p>
<p>So think for yourself before you do what that person who was more knowledge than you in a specific field tells you to do. They don’t have any reason to care for you, the medical monopolies want you to be sick as it drives profit. Don’t be so naive, childlike to believe that authority figures would never lie to you.</p>

        <p>The doctors I know personally are against mandates, and I do not and have not used Facebook. What made you think I did? I never used social media for medical information, I use real doctors and scientific studies, which by the way, I have been reading for over 20 years. I did not 'wake up' in March of this year</p>

        <p>So, are you saying if you hadn’t been told to wear a mask, you would, on your own, suddenly decide wearing one shows respect for endangered people? </p>
<p>How do you know what other people find respectful? Did someone tell you? Or did you think of it yourself?? </p>
<p>For me and many people I’ve discussed this with, someone wearing a mask is <em>not</em> respectful. </p>
<p>In fact I personally find it psychologically disturbing. A friendly smile is much more respectful in my book, even if I’m endangered. Actually, <em>especially if I’m endangered</em>.</p>

        <p>The masks are rated to stop bacteria, most viruses are less then 100/1 of the size of bacteria.  I believe masks help... but are useless as in if you cover your mouth and nose with your shirt or elbow it does just as good.  And obviously when you sneeze or cough your shooting out like half a cubic foot of air at about 2-8 psi and with that much air masks just redirect 95% (estament) of the air while only about 5% actually gets filter through the mask.  (Hope that makes sense, it does to me but i have been told im bad at explaining things)</p>

        <p>Evidence it's fake: look how the classification of "underlying cause of death" changed after decades of citing the chronic health conditions that allowed people to be susceptible to respiratory distress in the first place.</p>
<p>"Multiple conditions and sequences of conditions resulting in death are common, particularly among the elderly. When there are two or more possible sequences resulting in death, or if two conditions seem to have added together (e.g., stabbing caused both right intrathoracic hemorrhage and air embolism), choose and report in Part I the sequence or condition thought to have had the greatest impact. Other conditions or conditions from the other sequence(s) should be reported in Part II. For example, in the case of a diabetic male with chronic ischemic heart disease who dies from pneumonia, the medical examiner or coroner must choose the sequence of conditions that had the greatest impact and report this sequence in Part I. One possible sequence that the certifier might report would be pneumonia due to diabetes mellitus in Part I with chronic ischemic heart disease reported in Part II. Another possibility would be pneumonia due to the chronic ischemic heart disease entered in Part I with diabetes mellitus reported in Part II. Or the certifier might consider the pneumonia to be due to the ischemic heart disease that was due to the diabetes mellitus and report this entire sequence in Part I. Because these three different possibilities would be coded very differently, it is very important for the certifying medical examiner or coroner to decide which sequence most accurately describes the conditions causing death."</p>
<p><a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/6636">https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/6636</a></p>
<p>"If COVID–19 played a role in the death, this condition should be specified on the death certificate. In many cases, it is likely that it will be the UCOD, as it can lead to various life-threatening conditions, such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In these cases, COVID–19 should be reported on the lowest line used in Part I with the other conditions to which it gave rise listed on the lines above it. . . . In some cases, survival from COVID–19 can be complicated by pre-existing chronic conditions, especially those that result in diminished lung capacity, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. These medical conditions do not cause COVID–19, but can increase the risk of contracting a respiratory infection and death, so these conditions should be reported in Part II and not in Part I. . . . The cause of pneumonia, such as COVID–19, needs to be stated on the lowest line use in Part I."</p>

        <p>One big red flag, is the warning on the boxes of surgical face masks that explicitly says the mask does not provide any protection against transmission of covid19 or other viruses.</p>
