        <p>hmm, a couple of questions after looking at your profile.]</p>
<p>Do you live in Ontario?</p>
<p>and are these comments you trolling?<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/kn61e7/walmart_shopper_screams_at_an_antimasker_across/ghj0wue/?context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/kn61e7/walmart_shopper_screams_at_an_antimasker_across/ghj0wue/?context=3</a></p>

<p>" here is no silencing to be done. If a mask can even help a tiny amount, then everyone who chooses not to wear one is putting our population at risk. "</p>
<p>" I don't think people should be shamed for liking a certain genre of music or television, but when it comes to our health this isn't something to have a wrong opinion about. "</p>
<p>" Let's get rid of these antiscience people who don't give a shit about others. They don't deserve your defense because they don't give a shit about you. "</p>
<p>I want to know these are your real opinions and your not just trolling and testing the waters their because of something about the way you worded those comments I don't feel like you really believe that scary how many upvotes you got though maybe those are your real opinions and if they say yes and I got a pm ready 4 ya...</p>

        <p>No, that's mostly my opinion. Now the opinions do generalize and I do believe there are cases where people that don't wear a mask do not fit into my generalization. </p>
<p>My beliefs are that even if a mask has a 1% chance at preventing the virus from being spread then it is a moral obligation to wear your mask.</p>
<p>Now if not wearing a mask could only affect that person then I would fully agree with the right to not wear one. That isn't the case, therefore it is selfish to choose not to. We could be walking around maskless and currently infected with no symptoms and my actions could cause the death of another person. I would not be able to live with myself if that happened, even if the chances are small. </p>
<p>I read somewhere on reddit that explains my feelings. Something like, "Even if it turns out that the masks/virus was a hoax, I can go to sleep soundly knowing that my intentions were to only help my fellow humans."</p>
<p>Now maybe you have some reasoning but all I see is the lack of empathy for others. The virus has killed people, we can agree on that I hope. I just do the little that is asked of me to hopefully prevent adding more to the death toll.</p>

        <p>There’s extremely high mask compliance in Ontario. I know because I live here. This video has nothing to do with masks, but everything to do with completely futile policies that did nothing to stop healthcare systems being overwhelmed but also completely decimated the livlehoods of hard working Canadians whilst major retailers and billionaires benefited tremendously. Unfortunately for you, more and more people are waking up to the reality of what’s happening policy wise. </p>

<p>Having empathy for other human beings is usually considered a good reason for doing something. Especially when it has little to no effect on yourself, how is it crazy that I find your views on this matter selfish?</p>

        <p>You came directly on this subreddit and claimed no one knows what they’re doing/talking about. Didn’t make a single comment on the actual content of the post, which is specifically about horrific policy making.  We know exactly what your way of thinking is. </p>
<p>I’ve been wearing a mask and “ following the official guidelines” for a province that’s been doing this since March last year. Guess what? It’s barely done a thing. And compassion also extends to letting people earn a meaningful living, cultivating a passion/craft, letting them see their own families after a year of this nonsense, not having their livlehoods wiped out and providing some semblance of evidence that what you’re doing has data to show its working.</p>

        <p>While I agree with you I think you and most of the people here in this sub are directing their anger towards the wrong people. We should have approached this issue head on with the full support of the government. Since they didn't provide the support that our population needed, it has resulted in the people feuding, instead of directing their energy towards the government who has the ability to provide that assistance.</p>
<p>You know why numbers are spiking? People visited their families during the holidays. It's fucking sad that we can't see them, it really is. I don't want to do this anymore than you do. But due to the government's response we have to take any measure we can to make it better. Yes data has shown that numbers are rising but is there any proof that it wouldn't have been higher without these limitations? I honestly don't know.</p>
<p>I'm here because I share the same sadness as others for people that aren't surviving this pandemic in other ways besides health. It's scary and I try to learn but yeah, I do sit here with a few beers after a day at work and get emotionally angry at the lack of empathy. I receive the same kind of responses whether I'm nice or rude.</p>
