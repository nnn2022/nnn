    <strong>Just to make you aware how vaccinations are handled in some parts of the U.K.</strong>
    <p><p>Some time ago I received a letter stating I'm appointed to get vaccinated on such and such date at such and such locations to receive a vaccine. Along with the letter I received a cheerful colourful booklet about the vaccination, with strong message of how it's beneficial to take it no matter what. The booklet states categorically that vaccination has no effect on fertility. Wrt pregnancy it mentions that if you're pregnant you should check with your doctor. It mentions two groups of people who might not be able to take the vaccine - if they're allergic to any ingredient (without listing the ingredients), or if they have some "very rare" blood disease. I "did my own research" and read manufacturers leaflets for all three vaccinations available for me and was shocked to see that the Big Pharma cared more about my health than my own government and NHS. As they gave me more information. As they stated clearly that it's not just currently pregnant women that should consult the doctor but also those trying or who could be pregnant (neither made a claim that it doesn't affect fertility). Listed specific ingredients i could check if I am allergic to. Described exact condition that I could have, that would prevent me from taking the vaccine, along with previous reactions to vaccines etc. </p>
<p>Now, it is my understanding that people who turn up for the appointment get to find out which vaccine is it and read that leaflet then. But if they don't understand some terms, they're not paying attention, they want to check with doctor first, they're not given that chance to fully understand it -it's either get jabbed or leave. A bit of a peer pressure and you just go with it. And if you only read that colourful booklet - you won't understand what is it that you're about to receive. That doesn't seem too healthy to me. My point is - our government is okay to schedule an appointment to get vaccinated, and they obtained my address because I'm registered with a GP. But the GP I'm registered with have never seen me. I just never seen my current doctor after I moved. I have specific issues mentioned in manufacturers leaflet that should make me at least consult with the doctor whether it's SAFE for me to get a jab. Whether it's not going to cause my DEATH. Issues that I noticed but I haven't brought up cause didn't consider it could be that dangerous.</p>
<p>The government booked the vaccine appointment anyway tho. I didn't. So if you're in the USA wondering why so many people in the U.K. get a jab - you should be aware that someone took care of it. We are nothing but a great market for those who want to sell the vaccines. And the system that I fund via taxes, is happy for me to die so that someone else gets rich.</p></p>

        <p>Exactly. The people that are paid to care about your health, don't actually give a fuck about your health. They only care about themselves.</p>
