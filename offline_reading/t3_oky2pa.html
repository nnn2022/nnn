        <p>Same.  My gf was complaining about it for a couple weeks it seems but I haven't heard anything since then.  But it's not like the anecdotal evidence of a dozen of your coworkers is a representative sample in the slightest sense.  </p>
<p>For me, I don't really know anyone seriously affected by corona either aside from my gf's uncle who apparently got it pretty bad and was in the hospital for 3 days.</p>
<p>I will say that pretty much everything I have heard is that people were kind of surprised by how much it rocked them and they didn't fully expect that as the people urging everyone to 'get the jab' doesn't want to be upfront about that part.</p>
