        <p>I don’t feel it is remotely the same. I know a few people who worked on this drug as a partner with Biogen on this. </p>
<p>There is tremendous unmet need on Alzheimer’s drugs. In trials this drug actually did help a percentage of patients. The label is indicated that if there are no changes to rhe MRIs then you come off the drug. There is a reason why there was a push because of that unmet need. </p>
<p>I don’t hate pharma. I know quite a few who work in pharma. My partner is a statistician in oncology forecasting. A couple of his drugs are for only certain types of patients. The massive pharma company and everyone working on the delivery of those drugs could memorize the users names because there are so few. But for many, who can tolerate the side effects, you can get precious more months with your loved ones. </p>
<p>I always said if COVID was like the disease in Contagion I would happily do whatever I could to be vaccinated. If I had Alzheimer’s I would take this drug if it meant I could have delayed progression. If I had terminal cancer I would do the same for several drugs. My partners mom has such severe Crohns that she has been in many clinical trials and is doing right now because it is the ONLY hope she has for improvement. </p>
<p>COVID doesn’t warrant an emergency use authorized vaccine to be injected into me. But I supported my mom getting it.</p>
