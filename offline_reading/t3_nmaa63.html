    <strong>What is it all for?</strong>
    <p><p>I been watching some covid stuff lately - I suppose the main thing being this claim by many highly qualified doctors and scientists that the vaccine is very very dangerous. Luc Montagnier has said it will kill everybody inside 2 years who has had the jab. I don't really remember ever before anything similar. I mean that a terrible disaster has now been authoritatively predicted. In the years before 12212012 there was a good deal of space brother type enthusiasm for a big change on this date due to it being the end of a baktun of the Mayan calendar - but this was a money spinner for science fiction fans to buy into. We were suppose to all get neurally webbed into a global superconsciousness - but it was a no show. But this all was not at all a global media event and marketing campaign that has produced a product that some are now saying is going to kill everybody who has bought it. I have heard over and over - the claimed science of it to do with the immune system - but never a debate between scientists on both sides of the ideology. The question remains - why have they maketed this injection to the whole of humanity? What is it for? If not to wipe us out - then what?</p></p>

        <p>Personally I don't think it's going to kill everyone who got it, I just think that it's an experimental technology that was rushed to market and that scientists are not clairvoyant Gods Among Men who never make mistakes. Not hard to imagine that in 5-10-15 years, people who got jabbed start having higher rates of autoimmune disorders or vascular problems or other weird illnesses than the "control" group. Just simple but potentially devastating unintended consequences.</p>

        <p>It's enough to be concerned that a vaccine currently in phase 3 trial is being pushed on everyone. Even if it turns out to have no long-term effects, we still do not know that.  </p>
<p>Shouldn't a control group be encouraged as well?</p>

        <p>I'm of the opinion that's uts just a way to usher in global socialism. Imagine if 30% (number pulled out of thin air) of everyone that has taken the jab has massive medical problems in the next 2 years....what a great excuse to massively expand the welfare state and bring more people under the thumb of government.</p>

        <p>If the vaccine is not there to wipe us all out, it is there simply to be the "solution" to the "problem". Why the quotes? Because the problem is one manufactured and embellished by the establishment, and the solution only has to be the illusion of solving the problem. Even if only ~15% of the population actually believes something (e.g. coof is the Black Death, the vaccines are safe and effective) you can convince the other 85% of people that the 15% view is actually majority opinion. This will make people go along witht the groupthink, especially if dissenting opinion is stifled and people are under house arrest.<br>
Part of this was I think was also to ruin D. Trumps chances of re-election. I don't think it was a coincidence that all of a sudden vaccines were announced a week after the election was... fortified.</p>
