    <strong>UK: I HAVE STOPPED WEARING A MASK AND YOU SHOULD TOO</strong>
    <p><p>This post is for my fellow brothers and sisters living in the now tyrannical UK.
I've stopped wearing a mask. Simply stopped.
I started by buying a mask exemption lanyard off of ebay for £2-3 and began by wearing that.</p>
<p>The first time I wore it and shopped I felt... Strange. Like I was doing something wrong. I realised that I was taking charge of my life though, even though I was lying about a disability.</p>
<p>Then, slowly over the next week I stopped wearing the lanyard. I just walked into places.
Nobody said a THING.
I also made sure to have the lanyard in my bag or pocket incase, but I immediately felt so much better that I wasn't lying about something to stop wearing a mask- but that I was taking a stand and simply stopped.</p>
<p>I traveled from the north, through london, down to the south by train and didn't wear one once. Now, I just walk into shops without wearing one and I've began to see other people do it to.</p>
<p>I'm making this post to tell people from the UK to start resisting this mask cult. (Side note, I played minigolf with people who wore masks. We know each other but they were so obedient that even though they were outside, because they were doing something, they felt the pressure to mask up).</p>
<p>If any one plans to stop me from entering a shop I will say this:</p>
<p>"Excuse me can you wear a mask."
"I'd love to but I'm medically exempt"
"What's your medical exemption?"
"... Are you my doctor?"</p>
<p>Or I'll simply say I have CS disease (common sense disease) and anxiety (recognised in the UK as a mask exemption). </p>
<p>The best feeling is walking maskless into somewhere and seeing someone else without a mask inside, they look at you with that "look" and you know you're in this together.</p>
<p>Rise up.</p></p>

        <p>I know, but his main goal is to survive society’s collapse, and he especially wants me to survive with him. His point is the Jewish people that survived the holocaust were not the first Jewish people to stand up to hitler. He says we should be smart about which battles we pick, and since we can take a mask off, but can’t take a vaccine out of our body that’s the best battle to pick and I do agree with him. But as I see everyone around me only masking up where the government tells them to and immediately taking it off outside, I can’t help but think if I just stop wearing one I could inspire others as well.</p>

        <p>This is kind of my internal dialogue as well. As much as I want to be vocal and be seen being normal and help give others the courage to do so, I've so far decided to pick my battles and the mask (as much as I want to tear it off) is the least of my worries compared to the vaccine. So I'm still deciding my approach, whether I want to fly under the radar or not. I've always been good at blending in while staying true to my internal values and this will be a helpful skill in the future. But I also feel bad not speaking out. Dunno</p>

        <p>You’re not lying about a disability per se. One of the mask exemptions in the UK is if wearing one would cause you severe distress.</p>
<p>Technically licking the boots of wannabe fascists distresses me, so I am exempt.</p>
<p>I don’t use the lanyard. Most of the time nobody asks about a mask, and when they do, “I’m exempt” ends the encounter.</p>

        <p>It’s like when you have a broken arm. You start to notice many other people wearing casts. When you stop wearing a mask, you realise there’s a lot of people in the same boat. Not a majority, but it’s growing.</p>

        <p>I think that that's awesome and I think it would be beneficial for many. Should be careful I have read that in some places (might have been in the states) the bylaw officers can actually request proof of disability and fine you if your unable to show some proof.</p>

        <p>Went into a shop the other day for the first time in a while and I blanked everything - waiting for someone to leave, one way systems, masks, and had a lanyard in my bag just in case. No one said anything. I think really so many of these rules aren't enforced here. I've not been doing any of it in school for months either.</p>

        <p>I've worn a mask a total of 2 times since this whole shit show began. Both times to get into my work office building. Get stopped regularly on my way into the big name supermarkets in London but only maybe 2 of those times the security guy actually put hands on me and physically stopped me from entering. Worst case scenario I can pull up my t shirt / scarf around my face to get in the door. Where do you live OP out of curiosity?</p>
