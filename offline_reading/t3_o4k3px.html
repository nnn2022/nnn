    <strong>Some legal ease to ease you to sleep.. or maybe help. Cheers NNN</strong>
    <p><p>Dear Sirs,  </p>
<p>Request for formal investigation  </p>
<p>I wish to draw your attention to conduct  and omissions by the Government (and individual ministers within the  Government) that I consider to be crimes against humanity.   </p>
<p>I formally request that you undertake  a comprehensive and diligent investigation into all matters detailed  below, ensuring appropriate action is pursued.  </p>
<p>I believe that the Government has  engaged in the termination of British lives and committed numerous  crimes against the British public - the public that they are duty bound to serve.  </p>
<p>I understand a crime against humanity to  be a deliberate act, typically committed as part of a widespread and/or  systematic attack directed at a civilian population with knowledge of  the attack that causes human suffering or death on a large scale.  </p>
<p>The Government, since the introduction  of The Coronavirus Act 2020, has taken intentional and reckless  decisions and actions that have led to the Government being guilty of  domestic and national terrorism and of removing each individual’s  unalienable rights, as detailed below:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Government has denied early life saving treatment for COVID-19; denied life- saving treatment for non COVID-19 medical issues; failed to advise the public of proven non-medical treatment options;   </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government mandated “do not  resuscitate orders” for the elderly and the disabled. These were put in  place without the knowledge and consent of the individual or next of  kin;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government mandated social  distancing and mask wearing despite evidence that such measures are at  best ineffective and at worst, harmful; has denied contact with family  and friends; access to general medical treatment; access to work and  school; and access to leisure;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government forced the closure of “non-essential”  businesses resulting in millions of citizens having to rely on  Government furlough schemes to survive and introduced stimulus packages  which, combined, have led to enormous national debt. Those business  closures have led to the suicide of 33 individuals (to date) from one  group alone;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government’s “stay at home”  orders have imprisoned citizens in their own homes and the closing of  the borders has removed the right of citizens to freely travel;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government policy has denied those in  care homes access to visitors; prevented citizens from seeing family  and loved ones in hospital and many citizens have consequently died  alone; denied citizens the right to attend funerals; and denied children  the right to visit grandparents;  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government has intentionally deprived citizens of their fundamental human rights contrary to international law; and  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Government has:   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Embarked  upon state terrorism in the form of a relentless fear and propaganda  campaign spearheaded by the Behavioural Insights Team and implemented by  the BBC and other MSM – it has been admitted that these psychological  measures were covert, without the knowledge or consent of the British  people and now recognised in many cases to have caused irreversible  harm;   </p>
<p>Introduced disproportionate and draconian policies in response to COVID-19 that have eroded civil liberties and human rights of the citizens;   </p>
<p>Rolled-out an experimental vaccine with no consideration of immediate, medium and long-term  adverse effects. Most people are not aware that the vaccines have Black  Triangle status, which “cannot be removed until safety is well-established”  (as per the Government guidelines), nor that the vaccines are in trial  until 2023 therefore the Government has not received an individual’s  informed consent to vaccinate. Regulating bodies such as MHRA are not  independent, as claimed, having received substantial financial donations  from The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (on record);   </p>
<p>Repeatedly  lied to citizens about the lifting of lock down measures, PCR testing,  asymptomatic spread, case numbers, death numbers, vaccinations and the  introduction of vaccine passports (specific Ministers are on record  denying passports would be implemented when in fact contracts had  already been awarded); and   </p>
<p>Unlawfully extended The Coronavirus Act 2020 (the WHO downgraded COVID-19  from being classified as a ‘pandemic’ on 19 March 2020, as confirmed on  the Government website – yet the rhetoric and pressure to vaccinate and  comply continued under the false claim of the presence of a pandemic in  the UK requiring  emergency measures, this was officially not the  case).  </p>
<p>UK citizens have been harmed or have  lost their lives as a result of the wilful misconduct of the Government.  The acts listed above amount to crimes against humanity and as such  breach internationally established standards detailed in, inter alia;  </p>
<p>The Nuremberg Charter;  </p>
<p>The Geneva Convention; and    </p>
<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   </p>
<p>Government power has not been restrained  by Parliament and at times the Government has acted beyond its legal  power and authority. For example, The Coronavirus Act 2020 was put into  effect in the absence of proper and correct Parliamentary scrutiny.    </p>
<p>I believe such acts by the Government, as stated above, to be ultra vires.   </p>
<p>The Government’s actions and polices  show no sign of abatement. In fact, the Government is recklessly  pursuing its agenda of vaccinating children and introducing vaccine  passports regardless. This is neither acceptable nor tolerable in light  of the above and formal action is required as a matter of urgency.  </p>
<p>It is my position that the Government is guilty of nonfeasance, misfeasance and malfeasance in a public office.   </p>
<p>I therefore conclude this letter with my formal request that you carry out a full investigation without delay.   </p>
<p>It is imperative that those responsible  for the aforementioned crimes against the British people are held to  account and swiftly subjected to the forces of due justice.  </p>
<p>I look forward to your confirmation that  my claim in respect of the actions taken by the Government, has been  placed on record and that a formal investigation will be instigated  immediately.    </p>
<p>Yours faithfully....</p></p>

        <p>While I like where you're going with this, I would advise providing sources under each bullet point. I'm not trying to be difficult, but here's why. </p>
<p>If this is sent anywhere, it will be sent back with you provided no source, this is opinion and speculation. Then you're in a position that you now have to defend or drop. While you might say, ok, sure. This is wasting your own time, when you could just provide the sources in the beginning. </p>
<p>So, something that could be sent, read, whatever in a matter of hours or days, now does the back and forth for weeks or months.</p>

        <p>Yes that’s something I hope to do it’s just a lot of work and, well I’m a noob at all of this really. </p>
<p>I want to be 100% accurate and concise so could take a while.</p>

        <p>I think it's quaint you still think governments and their laws exist to provide justice or care what we think. It seems most people, including you, just don't get it. Good luck with your endeavor!</p>

        <p>Think this is a great piece of writing. Might be good to allude to the corruption involved in awarding Covid contracts (<a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/uk-government-faces-lawsuit-over-procurement-of-covid-immunity-test/4012797.article">example, lateral flow tests</a>) and the <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4716">conflicts of interest </a> of SAGE members. </p>
<p>I really think that there’s an argument to be made that the way many of these contracts have been awarded is tantamount to embezzlement of public funds and money laundering.</p>
