    <strong>It will never end in Europe</strong>
    <p><p>Nobody can convince me otherwise. Despite almost every country saying they'd never lock down again after March/April, here we are. At least half the major countries have gone back under for nothing other than shits and giggles. Most places have more ICU beds free than they did this time last year, there's barely anyone dying compared to March, and there isn't even that many cases. There is ZERO reason for these lockdowns and restrictions. Some countries even have lower overall deaths this year than they've had in years.</p>
<p>We know for a fact these lockdowns and restrictions are only prolonging the inevitable, so what's to stop them from doing this again in March? They clearly don't care about money as they seem to think the European union's money printer doesn't come with rising inflation. What's going to happen is we're going to end up in an endless cycle. We lockdown, we slowly open up with restrictions, then we lockdown again, then again we slowly open with restrictions and on and on and on. We're NEVER going back to normal. And there really will never be a normal. Even if all the governments decide to give up this newfound power, we have destroyed the economy and everyone's mental health. We've turned people against each other, we have neighbours snitching on each other, people in stores harassing people for not covering their faces, pretty much everyone hates tourists with a passion and sees them as trying to ruin the "hard work" people are putting in (as if everyone isn't in the same position).</p>
<p>Any stupid little troll that thinks this is Europe just caring about its citizens lives, take a look at all the shit that's been made law under the distraction of COVID. From "emergency" powers allowing police to detain you if they suspect you have COVID (multiple countries), to sealing records of the government assisting in literal child trafficking and then immediately banning protests (Ireland), to making gay marriage and abortion all but illegal (Poland), to deleting emails between the government and the actual health experts because it wasn't "politically desired" (Denmark), to basically declaring itself a "temporary" dictatorship (Hungary). Go suck a fat one if you think European governments are virtuous little angels who would never take advantage of a crisis to gain more power.</p></p>

        <p>I agree with you completely, and I think this was never about covid but about gaining more power over us. Things are going to shit at such a rapid pace that by middle of 2021 we are gonna be standing shoulder to shoulder with North Korea, and we would be the only ones to blame because we allowed it to happen.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Other than in the few places they were welding people into their homes, China had more freedom than most of Europe at the height of the "pandemic". How did we become so entitled we think we can literally avoid ever being sick?</p>

        <p>Good news: Corona will probably be completely over in June.</p>
<p>Bad news: What will come will be much much worse than what we have now.</p>
<p>Google "great reset". You are right, it was never about public health (which government cares about the health of their people?)<br>
Always been about money and power, as usual.</p>

        <p>There's a vocal minority who are loving it, but most people are just silently obeying and then complaining quietly to their friends and family. The protests don't attract enough people to make a difference, and they won't because they're presented as far-right groups every single time and people start hating them. The only significant one is Italy's right now.</p>

        <p>In Poland that abortion law was announced about a week ago, since last Thursday there are big protests every day everywhere in the country. The government is using the classic ,,blame it on the youth" tactic and tries to make people think that young, ,,irresponsible" people attending the protests are responsible for ,,rapidly growing" official numbers.
