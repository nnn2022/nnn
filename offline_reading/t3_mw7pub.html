    <strong>Funny conversation with my husband ðŸ¤£</strong>
    <p><p>Me to my husband: did you know that there's a new rule where you have to wear a mask on your work zoom calls now? Because you are risking spreading a computer virus, you know like if you aren't wearing a mask you might give someone a virus but because it's through the computer it's called a computer virus.
Husband: oh is that only for video calls or also for audio?
Me: just for video
Husband: ok good, because if you had said audio as well, I would've though it was fake.</p></p>
