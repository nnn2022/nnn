    <strong>Metaphysical Evil</strong>
    <p><p>I have been watching this unfold since day one, nearly. I was one of those early /r/Coronavirus people who was seeing the stuff coming out of China—people being welded into their homes, randos falling over dead in the middle of the street—and I knew that something big was going on. </p>
<p>As my parents are both elderly, with the kinds of pre-existing conditions that would put them in peril, I was the guy who, back in February, when news of the Washington nursing home deaths started happening, asked them to please refrain from going to buffets until we knew what was going on. Not because I thought we were under attack from a pandemic, but because <em>it was possible</em>, and, doing some quick cost-benefit analysis, it seemed like foregoing buffets was a decent risk, if the downside was dying.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, though, I "knew" one thing: Either COVID-19 was real, or it was a PSYOP, and both were dangerous. But I prayed, literally prayed, that it was the former. Pandemics are scary but are ultimately natural phenomena. No sense in screaming at the clouds, so to speak. But if it were a PSYOP, then it seemed to me that we were in for some real trouble.</p>
<p>All these months later, it's now obvious to anyone with a brain that it is, without any doubt whatsoever, exactly and only a PSYOP.</p>
<p>In trying to piece together why it is they're continuing to shove this story down our throats, with every tool at their disposal, for so long, and to such an extent, I am left with one question: why?</p>
<p>A lot of people will say that it's to usher in The Great Reset. For those with a CoNsPiRaCy background, maybe it's the often-touted "Ordo Ab Chao" of the Freemasons. Maybe it's a global equity grab. Maybe it's because the market is already running on Blackrock's AI servers, and this is how they're going to usher in Universal Basic Income while doing away with all of the jobs that their AI is inevitably going to replace.</p>
<p>Problem is, none of these sit right with me. They don't have the explanatory power I require. They all bring up more questions than they solve.</p>
<p>So I am now, quite surprisingly to myself, reaching out for larger, more comprehensive answers, and I've arrived at the following: <strong>we are dealing with metaphysical evil on a planetary scale.</strong> All of the worst, most greedy, most sadistic, most terroristic, elements of society are, right this very moment, doing everything in their power to crush the human spirit once and for all. All of their control measures seem to be exactly and only in the service of one goal: <strong>dehumanization</strong>. And I can think of no good reason to attempt such a thing on such a scale outside of metaphysical evil. The kind of evil that exists purely for evil's sake. The kind that crushes simply because it can. The kind that used to rape children to sate its thirsts that has become dulled by years of rape and needs a new, larger, more comprehensive target: all of humanity, afraid and alone, shut into small micro-bubbles of race/gender/creed, all against all, forever. A perfect prison without any hope of escape. </p>
<p>In short: for as bad as it seems, I believe it might actually be <em>much, much, much worse</em>. </p>
<p>I am not of the mind that Jesus is coming to fix it. I am not convinced of a coming Golden Age, after it's finished. I think we might just be stuck in a torture chamber, and I have no real idea what to do with that.</p></p>

        <p>I keep thinking about that old quote: "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."</p>
<p>What happens when "the system" is setting up the conditions whereby it is IMPOSSIBLE for good men to do ANYTHING?</p>

        <p>I find it hard to understand how almost all countries decided that unemployment and massive business failures were ok when we have never locked down this long before. There have been small quarantines for more serious illnesses, like cholera and typhoid. They barely lasted 2 weeks. If a disease was very bad, they separated the sick, like leper colonies. The healthy went on with life. </p>
<p>The inability to meet with others is unique. Even in times of plagues, people helped others at risk to themselves.</p>

        <p>I’m assuming you believe in some sort of “energy works” as in thoughts are energy and the law of attraction etc. Once the fear was ramping up, I was VERY worried of what that would entail going forward. Fear is considered a low-level energy. What will happen when the entire world is whipped up into a frenzy of fear and relentlessly bombarded with more fear propaganda? I think we’re stuck in a very bad place collectively.</p>
<p>I agree as well about evil. However, I do think that there could be ulterior motives as well for what’s happening, such as the benefits that the global banking industry, pharmaceutical industry, Bill Gates, etc. will reap. Your point about the main goal being to finally crush the human spirit is spot on. I haven’t really seen many people touch upon these points, so thank you. I’m sure we could talk at length about this, but I’m also sure we’d just be running in circles if we did lol</p>
<p>Thank you for posting this.</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading it and replying. It's a really ugly time, but I feel weirdly lucky to have the opportunity to reach out to folks who are willing to confront reality in all of its ugliness. Little small miracles inside the maelstrom, y'know?</p>

        <p>I agree with you, my hunch from the very first week was that the intent was to break the human spirit and dehumanize us. After almost 6 months everything that has transpired just solidifies my initial suspicion. The amount of deaths is dwarfed by the degradation of the collective consciousness that has occured. I pray we as a species will be able to recover. This whole thing has shown that a lot of people are incredibly naive and easily manipulated and there are a lot of evil people who want nothing less than to control everyone to the upmost degree. What a recipe for disaster.</p>
