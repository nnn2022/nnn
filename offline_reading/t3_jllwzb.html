    <strong>Household spread of Covid-19 is common and quick, CDC study finds</strong>
    <p><p>If anyone says you're a bad person for visiting friends send them this.<br>
If they themselves are with their partner etc they just as "bad" for spreading the virus.</p>
<p>If we have to win this fight against the lockdowners we have to hit them were its most critical.</p>
<p>Any doomer that says we are bad people for visiting friends or going to the bar are EXTREME HYPOCRAITES if they themselves share home or visit their spouses.</p>

        <p>we've known that it spreads like wildfire at home since pretty much February when we realized that China was welding entire families into their apartments to keep the virus isolated to that household. it's not rocket science. </p>
<p>why is it spreading in nursing homes? prisons? multi-family housing? multi-generational housing? it's the close, intimate, *extended* contact + something to do with the viral load, i suspect. and central air/heat aren't going to make things any better going into the (Northern hemisphere) winter when people can't and won't and really shouldn't open their windows for a long time.</p>
<p>honest to god, sometimes i think we should have just outfitted (or replaced) every single HVAC unit in this stupid fucking country with a UV light/HEPA filter, sparing no expense, in March when it became obvious that old, poorly-maintained ventilation was a issue. much cheaper than crashing the economy and killing human society as we know it.</p>
<p>but what do i know? i'm just a girl! someone should ask an Expertâ„¢!</p>

        <p>Exactly, Politicians think lockdowns and vaccine is the only solution. But there are so many other methods that remains unexplored sadly.</p>

        <p>That's why we need to separate families and put children in institutional quarantine centers.  It's for their own good and yours too.</p>
