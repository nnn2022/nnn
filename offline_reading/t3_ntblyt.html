    <p><p><strong>I know you guys already knew this, but I am happy to confirm, you were right again guys!</strong> <br>
Heres conrete proof in the form all the fanatics have been demanding.  This is an international team of experts stating explicitly what we all thought.  That this is big pharma money paying off academia and They go on to describe over 20 possible long term heal complications, including  <strong>SEVERE PNEUMONIA FROM CROSS REACTIVITY.</strong>  ....<strong>Its JUICY.</strong>  </p>
<p>The second paper, written by a prominent epidimiologist at a respected resarch institute, clearly demonstrated that the efficacy of the vaccines have been <strong>VASTLY over stated.</strong>  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750020304248?via%3Dihub#!">Long term effects</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/57/3/199/htm">Outcome Reporting Bias.</a><br>
So i guess the experts actually say that the vaccine, actually does carry a some serious potential long term risks and was rushed out purely on the basis of fudged efficacy trials. </p>
<p>I've but together a  little quote pack for your convinience, out there in the wild, but I would highly recommend full reading these two peer reviewed studies in respected medical journals.  </p>
<p>After that, I would be honored if you fine ladies and gentlement would join me in ramming this down the throats of some of the nazi pricks who want us locked in camps? <br>
<strong>Awesome.</strong>    </p>
<h1>Long term effects</h1>
<p>&rt; Hence, the massive viral vs. human peptide commonalities described since 2000 [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750020304248?via%3Dihub#bib0735">147</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750020304248?via%3Dihub#bib0740">148</a>]  clearly explain how the protective anti-viral antibody immune response  can become a pathogenic autoimmune attack against the human organism,  thereby addressing the issue of why SARS-CoV-2 attacks the respiratory  system so heavily [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750020304248?via%3Dihub#bib0745">149</a>].  <strong>T</strong><strong>he scientific cross-reactivity context and the clinical data showing  that immunization with SARS-CoV antigens causes severe pneumonia</strong> [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750020304248?via%3Dihub#bib0750">150</a>] suggest a prominent pathogenic role of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies in COVID-19. <br>
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750020304248?via%3Dihub#bib0750">The article reference.</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; The present study examined many viral mechanisms that could lead to  vaccines exacerbating rather than attenuating viral infection, based on  findings from [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750020304248?via%3Dihub#bib0810">162</a>].  Generically, the main problem is that prior viral exposure  (vaccine-induced or wild/natural) could impact future viral exposure  (vaccine-induced or wild/natural) positively or negatively. Years could  be required to determine which outcome would result, both in the  short-term and in the long-term. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;<br>
<strong>In summary, it is difficult to see how safe COVID-19 vaccines can be  developed and fully tested for safety on development time scales of one  or two years, as proposed presently.</strong> The only real protection against a  future COVID-19 pandemic or any other viral pandemic/outbreak is the one  that was demonstrated to work in the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19  pandemics/outbreaks, and in the annual influenza pandemics/outbreaks<strong>: a  healthy immune system capable of neutralizing incoming viruses as nature  intended.</strong>   </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;To ensure vaccine safety, long-term human testing under real-life  conditions (exposures to multiple toxic stimuli) is required. There is  an incompatibility between the accelerated vaccine development times  being pursued by government and industry and the long times required for  validation of vaccine safety. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<h1>Outcomereporting bias</h1>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Unreported absolute risk reduction measures of 0.7% and 1.1% for the  Pfzier/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, are very much lower  than the reported relative risk reduction measures. Reporting absolute  risk reduction measures is essential to prevent outcome reporting bias  in evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy.  </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Curiously, “why these vaccines seem so effective  while previous attempts against other pathogens haven’t appeared as  promising remains an open question” [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/57/3/199/htm#B1-medicina-57-00199">1</a>].As noted in BMJ Opinion, 26 November 2020 [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/57/3/199/htm#B9-medicina-57-00199">9</a>],<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“There  may be much more complexity to the ‘95% effective’ announcement than  meets the eye—or perhaps not. Only full transparency and rigorous  scrutiny of the data will allow for informed decision making. The data  must be made public.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;As was also noted in the BMJ Opinion,  Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna reported the relative risk reduction of  their vaccines, but the manufacturers did not report a corresponding  absolute risk reduction, which “appears to be less than 1%” </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; Currently, differences between relative effect  measures and absolute effect measures in studies are “poorly understood  by health professionals, and even more poorly understood by patients.” [<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/57/3/199/htm#B29-medicina-57-00199">29</a>] In addition,<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“…critical  appraisal knowledge and skills are limited among physicians,” and “use  of relative effect measures was associated with greater perceptions of  medication effectiveness and intent to prescribe, compared with the use  of absolute effect measures.”</p>
<p>&rt;5. Conclusions<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;A critical appraisal of phase III clinical trial data for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine BNT162b2 and Moderna vaccine mRNA-1273 shows that absolute risk reduction measures are very much lower than the reported relative risk reduction measures.  Yet, the manufacturers failed to report absolute risk reduction  measures in publicly released documents. As well, the U.S FDA Advisory  Committee (VRBPAC) did not follow FDA published guidelines for  communicating risks and benefits to the public, and the committee failed  to report absolute risk reduction measures in authorizing the BNT162b2  and mRNA-1273 vaccines for emergency use. Such examples of outcome  reporting bias mislead and distort the public’s interpretation of  COVID-19 mRNA vaccine efficacy and violate the ethical and legal  obligations of informed consent.</p></p>
