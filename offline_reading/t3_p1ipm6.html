        <p>A year ago they had refrigeration trucks brought in for all the bodies they assured us would soon be piling up. I don’t think the trucks were ever used. Just like the covid overflow centers in California. They quietly shut them down. So are we supposed to fall for this again???</p>

        <p>I said I wasn't going to post here anymore, but I can't just not respond to someone making BS false claims like you are.</p>
<p>The refrigeration trucks were absolutely used and there's still several hundred bodies in them that have yet to be buried. Why are you actively lying? It's a simple Google search to find out that you're wrong.</p>

        <p>Get over yourself. You sound like a narcissist. This post isn’t about New York it’s about Texas so you can fuck right off and stop accusing people of lying. Texas also had refrigeration trucks brought it and they didn’t use them.</p>

<p>Fort Worth started using the refrigeration trucks starting on December 26th. Sources: </p>

        <p>&rt;Harris Health System in Houston is reporting 1 in 4 patients at its two hospitals have tested positive for Covid-19.</p>
<p>Right there in plain sight, they are testing all patients. It doesn't matter what people come into the hospital for, you test positive, you're now a COVID-19 hospitalization. Then the media will apply whatever percentage of the delta variant the health department reports to the number hospitalized.</p>
<p>This is done in a way where it isn't exactly incorrect but more in a way to get the viewer to drawn the "right" conclusion. They will present the number of hospitalizations and then shortly after that say the health department has reported 80% of infections are delta or whatever the variant flavor is this month. Well obviously you can just multiple the cases by that 80% to get the number of delta cases.</p>
<p>Nope, we have no idea how the samples for genomic testing are being collected to determine the variant of the virus the sample found. Maybe they oversample one county that is having an outbreak of one variant but it hasn't quite made it to the other counties of the state. It would be incorrect to say 80% of the cases in the state are all the one variant.</p>
<p>&rt;Another lagging problem is personnel shortages. Porsa said he would welcome federal aid to relieve some of the pressure. The hospitals are 254 nurses short leaving hospitals with no options but to hire agency nurses at high prices, he said.</p>
<p>Another gem, I wonder how many nurses they will fire or have fired?</p>
<p>&rt;Ava Amira Rivera tested positive for Covid-19, according to Amanda Callaway, a spokeswoman for Harris Health System. Callaway said Ava was having seizures and needed to be incubated but Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital, where she was first taken, does not offer pediatric services. None of the major pediatric hospitals in the area had beds available, Callaway said.</p>
<p>And why did none of the major pediatric hospitals not have beds available? Was it COVID-19 or RSV? See what I mean, they give you just enough information to reach their desired conclusion...</p>
