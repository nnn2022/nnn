<p>It always has been the same as the flu, that kills people every year. Older people and those with other diseases die <em>with</em> the flu; it isn't the main reason.</p>
<p>With the flu we never had lockdowns, restrictions, etc.</p>

        <p>But it's literally not though flu though. Completely different virus with completely different symptoms. I've had the flu probably like 5 or so times in my life; within a week you're fine, back to perfect health. I've had covid once and it's much worse, this was back in summer and my smell and lungs still aren't the same. The actual experience of the virus was much worse too. No where near the same thing tbh.</p>

        <p>I had worse effects with the flu than I had with the virus</p>
<p>2 years I got the flu and I couldnt do anything. I couldnt even leave the bed or hold my phone. I basically slept for 3 days with a fever, headache, sore throat, coughing until I regained enough strength to get out of bed and take a shower to reset my system. Those flu symptoms lasted 5 days altogether. Every time I got the flu, it knocked me out completely.</p>
<p>With corona, I walked 2 miles to the testing centre and back. I managed to write an email to my manager telling her I couldnt come in and also managed to take a shower every single day and take ibuprofen and eat proper meals. My corona symptoms lasted 3 days in total.</p>
<p>Corona was nothing compared to my flu</p>

        <p>I work in fast food, many of my co-workers disappear for multiple weeks, sometimes months.  COVID doesn’t last three days normally.  </p>
<p>The symptoms aren’t consistent in their ferocity, but that doesn’t mean we should let people with pre-existing conditions/the elderly and even some perfectly healthy people kick the bucket because “it wasn’t bad for me, so everyone will be fine!”  Consider yourself lucky you don’t live in a place where COVID is so rampant you have no choice but to take it seriously, because you see people’s health deteriore with your own eyes until they quarantine, likely hospitalizing a couple family members and infecting a few more people in the process.</p>

        <p>No. You should. The vast majority of people recover from it just like the flu or cold. The externalties of locking down are not worth the low death rate. </p>
<p>I live in London, in one of the boroughs declaring it as an emergency so it is rampant but guess what? People are realising that lockdowns are bullshit. They dont lockdown every year for the flu. There is no reason to for the corona virus</p>

        <p>I don’t think complete lockdown and quarantine is needed either but it takes very little to preserve other peoples health.  The death rate is low, yeah, but why fuck around and get people sick.  I live in Rhode Island, it’s bad here, and every building with a COVID case is a breeding ground because people don’t take it seriously.</p>

        <p>Typical flu symptoms - cough, fever, chills, aches. It can leave you feeling pretty low for weeks after depending on the person</p>
<p>Typical covid symptoms - same except the cough is an annoying tickly cough rather than a chesty one, and the loss of smell and taste.</p>
<p>So depending on the person either could be worse. Some people who have had flu really bad had a really mild case of covid, or the other way round. It also might have something to do with more general immunity to flu since everyone has been exposed to it for a long time.</p>

        <p>We just don't know. Where has flu gone this year? Ah yes, p/i is now counted as PIC, adding to the covid stats and explaining the random disappearance of a virus we have never been able to get rid of. With the crazy way everything has been handled this year, everything is in a bit of a spin, but consider that both covid and flu target the already vulnerable (flu also targets kids) and how covid deaths are counted (any death within 28 days of a positive test) the information is probably not entirely accurate. Covid probably is a bit worse than flu, largely due to a lack of previous exposure in the population.</p>

        <p>Flu hasn't gone anywhere; numbers have just decreased because lockdowns, masks and social distancing work for most diseases. Flu deaths don't add to covid because people with flu don't test positive for covid because it's a different disease. </p>
<p>&rt; how covid deaths are counted (any death within 28 days of a positive test) the information is probably not entirely accurate. </p>
<p>This is a huge misunderstanding. Its not how assigning cause of death ever worked or works now. If you have diabetes or something, then get covid and die, it'll go down as covid because covid was the stressor that ended your life. The same is true for the flu. The whole narrative of every death going down as covid is a lie. </p>
<p>&rt;Covid probably is a bit worse than flu, largely due to a lack of previous exposure in the population.</p>
<p>You say this like it means covid isn't bad. This is terrifying. If we put covid deaths and flu deaths in the same category for simplicity, then this is essentially like the flu all of a sudden getting 3x stronger.</p>

        <p>This is what I don't get. The restrictions are stopping flu completely, yet covid which spreads in exactly the same way still has rising cases? That makes absolutely no sense, if our measures were able to eradicate flu then they would have put a massive dent in covid at least. Like, a noticeably large difference. However, there are studies on how lockdowns aren't effective - how are so many of these possible if the restrictions can eradicate flu? And it's not because covid is more contagious, because it's seriously not that more contagious that two diseases that spread the same way has one eradicated and the other still going strong.</p>
<p>If you die of a heart attack, but you had covid two weeks previously, you still died of a heart attack. People may have died with covid, and yes it may have aggravated an existing condition, but it doesn't make it the primary cause of death. It could be a cause of death, but further investigation from "you had covid three weeks ago and you died so it has to be covid" even if it was obviously something else. Someone has been fighting cancer for years and come down with covid two weeks before they die - did they not die of cancer??? And all of this wouldn't happen to be why deaths of leading causes such as heart disease as I mentioned, have gone down by what covid has gone up? Also, hospitals are paid to report covid patients, but of course that couldn't possibl have an effect here.</p>
<p>And no, covid isn't that bad. Low death rate, rare long term effects, mild to moderate cases in the general population, targets those who are already vulnerable... The scary death count on the radio is not entirely accurate. Where are all of the excess deaths in the year of this deadly pandemic?? Believe what you want.</p>

        <p>Nobody saw that coming, nobody.... I knew that once they're done scaring people with covid they will change the narrative. It's a shame that 1 year ago comparing covid with the flu was enough to be considered an idiot and a dangerous person.</p>

        <p>&rt;that 1 year ago comparing covid with the flu was enough to be considered an idiot and a dangerous person.</p>
<p>Actually no. In January And February every media, politician and expert said corona was like a flu. Not to be taken serious and that closing borders is racist and that the west would handle the situation way better with our "superior system".</p>
<p>Then when things got worse they silenced the experts and the media flipped positions.</p>

        <p>One of Bidens first actions as president is to reopen businesses and schools putting to rest any doubt that this entire thing was made up so biden can be seen as the savior of America. They're playing political games with our lives, people have lost everything and we just need to be thankful when they give us the crumbs from the loaf of bread they took from us.</p>

        <p>They are just laying the groundwork for the upcoming gaslighting campaign. Once Biden/Harris are in office it will be all good news all the time. By May or June they will be calling it a Flu and stories about how they never advocated for lockdowns will be all over the place. The pandemic will be "solved" by Biden and by Dec next year it will be "what pandemic?"</p>

        <p>Yup. This coming summer will be normal, but you still have maskers and maybe a few little restrictions. By holiday, like you said,  they will all be laughing about how we had to wear masks and everything. Its gonna be disgusting.</p>
<p>Also don't forget the great shift of people who advocated for lockdowns to do an about face and say they always thought it'd be a terrible idea.</p>

        <p>It's more like,they'll start testing AGAIN for influenza. Which we don't anymore. Tests are under the key. The only tests we are allowed to use are the covid19 ones. (I have taken a shot of the document at work) The 8inches Qtip as the quick ones aren't being distributed yet for some obscure reasons.</p>
<p>That's why the flu "dissapeared" in a year and once they'll switch to flu instead of covid they'll tell you "see how masks,lockdown,curfew and not seing anyone is working ! Flu dissapeared".</p>
