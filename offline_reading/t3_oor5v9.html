    <strong>With every lockdown you delay someone's cancer treatment. With every disposable mask you contribute to the destruction of our oceans and nature.

    <p><p>Where will you draw the line? How far is too far? How many small businesses need to go bankrupt before you realize this isn't about a virus? How many people need to commit suicide before you fucking come to the obvious conclusion that lockdowns are extremely detrimental to everyone's mental health and serve zero fucking purpose and benefit NO ONE? How long before someone you know dies from the clot-shot? Some people barely survived their first two shots, I can't imagine they're looking forward to the booster shots.</p>
<p>This insane double-think needs to fucking stop. You can't say a vaccine is safe and effective when plenty of people are having terrible side effects to it or are outright dying mere days after having it. You can't preach patience for over a year only to turn around and demand everyone rush out and get an experimental shot they have serious concerns about. This is a fucking psy-op and nothing more at this point; an excuse for governments, the media and Big Pharma to get fat and rich off our languished misery.</p>
<p>You will all start (metaphorically) eating each other before long as increasingly ludicrous and intrusive measures and restrictions are brought in to curb a virus that poses very little threat to the majority of the population. Those who were at risk have either had the fucking Fauci ouchie now and should therefore be more than protected, or are so immunocomprised that they CAN'T get it, in which case any attempt to bring in draconian shit like vaccine passports will exclude them from society too. That is pure discrimination and totally unfair.</p>
<p>Do you really fucking want to "live" like this forever?</p></p>

<p>I still don't understand why the vaccine is considered so mandatory by so many people and businesses when it's not even FDA approved yet. I'm not an anti-vaxxer, but surely anyone with common sense should understand how bad it is to inject an <strong>experimental</strong> drug into their systems.</p>

        <p>that’s honestly what boggles my mind. how can people blindly follow the sheep and don’t even know where the final destination is? i’m not anti vax either. i get my flu shots.. i’m anti inserting my body with a drug that has had barely any long term testing. it’s crazy how people will risk their health and mind and body because the government said this is the way to live! it’s bullshit and quite terrifying if you ask me. it’s not just america, it’s the entire world that’s so heavily pushing this vaccine. when hell breaks loose, where do we go? when the whole world is brainwashed mindless controlled zombies and the government has a grip so tight it’s impossible for the 5% that’s actually awake, to fight back. but what do i know? i’m just a “conspiracist” l’d rather be that and question everything then a mindless fucktard.</p>

        <p>There are quite a few people who actually like this new arrangement. I've encountered several here (and elsewhere) who have stated in no uncertain terms that they like being able to just stay at home all the time without it being frowned upon. And they like wearing masks to hide their faces, with some of them openly admitting it's because they're ashamed of how they look. I've also seen feminists say that they like masks because it eliminates the "you should smile more" comments that they claim to always be getting (citation needed, lel).  </p>
<p>They accuse us of being "afraid of needles" and what not, but they're openly admitting to being afraid of life itself.</p>

        <p>Try wearing a mask 8 hours a day in Texas weather because I work outside in retail. We haven't been wearing masks for the past couple months because the "you got the vaccine? No mask for you" narrative being pushed. After a while no one was wearing masks vaccinated/unvaccinated. Now my work is requiring proof of vaccination, and those who can't provide it must keep mask on at all times. If you are seen without one, then get sent home. I'll gladly take a piece of cloth over my face than an experimental shot. And the kicker? Those employees vaccinated STILL have to wear masks, starting next week. And idk what we're going to do about customers. We're entering Stage 4 again, but good luck trying to persuade people to put their mask back on because they all thought they were "in the clear". I'm totally apathetic towards it all, and feeling slightly helpless watching the madness play out.</p>

        <p>My word of the year last year was "threshold". What is the point on a grey scale where it is no longer white and is black? There has to be a definite line, you cannot zoom in ad infinitum. Even if it is 50.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%, it is still more than the other.</p>
<p>It was mostly with the election shenanigans. "Well, there's <em>always</em> <strong>some</strong> election fraud therefore we shouldn't look into it because it's <em>always been there</em>." Well, at what point do you care? (Probably when they lose).</p>
<p>"Well, we've <em>always</em> had <strong>some</strong> restrictions on our freedom. We shouldn't fight back because those restrictions have <em>always been there</em>". </p>
<p>There has to be a point too far where people break. Unfortunately, people nowadays will accept alot before realizing they are too far gone.</p>

        <p>Honestly, here is the scariest part of it all for me...</p>
<p>They don't know what they are doing.<br>
They literally <strong><em>DO NOT KNOW</em></strong> what they are doing.</p>
<p>They are increasing their probability of death and lessening their lifespan by perpetuating COVID. They see it no other way. It's literally the perpetuation of COVID that is the problem. </p>
<p>They think that they are helping to keep everyone safe, but they are causing harm with these selfless thoughts, and thus they become selfish thoughts. Some people out there do mean well for others, but they are doing exactly what they are trying not to do by perpetuating COVID. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of endless lockdowns when they want the lockdowns to end.</p>
<p>It's an systematic loop that won't be broken easily.</p>

        <p>So, the surgery thing. How exactly are you supposed to run an efficient surgical suite when covid is rife? </p>
<p>Firstly all staff have to wear stricter levels of PPE, and isolate patients so they don't mix with others after. Not impossible to deal with, but does slow things down/reduces number of cases down per day. Even with extra protections, still possible to catch covid intra-op if someone makes a mistake.</p>
<p>Then post op, patient needs to not come into contact with other patients unless they've all tested negative. Now patients are supposed to isolate for 2 weeks prior to surgery, although many don't and I completely understand why, but this again increases the risk of catching covid in hospital.</p>
<p>Then what if a patient requires a hdu bed or ITU bed. Many covid patients have filled these spots, or may fill them during that patients stay. So either their recovery is hindered by covid, and they're recovering on two fronts, or the extra care you need is already taken up by someone else extremely sick.</p>
<p>Ain't that simple to sort out</p>
