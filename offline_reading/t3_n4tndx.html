        <p>I was one of the first calling for lockdowns and travel restrictions early on, while the scientist advising our governments were telling us it's just the flu and not to worry about it. </p>
<p>The CFR is waaaaaaay less than what we thought initially. The measures being taken are disproportionate, unfounded in science and cause more harm than good. Please see <a href="https://gbdeclaration.org">gbdeclaration.org</a> </p>
<p>The masks don't work. I still wear one not to cause a fuss, but it's security theatre (which is exactly what our science and pandemic plans said (pre covid) </p>
<p>the lockdowns don't work.....otherwise they would have worked. </p>
<p>The vaccines are experimental and rushed. There are many adverse events associated with them and there is no telling what the long term impacts will be. </p>
<p>The virus is largely not dangerous to the under 50 population. If you are over 50 and want the vax, go ahead its a personal choice. </p>
<p>The youth should not be vaccinated, it's irresponsible and there is zero need for it at all.</p>

        <p>I own and operate a funeral home.  At the onset of all this shit i was genuinely nervous.  I feared for my elderly father that worked along side me. I was nervous about bringing it home.tommy family.  But that changed, drastically.  In 2020 my firm handled 116 'covid-cases'.  Only one was under 60 years old, and that person was nearly 400 lbs.  Every person was either old, fat or both.  Every single one.  I've personally seen how the numbers are drastically inflated.  People in hospice, dying of multi-organ system failure from old age or terminal disease. Covid was the cause of death.  Not the cancer or kidney failure that had destroyed their body.  I had a man hit by a car.....covid was one of the causes of death on his certificate.  Men that had no covid symptoms, clothing their chest and dropping dead in front of their families of heart attacks...covid.  Homicide victims.....covid.  in states like mine(blue) any person that had a positive covid test are treated are labeled covid deaths.  Even if they had no symptoms and the test was administered after they died.  Yes hospitals and coroner's offices are swabbing the noses of dead people.  I've been into every hospital in this major metropolitan area.  The news told me the were overflowing.  I see empty hallways and employees with no masks on, in areas that are not open to the public.  It's very typical to walk into an office with dozens of employees working and see people pull up their masks when someone from the "outside" enters.  Our medical examiner's (coroner) set up an overflow center.  I've been there numerous times.  One of the investigators showed me a spreadsheet of all the bodies they currently had.  Nearly every name had a orange dot next to the case number.  He then explained that every single orange dot signified low levels of vitamin d.  So not only is it taking the old, obese and terminal...of those people it's taking the ones low in vitamin d.  All the while the media and governor is saying stay inside.  </p>
<p>I think the way I think because I've seen the reality.  Covid is not fake.  It is deadly serious.  But only for a limited amount of the population.  Don't even get my started on the torture the medical community has been put through by this.  Every hospital is covered in signs that say "heroes work here", as a distraction.  Hospital staff is being gas-lit, they are told they are heroes so they don't ask why a terminal patient can't have a family member at bedside.  Patients, their families and hospital staff are being subjected to psychological torture to continue this bullshit narrative.</p>

        <p>Different Input, different conclusion.</p>
<p>I mean, I can list many reasons but its the combination, Ill give you one example:</p>
<p>Back in 2011 there was this swine-flu as you might remember. The WHO called it a pandemic, virologists were claiming millions will die and pushed the panic. In the end, the swine-flu killed like 50.000 worldwide, the panic was uncalled for.</p>
<p>Back then we had two popular doctors in germany. One being the Virologist Dr. Drosten, claiming millions of deaths will happen, the other being the Epidimiologist Dr. Wodarg calling the panic BS. Dr. Wodarg turned out to be right. He initiated a EU-commision looking into it, as he claimed that pharma, WHO and others had knowingly pushed the pandemic narrative for profit, but couldnt prove that to be true.</p>
<p>This man (Wodarg) has quite the resumee, studied medicin, was practicing it for decades, then became a politician sitting in the german parliament, he was also on the supervisory board of Transparancy International.</p>
<p>So, when 2021 hit, history repeated itself. On the one hand, Dr. Drosten "Millions will die", on the other Dr. Wodarg "Its basically the flu".</p>
<p>The difference was, back then Dr. Wodarg and Dr. Drosten had regular media appearances, both promoting their reasons for their believes. Both believes being viable.</p>
<p>This time however, Dr. Wodarg was labeled a crazy conspiracy theorist for claiming that unnecesary panic being created. And he got beaten down by basically ever major german media outlet, without even once being interviewed or anything.</p>
<p>I mean this guy was right the last time. This time he should have more credibility. While the guy was wrong the last (few) times. He shouldve less credibility this time.</p>
<p>It was virtually insane to see this all play out with the back knowledge of what happend the last time.</p>
<p>Now I might be a crazy person. But at that point I literally dont care about any facts on Corona or anything, if I see someone beaten down for no good reason I will always side with them.</p>
