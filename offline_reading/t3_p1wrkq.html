    <strong>Military Mandate For “Vaccine” That Was Developed Using China’s Code... When China And The U.S. Are Not On Good Terms... What Could Possibly Go Wrong?</strong>
    <p><p>So the relationship between the U.S. and China is rocky. We are not on good terms with each other.</p>
<p>And the secretary of defense wants to prepare and make our military as robust as it possibly can so that we are a formidable opponent against China, should they try anything with us.</p>
<p>Then why are we now making it mandatory for all of our troops to take a shot that was developed in 2 days using a genetic sequence that China gave us?</p>
<p>Here is the source on that:</p>
<p>https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/03/how-moderna-made-its-mrna-covid-vaccine-so-quickly-noubar-afeyan.html</p>
<p>&rt;    It is true that Moderna’s mRNA vaccine was ready remarkably fast, as was Pfizer’s.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>Chinese scientists put the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus online on Jan. 11. Over the next two days, the NIH and Moderna used it to plot out a vaccine.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Afeyan remembers getting a key call about the development of the Covid-19 vaccine. “January 21st, my daughter’s birthday.... I got a call from Davos [during The World Economic Forum] from the CEO of Moderna,” he says. Bancel had been approached by a number of public health groups at the conference “urging” him to work on a vaccine.</p>
<p>&rt;“We literally decided overnight...to try and do this,” Afeyan said at MIT.</p>
<p>&rt;Moderna delivered the first doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to the NIH for testing on Feb. 24, 2020, and “the first Moderna shot went into a volunteer’s arm in Seattle on March 16, 2020,” according to Afeyan.</p>
<p>&rt;After testing the Moderna vaccine on 30,000 volunteers, on Dec. 18, 2020, the FDA authorized it for emergency public use, and three days after that, the first Moderna vaccines were administered to front-line health workers, according to Afeyan.</p></p>
