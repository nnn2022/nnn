    <strong>Damage to the social contract</strong>
    <p><p>NOTE: I ORIGINALLY POSTED THIS ON LOCKDOWNSCEPTICISM, ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW IT BECAUSE IT MENTIONED MASKS, AND THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW POSTS ABOUT MASKS. WHICH SHOWS HOW USELESS THEIR SUPPOSED SCEPTICISM IS.</p>
<p>SO I'M POSTING IT HERE INSTEAD.</p>
<p>HERE WE GO....</p>
<p>One of the worst things these lockdowns, mandates, and rules enforced by media fearmongering have achieved is to cripple the social contract that keeps societies functioning.</p>
<p>Humans are evolved to live in smallish groups, a village worth of people, where they know (and thus can trust) everyone. Today, most of us live in very different social circumstances. This works because of an almost paradoxical pairing of assumptions -- that of freedom and that of shared values and rules. You and I let each other go about our business without interference, suspicion or micromanagement, while also being secure in the knowledge that we are both following certain courtesies and moral perspectives.</p>
<p>The situation we have now destroys this balance. The call to visual conformity to rules -- stand here, don't gather in the wrong numbers, wear your face cloth -- means that you have a choice. Failure to comply either deliberately or through accidental violation can result in random people confronting and harassing you because they've been convinced that you are a danger (and a selfish arsehole). Either you conform consciously and knowingly to micromanagement (which I consider in the best case scenario to be a mistake that will cause more harm than it prevents, and worse case to be a deliberate, cynical attempt to encourage totalitarian mindset under the guise of public health) or you risk both frightening and offending people and opening yourself up to attack. Confrontation that upsets or harms both them and you (for different reasons).</p>
<p>When I meet with anyone now, whether strangers or acquaintances -- anyone I don't know intimately -- I'm nervous. If I'm not wearing a mask right, will they think me a threat? Will they be scared of me, offended, think me a selfish granny-murdering arse? Or if I am wearing it right, will they be scared of me for similar reasons? Will they think I'm judging and pressuring *them* to conform?</p>
<p>How can any sort of trust and mutual comfort result from this?</p>
<p>When I was younger, I had panic attacks at the notion of being out in public, out socializing. Over the years I improved to the point that for the last five or six years I've been happily travelling and interacting as "normal", without any problems. A triumph of my mental health. And now I'm right back to where I was, only worse -- because I know that this time it isn't irrational fears I need to confront for the sake of my health, it's an entirely rational, truthful analysis of the situation.</p>
<p>The social contract is dead to me. There is no society, and I don't want to be interacting with it. Both our freedom and our shared trust in one another's morals and courtesies is destroyed.</p>
<p>Whether the mandates, etc., are a mistake, an incompetence, or something more deliberate and sinister is besides the point: the damage is very real.</p></p>

        <p>I completely agree with everything you've said here. I think the hardest thing for me is trying to live a lie and to play along with the charade. I generally try to speak the truth and have a low tolerance for bullshit, yet everytime I go out and interact with people, or even online, I have to pretend that masks don't cause more harm than good, that there really is a big scary virus out to get me, and that our civilization is not being dismantled and reformed into a homogeneous global open-air prison.</p>
<p>It's exhausting.</p>

        <p>I don't pretend anymore. I mention it maybe one time in passing in conversation to whomever and then move on. It's too exhausting to go along with it. I think that is also why I'm not getting any flack from store employees anymore. Most everyone complies and the employees spirit is too broken to confront me since the "novelty" of being a virtuous team player has worn off and I'm only one dude. </p>
<p>I also think if more people started not complying this would be over pretty quick and the domino effect would commence, like 6-8% would kickstart it...unfortunately not enough of the public are at their breaking point at this time, the "what do I have to lose" epiphany....</p>

        <p>Then don't pretend.</p>
<p>I make no bones about my opinion, and refuse to live a lie, or to wear a face diaper "to make others feel better". Their "feelz" aren't my problem.</p>
<p>If some stranger chooses to treat me like I'm radioactive because I refuse to go along with this whole charade, to hell with them. If friends or family do this, then they never really cared about me anyway, and to hell with them, too.</p>

        <p>Firstly, I just want to lightly defend LockdownSkepticism's choice to avoid posts about masks. It was a deliberate choice on their part, and it is keeping the sub from risking being banned. I think that's important. They are a large sub, providing an important meeting place for like minded people during this time. If they were banned for allowing mask related posts it would be a setback for all of us. Just my opinion.</p>
<p>But I agree with you. It has been fascinating watching the change in my neighborhood over the past six months, going from just a few people wearing masks outdoors, to now %95 - %99.</p>
<p>I refuse to wear the mask when walking down the street outdoors. I do this for multiple, consciously chosen reasons, and I am prepared to explain those reasons to anyone who asks. So for no one has. The only negative reaction I get is people rolling their eyes, or making a big show of stepping all the way to the other side of the sidewalk.</p>
<p>To me this reaction is fascinating, and it betrays some of the underlying truth of the situation. Because every time someone rolls their eyes at me I think, "If the premise here is that I am putting your health at grave risk by passing by you without a mask on, shouldn't you be screaming at me, or calling the police? Isn't rolling your eyes a pretty big under reaction to a grave health threat? No. Obviously, you know just as well as I do that people don't spread respiratory illnesses by passing by each other on the street. Especially when they have no symptoms of said illness."</p>
<p>Yes, the social contract has been damaged. Hopefully we make it out the other side without slipping all the way off the edge.</p>

        <p>Yes, you may have missed it but there was a big wave of bans all across reddit a month or so back. Anti-mask subs were banned. Radical feminist subs were banned (in that case for "promoting hate speech" against trans people). Various subs related to the podcast Chapo Traphouse were banned. And possibly some others, but I think those were kind of the big three "categories" of subs getting banned.</p>
<p>It's a grey area to me, because on the one hand I believe that reddit is a private company who can ban anyone they want, any time they want, as long as doing so is within the bounds of the terms of service. On the other hand, they hold a massive influence over the public discourse at the moment (along with twitter) and their ability to shape the narrative is ripe for abuse / misuse.</p>
<p>I don't personally, fully know what I believe to the right way to handle that situation.</p>

        <p>Even so, I still think it's a good idea to have a sub that is specifically dedicated to the issue of lockdowns, as a discrete subject, and that leaves the other aspects of the situation to other subs. I think that's best, and I have felt that way since they implemented the policy. Again, just my opinion.</p>
