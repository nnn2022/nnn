        <p>How strict is the policing in your home state? I'm from the Philippines and we have community watchdogs, otherwise called 'barangay captains' in almost every corner ready to detain anti-maskers. It's more strict in private establishments such as malls where you need to wear a plastic guillotine on top of your mask and do the QR code bs. I'm not exaggerating. The good side from us is social distancing tends be excused because overcrowding here has always been the norm..... which is actually stupid because being all sweaty and dense will it easier for you to catch the virus than supposedly covering your air passages.</p>

        <p>I moved to Cyprus a while ago from UK. PCR test every 3 days (either 10€ or stand in queue for 1 hour) or vaccine pass, not allowed leaving home after 23:00 (was 21:00), restaurants are open only on verandas. Before last week we had to send sms (only 1 per day allowed) to go outside for 3 hours and most of the places like cafes, shops, hairdressers and etc were closed, even you could not go to the beach (allowed only for individual sport training). Breaking restrictions measures costed 300€ per each instance. We had high % of infected, but only like 0.01% of those died and they were aged 85+. We also have voter passport, obliged to pay social insurance, another type of governmental insurance, tax, vat and other crap to feed the government that does absolutely nothing to help people with their businesses.</p>
<p>Yeah and mask of course (or vaccine pass). No mask - 300€. You can’t even take off mask in the car with passengers that are not your family members that live with you.</p>

        <p>Your policy enforcement there sounds more tough. Our current curfew is 22:00 though it used to be 18:00. We have minimal indoor dining. Beaches, hotels, and even parks are still barred. Fines are rarely imposed because it's an assumption violators tend to live below the poverty line so they take them to the gym and make them kneel for a few hours as punishment. The wealthier residents gave the optiom to bribe. Ofc, I'vd come across some Western tankies who believe there's nothing wrong with it because it's better to practice old brutal traditions than succumbing to the imperialism and capitalusm of fines, wtf.</p>
