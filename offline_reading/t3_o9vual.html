    <strong>I have a couple friends who are proper Branch Covidians. Know what sucks? If they knew I posted here they'd probably turn on me instantly.</strong>
    <p><p>I've put up with their shit for a year and a half. I've indulged their hypchondria and paranoia as best I can whilst challenging them on some of their more delusional beliefs and being upfront about my hate for masks, lockdowns and the new normal. I've tried convincing them that this is overblown. I've had to be careful about it though because, as you all know, people are really fucking tetchy when it comes to this shit, ESPECIALLY the "vaccines".</p>
<p>Everything is so SUPER FUCKING SERIOUS (<em>folds arms, pouts lip</em>) when it comes to Covid. <em>Unless</em> you're poking fun at the "conspiracy theorists" by posting a shitty joke on Facebook about "5G signals" after you've had the Fauci ouchie, then you can be as blase and cavalier as much as you like; too bad for the poor fuckers who died from blood clots, eh?</p>
<p>I've given them the freedom and autonomy to do what they want (mask up, stay inside, become a test subject for an experimental "vaccine") yet they refuse to extend me the same courtesy. They don't give a single fuck about my mental health, evidently. It's getting to the point where it's really hard not to harbour feelings of resentment or betrayel; I extend the same negative feelings towards celebrities and the like who have kept their mouths fucking shut throughout this fiasco or actively endorsed it. I'll never look at Kevin Smith or Dave Grohl the same way again, that's for sure.</p>
<p>They want me to risk my health by taking a rushed, experimental "vaccine" yet they refused to leave the house without a mask on for over a year because of a meme virus they had a infinitesimally small chance of dying from. Ha, go fuck yourselves. I won't do to my body what you've done to my mind over the past year and a half through your cowardice, gaslighting and bootlicking. When I started this post I was going to say I wouldn't end our friendships, and that's the difference between us, but you know what?</p>
<p>FUCK THAT.</p>
<p>If they support vaccine passports, mandatory jabs and the segregation of people like me then fuck them to the Moon and back! If the next few months go ahead as we predict they will then I can see my friend circle growing much, much smaller. This is their last fucking chance to wake up. I'm still hoping things won't go that way, that there isn't some nefarious plot to get us all vaccinated so we can be controlled through vaccine passports or just outright culled; but we'll have to wait and see. One thing's for sure, I will never, ever look at these people the same way again. Not after the way they've looked at me.</p></p>

        <p>Ugh, join the fucking club. Worst part is in addition to being Branch Covidians, they're cultists for Her Imperial Wokeness too who can't wait for Pedo Joe to slither down to hell (for different reasons than me, of course). Their bootlicking may very well come to pose a literal physical danger to me.</p>

<p>Buy some small and powerful magnets on Amazon.  See if they stick to your friends shoulders.  If they stick, it will wake them up. And if they don't they'll think you've lost it.</p>
<p>Doesn't sound like you have much to lose with them at this point.</p>
<p>I did the magnet test on my mother yesterday.  I thought it was stupid disinformation to make vaccine skeptics look bad, but several of my Twitter "friends" swore that magnets stuck on people.  So I tried it and it stuck.  Only on my mom and not on my unvaccinated wife or myself.</p>

        <p>All I can think of in the human body that would cause that would be that the vaccine is somehow pulling iron to the injection site - and I don't know how that'd be possible. I've seen a couple of 'sticky' people too, and am flummoxed.</p>
<p>If these folks are symptomatic after vax, maybe they should be checked for anaemia, amongst other things. That's not listed as a risk factor for covid, but betcha by golly in the real world - it is.</p>

        <p>My mom had some sort of clotting issues (she had "COVID toes" after the vaccine) but claims to feel great now.  </p>
<p>I'm still torn on if I'm glad she got it or not.  She was buying into the propaganda hard and I hadn't hugged her for nearly 9 months when she got the shots around Christmas.  So I'm glad that something had made her feel safe to go out again.  Even if it's a placebo, I'm still happy about it.  Unless it is a substance that harms her, which we still don't know.</p>
