        <p>The selection highlighted is a limitation on the value of the report.  </p>
<p>What it does not change is that no deaths resulted in the vaccinated patients under study.  Go ahead and read the rest of the  main report.  Not just the footnote that was quoted here.   The fact remains over 99% of deaths now occur with unvaccinated patients.  </p>
<p>That fact was not changed by this report.  I faii to understand the apparent resistance to living and to doing everything we can to battle this horrible disease.  I have never seen people more actively in denial - to the point of hiding life-saving choices to others.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell has taken the vaccine.  Is he going to be branded in some negative way because, ultimately he chooses to live?</p>
<p>Why do that?  Was small pox vaccine harmful?  German measles?  Why not let every other virus have a go at us?  Why this one?</p>

<li>I am not from the US, so don't politicise this as that has no currency with me.</li>
<li>Who is "hiding life-saving choices to others" when people who have an internet connection are free to be fully informed and find a vaxx station any time they want?</li>
<li>I have survived 18+ months without getting sick despite not following a single C19 protocol and I have a 1/10,000 chance of dying WITHOUT any medical intervention in my age group. For reference, I am more likely to die whilst cycling to and from work or being bitten by a shark in the ocean in which I swim each week, than having a negative outcome from C19. I shall never get vaxxed.</li>
<li>I had read the report but it doesn't stop the headline of the thread from being funny.</li>
<li>100% of the population was never vaxxed to stop smallpox and I suggest that you look at a historical chart showing 250 years of measles incidence in the UK before suggesting that vaxxes were responsible for the majority of the decline in measles cases. Oh, and while you're at it, find out how it's transmitted and the IFR of the disease without any treatment. (Spoiler: you'll see that driving your child to school is far more dangerous than measles.)</li>
<li>I can't stop laughing at your inability to see that a vaxx that was designed over a few hours on a weekend, that has no medium- and long-term safety data is not comparable to vaxxes that have been used for decades.</li>
<li>Thank you for participating in the Phase 3 human trials. Thank-you for respecting my decision to participate in the trials as a member of the control group.</li>

<li>It was never and never should have been political.  I have no idea why it would be.  It's medicine fighting a virus.</li>
<li>When someone selectively quotes the one phrase out a report to discourage others from using medicine and hides the positive outcomes they have achieved that - they hid life saving choices from others.</li>
<li>I am glad you allegedly won't die </li>
<li>The word funny is used here when the headline disparaged others from saving their life.</li>
<li>I can not verify the claim that UK never took any vaccine for german measles or polio, or other etc.   </li>
<li>I can not verify that the vaccine was  'built over a weekend.' In fact if one reads the report and not the (claimed to be funny) headline it might disprove that.</li>
<li>I would respect someone for their decision for themselves. It is however unfortunate that by catching the virus, it continues to infect others.</li>

<li>I am not from the US and I remember a certain political party saying that they would never take a "Trump vaccine" because "it was not safe and rushed." It was ALWAYS political.</li>
<li>Don't be asinine - the OP left the link for anyone with a modicum of intellectual curiosity to click. No-one is hiding anything from anyone.</li>
<li>Thanks! I won't.</li>
<li>You need to learn the art of emotional continence - no-one was disparaged. </li>
<li>Don't speak about vaccines for diseases whose transmission you do not understand, and whose reduction in the population you cannot verify. Do you want me to give you links?</li>
<li>Do you want proof? How can you inject something into your body that you don't even know how long it took to develop? Golly, you are so cavalier with your life!</li>
<li>Even your idols of science are screaming at you to wear a mask because the vaxxed can contract and transmit the infection. These so-called vaxxes were always advertised as being leaky vaccines so the idea that you can achieve "ZERO C19" with a leaky vaxx is illogical. It's never going to happen and you're delusional to think otherwise.</li>

        <p>1) Can't verify.<br>
https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/graham-told-trump-speak-covid-vaccines-79293737</p>
<p>2) I'm not being asinine.  I'm simply saying that a clear message about how well vaccine works was hidden.</p>
<p>Points 4 through 7 are not about vaccine efficacy.  They change the subject to some one named "you" and do make disparaging or limiting remarks</p>
<p>a) who doesn't understand?
b) who can't verify - job of the CDC.
c) who needs a link to the CDC?
e) who needs proof of what?
f) people who want to live take a tested vaccine which prevents disease at this point 99.% of the time.  No need to bring up someone named  "you" for already the 6th and 7th time
g) who is cavilier?  I would say if someone has a chance to save themselves and instead warps the message to try to hide  what works that might seem cavalier - but with other peoples bodies - not just only their own.
h) So here is the total contradiction where it first claims "OP left the link for anyone with modicum of intelligence and then what does point 7 do?  It berates those who were intelligent enough to write the report.  </p>
<p>So point 7 and point 2 are in contradiction. 2 says - any smart person can read the report and point 7 calls the people who wrote it 'idiots."</p>
<p>That particular problem actually characterizes the entire anti-vaxx "movement.'  First they said the virus was a "hoax" Then delta hit... and the vaccine still prevents death 99% of the time - but people in many states where they rejected the vaccine</p>
<p>Personal attack - choosing instead of the subject matter to focus on someone named "you."</p>

        <p>Medicine does not become political 'just because' we live in the United States, not UK.  But this kind of sloppiness is causing danger to people I know and places I love in Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, Arkansas and other states where the decision to not take life-saving medicine was done for any reason at all: a lark, politics, hate - I have zero idea why someone would not protect themselves.</p>
