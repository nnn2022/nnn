    <strong>Vaccination squad at my school</strong>
    <p><p>On 21. July a vaccination squad will come to our school and give the shit to everyone who wants it. The parents need to sign a shit ton of paperwork, and still no one questions it. Covid isn't even dangerous for young people without preexisting conditions. And those who have conditions already are vaccinated. So what's the point other than money for big pharma?</p></p>

        <p>It's a very interesting zeitgeist we're in. The global population is divided into an Us v Them paradigm. The Vaccinated v Unvaccinated. 'The cleansed' v 'the dirty'. Believers v heathens. The ruling class and their subjects, v the free-thinkers. Those who want to stay in the garden of eden, v those who think heaven and hell are manipulation tactics leveraging a fear of the unknown. Those who cave-in to ultimatums, v those who see beyond the dualistic narrative.</p>
<p>Plato's (or socrates') fable about the cave, where reality is presented as shadows on the wall, is much like this. The shadow impressions are made by contrasting light and dark, in order to present a story. Only outside of the cave do people see that reality is a lot more colours than darker-and-lighter contrast.</p>
<p>It is a little ironic that the dualistic ultimatum idea isn't just applied to get people scared enough to comply, (get vaccinated or else...), but applied to contrast people who either believe in the ultimatum, and people who don't believe the ultimatum is an adequate representation of reality</p>
<p>But whatever. Interesting times at least. Nice test for humanity. We'll definitely be judged by future generations who'll have the gift of hindsight</p>

<p>Over a century and we still haven't stamped out communism (or rather, fascism masquerading as communism. Which what always happens when you try to enact communism.). It's shameful. Not only have we not moved on, we've allowed it to infect every aspect of our civilization.</p>

        <p>No, there is something else much darker and more evil than money, or even control. I don’t know what it is, but many people feel it and recognize it, across countries and continents. They already control us de facto, they have proven it extensively in 2020 before we even started talking about vaccines.</p>

        <p>What country are you in? In the US we have had these pop up at high schools. 
In my state if the student is over age 13 (I believe) they don’t need their parent’s approval at all. 
In fact, parents were not even told about the vaccination clinics. Parents in my town found out after the fact and held protests against it.</p>

        <p>To anyone they get into contact with while contagious. Including people unvaccinated for legitimate medical reasons.</p>
<p>Vaccines reduce the likelihood of contracting a disease, by allowing your body to recognize diseases and produce antibodies for them. This means you shouldn't get the disease if you do you'll be less contagious and if other people are vaccinated will have a lower chance of catching it. Lower chance of catching plus lower chance of transmission equals a win.</p>
<p>Now tell me, how does NOT vaccinating work?</p>

        <p>Well as an unvaxed you can have natural antibodies, no vax needed. Or if you have really low immunesystem that you for example cant vaxinate, I am pretty sure you are used to on how to behave and so on, since you had the condition long before covid and most likely other dieseases could be really bad, so thats one is a rule out too, otherwise lets everybody stay at home all the time for the rest of ur life (good enough if somebody stay at home when they are feeling sick, that would do the trick).   Also people for example working with kids tend to get sick a lot and have excellent immunesystem, if they have not they probably wouldnt work  with kids from the beginning.  </p>
<p>Well vaccines work by you lower the virulence of a virus just enough so it most likely wont be dangerous but the body still will make anti bodies to it after injection. Hopefully enough anti-bodys is generated so if you meet the virus the body will kill it before it spreads.</p>
<p>Now thats NOT how dna and m-rna vaccines work (do your homework) and I just answered your question</p>

        <p>No you haven't answered my question. You've thrown  a lot of pocket sand but haven't actually said how not vaccinating will help with the pandemic. Please elaborate on that. What advantages in stopping Covid are there to not vaccinating?</p>
<p>M-RNA vaccines have been in development since 1990, it's hardly a suprise that vast strides have been achieved 30 years later, with a global effort in place.</p>
<p>M-RNA vaccines skip the low-virulence infection step and go straight to teaching your body to recognize and react to the Covid infection, in the same way a body has learnt to fight an infection from an attenuated vaccine.</p>
<p>Also, an mRNA vaccine is not a DNA vaccine. None of the Covid vaccines are pDNA vaccines.</p>

        <p>No I have not. I just said no need to vaxinate younger, just let them be home if they are sick as with older people to. </p>
<p>Yes they have been and for instance this is modernas first product on the market. But they have not been tried since 1990 thats a totally different thing. I mean they have developed cold fusion since the 60ies or so, but this is the first big scale "try" with not knowing if there are longterm sideeffects or not (documented).  I have a colleage who have bein studying as a professinonal m-rna for 10 years, I trust that guy with my life on giving proper info.   </p>
<p>M-rna vaccince work so that you get the virus and get sick but you have learned the body to fight it. Thats not how ordinary vaccines work, so why even bother to call m-rna vaccines, vaccines at all?</p>
<p>And no, Moderna/Pfizer are m-rna, Jansen and astra zenaca and sputnik are dna, and the chineese vaccines are made in the old proper way..  </p>
<p>And now you can answer a question, do you know of any so called vaccine that has given so many sideeffects or deaths as these, or do you think that just that part is fearmongering and bogus, but the rest is not?</p>

        <p>I'm a parent wirh two kids in school going age.</p>
<p>Kids do get sick and pass diseases around to their families. Maybe kids aren't germ factories, but schools definitely are. Kids are just transmission vectors.</p>
<p>It isn't dehumanizing to say kids spread germs. It's the truth.</p>
<p>You're awfully deludes to deny the efficacy of vaccines. They work. Current stats show 99.3% of Covid deaths being recoded now are unvaccinated people.</p>

        <p>My point is this is not a vaccine if I get mmr. I don’t get measles. You take covid you get variants. You take medicine when good outweighs bad. In children this is very lopsided towards the bad. They should not take it.</p>

        <p>And some vaccines are effective against various variants. Some more than others.</p>
<p>But in other cases you need yearly Flu shots because flu mutates. Measles, mumps and rubella don't mutate as fast. You can get vaccinated against chicke pox and still get shingles.</p>
<p>Vaccines aren't a magic wand, but they do work.  The Covid one reduces likelihood of infection and transmission as well as reducing the severity if cought. Children are not immune to Covid. Yes they have a high survival rate but with the vaccine its even higher.</p>

        <p>Bullshit the side effects for children compared to risk are so lopsided it is not funny. Any one with common sense can see this. The truth is more people died of overdoses then covid the numbers just don’t add up ask yourself if you want to be a lab rat. Bottom line is this is a experimental vaccine at best. I am no lab eat. You want to be I’ll be sitting right here when you start having heart issues. Truth is they haven’t fully approved it because of liability of vaccine. They know they would be sued to death</p>
