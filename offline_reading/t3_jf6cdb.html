        <p>SS:  I saw this article earlier about newly found secretion glands located near the center of the head around the end of the nasal passages and the throat.  Stuck me that we're sticking long swabs in right about the same location to test for coronavirus.  One of those strange things you notice with too much time on your hands.</p>

        <p>Wow! Awesome post!</p>
<p>The MO of public health is to make us desperately unhealthy. This falls right in line with -bring the entire world to an unnecessary state of abject poverty-</p>
<p>Or maybe these little spit glands are great receptors for <a href="https://theconversation.com/morality-pills-may-be-the-uss-best-shot-at-ending-the-coronavirus-pandemic-according-to-one-ethicist-142601">covert moral bio enhancement</a>, either way, if you want to be healthy and alive, do the opposite of what the pols are telling us.</p>

        <p>Thanks!  When I first read the article, my first thought was that's exactly where they're sticking ridiculously long swabs to test for coronavirus. I found images of where the newly found glands are located and placed them side by side with a coronavirus swab test but the images didn't post with my post - I probably forgot to do something when I added the images and can't figure out how to add them now. (reddit posting newb obviously.  Comments I can do, posting not so much.)</p>
<p>I agree, it does fall right in line with making us desperately unhealthy, putting us in abject poverty, and hiding vital information from us.  Like our pineal gland which, according to the "experts", doesn't do much of anything so why not calcify it with fluoride, horrible excuses for "food", and other contaminants.</p>
<p>Those "morality pills" are horrifying.  "Promoting cooperation with moral enhancement" - what the heck? That sounds like some grade A Dr. Mengele experimentation bs for sure. It would not at all surprise me if those glands they're poking aren't something other than secretion glands as the researchers surmise. Seriously, how can people NOT see what those monsters are trying to do to us?  I just don't get it.</p>
<p>I'm happy at least one person here saw the correlation I was trying to make with this post :)  <a href="https://imgur.com/oSGqX1F">Here's the image</a> I tried to upload with the post that shows a side by side comparison.</p>

        <p>From your linked article: </p>
<p>&rt; For example, oxytocin, the chemical that, among other things, can induce labor or increase the bond between mother and child, may cause a person to be more empathetic and altruistic, more giving and generous. The same goes for psilocybin, the active component of “magic mushrooms.”</p>
<p>Joke is on that nerd, I microdose psilocybin at least once a month for chronic migraine and I'm still anti lockdown, anti mask, and anti new normal.</p>
