    <strong>What do you think the end goal of the vaccines are, for real?</strong>
    <p><p>I've heard a multitude of theories. Sterilization, population control, totalitarian control. What are you two cents on this?</p>
<p>I find it incredibly suspicious regardless that they fast tracked this stuff to production and did not even consider the potential health hazards that it has. </p>
<p>I'm not taking the jab. I do not need it; I am young, healthy, and I've had COVID already (probably multiple times). I've read about what it does to people and I am not going to risk my life with an experimental injection.</p></p>

        <p>It HAS to be sterilization... coupled with dumbing down the population somehow.  </p>
<p>We've already seen that it attacks the ovaries in women...  so that is one thing.</p>
<p>Whatever else is in there will only be seen over a longer period.  I think it will degrade synapses or brain matter, etc.  Whatever, i don't know...  but its obvious that SOME people are still too smart to fall for all of this bullshit.  So, the plan would be to do something about that as well.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, these fucking "vaccines" haven't been tested on a large scale or for a long time... AT ALL.</p>
<p>We are the ones in the clinical trial...  we are the test subjects.</p>
<p>They are recording all of this... the heart attacks, the strokes, the blood clots, etc.  And they are adjusting the "vaccine"/bioweapon on a daily basis... probably.</p>

        <p>I agree. If not the generation of people getting the vaccines, but the next generation of children, who will be born sterile.  </p>
<p>It would take at least ~16 years or so for that to be tested or confirmed, and I could see the powers that be, looking at it from a 20 year framework instead of a immediate 'sterilized and blood clotted' effect right after vaccination to divert all blame due to the short term memory of all these sheep.</p>

        <p>I think it would be fairly easy to concoct some bioweapon to sterilze... and to test it on animals.  And then run that shit into our systems.</p>
<p>What would be harder is to take into account the side effects in humans, as these bioweapons haven't been tested on us...  until now.</p>
<p>And that is what we are seeing... the paralysis, heart attacks, blood clots.   All of this is part of the research.  We are the guinea pigs.</p>

        <p>Well, the potential upside for mRNA tech is literally akin to 3D printing medical cures.  </p>
<p>Seems like a damn good reason to test something like a flu vaccine using the tech on a terrified populace to iron out the kinks to simply print money for pharma.</p>

<p>There's a saying, if the product is free, you are the product.  </p>

<p>The pharma companies are making hundreds of billions from the vaccine while subjugating the general public by using fear as their tool. The virus was created to kick-start this.</p>

        <p>i think its actually beyond this, ultimately money only serves one objective which is the control it affords over any situation. they already have all the money, and almost all of the control, this is genocide, the deliberate weakening and culling of the global population</p>

        <p>The 4th Industrial Revolution:</p>
<p>The WEF held a pandemic response training meeting 6 months before Covid-19... coincidence?</p>
<p>AI is here and ready thanks to the roll out of 5G.
This AI will destroy a lot of peoples jobs and livelihoods as processes become automated.
We are at a stage in history where the top 1% no longer need to leech of us, so we are useless to them.</p>
<p>So the vast majority of the population who will be unemployed will be placed on a universal basic income.
(It is already being tested in Ireland and Wales, you can find mainstream news articles on it)</p>
<p>Vaccine passports were the target behind this entire pandemic because they are a guise for Digital ID
(The digital vaccine passports in UK were discovered to have other parameters such as the individuals: social circle, ethnicity, criminal convictions, alleged criminal behaviour etc etc)
(I have video proof of a news report on this if you need)
So these passes were never about a vaccine it is all about enforcing a digital ID on people so they can be tracked and monitored anywhere.</p>
<p>Their aim is to bring to the West the same social credit system as China...meaning your access to the Universal Basic income is tied to these digital passes.
This is incredibly dangerous because it means whoever controls these systems can set whatever parameters they want... 
In China people who do not toe the line have a lower social credit so they have limited access to goods and facilities, even food in some cases.</p>
<p>The "vaccines" most likely have something to do depopulation to make it easier to control the rest of us who remain under this new totalitarian system.</p>

        <p>Not a big conspiracy guy. I think the end goal is to get a shitty, unreliable vaccine technology into popular acceptance without resolving the problems the manufacturers couldn't figure out. Over 20 years now researching it and the pharma corps still don't know how to make it safe enough for human use. But the benefits are worth the risks! Trust them....</p>

        <p>Social control is probably a massive part of it look at how easy now they could squash any type of upset. Bam - Lockdown. Have you spoken to people you know recently?

        <p>Same I believe social control is the reasoning. They are attempting to ease us into authoritarian measures and get us to want it. In my opinion they want to introduce a social credit system like China but they knew they couldn’t just start it overnight. Have to walk us into it</p>

        <p>I think the governments are using the vaccine as a savior to hide behind. They know they ruined the world by exploiting the people using this virus. They realized it can’t go on forever so they will use the virus as a savior (but really it’s herd immunity, and against nothing more than an cold virus)   </p>
<p>Also, the vaccine companies making $$$. Oh what’s that the vaccines are free? Nothings free. Taxes are paying for it. And the inflated economy is just a sneaky type of tax.</p>

        <p>I agree. I don’t think they’re organized enough to pull off mass sterilization. I think they just want to give people a false sense of safety with these vaccines so they can get the economy back to the way it was with people going out to shitty venues, spending money/gas, useless commutes when remote work is better in almost every way except for the people that hate being around their families, and most importantly, to ease up our unemployment and social welfare institutions.</p>

        <p>Alternative theory: I think they just released a vaccine so they can “end” the fake pandemic they’ve been milking for political gain (take a look at all the socialist bills passed under the guise of ‘covid relief’, and others passed during pure distraction). They can’t admit the virus isn’t lethal, because then everyone will be up in arms over what the past year and a half was about...so they have to end it “properly”, meanwhile big pharma lines their pockets and maybe even gets to set up the sweet endless income of “boosters” which they’ll funnel back to their favorite politicians.

        <p>Best case scenario? They’ll just keep rolling out boosters and profiting off of them.</p>
<p>Most likely? They will increase infertility, autoimmune dysfunction, and cancer, which people will not correlate with getting the vaccine. </p>
<p>Worst case? It’s a bioweapon, or future boosters are the real bioweapon. And/Or they’ll roll out the mandatory vaccine passports and have total and complete control over us forever and ever, amen.</p>

        <p>So many theories. All are "awesome", considering what the various shareholders will gain, of course, not the vaccinated. Wonder if they view it the same way, how much "gain" this whole project is worth.</p>

        <p>1) None of the Above. It's to vaccinate people against a virus that has killed hundreds of thousands worldwide, even though the survival rate is high.  No one is being required by their government to take it. Their employers? Sure. But those aren't the government.</p>
<p>2) No one has become sterilized from taking the vaccine. You sound like the people who think a chicken pox vaccine will give them autism.</p>
<p>3) Unlimited financial resources can speed up any R&amp;D project. Plus RNA technology has been in development for over a decade.  If you aren't comfortable with it, J&amp;J is an adenovirus (like many vaccines you've had before) and has only proven risky with a minute percentage of young women. </p>
<p>4) If you're feeling this paranoid, it might be a good idea to step away from Reddit and get some mental health assistance.</p>

        <p>You talk as if you're an authority, but instead you're spreading "dangerous misinformation."</p>
<p>3- J&amp;J is a viral vector vaccine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_vector_vaccine">which is new</a>, and is nothing like vaccines anyone here "has had before." It's only been used for vaccinating Ebola.  They spliced DNA from a virus, and that DNA infects the cell nucleus.  The end result is custom mRNA code in your cell just like mRNA vaccines.   Watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13qT7wLxkvU#t=1m30s">Medcram video</a> if you don't understand the science.</p>
<p>If you want a normal vaccine you have to leave the country and go to a country with an inactivated virus vaccine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_COVID-19_vaccine_authorizations">on this map</a>.  </p>
<p>People here are just speculating.  None of us said we know for certain, we're just throwing out ideas of what could be behind the government's misinformation campaigns to push these experimental vaccines.   Stop acting like throwing out possibilities means we are paranoid/delusional.</p>

        <p>My sister works in hospice. In case you don’t know most of her hospice patients have less than 30 days to live. Directives from the top state anyone on hospice that dies after a positive covid test or WITH Covid symptoms is to be listed as died FROM covid. These people are already dying from other illnesses. My sisters company works with 100’s of patients each month and she is only one company in one city. I would imagine that most medical facilities have been doing the same thing since any covid deaths bring in government money. The numbers are a lie, the test is a lie and if you really believe the government cares about you at all I feel bad for you. 
Point of interest if you die from covid life insurance doesn’t pay since it is a “pandemic “</p>
