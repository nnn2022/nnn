    <strong>University of California vax policy faq. Really read point 8</strong>
    <p><p>https://ucnet.universityofcalifornia.edu/coronavirus/employee-covid-vaccine-policy-faqs.pdf</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this a one-time mandate or will I be required to get boosters or annual shots?</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a permanent policy. Infectious disease experts anticipate that annual or more frequent boosters will be necessary, and receipt of boosters will be required, consistent with product labeling, in the same way that the initial vaccination is required by this policy and subject to the same exceptions and deferrals.</p></p>

        <p>I decided to look up who's been donating to the UC system lately and this is what I found:</p>
<p>TLDR: The guy behind American Express and Citigroup is funding an institute to study the human brain using "brain-computer interfaces, artificial intelligence analyses of big datasets, neuroimaging, and next-generation genome sequencing", with help from the US government. Also, the owner/founder of a big subprime credit card company is funding brain research to study "compassion".</p>
<p>This is about "social impact investing", guys: the privatized version of China's "social credit". Your brain data, used to predict your life outcomes, and all of it traded in financial markets. </p>
<p>https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/uc-supporters-step-forward-generous-year-end-donations</p>
<p>&rt;In November, philanthropists Joan and Sanford I. “Sandy” Weill, of the Weill Family Foundation, gave $106M to UC San Francisco, UC Berkeley and the University of Washington for the creation of the Weill Neurohub, a research network that aims to speed the development of new treatments for neurological and psychiatric diseases.</p>
<p>&rt;UC San Diego received $100M from longtime benefactor Denny Sanford to establish a landmark institute that will explore the neurobiology of compassion</p>
<p>https://bsa.berkeley.edu/news/announcing-weill-neurohub</p>
<p>&rt;We want to thank Joan and Sandy Weill for this generous philanthropic commitment and the many ways in which they have demonstrated their support of Berkeley and the UC mission. This extends beyond philanthropy and includes Sandy’s contributions as a member of the Board of Visitors. </p>
<p>&rt;The immense knowledge gained over decades of basic research can now be married to advanced technologies — brain-computer interfaces, artificial intelligence analyses of big datasets, neuroimaging, and next-generation genome sequencing — to advance new treatments for neurological and psychiatric diseases. Through an agreement signed between the Department of Energy and the Weill Family Foundation, the Weill Neurohub will be able to collaborate with leading researchers and potentially access unique capabilities at DOE’s 17 National Laboratories, which are world-class centers of excellence in bioengineering, artificial intelligence, imaging, and data science. </p>
<p>https://weill.ucsf.edu/about</p>
<p>&rt;By bringing basic research in psychiatry into the fold of the neurosciences, the UCSF Weill Institute will be especially impactful. This new vision promises to transform mental health, where there has been so little progress for so many decades.</p>
<p>https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2019-07-22-landmark-gift-to-create-institute-of-empathy-and-compassion-at-UC-San-Diego.aspx</p>
<p>&rt;The new institute will employ state-of-the-art neuroscience technologies, including sophisticated neuroimaging, to identify and map brain activity created by empathic behavior, quantify the factors promoting or inhibiting compassionate behavior and then design new methods to increase empathic signals in the brain.</p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Premier_Bank</p>
<p>&rt;The bank was founded in 1986 and is owned and controlled by T. Denny Sanford.[1][2] The typical First Premier Bank MasterCard user uses the card for about 18 months before moving to another card with better terms; Sanford described the company as offering a "lifeline" for those with poor credit.[3]
In 2007, the bank settled a case with the New York Attorney General who claimed the bank used deceptive practices to market its credit cards. The bank paid $4.5 million as part of the deal.[2]
As of December 2010, Premier Bank was reportedly offering a credit card with a 79.9% interest rate and a $300 limit. This was cited by Senator Bernie Sanders as an example of what he called "extortion and loan sharking".[4]</p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_I._Weill</p>
<p>Just read the whole career bio: this guy has had a hand in practically every big bank involved in the last economic crisis. Of note is that he's also been heavily invested in insurance, heading the merger between Travelers and Citigroup (and the government lobbying necessary to make it happen). It's all about risk management...</p>
