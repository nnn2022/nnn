    <strong>Rude employee at Walgreens today who got on my case for not wearing a mask.</strong>
    <p><p>Don't know if this is the right sub, but I want to vent anyway. Hopefully it won't get removed.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm seriously wondering if I should report him to the manager for his rudeness. I was out driving today and stopped by a Walgreens that I regularly go to.</p>
<p>I forget my mask at home, so I went inside the store without one, instead pulling up my shirt around my mouth as a replacement. When I got to the cash register later, an employee who I regularly interact with when I go there, was rather rude to me. </p>
<p>"What are you doing?" He said impatiently, noticing I was holding up my shirt.</p>
<p><em>Reaches behind counter and hands me a mask</em></p>
<p>"You say you're brilliant, and yet you can't even put on a mask?"</p>
<p>What the fuck? Maybe I'm just overreacting, but what an asshole. I've had other instances where I've been out on a quick store run, and I haven't been called out like that for having my shirt held up around my face when I left my mask home. The nerve of some people.</p></p>

        <p>That was way out of line and no you're not overreacting. You are better than me I wouldn't have bothered pulling up my shirt, and I would probably would have used some colorful language. Report it to corporate.</p>

        <p>Why make such a big deal about it? I bet 99.99% of the customers that come through wear a mask, just let one slide and not be a dick about it. I'm talking about the cashier, BTW.</p>

        <p>Imagine thinking a mask is somehow more effective than a shirt pulled over your face.</p>
