        <p>People looked at graphs of deaths from the Spanish Flu and decided covid would follow a similar path.</p>
<p>No seriously, that's where this started.</p>

        <p>The other coronaviruses that afflict us are highly seasonal, and transmit poorly in the summer. The initial theory was that this one would follow the same pattern. When that theory was prominent, the idea was that there would be a natural lull in the summer, followed by a natural resurgence in the fall. This doesn't seem to be the case.</p>
<p>The "second waves" we're seeing in nations like Australia come from their lockdowns being lifted while less than 1% of their population is immune to the disease. Florida prevented the first wave with an unnecessary prophylactic lockdown. Now they're going through the initial wave.</p>

        <p>Second wave means a significant mutation came along that lets it infect recovered people already. There is no second wave because data has shown a slow rate of mutation for covid. What we have are places that never had their first wave getting it now. Its a false buzz word.</p>

        <p>What really doesn’t add up is if masks do work at slowing the “virus”, this is prolonging the “pandemic” since it will take longer to reach the coveted “herd immunity”. Now whether you believe any of those three things are real or not it’s what these things in positions of power are spouting. And why would they want to prolong their emergency powers? History may have the answer</p>

        <p>I'm not an epidemiologist but I do statistical analysis at work. I did my own analysis of county level data for the US because I wanted to determine what I can trust and what I can't. Here's my take:</p>
<p>The southern states were growing steadily while they conducted fewer tests per capita. Now they are conducting more tests and their daily case counts are skyrocketing. They're still on the first wave 
because they never dipped. I looked at percentage of population that is getting sick at once and saw that many southern are worse now than New York ever was. To me, that explains why Arizona is using more freezer trucks to store dead bodies than New York did when its morgues were overrun.</p>
<p>The northeast tested aggressively early on, especially New York. They were the first to wake up to the numbers. It seems to me like their policies worked and now their cases have kept relatively stable even as testing continues to increase. I took the test myself and it's free and easy, there was a huge line for it. If any northeast state has an uptick that would be a second wave for them.</p>
<p>Also, as a percentage of population getting new cases, I saw that Boston was actually doing worse than NYC during that first spike but it's much smaller than NYC and people focus on totals not percentages because our public schools don't teach enough math.</p>
<p>Also surprisingly, I found a 0.15 Pearson coefficient between population density and total percentage of population infected. That's so close to 0 that I can safely say that rural counties are equally as in danger as urban ones. That tells me Covid19 is not spread by how close you live to others, but rather at places that urban and rural areas have in common: like grocery stores, bars/restaurants, churches, etc. It seems like the public health measures around stores and bars are having the most impact. But policies about walking outside or staying indoors are not. So based on what I learned looking at the numbers the way for any local government to reduce the percentage of people who will have chronic lung and heart damage after this epidemic is to regulate crowds and masks in stores and restaurants not in the street or in a beach.</p>
<p>Zero of the counties I saw were anywhere close to herd immunity. I extrapolated uncaught cases and the highest seemed to be 40% and most of the country was at around 20%. Covid herd immunity requires around 80%. So if the southern states continue to get more and more cases they can keep climbing for another year or two before they reach Covid herd immunity. By then the virus will mutate and that immunity may not do much good.</p>

        <p>Much of the research and data coming out says only 15-30% herd immunity is needed. Your numbers are WAYYY high. </p>
<p>T-cell and cross immunity.</p>

        <p>I'm not a medical expert. I just looked at the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The higher the R0 the higher the H.I.T (Herd Immunity Threshold)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Influenza has an R0 of 1.8 and an H.I.T. of around 44%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SARS had an estimated R0 of 5 and its H.I.T. is estimated around 80%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covid19 is related to SARS and its R0 measurements are tricky because what we're observing is the R0 of populations that are taking steps to reduce it's R0 (like social distance, masks, etc.). So Covid is estimated at R0 = 6 which would put it at around 83% of the population to be immune.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measles has an R0 of 18 and it requires about 95% of the population in order to achieve herd immunity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's not even mentioning the fact that Covid19 antibodies fade from our system similar to influenza. So people would have to get re-infected every year to reach herd immunity levels.  That would be a lot of people who will get post-covid pre-existing lung conditions. That would do a number on the healthcare system.</p>

        <p>What about all the studies on cross immunity and T-cell memory? Or those showing lasting coronavirus immunity?</p>
<p>So youre saying a vaccine wouldn't work either?</p>
<p>And what is a "post-covid pre-existing lung condition"? Links? Source?</p>

<p>Nope. I said no such thing. Personally I hope the vaccine comes soon.</p>
<p>I said that I didn't see anywhere in the country that was close to herd immunity. It seems to me that waiting for enough people to get infected before we have herd immunity would take a while and I would imagine that there is a possibility that before then that people's immunity will wear out and/or the coronavirus will mutate. Again, I'm not a medical statistician, I use stats and machine learning at work so I applied myself to the county-level data in the US so that I could draw my own conclusions instead of blindly trusting the news.</p>

        <p>The T-cell discovery sounds like a good reason to hypothesize cross immunity. Somebody should do a followup study ASAP to see if it actually works. It would be awesome if we could just give everybody the common cold with a coronavirus and then they have either reduced susceptibility or reduced symptoms when it comes to Covid19.  </p>
<p>&rt;And how would a vaccine be effective if immunity lasts for such a short time?</p>
<p>As effective as the yearly flu vaccine, I imagine.</p>

        <p>There is plenty of research going on and cross immunity is being shown. Thats why "herd immunity" numbers are suspected to be between 15-40%. SARS patients from 2003-2004 are immune to COVID 19. </p>
<p>T-cell memory research has been around for decades thanks to HIV research.</p>
