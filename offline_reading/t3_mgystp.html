    <p><p>Is would make far more sense that the jabs are to kill off billions, especially given how they absurdly paused and locked down humanity for over a year to implement this. Saving 1% would not be worth stopping society for, whereas killing off half clearly would, if that is the top agenda, as they have admitted that it is.</p></p>

        <p>Propaganda and fear is to shut down logic, so as people are more likely to believe a fairytale about what is going on. The ruthless elite cared so much about 1% of people who are already weak or near death, that they shut down society and now have experimental injections to save the day.
Most people around here know that that is not how the real world works, Santa and his reindeers are not bringing us all life-saving jabs, as much as it would be nice to believe. The people at the top are cut-throat and use Problem&rt;Reaction&rt;Solution to implement their plans. If they release a virus why would they want to save us from it? No, the virus is simply a pretext to give them access to put something into our bodies which they have prepared earlier, and were desperate for us to accept. It needed to be a big lie in order that enough of us would comply. It could all seem like an accident as it was supposedly rushed and experimental, so the official story goes, but make no mistake the kill-off you will witness by 2026 is no accident, every part of it had been planned precisely, including the bioweapon poisons which are being injected into people’s arms.</p>

        <p>It is something you will have to find for yourself if it is still out there, as it is illegal to share it, but having said that there is a BMJ article discussing it which is fine https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n627</p>
