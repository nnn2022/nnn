    <strong>"Back of the envelope" math to show why, even if there were NO negative "second-order" impacts of lockdown, lockdowns are still a bad trade off</strong>
    <p><p>As we know, life is more than being at home and not being allowed to see friends. Life is going to the movies, meeting up with strangers to go on dates, going to concerts, and seeing family. We could probably all live to 100 years old if we suspended ourselves in a vegetative state, hooked up to a million machines. Obviously, this is not living. Neither is staying at home. Reduced quality of life is a significant, direct impact of lockdowns.</p>
<p>Let's take Sweden for an example, as they had only a light lockdown. People were able to continue their normal lives, for the most part. Let's assume that EVERY death in Sweden would have been prevented if there had been a stricter lockdown. Obviously, this claim is extremely dubious at best, and would mean that all 10,000 lives lost "due to covid" would have been saved. Let's assume that, on average, every person who died had 10 years left. Again, given what we know about the virus, this is a rather extreme over-exaggeration in favour of pro-lockdowners. We come to a total of 100,000 life years "saved" by locking down. Because we've run the numbers in the most favourable way to pro-lockdowners possible, this should also cover any "long-term effects" arguments.</p>
<p>Sweden has a population of approximately 10,000,000 people. Suppose that, on average, during a hypothetical lockdown, those 10 million people had their quality of life diminished 1 point on a 10 point scale, or 10 percentage points on average, for one year. Given that lockdowns have been in force for nearly a year, and have reduced quality of life FAR more than 10% for the vast majority of people over that year, this again is extremely favourable to pro-lockdowners, especially when you consider that 1 out of 4 young adults has considered suicide. Running these numbers, we see that, on a subjective measure of well-being, 1,000,000 "years" of life would have been lost due to lockdowns. 10% reduction in one year for 10,000,000 people = 1,000,000 equivalent life years lost, when we look at quality of life.</p>
<p>Even if there were NO other negative impacts to lockdowns other than staying home for 1 year, and the direct, associated negative impact of staying home on quality of life, lockdowns are STILL a poor trade off.</p>
<p>In fact, if lockdowns reduce life satisfaction by 10% for one year, then, at least for Sweden, the effect would be at least TEN TIMES WORSE, if not more than that.</p></p>
