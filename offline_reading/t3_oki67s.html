    <p><p>In the US 331 million doses were administered as of a week ago. That's close to the population of the entire US.  Most vaxxed people get 2, so:</p>
<p>let's say 180 million people were vaccinated - 5,946 US residents have died following the vaccine (source: VAERS). That's about 30,000 to 1 odds - even the cheapest state lottery game has farther odds than that for the jackpot.</p>
<p>The odds of being struck by lightning: 1 in 1.2 million. </p>
<p>One out of every 30,000 people in the US dies after being vaccinated. Dies.</p></p>

        <p>VAERS usually has inaccurate and incorrect reports.  One person even reported that the flu vaccine turned him into the hulk.  However, for the sake of this argument, let’s say that those numbers are correct.</p>
<p>According to Google, your figure of approximately 180 million people being vaccinated is correct.  But look at the death rate of COVID vaccines.  30,000 to 1 odds gives the vaccine a mortality rate of 0.0033%.    In the US, COVID has a <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality">mortality rate of 1.8%</a>.  That means that you are a 545 times more likely to die from COVID than the vaccine.</p>
<p>545 out of every 30,000 people in the US dies after getting COVID. Dies.</p>

<p>Interesting you used that wording.  That's called correlation, and that's the vast majority of Covid deaths.  Deaths after a positive test, not deaths from Covid.  That'd be like me quoting a figure for people who doe after eating a hamburger and saying the hamburger killed them.</p>
<p>For blood clots, stroke, myocarditis etc we have a mechanism of how the vax causes these things.  So, it's correlation connected to a known cause and highwr than baseline incidence.  Also, these things are occurring disproportionately in young people with no comorbidities.  The exact opposite of most Covid deaths.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you may or may not get a Covid infection even if you're exposed repeatedly.  Your body can fight it off before ot takes hold.  The vaccine bypassses most of your body's defenses and goes directly into your blood.  With Covid infection, you have two maybes.  Maybe you get a Covid infection, and maybe it kills you.  With the vaccine, it's 100% chance you'll have the toxic spike in your blood, amd maybe you'll die.</p>
<p>That's why you can't only go by a straight comparison of chance of death.  You have to adjust the Covid death figure by the chance of actually getting the infection for your demographic.</p>

        <p>I am fully aware of the misleading effects of causation and correlation. In fact, I have been waiting for someone to call me out on this. The same thing can be applied to the vaccine deaths. In fact, “The U.S. FDA requires healthcare providers to report any death after a COVID-19 vaccination to VAERS, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause. Reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem.”Source.</p>
<p>The point of adjusting the death rate is also valid. However, even after factoring in the fact that nearly 33 million people have been infected in the US (roughly a tenth of the population), you are still 54 times more likely to die after receiving the vaccine (this is not factoring in the fact that the deaths reported after a vaccine were possibly not caused by the vaccine).</p>

        <p>I see the point you are trying to make, and if it were based in reality, I would totally agree and I would get vaccinated as a 550X risk factor shows benefit outweighing risk.  However, very few people died as a result of a coronavirus infection.  The coronavirus family has been, and will continue to be, the 2nd leading cause of the common cold.  What killed the majority of those at the height of the pandemic was being put on a ventilator.  I teach the biology and science behind respiratory care, and I know that the people getting thrown into operating a ventilator don't know shit.  Except for the pulmonologists.  And they are by the bedside 0.5% of the time.  Making all of those ventilators was going to be a death sentence for a lot of people, and all you need to do is ask a pulmonologist or critical care respiratory therapist.</p>
<p>Now I know you are not in the same field as I, and so you probably don't believe me, but far far fewer people would have died had they not been put on ventilators.  As an analogy, most cancer patients succumb to the effects from chemotherapy, with a significantly reduced number succumbing to the effects of radiation.  Cancer itself, as a biological process, takes a long time in most cases to kill a person.</p>
<p>And so that mortality probability is so far distorted from reality that it is useless.  Another point, which is probably the most significantly ignored piece of historical fact ever, is that most people, even if we just take the US, where coronaviruses have caused the common cold for generations, have a baseline level of immunity to the spike protein already.  The four coronaviruses known to cause colds use the same mechanism to gain entry and infect.  Though the spike protein isn't identical between the 4 strains and SARS-CoV-2, there are an estimated 18-24 antigenic sites.  They can't all be mutated differently, the spike protein would have lost it's infective quality if that were the case.</p>
<p>And so a bunch of us have immunity, and will likely NEVER get infected.  Giving the instructions to our cells to start making something which we already possess immune reactivity to?  That is the textbook definition of how to create an autoimmune disorder.</p>
<p>And I'm not making this shit up.  My textbooks from the late 80's/early 90's clearly stated this information.</p>

        <p>I'd like to request clarification on a couple things.  First, I don't understand the ventilator argument.  I can't seem to find anything that states that ventilators are the cause of death for COVID patients.  Could you perhaps provide a source or a explanation for ventilators killing people?  Saying that the "mortality rate is distorted" because of ventilators is a textbook example of causation not being equal to correlation.  The most serious cases are put on ventilators, so naturally there is a higher mortality rate.  I doubt that many people have immunity either.  I'm pretty sure sars-cov-2 is one of the only coronaviruses that use the ace-2 receptor.</p>

        <p>ACE2 is a peptidase family enzyme.  For sure, coronavirus NL63 attaches to ACE2.  So does SARS-1.  The structure of ACE2 contains an aminopeptidase N domain, and the enzyme aminopeptidase N (APN) is the attachment protein for another CoV, 229E.  A paper in Nature last year described this binding: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369385/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369385/</a></p>
<p>Since the spike protein is highly conserved in all human CoVs; suggests that the cell attachment protein for infection entry is also going to be conserved.  Put frankly, 4 of the 7 known human CoVs bind ACE2 (NL63, 229E, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2).  Arguments could be made that 229E only uses APN, but I do not know of a single paper describing the distinct lack of ACE2 binding.  ACE2 has an APN domain, if 229E can bind APN then it almost certainly will bind to the APN domain present in ACE2.</p>
<p>I know that the first argument against the dangers of mechanical ventilation will default to what you stated: the sickest get ventilated; they are more likely to die.</p>
<p>What kind of evidence would suggest that there is a known issue with mechanical ventilation?  Doctors publicly stating that overuse of ventilators is causing unnecessary deaths?  Those are abundant.  Over the last 40 years, numerous studies have investigated ventilator-induced-lung-injury.  Massively expand the use of ventilators operated by people with very little education, and that injury frequency is guaranteed to not get better.  </p>
<p>Studies on absolute mortality are not plentiful, almost non-existent. A recent one published in JAMA by Northwell Health looking at NY patients show close to 90% died while receiving ventilation: <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765184">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765184</a></p>
<p>A news story summarizing the results: <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/04/24/ventilator-study">https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/04/24/ventilator-study</a> (though I will openly state that I hate the way that science dissemination is going the way of news articles).</p>
<p>If you are already in a mindset that ventilators are not dangerous, then nothing I can say or show will affect that mindset.  40 years looking at ways to alleviate ventilator induced lung injury, there is no way that doesn't get worse in this current situation.</p>
