    <strong>Pro-Vaccine subs on Reddit have become cults. It needs to stop now- they are endangering lives.</strong>
    <p><p>Edit: Long rant below. Sorry.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You know how you get banned in other subs for an irrelevant comment posted in another sub? That tactic is the bread and butter of a certain vaccine-obsessed subreddit I just got banned from. What was my "crime"?- I posted that the COVID vaccines are dangerous and likely to sterilize people or cause deaths (which they in fact are) and that this seems like population control, in THIS subreddit, while my comments in that sub were simply along the lines of "people should do their own research before getting the vaccine" or "you shouldn't ban people for asking valid questions about these vaccines".</p>
<p>Read through my comments if there is any doubt about this truth. You might notice I tiptoed around certain vaccine-obsessed cult subreddits to avoid setting off their incredibly oversensitive emotions, but that didn't stop them from scouring my posts made in OTHER subreddits to find a reason to ban me. Can't have open healthy discussion about a brand new, rushed, untested, experimental mRNA treatment that is being forced on the population for a disease with a 99.8% survival rate now, can we?</p>
<p>It's hilarious how they try to satirize you when you say "I am not anti-vax"- it's the complete truth, I personally have never been anti-vax, I am only anti-COVID-vax, as I assume most are here. But that logic doesn't work for them, not much logic going around there from mods and superusers (the question-nothing-take your poison-and shut up Gestapo) anyway.</p>
<p>But- the worst part of it is- the part that makes me angry and sad for those whose suffering they are causing and/or contributing to: MANY of their users and mods quite obviously have ZERO medical knowledge or qualifications, and it is easy to see that they get their information about the vaccines from Youtube videos, CNN, and all the other lying mainstream media who hasn't told the truth about COVID in the last year. They are running around masquerading as doctors who know all the answers to everything about vaccines and COVID and I wonder if they know how I should allocate my 401k? Yeah...those 19 year olds are experts about COVID vaccines, so they must know finance- best not to question them.</p>
<p>You see a post from someone suffering side effects, often severe and extremely concerning (chest pain, sores all over the body, vaginal bleeding, missed periods, literal fucking SEIZURES), and the "experts" over on the Reddit vaccine cult subs say "Have you had a COVID test recently? Get tested for COVID and take tylenol and get some rest"- FUCK THAT- I won't say what I do to avoid doxxing myself (you know how vicious the Reddit nutcases are), but I can say that I know enough that I read through those symptoms and I'm like- that person needs to go the ER NOW, that person is likely screwed but they need an ambulance, or holy shit I'm so sad that they lost their baby.</p>
<p>My point is- this spread of misinformation being paraded as scientific fact is incredibly dangerous, and may even amount to civil or criminal legal violations. It is illegal to act as a doctor and provide medical advice which leads to death or serious injury- and I am willing to bet these pro-vaccine cults are responsible for multiple deaths or severe injuries. Their censorship is not just wrong and against the First Amendment (what can we do with this shit federal government), but it is VERY dangerous, and potentially illegal. I have sent the mods a stern message, not expecting too much from that except ridiculing me as a "conspiracy theorist", "anti-vaxxer", or whatever new unapplicable and illogical slur they've made up today. But I do not care- I am tired of this bullshit- I am escalating this concern to the Reddit Admins as well, because fuck Reddit and its bullshit censorship. I intend to go to the FCC, FDA, CDC (HAHAHA JUST KIDDING), state governors, congressional reps, and any other regulatory agencies I can find to pursue action to stop this spread of dangerous medical propaganda. I'm not fucking around anymore with this clown world, where incompetent idiot children rule and are given menial power which they abuse as much as possible- I'm not sitting around to watch this Great Reset stupidity thrive and infect the minds of good people and lead them to their doom.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I'm sorry for the rant, but it needs to be said: the pro-vaccine subreddits are dangerous and they need to be handled by adults and qualified professionals (AKA, not Fauci), not the children they have moderating them and using them to spread false medical information. Fuck Reddit, this place is disgusting, I can't believe I ever came back.</p></p>

        <p>Absolutely spot-on. They're getting desperate. Every singe COVID-related subreddit has now implemented a bot that automatically permabans anyone with any comment history, regardless of context, in any skeptic subreddit, including this subreddit, r/CoVaxSkeptical and r/LockdownSkepticism.</p>
<p>Eventually, any and all negative side-effects will be considered "<em>medical misinformation"</em> and immediately deleted, as we've already seen on r/CovidVaccinated. In response, the best thing you can do is remind them of something the CDC actually admitted themselves, that there is no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people with autoimmune conditions.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>"People with autoimmune conditions may receive a COVID-19 vaccine. However, they should be aware that no data are currently available on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines for people with autoimmune conditions. People from this group were eligible for enrollment in some of the clinical trials. More information about vaccine clinical trials can be found below."</em> <strong>Source is directly quoted from CDC.gov here, updated April 2021:</strong> https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html</p>
<p>This may explain why we're seeing countless autoimmune nightmare horror stories each and every day, even lasting up to months on end. <em>"Given that autoimmune diseases are often rare and may not be easily diagnosed with blood tests, imaging, and other standard tests, clinicians who aren’t familiar with these illnesses can find them perplexing."</em> <strong>Source is directly quoted from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov here:</strong> https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114837/</p>

        <p>Yes, they absolutely are, and that makes me slightly happier. It is possible my ban was done by a bot- I was not aware they were doing that, thank you for that information which adds to the concern about the insanity happening in those subs. </p>
<p>I have mentioned the CDC's own statements in past comments- it always seems to fall on deaf ears. Somehow they always devolve into calling you an anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorist. </p>
<p>The term "conspiracy theorist" is starting to become a term of endearment, because when have we gotten anything wrong over the last year??? Not once. We even use the words of their own gods (Fauci) to show their ignorance, but they still attack. All the shit they gaslighted us for over the past year we were right about the whole time. Now we say "hey maybe take a step back and research these vaccines a bit more before blindly and irreversibly injecting them into your body", yet they continue to use their slurs and attack us at their own peril. Fuck it, we all know our lives are FAR better than any of theirs, because we think for ourselves and refuse to follow the herd- we will not be sheep led to slaughter. At least we tried.</p>
<p>Thank you for the links! I've got an encyclopedia of personal research dedicated to COVID and the vaccines- these will make great additions.</p>

        <p>Sorry that's happening to you. Street drugs are a road you seriously do not want to go down. You can go to different docs! Pain specialists should be able to help you more than a general practitioner will. Also, I know that it's not something everybody is comfortable with, but acupuncture can really help with pain. I don't like youtube's censorship now but there are some great videos on there about pain management meditation techniques. I had an injury last year and guided meditation surprisingly helped a lot. Hope you feel better soon!</p>

        <p>Thank you, and I really really love your post, I’m with you 1000%.  I already do acupuncture but meditation is something I haven’t been able to have a breakthrough with yet but I do wim hof breathing exercises which help about 50% but only while I’m doing the breaths. Then it’s back to horrible endless pain. I’ll look up guided meditation. I’ve done that too but not for pain (for anxiety). I believe in it, though. The power of the mind. I wish my mind was strong enough. Maybe this is my challenge to help me finally break through!!</p>

        <p>I have been dealing with the same thing. I completely understand your reasoning for finally succumbing to the pressure. You are forced to choose between two shitty options- take something you don't trust which may harm you, or cause a divide with your family and friends- I chose the second option and have not looked back. </p>
<p>I'm terribly sorry about your suffering though. Have you seen a doctor about this or reported your symptoms to VAERS? May I ask what you've been doing to fight the side effects? I'm not sure if you're serious about street drugs, but if you are, which do you believe would help your situation? (I don't necessarily support using street drugs for this but it's an interesting thought)</p>

        <p>Hell I just got banned from the pokemongo subreddit for sharing sentiments in regards to another person was tired of, that too many threads of 'i caught _____ while getting vaccinated' had no place on the fucking subreddit because there was an influx of those posts and becoming mildly annoying and arguably pro vaccine propaganda. Even merely calling the 'vaccine' debatable got me banned. </p>

        <p>It's rampant. I've gotten banned from multiple other subs without ever commenting or interacting at all, simply because of having joined this and a few other subs. Kinda like how WhitePeopleTwitter bans you if you follow r/conservative or a few others. It's fucked up and at this point its become dangerous, as we know it would be. The leftists want the destruction of this country and to usher in Communism, which they have not yet realized will not be good for them either, but only for a select few- namely all the insane ped0s in DC and Hollywood. </p>
<p>Their obsession with suppressing open discourse only shows that it is right to question the vaccines. What are they hiding?</p>

        <p>Exactly, if we cant even have open honest discourse on these topics and instantly be met with getting silenced by people we disagree with, the division will never stop and the country(s) will become more polarized than ever. Eventually things will come to a head where people wont stand for the shit anymore.</p>
<p>I find it insane you can't rationally question this emergency authorized vaccine with zero long term human studies involving side effects of these brand new mRna vaccines without being called an anti-vaxxer and the topics are "non-negotiable" as if youre supposed to fall in line with the propagandized pro-vaccine narrative otherwise you're banned.</p>
<p>Again, these people are absolutely batshit, irrational, and insane power hungry mods enforcing big pharmas agenda on the low IQ people who accept it blindly.</p>
<p>I'm really fucking tired of hearing about people being vaccinated, vaccines in general or covid being injected into every unrelated conversation or people virtue signaling about being vaccinated.</p>

        <p>&rt;It's hilarious how they try to satirize you when you say "I am not anti-vax"- it's the complete truth, I personally have never been anti-vax, I am only anti-COVID-vax, as I assume most are here. But that logic doesn't work for them</p>
<p>There is logic when it comes to wanting the vaccine, but it's inherently broken</p>
<p>"Anti-vax" has been carefully persuaded for decades now</p>
<p>People don't want to say no, and be labelled a "stupid anti-vaxxer"</p>
<p>It's mostly social conditioning</p>

        <p>Yep, for years they've been priming the populace to hate anti-vaxxers and immediately discredit their viewpoints. Funny- I never understood or agreed with the anti-vax idea until the COVID vaccines arrived.</p>

        <p>The fact that your comment is still up and you haven't been downvoted to hell should tell you everything you need to know. We welcome open discussion if it is done in good faith and based on fact and logic. You can doubt whatever "narrative" you perceive we are pushing here, yet we will not silence you.</p>
<p>On the contrary, go to one of the pro-vaccine subs and say "I'm worried about long term side effects from this experimental drug" (a very reasonable concern) and watch just how fast they ban you for "hate speech" and mods and superusers send you death threats- I'm speaking from firsthand experience.</p>
