    <strong>The end game, part 2: Transhumanism</strong>
    <p><p>This is a continuation of where we left things off in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/j8i899/the_end_game_capturing_and_controlling_human/">part 1</a>.</p>
<p>Today I'm gonna cover the role of transhumanism, an initiative that has been entrusted to Elon Musk, just as corona scam has been Bill Gates' responsibility and creating social unrest is George Soros' game.</p>
<p>The goal of transhumanism is to blend man with machine. Elon Musk <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/elon-musk-demonstrates-brain-computer-tech-neuralink-in-live-pigs.html">recently demonstrated</a> a pig who had a direct brain connection to a computer. If you think Gates' plan of microchipping you is sinister, you really need to get up to speed with what our Elon has in store for you.</p>
<p>My guess is, within 5 years (by which time we'll have the dystopian one-world communist technocracy firmly in place), it'll be common to see people who have been "augmented". Initially there will be no shortage of excited fanbois and fangirls wetting themselves to feel special and get their implants. Very soon this will become widespread and then all white collar workers will be under great pressure to "convert".</p>
<p>If you are an accountant, you'll have to compete with augmented accountants who have the entire tax law downloaded and regularly updated in their brain. If you are a student, you'll compete with other students who have all coursebooks in their brain. Same if you are a programmer, a teacher, a translator, an interpreter. Think competing with Neo in The Matrix after he downloads and "learns" all those skills.</p>
<p>Within 10 years, I predict we'll see job adverts saying "non-augmented need not apply".</p>
<p>All this, to capture and tamper with the human consciousness, to control you completely and to end free will. If they have managed to get a chip in your head, they've got you.</p>
<p>The "why" question is beyond the scope of this short post, and you are not gonna believe me anyway, so I won't bother.</p>
<p>It's fine that the vast majority of you won't believe me. The fact that you are on this subreddit means you're on the right path and you're already way ahead of the other 99%. Some of us are just a little ahead of you, because we started before you. You'll get there eventually.</p>
<p>If nothing else, remember in 10 year's time that I told you so.</p></p>

        <p>I think it’s important for people who don’t have any desire to participate in this kind of thing to band together and resist it. They can effectively remove people from society by not allowing them to work, but they cannot keep a decent sized group of people from forming their own society. </p>
<p>This new society likely wouldn’t have most of the amenities we are used to, but if that is the alternative to what is coming down the pipes I would be ok with that. I’m sure others would be too. If you have enough people who know how to build rudimentary housing, grow/raise/hunt food, make clothing and blankets, and have a basic understanding of rudimentary medical care, that group of people can accept an outdated way of life in order to separate themselves from this kind of madness. </p>
<p>I know a group of people who have these skills and we’ve decided to come together and make our own path in the event that something like this should ever happen. Imagine many similar groups being formed and coming together. We need a way to connect everyone who wants to resist things like this once they become a problem. </p>
<p>Too much technology will eventually destroy a society, as it has many times throughout history if you look at all the advanced ancient civilizations that have disappeared. There is a balance and a limit that needs to be respected. It is human nature to always push past that limit for profit and power, but groups of people have always come together to resist and they are the ones that come out on the other side.</p>

        <p>This is where faith should be explored. For me, it's not churchianity, but having a personal relationship with Jesus. I fully believe that these are the end times as all of this is playing out exactly as the book of revelations has described 2000 years ago. I'm not trying to preach to anyone, but I don't think we're going to get through this without some kind of faith in something much higher and greater than ourselves.</p>

        <p>A big part of it is keeping the illusion of diversity and separation. If it all seemed like it was completely uniform the grand illusion wouldn’t be as effective. Most of the stuff that comes out to the public about these people are scripts that are written to feed into whatever narrative they are trying to spin.</p>
