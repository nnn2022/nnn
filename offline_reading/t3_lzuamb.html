    <strong>A Couple Questions For The Lurking Doomers</strong>
    <p><ol>
<li>
<p>How long are you willing to mask up and lockdown for? This could go on for YEARS if the people in charge want it to. New year, new variant. Are you really willing to sacrifice the best years of your life to protect people you purport to hate (boomers) from a virus with a 99.7% survival rate?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the pandemic is as deadly as you say it is, how come no one (as far as I'm aware) on this subreddit is changing sides or dying? You'd figure there'd be some posts along the lines of:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I Used To Be A NoNewNormal Member, But Then My Entire Family Died From Covid, Now I Stay Home And Wear A Mask To Bed!</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p>This Is u/EatShitDoomer's Wife, I Have Sad News Regarding My Husband. He Died On The Toilet From Covid Whilst In The Middle Of Composing Another NoNewNormal Post.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How many masks are you willing to wear at any given time? The Science currently recommends two or three. If they decide to up this number to five or ten even, will you comply? If not, why are you so fucking selfish?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why is it okay for people to die from lockdown-related starvation and suicide, vaccine side effects, or any preexisting condition that couldn't be treated due to Covid restrictions, yet if 86 year old Edith with a compromised immune system and a gammy leg dies WITH Covid that's beyond the pale and we need to shut down society forever?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do you fucking sleep at night?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What wouldn't you do or give up in the name of Covid? If the government informed you that in order to combat the spread of Covid, sex was no longer allowed, would you acquiesce? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If people "mostly peacefully protesting" in the name of BLM is perfectly fine, why the fuck can't I sit on a park bench without being asked to move along?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You never had a life or identity before Covid did you? That's why you want this to continue, so you can virtue-signal for internet points and indulge your social anxiety by avoiding your family and friends for the rest of your life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If hospitals are so overwhelmed, how come doctors and nurses are frequently posting Tik-Tok dance videos in empty hospital hallways? Even if they're not on Covid wards, surely they must be aware on some level that people fucking hate it and they're just doing more harm than good? How can you defend them when their videos are (perhaps unintentionally) creating further distrust in the medical profession and further disbelief in the virus?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You realize telling people to go kill themselves, praying that Texas and other reopened states see a huge spike in deaths, and creating fake accounts to impersonate us and spread hate whilst preaching about how "iF iT jUsT sAvEs oNe LiFe" is fucking morally repugnant, right? You realize that makes you the bad guys, surely? Somehow I doubt it.</p>
</li>

        <p>A lot of your arguments here assume  doomers operate in good faith and actually mean the things they say.</p>
<p>Generally. Itâ€™s all lies (or disgustingly disingenuous) to achieve their goals.</p>
