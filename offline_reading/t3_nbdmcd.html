    <strong>History Will Vindicate Us</strong>
    <p><p>After all, the majority (if not all) of our "conspiracy theories" have come true. We've been ten steps ahead of the doomers this entire time. We called <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-57070185?at_custom3=%40BBCPolitics&amp;at_custom2=twitter&amp;at_medium=custom7&amp;at_campaign=64&amp;at_custom1=[post%20type]&amp;at_custom4=twitter&amp;fbclid=IwAR03VxrB68hP_enX-7droKytywmf14JTuaOj5g5-TS0wIXXOAB3e42P_5Fc">vaccine passports.</a> We called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=No5Bz2eHNtA">microchips.</a> We called that "twO wEeKs To fLaTtEn dA cUrVe" wouldn't be two weeks. We called <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article251286824.html">face-masks becoming normalized.</a> We were scoffed at and ridiculed for being "conspiracy theorist nutjobs" by people who are now turning around and claiming these things are "cOmMoN SeNsE" and that "iT wAs aLwAyS gOinG tO bE tHiS wAy!"</p>
<p>If you are on here with the express purpose of downvoting and spreading hate YOU are the problem. You are the villain and grandma killer. You locked gran up for a fucking year and left her rotting in a nursing home. That's elder abuse in my opinion. What a fucking way to spend your twilight years.</p>
<p>You are in support of: destroying the economy, children's education and everyone's mental health. You are in favour of: segregation, fascism and forced masking and vaccination. How can you not see that you're in the wrong here? For fucks sake, grow a pair and fucking take your life into your own hands instead of letting the government dictate it and tell you when <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-57059196">you're allowed to HUG someone.</a> How fucking patronizing!</p>
<p>This shit won't end unless we make it end. We are fighting for freedom, equality, bodily autonomy, basic human rights, and normality. We are fighting against censorship, medical tyranny, totalitarian police states, the further erosion of our rights and freedoms, and the shitty "New Normal" you creeps love so fucking much.</p>
<p>History will vindicate us. This woke insanity is the real pandemic.</p></p>

        <p>Just going to eat at restaurant is a demonstration of how silly the mask stuff is.</p>
<p>Have it on to sit down, take it back off to eat/drink and then slap it back on when you need to go to the bathroom so I can touch my face with my unwashed hands only to repeat the whole insane dog and pony show to finish eating again and wrap up to be "safe" to exit the restaurant.</p>
<p>I thought something cultish and silly was only the work of some kind of sci-fi dystopia yet here we are.</p>
<p>The only way this could make sense if those in charge came out and finally explained this was all just a drill because there will be a real pandemic coming soon.</p>
<p>At this point we are either heading further down the road of insanity or the more likely scenario where a couple years from now we will have the necessary distance to see how stupid and weird this all got just like how it was with the Y2K hysteria.</p>

        <p>Last weekend my area went back to full capacity in the restaurants.  Me and the wife went out to to eat at a local steak house.  I didn’t wear a mask.  I just wanted to see what would happen if I blatantly did not care about their “mask rules”. </p>
<p>When we got there it was around a 45 minute wait for a table because everybody in the whole city went out to experience the max capacity restaurants again.  It started out as me being the only person in the waiting area not wearing one.  Nobody said a thing to me,  not even the employees.  After like 5 minutes of me standing there others started taking their mask off.  Not everybody,  but like 7 other people decided not to wear one.  </p>
<p>It was really nice to see people just take them off and be normal again.   Refusing to participate in the charade of mask wear is all you have to do to stop the lockdown and tyranny.</p>

        <p>Restaurants also point out the insanity of wearing a mask outdoors.</p>
<p>Here in New York our streets are blocked up with outdoor seating because you can’t eat indoors because “muh improper ventilation”. Ok, bet. So if there isn’t proper ventilation to be safe indoors, why the FUCK does anyone need a mask at any time outside? They are in the best ventilated space - outside</p>

        <p>I’ve said it once, and I’ll say it again. Our generation is far worse than the boomer generation could ever dream of being. We have single handily fist fucked into oblivion any glimpse of liberty that was left for our kids to enjoy. Look at our track record for Christ’s sake. Sympathizers for corrupt government, allowing lockdowns that ruined people’s livelihoods, re-segregation of the population, living and dying by propaganda flowing from most media outlets, publicly ridiculing people for choosing not to wear masks when they’re not even fucking sick, our music is absolute garbage, our movies suck, people calling us science deniers while at the same time claiming there is more than two genders.....that’s just scratching the surface. At this point, I wouldn’t be surprised if the human race has only another century or so left to occupy this planet. As George Carlin said. “The people are fucked.”</p>

        <p>Be that as it may, and you’re 100% correct. They’re not the ones striking peoples YouTube channels, banning people from social media for saying things they don’t agree with. Mostly what we have left are mindless drones licking the boots of corrupt boomer politicians. That’s worse as far as I’m concerned, because that makes our generation enablers who will eventually be the same if not worse when the power falls into our hands.</p>

        <p>Its creeping normality with a twist. They flip flop on changes and introduce a lot of noise but the end result is the same. People who told you that you're crazy last year now forgot how they felt at that time and have already embraced their new reality, despite all your warnings coming true. They won't question themselves. The dissonance is hard to overcome. Most people won't even realise they changed positions radically, even if you point it out to them.</p>
<p>&rt; Creeping normality is a process by which a major change can be accepted as normal and acceptable if it happens slowly through small, often unnoticeable, increments of change. The change could otherwise be regarded as remarkable and objectionable if it took place in a single step or short period.</p>

        <p>I think the ruling elite have to go for broke now because they can only hold off the looming economic crisis for so long. </p>
<p>If you want another conspiracy theory that is coming true have a look at central bank digital currencies, I.e. programmable money. This has been talked about widely in the (true) cryptocurrency ecosystem for 18 or so months now but was palmed off as a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>This will mean that central authorities (E.g. the government) will be able to dictate how, when and where you spend your money or whether you even deserve to have money (let's say if you decide you would prefer not to be vaccinated).</p>
<p>Don't believe this is happening? China has introduced adnd even airdropped their new <a href="https://theconversation.com/chinas-digital-currency-could-be-the-future-of-money-but-does-it-threaten-global-stability-160560">digital yuan</a>, linked to your social score and programmed to only be spendable during a particular window, while some European countries such as Sweden have been actively researching their own.</p>

        <p>History will not vindicate us. History will say</p>
<p>“in a time of uncertainty the people of the world worked together to combat not only a deadly global pandemic, but racial injustice at the same time. This was the generation of heroes who fought fake news conspiracy theorists, nazis and overthrew a fascist government and let democracy shine once again “ </p>
<p>Don’t you get it? They control all forms of media. They burn the records showing any opposition to their “perfect ideology.“ They are wholly convinced that their actions are “on the right side of history “ (fuck you Obama for making that designation official). Nothing we do now will vindicate us unless we take the ENTIRE world back to pre 2014 because unfortunately this entire world has succumb to live under Khmer Rouge like communist doctrine.</p>
