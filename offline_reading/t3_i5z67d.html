        <p>It takes a special kind of mindset to think actions that protect fellow citizens would be considered planned oppression or some sort of “psyops”. Lockdowns sucked. Masks suck.  Not being able to do normal things sucks. But we are in a pandemic. That’s the reality. We have to deal with it for the good of society. I don’t see how this is lost on this sub.</p>

        <p>Good to know that they only thing standing between us and having this grand conspiracy spelled out is a some writing time from a redditor.  Ok.</p>
<p>I've been reading this  sub for  the past few weeks and I can summarize in two words:  entitled and selfish.   I'm not some MSNBC drone that wants to lock down everything.   I want the economy back too.  But we should do  it safely and in a way that minimizes deaths.   200K is a lot deaths (check the CDC report out today) no matter how you cut it.  Are people that want this sheep as this sub would characterize?</p>

        <p>200K deaths this year due to COVID and yet in the US we average 3 million plus due to various causes. 500K due to misdiagnosis and mis prescribed drugs alone yearly and you didn't ask to revoke the license of the doctors that participated. Based on these numbers your perception and grasp of reality is clearly skewed, and it is even worse that you cannot self reflect and see that on your own. No we have to point that out and even then armed with those facts you will continue to advocate policies that contribute mass harm. I hope you're proud of yourself. Your so called "concern" for us all is actually harming everyone including yourself...time to wake up. You better do it on your own because if reality does it you will not be gently woken you will be metaphorically tossed out of bed and kicked in the face.</p>

        <p>Other numbers for context:</p>
<p><em>CDC estimates that</em> <strong><em>influenza</em></strong> <em>has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000</em> <strong><em>deaths</em></strong> <em>annually since 2010.</em></p>
<p><em>National Institutes of Health, obesity and overweight together are the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, close behind tobacco use (3).

        <p>Fair. I appreciate you being reasonable.</p>
<p>I hate that people are dying from COVID - but as I said in the other comment to you, people die every year from a lot of things (including the flu and other viruses/diseases). Obesity causes more deaths than COVID. Cigarette smoking causes more than double the deaths of COVID. Flu causes roughly one-third the deaths of COVID (that's a hell of a lot). We don't lockdown or wear masks or anything else over those things.</p>
<p>So why COVID?</p>

        <p>While we're throwing around numbers:</p>
<p><em>CDC estimates that</em> <strong><em>influenza</em></strong> <em>has resulted in between 9 million – 45 million illnesses, between 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations and between 12,000 – 61,000</em> <strong><em>deaths</em></strong> <em>annually since 2010.</em></p>
<p>Do you care about the flu? 61,000 is a hell of a lot of deaths - almost one-third the COVID deaths. So shouldn't you care 1/3rd as much as you do about COVID?</p>
<p><em>National Institutes of Health, obesity and overweight together are the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, close behind tobacco use (3). An estimated</em> <strong><em>300,000</em></strong> <em>deaths per year are due to the obesity epidemic (</em><strong><em>57</em></strong><em>).</em></p>
<p>300,000 deaths per year due to obesity. So shouldn't you care about obesity MORE than you care about COVID? At least 50% MORE?</p>
<p><em>Cigarette</em> <strong><em>smoking</em></strong> <em>is responsible for more than 480,000</em> <strong><em>deaths</em></strong> <em>per year in the</em> <strong><em>United States</em></strong>*, including more than 41,000* <strong><em>deaths</em></strong> <em>resulting from secondhand smoke exposure.</em></p>
<p>Cigarettes cause FAR MORE deaths than COVID - including 41000 <strong>innocent people</strong> who die from second-hand smoke. So shouldn't you care about cigarette smoking at least twice as much as you care about COVID?</p>
<p>You need to face the fact <strong>you only care about COVID because it's trendy right now</strong>; not because you actually give a shit about people dying.</p>

        <p>The flu has a very low death rate. Covid is ~8 x deadlier. And more infectious. Hence the pandemic and global disruption.</p>

        <p>I agree with you that COVID is deadlier - my argument is have the lockdowns/masks/etc been an overreaction compared to the actual threat level? I think we've gone <strong>way</strong> over the top and massively overreacted. And in doing so we haven't actually protected the vulnerable and the elderly, because we've been so caught up in masks vs no masks, locking down <em>everybody</em>, etc.</p>
<p>Especially when we didn't lock down with Ebola, or Swine Flu, or Spanish Flu, etc etc - all of which had a higher death rate than COVID.</p>

        <p>Well first off before you accuse me of making up bullshit statistics upon examining your source COVID isn't in the top 3 because these stats are from 2017. I was mistaken the number of deaths due to medical errors is actually around 250,000 according to John Hopkins which is the actual 3rd leading cause of death NOT COVID. </p>

        <p>Dude your article is from 2016. You should probably read the link thoroughly before posting.</p>
<p>Edit. And even if those numbers are true today, they said 250k not 500k like you stated. And on top of that it would still make COVID the number 4 killer.  If we totally ignored it, it would easily be the number one killer. Is that okay with you?  Is that what you want?  For us to do nothing?</p>

        <p>Yes I realize that and I also addressed that I was wrong initially due to the fact that I was going off the top of my head. However I was talking about averages and that stat still stands today. The difference is you were specifically talking about COVID and the link you gave made no mention of COVID because of the year it highlighted. </p>
<p>Interestingly researchers in Spain found COVID in sewage as early as March 2019 in frozen samples and guess what? No lock down then. People were dying just as much if not more than now, and did you care? I'm almost sure the answer is no. Link provided below.</p>

        <p>Noted that you explained the 500k previously. </p>
<p>“People we’re dying just as much”. Do you have evidence to back this claim?  I would assume we could look at the YOY deaths to see if there were spikes in March 2019 in Spain. </p>
<p>I agree with you guys that the media hyped this up to no end and it’s disgusting. But our health officials are the ones making these decisions about the pandemic (when republicans let them) It’s their job. It’s what they get paid to do. Why do you know better than them from a public health policy perspective?  You realize that there were anti maskers in 1918?  History hasn’t looked too kindly on them.</p>

        <p>And despite that people were wearing mask back then the Spanish flu, (Which actually originated in Kansas) still ravaged the world. History never mentioned mask until COVID came about so mentioning anti-maskers in that context is irrelevant. As far as evidence that people were dying I seriously shouldn't have to reference any stat regarding death because well....people die....all the time and have been dying since man was born, smh. Jesus Christ. You want evidence go to a grave yard, sheesh. This is how obtuse people have gotten in the last couple of months you cannot prevent people from dying. Look at the lock down in Melbourne. They locked down completely and still 17 people died. Of the 17 two males in their 50's, four males in their 70's, four females and two males in their 80's two males and three females in their 90's. This is pretty standard stuff not to mention this happened DESPITE the fact that they locked down. No mention if these people had comorbidities but if that is the case than this is a travesty because they're imprisoning the healthy for people who in all likelihood are going to die regardless of what you do. Blaming any partisan side for this is absolutely absurd since both are equally corrupt.</p>

<p>You realize that most every country tracks deaths?  And we can compare averages?  That's how we know that there were 200K excess deaths in  the US this year.</p>
<p>You made a claim that just as many people were dying in Spain in March 2019.  You offer no evidence to the claim, presumably made to support the argument that we don't need lock downs.  And when asked for evidence you offer me to look at graveyards.  No offense, but that is an intellectually  weak argument.</p>

        <p>The irony here is that you could use your original link for the stats you're requesting. If that isn't being intellectually lazy I don't know what is, lol. Funny you pointing out 200,000 excess deaths but interestingly infant mortality has dropped significantly this year. One could associate that with the reduction in doctor's visits since COVID had taken priority, of course that in itself would be jumping to conclusions since correlation isn't causation. I am also hesitant of even including deaths attributed to COVID since they've admitted that they are including people who died WITH covid along with people who died OF covid. Even Texas health services had to, albeit quietly, remove 3000 plus cases from their stats due to improper testing methods and contaminated test kits which puts damn near everything in doubt regarding this so called "pandemic". Also since google has flooded its search engine with COVID information it is becoming increasingly difficult to find statistics regarding anything else health related which should be a red flag to anyone trying to do honest research regarding the matter.</p>

<p>I agree that there is some miscounting but we are missing deaths. The confirmed deaths are 160k.  Excess deaths are 200k. I will admit that the excess deaths could include other reason caused by lockdowns. Let’s say it’s 10%. That still leaves 180k dead in 6 months. </p>

        <p>Well my whole point is this isn't a pandemic. 160 plus deaths is not abnormal for any year and not for any infection especially when the majority of the deaths are of people who are elderly and with comorbidities. Tuberculosis killed far more people recently in a shorter period of time than COVID and again no lock down. 1.5 million people died of it just last year and again no lockdown and it is a far more contagious and deadly of a disease than COVID. I do want things to return as it was in February, no question. You have no idea the draconian measures they are rolling out for something that has a 99% survival rate otherwise your position would be opposite of what it is.</p>

        <p>Well the Trump administration in essence did nothing for 3 months longer than any other country and we still only have 160k deaths so no your wrong about that, not to mention other states opened up and we still haven't had the catastrophic effect you speak of. Neil Ferguson predicted 2.2 million deaths and that prediction was woefully short. What you are saying is clearly irrational since it does not match up with our present situation. Those who are calling it a pandemic are liars and fear mongers and are contrarian when you look at their previous statements in the past in comparison to the present. Fauci said we didn't need mask and that though they may make us feel better they essentially do nothing. He has don a complete 180 on the subject and therefor cannot be trusted especially since he doesn't follow his own recommendations regarding "social distancing" (which is an oxymoron BTW) and proper mask usage. See his Nationals game attendance for reference.</p>

        <p>"A pandemic is defined as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people”. The classical definition includes nothing about population immunity, virology or disease severity."  </p>
<p>At this moment there are 732k deaths world wide out of a world population of just under 8 billion. That is in the zero percentile. These deaths are under 1 million not to mention the majority of these people were elderly and or had comorbidities yet here you are claiming over a million people would die if we do nothing. That is an assumption and a wild one at that and not based on any science whatsoever. All predictive models were wildly inaccurate and billions of lives were destroyed in the process. Suicides have skyrocketed and are on their way to surpassing COVID deaths if these lockdowns continue. Sweden did very little and have a lower mortality rate than most countries with extreme lockdown  measures. Another real world example that destroys your assumption. As for asking for my credentials on the matter, that is irrelevant and is akin to asking for my Astronomy degree just because I claim the sun rises in the east based on my repeated observations of it doing so. By all means keep listening to professional liars and running around in hysterics, lol.</p>

        <p>Well please tell me what these people got right? I have no interest in how you're doing financially. I also find it interesting that initially you appeared to show general concern for people and now in light of the facts I presented, at your request mind you, your tone changes to condescension and is a tad bit braggadocious but whatever, lol. As if I could even verify your claims of wealth I seriously don't see the purposes of sharing something that personal.</p>

Also, I have been nothing but civil but your last post is uncivil due to you calling me a dick.

        <p>I think that was a matter of personal interpretation and considering the claim you made that a million people would die if we did nothing yet we have yet to eclipse a million deaths worldwide at this point seems inline with my statement. Also my comment is no where near the level of disrespect you had shown. I also think you did mean to call me a dick but upon reflection you deleted your comment. I would prefer an apology rather than you delete the comment. Telling me you didn't mean to call me a dick is not an apology. I don't care either way do you.</p>

        <p>This study didn't conclusively say so. When you actually read the article a couple of words jump out, words like "suggest" and " may" and " likely".  The real kicker is the Dr. they interviewed who said, " We can speculate all day about this, but we just don’t know,” Dr. Osterholm said. “The bottom line message is: There’s going to be transmission.”  Well duh, of course there's going to be transmission but the fact that he admitted that HE DOESN'T KNOW is why I cannot trust anything these people say.</p>

<p>Stop pretending you actually care about your fellow citizens. Maybe you care about yourself and your loved ones, but claiming to genuinely care about thousands, millions, billions of people is little more than vapid self-righteousness. We care about those we are close to, anything beyond that is shallow and hollow.</p>

        <p>Yes going to be interesting to see how large-scale censorship plays out in the digital age. Hopefully we have the savvy to keep speaking our truths whatever. To find one other, debate, share info and meet.</p>

        <p>Went out to a bar tonight (first time going to a bar outside of mealtime since covid lockdowns hit) and nobody, including bartenders, were wearing masks or distancing or anything. This is in a state with a mask mandate as well. Just because reddit has a certain opinion doesn’t mean that most Americans are bootlicking the lockdown propaganda.</p>
