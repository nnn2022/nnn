        <p>This and the other post today nailed it. If you need a test and then wait 48 hours just to know if you even have it..it’s not something that needs a vaccine.</p>

        <p>This, and cyber attacks. I shouldn't have to be reminded about it through mandatory training at work if it's really such a big problem. And if I get hacked I have to wait days or weeks just know if my identity is stolen. That's not something that needs all these darn email filters.</p>

        <p>How can I be more clear?  If it’s so deadly why do people get a test and no answers for 48 hours so they still work or go into public .. why? If it’s so serious like say leprosy.. don’t you know you have it?</p>

        <p>You mean like hiv/aids? Where symptoms are hidden yet transmissible for years? The deadly virus that even after 40 years of research, modern tests can't detect it for up to six months?</p>
<p>If you suspect you have a disease, enough where you get a test for it, the responsible thing to do is avoid potentially transmitting it to others until the test results come in. </p>
<p>If you think you have hiv, you should get tested, and until you know for sure, not have unprotected sex or share needles.</p>
<p>If you suspect you have covid you shoukd get tested, which can get results in 10 minutes for a quick test (that can produce false positives, but not false negatives) or 2 days for a longer, more accurate test. While waiting for results, avoid contact with other people. </p>
<p>This is not rocket science. If you don't know, take preventative measures to make sure others are safe around you if the test comes back positive.</p>

We have wasted things we built over a lie. My parents took the shot but despite that .. I know 2022 is gonna be a big year for me laughing at those who took it. Event 201 hasn’t changed course from reality so that means a lot of you fuckers die from the vax.</p>

        <p>Are we talking about the same common sense that says "Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it can't kill you"?</p>
<p>HIV/Aids is a virus that we've been researching for over 40 years. Even after decades of research, it can take up to 6 months after being infected before a test will register the presence of the virus, even with modern tests. You are walking around with a virus that will kill you, able to transmit it to others, without presenting symptoms.</p>
<p>How does it make ANY sense to say "If you need to test to see if you have it, it's not dangerous"</p>
<p>Or did they mean something else?</p>

        <p>I hate to sound pompous when I say this but I 100% agree. Why tell healthy people who aren’t at risk to stay home and mask up when we should be compiling who’s at risk and who isn’t, and telling them to stay home and utilize all these delivery services that have popped up since Covid hit.</p>

        <p>He did everything he could to protect himself. He lived in a retirement home and one of the workers got it and passed it because the worker had no symptoms. It was before the mask requirements. The point is, even if you think you're healthy and don't have it, you can still pass it on to other people. So why be selfish? Why not do what you can to help your fellow people? Why risk killing other people? I know 3 people in their 40s that died, they believed they were healthy, one of them ran marathons. So it doesn't only kill unhealthy people.</p>

        <p>So he was already in what should be a protected environment, and yet he still got sick.  Darn about that, but frankly it just happens.  You didn't mention his age, only that his heart was sub-par.  A number of other things could have taken him out too.</p>
<p>As for you knowing 3 people in their 40s who died..... you didn't say from what.  If you are going to say that they died from C-19, then I am going to call you a liar.  It's just so unlikely.  I'm sure there have been a few otherwise healthy people in that age range who died from C-19, just like as happens with other illnesses including influenza, but it's anecdotal.  If you want me to believe Covid is a serious threat to that category of people you would need to provide substantial evidence of it, but you cannot because there isn't.  Just you saying you know 3 people ....etc........ doesn't mean anything.</p>
<p>Finally, fuck you for implying that people who want to live their ordinary lives are being selfish.  You take care of you, and never mind what the rest of us do.  <strong>You</strong> are the one who is selfish in that regard.</p>

        <p>Yo, can you explain how this person's grandfather is somehow excluded from your group of people who want to live their ordinary life? Like, what's the difference between him and you, wanting to go about their normal lives without dying?</p>
<p>How do you square the 2 thoughts: "I want to go about my life normally" and "Your grandfather should have put his normal life on hold to avoid contact with people like me"</p>
<p>You're getting called out for a selfish mentality, because WE ALL WANT to live our lives normally, but most of us are ready to scale back social interaction, wear a mask, and wash our hands, because we know that if we don't, we might accidentally kill someone.</p>
<p>Others, like you, are not willing to make that trade off. That's already pretty selfish.</p>
<p>To compound the issue, and what makes you even more selfish, is that we can all go back to normal, LIKE WE ALL WANT, if people would simply take necessary precautions for a short time. By ignoring these precautions early on, the virus was allowed to spread, prolonging the period of time that we all need to suffer. Your own actions are what is making things worse for yourself, and everyone else, and you're blaming it on other people. That's fucking selfish as hell.</p>

        <p>The thing is, YOU are the one taking the actions that make the situation dangerous for others.</p>
<p>Pretend like instead of a virus, its radiation we're dealing with.</p>
<p>You happen to be resistant to radiation (you have a strong immune system), but you are a danger to anyone WITHOUT radiation resistance. The fact that you know this, and you're OK with it, makes that decision super fucking selfish.</p>
<p>By going out in public, carrying around the radiation to anyone you bump in to, you are FORCING everyone without your resistance to stay away from you. Your actions are endangering others, and prolonging the time in which others can't lead a normal life, which is currently possible for you. That's fucking selfish.</p>
<p>Asking you to STOP taking actions that endanger others is not selfish, it's simple empathy. Please stop wildly swinging swords around. Please stop pouring gasoline near the fire. Please stop throwing rocks over the cliff, there are hikers down there. Other people are affected by your actions.</p>
<p>If the only danger was to yourself, nobody would be asking you to do anything. The problem is that you're endangering others, and forcing them to respond to your actions.</p>
<p>YOU are doing precisely the thing that you don't want to have done to you. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.</p>

        <p>So I'm to <em>pretend</em> that it's worse than it is now?  Dude, we've had this virus for over a year and 99.96% of us have survived it.  So let's pretend we're all just wildly swinging swords around and pouring gasoline on fires?</p>
<p>The overreaction to this mild virus <em>has</em> caused people to lose their livelihoods, <em>has</em> caused people to turn to substance abuse, <em>has</em> led to higher suicide rates, <em>has</em> led to more domestic violence, <em>has</em> led to other diseases being under diagnosed ..... etc.  By supporting the overreaction which has led to all of these things makes you an incredibly selfish person.  Try to show some empathy once in a while.</p>

        <p>Yeah, fuck me for wanting to save lives. So selfish of me. Because of people like you, others are now suffering way more. </p>
<p>And yes, I did know them and yes they did die from Covid 19. One of them was just like you, believed he was invisible and that the virus wouldn't affect him. Now there's 2 kids under 13 with no father. </p>
<p>You can call me a liar, I have nothing to gain from it. I don't even live in the same country as you. I'm just letting you know so that you can be informed. Because a lot of people here are in a bubble and don't necessarily see what's happening outside of it.</p>
<p>And let's be honest, even if I post links to news articles about healthy people being affected, you'll say it's fake news.</p>

        <p>I looked at your first link, and I can see why it frightened you.  Phrases like "jumped by 10 per cent" are <em>meant</em> to frighten you.  ICU is 90% full?..... what is it usually, article doesn't say.  They're "between 30 and 65 years old.......overweight......some of them have diabetes...." .. all right, how many young healthy adults have died from C-19..... article doesn't say.  Again, sometimes younger people get sick, they always have and always will.  If you want to present a case to me I need better numbers than "These are people who still had 30 or 40 years to live."  How many people again.......oh, it's just "<strong>these</strong>" people.  I need numbers like this:  we've had this virus for over a year now and 99.96% of us have survived it.</p>
<p>Try to read critically.  Try to not let the tone of an article sway your viewpoint.  Articles are written to be read, so they always have an agenda.  Data is what counts, and it needs to be in context.  Just saying that the ICU is 90% full is meaningless without context, for example.</p>

        <p>I honestly don't need the articles. I know people in real life that died. Like I said, doesn't matter what I send, you choose what you want to believe. You won't get it until someone you love suddenly dies from it. I don't mind small inconveniences if it means potentially saving someone else from going through what I did. Governments do make me sick with the way they're handling things, putting their own profits before peoples health, but nothing I can do about that, so I just do what I can.</p>

        <p>Someone I love <em>did</em> die, my mother, in a nursing home with dementia.  Because of the over zealous restrictions we were not allowed to visit her.  We were told that she had lucid moments every day, so I can't help but think she wondered where her family was.  We tried the Zoom thing, and visiting through a window, but I'm afraid those things only confused her more.  But you probably don't care about that, because she didn't die from Covid-19, and people like you seem to think that's the <em>only</em> kind of death that matters anymore.  That's what <strong>you</strong> choose to believe.  And the reason you don't "need the articles" is because they don't lend credence to your position.  I very quickly and easily showed you the errors of the first one you sent, I don't think I need to bother reading the others after that.</p>
<p>I really <em>do</em> wish you'd read things critically though.  And that doesn't mean to 'criticize', it just means to watch out for things like why the author wrote what he did.  For example, in that article, instead of the author writing "jumped by 10 per cent", he could have written "a 10 per cent increase", or even "we noticed a slight 10 per cent increase"... stuff like that.  That article is <em>designed</em> to grab your attention, and in this case with a fear angle.  People <em>do</em> love to be afraid of something.</p>
<p>You know people in real life that died:  unfortunately we all do.  If in fact you happen to know people who died from C-19 then you know more than anyone I know who does.  I mean, I don't know anyone who knows anyone who died from C-19.  To be blunt, your anecdotal experience doesn't change the fact that after over a year of this 99.96% of us have survived it.  .04 per cent died.  Far more than that have suffered in many ways unrelated to being sick from this virus...... losing one's livelihood is <strong>not</strong> a small inconvenience, nor is encouraging cancer screenings to lapse, nor is the depression that comes about when people are no longer allowed to go to church, or gather with their families, or play in the park.... on and on, and all of those things happened.  Teaching toddlers to look with suspicion at people who don't wear a mask, or even don't wear one 'properly' is not a small inconvenience, let alone the wearing of a mask at all.  <em>I</em> have trouble breathing with one on, so do lots of people.  It doesn't matter if <em>you</em> don't, plenty of people do.  It's not a small inconvenience when domestic violence increases, and alcoholism, and hungry children of whom many relied on their school lunches as their most nutritious meal of the day.</p>
<p>The whole world has been turned upside down because of a virus with a miniscule mortality rate, and doing so has wreaked all kinds of problems.  But you don't seem to mind any of that, and nothing I can say will change your mind.  I just wish you'd show some compassion once in a while.</p>

        <p>Vaccines drastically reduce the severity of the symptoms in those vaccinated, and the probability of infecting others. That's the main reason for all vaccination.
When exposed to a virus you have been vaccinated against, it's not a guarantee of safety, but it is a massive reduction in risk, for yourself, and others. </p>

        <p>Sure, this is pretty basic immune system stuff.</p>
<p>Here's a video that explains it well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQGOcOUBi6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQGOcOUBi6s</a></p>
<p>If you can't spare 6 minutes:</p>
<p>When your immune system fights off an infection, it creates memory cells, that are particularly sensitive to the infection that sparked the illness. If that infection starts again, these memory cells immediately launch into high gear, producing antibodies that are pre-configured to be very effective at slowing and disabling the infectious particles (virus, or bacteria). If you have NOT had the infection before, it normally takes the immune system much longer to create and deploy effective antibodies.</p>
<p>When you caught covid the first time, your immune system took the long route to create these antibodies. Your body fought it off, and created memory cells. Any further infection was handled my memory cells, that rapidly deployed effective antibodies, stopping the infection from spreading to the point where it is noticeable.</p>
<p>Vaccines use this exact same mechanism. There are many types of vaccine, but all of them expose your immune system to a version of the virus that it can rapidly defeat, without causing an actual infection. Your immune system can't tell the difference between the real live virus particles and the inert vaccine component particles, and ramps up full defenses. This is why you get body aches, swelling at the injection site, and maybe even a fever for a day after a vaccine. Your body is responding to what it thinks is a real threat, but it's a one sided war. After your body fights off the phantom infection, it creates memory cells as if it had fought off the real infection.</p>
<p>This is the reason why one household doesn't stay sick forever with the same cold virus. Once you develop antibodies that are effective against it, the next time you are exposed to it by another person in the house, your immune system kicks it's ass before you even notice.</p>
<p>The problem is, that virus and bacteria infections create mutations, like all other living cells that duplicate themselves. Viruses mutate a little bit each time they infect a new person. This is why the common cold virus always comes back. It infects so many people that its always mutating into something your body no longer recognizes with its antibody memory.</p>
<p>This is why its so important to reduce the infection rate of covid. Each new person it infects creates the possibility to have strains that aren't defeated by vacines, or existing natural immunity.</p>

        <p>I hear you, and agree that many on this sub and others lack an understanding of the mechanisms behind vaccines. However, with that in mind, I don’t understand why mask-mandates remain in place where cities have the majority of their population vaccinated. Furthermore, because most of the population the past year hasn’t had symptoms, why the lockdowns if the vaccines are going to make everyone a symptomatic but carriers anyways?</p>
<p>Hope what i’m trying to say makes sense. I really appreciate your initial comment and time to post.</p>

        <p>Masks reduce transmission rates, and the number of virus particles that do get transmitted. The reason to still wear a mask despite a high percent of vaccinated population, is mutations. </p>
<p>There are a already several virus strains that the current set of vaccines are not as effective against. Each person that incubates the virus gives it a chance to mutate again. Reducing the spread of the virus is currently, and should continue to be the most important thing people can do to end the pandemic.</p>

        <p>My grandfather died about 6 years ago. He had Parkinson’s, but what killed him was a mild cold that transformed into pneumonia. He could not survive even a mild infection.</p>
<p>I’m glad he didn’t die a mere prop to scare people about the common cold.</p>

        <p>I recently started listening to the radio and dear god, it is literally every commercial. “We all know that wearing a mask is the best way to slow the pandemic...” “Get the vaccine when it’s your turn”. “Cases are rising and dangerous new variants are being discovered every day”. I don’t watch regular TV and didn’t really listen to the radio until recently. This propaganda is insane!</p>

        <p>I just wish y'all would stop spreading dangerous misinformation so this could be true... But thanks to rabid anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers (like most here in this sub) we kinda still <em>need</em> the ongoing information campaign about the virus.</p>
