        <p>Awesome post.  I think the lock downs made things significantly worse personally.   From exercise, to less vit d, to depression, undiagnosed conditions, and especially economic damage; which will take years to unfold.</p>
<p>We will have higher deaths in the lockdown states, for years to come.</p>

        <p>In addition to the articles premise that being stuck in poorly ventilated areas increases transmission</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>being outside less means less vitamin D production</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Staying home, avoiding human interaction, avoiding the sun, especially during winter, not going to the gym, all has a negative toll on the immune system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloth and paper masks are biological hazards you strap to your face. A petri dish you get to breath. And everyone knows you are not supposed to touch your face to not spread COVID. Everyone who wears a mask for more than a few minutes touches their face all day long, constantly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somehow California, NY, Michigan, New Jersey  and a few other states thought stuffing COVID positive patients into elderly care facilities was a good public health policy. While its pretty close to the premise of the article, the blatant disregard for life and common sense still blows my mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Places that do not have panicked overreaching authoritarian public health policies have less of a population that gets their news from MSNBC or CNN. They will have been allowed to hear that sunlight, vitamin D, regular excercise, a healthy diet, and social interaction all increase your immune systems natural abilities. They will also be allowed to see the difference in case numbers and fatalities between the two modalities and make an easy decision on which one is best</p>
