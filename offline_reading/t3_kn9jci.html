    <strong>I am sick and tired of living in a faceless society.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm am sick and tired of living in a faceless society. I hate that everywhere I go in public, the only thing I see of people are soul-less eyes. Physically, wearing a mask doesn't particularly bother me, it's the fact of seeing everyone else in masks and not being able to see their faces I find just incredibly disturbing. </p>
<p>Doomers love to cite Asia as a mask wearing culture. People wear masks in Asia to signify they are sick. "<em>Stay away from me</em>" It doesn't work when everyone is forced to wear them. <em>This is not normal.</em> I'm simply anxiously awaiting the day when I can see people's faced and communicate effectively in public again. I could almost tolerate everything else about the sheer over-reaction to covid including media hype and public shaming if only masks were completely out of the equation.</p></p>

        <p>anyone else noticed that people dont bother talking to each other anymore? with muffled voices it simply isnt worth it and if people do talk to each other it is merely to echange basic sentences as anything to complex cant be heard.</p>

        <p>I've also noticed that, but it's just a small part of it. Because of the extreme fear of the virus, people avoid gesture and writing too. Many talks with their mouth closed. I've seen some unmasked people in a plexiglass cubicle a few times and they barely moved their mouth - so it wasn't possible to hear what they said or lipread them.</p>

        <p>As one of the few in Los Angeles that don't wear a mask outside, I have noticed more people saying hello to me on the street. This didn't really happen to me before covid and I would say in the last couple months the frequency has increased. I think people are becoming desperate for human interaction. I do my best to give them a big warm smile and say hello back. At this point I am gratefull they are saying hello instead of giving me a dirty look for not wearing a mask. (Although, it's hard for me to tell sometimes if they are giving me a nasty look because half of their face is covered. )</p>

        <p>Yeah, there was one cashier who was trying to tell a funny story about something that happened at the store earlier, but I couldn't catch enough of it to come up with a decent response. Ever since, I have kind of given up on spontaneous conversations in public. I normally love them when they happen. One of the things I miss from before.</p>

        <p>Yes, definitely! I don't wear one unless forced (work and doctor). When forced, I have one that is the absolute bare minimum - clear plastic half circle that attaches under my chin and goes up to the tip of my nose.</p>
<p>I noticed that I get approached <em>constantly</em> no matter where I go. People also make inane jokes a lot more often than they used to. I generally don't like small talk, so I was getting annoyed wondering what I could be doing to attract all this attention (this seriously didn't happen to me before), and then it hit me. You can actually see my face. I look people in the eyes if I approach them or pass by them. Even if I don't smile, you can see some form of acknowledgement on my face. I've seen people reach for a mask or start to pull up a neck gaitor as I approach them, only to stop when I walk by and nod. I'm deeply saddened that just existing as a normal person is rare. Imagine having to go back in time and having to explain something so basic. It's absurd.</p>

        <p>At this point I don’t know if we’ll ever go back to being maskless. All the doomers I know have this mindset of “if we keep wearing masks, then we’ll never have to get sick again!” and it’s disgusting.</p>

        <p>Feminized:
Make (something) more characteristic of women.</p>
<p>The behaviour of these people is completely moronic yes but there is literally no need to put such casual misogyny in there. You are clearly implying that you think submissive idiotic behaviour is somehow a feminine thing and, as such, the men who behave in this way are being ‘feminine’.</p>
<p>Half the people in the world are women. Most of the videos I have seen of people sticking up for themselves without masks in public are women. 
Those in control want us divided and you are adding to the problem. We need every intelligent person we can get so please do not ostracise half the population in one sentence.</p>

        <p>I'm resigned to the fact that they'll be mandated, in some form, for a LONG time to come. I don't see a day anytime soon that an airline says - without public backlash - 'no mask required'. There'll always be one 'special case' demanding masks because they're 'immunocompromised'</p>

        <p>That's the sad fact about all of this. You cannot build a case for masks protecting the wearer against viral infections.</p>
<p>The only plausible case you can build for masking is that it protects everyone else from the wearer if they're contagious. It's very weak but it's way more plausible than protecting the wearer. I absolutely loath that this is the case, but that's where we are.</p>

        <p>Mask culture is largely dependent on your state. I live in the northeast where masks have been mandated since April while the south and Midwest have been much more lenient.  I think eventually you'd start to see a mass exodus from states like mine that continue to require masks to other places.</p>

        <p>I mean that’s why they mandate wearing masks. It dehumanizes people. You see fewer facial expressions and social cues when someone wears a mask. It’s already an us versus them mentality. The elite will tell the sheep to round up those questioning authority. And it’ll be easy because we’re dehumanized</p>

        <p>I'm agree. I feel sick of it too.</p>
<p>Maybe it's anecdotal, but I feel like I forgets some words and some part of spoken language because of that. I still get exposure to faces and spoken language to a few people in my household and on TV, but other than that it's not a lot. I remember the written equivalent to the word, but not the spoken one.</p>

        <p>Related to the "faceless society" part, I know a woman in my small church who is around 60. She was violently raped as a young teenager and her attackers covered her mouth throughout the assault.  Obviously she has PTSD from this. She tried to wear a mask (for the first time in 40+ years) and said it was too triggering, and that she would not be wearing one. We live in Florida, so you would assume the culture in general might be a bit more understanding if she should simply walk into Publix, keep her distance from others, grab maybe 5 - 6 things, and checkout, all in under 10 minutes. Noooooo. She told me some cow on a mobility scooter pulled up next to her in one of the aisles to ask her if she had a mask, and if she didn't, then she should leave the store as she is endangering others. At checkout, she saw someone taking a picture of her. It's that crazy to be maskless, some blue haired genderqueer 15 year old probably can't wait to put it on Twitter with some caption like "SDgskdJGKDSJGKAJG CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS KAREN?????" Now I pick up things for her when I'm at the store, or she uses instacart/shipt/whatever.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The most ironic part? She quite literally has PTSD. And that term gets thrown around so much by the liberal activists. When she tries to explain that emotionally and mentally, wearing a mask causes her too much distress, she gets mocked relentlessly. If anyone had any doubt that social activists and liberals in general are cowardly hypocrites, 2020 should have set that straight easily.</p>

        <p>This is why I can't fathom people that think masks should continue to be mandated until covid is "eradicated" or even beyond that. If we don't see these mandates expire by March or April when vaccines are widely available, we really need to organize and stand up against this.</p>

My own younger brother has told our entire family that he'll wear a face mask for the rest of his life, as he prefers it. That's his prerogative/right.whichever....I'm only tired of myself, friends, and family  being forced into compliance by a law with no logic behind it.</p>

That's why they mock her, because she has shown that she is vulnerable. Heartbreaking and enraging at the same time.</p>
<p>I have medical issues that prevent me from wearing a cloth or paper mask, and this is exactly why I refuse to explain myself. They don't believe me anyway, and I really shouldn't have to justify myeslf to anyone. People don't ask why you aren't wearing one in order to understand, they're just trying to argue. I've even had others with similar issues online tell me that if they can wear one, so can I. And they call us narcissists.</p>

<p>1000000%. It's all about the confrontation and the superiority complex, isn't it? I'm so sick of all these losers like "Look at me! I'm wearing a mask and my O2 saturation is 99%! Quit whining Karen!" That's great, and I am glad that you have a great circulatory system, but that has literally no bearing on my opinion on compulsory mask wearing, and if you approach me in public I'm going to tell you to get fucked, straight up. </p>
<p>I'm really really sorry to hear about your condition...this might not be ""medically sound"" but if you are forced to wear a mask to enter a grocery store, a strip of cheesecloth offers a LOT of breathability, as it's so thin and porous. That's been my experience at least, I'm sure thicknesses and materials differ.</p>

<p>I'll keep the cheesecloth suggestion in mind if I ever need to travel to a picky jobsite, but otherwise I either wear nothing or a bare minimum half plastic shield that attatches at the chin and lets fresh air circulate around my face. I've just embraced the "mega Karen" status at this point. If it's good enough for my job and for my doctor's office (which is full of actual immunocompromised people), then no one else gets to claim it's not enough for them. </p>

        <p>I absolutely detest it to. As someone who has always had anxiety in social situations I have always struggled with maintaining eye contact during social interactions. Now with the masks I can't even see people smiles which makes up at least a third of your facial body language. As a result I find it impossible to tell what emotions someone is trying to express. I actively find myself staring at somewhere else when taking to masked people now.</p>
<p>Plus a lot of the masks look like people are wearing sanitary towels on their faces and the thought of that makes me wretch.</p>

        <p>Yeah Ive felt the same from the start. I’m more disturbed by seeing people in masks, that creepy twilight zone brainwashed stare from a pair of eyes without a face, than I am from if I had to wear a mask. Which I have refused to do except for one time when I had a doc appointment.</p>

        <p>The masks are here forever unfortunately. They will never go away, neither will Covid. And we’re due for 3 more strains and one is deadly. Just gotta sit back and wait for the world to crumble. While you’re waiting, wake as many people up to the truth and the gospel.</p>
