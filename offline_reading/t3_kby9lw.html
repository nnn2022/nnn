    <strong>Thoughts on global COVID response</strong>
    <p><p>Posting here cause I can't think of another sub where this is appropriate. </p>
<p>I think the initial COVID response in the early part of the year was completely justified. A disease we know nothing about is spreading globally, the world's governments had to be cautious in my opinion. I honestly don't have an issue with masks, especially if wearing a mask is being enforced by a private company on their own property. What I don't like is that people in authority can't admit when they've change their stance on something, here's some examples: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We definitely had tighter restrictions when we had lower case numbers. This indicates to me that we either overreacted or that we couldn't sustain the restrictions any longer. It doesn't make sense and nobody is telling me why.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The initial recommendation was for people without symptoms not to wear masks. Sometimes I feel like I'm in the Twilight zone. Does nobody remember that we were supposed to save the masks for the people who needed it? Nobody I talk to seems to remember, I feel like I'm losing my mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There seems to be no consensus on when or how the pandemic will end, yet people talk like the solution is simple. The idea that if you stayed inside and wore a mask for 2 weeks that the virus would vanish is laughable. People have to go outside, go to work and interact with each other, complete isolation is impractical. I don't see how we expect that to happen.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm not a virologist, so I'm not going to claim to know better than people with "Dr." before their name, but a lot of this doesn't make sense and I'm sick of feeling like I'm insane for seeing contradictions and inconsistencies.</p></p>

        <p>I don't know if I'm bold enough to say all that. I've seen obvious points of manipulation. Like where I'm from we had a curfew lifted until right before an election and then reinstated immediately after. The term "mostly masked" has been thrown around a lot to obviously control which gatherings are ok and which ones aren't. But I find it hard to believe the whole pandemic was fabricated, manipulated surely, but not fabricated.</p>

        <p>No evidence of that in the slightest, Wonderful.</p>
<p>In fact all the evidence points to this being a natural virus since they found the same virus in the bodies of people who died 'strange deaths' in Nevada and New Mexico in Summer 2019.</p>
<p>Sorry: It's a natural virus, not 'carefully manufactured in a lab'.</p>

<p>i have been asking myself since march "ok. pandemic. allright. lockdown. what needs to happen for it all to end completely again?"</p>
<p>no appropriate answer was found, anywhere</p>
<p>right now the consensus to answer this question, at least in this sub, would be like:</p>
<p>"the pandemic measures end when the populace stops adhering to them en masse, thus considerimg them as useless, and/or too restroctive in general"</p>

        <p>Just wanted to say I don't think it was justified in the beginning. We didn't know if lockdown would be effective but we knew what damage it would cause from the start. It would have been justified to give elderly and vulnerable the option for quarantine.</p>
