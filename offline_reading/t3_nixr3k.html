    <strong>Similarities between Scientology and the Covid narrative</strong>
    <p><p>I've been watching Leah Remini's Scientology series and I've noticed many similarities with what's been going on the last year.</p>
<p>- Separation from family/friends and isolation<br>
- Following rules for "the greater good" (scientologists think they are saving the world/humanity)<br>
- Completely ignoring any information that does not fit with the story<br>
- Very emotional outburst vs people not agreeing with the guidelines or rules<br>
- Following every word from Fauci (L Ron Hubbard) and worship (fauci figurines)<br>
- Anyone not following the narrative is the enemy/outcast and is total scum and gets discredited<br>
- Snitch on a fellow Scientologist for not following rules or when they "have doubts"<br>
- Complete fabrication of numbers and news (Scientologists are shown videos where they are saving "thousands of addicts, homeless" etc)</p>
<p>There's a same kind of "main loop" going on too. Where the covidian is kept in fear because of "newly discovered mutants", the Scientologist gets stuck in loop with a story like "we have found new LRH textbooks in the secret vault XYZ" and they have to redo all the courses again (and pay for them too).</p>
<p>I feel like the "sea org" (the most dedicated Scientologists) for covid are the vaccinated who actually want digital vax passport. It's proof they are saving the world! How wonderful and noble.</p>
<p>Anything I missed here? I'm sure there are more.</p>
<p>I've seen the memes about covid being a cult a few times, and although I thought it was funny I didn't really felt like it was true. But after seeing these documentary videos... It's hard to deny.</p></p>

        <p>Its the same for any morally righteous ideology. The scary part is if it gets big enough to become accepted or at least tolerated among the population in general. That's when the killing starts to happen.</p>

        <p>As somebody that's been on the inside for a long time I can say that, Leah has a very inaccurate picture on Scientology. The whole separation thing is a last resort for people that are in a member's life that are causing them grief and all attempts to handle them have failed, of course those people that have been separated from are going to go out and complain and typically will bend the truth to sound like they're the actual victims. It's possible there is some kind of injustice in some cases and there are ways of being heard to rectify that if that is the case. All procedure is written into policy by the founder, so if something was done incorrectly that can be used to overturn it.</p>
<p>Also every group thinks that they are doing something good or they would never stay together, just because you disagree doesn't mean that they're wrong and just because they think they're right doesn't mean so either.</p>
