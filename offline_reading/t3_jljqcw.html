    <strong>Psychological Reasons People Accept Lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>I have been speaking with friends and family members who seem to accept the possibility of continuing lockdowns and mask usage, and in the case of my mother, the cancellation of Thanksgiving. That has disturbed but not surprised me to hear. The question is: what has led many to accept these perpetual restrictions on normal and healthy social interaction since the infamous "two weeks to slow the spread" situation in March?</p>
<p>One pithy psychological term describes the situation aptly. I contend that the foot-in-the-door phenomena encapsulates the behavior of people accepting perpetual lockdowns/mask usage. For those who are unaware, the foot-in-the-door phenomena is: "a compliance tactic that assumes agreeing to a small request increases the likelihood of agreeing to a second, larger request" (<a href="https://simplypsychology.org/">simplypsychology.org</a>). How that has played out since the inception of lockdowns is clear. State governments (I'm in US) asked citizens to socially distance and stay at home for two weeks to "flatten the curve" (a term that I have grown to resent). After those two weeks, the government made further requests for people to stay inside, slowly extending into mid May. Those requests were buttressed by the mainstream media and public health officials like Fauci assuring the public that it was for our own good. I would argue that by May the foot was firmly in the door.</p>
<p>Fast forward to August when social media/news was no longer solely focused on BLM, which had consumed the public discourse since late May. Then the narrative was swinging back to covid. At that point, I was convinced lockdowns would end and life would return to normal. But since the foot was in the door, the government asked the public to comply to health mandates due to "spikes" or "surges", and people did just that. By then, the commonly acknowledged length of lockdowns extended beyond the prior fortnight or month long time chunks, instead being analyzed seasonally... should we lockdown for just fall, or for winter too?</p>
<p>How do you think we can remove the proverbial foot from the doors of compliant citizens? How can we remind people that wearing a face mask is not in fact normal behavior, and is instead creepy and insidious? Those are a few of the questions I think must be addressed in the near future. I want the public to look upon the pre-covid world with longing and sentimentality, and then adjust their life to meet those standards accordingly. But that can not be done until we stop accepting ever-increasing government protocols. To break the chain of events suggested by the foot-in-the-door phenomena, one must deny a request made to them. That is crucial to do, for I do not want to go down the post-vaccine restrictions path that some, including our beloved Dr. Fauci, have proposed.</p></p>

        <p>Fear is a great motivator. As long as regular people fear this virus so much, they will be willing to give up one right after the other.</p>
<p>The issue is that most people, specially in developed countries, have lost the notion of evaluating risks. Their life’s are so safe that even this virus seems a great risk, they are not used to living with uncertainty. However, uncertainty and risk are a natural part of life and should be dealt with, not completely avoided.</p>

        <p>Its bizarre. Here in my area, we didn’t get any “spike” until after the first lockdown. In fact, we re-opened the day the BLM protests started, got put on a curfew for a few days bec of the protests, and then got hit hard. Enter: second lockdown. </p>
<p>After things leveled off, what did we do? We waited “2 more weeks” for several weeks, while things were fine...and just now re-opened schools for hybrid. Of course, cases are “spiking” again, so who knows what will happen.</p>
<p>My poor kids have been to a total of 3 half days of school, and we are in the “red zone” once more. </p>
<p>I don’t want to sound smug, but knock-on-wood, I still only know 2 people who have had covid. My 93 yr old Tata, and a Facebook friend (Both have recovered). I am (was?) an extremely active member of the community, I know a lot of people, and have even more friends on social media. I don’t want to be “that guy”, but I do find it odd that I don’t know more people effected by the virus. Dont get me wrong, that is a good thing, but still. </p>
<p>I think it would take some deprograming on a massive scale (media?) to get people out of their shells from this. I think we have reached a point where people are looking for affirmations that the virus is incredibly deadly and waiting to get them around every corner...because otherwise, the massive amount of fear, effort, and sacrifice they put into avoiding getting or spreading the virus, was all for nothing.</p>

        <p>Yes, I've been calling this the 'boiling frog' effect, but it's the same thing, I guess this is more written from the victims stand point and the boiling frog is from the persecutors standpoint.  Warm the water up a bit, let them get used to it, then warm it up a bit more.</p>
<p>I honestly think the other thing is there is a massive, and I mean huge, proportion of people who need to be told what to do.  Like, pathologically need to.  They don't think for themselves, they just do what they are told regardless as long as it's from a source that they have been told (indoctrinated) to trust, like the MSM / government.  This is evidenced by stuff like the Milgram experiments on obedience.  People distrust the government on things like tax promises and financial stuff, but barely anyone thinks the government will do something actively harmful to their health in order to further their own secret agenda, they literally can't conceive of that or dismiss such thoughts as 'conspiracy theories' even when presented with historical proof that governments do this kind of thing.  Just as some examples we could use COINTELPRO, Project Mockingbird or MK ULTRA, declassified CIA operations designed to manipulate public opinion, assassinate leaders of civil rights movements or test psychological techniques on the civilian population.  Even when I showed people these kind of things in pre-covid times along with the actual declassified documents, they would be pretty unwilling to entertain the thought or they'd say stuff like 'oh that was back in the 60s / 70s that would never happen now!'.  I'm not really sure how this squares with surveys that suggest, for instance, that 25%+ of the population think the official JFK assassination conspiracy theory is false and that the CIA had a hand in his assassination.  I guess they just divorce this incident from the rest of the evidence and don't believe the government would use large scale psychological manipulation techniques upon the entire populace, despite that we have evidence they were testing such things in the past and are now meant to believe they don't do it anymore.</p>
<p>So they will go along with whatever the line they are told is as long as it is about health / safety, combined with that need to be told what to do and what to think.</p>
