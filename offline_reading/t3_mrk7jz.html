    <strong>Serious: I had to get the shot or lose my job. A problem that some folks here might be dealing with and how I handled it.</strong>
    <p><p>Long time use here. My other reddit accounts were permabanned by reddit staff for my comments on another sub, but if mods want to verify my identity please contact me. </p>
<p>First: The pandemic response is so out of proportion it's like I'm taking crazy pills. I have to subscribe to hiding in my house and consuming products all for 0.1% chance of dying from covid. FUCK THAT. </p>
<p>I have been living a normal life ever since I woke up, around May 2020. These people bragging about how they're going to go out to eat or see their friends on reddit make me laugh. I've been doing that this last year. </p>
<p>Here's the problem. I was backed into a corner with the pfizer vaccine. I don't have to get it, but if I want to remain in deployable status for the military and not risk getting med boarded out I HAVE to get the shot. I dealt with this reality by getting lots of input from leadership in my unit and in other units. I contacts multiple people all over the military asking what they have heard. Unfortunately, I believe the rumors that for those that turn down the shot they will be slowly pushed out based on deployment status. In the military being non-deployable means you're getting pushed out in a couple years. I'm 4 years away from retirement so I'm not chancing it. </p>
<p>Here's what I did. I got the shot so my family can continue to live their lives without having to get it. My kids are healthy and living a normal live. My wife is living a normal life. I made the decision to work for my retirement so my family doesn't have to worry. </p>
<p>I hope this helps someone else that may be struggling with this problem.</p></p>

        <p>The 4th amendment protects you from having to take it. The military made it not mandatory. I was just on the marine sub and they said at Pendleton and Lejune that 80% are declining.</p>

        <p>No. I use the 4th. The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.  &lt;~ I take this to mean you can’t be asked for proof of vaccine to be allowed to be searched or held. You can tie numerous others in. 9th and 14th. I’ll be using the 2nd.</p>

        <p>I look at it as I'm doing this so my family doesn't have to deal with it. </p>
<p>Obviously I'm healthy and there's no sane reason to get a vaccine for something that isn't going to kill me. But I'm also not okay with losing a retirement and putting my family in that position. </p>
<p>I weighed the choices and unfortunately, this is the best path for my family.</p>

        <p>Interesting and nice, but do you agree that taking the vaccine because you’re worried you will actually be fired if you don’t is the wrong approach?</p>

        <p>Why should it help anyone to see that you were forced into something you didn't want? What's the big solution here? "Oh, they wanted to force me. And it worked." Great stuff, bro.</p>

        <p>I completely understand. I struggle with taking it when it becomes mandatory so I can keep my great job awhile longer. I'm pretty much guaranteed to make half my salary anywhere else, plus it may require a vaccine and mask wearing. This one is super lax on masks. If I didn't have a kid, I wouldn't give af.</p>

        <p>Each to their own, I guess. I decided my health is invaluable last year, and lost my jobs for refusing to wear a mask, so I won't have to worry about being "forced" to take the jab in order to keep a job. I can tell you I most certainly would absolutely not take the jab in that circumstance though. But that's just me.</p>
<p>But yeah, seems a little weird to come into this sub of all places and be like "yeah I took the jab even though I don't think it's a good thing, but I think it was a good decision overall because my family can still have their monopoly money..." ok then.</p>
<p>Guess I'm just a little jaded having stood up for what I believed in last year and lost 3 jobs for it, and then coming here and all the time hearing my fellow men and women who see what is going on still say they aren't willing to stand with me, on an even worse, more blatantly obvious as to what the right side is issue. If we all actually just stood for the truth, all at once now, this shit would be over. So many people last winter said "the vaccine is where I'll draw the line, if they make it mandatory" yet most of the people I heard say that in real life are lining right up for it. What gives?</p>

        <p>I completely feel guilty and sick but I'm close to retirement that I couldn't give that up. I had a moment of realization that if it ends up hurting me, at least my family doesn't have to endure that. I'll take that hit for them. </p>
<p>So I said "fuck it". Hopefully, I don't regret it. </p>
<p>But there is a silver lining to this. I get to use my position as a wedge between the propaganda and common sense. My work place still has restrictions and having the shot means I can maybe get people to wake up.</p>
