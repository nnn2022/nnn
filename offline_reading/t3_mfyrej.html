        <p>Tried to bring substance to this debate. The sheeple went crazy.</p>
<p>My comment/</p>
<p>A short case to end the mask mandate:</p>
<p>At what point do we stop ignoring the observational data? Every state or jurisdiction that ended mask mandates faired no different than its neighbours. South Dakota and North Dakota is perhaps the best example. Florida vs California (who mandated mask wearing even outside) is another based on climate and demographics. Then we have Texas.  They ended its mandate to a storm of online rage and virtue signalling, claiming it was reckless and would cost lives. In fact, cases can dropped 17-straight days since it ended its mandate absolutely destroying the alarmist narrative.</p>
<p>As for the science, when the CDC, WHO, Heath Canada reversed mask guidance I looked up studies on my university’s online library. Every peer-reviewed journal that used RCT statistical analysis concluded surgical and cloths masks were ineffective in preventing community spread of a respiratory/influenza viruses. You can see many of them yourself, just Google “do surgical masks work?” using the advanced settings on a desktop browser, and filter results to prior to 2020. Randomized controlled trails are the standard for scientific publications. All pro-masks papers did not perform RCTs, rather they were comparative analysis with stated limitations and assumptions. Even though the experiment was weak, the evidence for masks is even weaker! The difference in cases between populations was 0.7%/day (per the CDC’s most recent data) with a confidence interval that probably breaches 0%.</p>
<p>As for the “harder” science of mask capturing particles. The naked virus is in the range is 0.06 microns to .14 microns. Even a properly fitted N95 filters at 0.3 microns. As for surgical and cloth masks you can’t even find estimates because they would be embarrassingly bad(estimated 500-1000x larger than the naked virus). I’ve read a in vitro study that concluded parties wearing surgical masks would reduced ~20% of airborne particles carrying the virus. Again, this was an in vitro study not using live virus or how we wear masks and interact. In contrast, an MIT molecular biologist critiqued the study by theorizing that masks could nebulize the particles making them easier for the lungs to absorb. His hypothesis is just as valid science as he abstracted the experiment from other proven research.</p>
<p>Now, most Reddit users would immediately label me as a anti-masker moron. But I’m not, I am very pro-science (I have a MSc in an unrelated field from a top US school). Because I have read hundreds of research papers, and written unpublished ones of my own, I find it so intellectually dishonest to accept this narrative without proper backing. Can we just agree that the science at best is debatable and we are open to reviewing these policies? Right now the only accepted discourse is to believe “an anti-masker is selfish idiot! Trust the science!”. As much as you don’t like it, trusting the science would mean to accept masks are useless. Plus science requires constant experimental reviews and questioning of results. What we have with masks is far from science, it is public health dogma.</p>

        <p>After a year I shouldn't be surprised by those responses, but wow. This is such a well worded, evidence backed post, and every reply is just "you're dumb." I especially like the one who says they don't have time to (I'm paraphrasing) "correct all your bullshit." Hmm, maybe... or maybe no one can.</p>
<p>I had a similar experience last year posting on /r/nyc, before they banned me, including a response to a post that asked why people who don't wear masks don't.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. That is my favourite one too as she was responding to the one person who asked “why isn’t anyone posting counter arguments?”.
The vapid and rude remarks seem to be the only evidence they have.</p>
<p>And I’m sure if I was disrespectful to them in the slightest, I would be banned from the sub too.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah, I wasn't the least bit disrespectful when I got banned from /r/nyc. But everyone who replied to my comments were. The rules are selectively enforced, and this is in no way limited to COVID.</p>

        <p>On /r/nyc and /r/asknyc I got called so many awful things before they banned me. I've never had such insults lobbed against me in my life. My favorite was something along the lines of "he sounds like a miserable person, I would hate myself if I were his friend." If I'm so awful why would be my friend in the first place? And all I did was write things they didn't want to hear about masks and COVID 19.</p>

        <p>Looking at that thread is so telling. You were the only one there that posted scientific facts. The rest threw sticks and stones and had no intelligent argument to make. The brainwashing is real. DM me, fellow Haligonian. We both could use some new friends who think alike. Would love to go for a beer.</p>
