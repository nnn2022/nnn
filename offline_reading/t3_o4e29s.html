        <p>What astonishes me is how quickly we stopped talking about Cancer and Heart Disease. As if they just vanished into the wind like the seasonal Flu and suddenly a Covid death was vastly more serious and the suffering greatly outweighed any other death. </p>
<p>Because watching somebody die slowly of Cancer is not in the same league…..How fucking dare they!</p>

        <p>Probably because Cancer and Heart Disease aren't transmissible, but still, it is amazing how quickly everyone has been programmed to act like the concept of death is a new thing.</p>

        <p>Also that the PCR test was being misused with cycle thresholds greater than 35.  Last July, Fauci said:</p>
<p>&rt;“…If you get a cycle threshold of 35 or more…the chances of it being replication-competent are miniscule…you almost never can culture virus from a 37 threshold cycle…even 36…it’s just dead nucleoids, period.”</p>
<p>It was until Uncle Joe won that the WHO finally lowered the guidelines after countless international lawsuits.</p>

        <p>Kinda' like how they stopped testing people for the swine flu in 2009 after only 6 months. CDC stated if you had the flu in 2009 you more than likely had the swine flu and therefore testing was not needed.</p>

        <p>I'm still dumbfounded by how short everyone's memory is.  Britain has been the worst, with their absurd scary forecasts that never come close to true.  That one London guy started this with his "all going to die without lockdowns" chart that proved to have no connections at all with reality.  If their models have failed every single time in 18 months to have any predictive power, and every expert assessment in 18 months has been flat-out wrong, why are they still called experts?  SAGE especially needs a new acronym.  </p>
<p>Britain extending their lockdown on the advice of people whose advice has been completely 100% wrong in every way seems to be the height of idiocy.  Fauci and the CDC has been wrong on every prediction they have made too.  </p>
<p>This isn't how the "chicken little" fable was supposed to work.</p>
