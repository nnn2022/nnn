    <strong>The demand of masks in a non-perfect world</strong>
    <p><p>Here are examples of mask mandates being EXTREMELY dangerous because of human behavior and desperate situations: </p>
<p>Scenerio 1:</p>
<p>Someone needs to run in the store/ other establishment.The other person in the car can't go in for them for some reason (there are many situations this could be the case). The person who has to go in forgot their mask. They borrow a mask from the other car passenger. May sound fictional, but I've seen it happen more than once.</p>
<p>Scenerio 2: </p>
<p>This one has personally happened to me. I'm at a store with a very strict mask mandate. I use the bathroom. It's absolutely disgusting (ironic for an establishment who's so concerned with "safety"). I accidentally dropped my mask on the piss covered floor. Now I have to make a decision whether to put it back on my face so they'll let me check out. Luckily in this scenario I already did (check out), but how many people would have put it back on their face?</p>
<p>Scenerio 3:</p>
<p>An alcoholic needs a drink really bad. They don't have a mask for whatever reason. Then they spot it.....A mask laying in the parking lot that looks like it's been ran over and stepped on a few times. He's starting to get the shakes. So he says "fuck it" and puts it on to go in the store.</p>
<p>Leaving no room for situations like this causes more contamination due to people being in a hurry and getting desperate because of the no exception mask mandates. Yes, there are many of us who prepare for these situations, and try to have extra clean masks on hand. But not everyone does. I know this stuff sounds very far fetched, but it's happening. I've had people ask to borrow my used mask. I had one person tell me to feel how soft their mask was (after they wore it). I've seen people drop them on the floor and put them on. And some of these people I would not consider dirtballs. That's the problem. We as a society aren't use to the level of sanity precautions that wearing a mask (safely)  demands.</p>
<p>Side note: You ever see a mask on someone you WOULD consider a dirtball? That's some scary shit. Looks like a greasy, dirty pillowcase that hasn't been changed in 5 years.</p></p>

        <p>I've seen people who 'forgot' s mask and they just pull a shirt over their face. It probably does just the same as a mask anyway. You can cover your face with your elbow in case of emergency etc but you can also grow balls and stop wearing a mask if you're not a sheep and dont want to be looked at like one</p>

        <p>I work in a store, the shit I see with what people will put on their faces is so disgusting. I've seen completely dirty and masks with mold growing on them before. People pull a used one out of their pocket to put on. I have seen someone pick up a used cig off the ground and smoke it before, I wouldn't put it past them to wear a mask that was just one the ground either and it definitely has happened more than we want to believe. Masks in general are just gross after more than half an hour or so.</p>

        <p>Scenario 1: form the way you wrote it, it seems as though they were not wearing a mask before hand. Given the close proximity of car seats, if one has COVID then the other likely does too, and that chance isn’t going to be increased much by sharing that mask. Also easily avoidable, keep a pack of emergency masks in the glove box, keep your mask in your pocket as you do with wallet, keys, etc. </p>
<p>Scenario 2: why are you taking off the mask in the first place? You’d have to take it off for it to suddenly fall off, and not beforehand. Regardless, if you carry around a spare mask or maybe even two, you’d have no issues. You can happily abandon the other dirty one and wear a new one. </p>
<p>Scenario 3: You don’t seem to understand what addiction is. Just because there is an intense craving for a substance, doesn’t mean logic and common sense goes out the window. It’s extremely unlikely a person would ever be in a situation like that, and even if they were and went to pick it up, they’re not going to put it on their face unless they’re incredibly dumb. More likely is they’ll try to cover their face by pulling their shirt up and/or buy a pack of masks when they enter the store.</p>
<p>Your scenarios are all extremely unlikely and built in such a way that try and use ‘human behaviour’ to justify not wearing a mask inside a store.</p>

        <p>My point isn't to "justify not wearing masks in a store", although that is justified already in my eyes. My point is that zero tolerance mask mandates can create situations where people will pick a dirty mask over no mask just to be able to carry on their day. Either out of desperation, or out of convenience, or because they just aren't thinking about it. A person in a bathroom could take a mask off for many reasons. First off, it's the only place you can get privacy for a break. People also wipe the sweat off their face &amp; blow their nose. </p>
<p>And as for me not understanding addiction.....If you look at the subs I'm active in, you'll see a methadone sub. So yes, Im QUITE familiar with addiction.</p>

        <p>So you make up 3 unlikely situations, all of which can be avoided by simply carrying around a few extra masks, and decide this justifies not listening to health advice because your shower scenarios are somehow more important and ground breaking that scientists who’ve been working in this specific area for years. Right. Tbf you said yourself that not wearing a mask is already justified when you’re in a store, and while a look at your profile does show that you’re active in a substance abuse sub, it also shows that you’re active in multiple conspiracy theory subs. Again from your profile, you seemed to join Reddit because you couldn’t find any evidence to support your views from reliable sources, you claim that Biden is an unelected president, and you feed into every conspiracy possible. You’re desperate to believe something which simply doesn’t exist, and people like you are the reason American has such a bad reputation. Everything has to become political, everything has to be dramatised, even if it kills people (guns, COVID, Trump cult, human rights, equality, so on).</p>

        <p>I joined reddit in 2/20 because I actually thought the media/ government was UNDERREPORTING the covid situation. I was the ONLY one wearing a mask at this time and was shamed for it at stores and even doctors offices. Then all of the sudden the world became brainwashed, were on board with masks, and didn't notice that things wearn't adding up. I was a big supporter of masks, if they were high grade, and if they were worn properly. I washed my hands before putting it on and after taking it off, and didn't reuse them. I was even considering buying a $1500 3M PAPR Unit because that's what it takes when your dealing with a pandemic. ..Even through all of this, I wouldn't dream of MAKING anyone wear a mask, even at  though at the time, I did think I was in danger because of it. </p>
<p>Ok, one more time with this. I'm not using those scenerios to justify "people not wearing" masks. I'm using those scenerios to show that the  state should not mandating be them, or not allowing exceptions. Human behavior was one of the reasons Fauci sited when the mask issue first arose. And trust me, after he made that statement I REALLY got hate for wearing a mask. I remember one day running into a coworker at Walmart and her asking "are you sick? What's with this" (pointing to her face).</p>
<p>I know it's low hanging fruit to talk shit on conspiracy related media, but like it or not, many have been accurate about lots of shit. If I had to take bets on Infowars or CNN on accuracy, my money would bet on Infowars everytime. The problem is, sometimes it can't be proven in real time. Their content ages much better and shows to be accurate.</p>

        <p>The government doesn't care about people. Can't speak for anywhere but here in the UK, but the conservatives suck and really couldn't be asked with anything. You say you wear a mask, and that your problem is with making people wear a mask through mandates etc. Are you naïve enough to believe that if there weren't mandates, people would voluntarily wear a mask, given all the drama and nonsense news there is which people happily feed into? What's the difference between saying people have to wear masks in stores etc and saying people have to wear seatbelts whilst driving, or have to follow certain speed limits depending on what road they're on, or literally any other law which has a purpose of preventing loss of life? I'm not saying this as an attack, it just seems super confusing to everyone else</p>

        <p>I don't necessarily believe that seatbelts should be mandatory either. I don't wear a mask anymore by the way. When the pandemic started looking fishy combined with the masks becoming mandatory, I started to rebel. I still have to sometimes, but it's homemade and it's sports mesh. And it's white so it can be bleached, often. I also pull it down every chance I get. I've done a 180 since this thing started. I was so far ahead of everyone. I was able to buy many supplies that people waited around to get because "that virus in china won't affect us". All of it is useless to me now because it's not needed. </p>
<p>So in the UK, does the government pay the hospitals to label any dead body they can get ahold of a covid death? That's their signature move here. Along with making executive orders to drop liability from medical staff, ease up on record keeping, &amp; make sure no autopsies are done on bodies that "died of covid". They also pay the hospitals extra for intubating patients, which 9/10 leads to the patient's death. Unscrupulous (lazy) medical staff were  using intubation as a babysitter. You cannot believe the stats on this disease. They are highly skewed. Probably 10x inflated.</p>
<p>The (American) government's job should be to protect from foreign enemies, issue a currency, and make sure the constitution is upheld. That is about it. It shouldn't be their job to take care of anyone, make sure people are taken care of cradle to grave, etc. Their job should be to get out of the way and leave people alone. Because it becomes a very slippery slope.</p>
<p>The UK is different. I don't know what the consensus is among your people with all this. From what I see they don't like it either.</p>

        <p>I'm Really going to blow your mind now. You ready for this one, I don't think drugs should be illegal either. ALL OF THEM. And that doesn't mean I support drug use or think they are healthy. I just don't think it's the governments place to make that decision for someone. And no, being high would not be an excuse for committed another crime or being intoxicated driving. It shouldn't be a free pass to commit other crimes.  The government &amp; private prisons make money off of people's suffering. And with the stuff we know from Iran Contra, the government is complicit in bringing drugs in.</p>

        <p>Except when it DIRECTLY effects someone. Theft if property, theft of life, etc. Mask usage doesn't fall into this catagory because there are variables involved.

        <p>So wait, the government should only interfere and make regulations over things which directly affect the individual, others, or both? I’m confused.</p>
<p>Regardless, that’s not how the vast majority of countries operate. If thats  your viewpoint then sure, you’d probably be a lot happier camping, sailing, joining a tribe, just anything away from modern society.</p>

        <p>Anything that effects oneself shouldn't be interfered with. Others yes. It's not how they run but they should.  Seatbelts have only become mandatory since I believe the 90s. That was 60+ years of studies etc to prove this is beneficial. This mask thing is loosing credibility quickly. I think when all have the mandates have dropped were gonna find out how harmful they were. There is some evidence now and lots of anticdotal evidence. They will only admit to it afterwards.

        <p>But masks are not a new thing, they’ve been used by doctors and surgeons for similar, if not identical purposes for years. We’ve had variations of masks historically to protect us from has attacks during war, some highly polluted areas in China have also worn masks long before COVID due to the amount of toxicity in the air. You can’t argue masks don’t work because you simply have no genuinely reliable evidence to support that argument. The reason everyone has had to wear a mask with “little” research is because no government other than the few who are now out of lockdowns planned for COVID to spread at such a rate, and in some cases purposefully didn’t take action quick enough to deal with it. </p>
<p>If you want to live like a hippie and be your own boss, fine. Go do it away from civilisation. Masks are to protect others, they don’t protect the wearer. it’s simply selfish to not wear a mask, mandated or otherwise</p>

        <p>They later found out that bacterial pneumonia caused many of the deaths during the spanish flu, not the flu itself. Basically from the unsanitary mask usage. I just recently learned that even masks in medical industry has some people questioning it and its basically theater, to make it appear more professional.  Apparently it's debated in the dental industry, which I didn't know until a few weeks ago. And by the way, it also turns out that asymptomatic transmission is either very rare of non-existent. So I agree if you're sick stay home. If you walk around worrying that you could catch something from someone, why not just wear a mask all the time, forever, since anyone can be sick at anytime. Life is full of risk. Nobody is guaranteed health or X amount of years on this earth. People with asthma and COPD shouldn't have to put themselves at risk because of the small chance they COULD be sick when there's a 100% chance the mask aggregates their issue. People who overheat easily shouldn't have to have extra layers on their face, especially in hot weather.  It's been admitted that it's not about people's expelled breath, it's being pushed for  psychological purposes.  They aren't afraid of people's breath, they are afraid of people seeing an unmasked person, and what that represents (lack of fear and breaking conditioning).</p>
