    <strong>Family division</strong>
    <p><p>Here's a story for you:</p>
<p>I take my kids on a biannual road trip to visit my mom in another province (in Canada). Borders have been closed due to covid - so we haven't seen Grammy in a year.</p>
<p>My sibling hates our mother. My sibling's cancer came back after they got their 2 covid jabs (but doesn't put 2 and 2 together). My sibling is about to go on a month long vacation, road tripping across the nation. Immediately upon returning from the road trip, they will be starting their cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Sibling calls me to ask about vaccine status - I tell them it'll never happen unless I am literally threatened with being thrown in jail for it. They start their defense, I am prepared with my arguments (the foremost being that the vax doesn't even stop you from catching/spreading the virus, and the next being that being unvaxxed doesn't automatically mean you're infected with the virus). They can't win the argument - they're not interested in learning my why's. They don't care.</p>
<p>So they call our mother to tell her that they need her help during cancer treatment, so it would be imperative that she doesn't socialize with unvaccinated people. </p>
<p>I have been uninvited to my mother's house.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that NO EVIDENCE EXISTS the vax stops you from catching/spreading the virus. Despite the fact that my sibling will be on a month long road trip, interacting with unvaxxed people every step of the way (and stopping in several parts of the country that have some of the highest unvaxxed rates in the nation). Despite the fact that my sibling hates my mother. </p>
<p>This is the length that my OWN FLESH AND BLOOD will go through to try and teach me a lesson. </p>
<p>Regardless, I haven't spoken to my mother or sibling since and have blocked their numbers on all my devices.</p></p>

        <p>We're hearing more and more reports of this. I am experiencing it myself.</p>
<p>It seems part of the Covid-19 agenda is to separate and divide people even within their own families.</p>
<p>Remember, there's an underlying economic activity happening beneath all this, and it is division that keeps us from ever uniting to do anything about it. It is an interesting coincidence that the people protesting BLM and militantly forcing vaccines on us are the people who would have been at Occupy rallies in 2008 Financial Collapse era. These people were distracted from their economic protests and turned instead into a manufactured racist and medical divide.</p>
<p>That division is why most of us work our entire lives away to make a small number of people more wealthy than we can even comprehend. As in -- literally global control amounts of wealth.</p>
<p>Control of our education system followed by screen addiction is the means by which they control the mind. But now I'm going off subject...</p>
<p>Back to your family. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want fair-weather friends and fair-weather family members that turn against me in addition to what the whole world is doing to us right now.</p>
<p>I mean, we are painted as extremists. Really think about that. All we're asking for is pre-2020 life and a CHOICE about whether or not we want the Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>How the heck are they making us into extremists when they are the ones that turned our entire world upside down over a virus with a 99.5+% survival rate?</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that, but family can be sometimes the worst people in your life, when it comes to your dreams, goals or wants or decisions.</p>
<p>If they truly loved  you, they would respect what you love, and would respect your decisions  you make for yourself. They realize they don't have to agree - but they leave it at that, and do not love you any less.</p>
<p>For many of us though, family love seems to be conditional to you doing what THEY WANT, and sometimes we have to cut ties with them to be the best person we can be.</p>

        <p>Unblock them. I’m not being virtuistic - I think this will piss off your siblings even more. Talk to your mom on the phone and pitty the sibling fighting cancer. They want you to be sad and miserable like they are. Don’t let them.</p>

        <p>See the thing is... I'm not sad and miserable. One of the reasons my sibling wants to discount all of my opinions and facts I laid out is because (NOT A HUMBLE BRAG) I "live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood in one of the most expensive cities in north america." Therefore I am "entitled", "out of touch", "privileged", and akin to "Gwyneth Paltrow telling people to cure their cancer with kale". I'm not paraphrasing. These are literal quotes of what my sibling said to me.</p>
<p>I'm not miserable. I'm happy. My spouse and I work so hard, we made so many sacrifices to get to where we are, I have a loving immediate family, I AM fortunate and blessed. </p>
<p>My sibling is the one who is MISERABLE AND SAD.</p>

        <p>That is a terrible situation to be in; I doubt there's a right answer.  Does your mom have favorites?</p>
<p>If she doesn't, appeal to her.  There is no wrong or right when it comes to family - just arguments for/against.</p>
<p>Life is incredibly short.  In the grand scheme of things, shit like vaxx/unvaxxed is trivial.  Ask yourself, how much do you love/care about your mom and sibling?</p>
<p>If I were you, I'd probably lie and say that I got my vaxx, just to be around them.  Some philosopher once said 'it's better to ask for forgiveness than ask for permission.' Once/if they find out you lied, just say sorry.</p>
<p>My two cents.</p>
