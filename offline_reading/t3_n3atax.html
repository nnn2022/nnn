    <strong>Shedding</strong>
    <p><p>Hey, my parents have recently both received both shots. I have started to have Covid-like symptoms, a mild headache that occurs periodically, very mild cough, and some phlegm.  </p>
<p>However, if the shedding theory is right, it is the spike protein being transmitted to me. This is the same spike protein of Covid 19, and is basically what is responsible for the symptoms and consequences of catching Covid. </p>
<p>This makes me feel okay, because now I know that I probably am just sick from the spike protein thats within Covid which, might, give me immunity. Either way, I am young, and am fine, and this will probably go away. (I have had these recurring symptoms for about one and a half to two weeks)</p>
<p>However, it is still scary to imagine that the virus itself could be transmitting the spike protein which is responsible for the deadly symptoms and effects of Covid themselves.</p>
<p>Just felt like sharing my thoughts.</p></p>

        <p>You could be right. It could also just be allergy season. I don't think phlegm is generally a covid symptom.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that correlation is not necessarily causation (a scientific principle that was completely thrown out the window for the "deaths with covid" count).</p>

        <p>Thanks for sharing. Hopefully your symptoms go away and remain mild. Research more on shedding. From what I’ve read / heard, there’s a lot of serious long term side effects for both males / females.</p>

        <p>Yeah, if you try research vaccine shedding you will just be bombarded with a million fact check organization pages. But, if you filter it correctly, and search in between, say, 2000 and 2015, there are actual scientific studies and articles that support the notion that vaccine shedding exists, and that ask the question. </p>
<p>Here is some literature: <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/02/02/702199/10118172/en/Studies-Show-that-Vaccinated-Individuals-Spread-Disease.html">https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/02/02/702199/10118172/en/Studies-Show-that-Vaccinated-Individuals-Spread-Disease.html</a></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15954490/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15954490/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24076325/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov › ...</a>  </p>
<p>I think I will probably be fine, since this spike protein is the same one which is responsible for the lethality of Covid, which for my age, is totally fine and mostly benign.</p>
<p>&rt;Hopefully your symptoms go away and remain mild.</p>

        <p>Hey ! thanks for sharing your thoughts with us, it`s a great thing. Im not sure how i should reply to this tho.. ill just point out some things and u just filter them as you see fit.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>1) Headaches = lots of possible causes. Might be totally unrelated to your parents and their vaccination. Or it could be .. </p>
<p>2) "Covid-like" symptoms = yearly flu, blood, lungs, neurological, infections, and couple other health problems symptoms. There are no unique symptoms related just to Covid19.</p>
<p>3) Spike protein does not give you immunity. It tries to teach your lymphocytes (immune system) how to fight the next wild virus that enters your body and has a similar spike protein (alot of coronaviruses out there). However, the teaching process might fail and create a bunch of oposing reactions.Also your lymphocytes might be bad students and skip class, learning nothing.</p>
<p>4)  Beeing young and fine has nothing to do with avoiding spike protein long term damages.Young people are actually more at risk from vaccines, because theyir immune system is "raw" and strong, that`s why you see just a low number taking the usual flu shot every year and it`s more recommended to those with problems and after a certain age.</p>
<p>5) Hearing someone tell you that Covid19 vaccine antibodies are better than your own, is like comparing powdered to milk to normal one.</p>
<p>6) The virus is not transmiting any spike protein. It`s not like a hat that he can throw away when it gets hot outside.Vaccines contain exclusively the manufacturing process of protein S and nothing else. There is no original viral genome in any of them.</p>

        <p>Ive had the same experience.. weird kind of pressure in my head for 3 days straight. Short term memory and slightly confused for the first 2 days. My dad tested positive and his boss aswell.. they had the same symptoms. I never went to get tested, I just went back to work as usual.. but my dads gf has been vaxxed with Pfizer.. gonna be interesting to see if it comes back again when he starts seeing her again</p>

        <p>I also have a shedding story</p>
<p>Friday I was feeling fine, walk into the small post office (vaxxed worker) get my package walk to my car and felt so dam sick like I was going to pass out. I sat for a bit drank some water then drove to town to grab something to eat that will help, as I drove (15 mins) I felt worse and worse. Like really weak, wanted to puke, hands shaking, fatigued. I grab some food, park, eat and still feel terrible. I had to get my husband to come get me. Later I could drive, food did help the shaking but it's Sunday and I still feel totally zapped of energy and nauseous. Wtf happened to me. Also I rarely get sick and I also have no other cold like symptoms.</p>
<p>What's goin on man</p>

        <p>No one making these “shedding” claims has even attempted to present any evidence of it being true. It began as a rumor on social media (perhaps deliberately started) and is now settling in amongst the general “covid is nbd/fake” populations. Two geniuses in Italy just tried to blow up a vaccination site, probably motivated by this “shedding” meme. And guess what, it’s a common anti-vax position that predates the coronavirus by decades </p>
<p>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_shedding</p>
<p>So many have labeled all info about the pandemic as propaganda engineered by nefarious, agenda-riddled parties, but still happily swallow propaganda that adheres to their beliefs.</p>

<p>Before this vaccine, it was pretty much a discussed question, and there was a lot of literature which claimed vaccine shedding to be real. I'm not saying its real for sure, just entertaining its possibility.</p>
<p>If you want to do more research, you have to make sure to filter Google correctly. You would want to search for instance, as I had, in between the years 2000 and 2015, in order to get more unbiased results, or else you will just be bombarded with fact checks and no meaningful scientific literature.</p>
