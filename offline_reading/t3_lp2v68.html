        <p>YouTube's goal is watch time. If they know you can be convinced or are not sure, they will target you. They know I am not budging. If I go there when not logged in, I get nothing but Vevo and covid-19 propaganda.</p>

        <p>Obviously, because the way I see it, to be called an expert, you need to have the expertise, which in science sort of comes with a diploma in a specific field. Now when I think about it... Does this guy even have a PhD in any field? Just did a super fast google search and didn't find anything</p>

        <p>His credentials state "director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health." He's been in that position since 1984. Also he has been an advisor to every president since Raegan. He's done research into HIV/AIDS since the 80's (Virology and immunology). So I'm not quite sure why you are saying he is unqualified. Who do you think would be a better fit for the position?</p>

        <p>Anyone who actually did some research in the field? Note how what you're citing here does not include anything a scientist would consider a credential. The guy managed to get a job and is good at selling ideas to politicians. That's about it.

        <p>Look, if you’re going to sell anyone as a “fraud” in science, Dr. Fauci is probably not a great place to start.</p>
<p>For one, he does have a doctoral-level degree: he graduated top of his class with an M.D. from Cornell. This is just one quick Wikipedia search from either of us, so I wonder how diligent you are with checking your sources on things like this.</p>
<p>Also, to suggest that this man “doesn’t do research in his field” is flatly ridiculous. To save some time, here’s his archived pages on Google Scholar:</p>
<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0dDO3SAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</p>
<p>You can read through the abstracts of many of his hundreds of publications, particularly the many in the fields of infectious respiratory illness. </p>
<p>On top of this, he’s held his position as the NIAID director since 1984, and was instrumental in the fight against AIDS as a frontline researcher and public health official. I do sincerely hope you don’t also view that as some fake illness. </p>
<p>Their are certainly people we can criticize as unethical in the field of science, but it seems like attacking this man isn’t really done in good faith; it’s just necessary for this community since his views on COVID are clear and decisive.</p>

        <p>I'm not saying he's a fraud. I'm merely saying he's no expert in the field, and BTW to the best of my knowledge he never said that himself either, so I'm I'm having a hard time understanding why people regard him as such. Be objective and think about it. MD isn't a researcher. Professional, sure, but not an researcher. And on top of that, if you spend last 40 years dividing your time between advising politicians and being an administrator in a hospital, how much actual medical practice can you possibly get done? C'mon.</p>

        <p>I understand your concern, but I’d love to hear your response after actually going through his research. At the end of the day, in the field of science, I don’t think you can get away with being as respected and prolific for that long if you’re not a true expert.</p>
<p>I really do get the impulse not to trust someone who’s been involved in government for so long; I share that. But we shouldn’t let that bias blind us against a man with over 200,000 peer citations, and an h-index of over 220 (truly insane - most top-level researchers sit from 150-170). </p>
<p>Look, it’s hard to litigate a field you’re not in, and I’m not a scientist. But unless you’re a prolific researcher, I doubt either of us are fully qualified to determine who is or isn’t qualified to be giving us scientific advice. But, from the looks of it, you’re looking at Garry Kasparov and saying he’s no expert at chess, or Carl Jung and saying he knows nothing of psychology.</p>
<p>I ask you again, if not by traditional modes of citation: peer acclaim, education (an MD is adequate for research - many researchers were at one point practicing physicians - and summa cum laude from Cornell is clearly more than adequate), citation, the h-index, and high-ranking positions in the field of medicine, how exactly are we supposed to evaluate who is or isn’t a “good” researcher? Our gut? Whether or not they agree with us? Be honest with yourself, and ask whether or not you’d have these same concerns if Fauci were instead staunchly anti-lockdown, and had written many articles on a lack of negative effects pertaining to COVID-19. I’d venture to guess your and this sub’s concern over this man’s “credentials” would disappear.</p>
<p>If there’s something I’ve missed, and this is really a shill fake scientist who’s planting all of this evidence to confuse me and indoctrinate me into the cabal of deep state globalists, then I’d be happy to hear the opposition 🙂</p>

        <p>I'm not saying he's a fraud. I'm merely saying he's no expert in the field, and BTW to the best of my knowledge he never said that himself either, so I'm I'm having a hard time understanding why people regard him as such. Be objective and think about it. MD isn't a researcher. Professional, sure, but not an researcher. And on top of that, if you spend last 40 years dividing your time between advising politicians and being an administrator in a hospital, how much actual medical practice can you possibly get done? C'mon.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry while I respect your opinion, I don't share it. This guy has allot of experience in virology and immunology on a detailed level. On top of that he's been the communications arm between the scientists and the presidents for 40 years and has proven that he can convince administrations to listen to experts alongside himself.</p>

        <p>a bunch of presidents and many experts with degrees in the fields you are talking about disagree with you. So no I'm not BS'ing "chief". Aside from that no one here who has been downvoting me has offered a better suggestion...</p>
