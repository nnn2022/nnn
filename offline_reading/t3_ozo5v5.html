<p>Dan literally gets up there every day and lies and people still seem to believe it.</p>
<p>These so called "positive Covid-19 test" that have been found in sewerage turned out to be a false positive (that was Dans excuse for locking down rural Vic) and they come out today and have all of a sudden found 2 more positive tests elsewhere. 
It's just lie, after lie, on top of a lie.

        <p>'Viral fragments found' is just the biggest load of shit though. But if you've seen the way theyve actually sequenced this virus, you'll know this whole thing really is literally made up. Virus never isolated. Sequence only exists on a computer. Researcher proved they could get the same proof of virus being present in the incubation process outlined with no sample at all. They have literally created this whole thing out of thin air... its all ... nothing... the pcr doesn't tell the difference between flu and covid.... its not strange that cases of flu plummeted but this brand new virus only this pcr test can detect is finding all these cases of covid...or flu...but probably covid... ahh we will assume it's covid even though it also could be just detecting flu virus.... nahhh must be covid... which seems to have cured flu....wow....its insanity.</p>

        <p>It absolutely is 100% bullshit.
That said I'm not surprised.
They will make up whatever they can to keep us in lockdown till we are vaccinated. </p>
<p>You're absolutely spot on about the PCR test's. 
People have to stop getting tested.
Without number's they have nothing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they just make it up as they go and we have to live with the decisions made by legitimate criminals. </p>

        <p>Hahaha but Andrews even used the fact that there weren't many tests being done to keep us locked down. So, if they have the numbers they will use that,  and if they don't have people showing up to give them those numbers, well, the punishment was all the same. This is a dictatorship. In fact, every single covid thing theyve put in place since April 2020 is bunk. They had the treatment available bug decided to classify it as a poison based on 9 studies that were done incorrectly,  some of which have since been retracted. Hydroxychloroquine uses zinc as an ionophore allowing access across infected cell membranes resulting in the virus, let's call it common cold or flu at thus stage, to not be able to replicate. They chose to go with experimental shots over a safe 70 year old drug. Morons?  Threy couldn't possibly not understand the treatment... they must be corrupt.</p>

        <p>Yeah while I do agree with you somewhat he has definitely used that as an excuse but it appears to me that even more people aren't.
That's why he is so persistent with "get tested".
He's panicking because people are finally starting to see through all his bull shit and if only a couple of hundred people are showing up he can't get number's from an already faulty test.
We are getting to a point where more people are waking up and I believe it's to a point where the people of this state will not accept low testing numbers as a reason for lockdowns.</p>
<p>Do I think he would make them up?
I already believe he is making them up.
I would say around 50% of these "mystery cases" are absolute horse shit, 40% are positives due to a faulty test and the other 10% would have Covid-19. </p>
<p>Yeah that an Ivermectin that is proven that if everyone started using Ivermectin tomorrow we would be able to completely eliminate Covid-19. </p>
<p>Ivermectin is not under patent which means (as I'm sure you know) that ANY pharmaceutical company could make it and deliver it worldwide, it cost's between $1 to $3 to make a single dose.</p>
<p>These mRNA vaccines are under patent which means only owners of the patent can give authorisation to a pharmaceutical company to produce it.
Those cost anywhere between $25 to $30 per dose.</p>
<p>There's absolutely no doubt in my mind they are corrupt.</p>

        <p>We are definitely at that point right now.
The thing people don't seem to understand is once they gain this power, it's going to be nearly impossible for us to get it overturned. </p>
<p>I truly believe that in Victoria more people are starting to wake up and realise the severity of the situation we are currently in, I personally can't speak for the rest of Australia as right now my main concern is my home state Victoria. </p>
<p>But yes, 100% we are on a knife's edge and it could go either way depending on how we the people handle these situations before they arise, not after.</p>

        <p>I couldn't agree more!
It just sucks that it takes a global pandemic for people to realise that no matter what differences they may have with another they are still your equal and you should always treat other's with respect (that is not at all a reflection of you that's an overall statement).</p>
<p>I'm definitely more hopeful but I'm also incredibly concerned about how fast this is all happening combined with the fact that it has taken 6 lockdowns for people to see what is going on.
That said we need to stay positive and band together and make sure every single one of these politicians is made to answer for there crime's.</p>

        <p>Protest. 
We have to Protest, I personally believe it needs to be every weekend until Dan is removed and we have in writing there will be no further lockdowns. 
As far as Morrison he also needs to steal down and we need in righting that there will be no vaccine passports. </p>
<p>The only we are going to have any chance of making this happen is constant protests and people also need to stop getting tested. 
The PCR tests are faulty. 
If you have a cold and you get a PCR test it will register as positive and they count that as a Covid-19 positive.
People MUST stop getting tested.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns were never in the pandemic response plan, which baffles most of us. WHO recommended it to China which helped curb the initial outbreak but they didn't suggest it to any of country. Dan continues to say that it's "based on science". Fucking sick of hearing him say that dribble.</p>

        <p>Yeah unfortunately they all read from the same script. 
Anyone with half a brain knows that lockdowns are doing more damage then good.
The virus spreads Indoors so let's lock everyone indoors and not let them out in the open where the virus can't spread.</p>
<p>Nothing he says is based on science. 
If it was he would be talking about how people who are vaccinated are actually turning out to be better host's for the mutations of Covid-19, he would also be talking about the fact that viruses as they mutate do in fact become more transmissible but as they do they become less deadly. 
I've also heard there are scientific paper's that are suggesting that the vaccines are the cause of these mutations (I have not looked at or read these paper's yet so I can't confirm this to be 100% fact) I will however be having a look into them before the end of the weekend to make sure I do have all the available information with source's.</p>
<p>All of this is to force people into a position where they feel they have no other choice other then to take an unproven, experimental drug.
It's quite literally blackmail. </p>
<p>I'll also add that the government's of our country are pushing so hard right now for people to get vaccinated because the longer we hold off the more time we have to actually see the long term effects these vaccines actually have.</p>

        <p>All I can say is keep fighting the good fight, I agree with everything you're saying along with the points you make about vaccinated bodies being more likely to mutate the virus - this was warned by multiple health experts around the world when they pleaded for the vaccine to be further researched. I really do wish more and more people would wake up and see it but they're too brainwashed. The govt. Is literally dangling out freedoms like a carrot in front of our face. Vitamin D also has many benefits to fight the virus...but no no we must stay inside.</p>

        <p>You to my man!
If you ever head to any protests moving forward and you go solo hit me up! ü§ôüèΩ</p>
<p>Yeah unfortunately the actual health experts and scientists are being silenced on all platform's which means people who may be unsure don't know where to go to find alternative views.</p>
<p>100% it's literally you get a vaccine or you stay in lockdown.
I'll also add that it's also a divide and conquer tactic.</p>
<p>This is why for me personally I will always talk TO another not AT them.
But even with that said it's almost becoming a crime to share a different view and further more discuss the opposing view which is happening globally and is an enormous concern!</p>

        <p>The most terrifying this about The State of Emergency is that Dan is currently in the process of putting together what he is calling the "Permanent Pandemic Plan" which will come in for the SOE which end's early December. 
There's still no clear understanding of what will be involved in that bill but it seems as though it will be put in place so he can bypass having to make up Bullshit excuses every 4 week's to renew it as he has to now.</p>
