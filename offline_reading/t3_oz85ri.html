    <strong>Does no one know how to read a chart?</strong>
    <p><p>"Things are going to get worse"/"New variants could emerge": quotes yesterday from Fauci.</p>
<p>This is what everyone in the media, and those who can't think critically, are freaking out about: cases apparently increasing 10-fold since June (in the United States): </p>

<p>And here's how deaths have plummeted in the same time: </p>

<p>That crazy lady from the CDC should be getting behind a microphone and saying this is wonderful news, this thing is petering out quickly. When the numerator gets smaller and the denominator gets bigger, even my cat could figure out that that means the virus is getting less and less deadly. We should be welcoming this. Society should be thrilled.</p>
<p>Which can only mean one thing: time to ramp up the restrictions! Private companies mandating vaccines for workers. Tyrannical governments denying indoor access to the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>These "people of science" are flying in the face of science, and ignoring basic math. But no, anyone who thinks this is a conspiracy is crazy.</p></p>

        <p>as soon as the “delta variant” emerged, a virologist noted that when a virus is dying out, it makes itself much more contagious, but that when it spreads itself out like that, it becomes less lethal. and every actual statistic supports that</p>

        <p>Yes this is what happens to every virus. I remember I said that a few months ago, that as the pandemic goes on this virus will become more virulent and less deadly. I got blasted haha.</p>

        <p>If the media did not have COVID they would be absolutely fucked. Think of how much ratings dropped since Trump left office and they could not write 20 stories a day about him. People love to click on COVID stories so of course the media is screaming bloody murder over absolutely nothing because their industry depends on it. Some brain dead person on a COVID subreddit told me the delta variant is KILLING lots and lots of children. This statement is totally detached from reality but he was convinced it was true.</p>

        <p>you have to keep in mind that most people just follow along with what the news tells them, which is “omg cases are going up!!! it’s dangerous!!! it’s going to kill us all!!!” without providing any numbers. anyone who looks at the graph from the past few months can tell that deaths are not increasing with the amount of cases.</p>

        <p>This would be true if any of this were about health, safety, etc. We know by now that it's not.</p>
