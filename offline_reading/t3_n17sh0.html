        <p>Trump also got the vaccine even though he already had covid. I’d like to think the former president is a smart and informed guy. He knows more than us and I’m sure he wouldnt have got it if he didn’t think it was necessary. Trump hates extra ‘pork’ aka stuff that’s not necessary.</p>

        <p>The sad thing is tens of thousands will die, maybe 100s of thousands, from the vaccines...mostly democrats. Next census  will not have very many living in communist aka democratic states unless independents and republicans move back.</p>

        <p>Might be outdated, but I remember the seven people that died of blood clots from the JJ vaccine. About 95 million people are vaccinated in the US so far. Let’s say those who got the JJ shot compose 1/20 of that ~4750000. 7/4750000, then subtracting the quotient from 1 is about 99.99985 after you multiply by 100. I need to be corrected.</p>

        <p>Because I’m young and healthy and have a 99.9% chance of surviving covid. The vaccines however are still in clinical trials until 2023 and I don’t want to be a test subject. There’s is no reason for me to take mRNA therapy when statistics show I clearly don’t need it. I’m also have an autoimmune condition and would be an idiot to take a rushed mRNA therapy at this point. </p>
<p>The at risk can get vaccinated and then they don’t have to worry about dying from covid. What I do as a young healthy person has nothing to do with that.</p>
<p>^ this is critical thinking. What you’re doing is rationalizing the popular narrative. YOURE the one who isn’t critically thinking and you projected your ignorance onto me. </p>
<p>But please explain it to me, if everybody can get vaccinated who am I protecting by getting vaccinated other than myself?</p>

        <p>How anyone can say this:</p>
<p>&rt; you still lack the ability to think critically. </p>
<p>And then unironically say this in the very next sentence:</p>
<p>&rt; Why would you refuse a proven and safe vaccine</p>
<p>boggles my mind.</p>
<p>You people are beyond help. The vaccine is an unknown risk - i.e. you simply cannot quantify how dangerous it is yet. Which means it's anything but proven - it literally cannot be proven and won't be for many, many years. On top of that, Big Pharma is known to exaggerate and hide risks whenever it promotes new drugs. It's their modus operandi.</p>
<p>If you're stupid enough not to realise that it's way  riskier to take these darned things than catch a virus with a 99.9% survival rate then fine; but please don't delude yourself into thinking you're the one thinking things through clearly here. Taking these things is pure idiocy unless you're in the ultra-high risk group.</p>

        <p>The vaccines could literally kill everyone who takes them over a period of a few years. </p>
<p>I only need to assign a probability of 0.1% or more to that turn of events to realise I shouldn't take them. And I assign a substantially higher than 0.1% probability to that turn of events. Pathogenic priming is a thing; it occurred with all previous attempts at these types of injections and could easily occur with these because...you know...they skipped the animal testing to check on that. Immune escape is a thing (look up Marek's disease), and there is a theory that vaccinated people will be more vulnerable to even minor mutations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the idea that they haven't killed plenty of people so far is laughable...without mentioning thousands upon thousands of severe reactions.</p>

        <p>Please provide a source on mRNA vaccines killing a single person. You can’t make these claims without a source. 
Also you say you worry about the vaccines long term side effects. Covid is known to have severe long term side effects: Chronic fatigue, loss of taste and smell, blood clots, losing teeth. COVID could also cause instant death and paralysis in 10 years if you would like to devolve into WHAT IFS. </p>
<p>Fact of the matter is with the current knowledge we have right now the vaccine is Infinitely safer than leaving yourself exposed to covid. Over half of American adults had it and we’re fine. Many who weren’t so fortune and got covid died a painful death alone without their families.</p>

        <p>VAERS shows thousands of deaths and tens of thousands of adverse reactions. and VAERS is known to only catch a tiny % of reactions.</p>
<p>And no, there is a substantial difference in speculating between long-term effects of a virus that your immune system has beaten naturally - which means it's gone - and speculating on random new technology which turns your body into a spike-protein factory. The odds that the virus has any unknown long-term consequences is virtually zero; the odds that the vaccine does is orders of magnitude higher.</p>

        <p>You’re just making shit up. Where is the source to “thousands of deaths caused by vaccine?” Obviously you’re lying being the CDC would have paused those vaccines. They put a pause on Johnson and Johnson because ONE person died, possibly as a result of the vaccine. And no there is a huge difference. As of now we know the vaccine is safe to get for everyone. As of now we know you could die if you catch covid no matter you’re age. The idea that a virus could have no long term side effects is completely insane. <a href="https://watermark.silverchair.com/53-1-10.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAqgwggKkBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKVMIICkQIBADCCAooGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQM8JTvJ0f6C_JlEeNkAgEQgIICW-3dLNFGnQDzd_cNcsPC3aYTJB5dFH2G0HK7wP8hyrvmFaHpqngC35kx_suKDmZ9ElintzCFAoepWsx7uRY16OiOaBIp3VJUAMc2nUsjmULghPI1k5eDkdJ-0ROVAK2DhEZ4_y7EbV3E0VpQjJ8J8ENDAOt5PiVy13LlOpDPiR7Dr8MGg9j63tZxj5EWd8njYkBTfI5VXXJhPqePzp28Fi-D1WXQTRT3YYQGroP7ueua0pQOv5p0GB4K0qNwqNCKKnOcuNnweAikgSzZYswlMLTdDP4z04tjjOu2IoKxVUPNO1qQpHImjTx6XYKM6e7LzNAHSWZ7ABIqcbR9UclZayeGsqSlYsi3mXL1E0VypvyyZp8Ky7K7AN7gnw3-vgGEsnHTeANyWU2YRS4vPBO80GrRe2UesvLJakirvG5s9fHM7LoxKX_IVYHgRJ2lWAc0uDhZHPLFrW16o9cUaygcEe_cfyWguYmEjoainaPm8EyIJBOJuapheLqdW2pN6A3aBJz2BjyIWdP9_ErjWtJqidW8pqc30WEXleIwjw-dyRXMUfGvXPr07jjhIIfmF1MLV-R-_-LNeG0CTxcHRuEuG6HgxAutOOjV-2kmtiguXCOhDBHmVnHjxPwdujjYUgI4wKhWYrDq3Vxp8oP2xvdnLFDxJjKrp2FsjIG_wF5pgbNq-kmfLurNpOc1mboq7v0l1O_Vt59H5-XbO_IpirvW6V5ppPPQrPIw2edq40qjm1k58cgU0w_ceRrqzdA_RRUnZHGu2SfdqSwOnbh7pSQbdJPdMUh6VOwAf6UMHw">here is my source</a></p>

        <p>Millions of people have been vaccinated by now. I am one of them. I had Covid in October 2020. Took the vaccine in January, since I'm a healthcare worker and it was available to us. You're fearmongering about the vaccine when you people complain that the media fearmongered about covid. You're being a hypocrite if you think it's wrong to fearmonger, just look at yourselves.</p>

        <p>Here's your problem: you look at everything in terms of sides, even though I admitted earlier that I think many government recommendations are absurd such as masking outdoors (vaxxed or unvaxxed). I think it's absurd to make people continue to wear a mask when they've been vaccinated or have a documented case of having had Covid-19 and beaten it. I don't want anyone to be an extremist. I am especially against fascism of all forms.
What I support is common sense, and to me that includes taking vaccines. Imagine if people were so stupid and pushed conspiracies back when they were trying to eradicate smallpox, polio, measles, etc..... Well, now we don't have to because measles is trying to make a comeback, and who knows what's next? How can you say covid deaths are a fake government conspiracy, but vaccine deaths are real? It's hypocrisy to me. I would take a 3rd and 4th vaccine if that's what it takes to convince people that there is nothing different or worse about mRNA than any other kind of vaccine.</p>

        <p>Google "pfizer criminal history." Go on. Do it. And look at the source.</p>
<p>Your blanket trust for Big Pharma doesn't make sense given their long criminal history. It's not just Pfizer. It's all of them. It's what happens when you link profits and peoples health.</p>
<p>It's like blindly trusting a particularly money obsessed mechanic. He'll find endless repairs for your car, to line his pockets.</p>

<p>And your obsession with vaccines is overrated, by the way. Do you understand evolution? It goes like this... </p>
<p>We evolve. Viruses evolve. But if our evolution requires that we take vaccines in order to survive, and you guys successfully push vaccines on everyone which is quite literally your goal... Then eventually our species will RELY on vaccines in order to survive.</p>
<p>While Big Pharma would love that, it's not what's best for our species. </p>
<p>Instead, allowing people to reject the vaccines you push means humans can continue to evolve and survive.</p>
<p>The threat of Covid-19 is exaggerated. </p>
<p>My family isn't taking your Covid-19 vaccine. We don't need it. Our immune systems will protect us just fine, thanks, and my kids will pass strong genes down to their kids.</p>
<p>Your obsession with vaccines is just leading our species toward a path of pathetic weakness and government reliance.</p>
<p>But hey, there are 6 of us in my family and we're skipping this vaccine. That leaves 6 more for you to take.</p>
<p>So go on, hero, take them!  Take them all! lol</p>

        <p>Dude, I would literally be willing to listen to you if you didn't treat the phrase "anti-vaxxer" like it's the fucking "n" word and keep calling it "your" vaccine. Lol, it's not my vaccine. I don't work for Pfizer or Moderna or J&amp;J or any of them. You seem like you're just trying to push me out of the group rather than educate me as to why I should be on the side of NoNewNormal's theory.</p>
<p>Also, nothing negative about the phrase "government conspiracy." I actually do believe the government is capable of corrupt, evil actions. I've just yet to be persuaded as to how covid was orchestrated to protect capitalism and government interests.</p>
<p>I actually like your post that highlighted a Trump executive order as a likely beginning of government vaccine efforts because it showed me you're not a brainwashed Trump-supporting fascist.</p>

        <p>Actually, I apologize for being a jerk. And -- I took a step back with realization that you aren't what I assumed.</p>
<p>I probably need to get off NNN. I've spent a year fighting with people every day about this stuff and just... a few days ago I was just done with these people.</p>
<p>I made assumptions of you and you got caught in the crossfire, and I apologize.</p>
<p>"NoNewNormal" doesn't really have a theory. It's just an amalgamation of a bunch of people, all different types.</p>
<p>I wasn't right to respond in a way that would push anyone out. We just get people constantly that are basically trolls and I think some of us see NNN as kind of an escape from what we get elsewhere.</p>
<p>And yeah, Trump. Oh boy. What's happening now was planned. He was part of it, yeah.</p>
<p>I have a project I'm doing where I'm making a timeline to put all the little "coincidences" together. After a while you realize they aren't coincidences -- there too many.</p>
<p>I reacted to the word "conspiracy theorist" because it's normally used to discredit people. Once someone is called that, they're discredited. You don't have to listen to their warnings because they're "crazy" etc.</p>
<p>The "fascism" thing is funny though. If you read about fascism you'll find an interesting history where Mussolini came up by merging government and corporate interests. It's where we are now, in a way.</p>
<p>So the Big Pharma + Big Tech + Government relationship really does look like economic fascism.  Mussolini was considered far right, but what we're seeing now isn't actually "left." </p>
<p>Democrats are "fake progressives" just like most Republicans are "fake conservatives."  And yes, even Bernie is a fake.  The last year made that clear. </p>
<p>At a time when he should have been pushing for healthcare reform he was pushing for masks and social distancing, and his entire role in the Democratic party was to excite progressives and then transfer their support to Biden. He played that role knowingly.</p>
<p>ugh</p>

        <p>Apology accepted! I really appreciate that. And like, everything you just said, that's the stuff I can get behind. Both parties have proven they're incapable of representing the interests of the people. Also, yeah, I swear I'm not a troll. Reddit recommended a post to me from this group, can't remember which one, but I do remember laughing at it. </p>
<p>Then, however, I saw things in this group that I disagreed with, but I genuinely thought, hey, let me just engage in a little discourse/debate. I seriously just wanted to submit my perspective as someone who both tested positive for covid19 and someone who took the vaccine. It's hard to accept that you've been a pawn in a corporatist, fascist government conspiracy, but I swear I'm willing to listen and learn.</p>

        <p>Oh, I always wondered how people ended up in here...</p>
<p>Okay so the list of questionable things about Covid-19 and the response to it is virtually endless. As you dig into it, you'll find it's a rabbit hole. At some point you have to say, "Hmm... At what point are these not 'coincidences anymore?'"</p>
<p>But because there are questions, we don't even have to go there. Consider this:</p>
<p>If you increase the competition of ideas - truth will emerge. </p>
<p>What does it mean when one side uses propaganda, fear, and censorship to silence dissent? They do so because their side will not hold up in a rational debate of logic and reason. </p>
<p>Simple as that.</p>
<p>And that much we know. We know doctors and scientists and medical workers all over the world have tried to speak out. They get fired, blacklisted. They have their names trashed in the press so they can probably never work again. </p>
<p>We've had politicians investigated as a result of speaking out. (For example Scott Jenner, a lifelong medical doctor who was threatened with removal of his medical license for asking the wrong questions.)</p>
<p>And the censorship is extreme. Many of us have been banned all over the place even when we are rational. Actually, the more rational we are the more quickly we find ourselves banned. Sometimes they let the crazy stuff through because it makes us look "crazy."</p>
<p>I mean -- look at /r/maskskepticism for example.</p>
<p>And people say "Well, private companies can do what they want." Well, yeah. But Mussolini said the same thing, and government-corporate collusion is exactly how fascism came to be.  But is there collusion? We have a public senate hearing where a senator asks all the heads of every big tech company to censor "misinformation" and they all agree.</p>
<p>While the media says it's all to silence extremists and crazy people -- those people are only the justification. They aren't the target. Crazy people don't convince anyone or make a difference -- rational people do.</p>
<p>And rational people have been silenced left and right.</p>
<p>A most recent example is James Corbett's The Corbett Report being pulled off of YouTube. </p>
<p>Here's what got his channel cancelled:
https://www.corbettreport.com/sciencesays/</p>
<p>Watch that. Give it 30 minutes. Listen to the rational logic. Look in his show notes and see that he always gives links to back up everything he says.</p>
<p>He's not an extremist. He comes off more like a college professor. Cancelled. Doctors, scientists? Cancelled. Silenced.</p>
<p>Anyhow --- not even discussing the more questionable issues, we KNOW they are silencing people.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because their side doesn't hold up to logic and reason.</p>
<p>In history, the side that censors and silences dissent and tells people it's "for their safety" is never the good side.</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>And you can't say "but this time's different" because it's ALWAYS this way. This is the pattern. We're seeing it now.</p>
<p>It's quite similar to what we saw when the lie of "Weapons of Mass Destruction" was pushed to justify invasion of a country and a slaughtering of its people who had nothing to do with 9/11.   Remember the "daily terror alerts?"</p>
<p>They were politically motivated, and Tom Ridge, the head of Homeland Security, later came out and admitted it publicly. But no one cared because time had passed.</p>
<p>But ignore history and we are doomed to repeat it, as we are now...</p>

        <p>Doesn't have anything to do with fear. I refuse to take part in a medical experiment. Safety tests are still underway (depending on the vaccine ~2022-2023). I'll wait till that data is out. </p>
<p>I'm not in a risk group, the chances of me being hospitalized or getting seriously Ill are so small I really don't feel the need to take the stuff. But go on and call me a "anti-vaxxer". </p>
<p>That constant push (everywhere) to get everyone vaccinated is sickening. Why not only the risk groups? Why does everyone young and old needs to get it? As it stands the vaccines only prevent you getting seriously Ill. You can still get it, you van still transmit it. I really don't see the need for me to get it right now. But you do you.</p>

        <p>Thanks! Lol, I do think it was crazy they expected people wear masks outdoors, though. So I'm not totally against what the group stands for. I just don't support anti-vaxxers.</p>

        <p>Lol, first time for everything 🤷🏻‍♀️ just because you weren't always anti-vax doesn't mean you never can be. It seems to me you've had a change of heart, so yeah, I'd say you're anti-vax for not trusting science and the doctors behind this vaccine. Where does it end? Who will lose your trust next? No one is immune from conspiracy theories, not even you or me.</p>

But again, I will say, the mask wearing should come to an end, but only if people are willing to accept that there is nothing weird with the vaccine(s)</p>

        <p>They flip flop from everybody needs to be vaccinated for it to work, to you can still catch and spread COVID while vaccinated, to it stops symptoms, not the spread, back to... but everybody needs it.  And still wear a mask.</p>
