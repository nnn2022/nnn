        <p>Yes i truly believe that it is getting blown up because the democrats see him as a huge threat 2024. This whole mask mandate thing is a pointless argument. If he said you cant wear mask i would not agree. But he has literally left it up to business and parents (for school kids) to decide. Every news outlet that is running the increase in Florida hospitals dont seem to mention that we have a huge tourist population right now and alot of these cases are probably from out of state people who sat in their house for a year and decided to go to Florida for vacation. After spring break there was a spike and the country blamed Florida yet i know no one who lives in Florida that partakes in spring break events. Same as going to theme parks in the summer. Its all one sided to make Desantis the new big bad trump its nonsense</p>

        <p>Yep, I went to the beach last weekend. Plates I saw at the bay in Cape San Blas: Pennsylvania, Indiana, Georgia, Louisiana, New York, New Jersey, Tennessee. The only Florida plates were the people taking their boat out. Loads of tourists.</p>

        <p>100% YES - if not for DeSantis I believe the entire US would be like NYC, MI, CA wastelands because other Red Gov's have followed his lead. As for Florida we are FREE because of Ronny D. </p>
<p>If he continues to rise thru the ranks and he stops this Covid madness by somehow getting thru to the White House despite the inevitable election fraud that will attempt to stop him, I don't think it will be a stretch to one day say "DeSantis Saves the World".</p>

        <p>Here's one thing people fail to think about with Florida: you get a bunch of snowbirds who come down from NY, NJ, or just the New England area in general for the winter and they vote the same way they do back at home. The views of most Floridans don't reflect them.</p>

        <p>I agree with what he does when it comes to Covid. He is giving people the option to choose for themselves. We all know people who get the vaccine can still get and transmit the disease. If I want to take my chances without it that‚Äôs my choice. I work in health care around Covid patients pretty much everyday I work. I don‚Äôt trust the vaccine, I do trust my immune system since health care workers usually have a tougher immune response than the general public.</p>

        <p>I like how he is handling it so far. </p>
<p>I only have 3 other residencies on my street and can say that the one house is very mistrustful of the government and this whole pandemic mess. They are older and do not trust the vaccine. They are taking care of an even older mother of the husband. Mom is on dialysis and the husband has issues of his own. Back and forth from the doctor's at least every week. I spoke to him the other day and he mentioned that he will not get the shot because he believes that the government and the pharmaceutical companies do not have our best interests in mind. The woman volunteers at the community center and the guy plays music with a band almost every week so I assume that they get along with plenty of like-minded people. That couple are the ones I am closest with but I often keep to myself. Usually we just chat for a few minutes when I walk the dog and cats. </p>
<p>Next door neighbors from NJ seem like they are living life normally. They do not seem concerned about covid but that is all I know. They are young folks.</p>
<p>I am not sure about the other residence. Older folks and seem like private people. </p>
<p>One lady around the corner has had the shot and  seems like she was persuaded to do it because she has health problems, yada yada. She seems unafraid of covid because she is vaxxed. Knows that my family and I chose not to vax but it doesn't affect our acquaintance any. (We both care for some abandoned stray cats we had fixed in the area so usually only talk about our missing ones or those that have been killed.)
She says a friend wishes that everyone would get it because she keeps getting covid over and over despite having the shot. Has a bad immune response or something. You know how it goes...</p>
<p>However, I can not speak for others because I don't get out much. </p>
<p>Last Walmart trip I saw about 50/50 masked when a month ago it was more like 25%.</p>
<p>Local grocery: Some employees wear masks but some have them on the neck so I think some of it is a show. Lol</p>
<p>Local ACE hardware were the first store I noticed that dropped the masks as soon as they could. I feel like mask wearing might even be looked down upon. Just a vibe I get. </p>
<p>Seems pretty relaxed here to me. </p>
<p>I am from S. FL and reside in N. FL where some folks still have Trump flags and signs. Sometimes I even see a truck with big flags flying. Haha</p>
<p>This place seems like a whole different country than S. FL where I am from. I imagine things are quite different in some big towns. </p>
<p>Alachua county nearby called for some kind of emergency where they couldn't tell anyone to do anything, but made it known anyway. They want more people to get the shot. Guess it gets some funds or something.</p>

        <p>Floridians who agree with his policy have a small majority, but they are pretty quiet. Those who disagree are loud and obnoxious.</p>
<p>However, make no mistake about it. DeSantis is a part of the system. He is actively working to increase vaccine uptake while still maintaining his hero image.</p>
<p>For the upcoming school year, masks are optional, but quarantining is not for unvaxed students.</p>
<p>If you're a vaccinated student in contact with a case, you do not need to miss school unless you have symptoms.  If you're unvaxed, you will miss a week.</p>
<p>It may not seem like much, but this is a huge incovenience for famlies and students working towards scholarships. This is diabolic and coercive.</p>

        <p>I know that changing schools is a real inconvenience but sometimes it is for the better. Is it possible that there are private schools that do not contact trace as much as other schools? Maybe get one of those vouchers? Could the contact tracing be one of the things that is considered harassment?</p>
<p>This was a concern for me last year even though there was no shot for kids. I simply pulled my kid from school and am homeschooling because I was worried about a possible vaccine drive, general craziness, contact tracing, and zoom invasions of our privacy during that virtual school time in quarantine. Just nope to all that. My kid wanted to homeschool for years anyway so that kinda pushed it through. </p>
<p>Kid's friends missed a lot of school because of possible exposures where they never even got sick. I am aware that some kids might milk this for all that it is worth if like my kid, they dislike school. </p>
<p>If my kid was working toward a scholarship, it would probably be a whole different story. That just sucks.</p>
<p>I guess I feel like having the freedoms we do are better than none, and better than a lot of places.</p>
<p>Now if they would just stop the contact tracing and kids having to stay home when they are not even sick...</p>
