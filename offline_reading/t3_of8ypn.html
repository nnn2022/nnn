    <strong>Why should a bone and joint surgeon care about vaccine status?</strong>
    <p><p>This is mostly a rant so sorry if it’s long but it’s a frightening situation I thought I should share. My mom broke her wrist a few days ago, went to the ER and they referred her to a specialized surgeon. We get in today and the surgeon comes in, everything’s friendly, nothing to worry about. Then he asks her AND me if we’ve gotten the vaccine, we both just say we already had covid and have natural immunity but he keeps pushing. He starts ranting about how even if you’ve had covid then you can be a “super spreader and not even know it” he then tells us we both need to get it because “it’s just the right thing to do” and started pushing variant fear porn and said unvaccinated people are “a danger to themselves and others” because “the variants are serious”. I just sat there shocked but he leaves right after that. A few minutes later he comes in and asks what her job is (she’s a sign language teacher/special ed teacher). So he uses this to pressure her into surgery FOR TOMORROW because “she’s never going to be able to sign again” “her signing career is over” etc if she doesn’t get his surgery, so naturally she started crying a little bit and then rushed her to sign the forms. He then goes on to explain the surgery super quickly but veers into the direction of all the things that could go wrong without us asking. “Theres a major artery there that is really difficult to fix if I cut it” “It’s possible I damage some tendons” the whole time he was talking about this he had a fucking smirk on his face. Then he asks about her allergies in which she said she’s allergic to penicillin. But since she couldn’t describe her symptoms very well(she hasn’t taken it for a long time) he said “well we’re going to use a derivative of it after the surgery” She then reaffirms that she’s allergic to ALL cillins and all he said was “well that’s what we use, a lot of people say they are allergic but actually aren’t”. So at this point I finally step in and say “no, I know you have alternatives that would be much safer for her” to which he snidely replies “we’ll see what can be done” rolls his eyes and walks out of the room. I can’t emphasize enough how much different the tone was after he found out we weren’t vaccinated. I should also add that he said he’s “not sure” whether he will require her to be vaccinated before the surgery. At best he had some animosity and at worst I fear he was trying to fucking kill her. Needless to say we are getting a second opinion</p></p>

        <p>please for the love of God report him to the medical board and find a new surgeon... he doesn’t sound like he would actually put care into the surgery plus the fact he spouted all that nonsense just speaks on his ineptitudes</p>

        <p>it would be the best thing to do... and tell your mom he may have used fear to push a quick surgery but it sounds like she would be worse off in his care than if she holds out for another surgeon</p>

        <p>It wasn’t really the pushing of the vaccine that was my main worry although he did do that but nothing more than what the MSM does. What worried me is how his bias would affect the safety of the surgery. It almost seemed like he wanted vengeance or something but obviously that’s just a gut feeling. I guess that goes to show how little I trust these people</p>

        <p>Agree with everyone on here. First job for every doctor is to respect the patient, then do everything they can to treat the patient within those confines.</p>
<p>A doctor that places bias above doing his or her job is dangerous and should be avoided. Who knows what reason they would come up with to intentionally botch a procedure even if subconsciously…</p>

        <p>That’s a really good way to put it, I’m going to report him tomorrow. It’s terrifying that someone who has your life in their hands will gladly put their political beliefs ahead of the safety of the patient, or even worse feel morally correct in doing so. I really got the impression he would at the very least subconsciously botch it</p>

        <p>Do not let him touch your mother. I believe he’s getting kickbacks from vaccine referrals. I’m not kidding. I had a similar bizarre experience with my rheumatologist. She sounded like an evangelist when talking about the vaccine and made me feel like a piece of shit because I’m unvaccinated. After talking to a few people I heard that a lot of doctors are getting pressure from the hospitals where they are affiliated to get people vaccinated. Please do not take your mother back to this clown. I would not trust him to perform surgery on a green pepper!</p>

        <p>Interesting, now I’m trying to think of ways to find this out because that would be great information to have, even better if I could find out which medical professionals are getting the most kickback. The post was getting long and it was starting to lag and this is probably insignificant so I didn’t mention it but he also was making her get a Covid and Mersa test right away, telling us to cancel another appointment we had shortly after just to do it which I thought was weird because they never asked for any tests before the pandemic for surgeries and idek why it would matter unless he doesn’t use proper PPE lol so maybe he’s being incentivized?</p>

        <p>I don't know where you're writing from, but here in the UK that would be totally unacceptable. You can't be forced to take the vaccine in order to be operated, nobody will"tell you off" if you don't take it, penicillin WON'T ever be given to those who report allergy to it and the overall attitude you describe can easily lead to a formal complaint.</p>

        <p>I used to think it would be unacceptable here in the U.S. too, I think that’s why I was so shocked and didn’t speak up when I should’ve, from now on I’m definitely going to be on high alert</p>

        <p>People do very often outgrow penicillin allergies. But he is a dick, but honestly with surgeries who cares if he is as long as he's real good at his job. Not bedside manner good but making sure her injury heals in the best way possible. Vs. nice bedside manner and an average surgeon.</p>

        <p>She stated in the beginning it was a family allergy, I’m allergic, her moms allergic so he had no right to question it. And he was actually kinda nice in the beginning but turned into a huge dick after he found out we weren’t vaccinated but otherwise I would agree you. I don’t give a shit how people act as long as they act like that consistently without obvious bias</p>

        <p>The obvious bias is a big issue, as is his attitude - the smirking while talking about potentially fatally injuring OP's mother, and the rolling of the eyes at the mention of a drug allergy. Bias can subconsciously affect how he would perform during surgery, along with his "fuck you" attitude towards his patient. If you dont care if your patient lives or dies, youre not going to try as hard in surgery on them, as you are on someone that you respect. Consciously or subconsciously, either or.</p>

        <p>You should have shut him up when when he started ranting about COVID. Told him to stay on topic, a broken wrist has absolutely nothing to do with COVID. Should have asked him straight to his face if he's requiring vaccination because you and you mom 100% aren't going to get it, and you'll move on with another surgeon.</p>
