    <strong>The Reporting of "Total Cases" by a Country, Region, State, Province, County, City, etc. is Extremely Egregious</strong>
    <p><p>We're entering in the 7th or 8th month of this pandemic in most of the western world and sites like google and most public health websites show, front and center, total cases from the beginning with how much they've increased each day. How can there be any other use of this metric other than to spread fear? Wouldn't an accurate measure be "active cases" because those are the ones you may actually get the disease from? </p>

<p>I actually live in a pretty open county in an open state but people on facebook keep posting that our county is blowing up with cases because google and our state's covid dashboard display total cases and daily increase as the display metric  and you have to dig to find active cases. We have friends and family in lockdown land that won't come here because "cases are going up!" In actuality, we've been hovering around 200-350 active cases in a county of 100k people for 3 months. It's over 600 sq miles and mostly rural too. We have no public transportation and not many big office buildings either. The chance of getting it here is minuscule and dying from it is even smaller but each day that total number goes up and someone blasts it out on FB and everyone is begging for lockdown. It's disgustingly disingenuous to track and display cases this way because the only thing it does is propagate fear.</p></p>
