    <strong>This scamdemic made me realize that most people are liars</strong>
    <p><p>This scamdemic made me realize that most people are just liars</p>
<p>Most of them lie about the dangers of covid</p>
<p>Most of them lie about why you need to wear a mask</p>
<p>Most of them only believes what the mainstream media is telling them everything else is false</p>
<p>Liars always keep listening to other liars to feel comfortable and will also protect the lie no matter what.</p>
<p>Liars will also silence everyone that tells the truth just so the liars can fool everyone they are telling the truth</p>
<p>Liars will try anything to convince you to trust the vaccine but will hate you when you question it</p>
<p>Liars don't like people that question things so they silence you for questioning </p>
<p>Liars will even lie about your death just so they don't contradict themselves </p>
<p>Liars will ignore to look at the proofs/evidence because they hate the truth. </p>
<p>I'm not calling them sheeps anymore at this moment they are just liars </p>
<p>A sheep follows the herd because they are not conscious about the lie</p>
<p>A liar knows it's a lie and will keep acting like it's truth to try to convince people they are the ones telling the truth </p>
<p>A liar loves to decide what's true or false for the individuals </p>
<p>We are dealing with liars not sheeps.</p></p>

        <p>Most are lying to themselves as well as others. They canâ€™t handle the truth, either because they were not raised right or they operate out of fear and hatred. The world is broken and thatâ€™s how it always will be. Gotta keep your chin up and see the positives. Donâ€™t let them live in your head rent free</p>

        <p>I also think some lie because theyâ€™re scared weâ€™re right and they just played themselves. They got so caught up in chasing trends and virtue signaling that they now have in them a foreign fluid that will be with them forever and could cause some truly horrific complications down the line. Rather then consider that, they damn and curse us because we didnâ€™t do the same.</p>

        <p>There's a distinction, I think, between 'liar' and 'ideologue.' </p>
<p>To be a liar, you have to <em>know</em> that the information is incorrect and spread it anyway. For sure the MSM, fauci, and governments, that applies.</p>
<p>But for your average person on the street.... well, the best comparison i can draw is a hard-core Catholic. "If the church says the sky is green, then it is green, and it is a sin to look up. Good people see it as green, and I'm afraid that if I look up, I will be betraying my faith and become a Bad Person by doing so. Besides, we're all just trying to spread the word and get everyone into heaven."</p>

<p>That example makes sense, but I do see that as lying too because when you act in that way you become the liar too to show everyone you're on the good side because you're afraid to look bad and you become addicted to listening to the bigger liars.</p>

        <p>Like I said, it's a fine distinction, but growing up around hyper religious people, they actually think what they're saying is the truth. Being fervent and wrong is different from lying. And if you're talking to the former as if they know that what they're saying is untrue, they can immediately dismiss it because they truly believe what they're saying</p>
