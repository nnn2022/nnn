        <p>Hahaha pile up more money? She's fucking there to make more money haha .. also she was on vacation so she wasn't there to be exposed and the employers do not have to tell her another employee has covid if there was no chance of contamination.. and I'm sure they sanitized the desk. Wtf people have lost their fucking minds.</p>
<p>So .. what if the company decided to close down and stopped paying her? Then she will be bitching about not having any work and how the government has to help her... Guess what government hasn't helped small businesses during this thing. One fucking loan and the second loan you didn't get unless you can prove you lost over 20% revenue from last year.. </p>
<p>so get this shit ..  the first loan PPP and SBA for small business was tied to not firing people and not going out of business so basically you couldn't lose money, couldn't not pay bills in order to have the loan forgiven at the end of 2020. Then the second loan, 2021, you can't qualify for if you didn't lose 20% revenue (which you're fucking bankrupt and out of business at that point) haha who's fucking running this place? A bunch of people that have no idea how the fucking real world works that's who.</p>
