        <p>The crazy thing is... children didn't use to commit suicide before social media. This is a phenomenon that has just recently started to happen within the last 10 years or so. I mean some kids may have, but the number and trend didn't increase exponentially every year until after social media</p>

        <p>Actually, children under the age of 10 didn't really ever do that. It was extremely uncommon, I'm talking preadolescence. Adolescence to teens and adults are a different story. kids are doing this before fully developing now</p>

        <p>I didn't link any sources? I just remember reading a paper for one of my classes a year or 2 ago I had to write about for a research paper. Don't ask me what it was because I can't remember that far back lol but I was like dang kids killing themselves now. also I totally get thinking anyone under 18 is a kid lmao I call anyone under 21 a kid to be honest</p>

        <p>"Epoch Times...</p>
<p>CCP virus...</p>
<p>Come on guys this article is trash. The virus being less deadly to younger people has been known from the start, that's why they fought so hard to re-open the schools LAST YEAR. This isn't a revelation. This claim has also been made about people under 30, right? So the same thing must apply to them?</p>
<p>It also completely fails to link any of the suicides to anything. They give no reason why more younger people are doing it. Should we jump to conclusions and say it's because they don't like sitting in their houses? When the narrative about children for years was they need to be forced outside more because they're lazy and play video games? Are we going to jump to conclusions that it's because they haven't seen their friends? When technology has made it even easier for communication between these people to still exist? Weren't we only saying that children spend too much time on their phones talking to friends? Are we going to jump to conclusions and say that it was because of domestic abuse which is more likely to happen when families face each other more during lockdown? If thats the case, is that really the fault of the virus that families are struggling to spend time with each other?</p>
<p>I have friends that have committed suicide over the past 15 months, due to different complex and unexplainable reasons and yes admittedly one did take his own life because of the thought of being in constant lockdown - which he couldn't cope with because of the idiots refusing to take any personal responsability about their actions and continued to push this pandemic to unmanageable proportions, by refusing to even do the basics of masking up and socially distancing.</p>
<p>And in the article they mention it is not peer reviewed - reference to the claim that children are less likely to develop life altering symptoms. It even downplayed half of the childrens deaths with the "with, not of" bullshit. This data has changed now with variants. </p>
<p>Terrible article that says nothing more than children are less likely to die from coronavirus, while trying to unsuccessfully link suicide cases to lockdowns. It is disgusting that mental health and anyone that suffers from it has been used as a reason to fight against public safety, especially when idiots say "I would rather save a 22 year old suffering from depression than an 85 year old with dementia". It shouldn't have to be a fucking choice and shit articles like this make it seem like it is. </p>
<p>Another friend commited suicide because he couldn't handle the fact people disregarded his grandad as a disposable life because of his medical condition, all because of this shit mentality that's being pushed by anti-lockdowns idiots who can't think of anyone else but themselves, but the article doesn't mention that. It doesn't mention the strain caused by anti-vaxers, inconsiderate people, people who would rather shout at him for wearing a face muzzle and call him a sheep while keeping people safe in the ICU wards. It doesn't mention he was a kind and considerate person who never felt he was enough and was pushed to the edge because of the grave reality that people were happy his grandad died, to add to the statistics so that anti-lockdown protesters could use his nameless death to push their own selfish stance as to why they don't need to be cautious? No, it was obviously the lockdowns and the fact he couldn't get a haircut.</p>
<p>It's disgusting and anyone trying to assume reasons behind people's mental health, from an epochtimes article should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

        <p>Yup and even if total suicides didn't increase, we knoe for a fact in the US that suicide attempts were up due to COVID restrictions, especially for teen girls</p>
<p>See this:https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/06/11/suicide-attempts-among-young-girls-surge-by-more-than-50percent-during-pandemic-cdc-says-.html?__twitter_impression=true</p>

        <p>First link.
"The increase in suspected suicide attempts by young people could be attributed to social distancing, including a lack of connection to schools, teachers and friends. Other factors could include barriers to mental health treatment, an increase in substance abuse, and anxiety about the health and economic state of the family at home."</p>
<p>I think that proves that there is more involved than the black and white "lockdowns" you're so desperate to pin everything on. It's called context. Every persons situation is complex and messy and that article did a great job in pointing out the nuance between the boogyman you call "lockdown" and the actual reasons why people struggle with it. The longer you drag this out, the harder you make it for these teens you so righteously fight to protect. The answer isn't "end lockdowns" in some arrogant "one answer fits all" bullshit, it's breaking down WHY people struggled with lockdowns and addressing them accordingly. Also that article only states possibilities, but at least it gives more thought to the situation other than "lockdowns are killing teenagers" like the narrative is pushed here.</p>
<p>Should I try the dismissive tactic of "died with, not of" and downplay that article by saying "It was attempts, not actual suicides" or should I point out it states reasons as to why people, especially younger ones, struggle with the reality of "lockdowns"? Or did you just read the headline and nothing further than the first advertisement?</p>
<p>Second article. This one again at least tries to give some context, that you refuse to acknowledge or even consider you might play an active part in by prolonging the length of time we have to fight against the pandemic.</p>
<p>"SocialÂ isolationÂ during the pandemic can push youngsters with underlyingÂ mental healthÂ issues "over the edge," Jolly said in a Penn State Health news release.
Other factors include family dysfunction and long amounts of forced time with others. Even children in so-called healthy families can feel overwhelmed.Â Anxiety about pandemic shutdown-related financial struggles, constant bad news and health-related worries can also transfer from parents to children."</p>
<p>The article didn't say lockdowns are causing suicides. The article states suicide attempts have risen due to the complications surrounding lockdowns. Again, thank you for supporting my comment that we need to address the complexity of issues causing mental health problems and not pin this on the blanket term of "lockdowns". How can you dismiss a covid death due to previous health conditions but teenagers with underlying mental health conditions are fine?</p>
<p>Third:
"We are all coping with multiple stressors brought on by the current pandemic,"
"We must be attentive to the unique impact of these stressors on children and youth depending on their stage of development."</p>
<p>and...</p>
<p>"The hospital says the reasons for the increase are unclear, but the shared hypotheses from hospital professionals and literature cites a combination of factors, such as isolation, risk of over exercising, limited or no school, or limited access to family physicians in the earlier part of the pandemic, as well activities where teachers and coaches would notice changes in health."</p>
<p>And...</p>
<p>"McMaster Children's Hospital says mental health challenges during the pandemic can be a result of:</p>
<p>Increased isolation and boredom.</p>
<p>Lack of day-to-day structure.</p>
<p>Family tension due to more time spent at home.</p>
<p>Anxiety related to attending school in-person or virtually.</p>
<p>Limited access to doctors, teachers, coaches and peers who may notice changes in health.</p>
<p>Additional stress due to systemic racism."</p>
<p>Which again agrees with everything I've said.</p>
<p>The irony is these websites are dismissed as unreliable when they don't fit your narrative. The irony is you only dismiss someone with an underlying health condition when they're old. The irony is you argue against the complexity of mental health by linking websites that agree with me.
The irony is you refuse to take responsability as to why these problems continue to get worse.</p>

        <p>You have friends that committed suicide because of the fear of more lockdowns and your main thought process is "if these idiots just <em>locked down properly</em> no one would have to die!" Man, you're one gullible, heartless, son of a bitch, you know that? And stupid as hell to boot!</p>

        <p>Thank you for completely proving my point!!</p>
<p>Your response: 
"oh something bad happened? Let me tell you what really happened"
- is the epitome of this whole charade.</p>
<p>From scientific papers to messages from the heart, you cherry pick and force your own interpretation into the conversation. You just did it by heartlessly calling me gullible. </p>
<p>Oh your grandad died? Bet the hospital lied about the cause. </p>
<p>Oh you want to wear a mask? Bet you didn't consider breathing in your own viruses. </p>
<p>Oh you want to get the vaccine? Bet you didn't think about shedding. </p>
<p>And even now, when I can't write it any clearer, you still dispute it. You still can't accept the truth, that your actions have consequences and that personal responsability actually includes accountability. </p>
<p>I told you my story because I'm tired of suicides and mental health being used in this political arguement when none of you are advocating to advance help for these people, they're just used in a statistical war, nameless and disregarded. You make assumptions about his death like you did his grandads. All you show is arrogance and the inability to consider anything than from your own view.</p>
<p>I have been in this sub since march last year because I also wasn't happy with the way my government handled their response to coronavirus. I am very much aware that it has been a shitshow from the start. What hasn't helped is the conversation from very early on got hijacked by anarchists, wanting to burn everything down, refusing to see one race to help and said "well it doesn't bother me so fuck the people it does." People have and are still dying from this, people have and are still dealing with the long term effects of catching the virus, people have and still are dealing with the repercussions of job losses and company closes, people have and still are trying to manage the mental health problems that have been created and made worse and people have and still are downplaying every dangerous aspect of this pandemic. If that is something you are still struggling to comprehend maybe it is your own mental health you should be advocating to address.</p>
<p>I was there for my friends. I was there for the conspiracy-ridden ones and the ones scared to come out of their houses. I was there for the ones that lost family members and not once did I push my own agenda by saying "well ok your 35 yr old daughter died but I didn't like wearing masks so maybe we can agree to disagree."</p>
<p>I, like my friends, were not happy with the new normal that was being created. We realised the new normal is being created by the same people fighting against it, every single person in this subreddit. Vaccine passports, mask mandates and not one of you will stand up and say "ok with all things considered, maybe we did cause some of these problems we're so vocal agains't" no, never. Instead all you say is "sheep" in a way to ignore your own accountability, like you could ever consider how your actions actually affect them too.</p>
<p>Not only did you not do your bit to put the fire out, you actively mocked people that tried, you told lies about it not existing and downplayed not only the severity of the fire but that for the vast majority of people it doesn't even hurt. When we brought in safety measures like masks and vaccines, suddenly they are the problem and then for the next year let's argue, again and again and again about that instead of acknowledging how your own actions, again and again and again actually affected the current situation. </p>
<p>If you are able to read my previous comment and still come to a wrong assumption about my friends mental health, if you're willing to drag your feet and make this pandemic last longer and then still call me gullible without taking any accountability for the part you played, well we've just gone full circle and you've proved my first point again.</p>
<p>"Oh something bad happened? Let me tell you, without any detail or consideration to the reality we've face for the past 15 months, without any prior knowledge or education on the subject, what really happened."</p>
<p>Pathetic.</p>
