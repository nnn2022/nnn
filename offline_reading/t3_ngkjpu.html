    <strong>Respiratory here again. I'm fucken back</strong>
    <p><p>I work in healthcare and we are great at treating emergencies and stabilizing them. If I did get sick with an infection, of course I would seek help, but we must take care of ourselves in the first place. Modern societies are so damn unhealthy and it isn't by accident. If you get sick with covid, the only thing they will use to help you is O2. You have to have a healthy immune system, and if you do, you will likely not even get symptoms. If the cabal had put 1/100th of the lockdown/mask/vaccine effort in to making us more healthy...eating well, life coaches, subsidize healthy food etc, the problem would be solved for now and the future. They don't want that. They want sick sheep to eat cheap food like products. Awwww, fucking christ. I am so sick of this shit.</p></p>

        <p>This was never about eradicating a virus.  Why in hell would part of the response be pulling the medications that actually work if they didn't want sick and dying people as well as a terrified population?</p>

        <p>Yup.  My take is that it's primarily about politics- specifically transforming a system and normalizing an increased tyrannical role government can exert over individuals.</p>
<p>Big Pharma is playing along and its reward will be the windfall business created when a population is turned to hypochondriacs by terrorists who've assumed roles of political leadership abetted by media collusion.</p>

        <p>I agree. How about a gym on every corner including gyms with sports [hmmm I am old enough to remember when the Y was actually affordable to those who weren't middle class and above] and the open promotion of organic food. I told husband I have to have a supply of Ivermetic in the apt before I rejoin society due to my risk. I have hcq, zinc, vit C, a nebulizer, emergency albuterol but I want that one too. I have bad lungs. I know they will shrug their shoulders and ignore me when I beg them to get the Pulmicort out and Ivermetic. Seriously if I end up getting it, am I right they would tell me to shut up if I could talk at all? I know some here believe it's all a hoax, and I think it was EXAGGERATED to hell the numbers with false PCR but I still get scared of catching whatever SARS 2 they released. In this clown country where medical care is unaffordable and can bankrupt you, all the "We care about your health" stuff is utter BS. I never bought it. I've been down the chronic illness juggernaut to know, "Tough Luck kid" is the outcome of many health problems. I almost didn't make it a few times.</p>

        <p>Hey, you're right. It is not a hoax. I can say without a doubt that there is a new illness going around. 100%. Whether or not it was man made or not is another story and that probably doesn't make a big diff to you personally but, make no mistake, strange illness. I was able to get my doctor to prescribe pulmicort (1mg twice daily). I showed him the research and he couldn't deny me. That is one med that they can prescribe if they have balls, they won't get in trouble like they would with ivermectin and hcq. One thing that struck me right away, was the lack of folks with copd getting ill with covid. I have not seen one single person who is on budesonide get sick with covid, not even the most frail and elderly with compromised lungs. I saw one fella who needed a few liters of O2 for 3 days and that was the most critical I've seen anyone. I also have a friend who works at the biggest facility in the southwest and he reports the same. Budesonide must be protective against the cytokines. In vitro, it blocks most of the interlukin molecules and reducses ace 2 and much of the same is seen in vivo. It worked will against the original sars virus. It is a crime that all old and obese people aren't just prescribed prophylactically. It works. Get yourself some!</p>

        <p>Im going to ask this doctor for pulmicort.  I am on Brovana for COPD.  I was trying to look up if it is related to Budesonide but didn't get an answer yet. It's supposed to drop inflammation in the lungs. I read too that it Budesonide had some protective quality. I did not get COPD from smoking-never have- severe asthma and autoimmune.
I had a friend with COPD get Covid and she shook it off like a cold, that surprised me. I don't know what drugs she is on for it though. I could ask the doctor for standing budesonide. I think they should have drugs preordered for the most fragile and old too.</p>

        <p>Pulmicort is the generic name for budesonide...same thing. If you have copd, they're is no way they can deny you. I'd get symbicort, but my insurance denied me so my only option was straight pulmicort nebs. The nebulizers are way cheaper. I pay $10 for a months supply. The symbicort is an inhaler so it's more convenient but also very expensive...as much as hundreds per month.  Just get the nebulizers and don't be afraid to tell the doctor you want it for your copd as well as for protection against covid. It's easy enough to find some data on studies you could show the doc.</p>
