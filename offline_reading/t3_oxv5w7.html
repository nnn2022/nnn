    <strong>Excerpt from "The Great Influenza", a book about the 1918 Spanish Flu, about how useless masks were then and are now written in 2004</strong>
    <p><p>&rt;<strong>"Surgical masks are next to useless except in very limited circumstances, chiefly in the home. Putting a mask on someone sick is most effective because it will contain droplets otherwise expelled into the roomâ€” a fact that experiments in 1918 proved.</strong> <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>Will a parent put a mask on a sick child and make that child more uncomfortable? Maybe, if he or she knows it will protect the rest of the family. And even a surgical mask when combined with rigorous hand washing may provide some protection for those in close contact with a sick person. N95 masks would be more appropriate in that situation and they do protect, but they need to be properly fitted and properly worn. This is harder than it sounds.</strong> <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>A study of professionals wearing N95s to protect themselves from toxic mold found that more than 60 percent did not wear them properly. In addition, they are extremely uncomfortable.</strong> <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong>For a few individuals and situations N95 masks may make sense, but for the general public over a period of weeks they do not."</strong><br>
&rt;<br>

        <p>There's no point for the general public to wear them, not because masks were inherently ineffective, but because people wore them incorrectly...</p>
<p>...maybe if we got people to wear masks correctly?</p>

        <p>It has to be a fitted N95 type mask to work. Not only that, you can only use the properly worn, fitted N95 for a short while before it must be replaced. The CDC has been telling people any cloth mask will do. That's useless. As the excerpt says, even professionals don't wear their N95 correctly half the time.</p>
<p>Mask mandates are hygiene theater. Their only purpose is to control public panic, not to slow down the virus.</p>
