Comparison of absolute with weight-adjusted cumulative doses proves administration ‚â•80 mg/kg of HCQ with &rt; 1 gm AZM increases survival in IMV-requiring Covid patients by over 100%.

        <p>I post this almost daily now; but only because it‚Äôs information that needs to be seen.</p>
<p>Sometimes a few people see it, sometimes it gets downvoted to the shadow realm for some reason.</p>
<p>But everything I‚Äôm saying here is fact and all my sources (except one) is from non-partisan sources. The link from a partisan source is just an example of that situation of which it‚Äôs talked about.</p>
<p>The TL;DR on everything (i get a little wordy here) is basically just going to say; ‚ÄúThe self-proclaimed ‚Äúparty of science‚Äù is nothing but a bunch of dickheads that really fucked up this world.‚Äù</p>
<p>To begin, what made doctors look to Hydroxychloroquine as an off label treatment? What is it?</p>
<p>First; HCQ has been one of the most prescribed drugs in the word for treatment against viruses and bacteria that attack the respiratory system for over 70 years.  It‚Äôs also one of the few drugs that have absolutely zero restrictions (meaning it‚Äôs safe for use by pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, elderly and even those with immune deficiencies). It was a natural choice to lead off with something that is incredibly safe, effective, decade‚Äôs of proven data and low cost!</p>
<p>Second; the NIH (under the direction of Fauci) supported and put out a study on the effectiveness of CQ against SARS-COV way back in 05. So turning to HCQ (it‚Äôs derivative) was a definite no brainier.</p>
<p>The first time HCQ was ever questioned for its effectiveness or safety (that I can find); was in 2020 when President Trump, duringa task force briefing said; ‚Äú[Chloroquine and its derivative, Hydroxychloroquine] showed unique promise as potentially effective treatments for Coronavirus‚Äù</p>
<p>That's all he said.  Nothing more... just a promising, but factual statement during a time when all of America was shitting their pants on this new global killer.  But after that statement, is when everyone started looking for reasons to hate on it, and that snowball started with Fauci,  one day after DJT said that during the meeting.</p>
<p>So what did they shit on HCQ for?  There were three primary reasons;</p>
<p>1.) ineffectiveness - meaning this didn‚Äôt work in every patient. Especially patients who were in the later stages of the effects of Covid and hospitalized. But patients who were treated in the earliest stages of Covid, had an incredibly high recovery rate (think it was in the mid-high 90%)</p>
<p>2.) dosage - As in, patients who received 1/2 to 1kilo of this drug, over the course of their lifetime, were prone to heart related issues.</p>
<p>Ok, that makes sense right? Too much of any drug can kill you.. Until you look at that number again‚Ä¶ 1/2 to 1kilo.</p>
<p>1 kilo = 1,000,000 milligrams.</p>
<p>Depending on the patient‚Äôs body weight, the prescribed treatment for HCQ ranges from 200 to 600mg, per day, over a 5 day timeframe; extend to 30 days if needed.</p>
<p>So if we were to take the average (400mg) that would take 2500 doses.</p>
<p>In other words, taking this drug every day for over 6 years and 324 days may cause some heart issues. Or roughly about 6 years and 319 days over the recommend treatment period.</p>
<p>3.) There wasn‚Äôt enough data to support recommending it.</p>
<p>Ok, forget about the fact that there is 70 years worth of data that HCQ was an effective drug to take against respiratory attacking viruses from malaria to even fucking SARS-Cov; on May 14, 2020, there were about 1 million cases and 90,000 deaths in the United States, The NIH announced it was launching an outpatient trial of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
<p>A month later, the agency closed the trial because of the lack of enrollment with only 20 of 2000 patients recruited.</p>
<p>Wait, what? After 1 month, they could only find 20 patients to test this on?</p>
<p>Yep. They closed it acknowledging there were no safety concerns associated with the trial, but the lack of subjects became their model to work off of for their outpatient trials.</p>
<p>The most deadly virus in the world, in 2020 and they quit looking?</p>
<p>So what happened when they stopped looking? The FDA revoked the emergency use for CQ and HCQ due to its ineffectiveness in hospitalized patients. The most effective drug for SARS-Cov, according to that 2005 supported by the NIH, and the FDA revoked its emergency use?</p>
<p>Again; this is the type of drug you take to help fight the early stages of Covid, not the advanced stages.  If doctors were allowed to prescribe this harmless and safe drug cocktail to all their patients complaining about a cough or fever; this virus may have been beat by last June.</p>
<p>What the fuck?!?</p>
<p>Ok, all of that information aside; doctors aren‚Äôt stupid, they know not to get swept up into the politics of medicine. Why didn‚Äôt they just prescribe off label like they have been for decades when they want to treat their patients?</p>
<p>Because of dickhead governors, like Whitmer in Michigan leading the way in suppressing science and medicine; Doctors and pharmacists were being threatened with losing their license if they prescribed off label.</p>
<p>That link, was from March 26, 2020, just 13 days after the whole world shut down from Covid‚Ä¶ long before the NIH even did their ‚Äústudy‚Äù‚Ä¶ all because President Trump made that promising remark on its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Just to show I‚Äôm not taking anything out of context; this is that entire March 19, 2020 task force briefing. where he made his statement regarding HCQ.</p>
<p>And then following that meeting, when a reporter asked Fauci for a response on it during a press briefing the very next day Fauci completely went against president Trump in this exchange;</p>
<p>Q    And to Dr. Fauci, if I could.  Dr. Fauci ‚Äî this was explained yesterday ‚Äî there has been some promise with hydroxychloroquine as potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus.  Is there any evidence to suggest that, as with malaria, it might be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19?</p>
<p>DR. FAUCI:  No.  The answer is no.  And the evidence that you‚Äôre talking about, John, is anecdotal evidence.  So as the Commissioner of FDA and the President mentioned yesterday, we‚Äôre trying to strike a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people available, at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it‚Äôs truly safe and truly effective.</p>
<p>But the information that you‚Äôre referring to specifically is anecdotal; it was not done in a controlled clinical trial.  So you really can‚Äôt make any definitive statement about it.</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT:  I think, without saying too much, I‚Äôm probably more of a fan of that than ‚Äî maybe than anybody.  But I‚Äôm a big fan, and we‚Äôll see what happens.  And we all understand what the doctor said is 100 percent correct.  It‚Äôs early.  But we‚Äôve ‚Äî you know, I‚Äôve seen things that are impressive.  And we‚Äôll see.  We‚Äôre going to know soon.  We‚Äôre going to know soon ‚Äî including safety. But, you know, when you get to safety, this has been prescribed for many years for people to combat malaria, which was a big problem.  And it‚Äôs very effective.  It‚Äôs a strong ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strong drug.  So we‚Äôll see.</p>
<p>Q    It was also fairly effective against SARS.</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT:  It was a very ‚Äî it was, as I understand that.  Is that a correct statement ‚Äî it was fairly effective on SARS?</p>
<p>DR. FAUCI:  John, you‚Äôve got to be careful when you say ‚Äúfairly effective.‚Äù  It was never done in a clinical trial.  They compared it to anything.  It was given to individuals and felt that maybe it worked.  So ‚Äî</p>
<p>Q    But was there anything to compare it to?</p>
<p>DR. FAUCI:  Well, that‚Äôs the point.  Whenever you do a clinical trial, you do standard of care versus ‚Äústandard of care plus the agent you‚Äôre evaluating.  That‚Äôs the reason why we showed, back in Ebola, why particular interventions worked.</p>
<p>Once the election was over, some medical colleges/journals started stepping back in their stances on it, like The American Journal on Medicine here that wrote up a second look on it in January of 2021</p>
<p>Now, HCQ is safe again.</p>
<p>If you get a chance, take a look at the The Economic Standard</p>
<p>And the white paper  from AmericasFrontLineDoctors.</p>
<p>Both have better deep dives that I could ever explain, I‚Äôm mostly paraphrasing.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I know I rambled there, but this kind of stuff needs to be seen and addressed.  Over 500k people died from SARS-Cov in the US and the number didn‚Äôt need to be that high.  This so called ‚Äúparty of science‚Äù blocked actual science which directly resulted in many unnecessary deaths.</p>

        <p>Yep. It's fucked up how from the beginnig of the pandemic very quickly curing covid was given up and vaccines became the only strategy. Like that trial you mentioned for example, and just so many more things... The example I made regarding vitamin D too, the only thing I have heard from the official side is to not take it because "dangerous".</p>
<p>There is a big conflict of interest (economical and even political) in the research to promote newly patented technology over using a generic medicine, so we should take any of the studies of new treatments with some salt. One would imagine what they would have told us if the vaccines actually failed their trials...</p>
<p>I just don't have a clear opinion on whether HCQ helps or not, also compared with other available drugs and even vitamins, I guess that got me downvoted to oblivion here.</p>

        <p>Um... veterans died as a result of taking hydroxychloroquine for COVID after it was shown to cause arythmia. It doesn‚Äôt work against COVID, and there is no medical evidence that shows that it has any preventive or therapeutic effects. Twitler said it did and the sheep started lining up to buy a product that he was invested in. Covidiots believed a pathological liar. They also believe he won the election despite strong evidence to the contrary. Most commenters on this sub are just stupid and easily influenced by groupthink. Q conspiracy nut jobs rule this sub. It‚Äôs embarrassing and sad.</p>

        <p>Yes this is a credible study because it‚Äôs given very early on the infection. This combination was never touted as a cure, but a way to prevent the virus from replicating, thus never letting patients get sicker and to the point where the develop respiratory failure. Benign drugs, cheap, effective‚Ä¶.but the MSM and people like Chris Matthews would shout that it would kill us. Lupus patients have been taking it for decades here in the US.</p>

        <p>So was the VA study that you quoted where patients weren‚Äôt killed by it, dummy. It was not a randomized trial because those patient types should never have gotten it. People have been taking HCQ for decades for lupus here in the US. It doesn‚Äôt kill people. The people in that trial were past the point where it could help them, yet someone still reported the misinformation that you are hanging on to.</p>

        <p>No they didn‚Äôt. That was a retrospective analysis where HCQ was given to intubated patients in VA hospitals, which was already proven that its most effective when given early on from in the infection. That trial showed what infectious disease doctors already know, but then the mainstream media said it ‚Äúkilled them‚Äù. Not the case at all. They were never going to survive at that point.

        <p>I post this almost daily now; but only because it‚Äôs information that needs to be seen.</p>
<p>Sometimes a few people see it, sometimes it gets downvoted to the shadow realm for some reason.</p>
<p>But everything I‚Äôm saying here is fact and all my sources (except one) is from non-partisan sources. The link from a partisan source is just an example of that situation of which it‚Äôs talked about.</p>
<p>The TL;DR on everything (i get a little wordy here) is basically just going to say; ‚ÄúThe self-proclaimed ‚Äúparty of science‚Äù is nothing but a bunch of dickheads that really fucked up this world.‚Äù</p>
<p>To begin, what made doctors look to Hydroxychloroquine as an off label treatment? What is it?</p>
<p>First; HCQ has been one of the most prescribed drugs in the word for treatment against viruses and bacteria that attack the respiratory system for over 70 years.  It‚Äôs also one of the few drugs that have absolutely zero restrictions (meaning it‚Äôs safe for use by pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, children, elderly and even those with immune deficiencies). It was a natural choice to lead off with something that is incredibly safe, effective, decade‚Äôs of proven data and low cost!</p>
<p>Second; the NIH (under the direction of Fauci) supported and put out a study on the effectiveness of CQ against SARS-COV way back in 05. So turning to HCQ (it‚Äôs derivative) was a definite no brainier.</p>
<p>The first time HCQ was ever questioned for its effectiveness or safety (that I can find); was in 2020 when President Trump, duringa task force briefing said; ‚Äú[Chloroquine and its derivative, Hydroxychloroquine] showed unique promise as potentially effective treatments for Coronavirus‚Äù</p>
<p>That's all he said.  Nothing more... just a promising, but factual statement during a time when all of America was shitting their pants on this new global killer.  But after that statement, is when everyone started looking for reasons to hate on it, and that snowball started with Fauci,  one day after DJT said that during the meeting.</p>
<p>So what did they shit on HCQ for?  There were three primary reasons;</p>
<p>1.) ineffectiveness - meaning this didn‚Äôt work in every patient. Especially patients who were in the later stages of the effects of Covid and hospitalized. But patients who were treated in the earliest stages of Covid, had an incredibly high recovery rate (think it was in the mid-high 90%)</p>
<p>2.) dosage - As in, patients who received 1/2 to 1kilo of this drug, over the course of their lifetime, were prone to heart related issues.</p>
<p>Ok, that makes sense right? Too much of any drug can kill you.. Until you look at that number again‚Ä¶ 1/2 to 1kilo.</p>
<p>1 kilo = 1,000,000 milligrams.</p>
<p>Depending on the patient‚Äôs body weight, the prescribed treatment for HCQ ranges from 200 to 600mg, per day, over a 5 day timeframe; extend to 30 days if needed.</p>
<p>So if we were to take the average (400mg) that would take 2500 doses.</p>
<p>In other words, taking this drug every day for over 6 years and 324 days may cause some heart issues. Or roughly about 6 years and 319 days over the recommend treatment period.</p>
<p>3.) There wasn‚Äôt enough data to support recommending it.</p>
<p>Ok, forget about the fact that there is 70 years worth of data that HCQ was an effective drug to take against respiratory attacking viruses from malaria to even fucking SARS-Cov; on May 14, 2020, there were about 1 million cases and 90,000 deaths in the United States, The NIH announced it was launching an outpatient trial of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19.</p>
<p>A month later, the agency closed the trial because of the lack of enrollment with only 20 of 2000 patients recruited.</p>
<p>Wait, what? After 1 month, they could only find 20 patients to test this on?</p>
<p>Yep. They closed it acknowledging there were no safety concerns associated with the trial, but the lack of subjects became their model to work off of for their outpatient trials.</p>
<p>The most deadly virus in the world, in 2020 and they quit looking?</p>
<p>So what happened when they stopped looking? The FDA revoked the emergency use for CQ and HCQ due to its ineffectiveness in hospitalized patients. The most effective drug for SARS-Cov, according to that 2005 supported by the NIH, and the FDA revoked its emergency use?</p>
<p>Again; this is the type of drug you take to help fight the early stages of Covid, not the advanced stages.  If doctors were allowed to prescribe this harmless and safe drug cocktail to all their patients complaining about a cough or fever; this virus may have been beat by last June.</p>
<p>What the fuck?!?</p>
<p>Ok, all of that information aside; doctors aren‚Äôt stupid, they know not to get swept up into the politics of medicine. Why didn‚Äôt they just prescribe off label like they have been for decades when they want to treat their patients?</p>
<p>Because of dickhead governors, like Whitmer in Michigan leading the way in suppressing science and medicine; Doctors and pharmacists were being threatened with losing their license if they prescribed off label.</p>
<p>That link, was from March 26, 2020, just 13 days after the whole world shut down from Covid‚Ä¶ long before the NIH even did their ‚Äústudy‚Äù‚Ä¶ all because President Trump made that promising remark on its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Just to show I‚Äôm not taking anything out of context; this is that entire March 19, 2020 task force briefing. where he made his statement regarding HCQ.</p>
<p>And then following that meeting, when a reporter asked Fauci for a response on it during a press briefing the very next day Fauci completely went against president Trump in this exchange;</p>
<p>Q    And to Dr. Fauci, if I could.  Dr. Fauci ‚Äî this was explained yesterday ‚Äî there has been some promise with hydroxychloroquine as potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus.  Is there any evidence to suggest that, as with malaria, it might be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19?</p>
<p>DR. FAUCI:  No.  The answer is no.  And the evidence that you‚Äôre talking about, John, is anecdotal evidence.  So as the Commissioner of FDA and the President mentioned yesterday, we‚Äôre trying to strike a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people available, at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it‚Äôs truly safe and truly effective.</p>
<p>But the information that you‚Äôre referring to specifically is anecdotal; it was not done in a controlled clinical trial.  So you really can‚Äôt make any definitive statement about it.</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT:  I think, without saying too much, I‚Äôm probably more of a fan of that than ‚Äî maybe than anybody.  But I‚Äôm a big fan, and we‚Äôll see what happens.  And we all understand what the doctor said is 100 percent correct.  It‚Äôs early.  But we‚Äôve ‚Äî you know, I‚Äôve seen things that are impressive.  And we‚Äôll see.  We‚Äôre going to know soon.  We‚Äôre going to know soon ‚Äî including safety. But, you know, when you get to safety, this has been prescribed for many years for people to combat malaria, which was a big problem.  And it‚Äôs very effective.  It‚Äôs a strong ‚Äî it‚Äôs a strong drug.  So we‚Äôll see.</p>
<p>Q    It was also fairly effective against SARS.</p>
<p>THE PRESIDENT:  It was a very ‚Äî it was, as I understand that.  Is that a correct statement ‚Äî it was fairly effective on SARS?</p>
<p>DR. FAUCI:  John, you‚Äôve got to be careful when you say ‚Äúfairly effective.‚Äù  It was never done in a clinical trial.  They compared it to anything.  It was given to individuals and felt that maybe it worked.  So ‚Äî</p>
<p>Q    But was there anything to compare it to?</p>
<p>DR. FAUCI:  Well, that‚Äôs the point.  Whenever you do a clinical trial, you do standard of care versus ‚Äústandard of care plus the agent you‚Äôre evaluating.  That‚Äôs the reason why we showed, back in Ebola, why particular interventions worked.</p>
<p>Once the election was over, some medical colleges/journals started stepping back in their stances on it, like The American Journal on Medicine here that wrote up a second look on it in January of 2021</p>
<p>Now, HCQ is safe again.</p>
<p>If you get a chance, take a look at the The Economic Standard</p>
<p>And the white paper  from AmericasFrontLineDoctors.</p>
<p>Both have better deep dives that I could ever explain, I‚Äôm mostly paraphrasing.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>I know I rambled there, but this kind of stuff needs to be seen and addressed.  Over 500k people died from SARS-Cov in the US and the number didn‚Äôt need to be that high.  This so called ‚Äúparty of science‚Äù blocked actual science which directly resulted in many unnecessary deaths.</p>
