    <strong>Love thy neighbor?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm sincerely not even gonna hide my account, no throwaway, you can check that I'm immunocompromised and a parent myself. </p>
<p>My neighbor just asked me to watch her kids because 3 of the 4 adults in the house aren't feeling well after their second dose covid vaccines. </p>
<p>She asked me to watch her children...who have been coughing... Because they're unwell due to vaccine side effects. She also hinted at helping her with groceries. </p>
<p>I'm a recently religious person and I wish I could help, but fuck to the heck no. Stay your sick asses at home and don't you dare bring that variant shit near me and my family. God will protect you lol, I don't mean that in anger but seriously neighbor? Is there any moral logic to your request? </p>
<p>And I'm the selfish one for not vaccinating? Good luck and God bless.</p></p>

        <p>People are selfish and don't give a shit. If you said you had covid and wanted her to look after your kids, the answer would've been a definite no. These people I occasionally work for, were sick after their vaccines also, and their kids were also sick with some kind of flu (prob vax shedding) and someone in their school had tested positive for covid, yet they still allowed me to come in and didn't even tell me until I had already got there and was in the house. They are v selfish and uncaring about others even though they claim the opposite.</p>

        <p>Yeah their kids aren't feeling great either and that was my initial reason for declining to help her out. It could just be a cold that's causing her daughter's sniffles but to me - a cold is detrimental and I will end up on a round of steroids for multiple sclerosis flare up.</p>

        <p>Maybe send the kids a care package with the essentials to keep them healthy, but...if they all took the vaxxx...then you have the right to protect yourself against those spike proteins. Stay safe, stay pray-filled</p>

        <p>I like kids and watch my nieces and nephews but if my neighbors randomly wanted me to drop everything to watch their sick children‚Ä¶ hell no. Even if it‚Äôs just a cold, I don‚Äôt want to have to miss work. I don‚Äôt blame you.</p>

        <p>So these adults had the genius idea to ALL get their second doses at the exact same time, knowing that there‚Äôs kids to care for? Even the pro-vax people I know preemptively took 1-2 days off work because side effects are pretty expected.</p>
