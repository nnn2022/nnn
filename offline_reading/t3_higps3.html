        <p>Wake up and smell the coffee, it's an agenda... It ain't a joke or a prank it's dead serious, for some it might not be clicking yet but I guarantee by end of year it will.</p>
<p>At any time going forward, the stroke of a pen from a deep state politician anywhere in the world can force businesses to close, curfews, arrests, ect... In the name of your safety of course.</p>
<p>I think the general population will wake up by year end once it's close to a full year of mandatory masks, vaccines, line ups, social distancing and tracking. All this for a flu that has a IFR of 0.04 % under 70, two times weaker then Influenza. By next winter, hold on to your hats, lockdown 2.0 is gonna be severely draconian considering lockdown 1.0 didn't work the way they hoped.</p>
<p>99.95 % of people who catch covid survive, I always knew the vast majority of people were stupid, but this kind of stupid is really hard to fathom until you actually witness it for your own eyes. They actually faked a deadly virus, a " pandemic " and they got a significant amount of the global population gobbling every word about it...</p>

<p>If you read enough history, especially in the 20th century, you’ll see that if media and/or the government repeats a lie enough, totally bombarding their population with a specific message, most of the population will eventually come to believe the message no matter how incredible,  ridiculous and anti factual the message is.</p>

<p>It's funny. I've always known people were this stupid, but I've been chastized for it on Reddit, even before the COVID mess, over and over again. "Shut up, (my main username), you're a pathetic cynical piece of shit! People are actually really smart! And also very kind! Just because a few people are dumb and cruel doesn't mean the majority are!"</p>
<p>Eh. I've been through enough in my life to question the intelligence and "goodness" of the masses. I want to say it's nice other people are beginning to see it the same way, but...I always want to be wrong about these things. Always.</p>

        <p>I foretold this was going to happen. I caught a lot of hell for being a "doomer" at /r/lockdownskepticism, and people got pretty angry at me over predicting more lockdowns in the future. Now that it turns out that I'm right, I wish I could gloat about it. I can't, because I wanted to be wrong so desperately...</p>
<p>Yeah, like many others in this post have said, this was never about health from the get-go. I've always felt that if they were being cautious about the overall damage done due to the virus, the lockdown would be a <em>last resort</em>. The fact they jumped into it so quickly, citing fucking <strong>China</strong> as the reason to do so, threw up tons of red flags. </p>
<p>What does surprise me a bit is Republican states being the first ones to lockdown again, but...I did see some theorists claim that this would be done as a means to show people that "no state is safe", and that red states would demonstrate that re-opening was a failure, in order to make the next wave of lockdowns run longer, and more strict (like, Italy strict, wherein people can't even go out for walks). It's super scary how right those guys were, and I believe them now.</p>
<p>What is the agenda? Well, hard to say because there's so many angles they could be gunning for. Definitely more control of the population, "giving them what they want" because yes, the majority does want this (I know, people will fling stories about how normal their areas are but...eh...sorry, I'm having trouble buying it after what I see with my own eyes...). There are theories about this being a part of an overall plan to gain more control of people, to justify more surveillance and less privacy, to oust Trump from office, etc etc. Anything is possible at this point, I'd say.</p>

        <p>Meh. Even in these places, I am not seeing the enlightenment I'd hoped.</p>
<p>The top comment at one of the shutdown Arizona posts at /r/lockdownskepticism states the answer back in March should have been locking down indoor gatherings and "superspreader events like concerts", and that would have been the end of this by now. I can't believe people still think like that in subs like this. Lockdown, in any form, was never the answer for this virus. (And yes, even back in March, data like the IFR numbers <strong>was</strong> available!)</p>

        <p>Are you in Australia ? (Vic). We have more lockdowns... It's not the whole state but it's a decent portion and it's basically sending the message that we can go back into lockdown again whenever they think the cases are 'out of control'. </p>
<p>The only thing they've announced is the cases (64 new). Nothing about hospitalisations or the health system. Where did flatten the curve go?</p>
<p>Australia officially has a 'suppression' strategy but in practice very clearly has an elimination strategy.</p>

        <p>I'm so fucking tired of the word "lockdown" as applied in this instance.</p>
<p>I'm incredibly disturbed how it just wormed its way into the lexicon.</p>
<p>The word lockdown arose in the 1970s in America, specifically referring to locking down prisoners in prison. For 40 years the definition remained unchanged. In the mid 2010s, a second definition was quietly added in, basically referring to that it could be used to define what schools do for "active shooter drills".</p>
<p>So what's the implication? We're all prisoners? I mean, why not? Apparently schoolchildren already are. Prisoners indeed.</p>

Over what we suspected and now know for certain is a mild disease that isn't signifigantly worse than any of the others already floating around.

        <p>You don't even need to go into conspiratorial territory to explain what's going on. What we are seeing is a panic feedback loop exploited by and further proliferated by greedy and power-hungry corporate and political elite entities (i.e. the media, Big Retail, and many members of our government) for their own gain along with international players (like China), groups like Antifa, and people like the average everyday attention-whoring Twitter moron aiming for retweets influencing how things play out. </p>
<p>It's quite simple, really. No NWOs, Deep States, Secret Satanist Clubs, or Lunar Nazi Lizard People required.</p>

        <p>There is quite the continuum of conspiracy theorists, as this thread demonstrates. Six months ago I would have laughed at anyone suggesting that there could be a global conspiracy of this magnitude. However, seeing the vaccine agenda being relentlessly pushed while cheaper drugs like hydroxychloroquine are being traduced by fake studies (see Lancet retraction scandal); internet censorship of people trying to tell the truth about the virus; MSM media acting with one voice; the likely cover-up of an accidental release from a Wuhan Lab etc,  has made me question everything.</p>
<p>It <em>is</em> possible that they are all working in concert without having gathered in a darkened room first too, I guess. As you suggest, they may just have found common cause to exploit the situation.</p>

        <p>The conspiracy theorists typically post here when most users of the sub are not online, every subreddit has it's weird hour of the day/night and ours is no different.</p>
<p>I personally just find it much easier and simpler to explain that they just found common cause to exploit the situation and peddle it even more along. There may be some collusion on smaller scales between local or regional entities (especially in the corporate world or in partisan politics) but I find the idea that there is some global grand scale conspiracy conducted by some super secret Satan club that every powerful person in the world is a part of (with the exception of those in the political party the conspiracy theorist typically votes for, conveniently) to be not very likely.</p>

<p>It's not a "super secret Satan club", you're basically just being purposefull hyperbolic. Do you really think it's impossible to believe that governments, even multiple ones around the global, wouldn't collaborate together to push an agenda? Whether that agenda is to gain more control of citizens or to change the way the world is run or whatever? As /u/bowled_a_googly observes, there's just too much interference by too many interested parties to just dismiss that there's a grander conspiracy going on right now. And no, it's not just "governors trying to cover their asses", because if it was, I think you and I both know they'd just quickly re-open then drop the matter. Right now, it seems the media and the governments are in bed together, stoking fears to keep the majority afraid. And it's working.</p>

        <p>That is all fine and good <em>except</em> I do see the posts in here about everything is conducted "super secret Satan clubs" by a few morons who might drop by from time to time. I even said in said in my response that I do not deny some collusion on local and regional levels (which can include between some governments, even if I find a grand scale centralized global conspiracy by some central org unlikely), so your long-winded response is pointless. </p>

        <p>I'm not trying to "accomplish" anything, so maybe drop the snippy reply. What I am saying is that there is something amiss with the way the lockdowns have been implemented, and it's not just "governors being stupid". Due to the way the media and government are trying to silence voices, re-implement more lockdowns, etc; there is much more to this than people here (most LDS) want to admit. At this point, attributing everything going on to incompetence or to just a small scale goof-up is naive.</p>

        <p>You've been one of the proponents, based on my past interactions with you, to claim that what's been going on is just mere small scale interference and whatnot. At this point, especially with more lockdowns happening in spite of all the data collected, along with mass censorship, the massive push for the vaccine (especially when vaccines haven't been created in "lightspeed" before now) and other goings-ons globally, I feel it's rather naive to act like nothing is happening on a global scale, and that this is all just a mishap.

I know how fucked up everything all is, but I think there are less convoluted ways to piece it together that make more sense to me (and not once did I chalk it up to "mere stupidity and screwups"), that's all I am saying.</p>

<p>No. Re-read my previous comment.</p>
<p>&rt; You've been one of the proponents, based on my past interactions with you, to claim that what's been going on is just mere small scale interference and whatnot.</p>
<p>You've argued that there is no grand conspiracy going on, that this is just a small scale incident based solely on panic, and governments just reacting to the same panic. If this was the case, I don't see why they would continue to ignore the data for the virus, along with continuing with more restrictions/lockdowns. In fact, you'd think the governments would be using the appropriate science they claim to follow, in order to placate people and keep calm, but no, they are feeding into the same panic and fear because...they don't want it to end, for whatever reason. I think it's naive to claim that this is all solely happening due to fear and incompetence based on what is currently going on.</p>

        <p>They're not "secretly running the world". They are governing bodies that are colluding to accomplish something, likely to consolidate more control, power, and wealth. If you really believe that to be "bonkers", then you are clearly ignorant about how corrupt ruling parties can be. Open a history book, and read up on past rulers who've committed atrocities in a quest to control their citizens. The difference now compared to the past is that technology is making it easier to do this, and we are seeing this unfold in different ways than the past.</p>

        <p>&rt; I find the idea that there is some global grand scale conspiracy conducted by some super secret Satan club that every powerful person in the world is a part of (with the exception of those in the political party the conspiracy theorist typically votes for, conveniently) to be not very likely.</p>
<p>Such ideas generally hinge around the assumption that government is competent. Which they aren't. For instance, the Clinton Body Bags conspiracy theory (that Bill Clinton quietly ordered the deaths of dozens of people who had dirt on him) falls apart when one realizes that, for the theory to be true, that it would mean the President was able to secretly order the murders of dozens of American citizens without being found out, ratted on, prosecuted, impeached, or even so much as accused of such crimes by members of Congress, including staunch political opponents; and was also able to flawlessly carry out such atrocities while demonstrating complete and utter fallibility (if not gross ineptitude) in the face of other, more mundane challenges (e.g., Clinton's inability to squelch accusations of sexual improprieties and avoid impeachment).</p>

        <p>The end-game is the same as it always has been. The deep state wants complete control of us (which they clearly already achieved) and they want us to give up our god-given rights to serve the beast they serve. People who rule over us worship Satan and are not good people. I wish people would wake up to it. These very same people are falsely accusing President trump of being responsible for the virus when it’s clear as day it came from China and the Democrats/gop knew. Remember all the senators who got busted for insider trading right as this went down? Yeah, they want you to forget.</p>

        <p>GOP has not only been entirely useless, but also complicit in the lockdowns and New Normal. All this whole thing has proven to me is that both parties suck equally. If the GOP was as pro-freedom as they claim to be they'd be pushing lawsuits in all states to end mandates and legally block any further ones where they have majority, so far the only state that has happened in is Wisconsin, but that is moreso due to the cultural nature of Wisconsin than anything. Also not to mention all the GOP governors who put in mandates and orders.</p>
<p>Let's face it, the GOP is mostly in on it.</p>

<p>Yet i hear completely opposite stories.</p>
<p>I have a few friends who work in the medical field and have done for years. Some of them say the is NO second wave coming, just as a matter of fact. Some say the complete opposite and try to make us all terrified. </p>
<p>If even the medical professionals have no fucking clue then what is going on. </p>
<p>If we have to lock down again we are fucked. my country already has a hole in the national budget of 68 Miljard ( i think that's a billion?) Euros. We can NOT afford to close the economy again. We have to move forward.</p>

        <p>I think the medical professionals who claim their hospitals are overflowing, and/or that the second wave is deadly, are just outright lying. Why are they lying? Either they are just trying to gain attention, trying to promote more lockdowns/restrictions out of fear (though you'd think medics would never better, given all the current data), or they are somehow "in on" whatever it is that's going on.</p>

        <p>They only see the worst of the worst cases. They're super biased cause if someone gets to them, it's cause they're dying.     <br>
Also nurses are always overworked and underpaid and I guess they aren't looking forward to being more overworked.      </p>

        <p>Thing is, stretching as far back as March, I've seen many nurses and doctors come forward online (on Reddit, Twitter, wherever), claiming their hospitals are over capacity, that they've held children dying of COVID in their arms, that people are dropping dead all over the hospital as a result of the virus, etc. I gave them the benefit of the doubt back then, but at this point, I think they are just plain lying for whatever reason.</p>
