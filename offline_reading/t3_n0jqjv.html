    <p><p>Not that it would be ignorant if you had, but I think the authoritative handling of covid has been quite unsurprising, and long awaited, because this sort of stuff was going on ages back, in a less obvious and less mainstream way.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies have rushed vaccine programs for decades.</p>
<p>Diseases have been overstated and exaggerated to create fear, for decades, well centuries.</p>
<p>Doctors and scientists have been silenced, censored, and mistreated in relation to medicine and disease for yonks.</p>
<p>People's concerns and experiences with side effects have gone ignored and diluted by authority for ages.</p>
<p>I think you get the picture.</p>
<p>It's time we exposed all of it.</p>
<p>This is a time, where either we win, or they win. Now. This decade.</p>
<p>You get to decide, because, you have the truth. You just have to share it. So, lets share it. Let's not miss an opportunity.</p></p>

        <p>I think there's a lot of honest good doctors, and I think there's a lot of dishonest doctors, and I think there's some who are good, but are just too scared to not do as they're told.</p>
<p>There's a big problem, when a physician cannot speak up about a real vaccine injury. </p>
<p>That's been happening for decades.</p>

<li>All vaxxes are good and safe.</li>
<li>Vaccines stopped communicable diseases and there was no decline prior to their development.</li>

        <p>It's a good thing science knows more than they did decades or centuries ago.</p>
<p>Doctors still did blood-letting like a century ago? Does that mean we shouldn't trust them because they made mistakes (and learned from them) in the past?</p>
<p>Slavery used to be legal. Are we still racists?
Women used to be unable to vote. Are we still misogynists?
Everyone used to be Christians in Europe. Are we religious?</p>
<p>Just because vaccines weren't the best decades ago doesn't mean they are still just as bad today. Literally everything improves with time; name me one technology or cultural phenomenon that doesn't.</p>
