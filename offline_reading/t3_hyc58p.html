    <strong>Please. Somebody give me hope, please.</strong>
    <p><p>Article after article I read that "health experts say shut down the country". I can barely take this anymore )': them and they're followers pretend to care and tell us we dont while simultaneously not caring about suicides, mental health, addiction, small businesses, hopelessness and misery. They can't do this. Please they just cant. And it seems like the media is grooming us so they can do just that. I've been praying every single day and it seems like things will start to go in the right direction and shit itself again. Please, I'm begging. Somebody give me some kind of hope</p></p>

        <p>The media can try to groom people for it but way more people simply aren’t scared anymore about it. They’ve fucked themselves in many ways: first lockdown, they said masks don’t work and that locking ourselves away was the only option. Now masks are accepted in lieu of hiding away and people aren’t going to buy it that now masks don’t work again and lockdown is the only way.</p>
<p>The 3 states most prominently in the news lately: Arizona, Texas and Florida have gotten through their worst peaks without closing most businesses. Anyone with half a brain can see that and it’s not a majority thinking these states are crashing and burning. I haven’t heard of any of these states hitting surge capacity even on their worst days. The original lockdown was pitched to try and save hospital space. It has now been proven that nearly every state doesn’t need total shutdown to accomplish that. Hell they don’t even hardly need anything shutdown considering we now have better treatment and know more about keeping people alive through this than we did in March.</p>
<p>Mnuchin is pretty high up there in terms of calling the shots and the fact that he’s saying we are no longer going to pay people to not work with tax payer money and they’re lowering unemployment pay out is pretty telling that they don’t plan to nationalize a lockdown. It doesn’t even incentivize states on their own to call a lockdown. The money will dictate this considerably.</p>
<p>California has had arguably some of the most strict and draconian rules throughout this and their numbers have constantly been high. They’ve never seen a downturn. They’ve mandated masks even outside and haven’t seen a downturn. They’ve done every goddamn authoritarian move in the book and their cases have just consistently been a mess and been high. The rest of the country can see that. </p>
<p>When you see polls that say “Americans support another lockdown by 75%”, they have tucked away in the article that they only polled 1000-2000 people. I could probably find 1000 people with absolutely zero awareness or forward-thinking and a penchant for that sweet $600/week to tell a pollster they support another lockdown. Going out and about complete refutes that. Going to restaurants and stores and malls absolutely doesn’t align with these polls. The American media fucking hates Americans. They hate this country. They want it to go down in flames (of course not realizing they would go down with it but rarely does anyone wishing for the demise of something understand they would be part of that demise). </p>
<p>Hundreds of bars in texas are about to defy orders to stay closed by opening. They wouldn’t do that if they didn’t know enough people in their orbits who will visit and patronize these bars once they reopen. That means enough people are 100% over this shit that hundreds of bars believe they can illegally reopen and make plenty of money to support their reopening. </p>
<p>The news and the media are the last vestige of hysteria in all of this. They are making more money than they ever have by keeping people at home and clicking on articles to open. Why would they want to give it up? They don’t. The people are going forward without their blessing and rightly so. Don’t give media their clicks. Don’t indulge their fear porn. Talk to people separately of whatever you’re seeing on major MSM articles and never forget that in addition to the MSM, there are several countries paying their citizens to AstroTurf American spaces with soul-crushing opinions to try and break people’s spirits. Take every insane opinion you see in comments with a large grain of salt. There’s a good chance over half of them are written to seed doubt and foment fear in whoever they can sink their teeth into.</p>

        <p>As an Arizonan, I can confirm that AZ indeed wasn't hit hard, unlike what many continue to insist. There are many in my state that want a second shutdown, but they're in the minority fortunately. I hope Governor Ducey doesn't continue to bend over backwards to satisfy the left. It doesn't matter though. He's already ripped away my trust in his leadership.</p>

<p>Don’t give up hope. People are doing things. I fly a lot still and flights are more  crowded and more expensive than before. People are slowing giving fewer shits besucase most people don’t know anyone that died. They are putting two and two together but outwardly most people won’t say it.</p>

        <p>Read up on what life was like after the 1918 flu.   And before you say "this isn't like that flu", I know it isn't.  I'm talking about the lockdowns - very similar.

        <p>Are you suggesting because we don't produce our own consumer goods, the economy can't recover?  Or are you suggesting because we don't produce our own consumer goods, we don't need to wear masks?  Or are you suggesting we should produce all of our own consumer goods, and assume the average materialistic consumer would be willing to spend 3x on a similar product?  </p>
<p>It is unclear to me what your argument is, however it is clear to me you are ignoring the fact that the world (not just the US) recovered from the lockdown effects of the 1918 flu - yet maintaining the position that the US (and probably the world) will never recover from the current lockdown... </p>

<p>Because since we stopped producing our own consumer goods because companies shutdown factories and moved jobs to China, we have embraced the service industry. And the service industry has been affected by the lockdowns. Even the tech industry has been affected.</p>
<p>Not everyone for permanment lost their job can retrain or learn a trade or code.</p>

        <p>Frankly I think this line of thinking is naive. Yeah, cases are plummeting, but try telling Cuomo that. He's become a dictator. He tells New Yorkers that if we're good boys and girls, he'll give us bars, restaurants, gyms and movie theaters, and he chides us when we don't follow his arbitrary, illogical rules. And the people eat it up. It can't keep up forever? I see no signs of it stopping.</p>

        <p>I don't know if this is an answer you are looking for. I feel exactly like you do today. </p>
<p>One of my friends who fought with people about this on FB for a few months has come to the conclusion that her peace of mind is more important. The rest of the world is absolutely deluded. Even people I thought were smart, independent thinkers have swallowed this whole. </p>
<p>My world has become very small. I don't leave my house of talk to many people. Luckily I live with my husband and kids but none of them agree with me. </p>
<p>I don't know what the future holds. Lots of people here offer scary ideas of a dystopian future. No matter what happens, you will need your inner resources most of all. </p>
<p>Happiness is an inside job. Allowing ourselves to stay in negative states is self abuse. We want things to return to normal. Right now that is not something most of us can have. Focusing on something you can't have is suffering. I'm a very impatient person and I don't want to work on cultivating patience. However, I can find something meaningful to think about or I can stay in negativity, which affects my health and my relationships. </p>
<p>I think this can be done in a way that isn't giving in to the doomers. They are the ones in fear all the time. They are the ones resisting the fact that death is part of life and every now and then a strong virus comes along. They are the ones arguing with reality. Unfortunately it's a majority thought pattern at the moment. We don't think like that. Sometimes finding one's own inner peace is an act of revolution.</p>

        <p>I have gone back and forth between despair and optimism this whole time. But lately I have reached a place of acceptance and peace. Not that I will EVER accept or forgive what they have done to us as a society and what they (politicians, media, doomers) continue to do. But given all the research I have done, I feel confident that I know how it will play out, regardless of what happens. Every area in the world has been following the same curve... the virus ramps up, there are "spikes and surges" in cases, and then it peters out. Herd immunity hits at somewhere between 15-20% of the population infected. </p>
<p>Being in the SF Bay Area, we locked down so hard and so early that we have only delayed the inevitable. SoCal is closer to the HIT than we are, so I know that this nonsense will go on for more months here but it is easier to accept since I don't expect anything different. My kid won't be in school or play sports this year, we can't travel (much) or go out to dinner inside or go to concerts or movies or parties, and won't be able to through 2020 at least. So what can I do? Make the most of the life I have and wait it out. I do have friends who will socialize, my kid has friends whose parents aren't crazy, my daughter is returning to college out of state (whatever that looks like, at least she gets to go.) I have discovered something new I enjoy which is kayaking, I'm excited to go again this week.</p>
<p>And I won't follow their stupid rules. Other than wear a mask in stores because I don't want to hurt the businesses. But I'll pull it down if I want to, and I'll never wear one outside.</p>
<p>I'm writing everything down in a journal so I can look back years from now and know I was on the right side of history.</p>

        <p>I wore a mask twice, once for work but it was optional, once cause I had to. 2nd time my brother and I were replacing the spark plugs in my step dad s truck. My brother broke a cable and I had to go to Auto Zone to replace it. I knew they wouldn't let me in without one so I swallowed my pride for that. It was a birthday present as well so. I haven't worn one since, probably won't either. Fuck em'.</p>

        <p>Do you know who JP Sears is?</p>
<p>He has a GREAT YouTube channel called Awaken with JP-- very very funny videos about the lockdown and masks, etc. He's right on the money. He also has a podcast and website, Instagram and Facebook, yadda yadda. I would check out his YouTube videos asap. They will make you laugh and they might give you a mental reprieve.</p>
<p>He's big into civil liberties. He saves my sanity. You're not alone.</p>

        <p>Don't give up, friend. People all around the world are in fact fighting this on every front, at every level. The mainstream media is obviously not going to publish or highlight anything that contradicts the prevailing narrative, so it's no surprise that they'll either ignore those efforts entirely to make them seem insignificant or only report on them in such a fashion that ridicules dissent. </p>
<p>It's not an exhaustive list by any stretch but I'll just list a few things here that come to mind that will hopefully help you regain a sense of optimism about this.</p>

</ul>
<p>You might enjoy watching some content from independent creators that started covering covid related events, like:</p>

</ul>
<p>There are obviously way more but hopefully this gives you a good start and at least shows that it's not a lost cause, but quite the opposite in fact, as they double down on stupid with censorship and manipulation of the mainstream platforms, we get "exponential growth" of independent/citizen journalists and more neutral alternative platforms (LBRY, Bitchute, Dtube &amp; Dlive just to name but a few).</p>
<p>In doing my small part, I re-upload videos <a href="https://lbry.tv/@LockdownSkepticism:f">here</a> and <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/channel/LockdownSkepticism/">here</a>. Stay strong, and stay free!</p>

        <p>Please don’t give up hope. If anything, we need critical thinking, brave people to help us fight the cause of resistance. Remember they WANT you to give up and lose hope.

        <p>Today I went out with my mom to some tourist attractions and there were plenty of people out and about.  Indoors people wore masks (the people at the gate impressed the importance of it so they didn't get shut down) but didn't stay distant really.  I went to an outdoor attraction and there were SO many more people there than I expected.  Some masked, some not, but just the sheer amount of people out felt like a normal summer evening.  </p>
<p>There are also plenty of people who were "doomers" and are slowly changing opinion- myself included!  Last month when my family came out for my birthday, I made them stay distant and wouldn't give hugs because the concept of it drove my media induced anxiety through the roof.  When my brother came out to do some work for me, we got within six feet and I got so upset at myself afterwards because I had convinced myself I had potentially put him in danger.  But some more reading and some soul searching later, and I had a pretty normal day out with my mom and I don't have any internal angst about it.  </p>
<p>I hope that offers at least some small bits of hope?</p>

        <p>There's tremendous effort on vaccines and the US is planning 300 million by January and approval of multiple vaccines by maybe October.  I know people here are often skeptical of the vaccines, but I feel that's the only way this ends. There's also monoclonal antibodies very soon.</p>
