    <strong>Kicked Out of Restaurant Depot Today</strong>
    <p><p>So I had to pick up 3 items for production for the company I work for. I have shopped inside before after the mask mandates were implemented in Austin and no one said a thing to me. Well today it happened. A guy in dairy confronted me. The lady upfront also told me to wear a mask but I just said ok and walked past her. Anyway, I was in the cooler section of the store looking for ginger, couldn't find it, walked to the other side and that's when it happened.</p>
<p>"Sir, you need a mask." </p>
<p>Me: "I don't have one."</p>
<p>"Well you have to have one to shop here."</p>
<p>Me: "I've shopped here before without one."</p>
<p>"No you haven't, not here."</p>
<p>Me: "Uh, yes I have."</p>
<p>"Not today."</p>
<p>Walking to the front we approach the lady I saw initially and she said, " I tried to tell him."</p>
<p>Me: "You do realize mandates are not law, laws are legislated."</p>
<p>"That's not my problem sir, you need a mask, the store right down the street sells them."</p>
<p>Other employees: "This is a private business so we have the right to...."</p>
<p>All three were surrounding me and though I had a mask in my pocket, I just couldn't put it on. Every single cell and atom in my body was telling me "NO" do not put it on. I couldn't. I walked out knowing this could affect my employment and I didn't care. I've walked out of jobs before and I had less money saved than I do now. I imagined myself doing a trust fall with God being the one to catch me. I don't know how, but I know my family and I WILL be taken care of. Fuck the New Normal. I know it's hard to live it, but you have to have your principles intact. I've always gone against the grain so it's a little (emphasis on little) easier for me than most but not by much, lol. With all three of them surrounding me it was most definitely intense, got a little adrenalin rush but I stood my ground. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, the guy who confronted me was wearing a balaclava and it didn't even make a good face covering or cover his mouth and nose.</p>
<p>Me: "You know you guys aren't even wearing your mask properly?" </p>
<p>"Again sir, not my problem..."</p>
<p>I left saying, "Well there's a whole lot of lawsuits coming down the pipe and it will be y'alls problem..." </p>
<p>I felt like if I complied at that moment my spirit would have been damaged and I just can't allow that. Decided to share my experience on how walking the walk must be done to end this shit. Not gonna lie it's hard as fuck, but anything worth doing usually is. Stay strong. Stay brave. I'm with you, especially in spirit. </p>
<p>Update: Went to 3 other places with mask requirements mask free and was not turned away or hassled. 3 out of 4, not too shabby! 😎</p></p>

        <p>I've notified corporate offices multiple times about my bad experiences. I've also let them know that some people are unable to wear masks due to PTSD, autism, or speech/hearing impediments. Which is true. </p>
<p>Just don't lie about having a condition: we aren't like them.</p>
<p>Edit: I will say in some cases anxiety is recognized as a medical exemption to mask wearing so take that as you will.</p>

        <p>Quite a few people out there posting bad reviews on businesses for not having tight enough restrictions or not everyone in the store social distancing or wearing a mask... even if they actually were following the guidelines, doomers don't care because nothing is good enough. Highly doubt google/facebook etc. are censoring keywords in those cases because they are pro-lockdown.</p>
<p>Seems like a great idea to turn it around on them and post bad reviews to businesses for the ridiculously bad and rude "customer service" that they are dolling out every day. Big corps probably still won't care, but many of the smaller businesses will start to have a change of heart once they start seeing their ratings slide and constantly having to reply to complaints.</p>

        <p>The karen thing is so dumb. People that surround and harrass others like in OPs story are the ones that are the epitome of the "karen" mindset. But somehow social media has flipped it around to be the exact opposite as soon as being a corona doomer became trendy. More 1984 doublespeak kind of stuff where everything is the opposite or contradicts itself.</p>

        <p>I've been thinking about that too. A Karen is someone who threatens you with punishment from an authority and sticks their nose in other people's business.</p>
<p>A Karen wants you to lose your job cause your store ran out of pickles.</p>
<p>A Karen threatens to call the cops on you because you've been sitting in your car outside of your friend's house for too long, so you must be a criminal.</p>
<p>You know what else a Karen would do? Harass people shopping for not following the latest mandate. Or call the cops on you for having people over. </p>
<p>How am I a Karen for just wanting you to leave me the fuck alone and let me live my life?</p>

        <p>You nailed it. We need more of you out there. There's a war being waged against humanity. I truly admire your courage and tenacity. It's so important to share these experiences and to show others that it IS possible to disobey and reject these draconian measures and come away feeling empowered that you stuck by your principles.

<p>As long as you acknowledge that its about you CHOOSING not to do it because you don't WANT to, rather than some made-up BS after the fact to falsely justify your desires. If you don't want to, just say so. Don't call it barbaric and criminal. It's not.</p>

<p>Masks aren't invasive. They're a piece of cloth over your face. Unless you're doing intense physical activity, they won't inhibit your breathing.</p>

<p>It's not a tin foil hat. Tin foil hats are a made-up solution to a made-up problem. Surgeons and nurses wear masks for a reason: because they do the job they're supposed to do.</p>
<p>&rt;just to fit in with society.</p>
<p>You're not doing it to "fit in". You're doing it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNeYfUTA11s">limit the range any spit you're flinging</a> from breathing, talking, coughing, or laughing.</p>

        <p>Considering that they surrounded me and demanded I put one on shows it is done to make people "fit in". Again the guy who confronted me wasn't even wearing what you would consider a mask. Baclava's get dirty fast and in terms of germs it is a super spreader and he was touching it a lot because it would go into his lips and he would have to pull it out but after that he would have to pull it down from his nose, it was quite comical actually due to the stupidity of it all. The other employee's mask wasn't even properly fitted rendering it useless.</p>
<p>If they were going to kick me out based on not wearing a mask they both should have been sent home for not wearing it properly or even have an actual mask. That is why I was like, "Fuck this b.s." because if they weren't even following the rules properly why should I even acknowledge the rule? </p>
<p>If they were consistent fine, but it was clear this has nothing to do with "prevention" or "safety" it is all about compliance and theater.</p>

        <p>I didn't say it was barbaric. It may be criminal in a sense, though. There is a likelihood that wearing a mask and adjusting it with your hands, and not washing or discarding it after a few hours (like people in a medical profession are supposed to do) could be harmful to your health. </p>
<p>Okay, getting into the semantics of it. Yea not "invasive," but saying anything covering your face and mouth isn't intrusive is a lie. </p>
<p>Well you could argue masks for the general population is also a made up solution to a made up problem, especially if you consider that it's unlikely someone who's asymptomatic and not coughing can spread the virus. And there's not any evidence it spreads through aerosals.</p>
<p>Masks are all just security theater. Most people are wearing masks to fit into society and to comply with what they're being told to do.</p>

<p>True, that was another commenter.</p>
<p>&rt;It may be criminal in a sense, though.</p>
<p>No, it really isn't.</p>
<p>&rt;There is a likelihood that wearing a mask and adjusting it with your hands, and not washing or discarding it after a few hours (like people in a medical profession are supposed to do) could be harmful to your health.</p>
<p>Which is why the CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html">has specific instructions</a> on mask wearing, including: not touching your mask while wearing it, washing your hands after touching it, washing your mask or swapping it out regularly, how to safely take off and put on your mask.</p>
<p>&rt;Yea not "invasive," but saying anything covering your face and mouth isn't intrusive is a lie.</p>
<p>By your definition of "intrusive", literally anything could be argued to be intrusive, so it's a meaningless and whiny complaint. A seatbelt, pants, drivers license, hair tie, or gloves could all be argued to be intrusive, yet there are well-established rules and norms for when those items are required. A mask is minimally intrusive; a piece of cloth that goes over your face. Complaining about it, especially when other nations like Japan and China have an understanding that they're sometimes necessary until conditions change, is ridiculous. It reeks of entitlement to me.</p>
<p>&rt;Well you could argue masks for the general population is also a made up solution to a made up problem, especially if you consider that it's unlikely someone who's asymptomatic and not coughing can spread the virus.</p>
<p>Source for this? Because after a quick search <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2020/08/10/asymptomatic">I've found very much the opposite</a>. The <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2009758">New England Journal of Medicine</a> takes asymptomatic spread seriously.</p>
<p>&rt;And there's not any evidence it spreads through aerosals.</p>
<p>Interesting <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html">that the CDC is claiming that's how it spreads</a> then.</p>

&rt;The Chinese mainly wear them due to air pollution and in those circumstances there is some logic behind that but in terms of preventing infection when the virus will literally pass right through especially through aerosols which mask DO NOT block.</p>

<p>And this is an excuse for apathy how? The whole "no new normal" argument CAN'T be based off of "well, we can't prevent all spread so might as well do nothing", right? Because that would be extraordinarily stupid. </p>
<p>&rt; in terms of preventing infection when the virus will literally pass right through especially through aerosols which mask DO NOT block. </p>
<p>Masks have variable effectiveness, it's true. But wanna know something interesting? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNeYfUTA11s">Some protection is better than none</a>! It's almost like this isn't a binary issue, where spread either always happens or always doesn't, like the issue is... I don't know... a smidge more complex than just "yes or no"! </p>
<p>Wearing a mask does not prevent droplets from escaping your face, but each successively better type of mask cuts the distance you may be spreading droplets significantly, preventing spread. WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT.</p>
<p>Christ on a cracker, why do I have to explain such simple concepts to ya'll? Seriously, just THINK about this for 5 fucking seconds and the answer is really apparent.</p>

<p>The gentleman who escorted me out barely had anything covering both his nose and mouth that was also lightly covered in saliva and he was constantly touching it. Worse he was working in the cooler handling various foods that are susceptible to contamination hence why they're in the cooler yet here he is getting his saliva all over whatever he touched.</p>
<p>I explained to him what he was doing and he made no attempt to remedy his error which defeats the whole purpose of the mask mandate. It's like washing your hands after taking a shit and sticking you hand back in the toilet thinking its clean because you flushed it.</p>

        <p>&rt;No you're incorrect. Fauci and Birx predicted in March that there could be up to 2.2 million deaths. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"<em>The famed 2.2 million estimate first reached viral status in the March 31 White House briefing by Doctors Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx. They displayed a graph with two bell‐​shaped epidemic curves placed on top of each other. Both curves estimate deaths per day which rise to a peak and then fall.</em>"<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;As far as anecdotal evidence it is entirely relevant since I see it in virtually every establishment, people wearing it on there chin or having there nose exposed. Fauci himself was caught flouting the rules (mask on chin, not social distancing) watching the Nationals game where he screwed up the first pitch about as bad as his prediction.</p>

<p>Christ, <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/did-mitigation-save-two-million-lives">FOLLOWING THE FUCKING LINK IN THAT SENTENCE</a>! </p>
<p>&rt; Where did the two curves come from? At first, many thought the estimates came from the White House experts. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/white-house-coronavirus-expert-predicts-up-to-200000-us-coronavirus-deaths.html">CNBC </a>reported, “Dr. Birx said the projections by Dr. Anthony Fauci that U.S. deaths could range from 1.6 million to 2.2 million deaths is a worst‐​case scenario if the country did ‘nothing’ to contain the outbreak, but said even ‘if we do things almost perfectly,’ she still predicts up to 200,000 U.S. deaths.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The steep curve with 2.2 million deaths was not from Dr. Fauci, however, but from Neal Ferguson’s team at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">Imperial College</a> London. </p>

<p>I won't argue more semantics with you. But I will say there's a reason people don't like things covering their face, and I shouldn't need to have to defend why that's different from a seatbelt or anything else, or defend why I wouldn't want another intrusive thing to be intrusive when it's not based off of science and is being used as security theater. </p>
<p>After further research I will concede that it is probable it's spread through aerosols. However according to experts, true aerosol transmission even outdoors [still seems unlikely] (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768396) – otherwise the spread of the virus would have a different dynamic and, contrary to reality, would often be untraceable.</p>
<p>And asymptomatic transmission is very rare, but I will concede there is presymptomatic spread and that's where the cause for alarm is. However if you're not coughing or yelling in someone's face it's unlikely you'll spread it anyways.</p>

<p>Which is different from mask-wearing requirements "being criminal". That's not semantics; that's definitional.</p>
<p>&rt;I shouldn't need to have to defend why that's different from a seatbelt or anything else</p>
<p>You do when health care officials are adamant that masks are the key tool to reducing spread.</p>
<p>&rt;when it's not based off of science and is being used as security theater.</p>
<p>Except you literally concede in the next few sentences that it <em>is</em> based on science, but you offer nothing but "it's unlikely" to counter that.</p>
<p>Wear your fucking mask.</p>
<p>Why is this such a struggle? Just do a little thing for other people in case you're asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. I don't <strong>like</strong> wearing it either, but I do it because if I'm infected and don't know I'd rather not give it to someone who may not have as robust an immune system as I do.</p>
<p>&rt; Also in Asian countries people will wear them when sick, not all the time. </p>
<p>And what happens when you're infectious but don't yet KNOW you're sick?</p>

<p>Masks stop globs of spit from being spewed, not aerosols. Masks don't stop small particles containing the virus, or stop them from going around the mask. Some masks like a balaclava or bandana are actually worse than not wearing anything.</p>

<p>No, but you feel the need to believe this because you don't want to wear a mask and will find any excuse that gives you a moral justification not to. </p>
<p>&rt; Masks stop globs of spit from being spewed, not aerosols. Masks don't stop small particles containing the virus, or stop them from going around the mask. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNeYfUTA11s">Except they do</a>. If your contention is that they're not 100% effective, then you're not worth talking to, since nearly NO protective measure is 100% effective. The point is spread reduction, and always has been. Demanding 100% effectiveness before you'll deign to put on a mask is absurd and selfish. </p>
<p>&rt;Some masks like a balaclava or bandana are actually worse than not wearing anything. </p>
<p>I'm not sure about balaclavas, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0wu9TOQQaU&amp;t=125s">but you're objectively wrong about bandanas</a>, so you're probably wrong about both. </p>
<p>&rt; Masks are primarily symbolic and about showing solidarity, as faucci himself stated. </p>
<p>This is a flat fucking lie, and it reveals exactly how lazy you are. I imagine you just saw this somewhere and didn't bother to check the context, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/27/politics/fauci-coronavirus-wear-masks-cnntv/index.html">so I'll do it for you</a>:</p>
<p>&rt;  Dr. Anthony Fauci on Wednesday called for a cautious approach to reopening the US and implored Americans to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/politics/donald-trump-covid-masks-politics-health/index.html">wear face masks in public</a>, comments that are at odds with President Donald Trump's push to have America quickly return to normalcy.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;"<strong>I want to protect myself and protect others</strong>, and also because I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that's the kind of thing you should be doing," Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, told CNN's Jim Sciutto on "Newsroom."<strong>Fauci said he believes that while wearing a mask is not "100% effective," it is a valuable safeguard</strong> and shows "respect for another person." </p>
<p>So you completely ignored all other context surrounding his words to cherry-pick what you wanted to hear. That's a lie of omission.</p>
<p>Maybe you should just stop arguing. You're constantly demonstrably wrong or outright lying, and I'm getting tired of fact-checking your lazy ass.</p>

        <p>In my county, i have a 99.9% chance of not getting the rona and a 99.99% chance of not dying from it. I don't wear masks and am harassed daily. I look at people, probably people much like yourself, like they are fucking braindead retarded. You can see in their eyes when you've broke them, it's hilarious. </p>

        <p>Except Bucketmaster69 didn't lie and nothing was taken out of context. He may have condensed Fauci's quote but it was not taken out of context. You highlighted what you thought was relevant to support your argument but the other part of the sentence supports Bucketmaster69's point. "</p>
<p>"I want to protect myself and protect others, and also because <strong>I want to make it be a symbol for people to see that that's the kind of thing you should be doing."</strong> Fauci said he believes that while wearing a mask is not "100% effective," it is a valuable safeguard <strong>and shows "respect for another person"</strong></p>
<p><em>"Masks are</em> <strong><em>primarily symbolic</em></strong> <em>and about</em> <strong><em>showing solidarity</em></strong><em>, as faucci himself stated."</em></p>
<p>The solidarity aspect comes from interpreting "<strong>that's the kind of thing you should be doing."</strong> Most definitely promoting conformity. Might not have been verbatim but it is still fairly accurate. </p>
<p>Going to a study published by the WHO which admits : "<em>WHO, together with the scientific community, has been actively</em> <strong><em>discussing and evaluating whether SARS-CoV-2 may also spread through aerosols in the absence of aerosol generating procedures</em></strong><em>, particularly in indoor settings with poor ventilation."</em>  </p>
<p>They still have NOT come to a consensus on transmission through aerosols.</p>
<p>"<em>The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated</em> <strong><em>hypotheses</em></strong> <em>about</em> <strong><em>possible mechanisms</em></strong> <em>of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols.(13-16)</em> <strong><em>These theories suggest</em></strong> <em>that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (&lt;5 µm) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2  required to cause infection in another person</em> <strong><em>are not known</em></strong><em>, but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses.(17)"</em></p>
<p>So in laymans terms: They don't know, at the very least, how COVID is transmitted or if it is transmitted through aerosols.</p>
<p>Moving on: "<em>One experimental study quantified the amount of droplets of various sizes that remain airborne during normal speech. However, the authors acknowledge that this relies on the independent action hypothesis,</em> <strong><em>which has not been validated for humans and SARS-CoV-2</em></strong><strong>."</strong></p>
<p>They have not validated means of transmission to justify the mandates for mask.</p>
<p><em>"Another recent experimental model found that healthy individuals can produce aerosols through coughing and talking (19), and another model suggested high variability between individuals in terms of particle emission rates during speech, with increased rates correlated with increased amplitude of vocalization.(20) To date,</em> <strong><em>transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by this type of aerosol route has not been demonstrated</em></strong><em>; much more research is needed given the possible implications of such route of transmission."</em></p>
<p>"<em>Some studies conducted in health care settings where symptomatic COVID-19 patients were cared for, but where aerosol generating procedures were not performed, reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples (23-28), while other similar investigations in both health care and non-health care settings found no presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA;</em>  <strong><em>no studies have found viable virus in air samples</em></strong><em>.(29-36) Within samples where SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found, the quantity of RNA detected was in</em> <strong><em>extremely low numbers</em></strong> <em>in large volumes of air and one study that found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples reported</em> <strong><em>inability to identify viable virus</em></strong><em>. (25) The detection of RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays</em> <strong><em>is not necessarily indicative of replication- and infection-competent (viable) virus that could be transmissible and capable of causing infection</em></strong><em>.(</em>37<em>)"</em></p>

        <p>Actually I wasn't wrong in the slightest. Texas's state wide mask mandate only requires masks in the event that keeping a safe distance is not possible. There was clearly enough space for me to stay far enough to be in compliance. I was unjustly removed from the premises even though I was in full compliance with the governors order per guidelines. I actually have a case for a lawsuit. Unfortunately my company went out of business so suing them would do little other than give some comfort of a moral victory with a little spending money.</p>

        <p>If I was a Karen I would have made a scene. The employee that escorted me out is the one that drew all of the attention. If he'd have helped me I would have been out of there in 10 minutes. Company lost business too. I left as they asked, no yelling or whining, nothing like that. I just walked out.</p>
