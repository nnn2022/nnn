    <strong>So I, like many in this sub, see a lot of "vax or you're a bad person" propaganda. So my question is: why?</strong>
    <p><p>I have read a million and one conspiracy theories in /r/conspiracy about this idea but I find a lot of them far-fetched. I feel there are much easier ways to, for example, cull the population than this convoluted mess happening now. So what is your best guess at why there is so much vaccine propaganda.</p>
<p>I personally don't necessarily think the vaccine is "bad" but I also think it's not necessary for most people and it should be okay for someone to refuse it for whatever reasons they choose.</p>
<p>Do you think it's really as simple as wanting to save lives? Maybe it's to make a buck? Open to ideas about this. I just don't really understand why. Cheers</p></p>

        <p>They are shills trying to sell vaccines, or people who have been brainwashed by the media to do so.</p>
<p>I'll be blunt, if it's free, and it's being heavily pushed, it is NOT in your best interest.</p>

        <p>Nope, I have irl family and friends like that. It's a litmus test for their cult of BLM/SJW/LGBT/Vote blue no matter who. If you don't give the loudest huzzah, you get thrown off of their island, so they are all performing.</p>
<p>Mixed in with a bit of isolation and depression from loser urbanites that only went to bars and parties losing the few "hobbies" they had while they segregated themselves from friends and family voluntarily.</p>
<p>Just like making your profile picture black or marching for a few days last June, it's a performance.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I tend to think this is a big part of it. Essentially like a "compliance indicator." However it's harder for me to see it as some kind of nefarious population control mechanism. It just seems like there are much easier ways to do that. I tend to have a harder time believing in theories that relate to killing large parts of the population because I have heard a lot of extreme theories in the conspiracy community that never came to pass in this vein. The ones that tend to come to pass usually involve money and control over mass murder (that's my opinion based on what I've seen but to be fair I haven't made a big list of theories that didn't pan out)</p>

        <p>This is the question we all need the answer to. And we will definitely find out. It might be as soon as next year, or it might take decades and not all of us will be around for the truth.</p>
<p>The reason why this is all most likely more than just about "a virus" or "public health" is that in order to convince the population to protect themselves, the discourse would have needed to be much more rational and calm. When we know what we know about this virus (and we've known it since March 2020), all authorities needed to do was advise people to be cautious, advise those at risk to shield themselves as much as possible and let the public know that an effective vaccine is available once it was ready. This kind of rhetoric would have been FAR LESS LIKELY to cause division amongst the population, to cause controversy, and people would have most likely followed that calm and rational advice. I am no psychologist but it does sound logical. And I'm sure those bright minds that push all these authoritarian measures would know a bit of psychology.</p>

        <p>There are a bunch of viable theories.</p>
<p>They want to make money.  Boomers are dying and Gen X is small so big pharma are finding out how to make money off millennial and zoomers.</p>
<p>Depopulation is another one with a fair amount of evidence.  Comes in two flavors:  kill all the useless idiots with vaccines; and kill all the free thinking types with a new disease that the Vax protects against thats actually deadly.</p>
<p>Politicians saving face from overreacting to a seasonal flu.</p>

        <p>I think it's a mixture of different things, not necessarily a well orchestrated plan to enslave mankind. </p>
<p>We have people who are tired of this virus paranoia so they'd gladly take any medication if that could stop the pandemic.
We have big pharmas that are orgasming for the insane amount of profit they're making, so they'll do whatever in their power to milk this cow as long as possible, for example by investing in a pro-vax campaign on media 
Also, I noticed, over the last 20 years, an increasingly "faith" in science. It's not a discipline anymore, it's something idolized, fanaticism, if you will. This lead to arrogance, to the wrong belief that science is unerring.</p>
<p>This might turn quite quickly into something terribly wrong, a huge mistake.</p>
<p>For the world domination plan, I think the big names, the companies and the billionaires, just see this as an opportunity to make more money, they're just like vultures flying around the next rotting carcass they've smelled.  Nothing else.</p>

        <p>It is an argument about solidarity in our society. Even if you are not as likely to get complications as someone else, you should get it so you don't spread the virus to people with higher mortality.</p>
<p>Additionally, getting the vaccine not only prevents you from infection, but also reduces rate and severity of long term or permanent health complications, which can fuck you over even if you are young. In the case of covid, your lung tissue can be scarred, leaving you with a lower lung capacity.</p>
<p>Anyway, in my opinion it is false to say you are a bad person just because you don't get the vaccine. But for me, you are a good and solidary person if you do get it, even if you don't need it for yourself.</p>

        <p>Depends in the vaccine. The range goes from 60% to 95% lower chance of being infected compared to an unvaccinated person in the same situation. That is not perfect, but still pretty good imo.</p>

<p>It should be common knowledge that no vaccine or drug works perfectly. But mRNA is pretty good with 95%: <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/23510/estimated-effectiveness-of-covid-19-vaccine-candidates/">https://www.statista.com/chart/23510/estimated-effectiveness-of-covid-19-vaccine-candidates/</a></p>

<p>Actually, yes. I come from a future where we know that long term complications not necessarily only appear after a long time, but can also appear after a short time and stay for a long time. In case of corona, lung complications. But knowing that people eith vaccine get lung complications with lesser chance is already known at your timeline.</p>

<p>I don't know how this pandemic will develop, but corona will probably become endemic, and blend in with the seasonal influenza. The vaccines are only for this gap period, so that we gain enough immunity in the society to end the pandemic. After that, only people who are prone to corona will need it.</p>

<p>It's the same reasons we don't have a single influenza vaccine or one for the common cold - the virus seems to mutate too quickly.</p>
<p>And, even if you had no vaccine hesitancy, it is logistically impossible to inoculate enough of the population soon enough.  </p>
<p>And, even if you were able to inoculate 100% of the world population, you still have to worry about the animal pools.</p>
<p>You're also forgetting that Herd Immunity is a composite and vaccines aren't the only way we can achieve it.  This is why people are advocating more studies (and proper ones) on existing drugs.</p>
<p>One hope is that the current strain will flame out and be less severe over time.</p>

<p>It's not only that, but there are hundereds of influenza variants. Therefore, influenza vaccine is seasonal and a mix of vaccines against the current variants. As I said, corona will probably blend into them, and therefore the corona vaccine will be integrated into the seasonal influenza vaccine. From then on, only old people etc. really need it.</p>
<p>We just need the corona vaccine now so that we develop some immunity so that not everyone get sick at the same time.</p>
