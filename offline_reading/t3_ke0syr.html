    <strong>I am an ICU doctor. I am weary of getting the vaccine.</strong>
    <p><p>ICU doctors are first in line for the vaccines. I'm terrified. I don't want it until I see the results of a couple million people getting it first. I don't want to be first. I believe in practicing evidence-based medicine. This means reading peer-reviewed journal articles and deciding for myself what is best for patients. </p>
<p>Particularly I am worried about something called antibody-dependent enhancement. </p>
<p>"COVID‐19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies may sensitise vaccine recipients to more severe disease than if they were not vaccinated. Vaccines for SARS, MERS and RSV have never been approved, and the data generated in the development and testing of these vaccines suggest a serious mechanistic concern: that vaccines designed empirically using the traditional approach (consisting of the unmodified or minimally modified coronavirus viral spike to elicit neutralising antibodies), be they composed of protein, viral vector, DNA or RNA and irrespective of delivery method, may worsen COVID‐19 disease via antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE)...This is a similar profile to immune complex‐mediated disease seen with RSV vaccines in the past, wherein vaccinees succumbed to fatal enhanced RSV disease because of the formation of antibody‐virus immune complexes that precipitated harmful, inflammatory immune responses. It is also similar to the clinical course of COVID‐19 patients, in whom severe COVID‐19 disease is associated with the development of anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 serum antibodies, with titres correlating directly with the severity of disease."</p>
<p>In plain English, it says if you get the vaccine your immune system could go into hyperdrive if you get Covid and essentially destroy your body, cause you to have a more severe case, and even kill you. </p>

<p>Given inflammatory immune responses are what cause severe cases in the first place, whoever sanctioned this is a maniac. It would be like a bird flu vaccine that gives you a cytokine storm.</p>

        <p>We are treating dying covid patients with steroids for this reason, to stop the immune system overdrive. So why would we give people a vaccine that is likely to cause this exact issue that kills people...?</p>

        <p>So that they can claim the virus mutated, chalk all the extra deaths up to the new strain and usher in the fascist technocracy that they are wet dreaming about.  At least, that's one answer, but take your pick out of all the possible agendas.</p>

        <p>Because they needed an excuse (fear) to get this out to the population and I truly believe corona wasn't meant to depopulate but the vaccine is. Bill Gates said it himself if we do a good enough job we can decrease population by something like 10-15%. I'd have to find his Ted talk.</p>

        <p>I dont do the injecting. I keep the dying patients from dying. It still is a free country (for now) and covid vaccine is not mandatory. I could always find another job if my job says vaccine or fired. I wouldn't lose my career because of the high need for my specialty and low amounts of people that can do the job</p>

        <p>I'm a coder and I'm worried about this. Luckily we don't come into contact with patients so I'm praying my docs don't make it mandatory for us administration people. If they say mandatory I'll have to quit. Coders can work remote and there are plenty of jobs. This terrifies me and not all of us healthcare personnel want this vaccine.</p>

        <p>reminder, that while getting from an insane idea to the final vaccine might take 10 years the actual final studies might just be days in length actually.</p>
<p>one example is the hepatitis b vaccine engerix-b.</p>
<p>it's study length was 4 days!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/119403/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/119403/download</a> </p>
<p>&rt; In 36 clinical studies, a total of 13,495 doses of ENGERIX-B were administered to 5,071 healthy adults and children who were initially seronegative for hepatitis B markers, and healthy neonates. All subjects were monitored for 4 days post-administration.  </p>
<p>you died on the 5th day after getting the vaccine, then it wasn't the vaccine (in regards to the study's data)</p>
<p>you developed an auto immune disease in 6 months or a year? won't get looked at, because it only ran for 4 days.</p>
<p>in comparison other medications like heart medications  will go through 4-6 year long RCTs. that is just the study length  of their safety study.</p>
<p>so just in case, that you thought, that other vaccines actually went through ANY proper safety testing and that just those covid-19 vaccines get insanely rushed through, that is not the case.</p>
<p>the covid-19 "vaccines" are just a levelup from an already insane system, that has nothing to do with any proper safety testing at all whatsoever.</p>

        <p>Can I ask you a question requiring your expertise? If someone gets the covid vaccine, does that mean they will test positive for it afterwards? The only thing I have to base this on is cats. I got a stray cat and the vet told me if the cat tests positive for feline leukemia it either has it or has been vaccinated against it but they both show up as a positive. Do you know if this is true for humans as well, for covid and for the covid mRNA vaccine?</p>

        <p>They <em>do</em> expose the virus to those given the vaccine and the placebo group... That's how they test its efficacy... Straight from Pfizer's FDA submission: 7 days after the initial dose they recorded "8 COVID-19 cases in the BNT162b2 [active] group compared to 162 COVID-19 cases in the placebo." I recommend reading the report for yourself. Src: <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144246/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/144246/download</a></p>
<p>Also in reference to severe cases, " A total of 10 cases of severe COVID-19 occurred after Dose 1, <strong>1 in the BNT162b2 group</strong>, compared with 9 cases in the placebo group."  So again, the results support that vaccinated people had fewer infections and less severity. Not the other way around as stated above.</p>

<p>Edit: Clarification: Participants are exposed in external settings, not directly and on purpose. </p>
<p>But my point stands.</p>

        <p>My understanding is that these “cases” (in the Pfizer trial) happened naturally without the participants being purposefully exposed. </p>
<p>What is being talked about here is what is typically called a challenge study. This is normally only done on animal trials, it is considered unethical to do in human trials. In a challenge study, participants are purposefully exposed to the virus. It is really the only accurate way to test a vaccine’s effectiveness</p>

        <p>Well what is a vaccine designed to do - prevent you getting a disease when exposed to it. So the only way to test it is by exposing a large enough sample size of vaccinated and unvaccinated people to the virus and seeing if there is a statistically significant difference in the outcome. </p>
<p>You can do longer term studies of large populations, vaccinated and unvaccinated and let them go about their lives and see who ends up getting the disease. But this rehires extremely large test groups for the results to be significant.</p>

        <p>I was aware of that but I was told that having a control group with placebo vaccine took care of that. Is the issue because the virus exposure rates are just too low to get statistically meaningful results unless people are exposed intentionally? Or is it due to not knowing how many people were exposed in the placebo group vs the vaccine group?</p>
<p>Something else?</p>

        <p>I watched a very interesting video on this. And basically they don't expose humans to the live virus because it's unethical.. But in animal trials for previous coronavirus vaccines that they were working on, when they exposed the animals (cats and ferrets I think were some of them) the response that OP talked about happened - ADE. And killed most of the test animals. So those vaccines never made it to human trials. But fast forward to 2020 and this horrible "pandemic" and they skipped the animal trials (at least that's what I've heard) and went straight to humans! Sounds super safe! 🙄</p>

        <p>When I first researched this type of vaccine, I was shocked to realize this problem is the reason we've never released one to the public. It's terrifying. And now we've fast tracked one. Yippee. I don't even work with the public, at all, but my corporation went crazy on us anyway and they make billions. So I'm sure they'll find a way to get us vaccines and make them mandatory. We have stockpiles of masks and sanitizer that we could never use.</p>

        <p>If enough people refuse they won’t be able to staff the hospitals.  Since most hospitals already have trouble staffing, smart administrators will see that if even a small percentage of vaccine refusers were dismissed their hospitals would be toast.  Stand your ground.</p>

        <p>I am super concerned about the risk of ADE as well.  I have been locked in my house since March, and I want a safe, effective vaccine more than anything, but I don’t want to get one until there is a definitive answer about whether or not these vaccines cause ADE.  Both Moderna and Pfizer have it buried at the end of their reports to the FDA that they don’t yet know whether ADE will be a problem.  Why is no one talking about this?  It’s a pretty big fucking deal.  How long will it take to know whether this is going to be an issue?</p>

        <p>When people say to trust the experts, I usually do, but when you mentioned the potential sensitivity to other diseases it clicked for me. How could they test that? I know you can run tests and extrapolate data but that's still theoretical and not real life and with enough sample size. My god. </p>

        <p>i don’t think it has to be a right wing vs left wing political argument to be concerned about ADE.  Many left wingers are antivaxxer as are right.  In this case it’s not even an antivaxxer issue, but more of a decision of which risk you prefer?  If you are an older diabetic or cancer or whatever then i think it’s easy to say get the vaccine, because risk of death is significant.  It is someone with zero to few risk factors where you are getting a vaccine that probably stops disease (at least as long as the 2-4 months in the studies) but may or may not stop infection or transmission, where you still will be expected to social distance and wear masks, with a possibly zero to a possibly unquantified risk of ADE in the coming months to years with a virus that can mutate.  So to me also, i have the same concern as OP and i’m really torn whether to get the shot or not.</p>

        <p>Wary*
Weary would suggest you are tired of receiving so much of the vaccine and when considering the point that you are making, that’s rather ironic.
You could become weary of discussing it? Maybe that’s what you were meaning?</p>
<p>The literature review you cited states it “may sensitise vaccine recipients” and I would like to point out, as you so clearly missed it, that the single academic paper used as “evidence” for this aforementioned statement has since been heavily corrected due to huge errors in results.</p>
<p>It’s possibly food for thought for myself and others that do not share your stance as I’m of the opinion that it’s always good to read opposing literature for a balanced view of a topic.
However, in saying that, this entire sub is a total nightmare and I am 100% getting my vaccine.</p>
<p>Also, here in the UK, participants in stage III trials were actively recruited from the country’s pool of practicing healthcare workers who would naturally be exposed to the virus.</p>
