    <strong>Fauci on Masks - They don't come off until Virus is "No Threat at All" - which is... NEVER???</strong>
    <p><p>This guy is amazing - check out Fauci's latest discussion on masks...</p>
<p>Read the source article (below) and watch the vid in the article and look at Dr Fauci's body language and his slight smirk when asked the reporter asks him question "will there ever be a time without masks?"</p>
<p>&rt;Fauci said, “That will really be dependent upon how we get the level of the virus in the community down. If we can get — and I have used this as an estimate, <strong>it is not definitive</strong> — if we can get 70 to 85 percent of the population vaccinated and get to what we would hope would be to a degree of herd immunity, which really is an umbrella or a veil of protection against the community. <strong>Where the level of virus is so low, it’s not a threat at all.</strong> Then at that point, you can <strong>start thinking</strong> in terms of not having to have a <strong>uniform</strong> wearing of masks.” He added, “But we’re certainly not near there yet. <strong>When do I think that would occur? It’s very difficult to predict</strong>, Bret, but <strong>if everything falls into the right place</strong> and we get this under control, it is <strong>conceivable</strong> that you <strong>might</strong> be able to pull back a bit on some of the public health measures as we get into the late fall of this year. <strong>But there’s no guarantee of that.</strong>”</p>
<p>How many disclaimers does this guy need to give? We all know you are lying to us, Dr Fauci, so why keep up the charade? </p>
<p><strong>Clearly Fauci expects us to be in masks for the rest of our lives</strong> since there will never be a time when the virus is actually "no threat at all" since he will just keep moving the goal posts indefinitely to keep us under control. </p>

        <p>I agree and I have been saying it countless times quite honestly, I have only worn a face diaper only once and that was for a doctors appointment and I wanted to be respectful... it's insane to think that people wear them in the car driving alone or outside when there is barely anyone outdoors</p>

        <p>You should see how it is where I am. Everyone wears one without a second thought. I've started not wearing one until asked and then take it off to make them ask again.</p>
<p>I'll wear one because I need to purchase things still, but civil disobedience is the only way the insanity ends</p>

As far as I'm concerned there is no virus, so I don't wear a mask.<br>
Also, I've never seen any factual evidence that a covid19 virus exists.</p>

        <p>You know, back in March and April of last year, I went out of my way to find the cute masks that I could wear that matched my outfits or had holiday or sports team logos. By mid-summer, I realized my insanity and the wasted money. I rationalized it that I would use them after Covid in the same manner as bandannas- over my face during daily livestock chores (dust, allergens). But right now, I am repulsed by the thought. I will never, ever, spend another penny on a mask.</p>

        <p>It’s a huge cope. Everyone is waiting for someone else to do something while keeping their own heads down. I stopped frequenting these subs when the unwavering consensus was “after the election everything will go back to normal.”</p>
<p>I hope people are coming around to ACTIVELY making an effort to change the minds of people around them. So long as we’re atomized and under the impression that “everyone else agrees with masks, lockdowns, etc.,” it’s not going to end.</p>

        <p>True, but I imagine most people are starting to get very tired of all this, even some doomers.  That combined with widespread vaccine rollout I think will cause people to start to test the waters. While I don't expect everything to suddenly go back to normal, I do expect there to be some decrease in following restrictions. The media and the government will do everything they can to try to dissuade people and scare them, but normal people don't want to live like hermits and need social interaction.</p>

        <p>Every time I put this filthy face diaper on, it is a slap in the face reminder of how we are destroying everything good about life because idiots are irrationally panicked and have not updated their viewpoints since march 2020. Instead of opening their eyes and the brains to look at the data themselves, all they an do is parrot what the TV says and clap like seals pretending like their masks give them control, despite exactly zero evidence anywhere on the planet showing it has mattered one way or the other.</p>
<p>So it's not about the mask, the mask is simply a symbol. Every time I put it on against my will, is another reminder of how I am being forced to comply with a BULLSHIT narrative. I may as well be wearing a swastika armband in 1930's germany while cheering on the fuher that is going to "save" us all.</p>

        <p>&rt; Every time I put this filthy face diaper on</p>
<p>Your masks become filthy easily? I'm sure there's workarounds for that--you aren't supposed to own just 1 mask for the entirety of the pandemic. I'd be happy to send you some new ones free of charge if that's the problem.</p>
<p>To your other points, it really seems like a personal problem that you feel a certain way when you put the mask on? I find that interesting. I feel nothing when I put mine on. It's literally the simplest thing ever, I never knew people were having meltdowns and full-blown existential crises, nightmares of Nazis, etc. when asked to wear a mask during a pandemic. How utterly odd. Honestly, I hate to be that guy, but this seems concerning to me and I'd consider talking with a therapist. Dead serious, not trying to be snarky or use that as an attack.</p>

        <p>I didn't come here for a debate or your advice. I answered your question on what I feel every time I am forced to put this shit on against my will. And the answer is Hate. I hate every single person who forces this bullshit on others. I am not interested in solutions, I am interested in having my life back and not cowering to paranoid morons.</p>

        <p>It's hot, humid, constantly slipping. the bottom of my vision is blocked. To say it is not an inconvenience is laughable. Do you wear it while you sleep? Why not? Because it's less comfortable? There's your answer</p>

        <p>I haven't felt this way one bit--I live in a colder climate though so who knows, maybe it just feels nice to have a bit of extra warmth? I'll certainly give you the benefit of the doubt that you feel that way when you wear one.  </p>
<p>I do not wear it while sleeping... not because it would be uncomfortable but because I see no benefit to it. I'd be happy to try for you as an experiment. Have you seen the stories of people running marathons with masks on and things like that?</p>
<p>I guess even if it was uncomfortable, which I don't find it to be, I'm just willing to be slightly uncomfortable out of respect for people around me. I'm sorry if you don't feel that way (and I feel sorry for you, as well. No offense intended but this way of thinking strikes me as profoundly sad).</p>

        <p>I struggle breathing in it &amp; have yet to met someone who says it's not inconveniencing him in breathing. It's like being chokeholded in fabric to me at least. I'm wary of breathing in plastic particles in  medical ones. It looks like toilet paper stuck on your face. Why forgone breathing the way nature intended...  So many great reasons not to wear one... What to do when you have to sneeze? Some people literally sneezes in it and leave it soak. I non-stop touch it with my hands 'cause I'm not hyperaware of my motions &amp; surroundings  and I re-use it 'cause I don't see myself throwing money on these ugly abominations or washing a whole washing machine of it. This is also I presume majority of people modus operandi - so it's doing the opposite of what is supposed to do. There's truly no upside to this. But I bet you still gonna use it as a talking point...</p>

        <p>Sorry for the shitty replies you’re getting. Like anywhere else on Reddit we have our fair share of morons. </p>
<p>To answer your question though, on top of finding several articles, and peer reviewed studies stating that typical masks are ineffective I don’t like the feeling of essentially wearing a muzzle. </p>
<p>With a recent study that found that asymptomatic spread is virtually impossible, the requirement to wear a mask to combat this is moronic. There’s even a statement on the box of these things that say they aren’t effective at filtering much more than dust. </p>
<p>Furthermore, they’re extremely wasteful, producing a metric ass ton of pollution. I went for a hike with my dog last week and the entire parking lot and many parts of the park were littered with masks. </p>
<p>TL;DR </p>
<p>I don’t like covering my face, the reasoning behind the mandates is shady at best, and they cause a lot of pollution</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply. I strongly, strongly disagree with you as I've seen that a majority of evidence on mask-wearing disagrees with your claims; one or two studies to the contrary notwithstanding. I'm sure we could get into a source battle and send them back and forth. However, I do appreciate you being polite.  </p>
<p>Probably my favorite of your arguments is the pollution which I do agree is a HUGE issue and I hate seeing masks littering sidewalks and parking lots, only to end up God knows where. However, I have to say that the argument of disliking covering your face is kind of something my response to would be "too bad." Minor personal irritation in the face of a global pandemic is nothing. Now I kind of get where you would take that as it being forced upon you and authoritarian and everything, but I really really really don't think it's a big deal to have common courtesy during a pandemic. Honestly, I think it's a little offensive to people that have actually been through fascism and genocides and totalitarian regimes to compare this to that (this is a more general statement as I know you haven't exactly made this comparison in your post).  </p>
<p>You still haven't explained to me exactly how you feel while wearing a mask; you've said it feels like a "muzzle"--this is again just so odd to me as someone who can wear one for hours--in fact, I've seen the people on this subreddit making fun of people who wear their masks while alone in cars. I've done this--to me I can literally forget I have it on, or I just have a short drive and will have to put it on again, so it's not worth taking off, because again it barely even feels like anything. Is this muzzled feeling a physical or symbolic feeling?</p>

        <p>Thanks; I think I only just now for the first time received a reply of what the physical feeling you guys don't like about masks is like. Someone replied saying it was hot and humid; not something I've experienced, but at least someone explaining why it's uncomfortable. Apologies for not being clearer earlier; I guess that's what I wanted. I can't even bring myself to view them as an inconvenience, to the point where I forget I have one on, so I was just a little dumfounded to see so many people with issues with them and wanted a little clarity on the feeling.  </p>
<p>People have described to me more of a moral problem with them, which also seems silly to me and I don't agree with a bit, but I think it was my fault for not clarifying whas I was asking about.</p>

        <p>The muzzle is symbolic. In reality sometimes I forget I’m wearing one. My qualms come from a. Deep mistrust in the American government after a couple of my family members got screwed over by the implementation of Obamacare. On top of the election of trump, very clear corruption in the FBI, CIA, and SEC, and the constant fear mongering by the media. </p>
