    <strong>Floridians: How is it going down there?</strong>
    <p><p>Are there any Floridians who can give us a first-hand account of how it's going down there?  </p>
<p>I've seen the data.  Case counts and death count keep going down.  </p>
<p>I compare this with New York, or in our country Ontario and Quebec.  Ontario and Quebec in particular have been under a strict lockdown for over three months now, <em>and cases keep going up.</em> Which of course has led to further restrictions.  We have an 8pm curfew in Quebec for example.</p>
<p>In Florida, are people really living life like "normal"?  No masks?  No social distancing?  When you go into a store, no mask?  For real?</p>
<p>How about vaccines?  Have many people been vaccinated?  What's their feeling about vaccines?  </p>
<p>How is it possible rates keep going down?  How can the authorities explain this?  Why isn't this National News??  "Great news guys, turns out the cure for covid is to do nothing.  Sorry, our bad."</p>
<p>I just really want to hear a Floridian tell me what it's like these days in Florida.  Is it fully back to normal, or are things still weird?  What's your explanation for why the numbers keep dropping?  And why aren't the authorities talking about this more?</p></p>

        <p>Hey I live in NE Florida.  Every time I've been to a store all the employees have to wear a mask, many of the shoppers do to. Probably 70% do, 30% don't, kind of estimating those numbers of course.  Occasionally I'll see someone enter a restaurant with a mask on but it isn't required, 90% of people don't use masks when going out to eat (it's going to be off 99% of the time you are at the restaurant so what's the point?)</p>
<p>All businesses have been fully opened for many months without restriction, masks are not required by law so I've never seen anyone say anything.  Meeting up with friends for dinner and a get together in a few days.  Going to see the new mortal kombat at the theater when it comes out.  So it's not totally normal yet, but we're getting there.</p>
<p>In terms of vaccines there is a big push but our governor has rejected vaccine passports.  My companies stance is that a vaccine is each person/families decision.  I would estimate 80% will get a vaccine, lots of people talk about it and many say they won't be getting it until we know more about them.</p>
<p>As far why the rates keep going down... I'm not an expert on this stuff.  My best guess would be that businesses have been open for so long, the restaurants and stores are constantly packed that we reached herd immunity to a larger extent than other places.  Our high covid numbers towards the beginning of all this seem to suggest that with the latest data.</p>

        <p>Interesting.  Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>So even movie theatres are open?  Wow.  In Quebec that's like a laughable proposition.  Anyway, when would you go to a movie if you aren't allowed to be outside after 8pm anyway?</p>
<p>Glad to hear small businesses were allowed to stay open.  Do you know if they are back to 100%?  Or like 80%?</p>
<p>Do you know anyone who has had covid?  Did they recover?</p>
<p>It just feels like a totally different world there compared to here.  Here, it feels like the military is going to be moving in at any moment.  It's like a dystopian novel over here.</p>

        <p>A lot of businesses closed entirely (like movie theaters) when this all started last March. Restaurants were carry out only, etc.  Then restaurants and businesses opened to 50% and then 100% immediately followed by the mask mandates being lifted.  </p>
<p>A few of my coworkers had it, they were sick and took a few days off work but they all recovered.  </p>
<p>My company is still doing 100% remote work and I'm on a team with members spread out all over the country so I don't expect to ever be allowed to go back to the office (I don't mind that at all, though, as long as we're able to continue living a normal life on the weekends).</p>

<p>Okay, so there were mass closures.</p>
<p>&rt;Restaurants were carry out only, etc.  Then restaurants and businesses opened to 50% and then 100% immediately followed by the mask mandates being lifted.  </p>
<p>So now they are at 100%?  You can walk into a restaurant and get a meal surrounded by people then?  (Gosh, I remember those days).</p>
<p>&rt;A few of my coworkers had it, they were sick and took a few days off work but they all recovered.  </p>
<p>I'm glad to hear they were okay.  Anything note worthy coming out of these accounts?</p>

        <p>Yeah a lot things closed, no cleaning products or toilet paper for a while and all that.</p>
<p>Yeah restaurants have been back at max capacity for the last 7 or 8 months now, bars and pubs are open, the beaches opened back up quite a while ago.</p>
<p>I know they were very sick, like a bad flu but they all seem to be doing fine.</p>
<p>People still talk about covid a lot, there are still plenty of people terrified to leave their houses, but if you look around there are probably even more that arent.</p>

<p>Really?</p>
<p>So the explanation could not possibly be the vaccine either.</p>
<p>Why isn't this front page news?  "Great news guys!  Turns out we were wrong about the whole lockdown thing."</p>
<p>Oh yeah right.  They will never admit they were wrong.</p>

        <p>I think they said 30ish% of us have received 1 dose of the vaccine so far and I'd say 90% of people are going grocery shopping at minimum, there is a big music festival going on right now and it's been packed (someone else posted a picture of it on this sub reddit). If you want to know what is normal here that pretty much sums it up nicely.</p>

        <p>I’m in the Miami area. Masks indoors. Everything is open. We are living life. There are ample doomers but they’re reducing in number. Most people don’t wear masks outdoors. The mask thing is theatre for the stupid.</p>

        <p>There’s a county regulation requiring masks indoors. It’s enforced to greater and lesser degree depending on the business. At restaurants you wear the mask to the table then take it off. A lot of people do chin mask or mouth mask. I don’t wear it in my building other than the occasional chin mask to make the security happy. Definitely have to wear it on public transport. It comes up but not like it was when I was in Ontario. The overwhelming feeling of doom is mostly gone and it’s easier to pretend our overlords don’t have us in the middle of a cunning plan. </p>
<p>Moving here saved my sanity. Do it if you can. But pick a different area of Florida that’s more free ideally. I moved to Miami because I have friends here. I like it here but a county without mask mandate would be ideal.</p>

        <p>I have travelled to FL a couple of times and it depends on where you go but many places are 100% open.  You would NEVER know there is something called COVID unless you turned on the TV.  You will see masks in grocery stores but that is about it.</p>
<p>Now where I live in MO, my County is quite populous.  400,000 people.  Everything is open.  All the bars, restaurants are packed.  We do the mask theatre from walking in the front door to your table, which maybe half the people do cause its dumb to put your mask on for 10 feet of walking but hey whatever.</p>
<p>I walked into a very busy gas station this morning to get a coffee.  About 15 people in there.  Maybe 1 person was wearing a mask.  A cop walked in, not wearing a mask. Employees not wearing masks.</p>
<p>Only 464 confirmed cases in the last 14 days in my county and ZERO deaths.</p>

        <p>I don’t live in Florida, but I do live out in the country in a red state. It’s not required to wear a mask in stores, although some people choose to. You can go to a bar, drink, dance, go to the movies, play basketball indoors with friends, whatever you want; all mask free. As far as vaccines, I’d say quite a few people are getting them, although everyone I know closely is not.</p>
