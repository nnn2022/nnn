    <strong>When Doomers think they can touch women who don’t wear masks</strong>
    <p><p>“W-well you see, officer, it was what she was wearing.“</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, pro-maskers feel empowered enough to invade someone else’s personal space because they feel they have support from society (anti-social distancing suddenly disappears). All basic morals are thrown out the window for worshipping the Covidian cult. An example of this was posted in this sub some time ago, some old guy hiding in the bushes taking pictures of girls “to show they weren’t wearing masks”. So whenever I see that a Doomer picked on the wrong person in the news, and they give some sob story portraying themselves as the victim of the “anti-masker”, I have no sympathy for them.</p></p>
