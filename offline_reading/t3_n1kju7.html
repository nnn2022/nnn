    <strong>Unpopular Opinion: VAERS is doomed</strong>
    <p><p>VAERS is lighting up with vaccine reactions and quickly proving that these 'vaccines' are absolute nonsense. Being that they are indeed a credible source, being co managed by the CDC and all, this is powerful ammunition for who believe we are being hit from behind by a wooden fucking machine with no oil.</p>
<p>VAERS does not require any sort of verification to submit a vaccine report, which is great for the brigaders, right?</p>
<p>Well that's a bad thing.</p>
<p>My guess is that VAERS is going to be either heavily criticized from most post 2019 reports being made up of anti vaxxers trying to fake reports to pad an 'official source', which could very well be true.... or it will become heavily moderated where only 'doctors' and 'health care providers' can submit reports and only approved reports will be.... approved.</p>
<p>I don't think VAERS is going to last forever... at least in it's current form.</p>
<p>If my resources extended past no new normal dot win, I would be building something for the inevitable collapse, but my idea is out there for everyone who wants to take it..</p></p>

        <p>I’m sure the resource will be removed from the internet soon, unfortunately. I know medical personnel that can confirm that Covid-19 vaccine related deaths are not being recorded as such by hospitals/doctors. The same goes for adverse reactions from the so called vaccine. </p>
<p>There is a new pandemic taking place; world wide medical malpractice. </p>
<p>These things are not being officially recorded because the vaccine is big money, and any data against them would slow the increase in profits. We are experiencing what happens when we mix medicine and unchecked greed.</p>

        <p>I made an interesting discovery I was going to post about, maybe it's something, maybe not. I was looking at the case reports for the covid vaccines when I noticed the Vaers ID number at the top left. I just started comparing the numbers and noticed that they were similar but not necessarily consistent. For example the last 3 digits might look like 112, 113, 114 then 156. So curious I went back to the beginning of the cases to see if was similar. I found that there were hardly any gaps between case numbers.  So where are all the missing cases, does anyone know? Do they just show up later because they are still being filed or are they deliberately not being published?</p>

        <p>VAERS has always been criticized. I suspect it isn’t doomed and will remain, because that’s always how people have gaslit vaccine injured people. “YoU dOn’T eVeN nEeD a DoCToR tO fILe YoUR rEPoRt.” It’s been going on for ages. Why would they stop now? </p>
<p>A Harvard study estimated years ago that less than 1% of adverse events are actually reported to VAERS and the CDC ghosted them when they suggested ways to fix that. </p>
<p>Vaccine manufacturers and those in charge of public health policy <em>like</em> that VAERS doesn’t come off as a credible source, because then you keep listening to them without questioning anything.</p>

        <p>I think it’s against the law to file a false report on Vaers. If there are that many false reports filed maybe they are just scrubbing the information and not going after the people that file the false information. But I can’t imagine there are that many “anti-vaxxers” that would spend that much time filing that many false reports- but I’ve been called naive before.</p>

        <p>Yeah that would be hard to believe. In just looking at the latest 3 pages there was at least one instance of a gap of 200. So I'm not sure what is going on.</p>

        <p>Answer: Not enough information in the previous reports to have them accessible. Seriously: In order to have your report SHOW on VAERS, you have to give a whole lot of information, some of which the average person WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO such as the lot numbers of the gene therapy or vaccine they were shot up with.</p>

        <p>Anything that sheds light on the falsity of the mainstream narrative is eventually crushed. A great example of this is the rating system on Netflix, which was axed due to a high dislike ratio on a certain female comic's special. And now, YouTube is discussing the removal of their "dislike" button... While still leaving the "like" button.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something, the like button means absolutely nothing if there's no dislike button.</p>

        <p>Yes, the patients create the report.</p>
<p>But for the report to the accepted in the database it needs to be verified by medical experts before.</p>

        <p>I can’t believe that literally anyone can file a report. It’s 2021. How hard would it be to have some sort of verification system ensuring that the report is true (or at least coming from a healthcare professional, hospital, vaccine site, etc.)?</p>

        <p>They specifically do not do that because they found out years ago that health care professionals are exceptionally UNDENIABLY reticent to file reports even if someone DIED from a reaction to a vaccine.</p>
<p>That is why they still allow reports directly from private individuals who have gotten vaccinated or gene therapied.</p>
