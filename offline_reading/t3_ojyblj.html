    <strong>Reassurance for those here that are vaccinated.</strong>
    <p><p>I wanted to talk to others here that <em>have</em> been "vaccinated." (I quote that, because it isn't a vaccine, it's an RNA treatment.)</p>
<p>I think we are all against mandatory vaccinations here. And most in the sub choose not to get the shot for health and safety reasons or because they simply don't need it. </p>
<p>I just want to mention to the people who have gotten it--because their work mandated it, or they didn't know better at the time, or they genuinely wanted the immunity to protect their loved ones, that it is okay that you did it. I got the Pfeizer jabs the second I could because I'm caring for two vulnerable adults at home and 2 kids. Plus I worked in a COVID ICU with a compromised N95 for 6 months straight. I was scared, and they preyed on my vulnerability. It <em>isn't your fault.</em> The system blared in your ears in one of the largest propaganda campaigns in history, for over a <em>year straight</em> while they shut down your entire world, that you needed this thing to return to normal. Desperate, you made the bargain. There is no shame in that. These people <em>live</em> for that kind of control over you. </p>
<p>As for the health risks, and I think this is the most important take away; what's done is done. When you think of all the carcinogens, micro plastics, and chemicals you're exposed to every day, cumulatively that has a huge effect on your health too, as does diet and exercise. Yes, you might be suffering from negative effects of the vaccine, but that doesn't stop you from making healthier choices. You can't be <em>unjabbed</em> but you can eat better, exercise more, and improve your mental and spiritual health to compensate.  </p>
<p>Also, I hope that nobody here is hostile towards those that made their choice. The fight isn't with your fellow citizens. It's against the powers in control that want to dominate your life, livelihoods, and health.  Our fight isn't with one another. Our fight is a return to the world we had before China recklessly released a virus on the world and disgusting elites used it to seize more control of our lives.</p>
<p>Thank you for hearing me out.</p></p>

<p>Its a diceroll which one ends up being the right call. If gain of function is a thing here, we may well see a variant that will be fatal to anyone not vaxxed. Then again, said variant may kill the vaxxed and spare the rest</p>
<p>Place your bet. Could also just be fukkage for all btw</p>

        <p>Nothing lasting. Shot 2 gave me a 102F fever and mono like symptoms for a solid week. </p>
<p>I will say that I think people complaining of "lethargy" long term may have psychosomatic symptoms, like a self fulfilling prophecy. That's why I recommend post-jab just living your life in as normal and healthy a manner possible. You can't change the choice you made. So get active and protect your body as best you can starting now.</p>

        <p>My views have been largely consistent. I've always been anti lockdown, anti mask, and anti mandatory vaccine. </p>
<p>All that has changed is by belief that the vaccine had some sort of value, to realizing that even if it does have some benefits for at risk people, it's just been weaponized by political elites to target and attack working people. And I don't think it works nearly as well as Pfeizer ever said it did, it just decreased symptoms in some people. It's all a system of control.</p>

        <p>Cases decreased and I was able to come up for air. I wasn't directly dealing with COVID patients for 12 hours a day virtually every day. It's hard to look at facts when your physical reality is 40 patients all in a row all intubated. I sat back and realized that yes, these 40 people were sick, but there were 340,000,000 or so other people in the country that were just fine, and I needed to broaden my thinking. Also I realized that I had textbook PTSD and anxiety. So seeking treatment for those issues put things into context.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>This is exactly what I told friends was likely happening with hospital personnel. Media tells you its pandemic times and as soon as the first patient rolls in, you are in emergency mode and cant think clearly anymore. Interrestingly most people rejected the argument entirely, as if doctors are emotionless robots... Really glad you got out of that without it eating you up.</p>
<p>Im curious, how would you rate the argument that at least the early treatment of patients was way over the top and probably did more harm than good (especially the inturbations, but also medications and others)?</p>

        <p>My take on treatment: it didn't really matter. If you're getting intubated with COVID you have serious comorbidities and/or are obese, and your changes of getting out with minimal long lasting effects are 40% at best. Yes we tubed some people a little "too early" but the alternative is placing them on BiPAP or high flow cannula at literally 60 liters 100% O2 a minute, rendering them unable to eat or drink or speak for weeks at a time while they breathe 50 times a minute. </p>
<p>Sure we have delayed some time intubated but it just means that when we DO, they're completely gassed and every last bit of energy their body has is drained.</p>
<p>Our measure of requiring intubation is their P/F ratio now, (their arterial oxygen levels decided by the amount of oxygen they are on as a percentage) as well as their work of breathing. Anything below 200 we consider intubation. We also prone patients immediately as your lungs are bigger in the back than the front, so we can recruit more lung tissue. 12 hours proned, 12 hours supine. </p>
<p>Medicine hasn't changed a whole lot. We tried hydroxycholroquine, and gave it a good shot actually. It didn't make a difference. Again, once you're intubated it's too late for a miracle drug. Remdesivir also really didn't do shit. Antibody treatment did work quite well though, along with plasma therapy for managing symptoms. </p>
<p>The <em>biggest</em> driving force of fatalities though was staffing. During the "TikTok twerking" phase. Hospitalized laid off a shit ton of ancillary staff and everyone was stretched thin. But when you physically do not have time to respond to all your patient needs; adjusting vent settings, suctioning their ET tube, turning to prevent bed sores, giving life saving medications. People just die, en mass. That is what happened in New York. Cheap ass hospitals ran on a bare minimum staffing load and pocketed COVID money.</p>

        <p>I think the part about it being reckless is unsubstantiated mate. </p>
<p>There’s no evidence to say that was the cause. There is evidence to say that it was deliberately released on the world to further china and America’s global dominance. But it wasn’t them being reckless for sure. Things like this aren’t accidents and the global overreaction indicates the same. </p>
<p>Funny how Fauci said many years back that he’d love a pandemic, and then the lab that he’s finding and working with conveniently releases one on the world (that’s if you can call this a pandemic and not just dodgy governments fiddling the death statistics with their bullshit fake tests)</p>

        <p>Well it implies that China diberately released the virus and is in some way responsible for the entire outbreak. This is still speculation and probably will never be fully known.</p>
<p>Firstly remember when Wuhan locked down hard and all other provinces on China seemed to just carry on as normal, yet the rest of the world started declaring cases. Is it not strange that the virus was seemingly contained in one Chinese province but escaped and spread into most of world.</p>
<p>The thing is, the information is not there. It never will be. The smoking guns are surfacing, lately in the form of the 20 year old US patents that Dr David Martin has shown to demonstrate that the virus was not novel in any way. But after writing eloquently about not feeling bad about taking the jab, which I admired, my assessment was that the line about China was uneccessary and spoiled the sentiment by plugging an opinion which was presented without implying that it was just an opinion.</p>

        <p>If China didn't put on a show, which we've seen extra angles and other proofs to show pics were staged, then the whole world would be blaming China instead of mainly us theorist. They've been reopened longer than any place that shut down. China wants to be global superpower over US, tell me that this wasn't extremely convenient for them.</p>

        <p>It was convenient. But the global powers are all pissing in the same pot. Nothing happens just because China wants it to happen. If there is a shift in control from west to east, then that is a result of the global power structure, which China is still subservient to.</p>
