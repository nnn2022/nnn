    <strong>We need to be willing to make sacrifices going forward</strong>
    <p><p>I can't begin to tell you how many people who are anti-lockdowns and generally don't want to take the vaccine have stated that "if they mandate it for travel then I guess I'll take it". This is so utterly pathetic, it's even worse than the people who believe in the vaccine passport and mandating it, at least they're being honest about the life they want to live and are willing to back it up.</p>
<p>If you care about freedom, liberty, bodily autonomy, the future of your children, independent thought, and every freedom you had before this dystopian nightmare....FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STAND FOR IT! I am willing to sacrifice future travel, I am willing to sacrifice going to restaurants and theatres, I am willing to homeschool, heck, I'll live on the street with my family before I bow down and get injected by something against my will so that I can "get back" the freedoms they stole from me.</p>
<p>WAKE UP! We have power in numbers, if we all stand and fight this and are willing to sacrifice some things, we will win! They're counting on people to cower and just give in so that's why they're threatening us with this garbage, and it's working.</p>
<p>I'll end this rant with a quote:</p>
<p><strong>"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees"</strong></p>
<p>- <em>Emiliano Zapata</em></p></p>

We consumers have all the choices.</p>
<p>I even just bought a new car with my own demands.
The first store didn't want me on the property without a mask even.
"No problem".
I walked a cross the road and bought a new Audi, with a old school handshake after the deal. That felt good.</p>

        <p>They can. They probably will try. That's why people may think about values outside the bank.
Cash (for now). Precious metals. </p>
<p>But yes, they probably want to turn to CCP system here too. And to Communism.
It's so weird Western leaders want communism, but that's where we're going to end up with the "great" reset and universal salaries.</p>

<p>This is how they're going to coerce alot of people into taking it... Remember... It's not mandatory.... Nobody is forcing you...</p>
<p>My brother was trying to get me to commit to going on an all inclusive down south trip next year, and I told him I would go if they don't do vaccine passports, to which he replied "then just get the vaccine"</p>
<p>No. Is all I said.</p>
<p>I won't do it just because I want to travel. If they make it mandatory to fly between provinces (I live in Canada) then I guess I'll have to take more time off work and drive to visit my family. If they literally have checkpoints at the borders then I guess I'm stuck here. It sucks, but that's the sacrifice I'm willing to make.</p>
<p>In other news, my wife just found out she's pregnant 😁... Luckily, she's as based as I am and she's not going to get that shit injected into her either... But I'm kind of nervous in case vaccines are mandatory to enter the hospital. We talked about it last night and if she has to give birth without me, that's the sacrifice we have to make. And if that's the case, they're going to have to take me to jail... Because I will not leave her side willingly.</p>
<p>You're right OP.. sacrifices must be made.</p>

        <p>I just gave birth and while I get what you’re saying saying, you’re risking a lot by completely cutting out the possibility of hospitals. </p>
<p>I wanted to give birth at a birth center because I didn’t want to get tested for COVID. 20 hours into labor and my baby’s heart rate dropped and we discovered her cord was wrapped around her neck. I had to transfer to the hospital- she would have died without a c section. I’m young, healthy, had 0 complications in my pregnancy and this still happened to me. </p>
<p>I ended up testing positive for COVID and the hospital forced my husband to leave after the delivery. Worst thing I’ve ever been through but I would rather have had to deal with that then lose my child. Home births and birth centers are awesome and I am happy I tried to go that route but emergencies happen during childbirth all the time.</p>

<p>I hope for the best brother, we can stop this if we all stand strong. But even if; worst case scenario, this becomes the new normal then I guess I won't ever travel or do anything again, I'll count all the dollars I save from not participating in society or joining the herd being led to the slaughter.</p>

        <p>People do fight, and they get arrested for it. This isn’t a game gang. We are being ruled.</p>
<p>The only way to resist this is to unite, jump in and stand up for each other. But the problem is we all just want to mind our own business—it’s very easy to conquer a people who just want to be left alone.</p>

        <p>I’ve been thinking about this same thing. I keep telling everyone I will not get the vaccine unless I am somehow physically forced (who knows, the way things are going!). We shouldn’t even have to consider this issue, but I guess it’s what it’s coming down to.</p>

        <p>Ha, it may have to come to that because there's no way I'm rolling up my sleeve for that untested sludge just to escape the island. There will be ways and means I'm sure, the support for the ~~vaccine~~ experimental gene therapy is nowhere near as high as social media would suggest. There will be people dedicated to circumventing the worst of the measures I'm sure.</p>

        <p>Where is this silent majority though?  Probably out there waiting for the silent majority to finally wake up.  For that matter, what is “too far”?  In the past year, we’ve been forced to stay in our homes, wear a mask, stand six feet apart, shut down our businesses, and if you refuse to follow these rules, you risk public shaming in the form of some Karen causing a scene and blasting your face all over her Instagram, or you even face arrest.  Things that just a couple of years ago would’ve been dismissed as something out of North Korea, not the western world. They (whoever “they” are) went too far a long time ago.</p>
<p>Stop waiting on others to stand up for you.  Stand up for yourself.</p>

        <p>I've resigned myself to never leaving my state again. As an ESL teacher, this means my professional life is over. That's okay. I've started a little cottage-industry camera-repair business, and if it fails, it fails. I have no desire to reintegrate with an asylum. None. They won. It's okay. Sometimes, the bad guys win. Maybe always. Fuck 'em.</p>

<p>I think the least-worst place to be in canada right now is Alberta. Unfortunately i’m in curfew land so that’s probably the worst place to be right now on the whole north American continent.</p>

<p>They’ll keep taking our rights away. Within 3-5 years , if you don’t have a passport you’ll be living in the woods either alone or with a small community. You’ll be seen as filth and human garbage by the masses. </p>
<p>I’m expecting it and I accept it. The only question I have is who is coming with me? I wonder if my partner will. She had never taken a vaccine. She’s a naturalist. But can she withstand the torment coming? As I said we all have our breaking point. </p>

        <p>I'm mixed English/Brazilian but mostly ethnically English and living in the UK. My parents are talking about fleeing back to Brazil if they try to make the vaccine mandatory here but now courts in Brazil are trying to make it mandatory there.
