        <p>Not that I support vandalism/destruction of property, but businesses and governments have taken the wrong approach regarding mask mandates. They’re advertising “alternate” arrangements for the people who don’t want to wear masks, when in reality, these alternate arrangements should be for the people to afraid to be out in public where people aren’t wearing masks (people being normal).</p>

        <p>I’m only in the minority on reddit. Most people don’t care anymore and according to quite a few doctors, a lot in the medical profession disagree with the current approach but won’t speak out due to ostracism.</p>
<p>I’ve never shouted at a store worker, nor would I, and I don’t support violence. However, when you force others to adjust their life over something that has less than a 0.3% chance of killing them (much much less if you’re under 40) then you can’t not expect pushback. Did you really think you could dictate how others live and get away with it? If so... why? There have been great and terrible plagues in human history and we have never done this because it’s so frustratingly stupid.</p>

        <p>First off, past pandemics wreaked havoc across the world due to a lack of response and technology to combat them. And i can tell you didn't research any of this because if you even glanced at how countries tried to combat the 1918 flu then what you would see is that they had quarantines, homemade facemasks, isolation, and limitations on public gatherings.  Even 100 years ago people knew how to try to counter a pandemic.</p>
<p>About your first point, idk where you live or who you  talk to because it seems like you're in an echo chamber. Any anti mask protests I've seen have been pitifully small. But I'm not basing my view on anecdotal evidence.</p>
<p>I'm also going to need sources on your 'a lot of doctors' figure because anyone who is educated in science or medicine should be able to see that the data supports masks as a method of reducing spread.</p>

        <p>Ok, first off, as a history student, you’re in my realm when we’re talking about past pandemics. The 1918 flu was 17X worse than covid in terms of deaths, and likely more when you consider the lower population at that time. Oh, and it also killed young and healthy people, and masks were shown to be ineffective according to studies a year later, I’ll try and track down that study. Lastly, they did not quarantine healthy people and they didn’t limit public gatherings like you think (the Red Sox won the World Series). They knew that locking down the whole population was stupid. </p>

        <p>Alright, if i should defer to you as a history student about past pandemics, I, as a microbiology and biochem student submit to you that wearing masks has been proven to reduce respiratory droplets which carry the Covid 19 virus. Masks are not a perfect solution, and ideally they will be used alongside other measures such as social distancing. But they work. </p>
<p>Furthermore you said that people didn't respond with measures like masks and in the past to pandemics, which is why i mentioned the 1918 response. I didnt comment on the efficacy of such measures. But even in 1918 the experts reccomended very similar measures to social distancing to help the pandemic regardless of whether governments responded. </p>
<p>Again, all of you anti maskers seem to forget that the masks are to protect others from you primarily, not the other way around, although they do provide some protection to the wearer. </p>
<p>As for your links, i noticed that nothing in the Barrington Declaration decried mask wearing, and rather than claiming that lockdown doesn't  work, are concerned about the wider effects of the response on medical communities. I am also dubious about their comments on herd immunity, as research on covid immunity is not complete, but seems to indicate that immunity from contracting the virus is short term at best.</p>
<p>If we are to reduce lockdown measures, which I agree were only supposed to be temporary, social distancing and mask wearing are going to be important in reducing the spread before a vaccine is avaliable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the london  protest doesn't mean anti maskers are in a majority. Anywhere that has mask requirements sees a majority compliance with them.</p>

        <p>I don’t care about masks, not sure why you’re making this the focus. I can choose not to wear a mask if I disagree despite a mandate, as can somebody else. However, when people cannot go to work or just have the right to literally live their lives, that’s the big problem.</p>

        <p>It's exactly like you pointed out earlier. They are afraid to adjust their life. They think wearing a mask is an unreasonable adjustment, but going to a grocery store and risking death due to a deadly infection is somehow more reasonable. They have chosen to ignore evidence they disagree with. Sheer stupidity</p>

<p>I didn’t say <em>all</em> signatories.</p>

<p>This wouldn’t be defamtion, because it’s an opinion:</p>
<ul>
<li>dr disndhfksjsbdhwkwjrksksbdjdjejxjejakfjrjdjfjejrjfjfnrjjdkskdnwjdjr probably touches himself inappropriately in zoom meetings. </li>

        <p>We see the “reality” differently. You’re more concerned over covid, I’m upset about how people who weren’t going to die now have died due to lockdowns. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/0alWZmWk054">MP Desmond Swayne’s address to parliament over the mishandling of this entire situation</a></p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/mcm8Sc8f66o">Tom Woods on covid. He is a bit inflammatory but argues the point well</a></p>

        <p>Preserve our economies??! Lol, that’s a joke, right? The best thing for the economy is to open up right now before more people die from lockdown. You don’t realise how so many people are suffering from this. Socialisation is not optional... it’s essential to human life. Some of us actually want to live and not just exist, because you don’t know when you might die... and probably not even from covid (covid only accounted for 1.4% of U.K. total deaths this year)</p>

Ever think that even if you get over it and 'live' that you're not going to sustain permanent damage to your organs. What percentage have that? Living through it makes you weaker and will shorten your life and quality of life. Just fucking wear a mask. Smh</p>

        <p>I don't appreciate the condescension, and it does little to convert people to your side, not that you're going to but still. The CDC had a similar statement earlier this year, except they state that masks don't work, so not quite reliable. Again, like I've said to other people, I care more about lockdowns since wearing a mask is a personal choice, but lockdowns directly kill people.</p>

        <p>I'm am reporting your comment for being extremely rude and uncivil. How do you expect to have a conversation when you treat other people who disagree with you like this? I got covid early this year, it wasn't so bad for me. What is bad is not knowing if I can start grad school in person next fall. What is even worse is how many people are losing their livelihoods because of this. 130 million forced into poverty is a staggering number, so yeah, guess I'm a terrible person for not wanting them to starve.</p>

<p>Without mitigation, the disease is going to sweep through elder care facilities. In Sweden it wiped out 7% of the nursing home populations before they improved contact tracing and mitigation methods.</p>

        <p><a href="https://ltccovid.org/2020/07/23/new-country-report-the-covid-19-long-term-care-situation-in-sweden/">Your numbers do not seem to be correct.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Sweden-OECD-EC-Good-Time-in-Old-Age.pdf">Sweden's spending on health care is quite high compared to the rest of the world</a>. And it has the highest number of health care workers per 1,000. They were imminently prepared for CoVID and yet failed to protect vulnerable populations, likely because they had densely overcrowded care facilities. In other words, if the Swedes weren't prepared, neither is the rest of the world. </p>
<p>The great barrington declaration calls for mitigation techniques for the elderly and to let the disease take its course among the least vulnerable. The problem is that no country is even remotely prepared to protect vulnerable populations because they all have poorly managed elder care facilities. Even well developed health care systems like Italy completely dropped the ball.</p>
<p>A case fatality rate of almost 1% among those without preexisting conditions means the GBD's recommendations could mean deaths as high as 1% of the population even if they were able to prevent care facilities from becoming infection clusters.</p>
<p>Are you that sure about their data to call for letting CoVID spread out of control without mask mandates?</p>

        <p>The vaccine was announced a couple days ago. Even Fauci says it will be widely distributed early next year. You’re the ignorant one. Either ignorant or wilfully malicious, because so many people are either dying or forced into extreme poverty because of the lockdowns, and you don’t care. So either you’re ignorant, or you don’t give a fuck about them. Which is it? Pick one.</p>

        <p>The vaccine is in testing. You cannot go out and get it, hence it’s not “out”. When you say “hey that new movie is out, let’s go see it” it implies it is released and readily available for consumption. You’re dumb as shit and I sincerely hope you don’t get covid and spread it to older loved ones.</p>

        <p>Except the data doesn’t support this. Mask mandates have no correlation with decreased cases, and countries without mask mandates (Norway, Sweden, Belarus, and Denmark) do just as well as other places, and better than a lot. </p>
<p>This is because droplets only matter if you sneeze or cough. Cover your mouth when you cough, it’s not hard.</p>

        <p>Those countries you listed, they may not have mandated masks, but they are among the earliest countries to lock down, something else that you oppose as a pandemic response. I think that wearing a mask is less distuptive than lockdown though tbh. Bottom line, having a decisive response is what actually correlates to good pandemic control.</p>
<p>I'm afraid breathing does in fact mean that you are exhaling respiratory droplets, it's not at all just from coughing or sneezing.</p>

        <p>Except I’ve already shown that lockdowns don’t have any effect. Meanwhile, lockdowns cause things like 400,000 more to die from TB this year and a plethora of other horrible effects. Sorry, I’m done debating this. I don’t support crimes against humanity, simple at that.</p>

        <p>People are defending this guy? Just wear a fucking mask you absolute children. It doesn’t completely eliminate the risk of getting covid, but it <em>decreases</em> it. Even if it’s only a small difference, <em>its still a difference.</em> My dad is upper 60s and has diabetes, if he were to catch it he would literally die. This isn’t some petty request from the government to make your lives miserable, it’s literally life and death. Maybe not for you, but for some people, like my father, it certainly is.

        <p>“review of the literature offers evidence in favor of widespread mask use to reduce community transmission: non- medical masks use materials that obstruct droplets of the nec- essary size; people are most infectious in the initial period post-infection, where it is common to have few or no symp- toms (10–16); non-medical masks have been effective in reduc- ing transmission of influenza; non-medical masks have been shown to be effective in small trials at blocking transmission of coronavirus; and places and time periods where mask us- age is required or widespread have shown substantially lower community transmission.
The available evidence suggests that near-universal adop- tion of non-medical masks when out in public, in combination with complementary public health measures could successfully reduce effective-R to below 1.0, thereby stopping community spread. Economic analysis suggests that the impact of mask wearing could be thousands of US dollars saved per person per mask “</p>

        <p>If masks worked, we would see a decrease in cases and deaths two weeks after mask mandates went into effect. We have not seen this in so many different countries. The graphs for countries with mask mandates and without look exactly the same. So no, it is in fact you who has no evidence.</p>

        <p>This is not true, and Japan did not lock down, it’s against their constitution. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Belarus, and Iceland. All countries without mandates and Sweden and Belarus had no lockdown. None of these countries are in the top ten covid deaths per capita. Your argument is disproven.</p>

You can’t argue against his data, which is all from mainstream and reliable sources, so you resort to ad hominem. That’s low. You have no legs left to stand on, so I’d just pack it in if I were you.

        <p>I am not saying he doesn’t have a valuable voice. I am saying he allows his personal beliefs to influence his stance on the issue way too much. It invalidates his points. His reading of the European data is flawed. Where he saying you should see the drop isn’t where he thinks it should be to prove his point. Another reading of it is people wearing masks and following rules. Seeing the dips in spread and then becoming lax with the protocols. And then spikes happen. Masks work. Next time you have a surgery tell the doctors and nurses not to wear masks. They don’t wear masks to protect themselves from your insides. That is basic 19th century science friend. Cases are spiking in non mask wearing areas like Midwest and the south.</p>

        <p>Cases are spiking <em>months</em> after the lockdowns lifted in those areas. I don’t think this conversation will be beneficial anymore, because you’re grasping at straws now, especially since you claim that the mask data is wrong (without any compelling reason) and then conclude that masks work???

        <p>I disagree.  When a private business chooses to enforce a state order requiring facial coverings, they are contributing to the validation of the mainstream narrative.  Once private businesses no longer require masks, the sooner we can be free of them, as it will not be able to be enforced, and thus people will be able to think for themselves.  This gives a person the choice to make their own decisions and I guarantee you that they will decide to be rid of the mask.</p>

        <p>Many private businesses wouldn't require people to wear masks if the government didn't fine and close them down. If you're pro-private business then you should be okay with a business not requiring masks.</p>

        <p>I am.  I’m 100% not in favor of government mandate, but i support businesses making the choice, even though I’d vote with my dollar and go elsewhere.  But taking it out on a business, irrespective of if its due to mandate or policy is unproductive.  Using a means test as justification for stupid actions is even less productive.</p>
