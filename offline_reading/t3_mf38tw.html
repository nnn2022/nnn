    <strong>Here Come the Global Vaccine Passports</strong>
    <p><p>(Since reddit has a sitewide bad on posting articles from Zero Hedge (WTF?), I replicated the text here)</p>
<p>Vaccination passports are being called the new "golden ticket" needed  for global travel - and the hospitality industries that benefit - now  that the recovery is on its way.</p>
<p>Countries like Greece, who get a  sizeable share of their country's GDP from tourism, are looking forward  to welcoming back visitors. Greece will re-open itself to visitors on  May 14, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-25/covid-vaccine-passports-2021-the-golden-ticket-for-international-travel?srnd=premium">Bloomberg</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-25/covid-vaccine-passports-2021-the-golden-ticket-for-international-travel?srnd=premium">noted</a>  last week, but will require either a vaccination, proof of recovery  from the virus of a negative test before departing for the country. </p>
<p>Those  who require tourism for their livelihoods are ready to move on. Rental  boat operator Panagiotis Mastoras said: “It’s the safest way. We’ve  reached a point where it can’t go on like this.”</p>
<p>Greece is leading  the way in pushing for vaccine passports - usually taking the form  of certificates or digital cards - an idea that is also catching on in  tourist nations like Thailand and the Caribbean. For businesses who rely  on tourism, the "passport" is seen as a "route to salvation", the  report notes.</p>
<p>Air travel could win up losing $95 billion in 2021 after 2020's worst  year on record. As a result, airlines are following suit in supporting  ideas that can get people traveling again. </p>
<p>“We’re pinning our  hopes on the vaccines and the Covid pass,” hotel manager Jorge Marichal,  who operates in the Canary Islands, said.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Goh, who heads  the Star Alliance of 26 carriers including Air China, Deutsche  Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, and United Airlines Holdings, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-25/covid-vaccine-passports-2021-the-golden-ticket-for-international-travel?srnd=premium">told</a>  Bloomberg: “There has been a lot of advocacy, but the execution has  been sorely lacking.” He believes a single set of standards needs to be  developed for most major carriers and countries.</p>
<p>Singapore  Airlines and Qatar Airlines have both started trials of passport apps,  while Carnival Cruiselines has said no one can board its ships without  proof of vaccination. American Airlines has started experimenting with  the VeriFly app (as has Hyatt Hotels) and United has developed its own  app that allows passengers to upload their vaccination records. </p>
<p>In  the EU, on March 17, a "Digital Green Certificate" was given the green  light. It could take up to 3 months before it is implemented and can be  used. </p>
<p>But the devil is in the details. Aside from the obvious critique of  globalization and overreaching government and corporations getting their  noses in your medical records, the vast array of vaccines - some of  which have been approved in limited amounts of counties - could make it  tricky to determine who is "safe" to travel and who isn't. The passports  are also simply unfair, as they "would inevitably favor the inhabitants  of richer nations over poorer ones where the distribution of shots has  barely begun," the report notes.</p>
<p>Bill Barnett, founder of  hospitality consultants C9 Hotelworks Co., thinks the damage is  psychological, more than anything: “It’s a case of needing to win over  hearts and minds. There’s still a fear factor out there.”</p>
<p>And the  Virginia-based Global Business Travel Association, which oversees more  than $345 billion, has simply said that the White House should resist <em>any</em> moves that further cripple air travel.</p></p>

        <p>Well- our limitlessly benevolent and compassionate government in the US will be ever so kind enough to gently spoon feed the concept to us- undoubtedly using our friends in the apolitical, truthful. and unbiased media to do the equivalent of making airplane noises as the bureaucracy graciously and considerately shoves them all the way down our throat.</p>

        <p>Oh chill. For as long as they're not prepared to rewrite the entire EU charter this shit will never fly in the long term. There's no legal way they can ban an EU citizen from entering any EU country, and that isn't conditional, so there's that. All they can do is to close borders temporarily, but then it applies to all incoming people from specific location</p>

        <p>Laughable.</p>
<p>I remember when people, like you, laughed and insulted me when I said this wouldn't only last two weeks. "That shit will never fly" some idiot told me. Hell, people said lockdowns outside of China wouldn't even happen at all.</p>
<p>After everything that happened in the last year, I don't get why people who frequent this sub deny any of this being possible.</p>

        <p>To get past bans...use archive.is or paste the url into a base64 encoder, make sure you specify that the gobbledygook you paste is in base 64 and we can use that encoder encoder decode and visit the site.</p>

        <p>Not 100% sure about <a href="https://archive.is">archive.is</a>, but that is more because it won't actually stream the video, but base64 does work.</p>
