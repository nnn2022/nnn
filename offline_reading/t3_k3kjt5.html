    <strong>A thought I had that might cheer you up</strong>
    <p><p>Over the past nine months, I’ve gone from being very cautious about Covid to attending two anti-lockdown protests since October. While many will say they smelled the corrupt ulterior motives from day one, I am not alone in having to take a bit more time to reach the conclusions I have. </p>
<p>The cause for optimism is that nobody is taking this journey in reverse. Nobody started out with the view that this was a scam in March and has now changed their mind and began wearing a hazmat suit to the supermarket. The pendulum of public opinion is only swinging in one direction and as we all know, this ends when people stop complying.</p>
<p>At the protest in London there was a group of young fellas in Hyde Park who saw the march, approached me to ask what it was all about, then joined in! Now he knows he’s not alone and knows that there’s another side to this story. He can’t have been the only one. </p>
<p>They can try to slow it down with lies, censorship and shaming, but they cannot stop it. Soon there will be more of us than there are of them. Soon the police will give up enforcing these idiotic restrictions as it isn’t worth the resources. Nobody is moving the other way and we are within sight of victory.</p></p>

        <p>I make sure to tell as many stranger as possible that they don’t have to wear the mask. I get 3-7 each time I go out to remove their masks. </p>
<p>“You don’t have to wear that if you don’t want to sir/ma’am.”  </p>
<p>Works very well. And never argue with em unless they insult you. Then have fun.</p>

        <p>This is definitely a good indicator, BUT it might also signal to the people in charge that they have to become even more draconian in their enforcement, and sites like this one even more draconian in their censorship. Unfortunately the media and tech sector are not on our side.</p>
<p>And this is to say nothing of 'false flags' if the fearmongers get really desperate (eg deploying a respiratory bioweapon somewhere to manufacture fear). There are a lot of fence-sitters or casual skeptics who would immediately go all-in on pro-lockdown attitudes if something like that happened :(</p>

        <p>They can try. This is why I’m such a fan of protest marches. They do not have the resources to arrest everyone and the world is more sensitive to abuses of power by the police than ever before. On Saturday, the police were ready at Kings Cross, so everyone just went to Marble Arch. All they could really do is try and chase thousands of people around London and ask them to go home. There were tens of thousands there and the police made 60 arrests.  I’d love to know what the mood was in the station after that paltry return!</p>

        <p>I remember in late March I went to the grocery store with an old n95 from woodworking and latex gloves on like it was the fucking plague. Then I caught it a week later and got over it in a week. I think the strain has weakened significantly since then, many more asymptomatics out there than before.</p>

        <p>It’s also pretty clear that there is fairly wide cross-immunity from other cornavirii.</p>
<p>It’s not 100%, but it’s definitely not 0% either.</p>

        <p>Obviously cross-immunity exists. Otherwise we'd all die from a new (nOVeL!!!) flu strain like the pre-Columbian natives. Don't need a degree to postulate that.</p>

        <p>Sure, but the point is that many of the most doom and gloom predictions have been based on a baseline of 0%, and assume that we’ve only gained ~20-40%.</p>
<p>The reality is that we were already at ~30-50% when this started, which puts us damned close to effective herd immunity at this point.</p>
<p>Most of what we’re seeing at this point are the product of a mix of bad data (i.e. massively expanding the use of tests with relatively high false positive rates) and the virus mutating and those mutations spreading.</p>
<p>Without the media blitz, most people would have assumed a slightly worse than normal flu season, and we wouldn’t be worried about it anymore.</p>

        <p>I largely agree with you - but my good friend recently got ill (not covid) and now he's gone very "doomer". He is staying home, not going to work, only allowing myself and a few others in his home, until he gets a vaccine. (I think his doctor terrified him.)</p>
<p>However, he is still opposed to lockdowns and is still very libertarian.</p>

        <p>I moved the other direction:  believing it was nothing and now I'm terrified. I started out assuming it was just globalists taking more power for themselves and laughing at us, but now that the hospitals are getting overrun the virus seems a bit more real.</p>

        <p>I'd suggest if you want to get over this, actually go and look at one of these so called 'overrun' hospitals.  Stand outside, watch how many people / ambulances are coming and going, go inside to reception if you can. Most certainly what you will find is a normal hospital. If you can provide me actual proof of any hospital being overrun solely due to covid outside of 2 hospitals in Italy (which also had many other reasons for why that happened), I'd genuinely be interested to see it, and I don't mean just some garbage made up stats, but actual 'people dying in hallways or being treated in tents', you know, like what happened during the 2018 flu season, when I also assume you were terrified.</p>

        <p>I understand that people who are scared of the virus come off as weenies, but there's still no reason to respond with such contempt to an innocuous statement. Unless you don't care about changing people's behaviors, which is fair, I certainly don't.</p>
<p>That aside, it's a good idea but I don't think it would address my fear. My state isn't doing as poorly as other states so my fear wouldn't likely accept what I'm observing. </p>
