        <p>Talc and asbestos are found in the same geologic formations. Both are natural. You cannot have one without the other.</p>
<p>That is the reason why the settlement in this case is moronic. J&amp;J should have pushed harder and pointed out the above saying "Hey: We did our level best to filter out the asbestos but there is no way known to anyone right now to get all the asbestos out of talc!"</p>

        <p>Then they should have put a label on their products saying," may contain asbestos."</p>
<p>Also what you said is not true. </p>
<p>Cosmetic grade Talc doesnt contain Asbestos, but Industrial grade does. J and J  knew their talc contained Asbestos and lied about it, and hid that information from the public. Thats the problem</p>
<p>---They willingly deceived the public about the risks associated with using their public, for monetary gain, and it cost people their lives, and pain, and suffering. </p>
<p>Hmm..... That seems to be an ongoing theme with these companies....</p>

        <p>You are wrong I spent months on case studies for this with a large law firm. Yes asbestos and talc are found right next to each other in nature.  J&amp;J KNEW they had tainted talc w asbestos from a whistleblower scientist way back in the 70’s. They not only lied about it but covered it up and tried intimidating witnesses. They were told by lawyers they needed to included a warning label saying that the baby powder may contain deadly cancer causing asbestos and they didn’t. If you look at a dollar store brand of baby powder they contain this message. What they did is criminal. And now after pulling asbestos containing baby powered off US shelves they have started a campaign targeting Indian and Mexican women with the same deadly powder. FUCK JOHNSON AND JOHNSON</p>
