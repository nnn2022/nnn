    <strong>Vax wait and see.</strong>
    <p><p>When the drive to get the jab all started I wasn’t terribly interested. I’m in good health I’m 35 so well out of the danger zone for this disease.  I’d never have described myself as antivax but anyone can see these products have been rushed so a wait and see approach seemed like really the only reasonable approach available.  </p>
<p>I think the very best proof of this being the right strategy is AstraZeneca. With Europe’s Version of the CDC now admitting that the vaccine would cause twice as many deaths in the 18-39 age range as COVId itself even with its inflated numbers!?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sgtreport.com/2021/07/euro-study-clot-risk-to-18-39s-from-astrazeneca-vaccine-is-twice-as-high-as-covid-death-risk/">European CDC findings</a></p>
<p>How can people possibly still think we should be rushing in to get vaccinated!?  How can they possibly still be blaming those of us who haven’t been vaxxed for surges in cases when their ‘medicine’ is actually disproportionately killing the youth!?</p>
<p>It’s not like this information was available when AstraZeneca was released. This was trial and error on the sheep who signed up and the error killed a lot of young otherwise healthy people. </p>
<p>And now that we know?  They’re still pushing this garbage harder than ever!</p>
<p>In a nutshell I’ve gone from “vaccine hesitant” to “will never trust a single thing my government or the media try to tell me ever again”</p>
<p>/end rant</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me vent.</p></p>

        <p>As I have pointed out to the militant everybody-vaxxers:  </p>
<p>1) my concern is about long term effects and unknown risks.</p>
<p>2) 6 months ago, this vaccine was "completely safe".  So when we had the discussions with this people back then, we were called whack jobs.</p>
<p>3) now we know that the vaccines can cause Myocarditis, blood clots and guillain-barre among a bunch of other fun things.  But we are still being called whack jobs.  </p>
<p>4) what will we discover in the next 6 months?</p>

<p>While <em>we</em> know it now, <em>they</em> knew it back in 2020 (FDA has a slide on this from 2020).</p>

        <p>We're also discovering that the vaccine not only doesn't stop the virus from spreading it may actually someone be increasing the spread.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/holmenkollin/status/1415989536933490688</p>
<p>So much has been odd about this but as soon as the type of people that push hard to promote bullshit wars started pushing hard to promote lockdowns and the vax I knew something was up.</p>

        <p>Well, it kind of makes sense.  High vaccination rates will cause the herd to be uniformly immune to a single variant and certain related variants.  So what mutation will proliferate? The one that does not get thwarted by the vaccine.   It's almost like the virologists didn't think about step #2.</p>
