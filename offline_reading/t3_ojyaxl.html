    <strong>Should I make anything of this?</strong>
    <p><p>I am working on an email to send to local government officials and the local councils to be aware of the concerns of the public and to help push back against mandatory vaccination.</p>
<p>I saw some fact sheets about pfizer and floated across something similar for Ausrtalia. The two paragraphs are from two different documents. This looks like inconsistent information to me, but I don't want to rashly jump to conclusions.</p>
<p>One says it acts like a standard vaccine, the other says it mutates cells. I also don't know how true it is that the "genetic code is then broken down by the body" as autopsies have shown the spike protein leaking from the injection site and infecting every major organ in the body and which causes the bodies immune system to attack itself and not just prevent the virus. </p>

<p>Why am I being given COMIRNATY? </p>
<p>COMIRNATY contains the active ingredient BNT162b2 [mRNA]. COMIRNATY is an mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccine. COMIRNATY is a vaccine given to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus in adults and adolescents from 16 years of age and older. COMIRNATY works by triggering your immune system to produce antibodies and blood cells that work against the virus, to protect against COVID-19 disease.</p>

<p>About the vaccine </p>
<p>Comirnaty (Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd) is a vaccine that can prevent people from becoming ill from COVID-19. Comirnaty does not contain any live virus, and it cannot give you COVID-19. It contains the genetic code for an important part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus called the spike protein. After getting the vaccine, your body makes copies of the spike protein. Your immune system will then learn to recognise and fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The genetic code is then broken down quickly by the body.</p></p>
