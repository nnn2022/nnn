    <strong>What if, when shit hits the fan, the unvaxxed will be targeted by vaxxed, just out of spite?</strong>
    <p><p>Getting worried. Like seriously worried.
What if, when everything gets out and people realize they have been tricked, vaxxed take it out on non vaxxed, out of pure spite?
Your thoughts on this would be very appreciated</p></p>

        <p>No, my point is - in 2 years: side effects start coming up in huge numbers. People realize it was the vaccine. And get angry. At the unvaxxed, for not insisting with them, not making enough to stop them from taking it. “If I’m suffering, you should be as well, it’s not fair. We are all the same and should be on a leveled field” something like this?</p>

        <p>They will not realize anything until the very end... if ever.</p>
<p>If I'm right (and I really really hope I'm not) the vaccinated will start dying this winter. At first they will hide it, then, when it's not going to be possible to do so anymore (it will not just be elderly grandma that dies this time, people will know many other people that either are dead or have been very sick, at that point is kind of tricky to pretend nothing's happening) they will blame it on a "new aggressive variant". </p>
<p>Statistics showing that the new aggressive variant overwhelmingly affects the vaccinated will be downplayed or ignored altogehter. They will try to blame the unvaxxed, or really anything except the obvious - it's the vaccines doing it.</p>
<p>The only reason I can think of that can be behind the huge blitz for having as many vaccinated people as possible before the winter is that they very well know what's gonna happen next winter to the vaccinated. Otherwise, if this was something slow acting, why rush? They can repeat last year's script, even better, since there's "not enough people vaccinated" to reach herd immunity. So, lock everyone up, inject, claim not enough people yet had the shot, repeat.</p>
<p>People are eating literally anything up. They don't need for the narrative to make sense, they just need to push it aggressively on tv. It works, and they won. So <em>why the rush</em>?</p>
<p>The vaccinated will not realize a thing until they're made to. When the TV tells them to blame the unvaccinated, they will. They will never sit back and reflect on what's happened - they would have already if that was a possibility. We're 16 months into this web of lies and deception and no one seems to realize except a few. Nothing's gonna change when it comes to that.</p>

        <p>Such good points. What you said about them having to work on a limited time line is something I thought of too. They might be preparing for an undeniable moment where no amount of propaganda will cover the death up. At this point they might have the media just admit that there was "a problem" with the vaccine, cause if they don't they will lose even more credibility. Like you said, why else would there be such a hurry? And if Trump decides to run again, it'll be just in time to blame him for Operation Warp Speed. </p>
<p>That SPARS exercise that read like a play described it coming out and there being outrage over vaccine death. So this is something they are aware of, and planning for.</p>

        <p>Everything that's happening now as we speak is crazy. It's a nightmare scenario but yes it's very possible. The Authorities will always scapegoat the unvaxxed, and the majority of the vaccinated are led by fear and will eat up any easy answer the Authorities/MSM will throw at them.</p>

        <p>If there's something one should have learned over the last year is that in a time of crisis the unthinking majority will <em>always</em> look up to someone to tell them what to do. If MSM tells them it's our fault no amount of logical explanations (or, lack of consistency on the MSM side) will convince them otherwise.</p>

        <p>What if I told you in november 2019 the whole world would turn into a fascist hellhole over a virus with an IFR like this one.</p>
<p>Crazy right?</p>
<p>It has already happened, and nobody's doing shit about it. On the contrary - they're asking for more. </p>
<p>Can't find a link right now but I've read about those "exercises" from the military here and there over the last decade or so: first, they take out water and the power supply from the target city. Then, they sweep in and demand everyone to identify themselves with a provided ID card or such. Those who submit get water and food. Happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thinking about it now, sounds like a test run.</p>

        <p>The whole world economy is running on fumes. Supply chain disruptions are already happening and will only get worse.</p>
<p>Again, I keep repeating that in every comment I write, I really, really hope I'm wrong. If I'm not, this whole covid scam will be remembered with the same nostalgia we now remember the pre-2020 world.</p>
<p>Many people on /r collapse say the same, and I just can't help but get behind that sentiment: "worst case scenario, you've got 6 months worth of food, you can just eat it". I mean, that's not gonna hurt much financially. Think of the alternative - where there's no food and you have none.</p>
<p>For people that live far from the city and have a piece of land, there's some basics you should have secured by now: A water source, be it rainwater or a stream; seeds and farming equipment; and a generator plus some diesel fuel. Most folks that live there will have those already, but now it's a good time to make sure everything works and potentally to stock up on some extra supplies.</p>

        <p>Yeah if you got the Pfizer shot you have to vaccinate 119 people to save one grandma! If we wanted to protect just the people in America we would need to vaccinate 35 billion people. It’s so effective and the only drug that’s going to protect you from covid. Take it now or kill everyone you know and love it’s that simple.</p>

        <p>Does he? My doctor has told us quite clearly not to get this vaccine, and that he isn't allowed to tell anyone that. Medical practices are getting closed down over this shit, so some are playing along others are being open about it. </p>
<p>If you haven't spoken to your family doctor I suggest doing so, seems like the majority of people online spewing bullshit haven't actually spoken to a medical professional, all the ones I've talked to are against this but most have been forced into getting 1 jab to keep their doors open.</p>

<p>Well I'm sure no doctor has ever said anything untrue or incorrect, you're probably right to trust them blindly as a source for reliable info.. because they "seem alright". (/s)</p>
<p>Regarding the maniac comment, my doctors have always said I'm healthy in body and mind, should I trust them on this or no?</p>

        <p>That’s what I’m considering. I have never felt more connected with myself than after a year and a half at home. Never felt so much like myself. But as for the people around me.. losing many friends, afraid to bring the topic up with family (already some fights have happened).. I feel like I can’t be me. Because asking questions is very, very naughty and actually embarrassing for my family members. I think my boyfriend is also starting to get bothered with my “obsession” with this. For the very first time, I’m actually getting scared. Don’t know what to do anymore.</p>

I’m not sure what to make of the shedding thing either, I have enough I’m stressing on, so I try not to let it concern me.<br>
Hopefully you can hold off for awhile longer before taking it?  Many more reports of side effects are popping up along with deaths. Get as much info as you can for yourself, before giving in.  You can pm anytime if you want to chat.  Hang in there. 💜</p>

        <p>Right now vaxxed are targeting nonvaxxed for being "irresponsible". But I think what you are asking is will they lash out because of actual jealousy. That's a good point. Maybe some of them are scared and don't want to admit they are wrong. Maybe they are really  pissed because they envy people who didn't make a life altering rushed decision regarding their health. I think the one's who are infertile may get very resentful.</p>

        <p>Yes, that's exactly how it will play out. It's a standard scapegoat propaganda operation:</p>
<p>Create a minority. Do something terrible. Blame the minority for the terrible thing you did.</p>
<p>Americans have been conditioned for decades to blame "downward." Think about it. You hear people all the time, mad at "welfare people" rather than focusing on the creators of that system.</p>
<p>It is always this way. Blaming downward, never upward. That's why they are dehumanizing us in media, so that when time for blame comes it can be shifted onto us.</p>
<p>In the end, it will somehow be our fault that they took these shots which turn out to be harmful long-term.</p>
<p>This is all in the SPARS Pandemic Scenario:</p>

        <p>Ok look, what is your basis for that type of thinking? Real world or something from movies or cable television?
Perhaps its rooted in real life riots? Or perhaps its the war on Christianity that is destroying faith in others? There's good and there are evil. Always has been. But there was one ideal that changed the ways of many humans, it is based on equality and freedom of humankind. America's foundation is based on it. Hope you find your way soon.</p>

        <p>Well have you seen the news about Cuba and South Africa? Have you seen what angry people are willing to do? I couldn’t give 2 shits about America. What I fear is that the world is following these CDC and WHO blindly. Whoever disagrees gets suspended/banned. Doctors here say stupid shit all the time - this doesn’t really get me confident on taking the vax. I leave every debate (backed up with numbers and facts) with people I love that have taken the vaccine hearing “yes, I mean that’s in fact strange, but I don’t really care, I can’t save the world anyway”</p>

        <p>That's been the plan all along. Wait until the next couple cold/flu seasons. They'll be deathly sick in droves, we'll be fine, yet because of the inevitable fear and hysteria they'll believe it when they're told we are the reason why they're fucked up and not the concoction they had injected into their bodies.</p>

<p>I am optermistic that there is already an antidote.  Once these sick individuals have collected the data, then hopefully people will be given treatment to reverse symtoms. Probably at a cost.</p>
<p>Though I think it will be some years before the antidote is given to the people. So the vaccinated will realise that they need the unvaccinated to help 'clean ' their blood. Not much can be done about the blood brain barrier.</p>
