<title>FOIA requests reveal that no one has the actual virus in their possession. Even the RT-PCR s were put together without a sample of the virus. If they were never calibrated to a real virus, then what are they testing?</title>

        <p>FDA's admission that the rapid test is a failure:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/letters-health-care-providers/potential-false-positive-results-antigen-tests-rapid-detection-sars-cov-2-letter-clinical-laboratory</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>User Manual for the PRC test which warns that it can't be used to diagnose the cause of symptoms:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>(page 38)</p>
<p>Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.  •The performance of this test has not been established for monitoring treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.•The performance of this test has not been established for screening of blood or blood products for the presence of 2019-nCoV.•This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.</p>
<p>(page 39)</p>
<p><strong>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available,</strong> assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here are the symptoms of Covid taken from the CDC:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Fever or chills</p>
<p>Cough</p>
<p>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle or body aches</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>New loss of taste or smell</p>
<p>Congestion or runny nose</p>
<p>Nausea or vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>With the exception of the loss of taste and smell, those are the exact symptoms of influenza.  Both cause pneumonia which lead to long lasting lung damage.  The only difference is that influenza will attack far more young people than covid will. Covid mostly attacks the elderly which we all saw in March and April.  That was proven without any doubt.  Influenza kills children and young adults.  Covid kills the elderly.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And since no test can diagnose covid-19, how are you diagnosing it?  Surely you're not using the tests that don't work are you?  I mean... no hospital would be so irresponsible as to use a test that the FDA admits doesn't work.... right?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lock down didn't happen until April and people were STILL going shopping and many were still going to work- every day.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Most people are immune. Most don't even get sick. Most just fight it off without any trouble. Very few get sick and almost no one dies. Nursing homes make up about 1% of the population and account for 50% of the deaths. That's 50% from only 1% of the population. Those numbers match what the CDC has put out as the mortality rate:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here are the latest CDC numbers:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Covid-19</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 0-19 Survival Rate: 99.997 Mortality Rate: 0.003%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 20-49 Survival Rate: 99.98 Mortality Rate: 0.02%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So unless you're really old, you generally have nothing to fear from this. Even influenza has a higher mortality rate than this!</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Influenza 2018-2019</p>
<p>Age: 0-4 Survival Rate: 98.7% Mortality Rate: 1.3%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 5-17 Survival Rate: 99.6% Mortality Rate: 0.4%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 18-49 Survival Rate: 98.2% Mortality Rate: 1.8%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 50-64 Survival Rate: 91% Mortality Rate: 9%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Age: 65+ Survival Rate: 51.3% Mortality Rate 48.7%</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>And here is an article from the New York Times that states that 90% of all covid tests should have been negative.  That's 90%!!!!  So no one is dying of covid!</p>

        <p>Michael O Bernicia has been leading the charge to sue a whole bunch of people in the UK for fraud. Apparently they're is an authorization to arrest Matt Hancock, the Secretary of State for Health. It seems that would be like arresting Fauci for Fraud, which would be so satisfying. He did a great podcast interview that you can listen to on the Good Vibrations podcast from November 4th. Super inspiring to hear a real normal person doing something heroic. Anyways, the guy who submitted all of those FOIA requests asking for the virus was inspired by Bernicia's efforts. Jon Rappoport has similarly found an empty space where the virus was said to be, in the USA.</p>
