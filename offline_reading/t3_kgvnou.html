    <strong>Guys, I have some good news and some bad news</strong>
    <p><p>I finally mustered up the courage to go to the r/coronavirus sub and clicked on a few posts, checked the comments, etc.</p>
<p>The good news is, that sub is less and less of a downer, comments are starting to be a bit more rational and objective. Upvotes, too.</p>
<p>The bad news is, it appears that our sub is more doom and gloom at the moment than that dreadful community. Honestly, I hope we are wrong about all of this, and we're all back to normal in 5-6 months time. Otherwise, us being right suggests something is coming and it's a lot darker and depressing than this virus ever was.</p></p>

        <p>First of all, I went there yesterday, and I saw about the same amount of "downer comments" that there usually are. Just because there's a couple comments that go against their narrative, which are usually downvoted to oblivion anyway, doesn't mean they are more rational and objective there all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Second of all, I don't understand the people here who get upset and  confused by the "doom and gloom". More lockdowns and restrictions are happening all over the world, more articles coming out that even with the fabled vaccine we will never go back to normal, more fear from the masses, more incidents of maskless people being attacked and filmed, more politicians and celebrities being caught breaking the rules and getting away with it, and so on and so on and so on. It feels like gaslighting to act like people here are crazy for being depressed, anxious, worried, and angry over the current events happening. In fact, it feels very naive to say that things are getting better with all the stuff happening around us. </p>
<p>Finally, I am tired of people claiming that things are better now. People have been saying this for months, that the tides are turning or that life is basically normal. Where I'm at, it's not. In many other places, that is also not the case. Many users here do not feel like life is normal or things are changing for the better. </p>
<p>Also, if some of the government leaks are to be believed, the one from Canada and now one from France, it seems that matters could get worse in 2021 unless people finally fucking fight back, which most are still not doing anything.</p>

        <p>I wasn't claiming any of the things you said. I don't feel things are improving and I do not believe that all that's happening should be taken at face value. I am just hoping we are wrong for all our sakes.</p>
<p>Also, I am not upset about the doom and gloom, I've been a part of this sub and subs similar to it from DAY 1. I'm just saying that we should maybe look for hope that we'll get our old normal back (the normal, normal) and not focus solely on the negative.</p>

        <p>Man, Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum have said themselves that a cyber virus is coming, ok, could come, and Schmovid would look like a cakewalk. Even a day without the Internet would cost a 50B dollars to the world economies. They talk openly about it and make ad videos, come on now. Sure it'd be great to be wrong about everything we talk here, but facts say otherwise. Just take a look around, everything is out in the open as Alex Jones says, lol.</p>

        <p>I hope that we are locked down, with increasingly strict and nonsensical rules, until people actively revolt. </p>
<p>If the restrictions are <em>withdrawn</em> rather than <em>openly rejected</em>, we will have lockdowns, and generally more tyrannical governments, for the rest of our lives. </p>
<p>If you are just hopefully waiting for things to get back to normal ... <strong>you are the problem.</strong></p>
<p>You are identifying yourself as property rather than a person: your existence, your livelihood, even your ability to go for a run outside or see family are things that you accept as privileges to be granted or withheld at someone else’s whim. </p>
<p>You can be a person or property. You cannot be both. </p>
<p>You can <strong>actively, openly</strong> oppose the new - or you can accept it. You must choose.</p>

        <p>It seems doom and gloom because that is the reality we are living in. Look around you. Pay attention to what’s currently happening around the globe because globalists are publicly stating their agenda. </p>
<p>Europe is the testing grounds for their agenda so whatever happens there will eventually come to the US. There aren’t any leaders resisting and fighting for us so we have fend this off for ourselves. </p>
<p>The good news: we have strength in Numbers.</p>

        <p>I hope we are wrong too but I don't think we are. Yeah this sub gets pretty gloomy because that is the reality of the situation. Maybe after the vaccine is widely distributed things will start going back to normal, but the goalposts have been moved so many times that most here don't have their hopes up.</p>
