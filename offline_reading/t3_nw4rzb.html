    <strong>A big change just happened in my life...</strong>
    <p><p>TLDR: I had to leave my job today because of an ultimatum regarding the vaccine and covid polices, that resulted in an anxiety attack and a psychological breakdown. </p>
<p>Hello everyone of this sub, you beautiful like minded bastards. </p>
<p>I post today looking for support and any advice that may be able to be offered, regarding a change in my life as of this morning. </p>
<p>I was working at a small company of about six people, and I was the only not vaxxed, which means i was the only one wearing masks. This, over the course of the past month and a half led up to an anxiety attack, and a psychological breakdown yesterday. </p>
<p>The anxiety attack happened at work, and my boss asked about what was going on. I explained that it was the covid stuff messing with head ( wed already had this conversation multiple times ), and it was causing the anxiety attack. </p>
<p>Well essentially he told me that I was bringing down the morale of the team because I couldn't move past these policies that were in place. Me wearing the mask, and being the only one getting tested weekly. He then gave an ultimatum of " letting go of the thoughts and emotions regarding the policy, to preserve morale, or we could part ways." I ended up going home the rest of the day, and deciding that I wouldnt be able to let these things go. </p>
<p>So today we had a meeting and I told them that, which equated to me quitting, all because i was broken from ostracized, and guilt tripped for a highly personal decision. </p>
<p>I like this company to and the work I did, but i abhor the fact that it had to end like this. </p>
<p>I'm honestly kind of lost today, and was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar cause of this bullshit, and how are you doing now, and di you have trouble finding better work?</p>
<p>Edit: I also wanna say that there wasnt any animosity of anything. It's just they came from vastly different circumstantial evidence regarding covid, having experienced it personally themselves. But it's still fucked that all of this is passed on "the jab"</p></p>

        <p>I quit my job over things like this (among other reasons such as a ridiculous commute and a boss who literally came out of a portal from hell) and I’m doing ok.</p>
<p>I’m fortunate in that I have savings and credit that I can live on for a while and a partner who supports me but I don’t even care what my next job is. Even if it’s just retail for 15/hr lifting boxes, you only live once and I would be happier with that than a career that made me miserable.</p>

        <p>I like your perspective, and I'm glad that ypure able to maintain a sense of ok-ness. </p>
<p>That's where I'm at too. It felt like I wouldnt be able to be genuinely happy at this place. What with ultimatums and guilt trips. My self preservation is the ultimate importance, and there will always be jobs.</p>

        <p>Thanks man. I have that feeling to, now that the initial sadness of the loss is subsiding. </p>
<p>This whole process with the vaccine goes against every instinct of mine, and I couldn't keep lying to myself, or start more intensely doing so.</p>

        <p>I left my job like 2 months ago, because they promoted biggest arsehole in our small company to be my sup. Now i hear horror stories about forcing people to take tests, wear masks, take vaccine etc. I can only laugh now. Good luck :-)</p>

        <p>If you took the vax and didn't get the placebo, you would not have that job anyway. People that don't have their health can't do anything. They are literally crippled or worse.  You made the right decision. I know a few people who have racked up thousands in medical bills after getting it and are just screwed.  You will still be physically and mentally able to work, many of those who got the jab are playing Russian roulette.</p>

        <p>Yea that's a very good point, which was one of my main concerns. But when I brought up these things, it was met with "we are in a unique situation, and only looking for guidance, for the safety of the office".</p>

        <p>They are doing child testing now and readily admit some are receiving a placebo. Experiments always have a control group. They do not have to disclose it because they make everyone sign a consent form.</p>
<p>Vaccines that receive EUA are considered experimental until the FDA formally approves it. It is possible that a rare side effect will be found after mass vaccination allows a longer term of observation on a larger number of people, but most side effects are picked up in the first several months after vaccination.</p>

        <p>Also worth pointing out that while the original trials were double-blind (neither group knew what they were given) they have now been unblinded and the control group has all been vaccinated.</p>

        <p>Are they? Springs?  I was not aware of that.</p>
<p>I have seen way too many magnet videos, and read a few whitepapers, trying to figure just what's in those syringes.</p>
<p>I think there are at least 3 different loads, not divided by manufacture (Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J) but rather by lot number with at least 2 of those 3 manufacturers.</p>
<p>One magnetic load seems to make sense, as per the whitepapers, the other does not. The non-magnetic loads could be placebo, or traditional vaccine, or god knows what.</p>
<p>Do you have a source at hand for the spring loaded syringes?</p>
<p>Would you care to share a link?</p>

        <p>They forced you out even though they didn't force you out. You had to wear a mask and were the only one that had to wear one. They obviously wanted you to show your medical records.</p>
<p>Was showing your vaccine medical history part of your job requirements before you started there? If not then why the covid vaccine? These people are high fiving themselves that you left. They are in a cult and you didn't want to be part of it. </p>

<p>Nope no medical records were required when hired. This change of policy only came about a little before the change of the CDCs mind. Before then everyone was wearing masks everywhere. But afterwards I was the only one that had to in the office, and if I was in a van with someone else we would both have to wear them.</p>

<p>It does suck because this was the only "hellish" aspect of it, and I did like the job because it was physically and mentally challenging. But that is not worth the values and concerns that I hold in regards to this whole issue. Nor does it supersede my mental wellbeing. </p>

        <p>Smaller companies are cool until it comes to something like this. When politics are brought into the workplace, and you have to work for the very people who insert politics into the workplace, it makes you want to slap them with a Leadership for Dummies book. </p>
<p>Something similar happened to me while working for a startup during the 2016 (s)election process... and then again with my job during the pandemifoolishness. </p>
<p>It hurts. It sucks. But sometimes you reach an impasse and it’s just time to go. (Even if you’re pushed to go).</p>
<p>Good riddance to that ridiculous place and their dumb, new conditions of employment! You’ll find something better suited for you because now you know more about who you are and what you want AND don’t want. </p>
<p>I hope you’ll take some time to truly relax and reflect while casually preparing for your next move. After analyzing decades of my own experience (so take it with a grain of salt), I believe that when the universe removes something from your life, it gives you something better, if you’re prepared for it. </p>
<p>All the best to you, fellow freedom fighter.</p>

        <p>If you dont have other references then I guess go ahead but I would just say you were bullied into quitting since you refused vaccination. Dont bring up the anxiety attack it will make you look crazy. For the record I dont think you are crazy but to future employees it will make them think you might be unstable and I dont think you are unstable.  I think you were put under stress and finally cracked but most people are more judgemental than me. If that's your reason for leaving at least employers who want to require vax will pass on you and your more likely to get an offer from a company anti vax or freedom of choice instead of pro vax.</p>

        <p>I understand completely.  I just don't want you to lose a job opportunity because someone else is judgemental and that  didn't understand how that pressure accumulates and makes a person snap. I'm sorry they treated you that way. They will regret their choices in  a few years.</p>

        <p>There are many places on the internet where Rule #6 on this subreddit occurs. I'm glad this place isn't one of them.</p>
<p>If I loved my job enough, I'd have looked around for such places. Indeed, I would likely go back to such a job after finding a place like that. As long as I wasn't putting anyone else at risk, I'd see no ethical problem with that and I'd likely do it.</p>
<p>I suppose the ethics of the  employer and the fact that through my work I was supporting that would eventually call upon my conscience, but I'd still have that time to find a better place to work.</p>
<p>Of course, if "viral shedding" is a thing, you may have dodged a bullet.</p>
<p>Good on you!</p>

        <p>You're better off without them. There are plenty of places you can work that want to hire you, that won't subject you that type of social pressure or anxiety. </p>
<p>Is there a reason that you didn't just tell them you had been vaccinated and then stop wearing the mask and go back to normal? This isn't meant as an attack, I'm just trying to understand the situation as I may find myself facing that situation as well soon.</p>

        <p>Yea that's what I figured as well. That's just not a healthy work environment. And I get it "that it's just a mask", but with all of the information coming out it was becoming harder and harder to justify wearing it. Especially whenever I would share my side of information, it was shut down.</p>
<p>Well this was actually the culmination of a process that had been going on for a longer time frame. </p>
<p>I remember vividly a conversation back in like feburary, to where we were in the stock room, and the topic of letting the office go maskless if full vaccination occurred. As soon as I said I wasnt getting it, there was a pause and i saw the contempt on one of my bosses face, and the shock on the other coworkers faces. Then the moment passed. But I think that's what truly started this process.</p>
<p>So no to answer your question I couldn't have just taking off the mask</p>

        <p>You should avoid this subreddit if the fear it's creating inside you is having such a negative effect on your mental health. Take this as a wake up call. You should be no more afraid of the vaccine than of COVID-19 itself. Even with the most liberal estimates of vaccine deaths, and the most conservative estimates of COVID-19 deaths, there's a greater risk of dying of COVID-19 than of dying from the vaccine. Just do the math.</p>

<p>But on that same note it's a bastion of sanity, knowing I dont have anyone like minded like this in real life. </p>
<p>Also it's a concern for the greater humanity, which is a kind of fear l I suppose, but this is something that my intuition is telling me that something is out of whack here. Trusting my intuition has got me this far, and I dont intend on that changing.</p>

        <p>Yeah, trusting your intuition got you to being unemployed now, as you said losing a job you actually liked. It might be time to re-evaluate that intuition.</p>

        <p>You're telling this poor guy that injecting himself with an experimental non approved drug that he doesn't need is more important? I'm guessing he's probably a healthy individual who may never even get covid if he hasn't already. Most of us take care of ourselves enough to not have to rely on an untested experimental drug. I think he did the right thing because they were segregating him and last time I checked I'm 💯 not ok with segregation. Maybe you are.</p>
