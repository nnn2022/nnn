    <strong>GAIN OF FUNCTION</strong>
    <p><p>It's kind of surreal to be hearing about this now because according to my recollection I stumbled across this technology last year when I was looking up anything about the Wuhan lab because at first I fully accepted the wet market hypothesis.  I couldn't find much about gain of function research at the time but I remember it sounded really strange and interesting.</p>
<p>If somebody can prove that Covid was a lab created virus and was modified to be more contagious or deadly or anything really, this is the biggest revelation in our story so far.</p>
<p>Fauci's involvement would just be one part of it.  What about all of the people complicit in covering it up and not addressing the elephant in the room that there was this lab doing this stuff in the exact same city where all of this shit started.</p>
<p>The way I see it, the obvious move would be for the Democrats to have Fauci be the sacrificial lamb and blame it all on him and Trump and his people so they can play dumb and try to retain trust with the American people.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p></p>

        <p>As to the first half of this there is some evidence (or really lack thereof for the zoonosis origin that is most widely accepted currently) that makes the laboratory origin of covid-19 possible. This mostly revolves around the fact that we have yet to find the species which was the carrier which transferred the virus to humans which is quite odd as these were quickly found for other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. The other oddity is said to be the 1378bp spike protein on SARS-Cov-2 which is claimed by some scientists to be unnatural in origin and most consistent with a man made origin though admittedly this is disputed.</p>
<p>As to the second half of this post though I have no idea what you meant or where you are going with that. If created in a lab the papers which conclude it as likely are on the consensus it is likely it is the very lab in Wuhan which studied coronaviruses as well as many other infectious diseases and was thus a Chinese project. As for everything in the US it seems to only used for political gain by the likes of politicians and people like Fauci because literally anything that can be used for money and power will be. I find it unlikely they had anything to do with the origin it’s just a matter of not letting a good crisis go to waste.</p>
<p>Here’s some of those papers by the way and many more can be found by just searching the topic in Google scholar you’ll find both sides.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the links.  You sound like you have a background in this field?</p>
<p>The second part of my post is just speculation on how the political fallout might occur.</p>

        <p>Yeah I think I see what you mean now rereading that second part and I think we sort of said the same thing just in different words. As to the background question though I do not have any background in the field just like reading these research papers and comparing them against each other to formulate my own opinions, but glad they could be of use to someone else to do the same.</p>
