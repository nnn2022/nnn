        <p>There’s some suspicion that the Mississippi Health Commissioner might bring back the state’s school mask mandate. I don’t know if the governor would have the authority to overrule him. </p>
<p>This might be an attempt to justify reimposing masks in schools in the next few days.</p>

        <p>Viruses evolve.</p>
<p>If the vaccines work - and they might do, I am a "wait and see" NNNer, then what we have done is exhausted the adult host supply and forced the virus to evolve and find a new host supply.</p>
<p>Children.</p>
<p>Or it could be propaganda.</p>
<p>The issue is figuring out what the bullshit is and isn't is a mugs game. Has one going in circles.</p>
<p>I am now reliant only on my immediate anecdotal data. I am aware it is a small sample size,but the large datasets are filled with BS data - purposeful or accidental doesn't matter. The numbers over the last 1.5 years are just nonsensical and don't trend well at all or trend so textbook one has to wonder of the validity.</p>
<p>Had a fellow student do that once at Uni. Made up the data (no published stuff, just coursework) and handed it all in.</p>
<p>Lecturer said his numbers were bang on exact textbook ratios and data never looks this clean LOL. Got removed for cheating/lying.</p>
<p>He's probably doingthe numbers for Covid somewhere.</p>

        <p>What the heck is going on over there in that area? I keep seeing a ton of crazy posts making it look like the end of the world in Mississippi and Kentucky. I even had a nurse who said there was no room to put covid patients, so many are dying. Our hospitals on the northwest are empty. Why can't they bring them here? I'm just saying..if it's REALLY like Armageddon over there, why are some of my friends in the area not hearing anything locally? Why do my hospitals know nothing about it? Is the US just selecting certain sections to stage this stuff? I still can't get any of these nurses to prove they are real nurses.</p>

        <p>This would be more informative if we knew the age of the kids, especially when they're pushing vaccines for those twelve and older. I'm sure depending on who the kids and their families are, attitudes and criticism of them might change.</p>
<p>Many were worried when MIS-C was in the news last year and around 250 kids had died. That was mostly forgotten and so will this.</p>
<p>This was a recent tweet by CDC Directory Walensky</p>
<p>&rt;<a href="https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1408116464683569157">To put this into perspective, if we vaccinate 1 million 12-17 year olds, we could see 30-40 MILD cases of myocarditis. In this same 1 million, through vaccination we AVOID: 8,000 cases of COVID-19, 200 hospitalizations, 50 ICU stays &amp; 1 death. The benefits far outweigh the risks.</a></p>

        <p>&rt;CORRECTION: 7 MS children are in ICUs with COVID, with 2 on ventilators, Dobbs says</p>
<p>Of course the article is updated a day later when everyone reported on it.</p>
<p>Way overblown. How does a hospital and public health doctor get it so wrong?</p>
