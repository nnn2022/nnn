    <strong>Coin magnetic to Pfizer injection spot</strong>
    <p><p>Coins will easily stick to skin, but only if you push down on it. So I figured people who claimed it stuck were mistaken.</p>
<p>But here this woman is not pushing on it, she just glides it around her skin and it doesn't stick except on the spot where she claims she got the injection:</p>

        <p>I’m not making any claims one way or another with this, but like I commented on another one of these posts, it’s not convincing unless you can see the magnet/coin being pulled—not placed—away from the fingers onto the skin. After that the arm needs to move into a position where the magnet/coin could drop, like twisting the arm so the object is facing the floor. If it still stays that would be slightly harder (but by no means impossible) to debunk. A coin will still adhere to skin without much pressure if there’s some substance on the coin/magnet/skin allowing it to grip (even a thin film of Vaseline could do it). Again not claiming anything either way, I’m a skeptic in all directions, but what is shown in this video is just not enough to convince people of anything. I’d want to at least see the skin and magnet/coin swabbed with a freshly opened alcohol prep pad first and then dried with a cotton pad to at least attempt to show there’s no moisture there holding things together.</p>

        <p>Absolutely, all this could be easily faked, could be sticky skin...</p>
<p>But then you watch this video, where nurses are failing to get a magnet to stick, until they find the exact spot and it sticks effortlessly, on both injection sites: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMeGFA7pF/</p>
<p>I've seen countless of these videos by now, so now I believe it's true until independent field testing proves otherwise.</p>
<p>If the CDC and Pfizer are so certain it's not possible, why are they completely suppressing all mention of this, when they could super easily contact these people and test this in front of a news camera to show it's not real?</p>

        <p>I’m with you, I’d like to know the answer to that question too, but I’d also like to see someone take more of the debatable variables into account before filming, to strengthen the case for those who can’t experience or see it firsthand, and also to refute those claiming this has been unquestionably debunked.</p>

        <p>I've seen people drop the magnet and then pick it up again, or turn the camera when they actually put the magnet or the coin, which messes up the test data horribly.</p>
<p>But I've seen people wipe off the warm with a towel, then wave a big ass magnet around with zero effect over both arms, until they get to the exact injection spot and it would stick even when they waved their arm around.</p>
<p>I can stick a coin to my skin, and I've seen people stick a magnet to their sticky skin, if you push it enough. But a big magnet that only sticks to a singular spot with enough force not to fall off when moving your arm? I'm looking for one now to try it myself, but I highly doubt it.</p>
<p>What's more I've seen a guy who made several test videos stick a magnet still in the wrapping to his arm. He flipped it, meaning there was no duct tape and he stuck paper/plastic to his arm. Paper does not stick to my arm...</p>

        <p>I have, yes, and what’s most convincing to me overall is really the reactions of the people in the videos, they all do seem very genuine and I don’t doubt that it’s a possibility for this to be happening. I just know there have already been articles published claiming to have debunked the footage, citing things like moisture on the skin etc, and it doesn’t reflect well on people making these magnetism claims when the evidence being presented doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. I’d just like to see footage that takes these points into account. Ideally it would be even better to have someone experiencing this phenomenon go into a doctor’s office and hand the doctor the magnet and film them observing the magnet being drawn to the skin on the vaccination site. But these homemade videos will always draw skeptics, and that’s not really in anyone’s best interest when they are already hell bent on making anyone who questions anything about these injections sound crazy.</p>

        <p>I don't know what to think either but there's just so many of them and they don't appear to be faked nor do they appear to be happenstance from moisture/angle or whatnot as some of the magnets are very small and have to be precisely placed, or so it seems.  I too would like to see what you've said.  Or I'd like to see someone do it with a small spherical magnet.</p>

        <p>Agreed—I don’t really think that people are going out of their way to fake these videos either, but the stronger the evidence the better. That’s a good idea, I’d like to see someone try it with a spherical magnet as well.</p>

        <p>These are starting to get my interest.   I'm really not sure how this is possible.   The amount of material required to hold up that magnet just couldn't be in a clear fluid injection.   But the reactions of people do seem genuine.  </p>

        <p>By all means try it. Coins are really easy for me at least, if I push a bit they'll stick anywhere on my skin and hold even when I wave my arm around.</p>
<p>But without pushing, it's impossible, or falls off instantly or at the slightest movement if I balance it on my shoulder. I've yet to get some magnets, but I've seen people use really big ones, no way that would stick to sticky skin, it's just too heavy.</p>
<p>Most of the videos I've seen show people moving the magnets all over the place with zero effect, until it gets to the spot and then it sticks with zero pushing, and holds very well.</p>
<p>Try that with a magnet, see it will stick to a singular spot to your skin without you pushing on it. If you report you can do it I'll believe you at your word and take it into consideration.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I'd have to find someone who got the shot to try it with but I'd be far more interested if the process was what I described above. It genuinely could be double sided adhesive (pick any one). I use double sided spray to hold some of my revealing tops in place and you definitely don't want or need to press anything to the skin.

        <p>Well try it on yourself to make it work even if you're not vaccinated. If so many regular Joe's are faking it so easily or overestimating the stickiness of their own skin, then surely you can too?</p>
<p>I've seen people use duct tape, stick metal pieces to their skin, duct tape a different magnet to the back of their hand so a magnet will stick to their hand... Tell us how easy it was for you to replicate, I'll try the same as soon as I can find some damn magnets.</p>

        <p>The tape still moves and you can see in the videos they don't always put the magnets back in the same spot. Regardless it's not my claim to prove, it's their's and I'm not on a disproving or debunking crusade. I'm literally saying there are other medical reasons not to get this treatment so please don't focus on shit like this. </p>

<p>Probably the most interesting video I've seen so far, because they use a very long magnet and they start rotating it. Something that sticks to skin would not hold when rotated, only magnetic force looks like that.</p>
<p>Edit there's also a strong wobble in the object. If it was sticking to skin that would not be possible.</p>

        <p>Definitely a lot of psyop stuff regarding this one. Social media is blocking all mention of it, and they instantly released statements saying it's not scientifically possible.</p>
<p>And you have a lot of people posting videos saying the magnet doesn't work on them, or they fake it to show it's a scam. But everyone of those people seemed angry when they did it, as if they're upset they can't do it or something. That's petty denial, not scientific proof.</p>

        <p>Alright, gotta add my 2 cents, well 10 actually. 
So after seeing this post the other day. I tried it yesterday morning. It took about 3 to 5 minutes to find the spot. I had my first dose of Pfizer end of April, mandated by my work (We all HAD to get it or we would get fired. My body my choice right? Sure).
Anyways. It stuck. I used a Canadian dime, which is magnetic. It was just chilling on my arm on and off all day yesterday. Every so often I would place it back on the spot to see if it was still sticking. Freaky shit I tell ya. 
I told my mom who also got her 1st dose in March. It stuck to her aswell. Got to work today and started asking people to try it. Out of the 4 who did, all 4 got it stuck to their arm. The other arm, nope. Would not stick. I have now seen this happen to 8 people including myself. Honestly it's fucking weird. I can't explain it but I can tell you from my personal experience and seeing it happen to others today, it's real. This is actually happening. 
I should note I tried a fridge magnet aswell and it would not stick. Maybe because the dime is lighter? Who the hell knows, all I know is... well... nothing really. I'm so confused. Why is it doing that when they have said countless times there is nothing magnetic in this vaccine and all these videos are "fake"?
I don't think they are tracking or implanting us with a device or whatever, I just think it's strange... very strange that it is infact sticking to people's injection site.</p>
<p><strong>all the people i know who have tried it all got the Pfizer vaccine</strong></p>
