    <strong>Breaking Down Marxist Propaganda</strong>
    <p><p>We all hear these phrases repeated over and over again in Marxist MSM to brainwash the masses with propaganda. Most of these phrases listed are contributing to nothing more than neo-tribalism, so it is important we recognize and eliminate them from our vocabulary. Use this list to as a basic guide to deprogram yourself and people you associate with.
Feel free to add more phrases that I may have missed in the comments. </p>
<p>"Anti-Masker": There is no such thing as an anti-masker since humans are not meant to wear masks. There are only people who decide to wear masks, and people who don't. The issue with masks is that it is became a stigma. Choosing to wear a mask or not dose not determine if you are a good or bad person. The phrase "anti-masker" is a from of hate speech.</p>
<p>"Conspiracy Theorist": Replace with the phrase "independent thinker". "Conspiracy Theorist" is a phrase used to create division, demiralization, hate, and fear by targeting individuals, and/or groups that have a different opinion than the mainstream narrative. </p>
<p>"Essential": A phrase used to create division and demoralization by targeting individuals, and or groups of people. The phrase "essential" has the context slipped into almost every sentance to emphisize the importance of a subject. This says everyone or every business that is deemed "non-essential" has not importance</p>
<p>"It's For Your Own Safety": No one can tell you what is in your best intrestst. Your body, your choice. </p>
<p>"Jab": Replace with the phrase "shot". </p>
<p>"Mutation": A phrase that is being used to create fear by over dramatic usage. Viruses are always mutating constantly both making them weaker and stronger. It takes years of random changes to develop a permanent mutation that will continue to spread. </p>
<p>"Supremecy/Supremecist": Race shaming only promotes more racism. For example, any color of skin to identify an individual or group metioned in MSM headlines is designed create division and hatred by targeting individuals, or ethnic groups of people.</p>
<p>"Threat To Our Democracy": Another phrase used to create division, hate, and fear by targeting individuals, and or groups. </p>
<p>"Vaccine": Replace with the phrase "shot". </p>
<p>"Variant": Another form of racism being promoted in disguise by MSM to devide people apart, and shame groups of people. The geographic location of a virus strain is not a scientific name.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah im not a white supremacist. That term is unfair, i prefer the term national socialist. Nobody can tell me whats best for my body, thats why im going to drink 40 energy drinks a day, get obese and chain smoke. Its a conspiracy, and the evidence is shady enough for it only to be a theory, but im really just a conscious thinker. Wake up sheeple, the left wants to take your penises /s</p>
