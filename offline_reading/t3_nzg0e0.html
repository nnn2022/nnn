    <strong>Just thinking about Covid stuff</strong>
    <p><p>The vaccine, officially speaking, is less dangerous than Covid.  Tangentially, we should keep in mind that (according to the CDC's own statistics) Covid is less likely to kill us than cancer or heart disease.</p>
<p>I believe the real problem isn't which one is the most dangerous.  It is that blatant censorship of very obviously qualified scientists <em>combined</em> with an obvious intent to remain ignorant of treatments such as Ivermectin along with countless other non-sensical actions have erased all of our trust in everything they tell us.</p>
<p>There's something really wrong about all of this and we're just starting to scratch the surface.  Unfortunately, there's going to be a fair number of wrong suspicions along the way to the truth.</p></p>

        <p>Hey remember when the left said "just believe her" and we're like "well what if they're falsely accused?" And they were like "oh well, gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelet, just have every man hold every man accountable!"</p>
<p>Yeah, that's how I feel about those "wrong suspicions."</p>
<p>Fuck em. If you're even medical community adjacent, take every participant down. Don't want to get caught in the crossfire? Then hold all the medical leaders accountable!</p>
