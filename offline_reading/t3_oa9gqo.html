    <strong>The ones accusing us of spreading misinformation tell people the "Vaccine" is safe and effective despite increasing evidence to the contrary.</strong>
    <p><p>That's the real misinformation, and it's fucking dangerous. Your average person is not fully aware of the risks involved in taking the jab; and if they are the other side downplays it. "Well, OF COURSE some people will have bad reactions to it but they're RARE." They tell us it's not experimental or a trial without any proof whatsoever; they claim all the VAERS reports and poor souls posting on the CovidVaccinated subreddit are fake and just "anti-vaxxers" pushing their agenda (what agenda that is I have no idea as there is no financial or any sort of incentive behind it other than to warn people about the truth about what's going on); and they scoff at the possible long term effects, something we should all be concerned about.</p>
<p>They call us fascists whilst demanding we be forcibly vaccinated under the threat of segregation or worse, submit to government authority without question or complaint and ignore everything that's going on around us and gulp down the Kool-Aid with the rest of them because they're too smooth-brained and spineless to form a coherent thought themselves that isn't force-fed to them by mainstream media and then shat out their fucking mouths in bile-soaked word-pellets like some sort of brainwashed human Pez dispenser. Rest assured these people are afraid they've made a terrible decision and they want us all to fucking jump off the cliff with them like a herd of lemmings.</p>

        <p>Aldous Huxley writes in 1958:</p>
<p><strong>That we are being propelled in the direction of Brave New World is obvious. But no less obvious is the fact that we can, if we so desire, refuse to co-operate with the blind forces that are propelling us.</strong> For the moment, however, <strong>the wish to resist does not seem to be very strong</strong> or very widespread. As Mr. William Whyte has shown in his remarkable book, <em>The Organization Man</em>, a new Social Ethic is replacing our traditional ethical system—the system in which the individual is 
primary. <strong>The key words in this Social Ethic are "adjustment," "adaptation," "socially orientated behavior," "belongingness," "acquisition of social skills," "team work," "group living," "group loyalty,” "group dynamics," "group thinking," "group creativity." Its basic assumption is that the social whole has greater worth and significance than its individual parts, that inborn biological differences should be sacrificed to cultural uniformity, that the rights of the collectivity take precedence over what the eighteenth century called the Rights of Man.</strong> According to the Social Ethic, Jesus was completely wrong in asserting that the Sabbath was made for man. On the contrary, man was made for the Sabbath, and must sacrifice his inherited idiosyncrasies and pretend to be the kind of standardized good mixer that organizers of group activity regard as ideal for their purposes. <strong>This ideal man is the man who displays "dynamic conformity”(delicious phrase!) and an intense loyalty to the group, an unflagging desire to subordinate himself, to belong.”</strong>

        <p>But our immune systems are set up to deal with things like coronaviruses. We have no idea how a cytotoxic package of lipid nanoparticles and RNA with instructions to make a cytotoxic spike protein will play out in the human body. Best example is immunotherapy for cancer, the closest thing in practice. I’ll let you read that literature yourself, Mr. Shit.</p>

        <p>Funny thing is...most of the people getting vaccinated aren't doctors, they aren't medically trained or informed. These people made a HIGHLY EMOTIONAL decision about as emotional as a woman's leaky menstruation when they got their shots. They know fucking NOTHING about what's even in the special sauce <em>waxeeen</em> but mama, papa, and big caring government said but muh <em>waxeeen</em> good but muh <em>waxeeen</em> safe 👶. </p>
<p>I've yet to hear an argument from the simpletons that isn't comparable to "It's safe because eVeRyOnE is getting it" or literally "tHe tRuStEd gOvErnMeNt dOcTorS said it was safe". The difference between us and them is that we acknowledge that we don't fucking KNOW a thing about that "vaccine" and we're FUCKING HEALTHY without it so why inject the SHIT? </p>

        <p>There's mixed evidence related to both safety and efficacy. If a game has mixed reviews on steam then the same pro lockdown doomers steer clear of it. If a car had mixed reviews with regards to safety all models would instantly be recalled and you'd either get your money back or get a different model. If a vaccine has mixed reviews it's because you're racist, it's fake news and we need more censorship.</p>

        <p>There is a thing called "escalation of commitment" where people stick to their original opinion and course of action even when the evidence mounts that it's a really bad idea.</p>
<p>&rt;Escalation of commitment is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from a decision, action, or investment nevertheless continues the behavior instead of altering course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment</a></p>
<p>People have a really strong aversion to being wrong. They dislike being wrong so much they'll double down on all their wrong choices just because they can't admit that they were deceived or mistaken. Ego gets in the way of clear thinking an awfu lot of the time. That's why it's useful for all of us to regularly consider the possibility that we're mistaken about some things. It's just good discipline to get in the habit of examining your assumptions, otherwise escalation of commitment and other cognitive biases can stop you taking evidence on board which contradicts existing prejudices.</p>
<p>For example, I could get bogged down feeling embarrassed that I was actually pro-mask a year ago. But the embarrassment is no big deal. By letting go of it, I can let go of the need to hold on to the belief that turned out to be a mistaken one. I've seen evidence now that masks are next to useless, so I've had to change my mind.</p>
<p>The problem isn't being mistaken. The problem is not being able to recognise and correct the mistake.</p>

        <p>I even saw someone claiming that the Astra Zeneca vaccine was safe and that it wasn't directly related to blood clots, even after Canada had cancelled it for first doses and admitted that it caused people to get sick or die of blood clots. I should have reported that person for misinformation, but I didn't think of it at the time (since I'm not an asshole, I guess) and I can't remember where the post was now.</p>

        <p>one reason the authorities are downplaying the risks of vaccines is the fear of anti-vaxxers. whose inanity has led to a re-emergence of measles, and other easily preventable diseases.</p>
<p>yes, the government is full of shit. they are not primarily on your side. but because they (for their own benefit) want to keep society going, they are now responsible for this shit.</p>
<p>the vaccines are rushed and sub-optimal.  they are promoted because the public health  response was - and is - criminal. the vaccines are probably OK, but they might be quite bad long-term. we don't know. this sucks, and it's better than the alternatives (since sensible public health responses are apparently off the table for economic and cultural reasons). if the vaccines are 20x more harmful than they appear, it's still better than nothing.</p>
<p>It's triage, because society has failed.  I applaud your appeal to rationality. Use it here to compare risk.</p>
<p>Or if this is performative, just vent. That's why we get treated like children</p>

        <p>Then by your logic I say let the virus do it's thing and cull the infirm, immune compromised and elderly.
If the vaccines are 20X more harmful then they appear then it's worse than the virus.
BTW therapeutics are better than the jab as you build natural immunity without all the inconvenient 🤡 side effects of the jab.</p>

        <p>The argument of 'let the infirm, immune compromised and elderly die, I don't care because it doesn't affect me' is the same as 'let the elderly die alone, isolated, without support &amp; care and let some younger people die because we used them as test subjects, and also let some more people die because they succumbed to depression or they couldn't see a doctor'.</p>
<p>We're all gambling with people's lives, don't you think? The difference is that we don't want anything from you. And we also seem to prioritize people with a couple of decades life left to live instead of people at the final stage of their lives. The death of a teenager or a 40-something aged mother with a couple of kids is somewhat more tragic than the death of grandma Gertrude who married young, had a successful career and multiple children, traveled, danced, sang and lived a full and enjoyable life in general. Grandma Gertrude reached her full potential and now her body is falling apart. She has nothing to look forward to, especially now that places are closed and her family isn't allowed to see her. The other 2 characters had their whole lives ahead of them but unfortunately the stupid policies we supported cut their lives short. </p>
<p>Also we're not saying 'let older people die'. A more nuanced view would be 'older people don't have much time left on this planet and their deaths shouldn't be blamed on unsuspecting young people they've never even met, and perhaps certain institutions should have put more effort into protecting them without destroying the fabric of society. I don't want to feel responsible because certain government officials moved infected people into the care homes, or neglected the old people until they forgot how to talk and move and eventually died, or put a DNR order on them. That's not my fault.</p>
<p>You're operating on the assumption that we're all 'sick until proven healthy' and until you let go of that mindset, you won't understand what the hell is this sub about. The problem is, this can be applied to anything. Tomorrow I can demand restrictions for men because they commit 95% of all homicides. Or I might demand that alcohol should be banned because some people drink and drive. Or I might want driving to be banned altogether. Imagine tomorrow scientists invented a tool that can identify people who are more likely to commit a crime, and decided to impose restrictions on them. Would you support that? Or would you find it intrusive and unfair? What if it turned out that every 3rd or 4th person on this planet and is in some way unfit and a some point in their life they might be responsible for something bad? Should we have to restrict and punish people before they've been guilty of anything if it was proven (or rather 'proven') to save lives?</p>

        <p>Sadly as a collective we have failed the elderly.
None of them should have to die alone but when the children ship their parents off to an old age home, because reasons........ they've pretty much sealed their fate.
All death no matter what age is tragic in that we lose all the accumulated life experiences of that person.
You can bet that if some scumbag tried to stop me from seeing my grandma Gertrude it would be a bad day for everyone.
Every day is a gift, that's why it's called the present.........Live it accordingly and everyone should stop being so scared.
The point of life is not to arrive at your grave safely wrapped in bubble packing but to powerslide into it scarred and dented in a cloud of dust saying What a Ride!</p>

        <p>Well, that's a better response than the "lol, stupid labrat" nonsense that exists around here......so you deserve a sensible reply.</p>
<p>Firstly, these arguments are not the same - at no point have i proposed anything akin to "let the elderly die alone, isolated, without support &amp; care and let some younger people die because we used them as test subjects, and also let some more people die because they succumbed to depression or they couldn't see a doctor".  I'm explicitly in favour of a sensible public health policy - obviously this would include support and care for the elderly, well regulated medical studies, access to health services including mental health.  We can debate the specific details, but (assuming you're also in favour of these things) this is a false dichotomy.  The suggestion that good public health policy requires us to abandon the old to protect the young - or to abandon the young to protect the old - is patently untrue.</p>
<p>And yes, public health policy is to some degree a gamble, and it will necessarily involve risk trade-offs.  Medical research involves risks, and vaccines involve risk - because all medical interventions involve risk.  Not intervening medically involves risk too.</p>
<p>The difference is between a good gamble and a bad gamble.  A large risk is not the same as a small risk.  And while the data won't be epistemologically undeniable or unipolar, it does lend far more support to some arguments over others.</p>
<p>And it also matters who is paying for the risk.  The framing here in terms of "restrict and punish people" is weird to me.  Maybe it's a US thing (that's an assumption), but it seems to value personal convenience and low levels of risk above high levels of risk where somebody else has to pay the tab.  Someone who didn't choose to accept it.</p>
<p>This is a re-occurring problem with anti-vax narratives - it's a form of NIMBYism.  And when people are unwilling to wear a mask, because they value their personal convenience higher than the risk of death to others, they should be rebuked.</p>

        <p>But if the vaccine is 20 times worse than it appears to be, young people should not be taking it. If there is a 1 in 10000 chance of death following a vaccine shot, a young person should probably skip the vaccine shot, because there is only one in four chance of getting covid in a given year.</p>

        <p>run the maths on that again  (and remember we're assuming that it's 20x worse than it appears, but i'll otherwise take the data at face value)</p>
<p>1 in 10,000 for the vaccine puts the risk at 0.01%.  There are many ways you can estimate the covid fatality risk - since this varies over time, by country and by statistical methodology.  but pick whichever one you want.  It's simply way higher than 0.01% (and remember that this is a risk per year).</p>
<p>you've also got to remember that the 1 in 4 chance of getting covid is heavily dependent on transmission rates in the community.  and covid survival rates are heavily influenced by the strain on health services caused by covid infections that resolve well (noting that we also have no idea of the long term negative effects of a relatively moderate covid infection). So even if we exclude the worst-case outcomes......the 25% of the population who get covid and make an (apparently) full recovery put a lot more strain on the health and economic system than the &lt;1% of the population who have an adverse reaction to a vaccine.  </p>
<p>these numbers are not close.</p>
<p>once you start including broader factors into consideration, the comparable risks of vaccine uptake and ongoing covid transmission in the community should be clear.  if the maths only considers the personal risk/reward choice - and excludes the broader public health impacts - then it fundamentally mis-frames the question.</p>
<p>if this is intentional (for example, because of a ethical framework that intrinsically values personal freedom at any level over public responsibility at any level), then we're no longer debating a public health question, but are having a philosophical debate over the social contract.  which is fine, we just need to be explicit about it</p>

        <p>First, in some population cohorts, covid IFR is lower than 0.01%. </p>
<p>Second, 25% of infection risk per year is average, and it includes all the people who fail to observe minimal precautions. For anyone who is careful the risk of infection is lower than average. And, as you said, for anyone who lives in a community with low transmission rate it is also lower. So, the drive to vaccinate everyone is dangerous for the people who are at lower risk for covid, because their risk due to vaccination is higher.</p>
<p>Third, covid hospitalization rate is between 4 and 5 percent on average and it is unlikely to shoot upwards and overwhelm medical facilities as we have seen last year and as vaccination rollout is proceeding.</p>

        <p>like i said, if you're only counting the individual risk/reward trade-off, then we're not having a debate about public health policy. we're talking about a radical re-framing of the social contract. and do you have a source for the cohorts that are &lt;0.01% covid IFR? (off-topic, but genuinely interested)</p>
<p>in any case, either include the externalised costs of individual choices into your analysis, or justify its exclusion. if you want proceed from an assertion that individual choices bear zero responsibility for external impacts, that's a coherent position. but do so explicitly, because it's not the social or cultural norm.</p>
<p>there's obviously a collective goods free-rider problem here. how this should be responded to (if at all) is debatable.  but it needs to be recognised and accounted for in some way.</p>
<p>if the only question on the table is "what should I do in my personal best interest" then we've got nothing to discuss, since public health policy would be untenable as an explanatory concept</p>

        <p>When we are talking about population cohorts whose risk outweighs reward, we are not talking explicitly about individuals. If I were a physician who saw that all of  his young patients will be taking more risks from vaccination than possible benefit, I would be ethically bound to at least warn them and perhaps to talk them out of it on not recommend the vaccination.</p>
<p>The actual vaccine risks are not bounded at 20 times worse than at present. They are unknown because no long term studies exist.</p>

        <p>yes, this kind of childish thinking is precisely your fault. yes, i assume the drug companies are amorally pursuing profit (which is what i said, read it again.  think more about your insults, and make them better).</p>
<p>if we had a society full of adults instead of scared little children, then we' could regulate big pharma to minimise the risk of their amoral profit seeking.  but we can't have nice things like sensible public policy, because too many citizens can be cheaply bought off with convenience and empty rhetoric.  </p>

        <p>"i do my research". "i don't want one". "Daddy Gov't"</p>
<p>this is precisely what i mean by childish. this is precisely why we can't have a reasonable debate about public health policy. i don't have feelings about the government - it's just not a part of my identity. i don't have feelings about my car either, i just want to go to my destination, and not off a cliff. this is a fundamentally different way of viewing the world.</p>
<p>personally, i work from home, and Covid is of minimal risk to me. that's not the point. other people are dying from it, and because i live in a first world country, i demand that my government enacts sensible public health policies to minimize harm. this is so obvious it should be trivial.</p>
<p>don't pretend you're forming opinions based on evidence and consistent analysis. this kind of transparent lying is why legitimate concerns about vaccines get ignored. this is literally the point i'm making.</p>

        <p>Homie, I'm not pretending. I don't have time to really reply to this in detail, so I'm going to reuse another response I posted elsewhere: </p>
<p><em>I respectfully disagree that sharing a journal article for discussion is somehow reprehensible or irresponsible or 'spreading lies.' As I said, I hope the paper is absolutely wrong.</em> <br>
<em>But these are the same folks who got the country hooked on Oxycontin, the 'less addictive' form of pharmaceutical heroin. They, the pharma companies, are motivated by profit first, safety second. That's just the nature of the beast; I'm not suggesting anything more nefarious than that, and that doesn't mean they don't make incredible scientific advances.</em><br>
<em>Since I've had COVID-19 already, and since I still have the antibodies, I just don't think there's a reason for me to be vaccinated. Viruses of course always mutate, but it's also well known now that the vaccine does not prevent transmission – just reduces the severity of the disease and thus the likeliness of hospitalization. In fact, most people now dying from COVID-19 have been vaccinated. So the vaccinated could just as easily be such a 'mutation vector.' There's also evidence that these new variants are more contagious and less deadly, as often happens when viruses mutate; it's a better survival strategy and consistent with evolutionary theory.</em><br>
<em>The way these mRNA vaccines work is fundamentally new, and I believe there is evidence we don't have all the kinks worked out. We've never before used a package of lipid nanoparticles housing artificial RNA to direct cells to manufacture a spike protein. We will, probably, eventually, work out those kinks, and that will be a great thing for humanity. But there is evidence that both the spike protein and lipid nanoparticles are cytotoxic.</em><br>
<em>In my opinion, it is actually more harmful to not discuss these things openly. In December of last year, a paper in Science warned we should inform the public with better transparency about the side effects of the vaccines. I happen to agree.</em><br>
