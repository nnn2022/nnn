    <strong>Easy way to notice this isn't about lives of people.</strong>
    <p><p>Each year, 4 million humans loose their lives because of obesity, which is also counted and listed as a disease. 4 whole million.
No one wants to be obese, obesity is caused by ignorance.</p>
<p>I don't see restaurants measuring your weight before entering, or governments closing down fast food places. Or limiting what food is sold in supermarkets.</p>
<p>All of these listed above wouldn't help then win any money, so why bother.
So... They don't care about those 4 million?!?!?! How could they?!?!?! </p>
<p>2 million COVID deaths in a year and suddenly we have to destroy millions of jobs... It's like those 4 million didn't matter!</p></p>
