        <p>Why I don't believe ANY of the numbers. If someone gets shot, and goes to the hospital, if they tested positive, they will be counted as a "cOvId hOsPiTaLiZaTiOn" despite coming with a gunshot!</p>

        <p>just in case, that you  or someone reading your comment thinks, that you are exaggerating with it.</p>

<p>remember, that the scam is run worldwide and uses the same  lies.</p>
<p>in this case a person falling from a 10ft ladder and dying is also called a "covid-19 death" ;)</p>
<p>this statement by this post above from this parasite  also gets mirrored by tons of other governments. they are saying it or writing it down for you.</p>
<p>uk government saying, that they count everyone who dies with a positive test within 28 days prior to the death:</p>
<p><a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths">https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/deaths</a> </p>
<p>" Number of deaths of people who had had a positive test result for COVID-19 and died within 28 days of the first positive test.  "</p>
<p>and here is the traitor austrian government saying the same thing just in german:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Neuartiges-Coronavirus-(2019-nCov).html">https://www.sozialministerium.at/Informationen-zum-Coronavirus/Neuartiges-Coronavirus-(2019-nCov).html</a> </p>
<p>" (1) Jede verstorbene Person, die zuvor COVID-positiv getestet wurde, wird in der Statistik als „COVID-Tote/r“ geführt, unabhängig davon, ob sie direkt an den Folgen der Viruserkrankung selbst oder „mit dem Virus“ (an einer potentiell anderen Todesursache) verstorben ist. "</p>
<p>feel free to share those links with anyone you know, who still thinks, that any of the numbers are real, or that it must be just one government, who lies about the numbers.</p>

        <p>most doctors and nurses will blindly follow guidelines, despite them killing patients.</p>
<p>some nurses and doctors will do the right though and come forth and talk about the horrors, that were actually going on in hospitals  as they were murdering people:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8262351/Nurse-New-York-claims-city-killing-COVID-19-patients-putting-ventilators.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8262351/Nurse-New-York-claims-city-killing-COVID-19-patients-putting-ventilators.html</a> </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sara said COVID-19 patients are placed on ventilators rather than less invasive CPAP or BiPAP machines due to fears about the virus spreading</strong></li>
<li><strong>She explained: 'The ventilators have high pressure, which then causes barotrauma, it causes trauma to the lungs'</strong> </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/nearly-9-in-10-covid-19-patients-who-are-put-on-a-ventilator-die-new-york-hospital-data-suggests/ar-BB137d0z">https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/nearly-9-in-10-covid-19-patients-who-are-put-on-a-ventilator-die-new-york-hospital-data-suggests/ar-BB137d0z</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-analysis-recommends-less-reliance-on-ventilators/">https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/21/coronavirus-analysis-recommends-less-reliance-on-ventilators/</a> </p>
<p>so this is in regards of straight up murdering patients through deadly wrong treatments.</p>
<p>HOWEVER  we can look at just the financial interest in regards to calling something "covid-19 death" on death certificates:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR2fY7dVdMo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AR2fY7dVdMo</a> </p>
<p>there are MASSIVE! incentives to call something "covid-19". if you put them on ventilators you get even tons more money as the hospital.</p>
<p>so no, you don't need to have every nurse and doctor involved in a huge conspiracy for this scam.</p>
<p>all you need to do is to push deadly guidelines + HUGE financial interest onto them and the hospitals and it will "work out" for the agenda, not for the patients of course or for creating real numbers.</p>

        <p>So have these cases been reported to the relevant authorities? The authorities that are supposed to regulate incorrect treatment and behaviours?</p>
<p>Do you have evidence to suggest these authorities are looking away whilst this is going on?</p>

        <p>hahaha :D</p>
<p>it seems, that you are quite new to the dystopian top down nightmare we're in lol.</p>
<p>what happens to doctors and nurses not blindly accepting the insanity going on?</p>
<p>well they might get their license revoked by a corrupt medical board and make your life as hard as possible trying to push you to  follow  harmful guideliness.</p>
<p>recent example would be dr. paul thomas:</p>
<p><a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/support-dr-paul-thomas/?utm_source=salsa&amp;eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=55570d4a-cc58-40eb-a671-cda9ce1c8d5e">https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/support-dr-paul-thomas/?utm_source=salsa&amp;eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=55570d4a-cc58-40eb-a671-cda9ce1c8d5e</a> </p>
<p><a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/state/2020/12/05/prominent-anti-vaccine-pediatrician-dr-paul-thomas-has-license-suspended-by-the-oregon-medical-board/">https://www.wweek.com/news/state/2020/12/05/prominent-anti-vaccine-pediatrician-dr-paul-thomas-has-license-suspended-by-the-oregon-medical-board/</a> </p>
<p>the system is sick from top down.</p>
<p>why do you think doctors and nurses take to media, writing articles or making  videos?</p>
<p>because no one listens inside of the system and it comes from the top.</p>
<p>one example would be america's frontline doctors:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.americasfrontlinedoctors.com/">https://www.americasfrontlinedoctors.com/</a> </p>
<p>who present some science on lockdowns, masks and their insanity and harm as well as show a united front against the criminal actions from the governments and medical system.</p>
<p>their  summits have been HEAVILY censored from youtube, facebook and other platforms.</p>
<p>they go directly to the public, because inside the system NO ONE LISTENS! and cares.</p>
<p>another example would be OSHA (occupational safety and health administration) and osha experts.</p>
<p>the osha organisation is directly pushing the harmful unscientific propaganda of slave masks all day every day, despite the experts at osha  being fully aware, that this is unscientific and extremely harmful.</p>
<p>again no one higher up in the organisation listens and instead pushing the agenda forward.</p>
<p>so what do real osha experts do again?</p>
<p>they come forward directly to the public to tell them about the insanity and harm of masks:</p>
<p><a href="https://thehighwire.com/videos/mask-whistleblowers-tell-all/">https://thehighwire.com/videos/mask-whistleblowers-tell-all/</a> </p>
<p>this all gets done, BECAUSE no one inside of the organisations be it hospitals, osha, etc... listens.</p>

        <p>well, why don't we look at practical examples of how courts act:</p>
<p><a href="https://kenfm.de/demo-verbot-in-bremen-rechtsanwalt-markus-haintz-zum-beschluss-des-bundesverfassungsgerichtes/">https://kenfm.de/demo-verbot-in-bremen-rechtsanwalt-markus-haintz-zum-beschluss-des-bundesverfassungsgerichtes/</a> </p>
<p>in this case the traitors in the "bundesverfassungsgericht" of germany spit on the german constitution with their decision to ban this demonstration.</p>
<p>going to courts for justice CLEARLY doesn't work and isn't the magical thing, that solves all problems.</p>
<p>the person speaking btw markus haintz is a lawyer and clearly calls out how corrupt the court is.</p>
<p>"the mask of the "bundesverfassungsgericht" has fallen" to translate his final quote into english.</p>
<p>those are again not my opinions, but those decisions from high courts in germany, that completely spit on the german constitution.</p>
<p>lawsuits can be great of course, but they aren't the one solution and this is just one example.</p>
<p>in other countries however things go a bit different at least, where the courts in portugal rightfully declared PCR covid-19 tests as unreliable in their decision and "quarantines" as unlawful:</p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/</a> </p>
<p>if you are still looking for justice within their system of courts, then good luck with that as your overall strategy, but you can think about the german court decision yourself :)</p>

        <p>So just a decision which bans a organised protest and another which rules that a single PCR test is not reliable. This doesn't exactly show a giant conspiracy.</p>
<p>Any decisions which have punished doctors and nurses for inappropriate or reckless care? Any decisions which demonstrate widespread fraud?</p>
<p>And if the courts are so bad, and so is the government, and the doctors and nurses, who do you actually trust? Crackpots on the internet who write clickbait conspiracy theories? If you're so sickened by what you see, why not go out and collect some evidence?</p>

        <p>Those first two cases, it was found that BOTH men passed out at the handle and on the ladder respectively due to starvation of the brain of oxygen due to what? Yep: CoVid-19 messing with their lungs.</p>
<p>So you might want to remove them.</p>
<p>As to that thing from the U.K., I seriously doubt that is correct. Here in Maryland they were trying to push that nonsense but the Maryland Dept. of Health came out and said "No, we aren't. Unless a doctor says that the death was directly due to CoVid-19, we are not counting cancer, heart attack, etc. deaths as CoVid-19 deaths!"</p>

<p>"Those first two cases, it was found that BOTH men passed out at the handle and on the ladder respectively due to starvation of the brain of oxygen due to what? Yep: CoVid-19 messing with their lungs. "</p>
<p>what :D</p>
<p>the first case after the fox 35 report even got taken off the list of fake covid-19 deaths.</p>
<p>and the 2nd story a guy fell from a ladder and died at the scene.</p>
<p>THEN some worthless covid-19 "tests" were done and then it was claimed, that it must be this new virus, because hey there is something in his lungs.</p>
<p>even for cases, that die from respiratory tract infections,  a positive worthless pcr covid-19 "test" would be completely meaningless.</p>
<p>don't believe me?</p>
<p>go over the external peer review of the original paper, that made up the worthless pcr covid-19 tests to begin with:</p>
<p><a href="https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/">https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/</a> </p>
<p>" The decision as to which test protocols are published and made widely available lies squarely in the hands of Eurosurveillance. A decision to recognise the errors apparent in the Corman-Drosten paper has the benefit to greatly minimise human cost and suffering going forward.</p>
<p>Is it not in the best interest of Eurosurveillance to retract this paper? Our conclusion is clear. In the face of all the tremendous PCR-protocol design flaws and errors described here, we conclude: There is not much of a choice left in the framework of scientific integrity and responsibility."</p>
<p>or the portuguese court ruling, that the PCR covid-19 "tests" are unreliable garbage:</p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/">https://off-guardian.org/2020/11/20/portuguese-court-rules-pcr-tests-unreliable-quarantines-unlawful/</a> </p>
<p>my personal favorite though is this article:</p>
<p><a href="https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/">https://qz.com/africa/1850839/tanzania-president-magufuli-blames-covid-19-rise-on-faulty-tests-goats/</a> </p>
<p>showing, that the covid-19 "tests" test fruits and goats positive.</p>
<p>did the fruit also die from the supposed new virus. afterall it was plugged from a tree or sth :D</p>
<p>and btw you can't argue, that the fruit and goat cases are false positives and that every test has false positives and that must just be the case in those rare cases.</p>
<p>why can't you argue that? because the pcr covid-19 "tests" do NOT have any known false positive or false negative rates.</p>
<p>this also means, that statistics are NOT adjusted for false positive rates.</p>
<p>so when you test 100000 people and 950 people get a positive result back, yet the false positive rate is 1%, you actually have 0 positive cases in the statistic, because the positive results are below the false positive rate.</p>
<p>not stating or having any false positive rates means, that you can just test test test to fake fake fake  numbers into existence.</p>
<p>and when someone falls from a ladder, then you just do a worthless "test" and throw it into the death statistics.</p>
<p>that's how it went and that how it goes.</p>
<p>the evidence is overwhelming at this point, that all the numbers are scams.</p>

        <p>“unless the doctor says it was related to COVID 19” that’s exactly what was happening! Hospitals were getting sooo much money for COVID deaths, and they were telling the doctors to list them this way even if the doctor didn’t actually think the death was related.</p>

        <p>something important to remember is, that no doctor can state, that you died from covid-19.</p>
<p>why is that? as i already mentioned in this comment there are no covid-19 tests:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/k8ia84/birx_if_someone_dies_with_convid19_we_are/geyvjqh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/k8ia84/birx_if_someone_dies_with_convid19_we_are/geyvjqh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3</a></p>
<p>HOWEVER the 2nd part to keep in mind is, that what they claim covid-19 is has 0 unique symptoms.</p>
<p>not 1!</p>
<p>directly from pharma, sorry i mean the CDC:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsymptoms.html">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fabout%2Fsymptoms.html</a> </p>
<p>none of the listed symptoms are unique at all.</p>
<p>for someone not that familiar with the matter something like:</p>
<p>" New loss of taste or smell "</p>
<p>might sound strange to them and extremely rare, BUT that is not the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2021470/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2021470/</a> </p>
<p>"  A variety of probable causes were associated with chemosensory disor¬<br>
ders, with no single cause accounting for more than 26% of the cases (Table<br>
l).31 However, the three categories of  upper respiratory infection/cold (URI),<br>
head trauma (HT), and nasal and paranasal sinus disease (NSD) accounted<br>
for approximately 60% of patients. "</p>
<p>upper respiratory infections/colds make up 26% of the cases of loss of smell/taste in this study btw.</p>
<p>get the study from sci-hub of course as it's paywalled.</p>
<p>so again:</p>
<p>NO UNIQUE SYMPTOMS!</p>
<p>NO TESTS!</p>
<p>so NO ONE! regardless if they are a doctor, nurse, random military person or intern or politician can diagnose covid-19, because it is literally impossible to diagnose.</p>

        <p>So what is the criteria for being covid positive?  A single PCR test with say 40 cycles -- a test with a MASSIVE false positive rate.  if so that would mean that you could possibly cut the number of deaths in half, for the false positives alone.  That is to say nothing about how many died with, but not because of.</p>

        <p>I didn't realise this was new information for people. This is how deaths have been counted all over the world since day one.</p>
<p>In the UK they didn't correct it for months, and even then it was corrected from "Deaths following a positive test" to "Deaths within 1 month of a positive test"</p>
<p>So if you caught and recovered from the Kung Flu in March, but then died in a car accident in May, you were counted as a Covid death.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately it is new information for some people. Or other people just don’t..care? I’ve talked to people about this months ago and they didn’t even comprehend what it meant. They were that brainwashed that even when someone lays it out for them it’s like it just doesn’t even click. Absolutely crazy. I can’t comprehend how people can have such an inability to process information and make connections. Some people just cannot think for themselves. And these are people that have college degrees and stuff, you’d think their comprehension skills would be better than this. It’s terrifying to see.</p>

        <p>Are there any more recent sources stating the same? This was posted back in April when there was very much a "We don't really know what this virus is" sentiment across the board. While disagreeable now, I could definitely see this being an "err on the side of caution" type thing back in early April.</p>
<p>But if we're still marking it that way (and we have a recent source to back that up), its fucking laughable.</p>

        <p>I want to see actual total death rate statistics for each month based on prior years. Sure some may die from actual Covid... but many of those people were likely elderly and going to die from pneumonia or other illness. </p>
<p>I have a co-worker’s dad who died a few weeks ago (terminal illness combined with a non-functioning liver, so unrelated to Covid). He took an ambulance to the hospital (tested negative for Covid upon arrival) spent, 3 days there then went to a hospice center where he was counted as a Covid death on his certificate. Sure is it possible he contracted Covid while at the hospital or in hospice, but seems like they are padding the numbers</p>
