        <p>They were fear mongered into GETTING vaccinated, in one of the most flagrant, disturbing fear campaigns in the history of our species. I watch a baseball game &amp; every other commercial is fear porn about covid, about the god damn flu. Unbelievable amounts of money have been invested into the marketing campaign to get everyone vaccinated by a vaccine that does not provide immunity &amp; has been proven to be unsafe. Fear mongering brought each one of them to that sub and put that experimental gene therapy into their bodies.</p>

        <p>Covid has a .1% death rate, the same as the flu prior to last year when covid “eliminated” the flu. </p>
<p>The vaccine has a 1.4% death rate. 1.4% of people who have gotten the vaccine, have died, now why do you think they’re suppressing those numbers? Because they are running a very financially lucrative fear mongering campaign to get you vaccinated &amp; it’s working. We don’t even know the long term effects, that’s what’s actually scary. How many people will eventually die or have some life altering side effect? And 1.4% is what’s been reported, the real number could be several times as much, while they’ve admitted they have called every death of a person who “has” covid a “covid death”, even though many of these people have clearly died from something else. </p>
<p>I’m afraid there’s no hope for the population. The brain washing worked and when you’ve been injected, there’s no turning back.</p>

        <p>There's no regret for getting the vaccine. You're still full of shit. Most people so far that have gotten it have been older, and happened to die of natural causes after they received the vaccine. The death rates in nursing homes haven't increased after they started vaccinating old people. Not linked to the vaccine at all.</p>
