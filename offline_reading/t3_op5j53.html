    <strong>Vaccine passports are a permit to spread the virus</strong>
    <p><p>These vaccines do not provide mucosal immunity.  That means a fully vaccinated individual will have no less chance of contracting, carrying and spreading the virus during the initial mucosal infection phase (the most contagious phase).  </p>
<p>Any venue that is "fully vaccinated only" is a super-spreader event, endorsed by the government.  </p>
<p><a href="https://theconversation.com/covid-19-vaccines-are-probably-less-effective-at-preventing-transmission-than-symptoms-heres-why-156611">Source 1</a></p>
<p>&rt; And yet, the nasopharyngeal mucosa is ground zero for most coronavirus infections. So while COVID-19 vaccines may generate a response that’s highly protective against systemic disease in the lungs and other organs, the vaccines are less likely to generate strong mucosal immunity that’s effective against the mild but infectious early stage of infection in the nose and throat. We should therefore expect some difference in the vaccines’ effects on preventing severe disease and blocking infection and transmission.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733922/">Source 2</a></p>
<p>&rt; Almost all efforts at vaccine development against COVID-19 focus on systemic injection, which predominantly induces circulatory IgG antibodies and, potentially, cytotoxic T cells (18). These routes are poorly effective at generating mucosal immune responses, which can only be induced by mucosal routes of immunization, including through the NALT in the URT. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&rt; Finally we expect that efforts in vaccine development aimed at inducing mucosal immune responses and memory cells, especially in the URT, would yield benefits not seen with conventional parenteral routes of vaccine administration. Intranasal vaccines are already available against influenza and others are under development (30, 38). The advantages, in addition to needle-free administration, include the generation of both mucosal (SIgA) and circulating (IgG and IgA) antibodies, as well as T-cell responses. As discussed above, such responses might achieve desirable results not obtained with systemic immunization routes.</p></p>

        <p>Ah well. Delta is shaping up to have a much lower morbidity rate amd spreads quicker so this will all be done and over with quicker as natural immunity is a lot stronger than the mRNA experiment provides. </p>
<p>Which bots are worse? Twitter bots or Reddit bots? I can’t even look at Twitter anymore. It’s an algorithmic bot shithole these days</p>

        <p>Oh and just a friendly reminder while we're on the topic of delta: other strains were probs why vaccinated individuals in Israel still got infected, and wasn't the fault of the vaccine itself. Just putting this out there in case no one has realised yet and still thinks Israel's data disproves the vaccine's efficacy.</p>

        <p>And you ignore that just because the vaccine doesn't defend against variants, doesn't mean it doesn't defend against the original covid 19 virus. It was always supposed to only defend against the original virus. Whether or not the vaccine defends against other variants is a different matter entirely.</p>

        <p>The lung cells that the virus infects are exposed to atmosphere.  They cannot be blockaded by antibodies.</p>
<p>These cells have a lot of ACE2 receptors on them.  Viruses are very tiny.</p>
<p>There is no possible way that antibodies can prevent these lung cells from getting infected on the atmosphere side.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as "immunity" from an infection of a respiratory virus like this.</p>
<p>A person can get an infection regardless of prior infection or any vaccination.</p>
<p>As for the supposedly low rates of re-infection goes: </p>
<p>To be counted as a re-infection, an individual had to have <strong><em>ALL</em></strong> of the following be true for them:</p>
<p>1) they had to get an Infection (there's been a LOT of those)</p>
<p>2) they had to take a PCR test.  Only a fraction of infected people took a PCR test (some were mandatory or random)</p>
<p>3) they had to have a + result (false negatives are possible)</p>
<p>4) the SARS-COV-2 virus <strong><em>had to be isolated and fully sequenced</em></strong> (that's usually not done)</p>
<p>5) they had to not die, from any cause (that not too hard, but some people meeting the above so far did die)</p>
<p>6) they later had to have TWO consecutive negative PCR test results (not all of the above would bother, many were forced to)</p>
<p>7) they has to get an infection again OF A DIFFERENT STRAIN (not all actual reinfections were of different strains)</p>
<p>8) they had to take another PCR test (maybe randomly, maybe forced)</p>
<p>9) it too had to be positive</p>
<p>10) the virus in the new infection had to also be isolated and fully sequenced</p>
<p>11) the prior sequencing had to be available</p>
<p>12)  both sequencings had to be compared</p>
<p>13) the sequences had to be different enough to be confident that they were in fact different strains (not mutations developed within that individual)</p>
<p>ONLY people that ALL of those applied to were counted as "reinfections"</p>
<p>Somehow, low quantities of ALL of those conditions being true got telegraph effected into "reinfections are rare"</p>
<p>I've observed quite a LOT of occasions these past 16 months were one thing is said (such as it's rare for all of the above to be true for an individual) and pretty soon <em>everybody</em> is swearing by a misrepresention of that (such as reinfection is rare).</p>
<p>We have <em>no idea</em> how common or rare reinfections are.</p>
<p>And this is like a religious point with some people!</p>
<p>If you explain to them that you think you've had multiple reinfections, cockroaches will crawl out of the woodwork to tell everybody you eat babies, kick puppies, and rape kittens.</p>
<p>Apparently all their faith is on the idea that we will develop herd immunity and the virus will die out, I guess.</p>
<p>That's never happening for this virus anymore than it's happened for influenza nor any of the common cold viruses.</p>
