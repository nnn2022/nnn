    <strong>The Great Reset: The Last Big Lie</strong>
    <p><p>Almost all of the alternative media is currently dragging the masses into the spike protein story, but it is important to <a href="https://www.martinvrijland.nl/en/category/the-alternative-media-is-AIVD-controlled-opposition-op/">controlled opposition</a> and I will keep pointing that out. The spike protein story actually reinforces the coronavirus contagion lie.</p>
<p>To do this, you must first become acquainted with what a virus actually is. Viruses are (contrary to mainstream media and science) self-created proteins without a living core, containing code to replicate via a living host cell, with the task of cleaning the body of pollution.</p>
<p>The term spike protein refers to the spikes that are visible in the Photoshop images (see, for example, the image in this article) that we have been seeing for over a year from the (alleged) coronavirus. The fact that the coronavirus has never been made visible in a blood sample from a patient with an electron microscope according to the official method (but that too can possibly be faked Hollywood style), is because it has never been isolated. </p>
<p>The PCR test amplifies code that could be part of the (supposed) coronavirus, but that's like finding a bolt in a scrap yard at the junkyard (a bolt that's also in a Mercedes) and then pretending you have a completely intact Mercedes in it. located that junkyard.</p>
<p>The spike protein is said to be produced by the messenger RNA (mRNA) in all known coronavirus vaccines. That may well be true, whereby I explain in my book (and here on the website) that there could just as easily be a CRISPR enzyme in the vaccine that makes remote control programming possible (see <a href="https://www.martinvrijland.nl/en/news-analysis/if-you-don%27t-stick-to-social-distancing-one-and-a-half-meters-this-will-happen/">this explanation</a>).</p>
<p>Messenger RNA therefore has the task (according to the official reading) to instruct the body's own cells to produce proteins. That in itself proves one important thing, which is that human DNA is in fact a biocomputer/cell factory that can generate the code to produce molecules (protein in this case). Those proteins again consist of DNA strands, but do not have a living cell nucleus.</p>
<p>The vaccine industry itself thus confirms the fact that the body is capable of producing a virus. In this case it is called the spike protein, which is in fact nothing more than an exsosome or what we know under the name 'virus'. This so-called spike protein then has to activate the body in turn to produce ‚Äúantibodies‚Äù in order to build up immunity in case you ‚Äúcatch the virus‚Äù.</p>
<p>However, the spike protein is no more contagious than a virus itself. To understand that viruses are not contagious, it is recommended to study the background of that contagion lie (see <a href="https://www.martinvrijland.nl/en/category/corona-psyop/contagion-lie/">this article series</a>). If viruses aren't contagious, counterfeit viruses aren't "spike proteins" any more.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of last year I have shown that a 'virus' functions like a USB stick. A USB stick that is not in the USB port of the computer is like a virus that is not connected to a living host cell. It does contain code, but has no power and does nothing. You can just put the sticky in your pocket and it won't do all kinds of weird things sitting next to your computer. Do you read <a href="https://www.martinvrijland.nl/en/news-analysis/coronavirus-covid-19-about-which-we-don%27t-hear-maurice-de-hond-and-willem-engel-part-2/">this article</a> once again good to fully understand.</p>
<p>So when the alternative media scare you about the spike protein (the same alternative media that perpetuate the contamination lie), they are actually building on that same basic lie. Just as a virus does not function outside the body nor can it blow over or get into you through touch, so does the spike protein. It is a mistaken track that will be burned down as fake news, but in the meantime it reinforces the contagion idea.</p>
<p>Much more important is the messenger RNA that could also carry out other tasks. Or as Elon Musk said: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hTz2281uQI">Elon Musk on mRNA "You could turn someone into a freaking butterfly with the right DNA sequence"</a></p></p>

        <p>I'm on board with Dr. Andrew Kaufman, Dr. Tom Cowan, and Dr. Stefan Lanka say about viruses and contagion. What I wonder is if the vaccine is causing an over production of spike proteins that are damaging organs and causing blood clots. If they are, that is problematic enough  as enough people have taken the jab and there doesn't need to be contagion of the jab is killing people.</p>

        <p>Thanks for your post. It won't ever stop to amaze me, how persistent is mainstream science at defending quite unscientific and fraudulent characteristics about nature of viruses. There is simply no scientific evidence about their origin, causes of adaptive behaviour, proven causality of contagion in an isolated environment etc.</p>
<p>To the general hoax, the (now) official "speculations" about possible lab origin, leaked emails and other bs only serve to support the original <em>big lie</em>, existence of the virus itself and the pŒªandemic situation. Shifting this illusion into a subconscious level of implicit assumption.</p>
<p>Just note about Dr. Charles Lieber discovery about lipid-coated nanowires, rushing 5Œì grid deployment and it all suddenly starts to make (sinister) sense. The real hell-on-earth will burst out when these seemingly disjointed events will meet each other‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>I too was under the impression it had never been isolated‚Ä¶ but after that rude ass /u/castleofbravo responded, on behalf of the entire scientific community for the past 100 years I might add üôÑ, I looked it up.</p>
<p>This article says it has been isolated.

        <p>Great Post! Very interesting. </p>
<p>These contagion cultists ultimately don't address the causes of severe illness so they have no success treating it. Yet we're all forced to sing the praises of their snake oil. Terrain theorists- even if the medical dictators would adopt principles of prevention- ultimately it's about doing no harm with peaceful voluntarism at its core. </p>
<p>The pathogen is nothing. Peace.</p>
