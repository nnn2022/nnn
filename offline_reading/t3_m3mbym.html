    <strong>Warning signs of narcissistic personality disorder all shared by doomers</strong>
    <p><p>1.) Persistent bullying behaviors such as making fun of, threatening, degrading, or scapegoating people (including parents and other adults) - doxing and cancelling anyone who dare voice their own opinions. Anyone who has a different opinion must have a low IQ. Anti-vaxxers are filthy people. Posting pictures of people not following the rules to shame them, etc.</p>
<p>2.) Persistent need to win no matter who is hurt - their objective is to get the whole world vaccinated at any cost. Even when people experience awful side effects, the only proper response is that it was still totally worth it. Any voicing of concern is silenced. They must eradicate COVID-19 even if people starve and die of other diseases because they can’t get medical care.</p>
<p>3.) Persistent lying to benefit oneself (will lie about lying, turn lies into someone else’s fault, deflect accountability by attacking messengers who point out lies) - the ever changing narrative that they like to push. Will say anti-maskers are the reason for prolonged lockdowns when they point out lies. Will do mental gymnastics to avoid changing their narrative when it is obviously wrong. </p>
<p>4.) Egotistical view of extraordinary self-worth - they are all heroes for putting a piece of cloth over their face and sitting on their ass.</p>
<p>5.) Preoccupation with getting own needs met over other people’s - the high they get seeing you muzzled is more important than your need to breathe. Their feeling of safety is more important than your need to run your business and put food on the table.</p>
<p>6.) Entitled attitudes which lead to acting as if they deserve special treatment and to get whatever they want, no matter the circumstances - no one is stopping them from cowering in fear in their homes, but that doesn’t satisfy them. It is society that must change, not them. Everyone must act in a way that makes them feel safe. Their well being is everyone else’s responsibility.</p>
<p>7.) Aggressive responses to being criticized, wronged, or upset - irrational emotional outbursts in response to anyone behaving or thinking in a way that makes them uncomfortable </p>
<p>8.) Repetitively blaming others for bad outcomes - the reason we can’t go back to normal is that everyone else is not following the rules </p>
<p>9.) And being much more competitive than cooperative - it’s not about doing what’s best for society. It’s pro-maskers vs anti-maskers, pro-vaxxers vs anti-vaxxers. If they perceive you as being on the other team, your argument gets shut down with no consideration.</p></p>

        <p>I have thought about this as well and agree. Definitley a personality type who are falling for this obvious B.S and trying to force it upon the rest of us. The people I know who are pro Covid are Narcissists as well so it makes sense.</p>
