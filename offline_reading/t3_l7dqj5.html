    <strong>My take on why people have become maskholes.</strong>
    <p><p><em>Fear is fueling the self righteous.</em></p>
<p>Go ahead and wear a mask if it helps you function in society but that’s all it is, a psychological crutch to offer an illusion of safety to enable your basic functionality. </p>
<p>We have to realize SARS-Cov2  is like a lurking dementor to these people.</p>
<p>The leadership in the US turned the fear up to 11 to compensate for the percent of society that will inevitably not take a virus seriously without bodies littering the streets, and then realized holy shit we’ve caused panic buying and bunkering.</p>
<p>“How do we get people to rejoin society on a most basic societal level?”</p>
<p>Give them a shield!</p>
<p>Unfortunately it’s become their sword.</p>
<p>When they said masks don’t work at the beginning they were telling the truth. They don’t. Doctors in full body PPE were contracting it.</p>
<p>Reducing your viral intake by 1.7% does not keep you from infection. Ever.</p>
<p>For many people the mask has become both a virtue signal of conformity as well as offering agency to them for the first time in their lives to shame those without one, all driven by their own internalized fear of a death threat they cannot see, taste, or smell.</p>
<p>They are getting a taste of something they’ve never known before in real life; power.</p>
<p>And they’re addicted to it. It’s fascinating.</p></p>

        <p>I think "do they work and if so to what extent" are the wrong questions we need to be asking.</p>
<p>The bigger question for me at least is whether it is appropriate to for our government to have any control over what we put onto our bodies, especially when the garment covers our airways.</p>

        <p>Also the human face is the biggest differentiating factor besides our intellect that separates us from the animals. Our intellect has been under attack for a long time and now they are coming for our faces. This is going to fuck kids up really bad if we don't stop it soon. It is shocking to me how people can't see how dangerous this is for humanity. Even if the virus was several orders of magnitude worse than it is.</p>

        <p>Totally.  I have a sociology background so the faces is particularly interesting to me and people seem to undervalue the importance of our faces being critically important in non-verbal communication.</p>
<p>Before this, I probably would have assumed that to be an exaggeration but from just my limited experience at the grocery store etc. I can see how much is conveyed through our expressions etc.</p>
<p>It doesn't make communication impossible but it really adds a layer of difficulty that makes people less likely to bother.  I can only ask a cashier to repeat something 3 times before giving up because I can't see their lips move.</p>

        <p>That's interesting. I'm aware that covering the face and treating each other like lepers for many months (or years) is probably going to have a big effect in how we think. I would guess that children raised in this environment will be especially damaged. The psychopaths of the elite like to make us call this "social distancing" but let's be honest, raising a child in a  world were everyone hides their face and treats each other as if they're disgusting lepers is probably not the most socially healthy environment to be raised in, to put it lightly.</p>
<p>I actually find the fact that a bunch of psychopaths wants to tell us —normal human adults— what is social behaviour disgusting. It's such an insult to have these psychopaths act like we're the emotionally handicapped ones. And of course their idea of social is isolation, muzzles, and pretending we're all have leprosy.</p>

Yes, they are doing something terrible to so many people and we have no idea what the consequences will be.  I agree 100% with everything you said.
I think some of this stems from politicians like Gavin being influenced by tech culture where people tend to do things because they can and only much later become concerned with the consequences.  I believe it's FaceBook that popularized "move fast and break stuff" which is a good philosophy for software but has devastating consequences if applied to government policy.</p>

        <p>I'm more concerned about the impending "prove you are vaccinated or you are banned from society" bullshit. Your personal health information will become subject to public scrutiny and judgement. Will you be able to shop for food, bank, take your car to the shop, go to the movies/entertainment venue, travel in a plane, or anything else because all of a sudden "it's a private business and they can do what they want" is en vogue?</p>
<p>That's some scary shit. Judging and segregating people based on some characteristic has always worked out in history. /s</p>

        <p>I don’t see this happening- for most things anyway..there will be a number of people who aren’t advised to take the vaccine due to health risks (allergies etc). How would that be handled? Exemptions signed by an MD most likely...and there will be plenty of MD’s willing to hand out medical exemptions like candy. That is what happens for childhood vaccinations in states that only accept medical exemptions.  Surely the powers that be must realize that..</p>

        <p>The "pandemic" was probably planned long in advance. They wanted to make people so scared that people would gladly surrender their human rights. Not only that, but they want a narrative where you can be killed by other people if they do not surrender their human rights as well—so that ignorant cowards would try to enforce the measures upon their peers.</p>
<p>A new world order has been predicted by conspiracy theorists since long ago, and there was a lot of evidence for it. This is it, the long awaited new world order is now being installed. And it's going to be a hell of a ride. They prepared many decades for this installation.</p>
<p>As for the virus? The elite does not care about it at all. The virus is just for us to fear and worry about so that we will give up our rights for government protection against free people and critical thinkers.</p>
