    <strong>How the media will conflate mask-wearing with Trump’s Covid diagnosis, while ignoring the list of over 40 world leaders who’ve had it (many wearing masks) and recovered.</strong>
    <p><p>Many of these folks are in that horrible “get it and die!” demographic we keep hearing about, yet miraculously, none did.
1. 2 U.S. senators, more than a dozen House members and at least 2 governors.
2. Presidents of Guatemala, Dom. republic, U.K., Brazil, Bolivia, Belarus, Honduras, Guinea
3. Ministers from Israel (Health), Australia, Venezuela, Ghana (Health), Poland
4. Prime Minister’s from Spain (deputy), Armenia, Iran
5. Vice Presidents from India, S.Sudan, Gambia, S.Africa
6. Philippines Int. secretary, Pakistan;s parliament speaker, E.U. Negotiator
7. Prince Albert of Monaco, Prince Charles, Canada’s 1st Lady</p></p>

        <p>I just love how they’re all like “see, masks work, he didn’t wear one and now he’s sick!” But they also say “masks protect others, not the wearer”, it’s a complete contradiction. If masks don’t protect the wearer, why does it matter if he wasn’t wearing one, and if they do protect the wearer, why does it matter if anyone else isn’t wearing one? They can’t even get their own narrative straight.</p>

        <p>I don’t think a single person with more than 2 brain cells has ever said it doesn’t protect the wearer. Stop trying to act like that’s the “narrative” they’re pushing because it is not. You’re just being stupid.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry have you been living under a rock for the last few months? I cannot tell you how many times I’ve heard “masks protect others, not you”, even by <em>my doctor</em>. It is absolutely the narrative they’ve been pushing, which contradicts the “haha look at x idiot who didn’t wear a mask and got the virus” thing they love to say as well. Not stupid, just not completely ignorant like you. </p>
<p>For the record I think the efficacy of masks is negligible, but if there was any of note, of course it’d go both ways and prevent both transmission and spread. Unfortunately that is not what is being loudly pushed in our faces. So I’ll just leave you with this: if you think masks work both ways, which you clearly do, why do you give any thought to those who don’t wear them? Anyone who wants to be protected can wear one and protect themselves</p>

        <p>Again, anybody with more than a couple brain cells will tell you it’s for everybody. Nobody has ever said wearing a mask doesn’t protect yourself. That’s absolutely absurd. It’s always to protect others AND yourself. </p>
<p>To respond to your question, fuck off. Everybody should wear a mask, it’s not that fucking hard. It’s to protect yourself and yourself FROM OTHERS. If you have the virus and don’t wear a mask you’re just exposing it everywhere. </p>
<p>Your bullshit assessments are the reason why we are still not done with this shit. Our own fucking president got the disease due to a lack of care with his own staff and you people still don’t care lmao</p>

        <p>This is cute. Really. Made me chuckle. </p>
<p>My “bullshit assessments” are literally just observations. I read social comments, I read articles from “scientists”, I read the stupid stuff my local govt is putting out, on and on. If you haven’t heard the “my mask protects you, your mask protects me” bs, you clearly live with your head up your ass, which doesn’t surprise me. Again, I don’t believe it at all, but it is certainly the crap they’ve been spewing. </p>
<p>I’m not arguing further. I will not wear a mask. When I have to, it’s mesh and does nothing. I have PTSD and am not going to let the govt force me to have constant panic attacks just to go shopping and try to live my life. But more so than that, I studied this shit, which <em>I’m sure</em> you did as well. Public health/global health crises/bio degree from a top 15 university in the US, studying under some of the top minds in the field. And funnily enough when we studied viral outbreaks of the respiratory variety, it was determined masks would make not one bit of difference. I have no reason to listen to, nor believe, your cute little keyboard warrioring. Go try and indoctrinate someone who doesn’t have any knowledge in this field, because this isn’t going to work here on me, or any of us.</p>

        <p>Wait, wait, hold on a second. For the last few weeks I have been told that the mask isn't to protect the wearer from getting sick, its to keep the wearer from getting everyone else sick. Right?</p>
<p>Per the CDC, "The mask helps prevent a person from spreading the virus to others. It helps keep respiratory droplets contained and from reaching other people.  However, the protective effects—how well the mask protects healthy people from breathing in the virus—are unknown."</p>
<p>Now, I am hearing everyone say the president deserves what he got, for not wearing a mask?? Why? The same people that called me selfish and a murderer for not wearing a mask, because they don't protect me, they protect the people around me, are saying the mask would've kept the president from getting sick.</p>
<p>So, which one is it? These mask circle jerk people can't have it both ways.</p>

        <p>I can't. That's the problem. </p>
<p>In fact, scientists are the ones leading the, "masks don't keep the wearer safe, they keep the people around the wearer safe", charge. The CDC makes this point on its website. There is an entire article on it in The Atlantic. Now, I don't think The Atlantic is worth a shit but, the covid people seem to love it, so I would tell them to find it and read it. There are many articles about this supposed reason we are told to wear masks. </p>
<p>This one point, the wearing a mask to protect others garbage, has been one of the big mask arguments. I would say its been the primary argument used by the mask lovers. "You're not wearing it for you, you selfish asshole murderer" is something I have seen written or heard said time and time again. </p>
<p>Its all a bunch of bullshit.</p>
