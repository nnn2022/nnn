    <strong>Which is real?</strong>
    <p><p>So when you look at the post in this sub or any other sub that discuss corona, some times we see people saying corona is a very harmful lab grown doomsday weapon and some times we see posts that say its just a flu, so question is which one is true? Both of these allegations coming from people who question the norms about corona not people who "trust the science" by the way. So if corona is just a flue virus overly exaggerated flu by MSM, which I believe is true, what is this lab leak story? Why you need to grow a flu virus in a lab? And if it really a lab grown bio weapon why it's so harmles, even compared with seasonal flu. So I think that this lab leak story is just another hoax like pandemic itself. I don't know why they are doing this now but probably soon we'll see. What do you think about this?</p></p>

        <p>This introspection is important, absolutely.  The problem with any of these actual assessments is data quantity/quality.  We don't have good counts of actual covid cases, because PCR is the main way to assess these and it's the wrong tool.  We don't have a good count of deaths because of the ridiculous way of counting the WHO has defined.  Similar difficulties apply to the flu, because people don't really even understand what the flu is, most aren't tested for it, so both cases and deaths are estimates and guesses.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, either or both could be 10x or 1/10th the mortality we believe they are, based on the publicly available information.  That said, in general, colds are EXTREMELY mild, so a cold as dangerous as the flu is actually pretty noteworthy.  SARS variants are dangerous, but a SARS with the communicability of the common cold is also pretty scary.  Being able to design this, adding a specific cleavage site to a known dangerous disease and making it viable and infections could be a proof-of-concept for something else to come.</p>
<p>This is still all theory, but plausible and matches much of the available information.</p>

        <p>Covid is not a very dangerous flu, but it is a new flu which makes it slightly dangerous to everyone.</p>
<p>It's how our immune systems work. Basically, some people have zero protection against covid, and fortunately this number is very low, maybe 1 in 10,000 or more. But, 85% of people either have natural immunity or their adaptive immune system is sufficient to recognize and eliminate the covid infection before it becomes severe.</p>
<p>Because it is so low risk, they throw everything and the kitchen sink at it to augment numbers, including flu cases, heart problems, dementia. And because basically everyone can easily get it, and they altered the way of counting deaths, it's easy o fudge the data to whatever they want.</p>

        <p>In terms of mortality, it’s on par with the flu. </p>
<p>However, infection with COVID is a “whole body” infection and not only respiratory (hence the neurological symptoms).   “Long COVID” is a concern.</p>
<p>However, for the majority of healthy adults under 70 it is a very mild illness.</p>

        <p>Well they couldn't claim it was a lab leak at first because Trump was saying it was a lab leak. I never have believed it as it simply isn't strong enough to bother engineering, ya know ?</p>
<p>So I do think Trump jumped the gun and wanted to blame someone, decided it was manmade (or maybe even was TOLD it's manmade but then turned around and told he's crazy when he "leaked the leak" because they needed him to be crazier, BUT that's just me being a tinfoil hatter now too lol)... </p>
<p>New viruses happen occasionally, they aren't new, and they will kill off a rope of folks because we've little to zero immunity to it. Those without strong or at least mostly functioning immune systems are always going to be goners.</p>
<p>So my belief is because we're like "y'all chill, it's a flu, wash your hands" ... They've tried and tried and can't get us to believe them. Trump is now gone so we don't have to spend 24/7 news cycles complaining about him, they think everyone who disbelieves them is a Trumper, so they are telling us it's manmade to get us to comply (because "I told you so ! Trump said so !") before they drop the fake bomb that China has released something much worse than the first round of Covid and they hope it'll get us to finally fully comply.</p>
<p>The government is really taking the slow game before they feel the need to start a trench war against its own people. Dare I say they're being downright patient.. but they will never win, in the end.</p>

<p>Whomever told you that was deceiving you.  You should be extremely cautious of any other information from that source.</p>
<p>I recommend you try to start learning about the human immune system, especially including learning about the raw materials that it requires to be able to function properly.</p>
<p>It's extremely complex and actual science knows a whole lot about it, but the point is that the more you learn about it, the more you will realize just how wrong that quoted statement is.</p>
