        <p>I think the Gates', going back to his father even have had longstanding roots in eugenics, population control and other nasty stuff.</p>
<p>For those who don't know, the guy narrating in this clip is Alex Jones. I find often that those who hate Alex Jones are people who know only what others who hate him have said about him and have never seen what a fun and entertaining guy he can be. Watch any of his appearances on the Joe Rogan podcast and more recently on the Timcast IRL show and he is just a hoot. On both podcasts/livestreams they had someone factcheck him on pretty much every crazy thing he was saying and they were all, well with Alex and his hyperbolic style of taking the truth and adding a bit of "entertainment value" to it, I can say the factcheckers proved he was always going in the right direction.</p>

        <p>Little problem: I have listened to him and Alex Jones is an idiot of the highest caliber. He epitomes that old saying "Even a stopped watch is right twice a day!"</p>

        <p>Yes well that stopped watch was right more than twice a day when he was factchecked on both Joe Rogan's show and Tim Pool's. Just because you don't like what someone has to say doesn't mean they're wrong. Anyone who's reasonable has to admit two things about Alex Jones. One, he's not always right, two, he's right more often than people like to give him credit for.</p>
<p>He was right about Epstein over 10 years ago before it started to be covered by mainstream media in recent years. Nobody believed him, they said elite pedophile rings don't exist and it's just a crazy conspiracy theory.</p>

        <p>TL;DR he apologized for what he said, admitted it's not a hoax and people did die and he seemed sincere</p>
<p>I actually used to hate Alex Jones because of this and I don't now because in an attempt to prove how horrible he was for his Sandy Hook comments, I decided to get the actual clip from his infowars youtube channel so that nobody could accuse anyone of selective editing or leaving out context and when I watched the clip, he's there with two other guys talking about Sandy Hook and Jones said "I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that Sandy Hook was a hoax, a coverup and that they hired a bunch of crisis actors" then they all discussed and debated and I thought to myself...wait, that's not what it sounded like when they played a clip of him on the news. In the news clip you just hear him say "Sandy Hook was a hoax and they hired crisis actors". And it was the same clip, but the part where he mentions he's playing devil's advocate is edited out. Big change in context there.</p>
<p>I ended up looking more into it and there were some other clips of his where he did genuinely say it was a hoax, not playing devil's advocate anymore but in interviews he's done years after, he said that because he was so used to seeing the government and media lie and cover up stuff he thought that must be what's going on but he had to take a step back and realize not everything is a conspiracy and said these actual words "I don't believe it's a hoax, I know people died and I'm sorry about what I said before". He made a good point where he said that the media keeps bringing up all the time that he said it was a hoax but never mentions his apologies and because he's banned off of all social media, he has no real way to defend himself and set the record straight unless someone actively looks for it.</p>
<p>He said he never sent anyone or encouraged anyone to go to the houses of the parents whose kids had been killed. I looked for evidence of that and couldn't find any. I know there were some Sandy Hook parents on the news saying they had people who were harassing them but I think those are just people who take conspiracy theories too seriously not anyone who was encouraged by Alex Jones. He can't control what these idiots do. Like, you can't blame burger king commercials for you choosing to go out and eating their food because their advertising was convincing.</p>
<p>Sorry about the wall of text.</p>
