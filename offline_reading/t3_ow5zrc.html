    <strong>PayPal Teams Up with Far-Left Anti-Defamation League to Target Right-Wing Users</strong>
    <p><p>From <a href="https://amgreatness.com/2021/07/27/paypal-teams-up-with-far-left-anti-defamation-league-to-target-right-wing-users/">https://amgreatness.com/2021/07/27/paypal-teams-up-with-far-left-anti-defamation-league-to-target-right-wing-users/</a></p>
<p><em>I am posting this here because we, members of this subreddit, might at some point find ourselves dealing with this problem in the near future!</em></p>
<p>By Eric Lendrum </p>
<p>On Monday, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a far-left hate group, announced a new initiative in conjunction with the online payment processor PayPal, aimed at targeting so-called “extremist and hate movements” on the platform, the <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2021/07/26/paypal-anti-defamation-league-jonathan-greenblatt-combat-extremism-tucker-carlson-paypal/"><em>Daily Caller</em></a> reports.</p>
<p>The partnership is led by the ADL’s “Center on Extremism,” and will involve the ADL studying the use of PayPal’s services by alleged “extremists,” and sharing their findings with politicians and law enforcement, for the purpose of disrupting “the financial pipelines that support extremist and hate movements.” PayPal’s Chief Risk Officer Aaron Karczmer released a statement celebrating the new program as having the potential to make “an even greater impact than any of us could do on our own.”</p>
<p>PayPal has frequently and exclusively targeted conservatives in recent years, while ignoring actual extremism from the Left. Following the peaceful protests at the United States Capitol on January 6th, PayPal suspended its services for several organizations and individuals that paid for travel expenses for people attending the march, which was in protest of the widespread voter fraud that took place in the 2020 election. PayPal also banned the anti-terrorism website Jihad Watch in August of 2017, after Antifa and Black Lives Matter rioters attacked a peaceful right-wing protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, leading to the death of one left-wing protester.</p>
<p>The announcement of the initiative declared that it will primarily focus on “anti-government organizations,” as well as groups that are allegedly “spreading and profiting from all forms of hate and bigotry against any community.”</p>
<p>ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt congratulated himself for his new initiative, saying that he was “thrilled to announce ADL’s new partnership to fight extremism with PayPal. We have a unique opportunity to further understand how hate spreads and develop key insights that will inform the efforts of the financial industry, law enforcement, and our communities in mitigating extremist threats.”</p>
<p>Another ADL spokesperson, Sindy Benavides, openly called for more censorship of conservatives by private companies, admitting that it was her “hope to see more private and public partnerships such as these to help raise the social awareness of the public to the dangers that exist in plain sight.”</p>
<p>The ADL has a history of falsely labeling individuals and groups as hateful, racist, or extremist. The group had falsely labeled Pat Buchanan, a former White House official in the Nixon and Reagan Administrations, presidential candidate, and acclaimed author, as an “unrepentant bigot.” They also accused Fox News star Tucker Carlson of spreading “dangerous race-baiting, extreme rhetoric” and using “classic White supremacist tropes.”</p></p>

        <p>I don't really use my PayPal very much anymore so they can fucking cancel me. I will never use their service again after this. What they are doing is absolutely terrible.</p>

        <p>I was permanently banned from PayPal this year.  I still have no idea why.  </p>
<p>Listen to this story.</p>
<p>I was just permanently banned.  No warning, no violation cited.  Nothing.  Just: "You can not use PayPal anymore.  Oh, and by the way we are freezing you account balance for six months."</p>
<p>This was the email I woke up to one day.  Naturally, I called the company to inquire.</p>
<p>I spent over four hours on the phone, finally cumulating into a massive showdown between Supervisor "Mike", and me.</p>
<p>He said: "We're banning you permanently, we're not going to tell you why, we're not even going to hint at why, we didn't make a mistake, we've finished our investigation, our decision is final, no appeals.  Oh.  And we're keeping your money for six months."</p>
<p>He basically told me to go fuck myself.</p>
<p>To this day I have no idea why I have been permanently banned from PayPal.  I wouldn't even believe it if someone else told me, but it's true.  This happened.</p>
<p>This is after a 15 year relationship where I have paid thousands in fees over the years.  Never a complaint or a violation.  Suddenly, permanent ban.</p>
<p>Also, keeping my balance.  I said (after two hours of trying to find out why): "Okay whatever.  Close my account and give me my money back."</p>
<p>"Can't do that.  PayPal is under no obligation to tell you the reason.  It is an internal matter.  It may be related to the investigation."</p>
<p>"What investigation?  I'm under investigation!?!?"</p>
<p>"PayPal is under no obligation to inform you of its security practices."</p>
<p>"You can't just keep my money like that.  That's against the User Agreement."</p>
<p>"No, it isn't.  And go ahead and take us to court."</p>
<p>"Are you sure a mistake hasn't been made?"</p>
<p>"PayPal doesn't make mistakes sir." (I'm not kidding you, those were his exact words).</p>
<p>"So your decision is final and you are finished the investigation?"</p>
<p>"Yes sir."</p>
<p>"So you can give me my money back."</p>
<p>"It may be related to another investigation.  PayPal is under no obligation to inform you of its security practices."</p>
<p>I've escalated at every level.  I've exchanged emails with apparently high ranking PayPal Officials, but they all basically tell me to go and fuck myself.  I have never seen anything like it.  And I have no idea why.</p>
