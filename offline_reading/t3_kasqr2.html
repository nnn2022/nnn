    <p><p>that was a strong title. but holy shit the culture of "i wanna stay indoors" is insufferable, and there's a very clear and district overlap between the people who say that stuff and the people who support making sure young children turn out the same way</p></p>

        <p>I’m glad someone said it. </p>
<p>Imagine living a life where all you have to look forward to on a day-to-day basis is vidya games, porn and anime. No friends. No family. No job. No education. No contact with the outside world. Now those people expect us all to ‘adapt’ to living like them for 10 months. Fuck these insensitive social rejects.</p>
<p>In March I saw these same people making incel manifestos about how they were glad everyone gets to feel how they feel. That they’ve finally gotten a chance to bring the ‘popular kids’ down.</p>
<p>They were friendless shut-ins before the lockdowns and they always will be. Misery loves company.</p>

        <p>It's fucking miserable.  I've been out of work for almost a month now.  The first week was alright, but I am now slipping into a deep fucking depression and neuroticism.  Every day I just look at job listings, sending out a shotgun blast of applications and hoping somebody will actually get in touch with me.  The closest I've gotten to an interview is that automated phone screening on Indeed where you have to answer pre-recorded questions, and I refuse to do it.  I refuse to talk to a robot.  I want to talk to a real fucking person.  Give me a regular fucking interview with a real person.  Everybody is so reluctant and scared to talk to each other now, and because of it I can barely get a job to survive.  I can't enjoy anything, cause I am too anxious about how I am going to survive.  Can't fucking go anywhere.  Fuck this lifestyle.</p>

        <p>At this point, anything to get you out the house would be good for you. I have never been so happy to work home care, being CA, the pay's OK, but the value of going out &amp; being the strong one &amp; caring for someone else. I highly recommend it. IHSS pays shit, but there's plenty of work &amp; it's valuable.</p>
<p>If you can pass a criminal record check, I'd say take it as a filler. Good luck mate.</p>

        <p>This feels a bit like catastrophizing. Sorry about your job hunt. Just because <em>you</em> are having trouble finding a job doesn't mean everyone is. Have you considered that it may be the candidate, not the interviewer? </p>
<p>&rt;Everybody is so reluctant and scared to talk to each other now, and because of it I can barely get a job to survive.</p>
<p>Again, this feels like a generalization based on individual experience rather than any real facts. And frankly, it's naive to blame one's own problems on society. If you can't get a job, it's not because people are scared to talk to you, it's because there's consistently been another candidate who is more qualified and presents themself better than you. This is not society's problem, this is <em>your</em> problem. </p>
<p>So quit bitching on Reddit about it all and pull yourself up by your bootstraps.</p>

        <p>It absolutely is. </p>
<p>It's being rage fueled by lifelong losers and chronic abject failures in life and enjoy everyone being forced to live their awful pathetic existence for once. And, instead of realizing they can improve their lives and don't have to be that pile of shit that they are -- or realizing it but not wanting to put in the work and hating everyone that has -- they would rather take the one opportunity they'll ever have in their lives of feeling like they matter instead of being the net-drain on society they actually are and just continue to revel in that daily glow of smugness they get by donning their douchebag decoration and walking out the door to go judge those that won't and laugh at those who've lost their livelihoods while the billionaires and elites they claim to loathe continue to advance the greatest theft of societal wealth we've ever lived through. </p>
<p>All at the permission of the scumbag vermin with twitter accounts and 0 purpose in life other than trying to sink everyone down to their sorry, useless, self-inflicted stations.</p>
<p>They're scumbag dumbfucks that revel in being scumbag hateful dumbfucks. A whole demographic of Milgram subjects that are walking around in a constantly aroused state over their daily dopamine drip of sadistically obsequious living. They fucking LOVE this shit.</p>

        <p>That's not all true. I know older people plugged into the news cycles who believe every word of it. They have comfy middle class jobs that telecommute, get paid for working fewer hours, and think they're in the middle of a dangerous pandemic despite not actually being in the adverse age range. It's everyday people with settled comfortable lives and an unfailing trust in the news who are the problem</p>

        <p>Dude you are way off, and your interpretation of people who actually suffer from depression conditions is disgusting. It is not depressed people who are perpetuating this, it is the entitled self centered egotistical overeducated fucks who hate themselves and everyone else, who are the ones responsible. </p>
<p>If you knew anything about mental health disorders, you would not be pointing the finger at people with depression. </p>
<p>I have worked plenty with people suffering from numerous conditions, and understanding the fine line between these conditions is crucial.</p>
<p>For instance the depressed narcissist, who is only exhibits depression becasue they are not getting what they feel they are entitled too..The condition you treat here is the narcissism, not the depression, because you can't treat the depression, its the symptom not the source. Whereas truly depressed people experience a sense of hopelessness, and the last thing they want is more hopelessness. They are not haters, in fact they tend to feel too much when it comes to empathy, sympathy, compassion and see the horrors and atrocities around the world at greater degree of amplitude then typical people. </p>
<p>People tend to confuse narcissistic symptoms with depressive symptoms becasue they can overlap.</p>

<p>If you understood narcissism and laws of human behavior, you'll know the former will lie about depression when it suits them.</p>
<p>You'd also know that as self-perceived stressors increase, so does narcissism.</p>

<p>Lying about depression is not the same as demonstrating the symptoms of depression AS I STATED lol...Very few people will admit any psychological disorder due to stereotyping and the perception of personal degradation.</p>
<p>Of course self perceived stressors will increase narcissism, but it does not create narcissism. You already need to posses and engrained sense of entitlement which is procured through genetics or developed through environmental influences and a narcissist will  certainly be more inclined to adopt self perceived stressors..</p>
<p>However, and being an expert and all, how did you manage to completely change the context of the argument..Surely, as a professional psychologist you would certainly not believe and endorse the accusation that depressives are the ones keeping this pandemic going. That is true depressives.</p>

        <p>Every day, I read something on this sub that I not only could not have said any better, but that I 100% agree with.  None of us will ever agree on everything, but, by God in Heaven, this pandemic is about something far more sinister than a damn virus.</p>

        <p>Actually, I disagree mostly not completely. It's being kept alive by mentally ill, but not depressives, these are what it's creating. Its being kept alive by overeducated egomaniacs, narcissist's, and sociopaths. I can't believe the volume of university level hypochondriacs that believe in this pandemic. Why?, because the indoctrination system has brainwashed them into not questioning anything, if the book says it, then it's gospel, despite the book being rewritten every year lol.. But then becasue they believe it, they feel righteous in flaunting their credentials as validation. "I have 4 degrees, therefore if i believe what they are telling us, it must be fact. </p>
<p>Although these people may also suffer from depressive characteristics, I believe it goes way deeper. Depression is more a feeling of hopelessness, and creating more hopelessness is typically not their goal. So, i believe this goes way deeper than depression as I stated above and is more in line with those who suffer from psychosis, a complete disconnect from reality.</p>

        <p>I think they're benefitting somehow from the hysteria. whether that is because they get to feel superior or because they got to stay home and collect a check thats more than if they had to work. or because they have cushy wfh jobs... </p>
<p>it is very rare that any of them have true concerns for others. </p>
<p>I have friends who are 80% anti lockdown who have elderly people in their lives and they take precautions to prevent their families from being affected. but they dont exhibit half the rabid fanaticism some of the covid crazies do. </p>
<p>So I know it is possible to care and take protective measures without losing your ever loving mind. That's why I conclude that the covid crazies must be benefitting off this in a way</p>

        <p>Indeed. This whole thing seems like a perfect storm a number of weirdo groups with some very bad motives.</p>
<p>Another notable group seems to be people that are immunocompromised or think they're immunocompromised (see also mentally ill depressives) or want to white-knight for the immunocompromised and all their efforts are not really in service of protecting the immunocompromised, but in punishing everyone else and trying to make everyone else feel their pain or hear their story or whatever the fuck. It's all so odd. On the plus side, if this keeps up, I'm sure we have a critical mass of normal people that can just move on without them -- maybe this will result in next-gen "White Flight". In that way, I think the end result of all this (and several related social developments of the past 50 years) will be a better world for normal people albeit after wasting so much time and money and effort these past 50 years trying to accommodate these defective people and a very, very extreme transition period. Of course a big drawback will be a much, much crueler world.</p>

        <p>Yup, that's exactly how it is, at least here in the US.  The restrictions are all an illusion, none of them are real laws, none of this holds up in court.  Literally all it would take to end the "pandemic" is a critical mass of people saying "fuck this" and not complying any more.</p>
<p>Instead, most people are ether propagating the fear, or reluctantly playing along, and businesses following the "rules" because they're afraid of being fined at a time when they're already losing money.</p>
<p>The people are in control.  Rules are coming from politicians, but remember that US politics is nothing more than a popularity contest.  Lockdown-crazed governors only continue piling on restrictions because <em>that's what their voters want</em>.</p>
