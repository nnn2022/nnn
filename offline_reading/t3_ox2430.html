    <strong>So I just started in new school in finland and masks are only "mandatory" when you are going to eat in schools restaurant they won't serve you food unless you are wearing a mask.</strong>
    <p><p>I haven't really used mask during this plandemic, now it was first day at school and I decided to only for this day wear that mask for lunch. My  throat immediately started to swell (maybe cheap china masks?) and I felt very fast lack of oxygen. I can't understand how people can wear those things all day. Positive thing is that no one in class is using masks not even teachers. </p>
<p>I just have to make my own lunches to shcool now, which is dissapointing because food would be free in our school.</p>
<p>Now I understand even better why it is very bad thing to make kids wear masks in schools, it is very sick practice when it doesn't even do anything against that virus and kids won't even get sick from covid. I'm 100% sure that they will get sick from wearing masks everyday for multiple hours after some time.</p></p>

        <p>Since the masks have usually been disinfected with ethylene oxide, which is highly toxic and you then inhale, a quick internet search will tell you why you shouldn't touch anything that was laced with EO (ethylene oxide).   </p>
<p>Interesting to note, all so called PCR test kits are laced with it. Anybody want to go for a poisonous test to be able to watch a movie at the cinema?</p>

        <p>I hate this argument I am not here to argue for mask mandates just to be clear. Long before Covid men on Building sites wore masks in rooms literally full of dust. I’ve worn them in work spaces where I can’t see the man 6ft infront of me for thick plaster dust. They clog in these types of situation and make it harder to breathe never in 14 years of work have I felt sick after wearing one. I’ve picked up the one covered in filth and dust from the day before and wore it again. The only argument needed should be that they don’t actually fucking work for viruses. The masks make you sick bullshit is so feeble minded. If you don’t want to wear one don’t. If it’s mentally affecting you then see a doctor.  Do not use the excuse that a mask is killing you if you’re a fit and healthy person.</p>

        <p>I've been working in nuclear power plant, in metal working factory and I've been in army.</p>
<p>I have worn almost all types of masks because of work or  against tear gas in army.</p>
<p>Yes I can work with mask on when it's necessary. And all the masks and filters have been very clean and with good safety certificates, and we get new filters every time we do the work. Yes I get very exhausted very fast when I wear mask with strong filters because lack of oxygen, and lack of oxygen causes stress and makes your immune system weaker, but I can work. When I used mask for metal working and cleaning reactor pool we used motored masks which pushed air trough the air filters so we could breathe easily,</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure those cheap china masks (which made my throat instantly swell) are making people sick, when they are wearing those all day. They don't get enough oxygen to their brain breathing trough that diaper if you make people use mask all day it should be something like this, <a href="https://lectussafety.com/en/products/1440-cleanair-chemical-2f">https://lectussafety.com/en/products/1440-cleanair-chemical-2f</a> so you can breather freely. And with right filters it would even prevent catching the virus if it even exists :D</p>
<p>PS. my friend told me who was making school test which lasts about 6hours, they had to wear masks all the time. He told me that it was almost impossible to concentrate because he couldn't breathe correctly and felt hypoxia, he was just getting dizzy.</p>
<p>edit: also I find this pretty interesting, sorry for finnish subs https://tokentube.net/v/1354532134/Katso-t%C3%A4m%C3%A4-ennen-kuin-k%C3%A4yt%C3%A4t-maskia----Rapsodia-fi--tekstitys</p>
