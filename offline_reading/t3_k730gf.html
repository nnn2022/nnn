    <strong>Falling Through the Cracks of the New Normal</strong>
    <p><p>Not sure if this the right type of post, but here it goes. Just like everyone else here, I have come to the conclusion that the coronavirus is overrated, that lockdowns do not work, that mask mandates do not work, and that a vaccine will not solve this pandemic. Unfortunately, there are people in this world that are being barred from society when they do not fit this new normal narrative. Sadly, I am one of those individuals. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I am on the autism, and one of the symptoms of this condition are tactile sensitivities to certain materials. Wearing metals, bracelets, clothes tags, and masks can raise anxiety and trigger panic attacks or psychological meltdowns. Another symptom is difficulty in recognizing facial features. Sadly, covering half of a person's face makes trying to recognizing what they are feeling is now even more difficult. Unfortunately, these maskholes do not understand that. There have been so many times where I have been denied access to a business because of my conditions. And if has now become frustrating and worrisome where I have to go into a store, worried if I am going to get harassed by an ignorant employee. And this is in an area where these mandates are not totally enforce. I can only imagine how people with medical conditions living in New York or California are being treated. It's disgusting and outright discrimination. It's like I am back in high school, only instead of not being allowed to sit at a lunch table, I am not allowed to buy ice cream. I can't go hang out with friends or family or go on dates because of this. Sadly, I am just one of millions, like a story I just read of a woman who was screamed to leave a dry cleaner store for not wearing a mask because she had PTSD, or a man who was denied buying a cup of coffee for his medical conditions. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sorry for this rant, but it has to said. We need to look at the bigger picture, but these unfortunate NPCs do not even see their own feet. I hope you all understand.</p></p>

        <p>I understand fully. This mask bullshit is ruining this world. Almost every state exempts individuals, like yourself, from wearing a mask, yet these businesses want to go "above and beyond," and be dickheads about it!</p>

        <p>I have on a couple occasions went into a store sans mask and have a person who was wearing one saw me and take off theirs. It is a great feeling. There are many people who do not want to wear one but they afraid of others.</p>

        <p>I agree with you, and also have some of the same issues.  It's terrible you and others are being denied service/access to places and that 99% of people don't seem to care at all.</p>

        <p>Hey, I’m also on the spectrum.  I’m recently diagnosed, and still figuring a lot of things out.  One thing I’ve known for a long time though is I have a hard time following people talking and seeing their mouth while they talk helps.  I get uncomfortable trying to listen to someone explain something on the phone, for example.</p>
<p>Lately I avoid shopping unless I can find a store where the clerks might not wear masks.  I feel, I dunno, like my hometown is suddenly a semi-hostile foreign city where I hardly speak the language.</p>
