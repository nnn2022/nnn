        <p>The scientific method has been dead for a long time, just no one was really paying attention.</p>
<p>One school in Australia, which basically owned a scientific field of study had their research duplicated and none of their results were reproducible.</p>
<p>Because they had essentially owned the field of study, they had peer reviewed each other and just kept promoting the false results...because they were getting funded and because the media liked the narrative that their research was producing.</p>
<p>The whole reason for "science" was to let the data have the say and remove the bias, but this only works in private research that isn't shared with the public and only done with the view in making a profit.</p>
<p>For example, if this polymer serves the needed function will be pretty damn sure. They will really test the shit out of it, but they aren't going to tell others their results.</p>
<p>But the "science" we are seeing is not this. In 1988, the government decided to fund the shit out of "climate change", but only one perspective of "climate change": manmade.</p>
<p>Funding for the subject increased 10 fold within a few years, but all funding the view that man is causing catastrophic climate change and the government should tax and control all human activity. After a few decades, you could no longer even join a post-graduate school unless you promoted this view, let alone graduate and get a job. They slowly got rid of any dissenters and only allowed their ideologues to become "experts". </p>
<p>If you look back at the original hypotheses of climate change and the data they used to come up with them, they've completely changed...and yet the final conclusion has stayed the same?</p>
<p>Covid is merely climate change sped up. When they realized: we can send private emails saying this data makes our case look bad and we should change the data. We then proceeded to change the data. And then our emails got leaked and everyone knew we intentionally changed the data...and nothing happened. Over a decade later and the same guys who got caught manipulating the data are still doing it at the same institutions that they had been doing it then.</p>
<p>This is where the problem comes in. They don't face any punishment and the people who worked to tell the people what is happening: the government is faking the data in order to reduce your ability to consume, to reduce your ability to reproduce, to reduce your ability to survive, they get ignored.</p>
<p>And then they escalate and we get covid.</p>
