    <strong>Why would anyone take the vaccine?</strong>
    <p><p>I‚Äôve been racking my brain to figure out why it would be in the best interest of anyone to take the vaccine and I can‚Äôt find any good reasons simply put. Here‚Äôs the thing, HIV has been around since 1959 and we don‚Äôt have a cure yet and I‚Äôm sure there are other similar diseases that don‚Äôt have a cure yet. This vaccine was rushed over a very short period of time, was not approved by the FDA and people are truly naive enough to think it‚Äôs safe? Why? 
When the Canadian government runs ads saying the vaccine is ‚Äúsafe and effective‚Äù I‚Äôm going to assume it‚Äôs unsafe and ineffective, because the Canadian government has not been correct about literally anything since coronavirus started. Our ‚Äúhealth doctors‚Äù clearly don‚Äôt have our best interests in mind. If they did they would be pushing for people to get sun everyday, exercise every day, take vitamin D supplements, eat good foods, etc. I haven‚Äôt seen any of those things being pushed, I haven‚Äôt seen our health officials ever recommend anything like that, but we are naive enough to believe they know wtf they are talking about? Why? </p>
<p>And this isn‚Äôt coming from this big anti Vax guy. To get a bit personal, I have an auto immune disease and have tried numerous different medications to tame it. Nothing worked until I was recommended this drug that was still in the trial period but seemed to be effective, I thought well anything to make the pain go away right? And the drug worked I‚Äôve been healthy ever since. </p>
<p>So to be clear this is coming from someone who willingly took a drug that was still in a trial period to alleviate pain that I was having. But it‚Äôs so totally different, we know the numbers. 99% survival rate unless you‚Äôre 65+ and the chances of even catching the damn thing have got to be under 10% right? </p>
<p>This is why it‚Äôs different, being willing to take an experimental unproved vaccine being pushed by the government that‚Äôs done nothing but make things horrible for everyone in the past year, why should I trust them? Not to mention the fact that none of these vaccine makers have any credibility and all have criminal records. And if all that wasn‚Äôt enough the fact that Bill Gates is tied to one of the vaccine companies makes it even more suspicious if you didn‚Äôt need to be pushed away more. </p>
<p>So why logically would you be willing to take a vaccine when the people who are pushing it have no credibility, the chances of you surviving the virus are 99% and we don‚Äôt even know the long term side effects of the vaccine? What if it makes you infertile? Are you willing to not be able to have babies to save yourself from that 1% chance of dying? If so, why? Are you willing to risk long term side effects that we don‚Äôt even know about yet for that 1% chance of dying? Why? </p>
<p>And if that is the case, why leave your house at all? What are the chances of you getting hit by a car? Are you walking around with a helmet? If no, why not? Why does this virus warrant potentially giving up some serious side effects over a 99% survival rate virus that you‚Äôll most likely be over in a few weeks? Why? </p>
<p>That‚Äôs my rant</p></p>

        <p>So do you mean people who ONLY got the vaccine to do that or people who got the vaccine and just also happened to do that independently? Because if its the first one I totally agree that counts as virtue signaling. Just trying to make sure I read this right lol</p>

        <p>If people just get the vaccine, then post about their experience for other people who might be interested in getting it or are on the fence, that‚Äôs fine and not virtue signaling.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm talking about people who are all smug about it, or have obnoxious ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù and ‚Äústay home save lives‚Äù frames on the profile pic, or post masked selfies (not talking about pictures where they happened to be doing something wearing a mask, but pictures emphasizing the mask, usually taken at home.)</p>
<p>Or people who make posts trying to strongarm other people into wearing a mask or getting the vaccine.</p>

        <p>So one of my friends had covid 2 weeks ago, she worked herself up so much she went to the hospital. Everytime they tested her blood ox levels they were normal, she insisted on staying and having oxygen, shes only 30. This is how brainwashed shes been.
They opened vac up to 30 and over last week, she got it the day it started. "I hate needles l, but hate covid more" god damn woman you have antibodies! The sheer level of fear she has is amazing. This is what were up against</p>

She believes in vaccines and believes in variants and shit, but she's not taking a chance with this vax. She says there aren't enough studies.</p>

        <p>There are people on this planet that still trust the media. I asked someone why they got it and why they think it‚Äôs important. They ‚Äúmulti source‚Äù what they read, those sources including NPR and Washington Post. They believe the vaccine is safer than COVID, and that 600K Americans have died from this disease. He also admits he doesn‚Äôt know one of those 600k people. He believes there‚Äôs refrigerated trucks of bodies in NYC and that dead Indians are piled up in the streets. He believes all of this but doesn‚Äôt believe the vaxed women with messed up periods have anything to worry about, or even exist. </p>
<p>Oh, and he also got it because he wants to travel. And buy a gallon of milk. These are his words. Should non vaxed people need to show ID to fucking Walmart employees to pay for food to eat, I ask. He says they can just wear a mask. Lol.</p>
<p>Who is this he I speak of? My massage client that I‚Äôve been seeing since May 2020. This. Shit. Is. Bananas.
But he‚Äôs no worse than the 41 year old woman I know that 1. Kept her mother from her children till she was vaxed. Gma has looked like shit since shot btw. 2. Had a miscarriage after her own vaccine. 3. Plans on vaxxing her under 12 year old kids. I wish I was lying.</p>
<p>People are dumb and obedient and simple minded. The way the world is set up, you can lead a happy healthy life as a complete fucking moron. We‚Äôre surrounded by people who don‚Äôt have to or want to think for themselves. It actually riles me up. Happily standing for fucking nothing and thinking you should make the rules for everyone else. Putting the false sense of security above all and shaming those that don‚Äôt fear as hard as you. Disgusting.</p>

        <p>Some just want to push their views on others. The whole thing is very political. But the media has also done a number on a great deal of people. They've been legit scared for the past year. They see the jab as relief and bliss. Those people don't have the most analytical minds, I would suggest.</p>

        <p>Look, I think Bill Gates is a monster, but in this speech? That‚Äôs not what he says. When he speaks about reducing population he is talking about reducing growth, and when he talks about ‚Äúreproductive services‚Äù he‚Äôs talking about birth control and stopping the poorest 15% of the world from having 10 kids, not destroying population growth with vaccines. How he says it is murky but he‚Äôs not threatening the current population.</p>

        <p>A lot of things in your post are unsubstantiated, but I'll ignore that for now. You say that it has a 99% survival rate. Even assuming that's true, it doesn't only kill you. Covid also can make it so you have to live on a ventilator for years, make you immunocompromised (a problem I'm certain you understand), take your sense of smell or taste away permanently (which I'm sure I don't have to tell you is dangerous), and it may even have more long term effects we don't yet know. Furthermore, a virus can mutate, and become way way more deadly if you let it run wild. Suddenly seems like more than just a minor flu, huh? Finally, and I shouldn't even have to say this, but why is it ok to just say fuck it and let old people die? How callous do you honestly have to be to let your grandma die because you didn't want a vaccine (with no proven side effects of any real threat) that costs you nothing but an hour of your time to get. There is little to no reason to avoid the vaccine. Think about it. Anyone you ask who's against the vaccine usually has some kind of alternative they want to sell you, or was against basic safety measures in the first place. Get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Edit: if you disagree with anything I say, feel free to msg me and we can have a discussion. I'd love to be corrected.</p>

        <p>Oh boy. Your question wasn't remotely in good faith I guess. Oh well, I'll discuss anyway in hopes you'll listen, or that at least someone will. This arguments pretty easily done away with anyway. Suicide rates were already on the rise, and even accounting for that all you have to do is compare the number of suicides beyond the yearly average to the total deaths from covid-19. I 100% guarantee that it's not even a fraction of covid deaths, even if you remove the old people from the death toll. Also, people may be committing suicide because people they know died because of the virus, ever think of that? My argument is perfectly logical, but if it isn't I'd like you to poke holes in it if you see any flaws. I'll respond accordingly. Finally, this had literally nothing to do with the vaccine. If suicides are related to lockdown then we can stop lockdown if we get the vaccine. This ain't complicated. Get the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Lockdowns make perfect sense if implemented correctly. Had it worked as intended in the US (oh, by the way, it worked just fine in most other countries when they tried it) it would have drastically reduced the spread of the virus (of which you claim was not nearly as infectious as people claimed, which is patently false and calls into question how much you ACTUALLY know about the virus) and help keep infections down and not overwhelm hospitals. We failed massively on this front due primarily to people, presumably, like you who ignored lockdowns and made covid (not Wuhan virus, no scientific institution I've heard of has referred to it as that) explode to all parts of the country. Now, if I've misrepresented you then I apologize and retract my comment about you being like them. Anyway, lets keep moving. You dare call me a wannabe dictator, which is laughable and a clear strawman you use in lieu of an actual argument. I wont reveal exactly where I am politically as I feel that would just clutter the conversation, but lets just say I'm almost as far from a dictator as possible. I don't believe the government should wield the powers of a dictator so easily (if at all) but lockdowns are NOT in any way dictatorial. It is a matter of public health, and it wasn't even enforced. Furthermore, if I WERE a dictator it wouldn't be in my best interest to enforce a lockdown as my biggest threat is the people rising up, and a lockdown wouldn't make my populace happy, would it? "Locking down healthy people is evil" Lets break that down. First of all, at the stage where we first implemented the lockdown we couldn't even functionally tell who was or wasn't infected as it can be asymptomatic for weeks and testing wasn't effective enough yet. Then, you claim its EVIL which is a completely subjective argument. Personally, I think refusing to take necessary actions against a global pandemic is far more evil than telling people not to go out for 2 weeks. And before you say lockdown was longer than that, NO SHIT. But that's because people didn't respect it, not because of some government plot for control. Overall, based on everything you've stated in your interactions I sincerely doubt you have any real knowledge on the virus that isn't from a severely biased institution. What are your sources? I can only assume they are poor ones seeing as you call it the Wuhan flu (its not even the flu, just look it up)</p>
<p>Still open to debate, but cut it with the strawman arguments. They'll get us absolutely nowhere.</p>
<p>Edit: still waiting on the reasons as to why the vaccine is bad for any reason and NOT THE SOLUTION TO YOUR PROBLEMS WITH LOCKDOWN</p>
