        <p>Not saying I wouldn’t be shocked if they got it sooner, just haven’t seen any proof. Plus there’s people like former president Trump in the US who quietly got it. Oddly, he had the a bad case of virus so it was somewhat shocking to me that he got the vax</p>

        <p>That’s not how this works. He claims to have gotten it, so the burden of responsibility is on those who deny that fact to provide supportive evidence, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Edit: yes, I am aware that Trump has a reputation for being a liar, but again, evidence is needed to dispute his claims. Sounds like you are just a Trump hater tbh</p>

<p>This makes absolutely no sense.  So if someone claims to have traveled to the center of the earth, you're saying the burden of responsibility is on those who deny that fact to provide supportive evidence, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Your thinking is completely backwards.</p>

        <p>I see your point. I suppose the evidence is that he (and presumably the WH doc claim he got the vaccine). Had anyone questioned him making this up? It would be an incredibly strange (even for him) thing to lie about</p>

        <p>Undoubtedly. Some due to new evidence. Some was intentional as was the case with lying about masks to preserve them for health workers. I think some of it (not saying I agree) is that some MDs perceive the general public as being to stupid to follow directions so they need to prod them in the right direction. Then again I watched people stock piling TP so who knows...</p>

        <p>No way our overlords’ main puppets get experimental “vaccines” made by cutthroat criminals. It’s an old publicity racket.</p>
<p>“But <strong>President Ford said “I’ll settle all this”,</strong> and he called a special news conference and in front of the whole of America <strong>rolled up his sleeve and had his shot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now there is no doubt he did not have swine flu vaccine. They would not have given it to him, no way!</strong> But then he invited all the news media people that were there to line up and have theirs. Only one man volunteered and he was the White House press secretary, the rest refused to have it. And of course the other part of the story, which is history now, is that people started to become ill or drop dead in the buildings where they had received their injections. There have been several huge settlements, I think they are still going on now, haven’t finally been settled yet. President Ford passed a special act in Congress so that you couldn’t sue the manufacturers of the vaccine, you had to sue through the government.”</p>

        <p>Kalokerinos was affiliated with Australian Vaccination Network, an anti-vaccination lobbyist group.</p>
<p>As a speaker for the group, Kalokerinos spread numerous conspiracy theories about vaccines, including that vaccines were used to spread HIV/AIDS in Nigeria as part of a deliberate genocide perpetrated by the World Health Organization and the Save The Children Fund, that they were used by the Australian government to kill a large number of Aboriginal Australians, and that the United States planned to exterminate criminals by encouraging them to get vaccinated. He has said that the deliberate mass killings perpetrated by the World Health Organization and the Save The Children Fund "put Hitler and Stalin in the shade".</p>
<p>None of these claims are supported by scientific evidence.</p>

        <p>Trump’s a lying conman and I doubt he got anything. </p>
<p>Also, Kalokerinos, Kary Mullis, Peter Duesberg, Strecker and many others were right about Fauci and Gallo. </p>
<p>Gallo was a fraud for starters.</p>
<p>“What ABC needs to do,” says Mullis, “is talk to Fauci and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CEFDA103DF932A05751C1A964958260.html">Gallo</a> and <a href="https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/">show that they’re assholes, which I could do in ten minutes.”</a></p>
<p>“Guys like Fauci get up there and start talking, and he doesn’t know anything really about anything, and I’d say that to his face. Nothing.</p>
<p>The man thinks you can take a blood sample and stick it in an electron microscope and if it’s got a virus in there, you will know it. He doesn’t understand electron microscopy and he doesn’t understand medicine. He should not be in a position like he’s in.”</p>
<p>“They’ve got a personal kind of agenda. They make up their own rules as they go. They change them when they want to, and smugly... like Tony Fauci does not mind going on television, in front of the people that pay his salary, and lie directly into the camera.”</p>

        <p>Duesberg’s legit. Certainly more than those frauds Fauci and Gallo. Funny how you sidestepped Gallo’s known corruption.</p>
<p>Mullis stated:</p>
<p>“I like and respect Peter Duesberg. I don't think he knows necessarily what causes AIDS; we have disagreements about that. <strong>But we're both certain about what doesn't cause AIDS.</strong></p>
<p>We have not been able to discover any good reasons why most of the people on earth believe that AIDS is a disease caused by a virus called HIV. <strong>There is simply no scientific evidence demonstrating that this is true.</strong></p>
<p>We have also not been able to discover why doctors prescribe a toxic drug called <strong>AZT (Zidovudine)</strong> to people who have no other complaint other than the fact that they have the presence of antibodies to HIV in their blood. In fact, <strong>we cannot understand why humans would take this drug for any reason.”</strong>
http://www.duesberg.com/viewpoints/kintro.html</p>
<p>Kary Mullis also stated:</p>
<p><strong>”People keep asking me, ‘You mean you don’t believe that HIV causes AIDS?’ And I say, ’Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant! I have no scientific evidence for it!’</strong> I might believe in God, and He could have told me in a dream that HIV causes AIDS. But I wouldn’t stand up in front of scientists and say, ‘I believe HIV causes AIDS because God told me.’ I’d say, ‘I have papers here in hand and experiments that have been done that can be demonstrated to others.’ It’s not what somebody believes, it’s experimental proof that counts. And <strong>neither Montagnier, Gallo, nor anyone else had published papers describing experiments which led to the conclusion that HIV probably caused AIDS.”</strong></p>
<p>Mullis even had the opportunity do ask <strong>Montagnier</strong> personally about a reference proving that HIV causes AIDS. But he couldn’t name one. “It was damned irritating,“ as <strong>Mullis reported. “If Montagnier didn’t know the answer, who the hell did?“</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/10/27/anthony-fauci-40-years-of-lies-from-azt-to-remdesivir/">Anthony Fauci: 40 Years of Lies From AZT to Remdesivir</a></p>
<p><strong>Mullis asks Dr. Luc Montagnier for a reference stating ‘HIV is the probable cause of AIDS.’</strong></p>
<p>“So, I didn’t get any more out of him, <strong>he (Montagnier) walked away after that. And the people standing around, by the way who were his colleagues there, looked at him thinking like he should come up with a better answer than that but he couldn’t and he just turned around and walked away.</strong> I really thought he’d have an answer.  I really did! I mean, that was my last... I was right at the edge of my faith in the system... but I thought Montagnier will know why he thinks HIV causes it and he will tell me, ‘it’s because of this study,’ you know? But he didn’t have that.  <strong>None of those guys have that and that’s why they’re so weird, you know?</strong> That’s why they don’t want to say... they don’t want people like me walking up and asking those kinds of questions and they’re willing to go to great lengths to prevent that. They’re out on a limb.  I wouldn’t want to be there with them.”

        <p>I don’t know who Gallo is, but regardless, Peter is a known crank and the fact that you believe him to be ‘legit’ proves you have no idea what you’re talking about.</p>
