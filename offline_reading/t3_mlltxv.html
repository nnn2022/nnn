        <p>&rt; By late January 2026, the WHO reported sustained transmission of SPARS in 42 countries across the globe. The disease proved to be particularly devastating in low-income countries where weak health systems, malnourishment, and co-infections greatly exacerbated the impacts of SPARS. In the United States, the situation was much less dire, but public concern about SPARS remained high. This anxiety resulted in extensive use of Kalocivir across the country and led many citizens to actively seek out medical attention for even minor SPARS-like symptoms. Though taxing for local hospitals and clinics, increased self-reporting of SPARS-like symptoms provided data that clarified certain epidemiological features of the disease. The CDC published analyses of this data, which indicated a much lower case fatality rate of 1.1%, compared to the initial 4.7% estimate. While this information was a relief to public health officials, it did little to quell public concern.</p>
<p>Tons of interesting simulation aspects on the pdf.  Some similar.  Some not so much.</p>

        <p>Encephalopathy or specifically autism?  I am on my phone now and will check later.</p>
<p>Alex Jones seem to have trouble saying it imo lol.  Or in his frenetic style just rushes through the word</p>
<p>https://www.webmd.com/brain/what-is-encephalopathy</p>
<p>Now, as an extension, we can all use our vaccine adjuvant addled brains to decide whether encephalopathy is code word for autism with regards to the war game...(if the document doesnt specifically use the word autism)</p>

        <p>I think one way to look at it is that encephalopathy can be used to refer to many different problems including autism. But autism is not referred to as simply encephalopathy.</p>

        <p>Here’s a personal example I have. This is not the only type of encephalopathy that exists.</p>
<p>A friend of mine had a physical injury during birth that caused brain swelling. It caused behavior and mental issues and he was diagnosed with encephalopathy.  </p>
<p>The symptoms and issues he had were completely unrelated to any type of autism.</p>

        <p>He also admitted in court I believe his parents were CIA. Burden of proof.... You prove that he's not, there's no end. There is no proof. Put aside the ego part of you that would be very hurt if you were duped, and tell yourself there is nothing wrong IF you come to that conclusion and forgive yourself. Then investigate with a totally open mind knowing that everything is gonna be just fine. That's a formula for looking into any hard truth in general, especially one that you think is just impossible that you don't have it right. Jones is one of the most glaringly obvious examples of controlled opposition and disinfo.</p>

        <p>Alex Jones is 100% a CIA agent. Glad to see someone calling it out, it couldn't be anymore obvious. He's meant to be disinfo and importantly to be a caricature of a truth seeker to the general populace to discredit "conspiracy theorists", etc.</p>

        <p>I don't think so because his Y2K broadcast consisted of baseless fearmongering.</p>
<p>Sure he has been right many times, more times than even a broken clock but he discredits all of us critical thinkers the same "it's just Q, not Q-anon" fan club members discredit everything they touch.</p>

        <p>Knowledge of the war game actually isnt fear mongering.</p>
<p>Its enlightening to know what the controllers of society are simulating, and the specifics therein.</p>
<p>Alex Jones presentation is fear mongering though</p>
<p>His presentation, style &amp; warped lens of the document is indeed a limited hangout and I suggest reading the PDF directly.  Dont let them domineer real information.</p>

        <p>I would agree that Jones put his own.. ugh, <em>spin</em> on it.. and it is fear based, as is the msm right now. What id say this DOES show us, is that those deciding what happens rn have the capacity for this.</p>

        <p>If we lived in a fair society this would be making headlines, sadly we are controlled by people like Bill Gates. The man who is behind the new world order</p>

        <p>Well I wouldn't say he is "the man behind the the NWO" but I think I know what you meant in general.</p>
<p>Interesting that his PR image has taken a bit of a dive lately. Still, I think there is more to it. Knowing Gates' history, I think I can safely say that he doesn't care what anyone thinks about him. He never really did. Any effort that shows he does care is serving some other motive and if anything it's more a matter of making people think he cares about his public himage. </p>
<p>If being accused of being a pedo in the media could somehow advance his plans, whatever they may be, in association with who and whatever groups/entities.. I don't think he would have an issue with that. I don't know what his end-game is but I do know that his family has had had a pretty cozy relationship with Rockefellers even prior to Frederick Lamont Gates (Bill Senior's grandfather, I think).</p>
<p>Anyway, the sad thing is if someone were to wipe BG off of the face of this planet (say, a group of benevolent UFO pilots), another would take his place. Take Soros for instance. Man is older than dog shit. There's already a women being touted as "the new/female George Soros."</p>
<p>Anyway, this it not to take away from the fact that Gates is a piece of shit. He advocates for policies that are allegedly to fix issues caused by his ilk. If climate change is so bad, tell your Rockefeller friends to make the sacrifices that they expect us to make.</p>

        <p>I’m hoping people share this and wake people up to their plan because they pretty much told us in this document what they are doing.  So share this please with anyone u care about and break it down.  Other than that it’s all bad news but I’m trying to be optimistic</p>
