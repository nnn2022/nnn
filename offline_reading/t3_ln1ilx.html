    <strong>The problem is midwits don't understand what evidence is, much less science. If they did we wouldn't be in this mess</strong>
    <p><p>Their understanding of it derives from media, rather than philosophy. They view it as very black and white. Which is why they literally believe that anyone that disagrees with them on anything is a crazy science-denier conspiracy theorist. It's much more nuanced and open to interpretation in most cases. But they don't understand this because to them it's as cut and dry as the scared pepper experiment they did in middle school. They'll say things like "The science is settled" "Science proves" And they rattle on about "muh consensus" cause they don't understand science. They believe that consensus matters more than the fact that in the case of climate change the predictions are almost always hilariously wrong.</p></p>

        <p>The scam is so obvious. Neil "Pokey" Ferguson's computer model that started it was basically "3 obese old people got something we named Covid19 and one of them died. I'll crunch the numbers and extrapolate the results and "OMFG!!! 2.7 BILLION PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE!!!"</p>
<p>The same computer modeling scam was employed by Michael "hockey shtick" Mann for glow bull warming as well. ....... "4 more tonnes of CO2 was pumped into the atmosphere this year than last and the average world temperature went up by .01 degree. If next year there's more CO2.....crunch crunch......OMFG THE WORLD WILL BE A FIREBALL IN 10 YEARS IF WE DON'T RETURN THE MASSES TO ABSOLUTE POVERTY!! WHO GIVES A F ABOUT THE SUN, THAT'S NOT IN MY MODEL PARAMETERS!!!"</p>
<p>What a sleazy scam!!</p>

        <p>Like Fauci, he was in on the AIDs scam too.</p>
<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Ferguson_(epidemiologist)</p>
<p><em>He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics in 1990 at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford and his Doctor of Philosophy degree in theoretical physics in 1994 at Linacre College, Oxford.[5][6] His doctoral research investigated interpolations from crystalline to dynamically triangulated random surfaces and was supervised by John Wheater.[1][2][7] It was there that he attended a lecture by Robert May on modelling the HIV epidemic, which together with the death of a friend's brother from AIDS, interested him in pursuing the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases.[8]</em></p>
<p>And knighted.</p>
<p><em>Ferguson was appointed an Officer of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2002 New Year Honours for his work modelling the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak.</em></p>

        <p>I remember back in June the NHS in the UK admitted that the models were severely flawed. People asked "so can we go back to normal?" </p>
<p>The government said "<em>noooohohohoooo!</em>"</p>
