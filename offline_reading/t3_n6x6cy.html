<p>Why?? If the majority of people have been vaccinated so if we really are returning to normal, why cancel all of these events? Unless of course they lied when they told people all they would need to do is get vaccinated and then things would return to normal. That is not going to happen. </p>
<p>Check this out, this was published today: </p>

<p>So, it looks like they are going to use the new India variant to lock us down again for god knows how long.</p></p>

        <p>Ridiculous. I am in the US and at this point the only events I'll prob be going to are speakeasy gatherings where you need a password and you have to buy a spot in advance and it's not publicly advertised. I'm aware of  a gathering like this of people who are like minded next week near me. It's all word of mouth. I live in the worst state in the US we now have a shitty vaccine passport to go to public gatherings. I am now a second class citizen. Gotta find my own community now. This is going to continue as long as people allow it. Most are even cheering it and asking for more control. They honestly think people are not aware of what they are doing with the constant moving of the goal posts and lies to incentivize obedience. People who are done with this shit are going to have to create a paralell polis now.</p>

        <p>It's for the purpose of economic destruction.  Lure businesses to lay out and overextend in anticipation of a blockbuster season then purposefully pull the rug out for under them.  I wouldn't be surpruised to see the same type of thing happen here in the States... just as summer starts.</p>
