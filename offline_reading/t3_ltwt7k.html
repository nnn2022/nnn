    <strong>Do you have any hope in normality returning? Not one of compromise - REAL life.</strong>
    <p><p>I went to a few bars last night. I don't drink but if I could get out of the house to hang out with a friend I'll do it. </p>
<p>The first one was fine, just wear a mask when you get up or use the bathroom.</p>
<p>The second one was a bit more mainstream and had the same rules, oddly less enforced though.</p>
<p>The third was hilarious. Total hole in the wall. Required masks to walk around but allowed smoking indoors which I had not seen in some time. Felt like a bar you'd walk into in GTA.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It would seem that even on the third bar which is known for being a lovable shithole - that even they freak out when you step 3 feet to the left with no masks on.... They don't want to lose their business, I get it.  </p>
<p>The point is that in my state (PA) I've yet to find anywhere that is 100% NORMAL. Against this. The people in there behave as though all is well and good which makes you a bit more relaxed, but when you look around you just know something is off.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The way I view it is this - States like mine, CA, NY, NJ, ect - They will all continue on this path and be the last in line to lift restrictions. Actually, they may NEVER lift mask mandates and double down by making life harder with limited entry to places if you aren't vaccinated.  </p>
<p>Other states that we are seeing revolt - Parts of Florida, Iowa, North / South Dakota - They will most likely slowly revert back to normal unless people from locked down states move and infect them with their politics as well.  </p>
<p>What do you think?</p></p>
