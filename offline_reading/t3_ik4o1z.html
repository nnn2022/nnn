    <strong>Why we won’t get back to normal unless we wear masks.</strong>
    <p><p>First off let me say that I don’t believe masks work at all. But I just had this conversation with a friend who is just as anti lockdown as I am. He is a business owner though and said that requiring people to wear masks makes people feel safe and people need to feel safe in order to get back to normal. They need to feel safe in order to go into his store. Half the people in there don’t wear it right and he doesn’t require them to but just having a “please wear a mask” sign and selling masks at the door makes people come in and spend money. </p>
<p>It’s all just an act. I work at a night club and we make people sign wavers, wear masks and I take their temperature with a temp thing that I know for a fact is inaccurate but it makes people feel safe so they come in. I mean everyone at a night club isn’t worried about Covid anyways but it’s just the point.</p>
<p>It’s annoying but I kind of understand why it’s being pushed. We all know deep down the masks don’t do a damn thing. They are for everyone else to “feel” safer.  I think that’s what they mean when they say the mask isn’t for you it’s for others lol! </p>
<p>Masks will disappear eventually but I’m no longer going to be so anti-mask anymore because now I get it. The US is traumatized and this is one of the only way to fix it. As much as I desperately want things to go back to normal, it’s not going to happen over night.</p></p>

        <p>If your precious masks work, even to "feel" safer, then the entire country should be opened back up. This idea that wearing something over your face is going to protect you from a microscopic pathogen is ludicrous. It's a control mechanism and device, and nothing more.</p>

        <p>Yea they need to open everything up and if wearing the dumb ass mask will get them to open shit then I guess it’s what I have to do. It’s clear as day that they aren’t going to just open stuff without making it seem like there was a legit reason to close it even though most people know the truth.</p>

        <p>I get what  you’re saying but it seems like the masks are making the hysteria worse. Also the government requiring face coverings or vaccines is part of the problem , not the way out of it.</p>

        <p>I understand but the way it is I honestly think this is the only way we can get out of this. The hysteria is too high and at least we can keep the economy going with masks. That’s my biggest concern is keeping my job and not going broke and I think this is the only way to do it now.</p>

        <p>I like your compassion! And I will keep it in my heart. </p>
<p>But I need to vent. </p>
<p>How about this time we quit coddling sheeple? How about this time we don't dumb down the entire population to kindergarten? What if businesses accepted more responsibility for their filthy air ducts, brain fogging odor concealers, and indoor airborn microparticulate? I tried wearing a mask in stores back in the nineties, and figured out in 20 minutes they were going to make me sicker than the supermarket soap aisle would. The problem isn't CV it is the fucking air at rear loading dock parking lots from dirty old trucks exhaust sucked through the building intakes, etc., etc. It has been the air, indoor air outdoor air, for centuries in some places. Yeah. Thanks. Deep breath!</p>

        <p>I get it. Let's solve one problem at a time. My issue is that people will continue to blame the whole pandemic on the one guy they see not wearing one. Iv only seen someone with out a mask in a grochery store maybe once or twice however I am in a mask mandated state. 
Iv only ever heard a couple people complain about masks but the amount of times iv heard people complaining about people complaining about not wearing masks is endless. We are doing our job but the dormers will never be satisfied.</p>

        <p>The thing is, people do wear masks. I live in Utah, where we haven't had a mask mandate. Yet every grocery store requires them, and pretty much everyone wears them. People for the most part wear masks when they are asked to.</p>

<p>Uh, no. Masks are here to stay forever and ever. And pretty soon, the rules will be stricter, you'll have to wear it inside your car, inside your house, even while eating and taking a shower.</p>
