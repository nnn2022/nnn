        <p>I love this statement:</p>
<p>"We've been worried for months but now it's real," Breed said Tuesday, KGO-TV <a href="https://abc7news.com/health/live-sf-mayor-gives-1st-covid-19-update-since-curfew/8415120/">reported</a>. "Our dangerous winter has arrived." </p>
<p>Huh!!1 wait COVID knows no seasons. Is she saying that COVID is indeed nothing more than an annual flu and we have been lied to lol...Was Brazil, Australia, India in the midst of a dangerous winter when they were struck. Just looking at monthly average temperatures around the globe, it's evident whether it's -40 or +40 COVID thrives (according to the narrative), therefore what makes winter anymore dangerous than summer, when actually more people are out and about in the summer and tend to isolate more by default in the the winter...This narrative can be so tough to keep up with lol.</p>

        <p>Actually, no. In the winter, most people congregate more with other people in indoor areas.</p>
<p>In the summer, they are in outdoor areas where CoVid-19 has a much harder time spreading.</p>
<p>So there is a reason why they are calling this the "Dark Winter"... that said it is an exaggeration since there is no excess death in this country this year anywhere in the world.</p>

        <p>For people not familiar with her family background, her brother is in prison for murder and robbery. He and his girlfriend robbed a Johnny Rockets then fled across the golden gate. While on the bridge he pushed her out into oncoming traffic and she was killed. </p>
<p>Prior to dying she said he did it. London tried to testify that he was home during the incident ( he was never caught on scene and fled) and provide an alibi. He was convicted.</p>
<p>Once mayor she attempted to use her power to get him released and wrote a letter on Mayor letterhead. </p>
<p>I don’t think having a troubled brother should ruin a sibling’s life, but she clearly perjured herself by making up the alibi and then years later tried to use her influence to get him out. </p>
<p>This is the person SF elected for mayor.</p>
