    <strong>Young people under the age of 18 have a 735% greater chance of requiring hospitalization from a bathroom injury than COVID</strong>
    <p><p>According to a CDC study that "used data from a nationally representative stratified probability sample of 62 hospital EDs in the United States, available from NEISS-AIP, which collects data on initial visits for all injuries treated in these EDs," young people from the ages of 15-24 present to emergency departments at a rate of 58.8 per 100,000 for treatment of injuries sustained from use of a bathroom. </p>
<p>Data for younger ages is not available, but one would assume that if it included young children that number might skew even higher.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the study acknowledges that not all serious injuries receive treatment, so many cases will go unreported. The rate I have provided could be seen as a conservative measure. </p>
<p>Source: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6022a1.htm?s_cid=mm6022a1_w </p>
<p>Also according to the CDC, "analysis of pediatric COVID-19 hospitalization data from 14 states found that the cumulative rate of COVID-19–associated hospitalization among children (ages 0-18) is 8.0 per 100,000 population." </p>
<p>Source: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932e3.htm </p>
<p>Since these rates are both per 100,000 people, we can divide 58.8 by 8, and we get a 7.35 times greater probability of a youth requiring hospitalization for bathroom injuries compared to COVID. </p>
<p>Acting like COVID is some horribly deadly threat to children is irrational behavior. It is just not a major danger to them. </p>
<p>If you do not live in constant fear of youth falling off the toilet or slipping in the shower, you should not live in fear of children catching COVID. </p>
<p>It is time for the "won't someone think of the children" argument to go the way of the dodo. </p>
<p>We don't sacrifice the proper socialization and development of young children to an unfounded fear that they might hurt themselves in the bathroom, and we should not sacrifice those for COVID either. </p>
<p>Vulnerable adults should take measures to protect themselves. It is not the responsibility of young children to protect infirm older individuals at the cost of their one chance at proper mental and social development. </p>
<p>They do not yet possess the cognitive capacity to recognize and appreciate the sacrifices they are being forced to make right now, as well as how they will affect them later in life.</p>
<p>It is high time to end these insane measures that are harming our children. We must end this madness.</p></p>

        <p>Based on the warcrimes I commit in the bathroom, I reckon my rates are higher. </p>
<p>Which is why everyone needs to stock extra toilet paper and put a first aid kit in your bathroom. /covidlogic</p>

        <p>This is what I don't understand. It is a fact that general health and thus immune function is the most reliable indicator of how sick you will get upon infection with the virus. The people who are getting gravely ill are elderly adults and younger adults with markedly poor immune function, often due to chronic disease. The vast majority of relatively healthy people with robust immune systems are extremely unlikely to develop anything more than mild symptoms, much less die alone on a ventilator. Why are we so aggressively insisting that young, active, healthy people get the vaccine? Why young children?</p>
<p>Making healthy choices and maintaining a resilient body is too much effort for us. We opt for something quick and easy so we can get right back to treating our bodies like dumpsters. If we took ACTUAL measures to preserve immunocompromised lives, the pharmaceuticals and food industry would collapse.</p>
<p>We, the government or the general public as a whole, do not give a fuck about health and we should stop acting like we do.</p>
