        <p>People still don’t seem to understand that you can literally have a non-replicating fragment of Covid DNA in your nose hairs, and that would cause you to test positive on a PCR test. Asymptomatic cases are 2020 newSpeak for false positives.</p>

        <p>And you're completely sure that all 3 million were COVID-related?  Not any terminal patients that also just happened to have Covid too?  No healthcare workers told to mark down Covid on an uninsured patient's paperwork, because the gov't was covering all costs if Covid related?  Just some food for thought.</p>

        <p>You’re gonna be hard pressed to find people that don’t think covid exists. You’re in the central hive if you wanna find people that think covid exists but is literally just a slightly worse strain of the yearly flu. You can call people here stupid if it makes you feel better, but most of the people here are critically thinking and using their brains with the evidence that is being presented and suppressed. Government has fudged the numbers extraordinarily on this virus to dial up fear. Hospitals HAVE been paid more to mark a death as covid. As someone else posted, at least 1/4 of the UK deaths were just admitted to be misattributed to covid. CDC quietly admitted 94% of the deaths in the US had a comorbidity. These numbers will continue to be corrected.  </p>
<p>This is not the next black plague. You have been lied to and you have swallowed everything they’ve force fed you. If the moving goal posts and continual lies that are walked back on hasn’t woken you up at this point then I don’t know what to tell you. Continue to live your life in fear and submission.</p>

        <p>A UK study conducted by UCL found that at least 1/4 of 'deaths' had nothing to do with COVID at all. Coupled with a known unreliable test, it is hugely unscientific to state a figure even close to 3 million.</p>

        <p>And the complete absence of flu was due to wearing masks? Incidences in Asia (where a lot of the rounds happen for H1N1, SARS (original version), show that flu is still prevalent. For some odd reason, this time the flu just “disappeared”. If you have at least somewhat of an understanding of epidemiology, biology, and statistics, economics, and political science, this would seem somewhat suspicious. There’s both economic and political reasons for this, as well as national security concerns - pay attention to what’s happening behind the sciences (with various other countries flexing their governmental/authoritarian muscles, consolidation of economic control by various companies, and movement of troops by various entities).</p>

        <p>&rt; Over 3 millions deaths in the whole world</p>
<p>Bullshit.</p>
<p>The numbers have been inflated outrageously all across the western world to the point of being absolutely useless propaganda.</p>

<p>It is utterly absurd to call anyone who dies for ANY REASON within 28 days of a positive test a victim of the virus, but hospitals receive FAT PAYMENTS FOR "COVID" DIAGNOSES, AND EVEN FATTER PAYMENTS FOR "COVID" HOSPITALIZATIONS.</p>
<p>If the same criteria were used every year to judge "cold and flu deaths" it would appear that the Black Plague had returned each winter. </p>
<p>Furthermore, even with all the blatant stat-padding, the average age of a "Covid death" just happens to be <em>EXACTLY THE SAME AS LIFE EXPECTANCY.</em></p>
<p>That means that this virus, like many other coronaviruses and flu viruses, amounts to what is called a harvesting event.</p>
<p>The people supposedly dying from this are either 1) totally miscategorized and died from something completely unrelated, or 2) on the verge of death already, and will be claimed by the first illness that comes along, just like every winter.</p>
