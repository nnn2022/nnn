    <strong>So many being brainwashed and don’t even realize it...</strong>
    <p><p>It’s incredible what a little fear-mongering can do, isn’t it?</p>
<p>There’s been a problem brewing in the world for decades. Government surveillance has been spreading and covering more and more of our public (and private) spaces by the minute. And here we get the chance of a lifetime, to normalize wearing masks in public and regain our privacy. And some thinktank comes up with all kinds of conspiracy theories to make people think they’re standing up for their freedoms by not wearing one. The brainwashing is so effective that people who travelled to DC for “a revolution” refused to cover their faces while committing multiple crimes in front of cameras. Now they’re getting picked off by the FBI like so many flies. </p>
<p>Newsflash, the government doesn’t need to test citizens for obedience. They have cops to arrest people who disobey the law already. They don’t give a shit about any of us. They’re just gonna let us keep playing COVID Russian roulette as long as their billionaire donors are still making money. I’m really sorry that so many people in this sub are going to have to lose loved ones before they take the pandemic seriously. Life teaches the hard way sometimes.</p></p>

        <p>Your pretzel logic is astounding.  You think facial recognition needs a full face?  You think people went to DC to overthrow a government rather than maintain one?  You think it was Trump supporters who committed the majority of crimes?  You think wearing a mask and blindly obeying unconstitutional, liberty-restricting mandates is freedom?  </p>
<p>People die every day, sport.  Life is 100% fatal.  Rational people used to understand that, and make a personal risk calculation for any activity they undertook.  But then the media told you life was unsafe, and it was the government's responsibility to protect you from a virus, and you believed it.</p>
<p>Leave the Matrix, sheeple.  While you can.</p>

        <p>Masks only help train the facial recognition that is what they say.</p>
<p>Masks normalize forced medical interventions, they have softened the public for vaccine passports...it's basically forced drugs, or at least coerced. So I dont consider them an opportunity.</p>
<p>Cops cannot enforce all laws. They require the public to police such laws, that's what the masks are for. Look at how people have become fanatical about them. Its social enforcement.</p>

        <p>“Forced medical intervention”, it’s a piece of cloth on your face.</p>
<p>Can I assume, since you’re so strongly opposed to the government “forcing” us to wear masks, that you’re also opposed to the government forcing women to give birth against their will? It would at least be consistent.</p>

        <p>I got the term from a research paper I was reading. Perhaps you can judge if it's appropriate:</p>
<p>&rt; In medical research, the only scientifically valid way to test a medical intervention, such as wearing a face mask or prescribing any preventative treatment, is to use the universally accepted comparative study (e.g., face mask versus no face mask) specifically designed to remove selection and observational bias from the study. This is called a “randomized controlled trial” (RCT)</p>
<p>I have for a long time been on the side of choice. But I'm not sure the pro life position is quite the same as the literal physical violation of someone's body (like with a vaccine). </p>
<p>The mask is not physically forced but it has the appearance of being forced under law and financial punishment. There are other forces contributing too. I'm not opposed to force, it depends what the purpose is, the context and what the consequences are: a totalitarian mindset in the public and further violations of our rights. You guys always say "it's just a piece of cloth". You could also say an advertisement is "just a video". That is a child's view. In fact it is the utilization of subtle behavioural psychology to sell you a product.</p>
