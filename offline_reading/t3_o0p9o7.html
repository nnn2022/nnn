    <strong>Perhaps off-topic, but I think we are worried about the wrong book.</strong>
    <p><p>Since this nonsense has started people have been talking about Orwell's "1984" as if that is the end goal.</p>
<p>In some ways I can understand, but I think I've found a better example, and warning, of what is going on. And it includes more than just the "pandemic".</p>
<p>Now I have no doubt some will disagree, others will try to say it's BS without giving a reason, and others will use the author to discredit the story.</p>
<p>But I'm seeing similarities with characters, opinions, and attitudes of the story. Not the author, just the story.</p>
<p>"Atlas Shrugged" by Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>If all you've ever read is the Cliff Notes, or watched/listened to an opinion piece on the book I would ask that you read the book (or listen to the audiobook, read by Christopher Hurt is my preference). </p>
<p>You don't have to agree with the author, but I feel you should listen and understand the story.</p></p>

        <p>Rand’s warning has been loud and clear for more than a half-century. She was writing essays like “establishing the establishment” and “Censorship: Local and Express” back when the mainstream, now neocons and progressive hippies, were pretending to be enlightened. </p>
<p>Hopefully I’m early enough in the comment thread to welcome all the Ad Hominem attacks that are to follow. People love to hate Rand. If you’re recently woke and you’ve never actually read her, now is a good time.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah. I totally expect the attacks to come swiftly...</p>
<p>I disagree with certain things in Objectivism and Rand's philosophy, but I had decided to start listening to the book again and in the first chapters I was reminded of some of the BS and "loose languages" being used around COVID and other things.</p>

        <p>In College I was part of a book club. "The Fountainhead" was my pick. I'm in Canada surrounded by socialist fucktards, keep in mind. One guy didn't show to the meeting but made sure to let us all know via email how he could only make it through 100 pages before tiring of the infantile selfishness of AR. Just woke virtue signalling idiocy. Turns out he wasn't even reading the book I chose (he was reading Atlas Shrugged...... ok...)</p>
<p>They don't engage in good faith dialogue. They are much too diverse and compassionate for thay.</p>
