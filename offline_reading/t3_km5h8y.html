        <p>The lockdowns are already lasting very long. 2021 should be a return to normalcy like what mid-2020 was supposed to be. I swear if the Covid-19 pandemic somehow lasts longer than the 1918 pandemic (which lasted for two years and two months), it's going to be made a lot more clear that the government is more at fault for prolonging the pandemic (in my eyes, they're at fault but more and more people are only going to wake up from this madness as time goes on).</p>

        <p>We should have had a return to normalcy already... like 6 months ago already.</p>
<p>When it was realized that the vast majority of those dying from CoVid-19 were very old, had multiple pages of seriously pre-existing conditions, and/or were fatally Vit. D, Vit. C and Zinc depleted we should have immediately done a public health program that sent supplements for those three things to people and ended the masking and lockdowns.</p>
<p>Which by the way, Florida shows that the masking and lockdowns might actually be extending the wrath of this virus and making it worse as people who were immune to it get to the end of that 6 month at worst immunity window and catch it again!</p>

        <p>People didn’t take as many precautions with the 1918 Spanish flu. And the death rate for the Spanish Flu is greater THAN THE DEATH RATE OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR! Maybe perhaps part of the reason why Covid’s death rate has been pretty low is because of the precautions people have taken. Just a thought.</p>

        <p>No it’s because the survival rate is about 99.97% and is generally only deadly towards the elderly with comorbidities while the Spanish Flu killed a significant amount of children and young adults. </p>
<p>But ok.</p>

        <p>You don’t think access to medical care helps people survive COVID? It does. With the Spanish flu people didn’t take anywhere near as many precautions and look what happened, hospitals were overwhelmed. Perhaps you’re whining about having to take precautions is ridiculous.</p>

        <p>Spanish flu wiped out over 5% of the population, covid wiped out far less than 1%. And considering evidence being against asymptomatic spread, lockdowns, masks, and all that, could our measures really be responsible for that? Look at the places with less precautions, have they lost that many people?</p>

        <p>I like how you riggle raggle with the death toll of Spanish flu. Here’s a thought, one was two too many. Raggling with death tolls is also a strategy used by Holocaust deniers. FOOLISHNESS! Also where is your evidence against lockdowns and masks slowing the spread of the virus. Show it to me, assuming that you can.</p>
