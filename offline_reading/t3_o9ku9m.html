    <strong>The pull of conformity</strong>
    <p><p>Hey everyone, (long text sry) first off I want to say how much I appreciate this sub and how many likeminded people are able to get together. NNN has been a beacon of hope for me.</p>
<p>Despite that, it gets really lonely to live at the ‚Äùtip of the spear‚Äù. In my country they are introducing the vaccine no to ppl over 25 yo (I am 26). </p>
<p>Everyone I know is getting the vaccine and no one questions the motives of the mainstream media and the government. It‚Äôs so hard because I have no one to talk to and discuss the recent events because everyone will just regard you as an ‚Äùidiot‚Äù for speaking against what everyone sheepishly follows.</p>
<p>I have had thoughts like ‚Äùhell, I should just get the vaccine because everyone else is getting it‚Äù, or ‚Äùmaybe I am just being paranoid because no one questions anything‚Äù, hence my title. I quickly brush those thoughts off though as being nothing more than feeling a sense of security.</p>
<p>My question is if you guys feel the same way, and how do you stay on the path? Do you have any tips on how to remain steadfast in your beliefs about the government and the MSM having ill intent when you feel doubtful? When your are alone in your whole social circle?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading and I am looking forward to your answers.</p></p>

        <p>I think a lot of people are at least somewhat alone in their social or family circles now.  We are lucky enough to live in an area where there are many many like minded people but even still there are so many people that we know or see when out that are part of the matrix that it's pretty depressing sometimes.</p>
<p>Just know that you aren't alone and there's at least 80k+ people on here which you can bullshit with at any given time!  </p>
<p>I think what keeps most of us going is that it seems like every day a news story breaks that confirms something we had already been warning about for months or years about all of this.</p>

        <p>How I remind myself not to gaslight myself is I look at the pictures and videos of the vaccine injured. There are people with horrific skin conditions covering their whole bodies, their entire legs covered in bloody blisters, skin peeling, head to toe eczema, people who's bodies can't stop twitching, convulsing, shaking, people who have lost the use of their legs, can no longer walk, can't function, can't take care of themselves, can't work, can't drive. Then there are the people who end up with strokes, brain hemorrhages, blood clots in their legs and lungs and just the other day I saw a woman had lost her vision. Then I remind myself of the mass amounts of women who've had their cycles disrupted, who can't get pregnant and who are losing the babies in the middle of their pregnancies. </p>
<p>And then there are the dead.. not just the elderly or middle aged out of shape adults. 22, 19,13...  children. </p>
<p>And I remind myself that the WEF, Schwab and Gates and all their fucking cronies have their goal of reducing the human population and creating an enslaved class of serfs and a class of elites. </p>
<p>And I feel terrible about what's going on in the world but I feel better about my being awake and aware. It means I'm one step ahead of their disgusting game.</p>
