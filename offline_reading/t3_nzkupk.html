    <strong>"Experts" are pushing a new wave of COVID fearmongering over the Indian "Delta" variant. Here are the facts:</strong>
    <p><p>Bob Wachter is a major media "COVID expert" who makes tv appearances and writes Op-eds that get published in places like the Washington Post. He is leading the charge on a new round of fearmongering right as COVID remains in a steep and steady decline in the United States. In this post I will be refuting these "experts".</p>
<p><strong>I. The experts have been consistently wrong in their predictions and models, always erring on the side of fear and hysteria</strong></p>
<p>&rt;FEBRUARY 17, 2021: One month ago, the CDC published the results of more than 20 pandemic forecasting models. Most projected that COVID-19 cases would continue to grow through February, or at least plateau. Instead, COVID-19 is in retreat in America. New daily cases have plunged, and hospitalizations are down almost 50 percent in the past month. </p>
<p>&rt;JUNE 07, 2021: On May 12, the CDC published this composite of models predicting how the next several weeks of the pandemic would go. Most correctly anticipated that infections would continue to decline as vaccinations increased (although one model expected a surge back to 500,000 cases per week!) but <strong>the average of the models expected</strong> that we’d dip to around 200,000 weekly cases, or <strong>28,600 cases daily.</strong> The <strong>actual seven-day average is … 13,927 cases, a little less than half of the models’ collective best guess.</strong></p>
<p>There is a pervasive bias within the scientific community to exaggerate the dangers of COVID. This is at least in part driven by liberal politics and related collectivist attitudes wherein these "experts" feel justified in lying and exaggerating and misleading in order to manipulate people through fear into doing what they see as "the right thing". Obviously, I don't agree. I think truth and honesty are paramount, and that people ought to have the right to decide for themselves. I think the credibility of the scientific community should be paramount, and I think the scientists who are sacrificing this credibility to scare people are a danger to public health. And Bob Wachter is among the worst. Now on to his tweets:</p>
<p><strong>II. Bob Watchter is fearmongering over the Indian "Delta" variant.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;@Bob_Wachter 1/ I know everybody’s sick of playing 3-dimensional Covid chess. Sorry, but the Delta variant forces us back to the chess board. Ergo, this Thread. If you’re fully vaxxed, I wouldn’t be too worried, especially if you’re in a highly vaxxed region.</p>
<p>&rt;2/ <strong>If you’re not vaccinated: I’d be afraid. Maybe even very afraid.</strong> Why? Let’s start with the things that we know about the current situation, then layer in new information about the Delta (aka, Indian) variant, B.1.617.2 Then we’ll end with what I’d suggest you, and we, do.</p>
<p>This isn't the 1st fearmonger I've seen about the Indian variant aka Delta, so I knew exactly what to expect. I also knew that his "what we know" &amp; "new information" section would not, in fact, be based on "what we know", and would instead be based on speculation. And we all know what his advice will be, since the whole point of his propaganda is to scare people into vaccination, so yeah, obviously "get vaccinated". </p>
<p><strong>III. COVID has been defeated, yet these "experts" refuse to take the win and move on.</strong></p>
<p>&rt;3/ Current U.S. situation is good. Cases, hospitalizations, &amp; deaths are falling fast, largely due to our fabulous vaccines. In SF – w/ 70% of people aged &rt;12 fully vaxxed – we’re nearly in a post-Covid world. Everybody’s opening up, including (on Tues) CA. That’s fine…for now.</p>
<p>He is correct that COVID has been defeated and is basically over. As of June 13, 2021, we are down to 13,304 daily cases, and 371 deaths. 5/13 was 627 deaths. 3/13 we had 1,306 deaths. 1/13 we had 3,469 deaths. The death rate has fallen by about 90% from its peak, and has shown a consistent and steady decline. This is the result of a combination of vaccination &amp; natural immunity. The "experts" consistently act as though absolutely no one has natural immunity, or that natural immunity does not exist. In fact <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210208/New-machine-learning-algorithm-estimates-number-of-COVID-19-cases-in-the-US.aspx">the likely range of natural immunity in the US is 25-30%</a>. </p>
<p>A normal person would cheer and celebrate. Comparing COVID to World War 2, if COVID were Japan, they might not have formally surrendered yet, but they've been nuked twice already and it's just a matter of time. Acting like they would or could come roaring back is the height of irresponsibility, but that's exactly what this "expert" is setting himself up to do:</p>
<p><strong>IV. Vaccinating kids who are unaffected by COVID doesn't matter. Vaccinating people at actual risk is what matters, and 86.7% of 65+ have been vaccinated.</strong> </p>
<p>&rt;4/ Sadly, ~50% of the U.S. (&rt;age 12) remains unvaccinated, and in certain states (mostly southern &amp; right-leaning), it’s more like 2/3rds. We know that a small # of vaccinated people will get breakthru infections, but they’ll rarely get very sick &amp; will almost never die of Covid.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We know that COVID is effectively harmless for people age 0-29: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33289900/">"The estimated age-specific IFR is very low for children and younger adults (e.g., 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25)"</a> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is only seniors age 65+ who face a major risk from COVID, so how successful has vaccination been in that group? Very. <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations">86.7% of 65+ have been vaccinated as of June 12.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wachter is dishonest in using statistics looking at ages 13+ and proclaiming only 50% vaccination, when most of that group is at near-zero risk, equal to or less than the seasonal flu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about that 13.3% of unvaccinated seniors? Shouldn't we take great pains to protect them? No. They made their choice. People make bad health choices all the time. People smoke. People destroy their livers with alcohol abuse. People stuff their fat mouths until they are morbidly obese. The freedom to make choices, includes the freedom to make bad choices, as long as you're not hurting someone else. This idea of individual freedom and choice directly conflicts with liberal collectivism. Liberals are arrogant enough to presume that they know what all the right and wrong choices are, and they want to take away your freedom to make what they see as "wrong" choices. The problem is that liberals aren't perfect, and they don't know better than you do what your best choices are. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>V. Wachter misleads to portray unvaccinated as at higher risk</strong></p>
<p>&rt;5/ Unvaccinated people remain at high risk of getting Covid... if they’re exposed to it. In April, I argued @washingtonpost that this is the most dangerous time for unvaccinated people (without prior Covid), since their bodies are no better …</p>
<p>&rt;6/ …at fighting the virus than they were in 2019, &amp; the virus they’re likely to see (back then, it was Alpha [UK] variant) is better at infecting people. But unvaxxed folks had 2 advantages: 1) they tend to be younger, so less likely to get sick, &amp; 2) they were less likely…</p>
<p>&rt;7/ …to be exposed to virus since community rates had fallen so much (due to kindness of vaccinated strangers). This remains true, which is why unvaxxed may well do OK for a while, probably through summer.  But fall/winter now scares me a lot, much more than it did 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>This isn't the most dangerous time. It's the safest, and only getting safer for everyone. But since he made his arguments in his WaPo Op-ed, I'll refute them point by point:</p>
<p>&rt;But here’s the bad news: Life has become even riskier for unvaccinated people, particularly those who have never had covid-19. (People with prior infections fall into a middle category, since they are at least partly protected but still require vaccination to increase the level and durability of immunity.)</p>
<p>Wrong. Natural immunity is superior to vaccination. Vaccination only attempts to mimic natural immunity, which the mRNA vaccines do VERY well, but many other vaccines, such as the Chinese vaccines, do very poorly. <a href="https://archive.is/aGOaK">Chile is in lockdowns with a massive outbreak despite most of the population being vaccinated, because Chile relied on the shoddy Chinese vaccine.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/opinion/2021/05/27/rand-paul-says-people-natural-covid-immunity-should-skip-vaccine/7468051002/">Senator and doctor Rand Paul published an extensively cited Op-ed refuting the insane and non-scientific notion - pushed by liberal fearmongers - that natural immunity is somehow inferior to vaccination.</a> The science stands with Rand Paul, and against fearmonger liberal academics like Wachter.</p>
<p>&rt;The reasons that the unvaccinated are at higher risk are biological, behavioral and political.</p>
<p>&rt;Let’s start with the biological. The human body has not evolved to be any better at fighting the novel coronavirus... But while humans haven’t evolved, the virus surely has. The B.1.1.7 variant, first reported in Britain, is now the most prevalent form of the virus in the United States. This variant is far better at its job than the original coronavirus in two crucial ways: It’s about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7003e2.htm">50 percent more transmissible</a> and, for someone who catches it, <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/more-data-suggests-uk-covid-19-strain-is-deadlier-than-other-strains/">up to 60 percent more likely to be serious.</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He is wrong that we have any evidence that Delta is more transmissible or infectious. Thankfully, he provided a link so we can see exactly what his source says. Clicking through, here is what it says: "Initial B.1.1.7 prevalence is assumed to be 0.5% among all infections and <strong>B.1.1.7 is assumed to be 50% more transmissible than current variants.</strong>" So the source openly states that it is a baseless assumption, without any basis in evidence, and Wachter just repeats this as fact. Elsewhere in the source, it states "However, after B.1.1.7 becomes the dominant variant, its transmission was substantially reduced." So there is no evidence Delta has higher transmissibility, and even if it does, that's temporary. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He also claims Delta is "up to 60 more likely more likely to be serious", whatever that means. His source is nothing more than a statistical analysis of COVID deaths in the UK. It's not medical, and it's not science. The study admits it is working with wildly incomplete and unrepresentative data: "Notably, our study is limited to individuals tested in the community. Indicators for infection with the B.1.1.7 variant are not currently available for most people who die from COVID-19 in England, as they are tested in the hospital rather than in the community and hospitals do not routinely collect genotypic data." so it is worthless. The study also admits there is no medical basis for Delta to be deadlier: "We do not identify any mechanism for the increased mortality here." Correlation is not causation, and with wildly incomplete data, there is no correlation, either. It's important to understand that if this "study" came out the opposite way, it would be dismissed. It's only because it produced an answer useful to the fearmongers that it is wrongfully accepted as fact.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;While treatments for covid-19 have improved somewhat since early 2020, the chances of hospitalization and death after a covid infection have not gone down much.</p>
<p>Wrong. "Two large recent studies show that people hospitalized for COVID-19 in March were more than three times as likely to die as people hospitalized for COVID–19 in August. The first study used data from three hospitals in New York City. <a href="https://archive.is/UMwBl">The chance of death for someone hospitalized for the coronavirus in those hospitals dropped from an adjusted 25.6% in March to 7.6% in August.</a> The second study, which looked at survival rates in England, found a similar improvement."</p>
<p>&rt;Then there’s the matter of human behavior: As more of the population is vaccinated, case rates, hospitalizations and deaths are likely to fall ... Seeing these numbers, unvaccinated people might well conclude that things have become safer and let down their guard.</p>
<p>Again, this only has to do with the risk of getting infected, not how severe that infection will be, but the data shows that all the "fearful" people are already vaccinated, and all the non-fearful people ran out of fucks to give months ago, so no, their behavior isn't changing now.</p>
<p>&rt;The inclination to act on sunny but partly misleading news will also influence political leaders. </p>
<p>The only misleading person here is Wachter and his fearmonger ilk.</p>
<p><strong>VI. Wachter exaggerates Delta to scare people</strong></p>
<p>&rt;8/ Reason: Delta. ...</p>
<p>&rt;11/ Why is Delta scarier? First, it appears to be even more infectious than the Alpha variant, probably by a similar amount (~40% more infectious than Alpha.)(h/t @EricTopol for @BBC table below) This means the same exposure that a person might have had last year is now about…</p>
<p>&rt;12/ …twice as likely to result in Covid. Second, it's looking like it is more serious, though we need more data to be sure. </p>
<p>These points were already refuted, above.</p>
<p><strong>VII. Wachter argues that Delta is able to overcome the vaccines, in order to scare people into getting vaccinated</strong></p>
<p>&rt;Third – and this is the big one – it does appear to be somewhat immune resistant. Before getting too freaked out about this, it’s worth noting that the…</p>
<p>&rt;13/ …data are reassuring, in a way: the efficacy of 2-doses of Pfizer is 88%, only a smidge lower than the 95% we’re used to, and still great. But the first dose data is concerning. Normally, a few weeks after dose 1, you’re about 80% protected (this was the argument for…</p>
<p>&rt;14/ …delaying 2nd doses when jabs were scarce). But for Delta, Pfizer dose 1 is only ~33% protective. https://gov.uk/government/news/vaccines-highly-effective-against-b-1-617-2-variant-after-2-doses This creates 2 problems: 1) People stay vulnerable until after shot 2 (&amp; many let guard down earlier); 2) Loss in efficacy for dose 1 points to some…</p>
<p>&rt;15/ …degree of vaccine/immune escape. And – though this isn’t proven – I’d worry that a fully vaccinated elder, or someone whose immunity stems from an infection &rt;12 mths ago, won’t be sufficiently protected over time, if immunity falls below a threshold needed to thwart Delta.</p>
<p>Liberals hate that vaccines are 99%+ effective, because as I have pointed out from the start: this utterly refutes collectivism: Since vaccination is so effective, you don't have the right to boss everyone else around anymore and insist they restructure their lives around your fears. Are you afraid? Get vaccinated, then shut the fuck up. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kotakuinaction2/comments/nqbtcs/black_dude_just_assaulted_me_at_the_gym_because/">I recently had an experience with some of these lunatics at the gym.</a></p>
<p>So in order to scare people into getting vaccinated, Wachter ironically has to shit on the vaccines and claim they aren't effective against Delta.</p>
<p>This is, of course, wrong. There is no medical reason to believe the vaccines are any less effective against Delta. Delta's spike protein works the same way, and still uses the ACE2 receptor, which is what all the mRNA vaccines target. You should have great mistrust of "studies" coming out of the UK, since they have been in full hype, hysteria, and fearmonger mode. </p>
<p><strong>VIII. Wachter's "advice": masks forever, lockdown forever</strong></p>
<p>&rt;16/ What to do? For a vaccinated person... <strong>indoor mask wearing (if you’ve stopped; BTW, I haven’t)</strong> in places w/ unvaxxed/unmasked folks.  If you’re unvaxxed, get your shots! </p>
<p>&rt;For me, Delta adds to my resolve to keep mask on indoors when unvaxxed/unmasked people may be around. And I'm getting… 25/ …psychologically prepped for some <strong>restrictions to return in fall</strong> (tho highly vaxxed places like SF will likely do fine). Nobody wants that, but the virus doesn’t care what we want. For unvaxxed, I wish you well but my sympathy is flagging. Your bad choice is looking worse.</p>
<p>Pathetic</p>
<p>&rt;18/ As you can see, Delta has made me nervous: I’ll now bet we’ll see significant (incl. many hospitalizations/deaths) surges this fall in low-vaccine populations due to combo of seasonality, Delta’s nastiness, &amp; “back to normal” behavior. If you’re unvaxxed, you’ve made a bet… 19/ …that Covid is yesterday's news, &amp; that now seems like an awful bet. </p>
<p>He will be wrong, of course. The fearmongers have consistently been wrong. It hasn't stopped them before, and no one will care about his wrong prediction in a few months when it's clear.</p>
<p>&rt;Moreover, I worry that a right-leaning Governor who opened up early &amp; proudly (&amp; has gotten away with it so far) will be stubbornly unwilling to reverse course, even in the face of surging cases &amp; deaths.</p>
<p>LoL. Those damn Republicans! It's always their fault somehow!</p></p>

        <p>It's like Trump said.  You test fewer people, you'll have fewer cases.  Only testing people who are actually sick is the most accurate.  Any diagnosis needs to have clinical correlation of infection as well as a lab test.  There's such a thing as being colonized with virus pieces that aren't infectious.</p>

        <p>Not disagreeing with you. But there are plenty of people who get sick from COVID, but aren’t sick enough to be hospitalized. </p>
<p>And, if they’re vaccinated, they wouldn’t be counted as cases by the CDC.</p>
<p>It’s not just “asymptomatic” vaccinated people who wouldn’t get counted by the CDC.</p>

        <p>I know, the CDC should be counting symptomatic cases even if they aren't in the hospital.  You're right about that.  It's just not right they make a diagnosis for anyone soley on a lab test, especially the crap PCR test.</p>

<p>No, that's not true. The CDC doesn't control who gets counted. Data is collected and published at the state level. Anyone with a positive test gets counted. </p>
<p>&rt;As of May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned from monitoring all reported vaccine breakthrough cases to focus on identifying and investigating only hospitalized or fatal cases due to any cause. This shift will help maximize the quality of the data collected on cases of greatest clinical and public health importance.</p>
<p>&rt;Previous data on all vaccine breakthrough cases reported to CDC from January–April 2021 are available.</p>
<p>&rt;State health departments report vaccine breakthrough cases to CDC. CDC now monitors reported hospitalized or fatal vaccine breakthrough cases for clustering by patient demographics, geographic location, time since vaccination, vaccine type, and SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Reported data include hospitalized or fatal breakthrough cases due to any cause, including causes not related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>&rt;https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html</p>
<p>The CDC merely stopped collating and publishing state data of mild cases of reported breakthroughs on their breakthroughs pages. You can still get this data from the states. </p>
<p>No change whatsoever was made to the counting of actual new cases, which is based on state testing data.</p>

        <p>How about the drop in cases is because it's fucking summer and not the viral season. This isn't rocket science. It's going to be back in fall/winter like all endemic viruses (and that's not a problem). It's a full on crime against humanity to keep these lockdowns going into the summer. Absolute insanity even if they did have an effect.</p>
