    <strong>The "So why are they REALLY doing it" question</strong>
    <p><p>Although I have known the answer right from the beginning, I have held myself back from answeting it, because it's simply too much for most people. And because nobody enjoys being ridiculed by fools.</p>
<p>But the time has come to let this out. I think many people on this sub are now ready. A handful already know this but keep quiet for obvious reasons.</p>
<h1>Please do not read on if you have adverse reactions to "conspiracy theories".</h1>
<p>OK, here we go. First of all, I take no credit for originality. I learned everything I know on this topic from <a href="https://montalk.net/">Tom Montalk</a>. Here is a <a href="https://montalk.net/Discerning_Alien_Disinfo_v3.2.pdf">free little book</a> that he published many years ago that lays out the gameplan.</p>
<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> We are being prepped for alien hybridisation.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p>
<p>Humans are not at the top of the food chain, as we like to believe. The earth is effectively a farm where humans are harvested. We are harvested because of our emotional energy, life-force, chi, prana - whatever you call it - because in <a href="https://montalk.net/metaphys/267/sto-sts-and-densities">higher densities</a>, this emotional energy is a highly valued commodity, especially negative emotions like anger, hatred, sorrow, frunstration, fear, hopelessness, etc.</p>
<p>We are controlled all the time by unseen hands, who manipulate events in our lives to generate more and more negative emotions, which they then happily feed on.</p>
<p>These unseen hands primarily are negatively oriented alien overlords, but also higher-density occult entities. <strong>The NWO here on earth takes orders from these overlords.</strong></p>
<p>So why all this corona-BS? Something has changed in the negative alien hierarchy. Maybe a new faction has taken over, or they have seen a probable future where too many people are waking up here on earth - and they want to stop that.</p>
<p>The bottom line, the end goal so to speak, is alien-human hybridisation, so that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our free will is completely taken out.</li>
<li>Harvesting our negative emotions becomes super-efficient.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that's happening now is groundwork for those future steps. The "vaccine", the destruction of the economy, the fear-porn, transhumanism...</p>
<p>Montalk predicts that very soon aliens overlords will be officially unveiled to the world - <strong>BUT</strong> they'll be revealed as the good guys who can fix our economy, give us exciting new tech, and kindly allow us to become half-alien ourselves.</p>
<p>I give it 5 years before this becomes a reality.</p></p>

        <p>How would this theory explain happy-go-lucky people? If you have a farm of livestock, and they are being bred for a purpose (misery), what use would the happy ones be? Wouldn't you weed them out pretty early on, to create an environment of nearly total pain and suffering?</p>
<p>How does the author of these claims purport to see/know this information, if it's so invisible to everybody else?</p>

        <p>That is explained by the hypothesis that there are also positive aliens and positive occult entities, so it's not entirely analogous to a cattle farm. Plus for each of us, our karmic lesson requirements in this life plays a crucial role as to what kind of family, childhood or life experiences we might have.</p>
<p>Negative entities exploit our lesson requirements and provide us those lessons, but their intention is purely harvesting our life force, not providing lessons.</p>
<p>I suggest you take some time studying Montalk's work, because all questions are already answered there.</p>
<p>Finally, he is not the only one to know this. There are many, many people who know and research this. He's simply someone I found the easiest to read and the most in-depth.</p>

        <p>I've read a fair bit of this sort of thing in the past (eg Ra Material, Cassiopaea, misc channeled stuff), and it didn't sufficiently retain my belief, which is why I'd rather ask somebody who is "up to date" with the latest claims.</p>
<p>If you wouldn't mind answering one more question: how would this theory account for so-called 'enlightened' humans who have some kind of transformative experience that makes them feel eternal and totally free, and allegedly project a very pleasing human aura/presence such that other people feel greatly at peace in their presence?</p>
<p>(This in contrast to "researchers", people who read a lot or have direct involvement with channeled entities and then come to certain dire conclusions about human existence).</p>
<p>I ask because on the whole, with just about every one of those kinds of people I'm familiar with - none of them have anything to say about negative alien/spiritual presences, and claim that the human ego is the primary, or only impediment to (remembrance of) eternal freedom and happiness. But that once transcended, all 'problems' of any kind evaporate back into the nothingness whence they (merely apparently) came.</p>
<p>I've never been able to reconcile these two major belief systems - one a universe of independent entities, some good, some bad, generally fighting over humans or involved somehow - and the other, a universe of only apparent 'things', but that are really projections of a single, eternally safe mind, that only needs to wake up to itself again.</p>

        <p>There are two sides to it in my opinion.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the so-called “enlightened” people can indeed transcend all kinds of physical and mental suffering, and then their life simply becomes a series of experiences without judgement. Think about it. If you can enjoy the experience no matter whether you’re being physically attacked, beaten up, nailed to the cross, raped or boiled in hot oil, then you don’t care if there are negative entities behind the scene or not. Everything is just another experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these people may also have a purpose of imparting their teaching to the human race. The teaching they’d like to share would obviously be one of transcending the pain, rather than finding sources of pain, analysing the pain, or understanding who’s behind the pain. Because let’s face it, most of us conspiracy nerds find this stuff addictive. It’s very easy to get completely hooked into this and then descend into a spiral of depression and paranoia.</p>
