    <strong>Our local city has returned the basketball rims to our parks. More inside.</strong>
    <p><p>I've mentioned it before on this sub; for some reason the basketball rims were removed from our parks about 6 or 8 months ago.  And before that, the city was putting yellow tape around all of the tables and playground equipment etc.  Well, our mayor is active in our neighborhood watch page, and in one of her posts she stated that "our parks are our most valuable resource".  So I sent her an email, and said that in deference to what she said, and since the yellow tape had stopped happening around 4 or 5 months ago, the rims should be replaced too.  Her initial reply mentioned Governor Newsome's mandate that rims be removed, and I replied that since the governor cannot make any laws, and can only make mandates in case of emergency, and the mayor of our fair town has said that "parks are our most valuable asset" and that 'exercise is essential' then there is no emergency, and there is no law, so let's have our rims back.</p>
<p>Anyway, they are back, as of about a week ago.  And I see women and men, young and old, experienced and novice, enjoying the freedom of actually being allowed to throw the ball through the metal hoop.</p>
<p>My sarcastic, and skeptical side of me can't help but wonder how many grandmas we saved by having the basketball rims removed for all those months.</p>
<p>My other optimistic side rejoices in seeing all of these people freely enjoying the park's amenities again.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah, same thing here.  They kept putting up the caution tape and each day people would trample it down.  Next day, it's up again, rinse and repeat.  It's so funny though, the same city workers who were putting it up are the same people who <em>were</em> using the tables to eat their lunch.  So they had to sit on the grass instead.  When they were finally allowed to stop putting up the yellow tape, they were rewarded by being allowed to sit at the tables again.</p>
<p>But it all makes sense........Covid knows not to be on the grass, but instead attacks those who are trying to live their lives!</p>

        <p>Taking the time to remove basketball rims like that just makes it seem like you’re trying to make the population as miserable as possible</p>

        <p>He certainly did.  At some point I imagine there was a committee who got together and decided "hey, I know what let's do.........let's take down all the basketball rims!"...... and then it was so.</p>
