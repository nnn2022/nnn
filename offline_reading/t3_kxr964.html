    <strong>I have decided to be vocal</strong>
    <p><p>I work in house keeping at a hospital, In the beginning I was scared, but had doubts. Then our hospital hit record LOW numbers of patients. So I was confused. Then I accidentally walked into a Covid room without PPE and got paranoid. But I never got the virus. Then I got depressed because I couldn‚Äôt do the things I love for what seemed like no reason. </p>
<p>Then...I found this sub. And I believe deeply this is not about a virus. I don‚Äôt know the reason. I‚Äôm not a conspiracy theorist. But I disagree with all the new normal. Nothing makes sense. </p>
<p>Recently, I remembered the phrase ‚Äúthe only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.‚Äù</p>
<p>Now I speak to people, I ask questions. I debate the stance that hospitals are over run (they aren‚Äôt), I debate the necessity of masks (they are proven useless), I ask for proof that this virus is so fatal (statistics are facts).</p>
<p>Now I have begun to make stickers as I saw on this sub and I put them anywhere I can. I am making posts on Reddit when the circle jerk laughs because ‚Äúsome idiot‚Äù has questions and I recommend this sub. I politely encourage people that privately question the lockdown and masks to explore our community. I am down voted to oblivion. But I hope that maybe one single person with doubt in their heart views this subreddit and maybe that one person can help turn the tide. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm done with sitting idly by. My comment karma is in the toilet, but these posts are my true opinions and I am passionate about these words. I will step on the grenade for all of us. I just want to be active and help change all this, one tiny step at a time.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p></p>

        <p>Upvotes, downvotes, karma... It doesn't matter; they're just useless points in a database and you won't win an exotic car, a nice house or a boyfriend or girlfriend with it.</p>
<p>And remember: when you're downvoted, it's usually because you're saying something that doesn't sit well with those who want to remain in their bubble.</p>

        <p>As a fellow hospital worker, welcome. I've been doing it for months, and the most important thing I've learnt is that some people WANT to believe that this pandemic is what the government says it is. They want to believe their economy is being destroyed by a virus, and not by their elected officials.</p>
<p>I've been called a liar more times than I care to remember, but as.long as people are parroting the "hospitals are overflowing" lie, I will do my best to educate them.</p>
<p>Keep doing the good things you do. You're not going to convince a lot of people, but there might be people out there, who are unsure and wondering if their the insane ones for not believing the lies.  We need to show them that they are not alone.</p>

        <p>For me it was BLM. Suddenly the very same people, not only politicians and celebs, but even scientists, who lectured us on the ccp virus, suddenly said BLM was no great risk. Two weeks later, there was no death wave. I knew enough.</p>

        <p>I do agree with you on your point about most masks being proven useless. Unless it's proper PPE wear, the cloth masks that most people wear have been proven to be horrible at preventing the virus from spreading. However, your statement generalizing hospitals as being low capacity is not correct. My aunt works as an RN and following the holidays her hospital has been at absolute full capacity, along with many other hospitals in our area. They have had to convert multiple rooms because of how many patients they have in critical condition. While hospitals in lower populated areas may be coping well, please understand that is absolutely not the case everywhere else.</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt want to say my city, but it‚Äôs a major one. We are currently renovating several rooms. Think about that. So few patients, they are changing the wall paper.

        <p>I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you on all points. I fully believe you when you say your hospital is at low capacity. My point was just to bring to attention how hospitals have been disproportionately affected by this virus. Just because I myself do not work at a hospital does not mean I am unable to see that my hospital is posted as full capacity. The problem with this virus is that low income areas are affected more harshly by it, and my county is proof of it. Posting about how your hospital has been doing well distracts from how serious this issue has been for people living in impoverished cities.</p>

        <p>I enjoy a good argument. Let‚Äôs go. And I‚Äôll keep it respectful of course. Low income areas tend to work jobs where they are unable to work from home. So they will see a spike due to exposure because they have no option except to report to work. This includes me. I saw no difference, no increase in pay, no work at home. We are exposed disproportionately and that‚Äôs simply how life is now. I work with many people that have gotten the virus, and they returned to work. Not much different from the flu. So all these measures for what? It‚Äôs theater. If anything most of my coworkers hope for the virus to get 2 weeks paid off from work ironically. We are all overworked to meet the demand for insane cleaning expectations. But the truth is, we are told to avoid social media, we are asked to be quiet about the numbers. So if you don‚Äôt work in the hospital, you really have no true idea of the numbers of infection. I see the social media posts, but the fact is the same rn‚Äôs sit in the same chairs relaxed as always. We saw a small spike after the holidays, yes. But rooms remain open and ventilators unused, these are the facts. Finding real numbers online is difficult for an individual hospital. The virus is real, death is real. But it‚Äôs no different than many other plagues that kill untold numbers from car crashes to diarrhea. I don‚Äôt debate the severity of the illness, even across socio-economic lines, I debate the need to shut down the country and shame people who don‚Äôt want to wear a mask to buy a Coca Cola at the gas station without social stigma.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, I don't think you understand my comment as well. That's probably on me if I phrased it wrong. I really do agree with you on a lot of things here. I actually posted to this sub just a bit ago about unemployment rates causing deaths vs covid deaths. It's hard to know what situation your city is in, just as it's hard for you to know the same about my city. I know that my county is one of the worst for hospitals at full capacity in my state, despite there being much, much larger cities in other areas. We are struggling to keep up with the rise in cases, and I don't want that to be overshadowed by areas like yours where the hospitals are not struggling. When the places that are struggling are overshadowed by the places that are not, people will assume that the situation has gotten relatively better for all when that certainly isn't the case for counties like mine. I simply wanted to bring awareness to the struggles my community is facing in the hopes that they might receive some aid in a battle they're slowly losing. As I said in my post, my location is at a 17.7% unemployment rate, meaning people are dying in poverty in horribly high numbers. This area was already poor beforehand, so they weren't prepared for the devastation the lockdown caused. I just want to see the places that need help get that help without being ignored because certain cities are fine.</p>

<p>Right... So you're just kidding about all of this, how do you supposedly work at a hospital, and say this. Like, okay, you weren't protected and didn't get the covid... Right. But the chances of you getting it aren't 100%. So, if you work at a hospital, why wear masks at all, right? Why wear gloves too, they're useless!</p>
<p>&rt;I ask for proof that this virus is so fatal (statistics are facts).</p>
<p>Mortality rate isn't high, ok, but people still die from covid. Why do you even try to troll, lmao. Wtf.</p>

<p>You know most people died in 1918-1919 because of bacterial pneumonia <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/bacterial-pneumonia-caused-most-deaths-1918-influenza-pandemic">right</a>? That‚Äôs from 2008 before Covid was used as a political weapon. (Masks are breeding grounds for mold and bacteria) (bacteria won‚Äôt get through the mask but a virus will especially if it‚Äôs non medical which almost everyone wears) </p>
<p>If hospitals were overrun out society would be collapsing, it‚Äôs the canary in a coal mine. Even in my city, hospitals are near zero for patients. Which is weird they‚Äôd cancel elective surgeries ... almost like they want the sick to die. </p>

        <p>From the use of ventilators which have been shown to actually cause irreparable lung damage by force feeding the lungs. When you become dependant on a drug and you quit cold turkey chances are it‚Äôll kill you. Oxygen is by no means a ‚Äúdrug‚Äù however but the analogy still stands.</p>

<p>1/ globalist msm (ap/cnn brasil), so takes that with a grain of salt. upon further examination NONE of the sources (ap or cnn brasil) could provide a SINGLE picture of any overrun hospital except a few stock photos.</p>
<p>2/ IF we are being overrun again then just rebuild the field hospitals. we built tens of thousand of beds all over the country during the peak last year yet the majority of them received ZERO covid patients.</p>

        <p>bruh dont lose hope. the American spirit is still alive and well, and what you see/hear on TV or internet is just smoke and mirror from propaganda.</p>
<p>WE are the majority tho most people wont speak up probably due to fear of confrontation, peer pressure, losing jobs etc. </p>
<p>hence we should speak up more (in respectful manner tho) to break up that conditioning, to lead the way to other people. even if they dont agree with you that is a rare chance they get exposed to differing view points and hopefully that would lead to their own discovery.</p>
<p>on a grander scale, i really really hope that you can infer about the overall bigger picture from this covid bs, about how we are at the crosshair between socialism/authorization and freedom.</p>

        <p>No one cares about people who die from covid.  No one cared about the people who died from influenza either.  We never shut down the world and caused massive suffering over the flu so why should we do it for covid?   People are going to die and they do die from a million different things.  Why the hell should we only care about covid when we don't give a shit about any of the other methods?</p>
