    <strong>Obesity is now a virtue</strong>
    <p><p>I would never fat shame someone-- I used to be very obese myself. And I don't think it's constructive to bully someone when they <em>are</em> looking in the mirror with self-hatred every morning (let's be honest). </p>
<p>But for me that only goes so far as to allow a person to reconcile their life goals with how they see themselves. Unless they are blatantly lying to themselves, any sane person would think, "If I'm obese, the quality and span of my life is drastically reduced, I'm a burden on society, and I'm not living up to my full human potential." Full stop.</p>
<p>When the pandemic began, there was no mention whatsoever for the link between obesity and covid mortality. None. It was always advanced age and "pre-existing conditions" of which metabolic syndrome (obesity) were swept under the rug, and rare, nebulous disorders like "compromised immune system" were brought to the forefront as examples of why were should be mindful of not just the elderly, but literally any person. The problem is that by a huge margin, it is obesity that is the main pre-existing condition that is causing death in younger people. </p>
<p>It takes <em>decades</em> of self-abuse to bring someone to the point where they are easily wrecked by a respiratory illness. We are a society of people who cannot walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded. It is a fucking travesty. </p>
<p>From the Kaiser study:</p>
<p>&rt; Data from the 6916 patients in the study show that compared with those at normal body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 24 kg/m2, the risk of death more than doubled for patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 to 44 kg/m2 (relative risk of 2.68; 95% CI, 1.43 to 5.04) and nearly doubled again for those with a BMI of 45 kg/m2 (relative risk of 4.18; 95% CI, 2.12 to 8.26).</p>
<p>Part of me dies every time I hear "FLATTEN THE CURVE". A <strong>huge</strong> subset of the people ending up in hospitals were committing a very slow suicide for <em>decades</em> and not one fucking peep from a person in power. Not a dime spent on improving nutrition education. No incentives whatsoever for weight loss. Bandaid after bandaid after bandaid that <em>your</em> kids are going to pay for.</p>
<p>I could have predicted this-- "big is beautiful" has been around for years now. But what has been the last straw for me is now hearing people showing off their weight gain as some kind of badge of honor for staying home, drinking in excess, not putting in a modicum of effort into exercise (you can get very fit in a small apartment with no equipment), and "doing their part" to stay home. </p>
<p>We are so fucked.</p></p>

        <p>When I was fat I knew I was fat and I hated it. But that's all it takes to drive incentive to get healthy. The problem today is most people are brainwashed into thinking it's okay or even a good thing. </p>
<p>I find it funny that redditors idolize Asia for their mask wearing conformity. You know where they'll tell you you're fat right to your face? Asia. </p>
<p>At least they did to me when I was in Japan.</p>

        <p>Same I'm overweight and it's hating myself that causes me to stress eat. Like I know I'm fucking hideous and they all know it as well I hate that we have to make fat fucks feel good about themselves. I certainly don't and I'm on the smaller side of being overweight and I still have an hourglass shape. Fuck the fat acceptance movement.</p>

        <p>There's too much money in sugar and other refined carbs to actually put any sort of dent in obesity.</p>
<p>How many years had it taken to start actually pushing back against fossil fuels in any economically meaningful way? And we still manage to take two steps back for every three forward there.</p>
<p>And of course global warming is a problem that impacts everyone, everywhere. Food quality, cost, and the basic addictions that are inherent to obesity fall much more in line with the income inequality gap.</p>

        <p>This entire situation has lit a fire under to me to once and for all get my health under control.  I am not obese but I came way too close this year &amp; I could feel how unhealthy I was. I started having blood sugar issues which scared me more than anything. Since getting active &amp; significantly changing my diet, I’ve felt so much better! I am already feeling strong after 2 months of orange theory, long walks &amp; barre classes. I can do stairs without struggling to breathe (even in a mask) &amp; I did a stair-heavy walking tour in mid November that would not have been possible in July. </p>
<p>Covid didn’t scare me, the idea of being so susceptible to a virus like that kind of hit me as to how unhealthy I would have to be for my body to be unable to fight it. I also wanted to be able to participate in more outdoor activities like kayaking &amp; hiking &amp; biking. So I started taking vitamins, dropped the sugar almost entirely, curbed carbs &amp; exercise vigorously 5-6 days a week for an hour! I listened to actual scientists &amp; realized i had the power to change my situation. It sucks that it took this to wake me up but whatever works! I’m feeling a lot better already &amp; enjoying seeing myself get stronger &amp; healthier!</p>

        <p>Your comment about finding you have power over yourself is great, this is one of the things I really hate about the current conversation about health (both physical and mental), it skews hard towards making sure people feel alright with their situation and I think overshoots into apathy more often than not.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work and may you reap the benefits. So glad to hear it makes you feel good!</p>

        <p>I know I sound like an asshole saying it, but a big part of the reason I’m not afraid of this virus is because I’m not fat. I’ve been a healthy weight basically my whole life, except for a few times where I’ve fallen underweight, or was pregnant. People act like it’s all “luck”, but I try my best to make healthy eating decisions, and I’m sick of being shamed by people cot that. Am I afraid of becoming fat? Yes, not for vanity reasons, but because of all the health issues I have seen it cause</p>

        <p>Any time you want to talk about these issues somebody leaps in with ‘we must remember it’s counter productive to shame!’ regardless of whatever anyone is saying. As in you can say something totally impersonal like ‘this country has an obesity issue’  or ‘we have normalised eating too much, too often’ and it is shaming.</p>
<p>I really think it’s becoming a self fulfilling thing where the more and more carefully and gently people speak the further the line gets pushed as to what counts as shaming. Now mild cognitive dissonance when someone encourages you to do something that isn’t immediately pleasurable is shaming. We are deliberately embracing becoming softer and unable to cope with mild comments that cause us shame but have a free pass to write off any shame as the other person being a terrible human.</p>
<p>I am starting to think we need a bit more shame in our lives.</p>

        <p>I'm not skinny at all and I've been out and about. People fail to take responsibility for their health. I'm overweight with absolutely no co-morbidities and I don't eat mcdonald's or any of that trash. I think the real obese have an issue because they might have a ton of underlying health issues and that scares them so they have to scare us for "their safety" fuck them. Sorry I can't be nice anymore. If you can't take of your own health I'm not at fault for it and I'll continue to live my life. Ya know?</p>

        <p>Yeah we’re at a point where the actual pathogen is the last thing we blame for getting sick. It’s cold and flu season, shit happens. I’ve been sick a lot, including covid, and I never got a second blamed anyone or even myself.</p>

        <p>Yeah, and here is how you know all this shit isn't about health.  The role that obesity plays in susceptibility to COVID complications should be widely discussed.  "Experts" should be telling people that their best defense is to eat right and exercise daily, but instead, we tell people to sit on their fat asses and order contactless pizza.</p>
<p>On a side note, our governor must be good at following her own orders.  I have been watching the number of chins she has grow exponentially this year.</p>

        <p>Imagine if america offered real nutrition classes to kids throughout their education. Not nutrition based on the fake deceptive "food pyramids". I had someone tell me that we all need sugar in another sub. Someone posted about childhood obesity and I mentioned that sugar is added to everything , even bread and someone literally came back at me telling me that we need sugar. It's no wonder our kids are sick and obese. The food pyramid is a sham. No one needs any processed sugars. Period. It is crazy that there are people out there who believe that</p>

        <p>Somehow being obese makes you more important than a child struggling in poverty, school, or isolation. What. Happened. Nothing wrong with being obese but the way society obsesses over fat people without caring about helping those people is sinister. Obviously obesity makes some people a lot of money. Just like Covid... For 9 months all the propaganda resources could have been put into an exercise campaign and we could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Not from Covid per say since lots of "Covid deaths" are really obesity deaths recategorized, but from tons of diseases doomers don't care about (unless you had Covid within a month of the death). Obesity is a yearly pandemic. This shit is just so painfully obvious but people rather put on a mask and lock themselves in their rooms than actually help people.</p>

        <p>&rt; now hearing people showing off their weight gain as some kind of badge of honor for staying home, drinking in excess, not putting in a modicum of effort into exercise</p>
<p>I've not seen anyone doing this. Do you have some examples?  I don't  facebook.</p>
