    <strong>Not Q or antivax or even anti mask. I just prefer to think for myself (dangerous pastime I know)</strong>
    <p><p>That’s a beauty and the beast reference btw.</p>
<p>I consider myself a “believe it when I see it” type. This vaccine worries me because of the conditions in which it was created. Not to mention it is a vaccine meant to combat a virus that was most likely engineered by man. Few diseases (if any) have been this contagious throughout human history so it’s hard to believe it developed naturally. </p>
<p>Got news that’s not helping ease my mind. A respiratory therapist I have known my entire life finally tested positive for Covid after working throughout the pandemic. The part that’s getting to me is she started developing symptoms a day after her 2nd dose of the vaccine that she received Monday. Skip forward to today and she officially tested positive for the virus with symptoms. </p>
<p>Society is putting too much faith into an imperfect science. Be honest and call it what it is. A rushed product created for financial purposes. If due diligence was done this vaccine would still be months or more away from mass production. Now they are talking about 100 million vaccinations in the next 100 days? </p>
<p>Maybe when they’re done testing on the elderly I’ll feel more comfortable getting “the needle in my arm”. Personally I wish they had spent more time perfecting the vaccine in the lab.</p></p>

        <p>What on God's green earth makes anyone think that this experimental vaccine deserves the benefit of the doubt, or plausible deniability when it comes to harming people?</p>
<p>If someone tested for Covid, and died or anything at all happened to them, it was blamed on the virus.  Is that logical? No, but all the world's "experts" agreed that we should proceed in this manner.  (nevermind that thousands of other equally qualified experts dissented and were silenced for their disagreement)  Now we have to follow the same logic, or become terrible hypocrites who don't deserve to be trusted for anything.  </p>
<p>Your friend is having a vaccine injury (it didn't protect her, and now she's sick).  It sounds like it's less severe than Hank Aaron's, and I hope she recovers.  </p>
<p>There is no way that a "cure for the common cold" which has eluded scientists for 50 or more years could all of a sudden be created in under one year.  So far it's neither safe, nor effective.  </p>
<p>*This virus is not particularly contagious.  Measles is <strong>much</strong> more so.</p>

        <p>I can relate to this. 
I'm no more worried about Covid than I am about driving on the highway. Nor do I interact with anyone in a high risk category. Others should be responsible for their own risks and exposures. </p>
<p>There is way more concern for me about the vaccine. I'm not their lab rat.</p>

        <p>Completely agree with every word. Not to bring politics into it, but I find it very suspicious that the talking heads have never criticized Trump over "operation warp speed". They criticize him for everything else, especially when it has to do with the covid response. You would think this would be delivering ammunition on a platter. Pushing this vaccine out has been Trump's greatest failures. I understand why he did it. He wanted to do something to end the lockdowns, damage to the economy, etc, but I think he was tricked by some of the "professionals". Trump had questioned the safety of the MMR vaccine publicly during one of the primary debates. The rumor is that Baron Trump has high functioning autism.  So this was a complete 180.</p>
<p>You would think these Dems wouldn't want to be shown on tv getting "the jab" when it was part of Trump's plan. They are THAT petty. But they want people to get it. And I don't think it's for the individual good, or the greater good. Unless they consider less people the greater good  (which many of them do).</p>

        <p>I think there was a brief period of time when people wanted nothing to do with “Trump’s” vaccine, like he made it himself. But TPTB decided it was ok and those same people are now clamoring for their jab.</p>

        <p>I hope everyone getting tested right now is already using the newly revised PCR protocol just set out by the WHO. Keep seeing a lot of reports that the vaccine isn’t a true vaccine by definition too. There are so many questions that aren’t being answered truthfully it seems.</p>

        <p>I feel the same. I'd take a vaccine for malaria or whatever that's got a proven track record. </p>
<p>Also at this point I think it's obvious the whole Q Anon thing is one of two things either </p>
<p>1: 4chan trolls</p>
<p>2: A deep state psyop engineered to make people think that justice will come to bad people and there is a plan. It basically says wait and be patient and subdues them. </p>
<p>I also don't think masks are part of any grand conspiracy. I've never worn one because I don't want to and because they do nothing. But I think it's just the government virtue signalling to try and look like they are doing something.</p>
<p>We just live in a fucked up ecosystem where the media dramatizes everything for clicks. People read the news for the same reason they watch horror films. Then that pressures the government into doing stupid shitn like injecting the whole population with experimental drugs.</p>
