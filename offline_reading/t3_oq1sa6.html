    <strong>Viva Frei is running for Canadian Parliament</strong>
    <p><p>Viva Frei, the "litagator-turned-YouTuber", has just announced his candidature to run for the PPC in Canada's next election.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/uZpc8B4MTAo">Here</a></p>
<p>This is fantastic news for Canadians.  We have a very articulate, well-spoken, <em>lawyer</em> now speaking out against the current government measures and mandates.  Previously he had been dropping truth bombs all over our country with his videos.  If he is running for Parliament, he could really make a difference.</p>
<p>This is great news for Canada.  The Resistance just gained an enormous Ally.  Could this mean the tide is changing?</p>
<p>If you've never heard of Viva Frei, check out his channel.  Especially if you are Canadian.  </p>
<p>Great, great news Canadians.  The cavalry is on the way.  Some of us will no longer take this sitting down.  Go Viva Frei!!</p></p>
