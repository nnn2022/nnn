    <strong>Lockdowns are ruining dating</strong>
    <p><p>It may not sound like a big deal but as someone who's at the point in their life where they want to start thinking about finding a long term partner and having kids this whole thing is a real b*tch. It's so hard to make a real connection or even flirt with anyone in a public setting as everyone has their dumbass masks on. (Not to mention I don't want to flirt with someone if I don't know what they look like, haha sorry)</p>
<p>It kind of forces you to use apps like tinder which has its own set of problems, like wasting time with girls only to find they are scared of in person meet ups. Or going out on a date and having to worry the whole time about touching and being too close. It's fucked up and ruins all the romance.</p>
<p>Not to mention having nothing open makes it bloody impossible to find a fun date spot, I guess we'll just do another park hang (eye roll)</p>
<p>It just sucks and makes it feel the whole effort to try and date right now is not worth it. Which might have lasting impact for people like me who are in crucial years of finding a good romantic partner.</p>
<p>Have anyone else experienced this?</p></p>

        <p>I've also noticed that people who are most comfortable with lockdowns are people who already live with their Long term Significant others, I'm sure they'd change their tune if they were single and lived alone.</p>

        <p>They always say this "I'm happy to get quality time with my spouse/kids " (that by the way the they made the choice to intentionally  ignore the rest of their lives) For people like me that are in critical years its ended the chance for me to have kids</p>

        <p>Yep, they're speaking from a place of total privilege, forgetting about people in the young professional age range who just landed on their feet, they kick our legs out from under us. </p>
<p>Please don't give up hope though, you still can have kids, it's just harder at this point in time. Never give up!!!</p>

        <p>This is true, it's good you're thinking about it, not sure if you're a guy or girl but could be worth looking into storage options where they freeze your sperm/eggs. From what I heard it's not too expensive and is a pretty good hedge for people who need to have kids later in life.</p>

        <p>I'm a girl (woman) and women have limits that guys do not have. And again thank you, but doing that is a really nasty procedure, not something to take lightly like the media makes it seem, and there are other things to consider, the toll on your body as you get older, and the toll of raising kids at an older age</p>

        <p>It is obvious there are legions of people out there who would seek to deny you any opportunity to improve your life, likely far more than you thought. Giving up the struggle, however, will only guarantee failure. We must stay strong and keep up the fight.</p>

        <p>This sort of social and economic cannibalism is embedded into our entire society. It would be no stretch at all to say that our social system is based around the old looting more and more of the young's ever-dwindling resources, caring nothing for what happens after they inevitably pass away.</p>

        <p>This too. In the beginning of this I was the only person I knew who lived alone and found I couldn't relate to literally anyone. The people I know that were most comfortable with everything are my friends that are happily married and cozy already. Figures.</p>

        <p>Exactly, have a coworker who spend most of these months taking care of his child (Paid by Gov) then when we had to return he brought a car just to not wear masks.</p>
<p>His wife and kid seems to be everything for him and he is over the partying and "fun" period so he happily likes our regimes new restrictions.</p>
<p>I find exactly ignorant he can say I complain too much when he is in no way the same situation.</p>
<p>Now I will say something that is not popular at all, but if these restrictions continue I hope they do something against people with partners because most partners spread the virus to each others.</p>
<p>If I can't see my friends were chance of spread is low why can they see their spouse were chance of spread is high?</p>
<p>It's really time the privileged have to suffer the consequences of these lockdowns too.</p>
<p>Just hope we open up soon.</p>

        <p>Yes this. And if you purposely go to places or areas where everyone is more lax about this stuff it’s setting you up to meet people with similar views on all this as you, which is awesome. </p>
<p>I was worried about dating too but found early on it’s easy to find people who align with my views. On the apps I’d just ask people if they were cool meeting in person and if they’d be okay if I didn’t wear a mask. If the answer to either was no, I’d move on. Surprisingly almost everyone I asked was like oh of course, all this is so ridiculous. </p>
<p>I met the guy I’m seeing now at the gym. We have a state mask mandate, so I hopped on the Facebook Reopen group for my state and asked if anyone could message me with gyms that didn’t require masks. I got a few responses and sure enough found a gym where nobody does the distancing and mask shit, just normal gym etiquette. People are extra friendly, I think because we’re all happy to be around others who feel the same, and it’s easy to meet people knowing they have the same views on all this. I started talking to a guy there and it’s been great. </p>
<p>Point is, while yes it can be harder to meet people naturally now (can’t just walk up to someone in a bar in most places for example), you have a unique opportunity to put yourself in places and situations that will get you around others who feel the same way about all this shit and form a closer connection over that “bond”. See if your location has a “reopen” group or something similar or see if someone on here lives nearby and can message you places that don’t do all this restriction and mask crap (ask for it by direct message-last thing you want is for some jerk to see and report them), and there you’ll find others who have the same views and people who are looking to meet others who do too.</p>

        <p>100% agree.</p>
<p>I actually reconnected with someone I used to date years ago during all of this and I really think the "plandemic" is what brought us together. He drove down to visit me in New Orleans and kept telling me to fly out to New York to spend time with him, and now here we are almost 8 months later and I moved back to New York and we're getting a place together in a couple of weeks :)</p>
<p>I definitely feel for you because I do get it. This clown world time has really shown me the true colors of so many people. The fact that my now boyfriend and I thought it was all so crazy and could see right through the propaganda was really the tipping point for us. I couldn't be with anyone that was a doomer or went right along with this ridiculous agenda. So my advice for you is: Keep your chin up. Your people are out there. Don't let the media and even social media and dating apps drive you away and discourage you. There are real people out there like you and me that feel and think the way that we do. Like the user above me said, look at it as a helpful tool for weeding out all of the sheep and dates that would be a complete waste of time. I remember reading an article stating that women found men with masks "more sexy" and I couldn't stop laughing. They're trying to spoon-feed us this complete bullshit and you have to find it hilarious or it's just going to depress you! It's like okay dude, you think you know what women find most sexy... I'm telling you right now if a man is being a complete pansy and always wearing his mask no matter where he goes that is definitely not sexy to me. I'm scared for our future like jesus christ.</p>

        <p>It's been like 8 months since I've gotten hammered in a bar, gotten rejected by a woman entirely out of my league, gotten more hammered, then suddenly waking up in bed with chicken nuggets on my chest.</p>

        <p>I hate online dating, I <em>really</em> don't want to do it through an app, and I feel like now my only other option is to stay single and that's not really an option. This stupid lockdown/restriction garbage is stealing one of my last good years for this... I don't really have much time left to get with someone and have a family. I waited because I thought that was the right thing to do. Playing by the rules. Don't look for someone until I'm debt-free, make sure I have some skills and good traits to bring to the table, etc. And I got screwed because very shortly after I ticked off those boxes, the rug got pulled out from under me.</p>
<p>The silver lining is that there's a filter: any guy who has his boxers in a twist about masks and social distancing is not the guy for me. I need someone who can reason things out, who doesn't blindly trust and obey what Big Brother and Big Sister Media tell him, and who would rather be free than locked up in a "safe" cage.</p>

        <p>Anyone want to start a dating app, for those not in favor of this crap? I'd totally be for one, myself. Ah well, at least right away on profiles, you can sniff out those who'd likely be the doomer type. And avoid such people.</p>

        <p>It is! 2-3 weeks wouldn't have been a big problem and that's part of why at first I didn't gripe too much about restrictions. I should have known it would last much longer, but didn't. Back in March we had less information to work with (and plenty of false information that we didn't know for sure was false yet) and sitting out of life other than going to work and other basics for a couple of weeks is a relatively minor inconvenience. I'd have been sidelined even further for a week if I got flu or was injured at work anyway, things happen. 7 months with no end in sight is too much, even with only partial restrictions. That's enough to kill businesses and wreck people's personal lives.</p>

        <p>It's been rough as well as a recently single guy. Part of the reason I broke up with my last girlfriend was that she was extremely anxious and hyperbolic about COVID. She would call or text me all of the time scared out of her mind because of something she recently read, and would sometimes refuse to hold hands, kiss, or hug because she was worried about passing it to her family. Our "dates" during lockdown consisted of hanging out in her parents backyard, masked, 6 feet apart, watching TV on the projector, not being able to hold hands or cuddle. One of the things that helps is realizing that I'm better off dating someone who will not turn into a paranoid recluse.</p>
<p>I've been taking my time to focus on physical fitness and my hobbies instead of dating. If the amount of girls/guys who don't want to meet is getting you down, that might be the best thing to do.</p>

        <p>I'm around that same age, and I had a long string of mental health issues (anxiety, depression, fears of various intangibles such as commitment and abandonment), toxic relationships (the most toxic of which were also the hardest to let go of and made me very emotionally inaccessible after they ended), and I was way overcommitted with work and had no free time.  I was basically not <em>trying</em> to meet anyone because I thought it would be unfair to drag another person into the dysfunctional web of my life.</p>
<p>I was starting to get my shit together in late 2019, to the point where I was satisfied with life and was feeling good about sharing it with another person.</p>
<p>But lockdowns reversed years of progress, I'm a neurotic mess again, and even if someone could tolerate me like this they're probably hiding behind a fucking doomer sheep COVID rag because New York is an extreme-left hellhole like that.</p>
<p>Guess I'll die alone 🤷‍♂️  And the lockdown cheerleaders will call it a COVID death</p>

        <p>These people don't care about the future, so if the human race goes extinct after they're dead it means nothing to them. Perhaps that's an exaggeration, but sometimes I wonder.</p>

        <p>I've never had any trouble finding women who are not woke and not COVID doomers. It might be the place you live in, but in that case the men would probably be much the same way (the gender gap is real on these issues but it isn't all that large). I suspect you're looking for like-minded women in the wrong places.</p>

        <p>OMG this makes my heart hurt but with your winning attitude, I know that you will find the right woman to settle down with and start the next chapter in your life together. You have no idea how attractive it is as a woman to hear that eligible young men want marriage and babies and houses too. That's why I knew my husband was the one by our third date! I'm so sorry the world is making it so hard for you all and how difficult it must be to be single right now, but you're a keeper, and the girl that meets you and marries you is a very lucky lady. Don't let them take your joy from you - share it with her. She's out there and she's frustrated that she can't find you yet either. Have faith!</p>

        <p>or we want someone for companionship and partnership - something you figure after the second and third date.</p>
<p>the first date is all about sex appeal. how do you manage sex appeal on a dating app? it's just not the same. i think for people who are looking for real relationships right now are trying to feel out that third date vibe, but online and virtually.</p>
<p>plus, a lot of people are dating for the sole purpose of getting ass. which is fine - a sexual relationship is fine - but it makes a lot of people feel used because they want something more than sex from the other person. it's frustrating to keep meeting people who only want something physical when you want something deeper. something forever! </p>
<p>a one-night stand is hella fun, and something they become something more. but damn if it feels good to meet another person who is looking for a future partner. male, female, i don't think it matters. i hope that men don't think women are just looking for money, yikes! i can't go around thinking that all men only want sex. trying to give people the benefit of the doubt here, lol.</p>
<p>i certainly do not envy anyone dating right now, whether they're 20 or 50.</p>

        <p>My point was more that being attractive is what makes them eligible. Nobody cares about the short, ugly guy with his shit together. Or they do, but they just want the money part of it. Ask me how I know.</p>
<p>I love how women, no matter their personality or physical attractiveness, are like, oh it sucks being able to just have sex when we want companionship too! Meanwhile the average guy struggles to get either.</p>

I have one more outdoor date this year- an amusement park on Halloween, but I have to wonder if that will be my last date before next April or May, when the weather warms up again and outdoor activities become an option again.</p>

        <p>I've been fortunate as I've been able to make connections with girls that were comfortable meeting in person and being intimate. But what I've realized is what the fuck is the point of having kids. It's so fucking economically draining to do now that two incomes are basically required, let alone when you have a "pandemic" holding your job security hostage.</p>

        <p>Tell me about it. A year ago I was making great money, living on my own, reducing my debt, increasing my savings, and dating a bit. </p>
<p>Now I make 1/4 of what I did, live with my parents, don’t make enough to save or reduce my debt, with zero dating for the prior reasons. </p>
<p>I’m still on dating apps but I honestly just don’t have the money to do anything beyond park dates, which I can’t do when it’s freezing outside now, or maybe coffee. Can’t bring girls back to my parents house when they both work from home now and siblings are at home for school.</p>

        <p>Dating has been awful before the lockdowns imo, but now it's even worse. I recently moved to a new city so I've been relying on social events for meeting people and lockdowns have definitely brought that to a grinding halt. I'm fortunate to live in a southern state though, so social events are finally starting to come back here. I can't even imagine what people are going through in places that are still under heavy lockdown like California.</p>
<p>What's even worse than the lockdowns though, has been the complete political indoctrination of people in my generation. Even living in a southern state (though I do live in Nashville which is a big city), it seems like the vast majority of women I meet that's within my age group are staunchly left-wing and have bought into various levels of 'doomer'-ism, so it's been very hard to find to anyone like-minded.</p>

        <p>It is a really big deal. Childbearing from existing couples will implode, but a longer-term effect will be much fewer people forming relationships in the first place, which will mean fewer and sadder people in the future.</p>
<p>The demoralization for anyone seeking love or romance because of this must not be underestimated; love, lust, attraction, and pleasure are not frivolities, they are the fertile soil from which human life itself is born and nurtured. A world that connives against them is a world that doesn't deserve our allegiance.</p>

        <p>At least you can go to the park. While I doubt I'd get a ticket for it, we're not currently allowed to even do that. In any case, it's starting to get too cold for outdoor dates. Soon, my only option will be to invite strangers directly to my apartment. I'm seriously considering moving. Unfortunately I signed an 18 month lease right before this pandemic started and the job market isn't the best.</p>

        <p>I have been single for a year now after a toxic relationship. I got therapy and was truly ready to date in February. You can guess how that turned out. Everything I gained from therapy is now lost because her message was completely proven untrue. I don't have other chances, that toxic ex is the last I may ever have. I'm being blasted by social media that I need to obsess over my exes, not move on. I now get to be 24 and cry nightly about being an old maid and there's nothing to be done unless I find a sympathetic doctor to let me drug myself into nothing.</p>
<p>I've been on two dates this year, the first after a 2 MONTH zoom "relationship". Both were super into masks and it made an already tenuous situation worse. They were both walk dates, which I wasn't going to accept anymore because it's a bad way to gage someone's commitment, but the only option now. Zoom relationships are worthless because its impossible to gage attraction and vibes over video.</p>

        <p>Lost someone recently who i was dating for 5 months who was like-minded like us and was cool with doing stuff like ice skating and muesums and eating out (although with a mask on but only when it was actually required). Man, its been the worst trying to find someone again. This one actually said she wants to sit 6 feet apart at a park sipping boba under the mask. I tried to keep a straight face on the facetime call but it is what it is. Idk about this date tho</p>
