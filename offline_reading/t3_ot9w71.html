    <strong>A word to gym goers, buy whatever workout gear you need now before it's too late!</strong>
    <p><p>I'm praying it doesn't come to fruition but there may be another lockdown or vaccine passport for those of us unvaccinated sometime before the end of this year. If you buy your equipment now you can beat the price surges and potentially out of stock items like we saw last lockdown.</p>
<p>Of course it's a gamble as those things might not happen but weights at least have good resale value on kijiji so you wouldn't lose too much money in the long run.</p>
<p>Stay swol friends</p></p>

        <p>I'm just thankful I built my deadlift platform before lumber got expensive. Thinking about getting a freezer chest right now... Wife and I probably eat 15lbs of meat every week so even if nothing happens we will still save money buying our cuts wholesale.</p>

        <p>In my city, there was an exception in the mask ordinance for physical activity. My gym chose to be more restrictive. Once people started cancelling en masse, they came out with a "waiver" you could sign to be exempt from the mask. THEN WHAT IS THE POINT??? I cancelled and when they asked if it was because of the masks, I said yes. They offered me the waiver and I declined. I shouldn't have to sign a waiver to work out as I always have.</p>
<p>Funny, I keep getting emails from them running "former member specials."</p>

        <p>Huh, well for them play stupid games win stupid prizes. </p>
<p>My guess would be the same if they started implementing vaccine passports, I would imagine a large part of the population who aren't getting vaccinated are avid gym goers (because we know health is a personal responsibility) so it would probably be the final nail in the coffin if they implemented it. </p>
<p>Glad to hear you stopped supporting them, vote with your dollars!</p>

        <p>I've started my calisthenics journey in the middle of winter, outside, alone, in a "park" with few trees and weird bars to workout. Then decided to incorporate gym machines. Already have extra weight vest, few dumbbells, resistance bands, smaller parallel bars that can be put together quickly. Lockdowns or excluded from the gyms, I don't need any shiet or to go anywhere, to create a good workout, only creativity combined with simplicity. If that's how I need "to struggle" then so be it. All i know is I'll still be working out and keeping my immune system naturally healthy. As a student, if I'll have to get tested/vaccinated to get a job, heck nah. I'll simply focus the hardest on my two hobbies, training and drawing/doodling and hopefully to somehow make it easier to at least support myself, while living with my parents. But then again, one(if not more) of my local gyms operated illegally during the whole previous lockdown season, I'm pretty sure they will be working this lockdown as well. And if someone wants troubles, I can best bet they are going to fill a lawsuit for "experts" to prove everything that's going on around this bs plandemic. We don't even mind contributing money for the best lawyer, who is still censored. But on another side, lawyer would probably work for free, he's working for good of people in these hard times as well. LET'S GO BEASTS, WE WORKING OUT EVERYWHERE IF NECESSARY</p>
