<li>Depriving them of the right to a full education (UDHF Article 26)</li>
<li>Preventing normal healthy and necessary social activity and sports with peers (UDHR Article 20)</li>
<li>Terrifying nose swab testing against a child’s will or desire and mandatory vaccinations (UDHR Article 5) without informed consent</li>
<li>Terrifying and manipulating children about their own possible harm through media propaganda and deception</li>
<li>Gaslighting them into believing they might be killing grandma or a teacher</li>
<li>Forcing them to spend their whole day online, thereby increasing opportunity for internet predator contact, cyber bullying, sexting etc</li>
<li>Compelling many children sexually abused within families to remain 24/7 amongst their abusers</li>
<li>Increasing the risk to captive children in a household of increased drinkers and drug abusers*</li>
<li>Increasing the risk of captive children being subject to, or in the vicinity of, domestic abuse*</li>
<li>Subjecting them to the new and intentionally dehumanising school distancing measures. Masks at school all day, plexiglass boxes, bubbles, OCD-exacerbation.</li>
<li>Putting an intolerable strain on children already experiencing and suffering from mental health issues. Not only are they deprived of friends, they are prevented from seeking familiar forms of therapy.</li>

<p>* Since police and consumer statistics indicate that alcohol and drug consumption has risen during lockdowns, as have domestic abuse calls - adults on adults, adults on children, children on adults etc - to the police and charity phone lines.</p></p>

        <p>Okay, I'll bite. Here we go...</p>
<p>&rt; Depriving them of the right to a full education (UDHF Article 26)</p>
<p>Nothing requires full education to take place in a school building nor deems in-class education as any better or more effective than education in other contexts.</p>
<p>&rt; Preventing normal healthy and necessary social activity and sports with peers (UDHR Article 20)</p>
<p><em>Coronavirus itself</em> is preventing normal healthy contact between children. There is no way around that other than a vaccine. Social contact without a vaccine is not <em>healthy</em> social contact; it's child endangerment.</p>
<p>&rt; Terrifying nose swab testing against a child’s will or desire and mandatory vaccinations (UDHR Article 5) without informed consent</p>
<p>Seriously? Article 5 is about torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Necessary and normal medical testing doesn't apply here. Children can't provide informed consent on anything anyway.</p>
<p>&rt; Terrifying and manipulating children about their own possible harm through media propaganda and deception</p>
<p>I see where this is going...</p>
<p>&rt; Gaslighting them into believing they might be killing grandma or a teacher</p>
<p>What covid measures are actually doing this? Are you saying covid-19 isn't a danger to adults or old people?</p>
<p>&rt; Forcing them to spend their whole day online, thereby increasing opportunity for internet predator contact, cyber bullying, sexting etc</p>
<p>Children who would otherwise attend in-person classes are now forced to spend their class time in virtual classes with their teacher and classmates. Other than that, they aren't forced to engage in internet activity. Parents are also ultimately responsible for monitoring their internet activity.</p>
<p>&rt; Compelling many children sexually abused within families to remain 24/7 amongst their abusers</p>
<p>Yes, this is a serious concern. </p>
<p>&rt;Increasing the risk to captive children in a household of increased drinkers and drug abusers*</p>
<p>What does the asterisk indicate? Are there sources regarding the purported increase in drinking and drug use among parents? If so, that would also be a concern.</p>
<p>&rt;Increasing the risk of captive children being subject to, or in the vicinity of, domestic abuse*</p>
<p>Yes, this is a serious concern.</p>
<p>&rt; Subjecting them to the new and intentionally dehumanising school distancing measures. Masks at school all day, plexiglass boxes, bubbles, OCD-exacerbation.</p>
<p>Are kids going to school all day or are they at home online all day? I'm getting confused. Also, I think "intentionally dehumanising" is a bit of a strong phrase. This logic also means lots of regular places and things were "intentionally dehumanising" well before covid (hospitals, lunch ladies, science laboratories, construction zones, museums, etc.). Separating children from people and things as a way of protecting them and others is not "intentionally dehumanising". But I do see the potential for unintended negative social impacts given the separation. </p>
<p>&rt; Putting an intolerable strain on children already experiencing and suffering from mental health issues. Not only are they deprived of friends, they are prevented from seeking familiar forms of therapy.</p>
<p>If they're already being treated or cared for by a professional, I imagine that care has continued. I also imagine parents seeking to have their child seen by a mental health professional are able to do so. But yes, kids cannot easily seek out mental health care that would otherwise be available at school. Is this strain "intolerable" though? For some, possibly. But nothing indicates it's universally intolerable, and that is improbably anyhow.</p>
<p>&rt; Depriving them of warm, physical affection from loved ones</p>
<p>Except for the ones they are at home all day with...</p>
<p>Edit: expecting a lot of downvotes. I wasn't aware of r/NoNewNormal but it seems like a place that might not welcome logical dissent.</p>

        <p>It is logical dissent of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence">paperclip maximizer</a> variety. More people are mingling each day. No arguments will change that. Let’s stop hurting kids.</p>
<p>I upvoted you.</p>
