    <strong>China is Destroying the West from the Inside Out</strong>
    <p><p>I originally posted the following on r/conspiracytherories but it fits so well here and I'm an active lurker.</p>
<p>Firstly, I'm new around here, so please forgive me if this is a theory that's already being discussed. To be quite honest, I'm kind of scared to post this because of what it entails. </p>
<p>I'm a 22 year old woman living in the United States, meaning I was born when things seemed like they were good and we were heading in a great direction as a country overall in terms of gender equality, racism, sexuality, ect. and technology was also starting to get better and better as I grew up. I remember using a boxy PC with AOL when I was younger and my parents using flipphones.</p>
<p>It seems like somewhere in the 2010's we started getting unnecessarily divided as a country. This also so happens to be around the time the internet was in the hands of more people, and social media had become more prevalent... Interesting...</p>
<p>I remember when my school phased out the National Anthem. I remember when we started to deem "Merry Christmas" as offensive. I remember when race started to become important again for scholarships and job hirings. Holy- look at things now. I can't imagine what school is like for the younger generation. I hear about it though.</p>
<p>I bet you can guess what side of politics someone is on if they simply say "Bless America." Or God forbid, "God Bless America."  </p>
<p>I know you know.</p>
<p>I mean really. What are we fighting each other for? We are living in the best time to be alive! We have access to any information in SECONDS, we don't even have to leave the house to get just about anything we want or need unless our jobs require us too. We have health care that's as advanced as it's ever been (no I'm not vaccinated, but I'm not talking about this, guys.) Most importantly, we have all our FREEDOMS. Sure we have a few touchy political topics, but those are, generally speaking not things people would actually <em>kill</em> each other over (unlike slavery). </p>
<p>Ok I'll be getting to the point here shortly now.</p>
<p>I think we all know and can agree that we're divided right now but most people don't seem to really have a clue why. I think I do. We know big tech is listening to us 24/7 and we know that they target us with ads, we literally know this to be a fact. We know big tech is on the left side of politics, we know they censor people with views that stray from the narrative... We know China has ambitions to become the world superpower by the year 2049. I think they are doing it by a funneling money to tech companies and politicians to divide us as a country by making sure half the country hates the other through targeted propaganda online. </p>
<p>Propaganda and manipulation is nothing new, and with the invention of the internet it's been made easy to not only create, but to target, split, and divide a population of people to belive whatever they want them to. They could also be creating convincing fake profiles, to use as fuel to the fire in comments sections, further reinforcing whatever idea they want to push as group think and herd mentality is real and effective, as demonstrated recently by shit-show we're in as a result of a virus THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR.</p>
<p>We know they restrict internet access for their citizens, and this is not only to control what their population sees in terms of their agenda, but to also keep other nations from doing the same thing to them. They want to turn the West communist over time and they're willing to play the long game.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking your time to read this. I'm looking forward to reading and having a conversation about this theory with you all as I know this sub has a lot of open minded people. Maybe some of you can expand on this theory or share things that could lead me into a different direction.</p>
<p>Hopefully they don't come for me haha. I'm starting to get paranoid with all the craziness going on right now, this is just my best guess as to why!</p></p>

        <p>"the best time to be alive"? LOL Maybe for the middle class and rich. You weren't around in the 1980s when people used to shop for recreation and there was so many leisure activities to do. Life was more than work and people still talked to one another. You must be young enough where you haven't had to pay your own rent on a McJob or something yet, and know what it is to live out of milk crates and on ramen noodles. Life quality in the USA has sunk like a rock. Can the "America is so rich" crap. As for communism, we have post capitalism now, google "third way economics", the system wants in the gutter bootstrapping for you while they gave trillions of handouts to the banks. As for advancements in medical care, that's for the uber wealthy too, they still can't cure most things. They do what makes profit. Oh sure China could be taking over--just wait until the dollar loses reserve status--but our elite want to take down the West too and are united in these efforts, the chessboard is being reshuffled.</p>

        <p>Ok I will never lie about my upbringing and that I was born to a lower middle class family that worked it's way up to middle to possibly upper middle (I don't speak with my parents anymore.) However, after I graduated high-school my parents kicked me out at the age of 18, and I was living in a dingy basement studio of an apartment. It was cheap though. I actually worked a job worse than McDonalds and I'm actually embarrassed to say what it was. It involved a lot more manual labor and fiflth. After about a year and a half of living on my own and going through periods of employment and unemployment, I found something that worked for me. I moved in with my long distance BF and have been working on and off, so I'm privileged in that sense but I had to grind for a couple years, and I'm still very uncertain about my future. </p>
<p>I also think you're right that it's not the best time to be alive for socializing with other people, and not having to worry about being politically correct and stuff....</p>
<p>I think that the leftist agenda has caused the quality of many of our lives to get worse.</p>

        <p>I hate both right and left. Both ignore the economics of true working people and have betrayed the working classes and more. I am a leftist but disaffected with the left now, and burned out on politics. Everything is for the billionaires now, the system is corrupt beyond belief. I am glad you were able to move beyond horrible jobs and find something that works. I just don't want you taken in by the propaganda they tell us about America. This place has been going down the chute a long time. I am old enough to remember when the infrastructure looked a lot better.  I hope things turn out better for you. If you get a chance go to Google Earth and explore cities, some places are looking 100 years ahead of America, this is one thing I did a few years ago. I do think what I consider as the neo-liberals have lost their minds, with this Covid fascism, but don't want Handmaid's Tale from the other side and low wages and being told to go to the gutter because I am disabled.  The political system is crooked as hell across the board.</p>

        <p>IMO things started breaking down in the mid-late 90s when businesses started shipping manufacturing jobs to low wage countries. Most of our societal problems stem from this point.</p>
