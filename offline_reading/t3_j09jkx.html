    <strong>The last few months have removed any doubt that a terrible fascist dictatorship with concentration camps could happen at any time - and many would even cheer for it</strong>
    <p><p>Though this time it were worldwide.</p>
<p>Mandatory muzzles, forced isolation, threat of forced injections, random imprisonment, checkpoints, getting a gun-shaped temp-scanner pointed on your head whenever you enter a building, etc. etc.</p>
<p>And all they do is add a paper-thin veil of "care" to their threats and violence and many fall for it, though I suspect some go along with it and even spread the propaganda in the hope to become the concentration-camp-guards later.</p>
<p>Honestly I'm terrified what might be further imposed upon us, the brutal insanity is unbelievable, and it wont get less bad in winter, quite the contrary. "Health-passports", constant tracking and random ~~quarantines~~ imprisonment don't even seem much of a question at this point, even long-term, but who knows how far they will go.</p>
<p>You guys at least have guns, here only the cops and soldiers have them, and many even like it that way. Though they might rethink that one.</p></p>

        <p>As a Jewish person who hates casual Holocaust comparisons, I wholeheartedly agree with you. Especially as NYC has decided to blame a recent uptick in cases on Hasidic communities. </p>
<p>I think I see it most in the widespread adoption of dehumanizing language (eg plague rats) and the strong desire to definitively blame people who don‚Äôt follow the (highly arbitrary) rules for all the various self-inflicted ‚Äúproblems.‚Äù When you see people talking about someone who goes to a restaurant as a ‚Äúplague rat‚Äù who is ruining life for everyone and ‚Äúdeserves to die,‚Äù it‚Äôs really hard to ignore the similarities.</p>

However yes I'm the same way. They're wishing death on people like really? These people are normal people who are living their lives not running around looting, rioting, killing innocents. I'm so sick of the same media fed rhetoric.</p>

<p>Very true, and even if they knew about it, what could they do against heavily armed fascists that torture and murder masses of innocents?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;people tell me "this isn't Nazi Germany"</p>
<p><em>"Just wear your yellow badge, it's such a small inconvenience."</em></p>
<p>Most people think for some reason the nazis did't hide their fascism behind some paper-thin veil of "care" or some pseudo-reasons as well. And for most people it wasn't all that obvious where this were heading, much like today.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course I could be completely wrong but the parallels are definitely there and the threat is very real.</p>

        <p>The difference is that EVERYBODY has to wear masks. Unlike the yellow star, masks are not a tool to separate a certain group of people from the majority. I don't know, but that seems a pretty big difference to me.</p>

        <p>Why does nobody mind that we "give away our right" to, let's say, walk around naked in supermarkets? That's just the government telling us to be dressed at all times too. </p>
<p>"Sheer malice", really? Somebody asked what the difference is between the Yellow Stars in Nazi Germany and the masks nowadays, and I answered the question. Don't see any malice here. But then again, I also think it's disgusting to even think of comparing the killing of six million people with making people wear masks, so what do I know.</p>

        <p>Well they didn't instantly kill that many people. They needed compliance and needed neighbors to snitch on others. They needed to instill fear. Seems like the same tactics are being used now. Maybe they can't all throw us in camps because that's already been done but who knows what will be discreetly done.</p>

<p>Blatant straw-man and thought-stopping attempt. People here obviously aren't claiming the killing of 6 million people and forcing people to wear masks were the same thing, and you know that.</p>

<p>What actually appears to be quite disrespectful to all the people who suffered because of some fascist dictatorship is trying to shame people for pointing out similarities to such oppressive regimes while they try to make sense of the situation they are trapped in.</p>

<p>Yeah those dangerous water droplets in the air, much better to just constantly breath in the exhausted air the body just tried to get rid of, enriched by some bacteria- and fungi-colonies that grew on the warm and moist cloth.</p>

<p>How long do I have to wear each mask for before changing to a new one?There is no set time, nor recommended number of masks you should use each day. It all depends on what you are doing.</p>
<p>However, if your mask gets dirty, wet or damaged, or if you touch the inside of it, then you should change to a new one (following the steps above).</p>
<p>When you take it off to eat or drink, you should dispose of the old mask, wash or sanitise your hands, and replace it with a new one once you have finished eating.</p>

        <p>Then I guess you don't need to sterilise masks very often. Because personally, back when I was poor, I didn't go out into shops/clubs/anything that requires masks at the moment very often.
That answers your question I guess. I know poverty myself, and then worked with homeless and poor people for a long time. But the argument "making poor people wear masks is oppressing them" is simply bullshit.</p>

        <p>Very fair point that they would go less places that need them. Still, accessing and maintaining masks is way more of a burden to those who have less means to. Pretty much all measures we have taken have been more of a burden to those with less.</p>

        <p>I'd agree to that if scarfs and such weren't allowed to be used, but since it's not necessary to actually buy masks, I  think the burden is rather small.</p>
<p>By the way, there's a lot of things that I don't agree with regarding all the Corona-restrictions, but I see the masks as a very small inconvenience that might actually help a lot, so I don't really understand why people turn it into such a big issue.</p>

        <p>But wearing a mask isn't for your own protection, it's to protect others from your nasty self! Just as the yellow star was to warn others of your nasty Jewishness, which was treated as a contaminant or contagion just like the rona. Which is little more than a new strain of the cold.</p>

        <p>People seem to not understand the concept of the overton window and shifting it. They think one day everything was normal, and out of nowhere the next day people were getting loaded on trains and the general public was just "sounds good bro." No. People were conditioned over time to accept and even support authoritarian measures little by little. I imagine the early days were similar to what we are seeing, exact details being different, but general idea being the same.</p>

        <p>This. People typically frown upon eugenics now, but back then (in nazi Germany, the US, and many other parts of the world) it was considered to be cutting edge science, which we should all follow for the betterment of humanity. After the holocaust many people opened their eyes and saw that "following the science" could lead to unspeakable horrors if you don't consider the human costs alongside whatever scientists are proposing. We've lost the awareness of how important that is now, and are veering dangerously into an obsession with cleanliness, ie, purity. This is unattainable and dangerous.</p>

        <p>And normies scoff at the idea that population control - another version of eugenics could be imposed upon them while living in a world where a "one child policy" was in effect for decades.  Where eugenists funded abortion clinics.  Where vaccines delivered to 3rd world countries left women sterile.  </p>
<p>It's fucking absurd to trust a government that will happily commit war crimes and kill thousands of other innocent people in other countries, but believe they care about the lives of their own citizens.. because urh.. reasons?  </p>

        <p>I'm sure you guys are tired of me saying this, but everyone needs to read The Road To Serfdom.</p>
<p>Its fairly short and a pdf is available on mises.org if you dont want to buy a copy.</p>
<p>Bonus points if you read Economics In One Lesson after.</p>
<p>And we might be best friends if you read The Law by Bastiat.</p>
<p>All three are so incredibly relevant right now.</p>

        <p>Be very careful not to fall into the same trap, though. If you spend too much time expecting it from one angle, it makes it much easier to surprise you from a different angle. The believers in Nazi ideology accepted the Holocaust because they were expecting it from those they murdered.</p>

<p>It certainly doesn't stop tyranny completely but without guns there is isn't even a theoretical chance, or at best a tiny one. Really dangerous situation to be in.</p>

        <p>I think a major benefit of an armed citizenry is the mentality it fosters. Maybe we aren't well-armed or well-trained citizenry <em>now</em> at this very moment, but perhaps we're more inclined to develop new weapons technology and train in using those tools properly than a nation of unarmed citizens.</p>

        <p>Apart from on here, and one other friend, every single American I know supports what is being done over there. Even wants more to be done. I find it disturbing how quickly Americans I know turned away from freedom of speech, freedom in general and the constitution being so important to them and their country, to that being selfish free-dumbs. Like a switch was flipped. Freedom is now selfish. Wanting freedom makes you a horrible person. </p>
<p>Fear is a powerful weapon.</p>
<p>Freedom is an illusion. It can be taken, and evidently even Americans will roll over and allow governments to do what they have. Induce a little fear and propaganda and you can overpower a gun wielding population. Groupthink, herd mentality, obedience to authority, and compliance are all difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>The true weapon people need to fight this is their brain. The ability to think for themselves, to think critically, to analyse, to question, to recognise manipulation, and etc. In this situation knowledge of how science works (it's not a religion you follow blindly), and most vitally maths and statistics and the ways they can be manipulated and presented is important. Throw a bit of knowledge of the immune system too.</p>
<p>If you have none of that, not even a nuclear weapon would save you.</p>

        <p>Of course you're right about a situation like that. I think it's more of a thing where if it actually came to all out war against the government, armed citizens would band together. We have plenty of guns in this country and if enough got together, it would easily outnumber government forces. I'm sure it still wouldn't end well, but at least we would have a chance unlike countries like the UK or Australia.</p>

&rt;<em>"And so what if they are forcing us?"</em><br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;<strong><em>"so what"</em></strong></p>
<p>It is one thing to be aware that we are forced to to something and can't do much against it. But why would you conclude from that, that it now were okay, or wouldn't matter?</p>
<p>Just bizarre, <em>it matters very much</em> and <em>it is wrong</em> for obvious reasons.</p>

        <p>A part of that is most likely fear of resisting and fear of the consequences of that rebellion.</p>
<p>Many people still fear death so much that they're willing to trade freedoms to preserve their lives. No matter how morally wrong they think what they're observing is, they value their lives and livelihood too much to do anything.</p>
<p>And I think most people are guilty of that and it's just a part of human nature. The difference is how brave you are in surmounting those fears to fight for what's right and how much you feel you have to lose</p>
<p>The person saying "so what" may hate the situation at hand,  but they don't realize that they CAN do something about it, but they choose not to because they don't want to lose their lives or what they have.</p>

        <p>It takes a lot less for people to becoming fanatical enough to want their so-called enemies to die.  I'm pretty horrified although I've always suspected that there wasn't anything particularly about the German people that made them go along with Hitler.  Circumstances determine people's morale compass.</p>

<p>No fascist will campaign with a "If you put me in power I will murder millions and millions of people". They all had some "the ends justify the means"-propaganda to veil their horrible crimes in.</p>
<p>Though even if many people realize what is happening, what can they realistically do to stop fascists with millions of heavily armed enforcers who will do whatever gruesome atrocity they are told to do? Especially if they themselves are unarmed.</p>

        <p>Yeah, of 100% of the supporters of these oversteps I've wondered how many are closeted against it but fear the social repercussions of speaking out.</p>
<p>I've talked to quite a few. They wear their masks, pretend to think it helps, follow the guidelines etc but when we're alone they admit it's all show and a total overreaction and overreach.</p>
<p>It was actually a common discussion with my husband in the beginning as to how we would navigate this for the sake of our children. Do we stand up and fight or do we go along quietly for their safety/social standing ?</p>
<p>We've chosen to fight and along the way we'll do everything we can to keep them safe. People like to act as if that's a dramatic thing to say but there are people literally being attacked, arrested, put on house arrest for not wearing masks or for not social distancing. Once a half assed vaccine exists I have zero doubt anymore that they'll make it legally required.
All of our family live in different states than us and I've spent the entire year wondering when the hammer is going to drop and people are not even allowed to freely move between states - it's already happening in some parts but so far none of ours. </p>
<p>Do supporters not see that or do they not care ?</p>
<p>I'm actually terrified sometimes when I leave my house with my kids not because of some virus. Thankfully for <em>us</em> all that has happened is some dirty looks, whispering, or one store employee acting all shocked I just (politely) blew her off. (That's a long story, usually I'd just not shop there but her specific comment pissed me off so fuck her, I shopped mask free).</p>

<p>It doesn't take extraordinary or unusual people to go along with fascism and mass murder; it takes extraordinary and unusual people to <em>resist</em> it. Compliance, conditioning, and eventual enthusiastic participation are the norm response.</p>

        <p>History is repeating and the parallels are everywhere.</p>
<p>Compare the Reichstag fire decree in 1933 that Hitler pushed for when he was chancellor to what laws are being passed in Victoria.</p>
<p>Unfortunately with mass poverty and economies collapsing, soon the vast majoity of people will be at their governments mercy. They can mandate any rule to the basic necessities people need to survive. Not got the covid pass? Not got the vaccine? No food or state money for you!</p>
<p>Ignorance will be peoples downfall. They don't want to understand history. They don't want to understand economics. They don't want to understand what mass poverty will do to a country.</p>

        <p>It's always about "care." WW2 and the Holocaust was all undertaken by the cause of taking care of your family and taking care of the nation of Germany. It just got worse and worse from there. Somehow sticking up for Germany meant getting rid of those who somehow weren't the right ones. The same thing is happening now. Who's "right" is where the line is drawn and right is always subjective so the side you don't like is "wrong" and if you don't stick up for the option for people to be wrong in opinion or in language then you demonize them. </p>
<p>Now of course you don't have to stick up for anyone's right to violate you, attack you or hurt you.</p>

<p>also they can just claim, that you "died from covid-19",  in those death/work/prison camps, so that will be another way to reduce the population/remove anyone questioning the kakistocracy.</p>
<p>also yes i  wish we had free access to guns here too. btw after the last few decades they created a bunch of false flag attacks to  remove guns from the public like the well known australian one the port arthur massacre or the christ church shooting in new zealand.</p>
<p>and just in case this gets understood wrong: false flag does NOT mean, that no one died during it.</p>
<p>so yeah i'm with u my friend. we gotta resist, fight back and get our freedoms back, because there is no other alternative. </p>
<p>today it's the slave muzzle, tomorrow the  slave camps, vaccine passports, 100% digital tracking of everything you do and forced injections.</p>
<p>on the little upside, the amount of people getting the scam and speaking up and resisting and waking their friends up is massive beyond anything, that happened before.</p>

<p>Very good point. Then "the virus" may become actually deadly.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;on  the little upside, the amount of people getting the scam and speaking  up and resisting and waking their friends up is massive beyond anything,  that happened before.</p>
<p>Yes that's the only thing left that causes some hope, because if you really woke up to it you distrust the whole system, and I see so many comments on mainstream videos calling it out as it is.</p>

        <p>I'm Australian and I've been to the US 4 times now. It's been my genuine home. I have never, ever belonged in Australia, I just don't have the right mindset for this country, whereas the minute I set foot in America, I just knew I belonged.. The most relatable feeling I had to the country was just how at ease people were with speaking their mind and giving a damn about freedom of speech and freedom in general, a quality that I personally feel has always been lacking in Australia, long before covid started. But to see the state America is in, and how quickly people are bending to this insanity, is just heartbreaking for me to witness. It won't ever stop me going back there though but man is it disheartening.</p>

        <p>Relax my friend. Take a moment to examine how ridiculous this sounds. We were already in a Brave New World dystopia before this. We were already under control.  </p>
<p>The point of the lockdowns is to give average joes a feeling of being apart of history. Literally nothing of note has happened since 9/11 lol. Personally I think Alex Jones-esque conspiracies like these are peddled to paint the right as a bunch of lunatics, so the left has something to swing at. No need to worry. Things will calm down after the election.</p>

        <p>I feel like at this point you are becoming what you hate the most; doomers.</p>
<p>You criticize them for thinking that a pandemic is the worst thing ever, but how is this any different? Youre reaching really hard here, like ‚Äúgun shaped temp scanner pointed at your head‚Äù, really?</p>

        <p>It's no joke. Right now sensors in my mouse are measuring the heat and sweat from my hand. That data is being sent to a central control room run by Nazi tyrants so they can monitor my status. You see, covid is a plot to herd people into their homes so they need to keep tabs on us. That's only phase 1. Phase 2 is the installation of robot nazi tyrant spies in towns to track us. Then the death squads will start. I been there.</p>
