        <p>People who haven‚Äôt been negatively affected by the shutdowns (and who can‚Äôt be bothered to open their minds and look around for stories of those suffering from the restrictions) have no right to tell others who have been affected how to feel about them and how to live their lives. I‚Äôm so glad working from home is your dream come true and you have a high income and every amenity you could ever want in your mansion. But stop telling me that we can‚Äôt let restaurants fully reopen and we can‚Äôt let kids attend schools in person because of your irrational need for 100% ‚Äúsafety.‚Äù</p>

        <p>I don‚Äôt know if this helps: I‚Äôm high earning and I‚Äôve worked from home for years (and that <em>has</em> always been a dream of mine). And I haven‚Äôt been affected economically from the shut downs. My industry kept on chugging. </p>
<p>And I was against this shit from day ONE. All of it. Every freaking insane part of it. I am trying to find protests to march in, I refuse to wear a mask. I signed my (oregon) governor‚Äôs recall petition. I just donated to Unlock Michigan. I‚Äôm trying to fight this.</p>

        <p>The classist bullshit no less.</p>
<p>I spent some time teaching in an inner city.  Where a lot of kids didn't have computers.  </p>
<p>The lack of social mobility for people who are already living in poverty is going to become staggering.  And it's all a lot of "well, at least they don't have COVID". </p>
<p>Well, at least those people don't have perspective.  Oh...wait.</p>

        <p>I invited a friend over for dinner, but had to cancel when she said she wouldn't be coming inside, because she's "just being careful". I'm not serving dinner on a stoop while we get bit up by mosquitoes. We're both young healthy people with cushy jobs and no risk factors. Another friend came over several weeks ago but kept her mask on between bites when I had her over for dinner. Seeing people act so deluded is depressing me big time. I know nothing will change til next year üò• At least I have my family, who are on board with squashing the new normal BS</p>

        <p>So I won't go into too much detail over it here... But my spouse and I have had the biggest fight ever, and while most of it wasn't over the lockdown, it was still a huge factor in it. He just feels miserable over the direction life is taking, and fears we may never be able to start a family or truly be happy again. Nothing I say seems to comfort him. </p>
<p>He also blames me, often, whenever people confront us or we otherwise get into trouble when being unmasked outdoors. "Why can't we just wear the fucking masks?" He asks me, and I tell him, "I...just don't think it's justified", Then he'll typically reply with something like, "Oh, but you'd rather we get people spitting at us, taking swings at us, and calling the police? I don't want to have to deal with this <strong>shit</strong>!" </p>
<p>Things have been sour between us for months now, and our marriage is slowly crumbling. It's not just the lockdown, but it is added a ton of stress to both of us that tends to end in us arguing. Not sure what we can do about it. It doesn't help that his job has been on the chopping block for a while, and we fear losing it, and thus our brand new house. I feel like garbage, and I'm just...tired.</p>

        <p>You need to realize that this is EXACTLY the point of the measures our government is taking. He needs to honestly grow up and realize that he's supposed to be the man of the house. What those little impish miscreants think of him means NOTHING.</p>
<p>I imagine it would improve your morale as well, seeing him properly stand for himself.</p>

        <p>To be completely honest, I just feel exhausted. I've said this many times on here before. I've been fighting this since March. March. Even back when most skeptics were terrified, and believing the lies being fed to them. As you can imagine, I got a lot of flack since the get-go, people telling me I was an idiot and "crazy" and much worse. </p>
<p>Then my neighbors began to harass me because I'm the black sheep that isn't in lockstep with the panic. Then others have joined in. I've been insulted, harassed, had threats launched at me, near physical assaults, had cops called on me, cars revving at me as if they want to run me over, and so on. </p>
<p>On top of that, my very few friends and my spouse have basically become fucked up as a result of this bullshit, and now I barely talk to anybody. Everyone around me is miserable, either out of fear or because the lockdowns have ruined their lives.</p>
<p>Couple that with some of the awful shit people in this sub, and from outside subs, have said and done to me... Yeah. I just don't have much fight left in me. I want this to end so badly. One way or another. Unfortunately, I don't see the tides turning in spite of the insistance by others tha it has. </p>
<p>I just hate everything and everyone right now, a sentiment my spouse also seems to share. I'm just trying to fight that feeling while he has succumbed to it.</p>

        <p>So sorry to hear about this, you are not alone, please remember that.</p>
<p>You need to get away for some time outside, away from people if you can. I felt miserable, and now i try and get away outside every weekend if i can. Nothing like a steep uphill hike to get your mind off things. Ideally you and your partner should do this together (or alone if you feel its better). Its important to refresh in any way you can, you'll just burn out otherwise.</p>

        <p>Oh I‚Äôm so, so sorry. It really feels in so many ways that there‚Äôs no more oxygen left in the room. I feel a husk of my former self. All my significant other and I have time and energy for is comforting each other, and sometimes not even that. Putting one foot in front of the other, and just hoping it ends soon.

        <p>He doesn't wear a mask. Neither of us do when we're outside ibn public (indoors, we basically do nowadays). But he feels like he's doing so at my insistance, and is getting tired of the harassment. He's anti-lockdown, but he's sick of having no peace.</p>

        <p>Maybe I didn‚Äôt express myself clearly. I meant, why can‚Äôt your husband go ahead and wear a mask if it makes him more comfortable, while you go without? Just because you‚Äôre a couple doesn‚Äôt mean you have to present a united front on every issue.</p>

        <p>Oh, sorry, I misread your comment. And he does sometimes (particularly recently). But he usually doesn't because he also doesn't like them, he hates the "New Normal", and he wants to support me. However, he is upset and frustrated by the hostility. I can't say I'm not either, I just try to ignore it all... I am hitting my breaking point lately.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôd say for the health or your marriage it might be good to take a step back and give your husband some space to conform for a while for his own mental health. My SO often wears masks when I won‚Äôt just because he doesn‚Äôt want to be hassled. I think it‚Äôs dumb but I‚Äôm not going to make an issue out of it if he doesn‚Äôt hassle me to put one on. </p>
<p>There‚Äôs just so much stress from all of this shit right now and I think in this instance it‚Äôs best to focus on helping your husband with his mental wellbeing.</p>

        <p>Wow. Doing yard work with a mask? Looking down for any period of time with a mask is really, really hard.  These must be people without glasses. Looking straight ahead and jogging would be easier. But this is crazy to think about all the masks where you live.</p>

        <p>Yes, it is. Think about this for a second: How creepy is it to go out and see no one smiling, laughing or even remotely expressing themselves.</p>
<p>Imagine how strange it would be to go outside and see everyone wearing, say, an anonymous mask. No expressions of sadness, love or contentment. Just the same creepy smile everywhere you go with dead and demoralized eyes on every person you see.</p>
<p>This mandate is, in every sense, an attack on free expression. It's literal dehumanization, and to not understand that means that you yourself, are a SUBHUMAN monster.</p>

        <p>.... I see a lot of people smiling and laughing. What kinda creepy-ass town do you live in? </p>

<p>Except... no one is wearing an anonymous mask.  </p>
<p>This mandate is not an attack on free expression. Saying you literally cannot smile would be.   </p>

        <p>Seeing everyone in masks makes me more afraid than CV ever has.</p>
<p>I swear, people took the guidance and went extreme with it.</p>
<p>Masks should be <em>only</em> for when you can't "social distance" (that term makes me want to retch).   Which for most people, most of the time is not a problem in the least.</p>
<p>Also, I'm tired of people acting like the US is some sort of great monolith when it comes to all of this.  People in rural areas are sitting around thinking, "I have no idea what the hell is going on, but people in cities need to calm the f- down".  </p>
<p>Hell, I've repeated it ad nauseum: I live in a suburb that went maskless for months.  The hell are masks supposed to do <em>now</em>?  Especially with the fact that I keep finding them on the sidewalk when I go out running (which I do maskless and if anyone says anything to me about that, they will get told off), which tells me whatever "good" they're supposed to do is counteracted by the fact that people aren't using them the way they're supposed to be used.  </p>
<p>It's all insanity.  </p>
<p>The only upside at the moment is, I'm taking some leave next week and leaving the state.  I don't believe this will be a problem, but I do fear going out on my nice relaxing vacation and seeing masks everywhere.</p>

        <p>Same here. Conservative suburb. Masks in grocery store went from 40% in April to 20% in June. Then we got a mask mandate and businesses are posting "NO EXCEPTIONS" We did school supply pickup and I was the only one not wearing a mask in line. Outdoors. Took a vacation in Northern Idaho end of August and it was great to feel alive again.</p>

        <p>&rt;Seeing everyone in masks makes me more afraid</p>
<p>I despise it too. There's just something...wrong about seeing this masked horde of zombies doing nothing but looking at their phones, if anything. Just completely ignoring each other. It makes me uncomfortable on a visceral level.</p>
<p>It doesn't help that I'm on the autism spectrum and had to basically train myself to recognize facial cues effectively and the sensory issues would make holding me down and forcing a muzzle on my face a legitimate torture technique.</p>

        <p>My ears rang.  I knew that was a sound of a sanctimonious preach coming in my direction.</p>
<p>&rt;Why? It's perfectly normal in other countries when people may risk infecting others...</p>
<p>There's no reason to believe that if people don't take precautions other than just putting on a mask that masks actually work.  In fact, most people just do it because they don't want to be harassed or assaulted for not doing it.</p>
<p><strong>THAT SHOULD SCARE YOU.</strong></p>
<p>It should scare you because people have taken it upon themselves to be a vigilante law enforcement agency when mask-wearing isn't even a law.  It's a mandate.  So, bite me with this "perfectly normal" BS.  It's not normal.  It shouldn't be normal.  If it was normal, we would have evolved to have natural face coverings rather than <strong><em>functioning immune systems.</em></strong></p>
<p>And by the way, since it's not normal in most countries, it's not normal period.  </p>
<p>There's a reason for that.  Ask Sweden. </p>
<p>&rt;You must be from a rural area. In cities, it's near impossible. That's why population density is a huge statistic in terms of transmission.</p>
<p>There is a little thing out there called "the suburbs".  I'm sure you've heard of it.  But thanks for the presumption.  By the way, I don't care about transmission.  I care about hospitalizations and deaths.  Which there aren't many of around here.  </p>
<p>&rt;The fact of the matter is that masks do work, and we are in the middle of a growing epidemic. It may be uncomfortable for a short bit, but much less uncomfortable than having 200K more Americans die.</p>
<p>"The fact of the matter is..."</p>
<p>Yep, sanctimonious.</p>
<p>Here are some other "facts" for you: where I live, transmission is relatively stable.  There aren't a whole lot of deaths, not just where I live, but pretty much anywhere, and those who do die, are immunocompromised.</p>
<p>Is it sad that people die?  Yes.  Do people die anyway?  Also yes.  Can we stop death forever?  Have you lost your mind?</p>
<p>It's jerks like you that come here and judge us because we have a higher risk tolerance but you demand we live at yours.  That's not acceptable.  Not for a virus that is fatal for <strong><em>less than 1% of people</em></strong><em>.</em>  </p>
<p>And since there are no long-term studies, we can't be concerned about long-term effects when the world needs to keep turning and people need to keep doing things to make sure the world still functions.  </p>
<p>&rt;The fact of the matter is that masks do work, and we are in the middle of a growing epidemic. It may be uncomfortable for a short bit, but much less uncomfortable than having 200K more Americans die.</p>
<p>Ah yes, people might die.  That's the argument.  The highly emotional argument that <strong>people could die</strong><strong><em>.</em></strong>  Well, color me green and call me a turtle.  People can die from just about anything.  Why are we deciding to stop life despite the fact that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The world has never shut down for a pandemic and</li>
<li>Historically speaking, "greater good" measures never end well.  Never.  </li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;Do you hear how irrational this sounds? What if I just rephrase to "I do fear going out on my nice relaxing vacation and seeing black people everywhere." What does it matter to you what other people are doing if it doesn't actually affect you. On the other hand fearing going out when people are 40-60% more likely to transmit a disease that kills people is actually concerning.</p>
<p>No, I sound perfectly rational that many people around me have made <strong>the choice</strong> to blindly follow a mandate without thinking, and then a few crazies among them feel they have the right to <strong>verbally and physically harass people who don't comply</strong>.  </p>
<p>That is in no way comparable to race and that is simply a bad faith argument.  Your argument sucks.  You have nothing.  You lose.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  </p>
<p>And here I am, trying to relax, wondering if the mask gestapo is going to come get me if I don't follow their petty little rules over something that...</p>
<p>IF THEY ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT IT, THEY SHOULD STAY HOME THEMSELVES AND MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS.</p>
<p>Let me make this clear for your sanctimonious ass: I would not harass anyone for wearing a mask. But it is strongly encouraged, or at least acceptable do so in the opposite case.</p>
<p>The fact that people now do this <strong>should frighten EVERYONE.</strong>  </p>
<p>I have no idea why the idea of the world that is just following without thinking and is whipped up in absolute hysteria and me noticing it going on is somehow irrational.  I think it's gaslighting on your part to try and make me think that these are the actions of right-thinking rational people.</p>
<p>It wouldn't have gone down like this 100 years ago.  Not this badly.  </p>
<p>You act like you get to have it both ways: that here's this pandemic, but you get to condemn people for going out and at least attempting to enjoy themselves (which sometimes counts as going to a restaurant and taking off the mask, thereby making it entirely ineffective.  </p>
<p>No one has yet explained to me how that makes a lick of sense because <em>it simply does not</em>) because we've decided we're tired of living in fear of a disease that is barely more lethal than the flu, of open-ended restrictive measures that nobody seems to have any way of explaining why they're in place or what the conditions are for when they will be lifted, and are awfully convenient in an election year where the opposition party will literally burn the country down to remove the sitting president.</p>
<p>I consider THAT irrational.  Because until you come correct with a flowchart of how all of this is supposed to work now that you have had more than half a year to figure it out, any more restrictive measures for the healthy are irrational and perpetuated to inspire continual fear.  Quarantine the immunocompromised.  The rest of us should go on living as if the world hasn't changed.  </p>
<p>This isn't the way the world should be, but people love their little authoritarian bubbles for some bizarre reason.</p>
<p>And again...<strong>you should be afraid of that.</strong></p>
<p>But you do you, O wise one who walked into a thread that was clearly marked for venting.  Conform and be well from atop that high horse of yours.</p>

        <p>I essentially had a breakdown over the weekend. I‚Äôm (legitimately) homebound because of the wildfire smoke, which is like nothing I‚Äôve ever seen before, and it very much feels like we are in war and are huddling in bomb shelters üò≠</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been fighting this since March, so it‚Äôs been a long haul. And we are going mask free now, and it‚Äôs liberating but taxing. </p>
<p>I screamed and cried for the first time in months. I have so much grief and rage. I‚Äôve worked for 10 years to get financially secure, so I could start a family and give my kids a good life that I didn‚Äôt have. We are now at the point biologically where we will have to freeze eggs, to hopefully buy us some time. I can‚Äôt bring a new life into this madness. </p>
<p>It feels like everything has been taken. Like everything is gone. I wonder how  much fight I have left in me. I‚Äôm so angry and sad most of the time. And I don‚Äôt want to go out because everyone looks like a drooling zombie to me and I can‚Äôt even bear to look now.</p>

        <p>I just need to vent about schools.</p>
<p>Ou kids attend a local private school, and at first we were so happy they announced five day in-school for students.  But now that it's been a couple of weeks I'm noticing both my kids dislike school and don't want to go.   There are so many rules in places about masks, distancing, plexiglass shields, not moving anywhere, etc, etc, that they are basically living in a prison.  My daughter, who used to be so excited about school and was excelling in everything now hates it and doesn't want to go.  My son is just starting Kindergarten so this is his first experience in class all-day and it's not starting out on the right foot.</p>
<p>The worst part is, I feel so powerless to do anything about it, beyond just pulling them out of school altogether.  The faculty are so scared that they are letting unsubstantiated fear drive every decision.  Nobody is looking at the actual risk to kids (extremely low), or the lack of science around asymptomatic spread, or anything for that matter.  They just parrot the official narrative about masks and distancing and pay no regard to the tangible psychological and emotional damage this is doing to all the kids.  Every single communication about this crap ends with "for the safety of the kids" to justify all of it.</p>

        <p>If you are able, take your children out of school. Think about it. It is not school anyway, but a morbid experiment to see how they can condition children to no longer experience what it is to be human. Maybe talk to other parents, and start a group. My 8th grader is virtual now. And if they go back with masks &amp; all the other bullshit, I am homeschooling. No way would I muzzle my son. I hope you can find another option.</p>

        <p>I‚Äôll join with the others here and shill a homeschool/tutoring co-op since you can afford private school. While my oldest misses being at school and DL sucks, I think I‚Äôd choose this over in person hygiene theater. They will not be attending next school year if any of this garbage is still in place next fall.</p>

        <p>If you are in a city, there might be a homeschooling centre or something like that which might be an alternative. I teach at one in NYC and we plan to be in person starting the first week of October despite Cuomo still refusing to open up fully.</p>

        <p>I went to the grocery store and pulled my mask down once I got through the front door. No one said anything. Also no one said anything about my 8yo who came in sans mask. It‚Äôs the little things. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm also making a conscious effort to not hand sanitize all the time. I figure if I do encounter the ol‚Äô Rona my T-cells could use a little exercise.</p>

        <p>So important to never use the sanitizers. Imagine what's in them. At the entrance of the grocery stores it's such a peculiar sight watching the idiots "prepare" to go into combat with the Rona. The spraying down of the cart and the excessive rubdown of the cart is psychotic.</p>

        <p>The local minor league hockey team I used to have season tickets to sent a survey to fans asking about their expectations for a safe season. For some reason I can‚Äôt figure out, two of the questions are ‚Äúwhat do you plan to do when going to public places‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen the governor permits all businesses to operate under normal circumstances (my commentary: as if Wolf would ever let that happen!), what activities will you feel comfortable doing?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know why the hockey team cares what I will do at the grocery store or if I‚Äôll feel comfortable taking a vacation when they are asking about having a safe experience at the arena. But OK. </p>
<p>I plan on taking the survey and telling them I will not buy tickets until all restrictions are lifted. I have no doubt all the sheep in the fanbase will demand social distancing, masks and gloves for all employees and e-ticketing because God forbid they look at anyone. And like anything else, they will get every demand while people like me go ignored.</p>

        <p>Guys. Is there anywhere we can still safely discuss anti-masks matters? Reddit and Facebook are totally censoring any group (e.g. subreddit) that clearly oppose the use of masks. However, my country for example is clearly against them and I fully support them in this decision.</p>

        <p>From what I've seen, NJ is really mask and "New Normal" supportive. Is Maryland on their quarantine list, if so, there is a chance you could get pulled over, but I haven't really seen anyone talk about this happening. I'm in PA, and have gone in and out of NJ with no problems, though PA is not on their quarantine list.</p>

        <p>Okay, then they probably won't pull you over or anything. Like I said, though, they do mandate masks, and they have people over there who police people without them on.</p>

        <p>Question for the group: a user recently brought up a suggestion regarding the default sort method for this discussion thread going forward.  The current default sort for this thread is the same as the subreddit default, which is "best", but I'm wondering what people think.  The options are best, top, new, and controversial, or we could always just put it in contest mode, which randomizes it.  Help inform this decision-making and let me know what you think.  This change would affect the weekly thread only.</p>
