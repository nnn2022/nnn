        <p>Maybe not a popular post or maybe the mods will delete this...but one thing -</p>
<p>Communications is mostly non-verbal.  Now we have even less non-verbal - with masks covering our facial expressions.</p>

        <p>Masks are the stupidest thing I’ve ever lived through. I still can’t believe so many people don’t have a problem with this. I though for sure hot and humid 100 degree days would do it. I though that those kids dying in PE class would do it. I had thought that the hoodie season plus masks would scare enough people we’ll see. Someone in another thread pointed out how masks on children make child traffic easier and kids have a 66,000% higher chance of being trafficked than catching cv. Then there’s mask breath. And skin breakouts. Dental problems. Micro fibers in the lungs and micro molds in the fibers. There’s that study about how kids were more likely to steal Halloween candy behind masks, and the one where college students dropped their inhibitions when their identities were covered. Masks bring out the anonymous troll in real life. It’s become a witch hunt with tattle-tale-ing and public shaming and all but burning those who don’t at the stake in order to force this thing on everyone’s face with no say, no choice and no other option and no end in sight. To what end? A magical vaccine that has no side effects? And if you don’t take it you’re an anti science anti vax trump humpin’ meth smokin bottle rocket blastin toothless yee-haw and you deserve to have your kids taken away from you and your home raided, you job forfeited and you may be arrested if you so much as complain or even plan a to complain.</p>

        <p>Cotton mask are equally as bad if not worse. They're prone to getting moist and mold building up which you in turn inhale regularly depending on how long you wear them. The outside also gets extremely contaminated by you adjusting or pulling it up or just instinctually touching it as you would your face which you also inhale through the large pores/holes in cotton woven materials. Washing it after use wears down the fabric causing the holes to grow larger rendering them even more ineffective than they were prior to washing it. By wearing a cotton mask you are trading one set of problems for another. The optimal solution for your health is to not wear one at all.</p>
