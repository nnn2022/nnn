<p>Boom of infections in Aosta. And Covid departments full, last Sunday. But it was a technical problem with an instrument in the analysis laboratory of the Parini hospital. Numerous tests were found to be "false positives". The incident took place last Sunday. At least twenty patients, already hospitalized, were therefore transferred to the Covid wards on the same evening. Only Monday morning was their negativity discovered and now they are isolated in other wards. The false positives led to a boom in infected and hospitalized patients reported in the Covid bulletin of the Crisis Unit on Monday. The failure was caused by the instrument being switched off, which was reset and was not "re-calibrated" by the technicians: almost all the samples tested positive. According to the bulletin, in fact, out of 68 reports tested last Sunday, 61 gave a positive result. Some of these belong to people who were hospitalized in various Parini wards and who were therefore urgently transferred to the Covid wards. Yesterday all the swabs that gave a negative result were redone and they were placed in quarantine waiting to understand if they caught the virus during their stay in the wards dedicated to the coronavirus. Many protests have arisen from patients themselves and relatives.</p>
<p>Dear doomers, before going "it's the antimaskers fault if we're in this messsss reeee!!", please use your fucking brain and open up that duckduckgo search.</p>
