    <strong>There is nothing to be afraid of, we have already won.</strong>
    <p><p>This is going to be a (long) post rooted in spirituality, and it won't be for everybody, it will seem insane to some, but I think in times like these it is helpful to have some sense of a spiritual perspective.</p>
<p>If you'd like to read it as fiction, that's okay too!</p>
<p>I have been immersed in spiritual work for well over a decade. Although it doesn't really matter, you're either awake, have access to the sixth sense that allows you to wake up, or you will not wake up in this lifetime. (NPC's), and that's okay too.</p>
<p>As we can see, there are 16 year old's who see clearly what is going on, and people with two PHD's in Theology and Bio-chem (and everything else) that will nearly fight to the death for these absurd narratives. There is really no correlation.</p>
<p>That includes spirituality. There are spiritual teachers who have made millions of dollars and built empires who have proven themselves to be fraudulent and completely asleep. (Vishen of MindValley) </p>
<p>Now, from a spiritual perspective, here's what's going on. (and take it as you will, this is MY perspective, but I believe it with every ounce of my soul).</p>
<p>The planet is transitioning to a higher density of consciousness. Think of it as 3D vs 5D. We have been living in 3D, and many believe the actual shift to 5D happened around 2012, and 2020/2021 is the crescendo. So for a quick comparison of 3d vs 5d:</p>
<p><strong>3D</strong> is seeing yourself as a separate being who just does things. Largely like cattle. Doing tasks because thats the work for today.  A conversation is just a conversation, words being spoken, nothing deeper.</p>
<p><strong>5D</strong> is being an awakened being who understands (maybe at a deeper level) a conversation is not just a conversation, but a multi-dimensional energy exchange. 5D is waking up to the fact that we create through out inward intention, and doing things is the effect not the cause. You also see yourself as a part of the whole thing, deeply interconnected and that the tiniest decision is like a pebble dropped in an ocean that becomes a wave that ultimately impacts the world. (even if just in a subtle way)</p>
<p>This might sound pretty weird, but let's take a look at the state of the world.</p>
<p>Just take a simple walk around a cafe or a park where people are reading. Take a look at the books people are reading, 70%+ percent are self help, spiritual, Power of Now, The Alchemist, etc. These themes have been blowing up in the last decade. <strong>People are</strong> <strong><em>FEELING</em></strong> <strong>this call to something higher, and they are reaching for it.</strong> It isn't intellectual, it's a feeling in your gut and soul. Something bigger is going on here. </p>
<p>Look beyond the media control mechanisms, and you will see and feel that the world is waking up. We are all reaching for higher meaning. We're reaching for greater love and connection. This is why (SOME) stories resonate so much. They are speaking from this higher perspective, and are souls are crying out: <em>Yes, this is the truth.</em> That's what resonance is.</p>
<p>This is all because the planet's transition to 5D <strong>has already happened.</strong></p>
<p>Now really take a look at the world. Look at the absolute hysteria and confusion of those still trying to make sense of 3D. Unfortunately, they may not wake up and will live very confusing lives until death. This is also why the control mechanisms of Government, Media, Pharma, the Education System is becoming crystal clear to many of us. This is the final push. It's like a disease that has always been there now coming to the surface of the skin. Clear as day. The NPC's are perfect soldiers for this old world. It is all they have or understand, they will cling to it for dear life.</p>
<p>This is all to say that <strong>since we are now anchored in 5D, 3D</strong> <strong><em>does not work anymore.</em></strong></p>
<p>And here is why that is great news. </p>
<p>The evolution of consciousness does not go backwards. <strong>We are there, it's done.</strong> More and more people will wake up, the control mechanisms will become more and more clear, and this elites game built on fear will collapse spectacularly.  Once you wake up, you do not go back to sleep. and NOBODY is moving the other direction. It's impossible. As time goes on, our side gets bigger and there's gets smaller. Each time they push, more wake up. It's really a beautiful thing to witness.</p>
<p><strong>The elites are masters of the 3D. If you are awake, reading this and resonating with these words, understand something, you are SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL than them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>They know it, and that's why they're desperate.</strong></p>
<p>This is really the last stand for them. It's a war on the human spirit. It's a war on individual sovereignty. That is what they fear the most.</p>
<p><em>When Zeus had Prometheus create humans to be his playthings, his biggest fear was not that they would rise up and overthrow the Gods, it was that they would wake up to the point where they realize they no longer need the Gods.</em></p>
<p>So what do we do? Understand deeply: <strong>They have no power over you.</strong> Their energy source is attention and compliance. Take both away, and you've done your part. Also, it would do everyone good to go inward and really ask the big questions in your solitude. Why am I here? Is there something more?</p>
<p>Believe me when I say, you are so much more powerful than you've been led to believe, you are worthy and valuable beyond measure. Who you really are is hidden beneath the prison of societal constructs. It's all just illusion to keep you small and scared.</p>
<p>But really, you don't have to do anything, because it's already done. It's the inevitable next stage of our evolution. As I said, it's a beautiful thing to witness. Even the NPC's serve such a grand purpose, they are here to help wake us all up by the intensity of their contrast. Without them, we wouldn't see it so clearly.</p>
<p>The final thing I'll say is something I believe to always keep in mind: <strong>Truth is not a concept. It is a knowing deep in your soul. This next stage of our evolution is largely a feeling journey. Trust your heart and gut and soul, more than ever. They are not leading you astray, they will always tell the truth.</strong></p></p>

        <p>We haven't won shit and we've lost a lot. We'll win after we break up the global banks and invest firms, do away with the British monarchy, strip the US political parties of the ability to finance candidates, national the pharmaceutical companies and hold dozens if not hundreds of world leaders, bankers and corporate executives accountable by seizing their assets under civil forfeiture, putting them on trial and sending them to the same hole they stuck Julian assange.</p>

        <p>Beautiful. This summarizes what I have been thinking about a lot lately. I keep feeling this incredible vibration running through my body, like a chakra activation, but “Truth” keeps appearing in my mind.  It has been keeping me sane and strong. Truth and Love will prevail. Thank you for posting.</p>
