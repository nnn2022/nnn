    <strong>Questions from the perspective of myself (pro-mask etc)</strong>
    <p><p>Hi! So I don't really have much of an opinion about Covid although I know I probably should. As it goes I'd say I'm more pro-mask and pro-social distancing, that's just my opinion as I've known people to have been ill with the virus. In addition wearing masks has overall really helped with my anxiety, I'll probably get quite a lot of backlash for this but I've always been curious why there's been such a debate about lockdown. From my experience anti-maskers have been kinda aggressive about lockdown, I'm sure this is just a minority of people and most have perfectly valid views (such as my own) but idk I guess there's always been such friction between the two "sides" if you will lots of the different arguments have been lost in translation and anger i guess. Basically I've been wanting to find out why so many people are anti-lockdown, my family are very opposed to lockdown but when trying to convince me to follow their beliefs theyre often quite aggressive and patronising about it so its never been a conversation I've ever really enjoyed discussing. So I suppose what I'm asking for is a summary of why people are anti-lockdown but perhaps in a form that's friendly and in a more open style? If so that'd be really interesting and whilst my opinion may not change hopefully I'll be more educated on the differing opinions :) tldr; why are so many people anti-lockdown as I just want everyone to be safe and get along lol</p></p>

        <p>What do you mean by why are we anti-lockdown? Bro, we want to live our lives like normal people not be locked up at home like some animals. That's it. That's all it really is. Anti/Pro-lockdown doesn't exist. It's either you want to live your life like before or live in a new normal. End of story.</p>

        <p>Maybe I phrased it wrong then, I in my country we're in lockdown so we've been advised to stay at home although many are opposed to this and are self-proclaimed "anti-lockdown". I wasn't aware that there was another term, sorry!</p>

        <p>Haha it's okay. I'm a foreigner too, no worries.
Maybe I came on a little too strong but you get what I'm trying to say. Many of us here understand the science of COVID and know it's really not that dangerous the MSM paints it out to be especially if you're under 60 years old. Your chances of even having any of the symptoms are already low let alone dying because of it. Throw in some working out and a really healthy diet in that mix and you're basicly COVID proof. With all of that said, lockdowns just don't make sense. If you really care about the old people that much sure they can stay inside with no contact whatsoever. Isolate them, why not. If that's what they want that's fine by me. But I don't want that for me. And I wont do that myself because shit wont happen if I get COVID. That's why all of us don't support it. It doesn't make sense. Plain and simple.</p>

        <p>First of all, there's no such thing as "anti-maskers".  It would be like if some people started hopping around on one leg calling the people who don't "anti-hoppers".  No, we're just walking, and just showing our faces like we've always done.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you like wearing a mask so much, why didn't you wear one before?  Is it because you weren't told to?</p>

        <p>&rt; In addition wearing masks has overall really helped with my anxiety...</p>
<p>think about what you are saying here... that is a mental illness. what is the source of your 'anxiety' and what does it have to do with me? how does wearing  degrading and dehumanizing face diaper help with your anxiety?</p>
<p>&rt; ... I just want everyone to be safe and get along lol</p>
<p>how does a healthy person wearing a face diaper contribute to 'safety'?</p>

        <p>In 2015, the British Medical Journal published a paper entitled, A Cluster Randomised Trial of Cloth Masks Compared with Medical Masks in Healthcare Workers. The paper was written by nine authors from the University of New South Wales, the University of Sydney, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Vietnam and the Beijing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in China. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of cloth masks to medical masks in hospital health care workers. The study, which was extensive, concluded that the results caution against the use of cloth masks. ‘This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety,’ concluded the authors. ‘Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection.’ And the authors added: ‘...as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for health care workers, particularly in high risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated’.</p>

        <p>Lock-downs disproportionately and very negatively affect economically disadvantaged people and businesses, while increasing the wealth and political capital of wealthy individuals and corporations.</p>

        <p>Of all the issues to be debated, I am more against lockdowns than masks or social distancing (both of which I dont care about all too much).</p>
<p>Essentially, people survive in modern society because of the exchange of goods and services (the economy). From food, to health care, to home repair, to power, all of these things require people to leave their homes and do jobs. </p>
<p>In order to pay for these things, other people need to leave THEIR homes and do work, providing services that may not be essential, but increase the quality of life or efficiency of others.</p>
<p>If we stop all this, production drops. Available goods go down. Quality of life drops and prices go up. If this goes on too long, you end up with food shortages, power outages, internet service outages, lack of access to automotive parts, fuel shortages, and so on. </p>
<p>I think everyone was fine with "two weeks to slow the spread" because the system of interaction by which we live could handle a short delay like that. But a year of suppressed production? That is going to hurt. Hard.</p>
<p>In the meantime, people are suffering. We are social creatures, so eliminating social interaction with others other than angry online discourse leads to major depression issues, high suicide rates, alcoholism, violence, etc. For an introvert, its likely no big deal, but for those of us who thrive on social interaction, its like forcing a musician to go deaf for a year.</p>

        <p>I completely agree, I really want lockdown to end but from the way I see it there would be quite a few positives and negatives in doing that. I really appreciate your response, thankyou! :)</p>
