        <p>Why kill animals when you can just grow their cells in a lab? </p>
<p>Way cheaper, no animal cruelty, no animals taking up our land, etc. Lots of problems with meat.</p>
<p>Meat tastes really good, and I eat it every day, if a meal doesn’t have meat or fish in it, it is just a side dish. I am not even close to beingvegan, but there are definitely less wasteful and more humane ways to produce meat.</p>

        <p>I agree, animals shouldn't suffer. (Like in fur business) however do you know what is that lab made meat? How it is made? What is inside? Do you trust anything Bill invested in ??  People ate animals since beginning of time... Gmo plants causing sicknesses already, i am sorry but i don't trust globalists' lab made meat.  While %1 hunt down whales, sharks, tigers, cutting rainforests, destroying nature ...they force people to not eat chicken because it harms the planet. Who believes that ?  Now they will divide rest of us with things like this.They pretend like they are making a good thing, but it is not really.</p>

        <p>Give me one example of GMO:s causing sickness. </p>
<p>If it is approved to be sold at grocery stores, I will probably buy it. I honestly don’t see why globalists/Bill Gates are such bad things (though you are probably referring to something else). If you don’t want to eat safe, clean meat, fine. I won’t accuse you of killing animals, but it is still a bit unhumane to eat once living animals, when there would be a perfectly fine substitute. </p>
<p>People ate animals since the beginning of time, but not in such excessive amounts. Meat was a rarity, a luxury. Now it has become the norm due to massive factory farms slaughtering countless innocent beings. The meat industry made suffering a good business model. </p>
<p>Ok, here’s a few questions, do you know what they feed these animals? Do you know the drugs and steroids that are fed to the animals? Do you trust the people raising them? Do you trust the meat industry and their investors? Do you know the contributions to climate change? Do you know how they mutilate these animals and cause misery? Do you know that your meat comes from reputable sources? Do you know where your meat comes from and would you like to visit that location? </p>
<p>“They” aren’t dividing us, this subreddit and other social media is. It is a place to fester in your confirmation biases. The same is true for science and vaccine subreddits/groups. No one is innocent here. While the other side may be right (hint, hint), the other sides’ concerns should be considered as well. We need to find a mutual middle ground using proven information. </p>
<p>With social media, you can filter out the other side, and see the others from your side’s distorted view. I’ve seen pro-vaccines people pictured here as all fat, sheeple and unresonable, and on the vaccine subreddits the anti-vax folks all as selfish, stupid Karens. Both sides have the extremes, and they get shared the most. The truth is, most of us are resonable, normal people. It is all too easy to get too riled up and angry towards the opposing side, creating chaos and turning a normal functioning person into a frankly crazy activist one. Most likely, no one is the other’s stereotype. Extremism and political polarisation never lead to good things. </p>
<p>Another key thing is, that there are not much real consequences of posting on social media, anyone can really say anything and someone or something will see it and save it before it would be taken down.</p>
<p>Social media at it’s best, is a place to reunite, share, have fun and communicate with people far away. At it’s worst, a place for extremism to prosper, bad news and all around bad things to be spread all the time, a cause of mental illness and depression and desperation for social validation, misinformation to be spread in an instant and all other kinds of problems causing human suffering and misery. </p>
<p>Oh man, is life complicated sometimes. Kinda went on a rant there but, oh well.</p>

        <p>Sorry but i am supporting everything natural. "If it is approved you will eat" well, many things which known they cause cancer now approved in stores or many things cause obesity also approved such as fast food, chips,ready soups, coke, desserts with full of chemicals etc. all these are approved. People should think for theirselvs not "goverment approved so it must be healthy" . Even kids are obese in these days. Because people are eating less and less natural. 
Gluten intolerance is a real thing now thanks to gmo wheat. (My doctor said this) 
Yes, i know where my meat is coming from. I am buying from a local farmer. 
But it is good for globalists more sick people, more drugs to sell, more money made by drugs + fake meat. One stone 2 birds. Even if it is not made by these people , i am not eating anything unnatural as much as i can.</p>

        <p>No, I never said that everything that is approved is healthy, I meant that lab grown meat will be about the same as meat, maybe even healthier. Meat overall is not that healthy anyways. Just because something is in the shelves of the supermarket, it doesn’t mean it is healthy. It means it’s safe to consume, without toxins.</p>
<p>“Everything natural is good” is just as stupid as “Everything in the supermarket is healthy”. Nature produces countless toxins. When the toxic resins of organic and conventional food were compared (from pesticides and such) the levels were about the same. They were both safe to eat, there were no actual significant health hazards on either one of them. </p>
<p>Not everything non-natural is bad. Not every gmo is bad. For ex. Insulin is a gmo. It used to come from animals, but now we can manufacture it in a lab. It is vital for so many. </p>
<p>“Gluten intolerance is now a thing thanks to gmo wheat” This is simply false. Show me one study that shows this with a clear causal link. I have not seen this anywhere. And yes, if you are allergic to the non-gmo version of a product, you will most likely be allergic to the gmo version as well.</p>
<p>“I am supporting everything natural” and “I am not eating everything unnatural as much as I can”. So ironic, considering you said “People should think for themselves”. You shouldn’t accept everything natural. Maybe you should think a bit for yourself, and not just follow the alternative natural bandwagon. </p>
<p>More sick people -&rt; less citizen productivity -&rt; less taxes &amp; economic progress. More drugs used -&rt; healthy citizens -&rt; more productiveness. They don’t just sell drugs for the sake of it. They sell them to make sick people productive citizens. A simplified way to look at it.</p>

<p>Well... did you look?</p>
<p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3945755/pdf/ITX-6-159.pdf</p>
<p>The causal link is overwhelmingly clear. You could have found this info yourself in less time than it took to ask for it on reddit. Just because you haven't seen it anywhere doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Try looking next time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you're making claims that lab grown meat (which does not even exist yet) is just as good if not better than regular meat, and that regular meat "isn't very healthy" without a single source. How can you be so sure of something that doesn't even exist? Especially when considering that high quality, natural meats have been a staple of the human diet for hundreds of thousands if not millions of years. If modern meat is unhealthy, it's only because the animals were pumped full of antibiotics and GMO, which is indeed unnatural. But the meat itself is not the culprit there.</p>
<p>Also, insulin is not a "GMO"... wtf? Insulin is a <em>hormone</em> produced by the human body which we reverse engineered and learned how to synthesize.</p>
<p>And here's a much more simple and accurate version of your flow chart analysis;</p>
<p>Sickness -&rt; Profits</p>
<p>Occam's Razor, right?</p>
<p>https://www.statista.com/statistics/288538/top-cancer-drugs-based-on-revenue/</p>
<p>As you can see at the link above, chemotherapy profits are measured in the billions per year, and if you take a look at <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15630849/#:~:text=Results%3A%20The%20overall%20contribution%20of,and%202.1%25%20in%20the%20USA.">this study,</a> you will see that chemo treatment is also very ineffective. That looks like selling drugs for the sake of profits to me. How can you say they're trying to make sick people productive citizens when they're charging billions for something that is 2% effective on a good day (which means it saves next to zero lives) and typically makes the patients quality of life worse than it was.</p>
<p>Where are you even getting these completely false ideas from? Are you sure you're not following a bandwagon of your own? Because it seems like you need to think for yourself more. You're projecting more than a movie theatre.</p>

        <p>Did you even read your own source? It literally says: “Here, we propose that glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, Roundup®, is the most important causal factor in this epidemic”.</p>
<p>An herbicide, not GMO. And yes, GMO:s can contribute to more herbicide and pesticide use, since you can make the GMO resistant ro them. But this is a problem in the farming industry itself, not GMO:s.</p>
<p>Sure, I’ll give you a source. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2759737">Meat isn’t healthy.</a> Of course you can eat meat in a balanced diet, people have been doing that for so long, but now it is so easy to come across processed meat that many people risk heart disease or even cancer. NHS advises you eat only ~70g of red and processed meat a day. </p>
<p>https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/meat-nutrition/</p>
<p>Now, this is not the unprocessed meat you might be talking about. Unprocessed meat (not smoked, salted, cured, otherwise preserved) isn’t bad for your arteries and colon, as long as you eat it in moderate amounts. Sorry for the confusion. </p>
<p>The GMO:s and antibiotics fed to animals may make the meat worse, but the real enemy is post-processing. Meat itself is not bad, curing it is. </p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is another problem with modern meat, since it can fuel the creation of superbugs. </p>
<p>Lab grown meat can be made healthier, not saying it will be, should have worded my argument better. We’ll see in the future, but I personally think that lab meat can be made cleaner, safer and healthier. Just speculation right now, but logically thinking about it, I came to this conclusion. In the lab, a lot more is possible.</p>
<p>https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/red-meat-avoid-the-processed-stuff</p>
<p>Modern Insulin is a GMO or GM. Stating otherwise is plain wrong. </p>
<p>https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zx6g87h/revision/2</p>
<p>https://www.livestrong.com/article/5703070-the-pros-cons-of-the-use-of-gmo-insulin/</p>
<p>My point here was that not everything ”GMO” is bad. </p>
<p>There is no cure for cancer. Chemotherapy may not be the best. It may not be effective enough to prescribe. This is only one method, for a disease not yet cured. Very misleading. We have very effecive drugs for the other ton of diseases. Not every treatment is effective, but just because one treatment for a disease very hard to cure is not efficent, dosen’t mean that everything is inefficent and just making profits. 8 billion and lets say maybe another 10 billion (paywall, cant see your data) is a farily small dent in the annual 1.3 trillion global market. </p>
<p>Where are you getting your false ideas from? Are you sure you are not following a bandwagon of your own? Because it seems like you should think for yourself more.</p>

        <p>Regenerative agriculture is still not perfect and would most likely not reverse climate change. It is a good way to farm and still preserve biodiversity. We have to find a very effective way to farm with the land we have, and organic is just not it. I do think gmos and lab grown meat are promising, as they could be made more nutritious and healthy. Some combination of the two would be ideal. Who knows? Maybe the ideal method will be something entirely different.</p>
<p>I don’t think meat allowed us to evolve us to the state we are today, it was actually a luxury up until very recently (~1960’s). </p>
<p>“Lab meat is a step away from humanity in my opinion”. Well, your opinion is very flawed. I have no idea why lab gown meat specifically would be so bad. It is just a humane way of eating animal tissue.</p>

        <p>People have been hunting and eating animals for all of human history. They have been eating things that grow from the ground without chemicals for all of human history. We evolved from a natural environment. Your right though, there are other important things we would need to do to help with climate outside of regenerative agriculture, but I think it is a huge step.</p>
