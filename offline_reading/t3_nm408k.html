    <strong>Genuine question:</strong>
    <p><p>So he’s talking about increasing life expectancy with vaccination to lower the populations numbers?  Reducing the amount of people means less CO2 </p>
<p>This man is a proud eugenicist and this whole thing is a bit confusing. Would love some (non-narcissistic prick) to reply/discuss it. </p>
<p>I can’t find the original video so this must be taken out of context possibly? </p>

        <p>He <em>says</em> he supports vaccines and improved healthcare so less children die, and as a result people in poor parts of the world won't automatically have a ton of kids, since they will stop expecting to lose some during childhood. And then as a result of that, unsustainable population growth will slow, improving poor peoples' lives and also reducing the environmental damage done by humanity.</p>
<p>It's as if he's never seen the sweet smile of a child.</p>

        <p>I don’t understand. His father was a known eugenicists? </p>
<p>Also when there was that big controversial thing about when he went to India, I remember seeing many videos and interviews of people who had adverse effects and apparently it was a large number. Now this got fact checked last time I saw it and now I can’t even find it at all. (I noticed a year ago google changed algorithm now google is fucking useless in general) 
I remember seeing many interviews and just clips of people being filmed on the street and asked what happened. </p>
<p>All I could find was this: https://m.economictimes.com/industry/healthcare/biotech/healthcare/controversial-vaccine-studies-why-is-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-under-fire-from-critics-in-india/articleshow/41280050.cms</p>
<p>Obviously the deaths had no relation. But this is why everyone is raising the question including me. </p>
<p>Is it really hard to accept that one of the most richest/powerful men in the world can get his way via censorship of media? This is not just about a conspiracy so to speak but more his career and image. Imagine if the news said “oh my god bill gates vaccinated all those people and THIS happend!” </p>
<p>The media NEVER does that in general because it’s common sense people will be fucking pissed at whoever is responsible and want their neck, so obviously in most cases the media has to be careful. The media Is really fucking powerful when you think about it. But people still forget headlines eventually. </p>
<p>In fact before bill gates went from computer guy to vaccination guy, he did get highlighted in media for being a “corporate bully” so to speak when Microsoft was on the big rise. Shortly after he changed direction and here we are. </p>
<p>One of my many questions is how do people not see narratives are presented based on the fact images and career are on the line, so why is it so hard to believe censorship of that is impossible? </p>
<p>Also because I’m a dumb dumb please explain how increasing life expectancy and less miscarriages and more successful births - leads to less population? I know China has a limit of kids you can have which is like 3 now?</p>

        <p>Maybe he was talking about this:</p>

<p>Humans are carbon-based. The concerns about reducing our "carbon footprint" is code for drastic population reduction.</p>

        <p>But apparently many many many years ago before all these billions of people the CO2 level was massive compared to now?</p>
<p>Not to mention the mega companies ripping down trees and forests</p>
