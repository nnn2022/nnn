    <strong>Pregnancy &amp; clotting</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I’m not sure where to ask this but I’m seeking any info or links on miscarriages/clots due to being NEAR people who have been recently vaccinated. My friend recently became pregnant and her cousin who lives with them got the shot around the same time. A week later, she miscarried. She was telling me this and I couldn’t hell but think back a couple of months ago when I also had a bleeding episode in my early pregnancy. I spent the weekend at my sister &amp; brother in laws who were recently vaccinated. The next Friday, we went to the hospital because I was bleeding. Turns out I had developed a subchorionic hematoma. I’m not sure it can be a coincidence but I’m trying to educate myself on if this is a real thing.</p></p>

        <p>I've seen things like this reported more than once. I'm sorry for your friends loss.</p>
<p>I haven't found any studies or data, but it's enough to where as a pregnant woman I stay the hell home and avoid recently vaccinated people like they plague.</p>
<p>My best friends daughter works in an ER in Houston. All the nurses and ER staff are vaccinated, and my friend and her husband are. Months after they all got vaccinated my friend told me all of the women that work there are having terrible, heavy, ongoing cycles and her daughter said she's just happy she is done having her own children. Somethings definitely fucky.</p>
