    <strong>UK: Help me respond to my MP who voted for the Coronavirus act, saying it is "proportionate"</strong>
    <p><p>Hey,</p>
<p>I got this reply from my MP and want to share with you. I'm planning to reply, any thoughts on good questions / point to raise would be good.</p>
<p>cheers, keep it real</p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>Dear Mr Redditguy,  </p>
<p>Thank you for contacting me about the renewal of the Coronavirus Act.  I totally appreciate your view, and I am also frustrated that restrictions on our lives are continuing, with all the damage to mental health and our economy.  </p>
<p>I’m sorry to say, however, that the Coronavirus Act is a vital piece of legislation in our national response to the Coronavirus pandemic and one which I feel I must continue to support. The purpose of the legislation is to protect us all and ensure that, throughout the pandemic, sufficient staff are available, and deployed where they are most needed, as well as supporting members of the public, containing and slowing the virus, and managing the deceased with respect and dignity. The Act would have expired at the end of March and so needed to be renewed to ensure that Local Authorities, the Police and the NHS continue to have the powers needed to respond to the pandemic. The powers are also necessary as we move forward with the cautious easing of restrictions set out in the Prime Minister's Roadmap.   </p>
<p>I would like to reassure you that all the measures in the Coronavirus Act are temporary, and proportionate to the threat we face. It is important that they will only be used when strictly necessary, and will only be in place for as long as necessary to respond to the pandemic effectively. I welcome therefore that the Government has carried out an extensive review of the provisions within the Act and, because of the excellent progress in our fight against the virus, the Government is now able to expire and suspend a raft of measures within the Act. <br>
The measures outlined in the Government's Roadmap provide a path out of this pandemic, offering us a route to normal life. I am encouraged that we are currently meeting each of the Government's four tests for easing restrictions and remain on track to deliver on vaccine commitments meaning we can move forward to the next stage of the Roadmap from April 12th. The Government has also committed the remaining stages of Roadmap into law.   </p>
<p>As we move forward with the Roadmap, it is vital that the tools needed to continue to fight this virus and support families, our public services, and the economy through it, as provided in the Coronavirus Act, are maintained. That is why I support the continuation of the Act and voted in favour of its renewal.  </p>
<p>Thank you again for taking the time to contact me.   </p>
<p>With best wishes,  </p>
<p><strong>The Rt Hon. xxxxxxxxxx</strong><br>
Member of Parliament for xxxxxxxxxxx</p></p>

        <p>I had a similar conversation with my MP. I asked for a cost-benefit analysis, as well as proof that these draconian laws are proportionate and temporary - nothing.</p>
<p>I had asked a bunch of questions, mostly statistical, some ethical, and the only one they would answer was to confirm that The Great Reset is real but then they called it a conspiracy theory in the next paragraph.</p>
<p>They’re puppets.</p>

        <p>Ivor Cummings has a video where he discusses the live years lost to lockdown vs covid. That alone demonstrated the lack of proportion in the response.</p>
