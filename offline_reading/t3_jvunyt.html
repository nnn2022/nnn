    <strong>Looking for stats from CDC/WHO/Any "government, sCiEnCe backed" about survival rate</strong>
    <p><p>Hey all, love this page. Makes me feel sane and not like some "pSyCho GrAndMa kiLleR!!!!!" </p>
<p>Anyways, I'm constantly seeing what the actual survival rate is from COVID on here as well as other subreddits (r/coronaviruscirclejerk, etc), and wanted to know where are the link from our great and faithful CDC to back these numbers up. I only ask so that when my doomer family members harass me *yet* again over going out to breakfast or going for a run or going to church or literally just living life at all, I can slap em with the numbers from the source they claim to worship and is guiding their life. Thanks in advance!</p></p>

        <p>This is what i was able to find a week or so ago. </p>
<p>"The CDC's latest death counts indicate that the crude case fatality rate is around 28 percent for patients 85 or older and 18 percent for 75-to-84-year-olds. That rate falls to about 8 percent for 65-to-74-year-olds, 2 percent for 50-to-64-year-olds, 0.6 percent for patients in their 40s, 0.2 percent for patients in their 30s, 0.06 percent for patients in their late teens and early 20s, 0.02 percent for 5-to-17-year-olds, and 0.04 percent for children 4 and younger." What the death rate is</p>
<p>I used this as a comparison from webMD about cancer deaths. Annualized covid deaths seem to be less than cancer</p>
<p>"2018, an estimated 9.5 million people died of cancer worldwide. That’s about 26,000 people each day and 1 out of every 6 deaths. About 600,000 cancer deaths happen in the U.S. each year and about 80,000 in Canada. The rest happen in countries all around the world. About 7 out of every 10 deaths from the disease happen in low- or middle-income countries"</p>
<p>But then i looked into what the shutdowns can do because i got tired of being a grandma killer (ngl tho if i was old id give my life up for a young person to survive at that point id have already lived and id expire soon)</p>
<p>"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of children could die this year due to the global economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic and tens of millions more could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the crisis, the United Nations warned on Thursday."
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-children-un-idUSKBN21Y2X7</p>
<p>And then i also looked into the pcr trsting they use and well the test is something else. Im no MD but this doesnt look correct and on my comp i uave a pdf saved from a lab stating doing pcr testing stating that the test cant differentiate between virus or bacteria let alone between the flu or covid (so when flut season hits and in west america its finally getting into winter season, we should see a spike in covid cases</p>
<p>https://needtoknow.news/2020/08/bulgarian-pathology-association-says-covid-19-pcr-tests-are-scientifically-meaningless/</p>
<p>And the trst itself</p>

        <p>well, how about this:</p>
<p>cdc and who estimate the real number of infections are ten times higher (10× the official number)</p>
<p>this would make the death rate sink by 10 times, no?
(this is known as IFR=infection fatality ratio, which is the one that matter, as opposed to the CFR- case fatality ratio- which are the official numbers of deaths/ official number of cases)</p>

<p>(note that this is without going into the faulty death reporting, pcr tests, etc. - and of course they tried to spin it and say it's apparently bad, because "90% of the planet didn't get infected yet" lmao)</p>
<p>hell, CDC even made a study with planning scenarios, in which they discuss the IFR, and it ranges from 0.003% for young people to 5.4% for the very elderly(70+)  (scroll a little to see the table)</p>
