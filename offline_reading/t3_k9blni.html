    <strong>I'm a regular poster here - My brother and his very pregnant wife (34 wks) are polar opposites of me, and they're taking the Covid Vaccine next week.</strong>
    <p><p>Sorry in advance for the rant, but I gotta get it out somehow. My sister-in-law (and basically all the women in her family) are nurses and think they know better than everyone else. Case in point - in March right as the shutdowns began in the US, I made a FB post about how this is complete BS, a very clear example of government overreach and how detrimental this will be to our economy, our children, our elderly, etc. How it will lay the foundation for ever-increasing draconian measures to be brought against society by world officials wanting nothing but more power and control over their citizens, and so on. I was called a Conspiracy Theorist by my SIL, told "You clearly are uneducated about how medicine and viruses work - STAY IN YOUR LANE and don't speak of things you clearly know nothing about." by my brother's mother-in-law, and my own brother basically told me how selfish and dangerous it is for me to have an opinion that differs from the medical professionals. </p>
<p>Fast forward 9 months and they're about to have their third child. My SIL is very high risk and in fact my brother had to have a vasectomy reversal in order to even get here... Since my brother and his wife both work in medical related fields they are both at the very front of the list and very enthusiastically waiting for taking this highly dangerous and unverified covid vaccine. I fear for my unborn nephew and the danger this could cause him. I fear for my sister in law (I truly do, though I can't stand her most of the time) and I absolutely fear for my brother and what this could do to him with his preexisting medical conditions. </p>
<p>This shit is real and it has real consequences. We are not just in a fight for "No New Normal" in a passive sense - we are in a fight for common sense, individual liberties and the health and safety of our own family members. I realize that statement could be considered true from a Doomer's POV and argument as well, but there's no other way to put it. </p>
<p>We are at war with something intangible and bigger than we can imagine, and our only defense is to stand our ground and know why we do it. </p>
<p>Rant over.</p></p>

        <p>Sadly, they are adults and if you made your case and they choose to ignore you, there isn’t much you can do.  One last ditch effort you might try is to ask your SIL, if this vaccine has been rigorously tested in pregnant women.</p>

        <p>I wonder if I could get out of taking it by claiming I’m trying to conceive. I’m not, and I don’t even want kids, but at my age (early 30s) no one has any reason not to believe that.</p>
<p>Edit: but it’s also worrying that they might deny women contraceptives if they make this claim</p>

Can you not buy the pill online? We can here in the UK. I mean I think if you have a LARC fitted that won’t pass as an excuse.</p>

        <p>You know, all I want in all of this is choice.  The freedom to make my own decisions about my health and the freedom to assess my own risk.</p>
<p>For me, that's a two way street.  People who want the vaccine, who want to wear a mask for the rest of their life, who want to stay home are welcome to do all of that - they feel that is what is best for them.</p>
