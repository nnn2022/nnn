    <strong>Why do boomer's get so fixated on personal liberties??? Hahahaha. Oh sweet summer child</strong>
    <p><p>This is from someone who hates their idiotic boomer anti-vax uncle.</p>
<p>This person was arguing with their uncle.  It seems the uncle understands the clear risks involved with the loss of personal liberties and this person does not.</p>
<p>&rt;The "Argument" for young people to not get Vaccinated</p>
<p>&rt;Was talking to my anti-vax uncle this weekend, and while our family has a "rule" not to bring politics and such into conversations, this always seems to get broken by them because they always bring up this stuff...</p>
<p>&rt;Anyways, my dumbass uncle was trying to get on the subject of vaccinations and saying how young people didn't need to get vaccinated because we're the lowest risk of dying from it. I cannot fucking stand this "argument"; why do boomers/antivaxxers believe we have no responsibility to protect other people? It doesn't matter if I get infected and spread it to an older person who is or isn't vaccinated - my selfishness is STILL AFFECTING OTHER PEOPLE, especially if its my own family. </p>
<p>&rt;This whole notion, that its the government trying to control us, they're trying to take our LiBeRtIeS away, and all this shit is what makes me so mad. Why do these anti-vaxxers get so FIXATED on that? Does anyone else feel this way? Where does this mindset come from? Just needed to vent here.</p>
<p>I don't know, maybe he knows something you don't know, but I might be wrong.  Maybe he was even involved in one of those dirty wars where he risked his life for the liberties of this person.</p></p>

        <p>Why would other people’s health be my responsibility?</p>
<p>If you’re vulnerable, get a vax. If you’re young and healthy, dont. Even if the young guy gets sick, the vulnerable would be protected because they got the fucking vax. That’s how this works.</p>

        <p>People who think like this are very naive.</p>
<p>Here in Canada, they lowered the History Credit Requirement over 20 years ago.  For the past 20 years, most Canadians have learned exactly zero history during their high school experience.</p>
<p>I do frequent little check ins with my friends.  Simple things like, "in what year did Napoleon live?".  From otherwise very intelligent and capable people, I have gotten some extraordinarily answers.  "The 1400s?". (I have seriously gotten that).</p>
<p>I think most people do not understand history.</p>
<p>I think this girl, complaining about her uncle, has zero understanding of history.</p>
<p>If she had a better understanding of it, she wouldn't be asking such as asinine question.</p>
<p>I believe this was by design.</p>
<p>"Give me a kid in high school, and I'll give you a Marxist for life."</p>
<ul>
<li>Lenin (paraphrased)</li>
</ul>
<p>We are witnessing the fruits of this deliberate undermining of history.</p>

        <p>It's a virtue signalling fallacy that YOU getting the vaccine will protect other people. That's simply not true, and the MSM has convinced a large population that it's the case. Here's the facts on why: </p>
<p>You get the shot, you can still both contract, and transmit Covid to other people. By getting the shot, you're reducing your relative risk rate by the percentage that the vaccine is effective. So you're fatality rate for a 30M is like 0.00007 percent. So now it'll go to 0.0000035. </p>
<p>THIS RISK REDUCTION IS YOUR RISK REDUCTION. </p>
<p>You're volunteering and signing an EUA agreement for you and you alone. People are being tricked into thinking that by getting the vaccine, they're virtuos and will be rewarded with "back to normal life with restaurants and travel". </p>
<p>Now looking at the fact that theyre being dangled this carrot of an untested vaccine. </p>
<p>Old people or anyone above probably 50 should calculate their risk, but young people it's causing more damage than its worth. </p>
<p>Covid is over and you're uncle is smart.</p>

        <p>These people are nuts. Same people who don't want the government telling them who they can marry or what to do with their bodies when it comes to pregnancy (which I happen to agree with) suddenly losing their minds when people object to being the test subject for experimental vaccines. </p>
<p>Still waiting for someone to explain how they think the vaccine, which they're unclear on whether it prevents spread, is so much more effective at preventing spread by reducing illness in a population that naturally is not getting sick from it so therefore would logically not be spreading it when unvaccinated either.</p>

        <p>Interesting how they become so angry and emotional at someone's opinion. Rather than having a conversation with their uncle they would rather cry to strangers they consider friends and remain blissfully ignorant.</p>
<p>Amazingly, 70%+ of Americans participate on social media, which only makes up 7% of the total userbase. This doesn't even account for bots and trolls. Why would anyone feel drawn to random strangers you'll never meet over your IRL family?</p>
<p>1 is an actual bubble of people, the other is pure fantasy. Maybe they should work on their reality before diving back into fantasy immediately.</p>

        <p>People who think that any government could be benevolent have never opened a history book or seriously pondered what governments actually are.</p>
<p>The very idea of a government is that there are people who have the right to tell others what they can do, cannot do or will HAVE to do, otherwise they have the "right" to inflict violence upon them.</p>
<p>Once you think about it, actually THINK about it, the very idea of a government is inherently immoral and always will be so. There are no exceptions to this.</p>
<p>Anyone who condones the existence of governments is a terrible human being. Ignorance and naivety is no excuse for supporting tyranny.</p>
<p>Unless you argue for moral relativism but then you're already a lost cause.</p>

        <p>This is true, but the interesting thing is that the founding fathers here in the states fully recognized this and did their best to prevent us from suffering the abuses of such a system.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately those protections have been slowly dismantled.</p>

        <p>The US was a very interesting experiment. I don't think there's ever been a more free place for individuals to live in the history of mankind than the early USA, before 1913. Not even in the hunter-gatherer tribes we used to live in, we were heavily dependent on the approval of the tribe back then.</p>
<p>As an European, it's baffling to me to see the american "leftists" doing all they can to destroy what made USA such a unique place to live in. Just move to any other shitty ass authoritarian country if you don't like it, there's plenty to choose from lmao, now more than ever. Then again they have no mind of their own, being pawns used by the people in power to destroy the west. Sad times we live in.</p>

        <p>Could they virtue signal any harder when Fauci, MSM, CDC, et al. ALL say that you have to keep wearing the mask even after the vaccine because you can still catch and transmit the virus. I guess that doesn't fit their own personal "feel good" narrative.</p>
