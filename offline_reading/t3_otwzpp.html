    <strong>Pressured into getting a vaccine by the UK government</strong>
    <p><p>Well, we had a good run boys. Here in the UK the government is currently implementing a vaccine passport and it looks like several public spaces will require one to enter. Nightclubs have already been confirmed and there is a lot of talk about universities denying in-person lectures to unvaccinated students.</p>
<p>I'm 19, healthy and had no intention of getting the vaccine until the very end, but I'm afraid the pressure is just too much for me to handle. Every day I spend hours scrolling social media feeds in search for COVID related news, looking for some hope that mandatory vaccination won't become a thing in this country. Every day I get more and more disappointed and depressed by the state of our society. I'm afraid I can no longer handle this endless loop.</p>
<p>I just booked my vaccine appointments in hopes that once I get it, my mental health will improve because currently it's unbearable. I do not support mandatory vaccination but I'm afraid there is no other way.</p>
<p>Have you experienced this kind of thing or am I alone in thinking this way?</p></p>

        <p>Sounds like to me you need to take a holiday away from electronics and news. </p>
<p>Vax is up to you, of course, but taking a break before the appointment may bring you better clarity as to what is the best decision for you.</p>

        <p>If they haven't isolated the virus, how can they create a vaccine against it? And if it's not a vaccine, what is it and why would you want to put some unknown thing like that in your body, especially since you've seen all the adverse reactions?</p>

        <p>That’s what they want! The promise of freedom will turn out to be a lie. In Australia, they haven’t rolled out anything like that yet, but I fully expect it to happen within the next 6 months.
 I’m kind of hoping that by the time we’ve caught up, the rest of the world will abandon vax passports and we won’t bother. 
 It’s a depressing thought though. I would definitely try and hold out for longer</p>

        <p>I guarantee, the world you are helping create if you take that shot isn't one worth participating in anyway. You cannot put a price on bodily autonomy, it's priceless. Everyone who thinks they're gonna be free to go on holidays and fuck around once they get this is in for a shock. There are more agendas at play and they certainly don't involve letting the peasant classes fly wherever they want. Agenda 2030. I understand the fear, but be brave. They've destroyed the world you loved and complying with the new world order isn't going to help anyone except them.</p>

        <p>I think the Novavax one is supposedly a normal vaccine but not sure - look into it. In terms of getting a choice over which vax you might be able to get a specific manufacturer if done privately, but don't expect choice through the NHS.</p>

        <p>you could try to get sinovax or sinopharm somewhere, but i'm guessing all these oldskool vaccines will not be enough for a vaccine passport. some countries already not recognizing deactivated virus vaccine as a proper covid19 vaccine and are pushing for mRNA vaccines or Oxford at least.</p>
<p>so you need to ask yourself if you are hesitant in getting 1 vax, are you willing to take 2 different types of vaccine?</p>

        <p>My partner went and they had a "choice" I think mostly it was based on your first vaccine (if you had it). If its your first one they had a doctor outside forming lines based on "Pfizer??! Who wants pfizer? This line please" "Anyone for Astra, or walk ins please line up to the right please!" It was very weird. It felt like a movie, as nearly everyone had masks on and were lining up in a car park with black and yellow tape everywhere with tons of posters "stop covid19" "know your nhs number" "keep your distance" etc etc. Was glad I wasn't going in there.</p>

        <p>it isn't really mentioned but usually these places are jam packed, chances of getting covid19 is higher, so would be ironic if you catch covid while lining up for the vax, as the vax takes 2-3 weeks to create antibodies in your body, the virus would have gotten comfy in your body too.</p>
<p>also ironic part is certain % of the vaccinated are getting placebo shots, so if you unfortunately got the placebo and covid at the same time, you would most likely fall sick and still assuming you got the vax. No way to test if you had a placebo shot or not since once you get covid you have antibodies.</p>

        <p>if you can wait out, including have some of your freedom striped, the vaccines will be available for public to purchase once the vaccination program reaches certain targets and vaccines are more readily available. you would be able to select your vaccine but you have to pay for it.</p>
