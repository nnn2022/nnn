        <p>This is such bullshit. So he's saying science confirms that masks work. But you can take the mask off to eat in a public place surrounded by other people? You have to wear a mask in an empty building if the building functions as a public space, yet we know that the virus can't survive on surfaces and doesn't transmit from surfaces? How is this the least bit scientific? He's claiming that it's to stop asymptomatic people from spreading the virus, even though there is no evidence that asymptomatic people are the ones spreading the virus. ScIeNcE! I have asthma and I'm hearing impaired, so I'm not wearing a mask. Period. But this is totally absurd. I hope people completely ignore this BS and get on with their lives.</p>

        <p>Newsom is claiming that the rise in cases is due to people not wearing masks.  He actually said, "we're seeing too many people with uncovered faces."  Like, what the actual fuck is going here?  Suddenly, bare faces are taboo in society.</p>
<p>Someone needs to remind this asshole that LA county has been wearing masks and doing all the required shit since April and our cases are the worst in all of CA (according to Newsom's "science and data").  He just said a few days ago that he's very concerned about LA because it keeps going up.  So, dumbass, if masks prevent the virus, why are places where masks were mandated for months seeing a rise in cases?  Yeah, science.  This bullshit is really getting out of control.</p>

        <p>Cloth masks are utterly useless. The fact that they recommend any cloth to be worn on the face really shows the level of quackery we're dealing with. Just saw that idiot judge on TV wearing his bandana, someone tell him that it doesn't do jack shit, but he's all proud of himself for passing stupid laws and "keeping people in his city safe". The disposable masks are for large droplets, that's why doctors and dentists wear them...it is literally to protect both patient and doctor from each other's bodily fluids. These masks don't protect against viruses, If you can smell through it, then a virus can enter through it. It's total bullshit how they spread this masks are good myth and how they did a complete 180 on this back in April is truly astonishing. Even more bizarre? How everyone who would have never even given one second of thought to wearing a mask just a few months ago now sings the praises of masking and shames those who don't comply. Just like 1984..."Oceania was always at war with Eastasia".</p>

        <p>Yep. But telling people any of that is like talking to a brick wall. Plus, I've seen so many people (including Newsome!) wearing the mask down on their chins. Like, what? What is the point? I have no problem with people wearing a mask if they're bent on doing it. Whatever floats your boat. But mandating masks is going too far, especially because it is in no way based in science.</p>

        <p>I disagree about "they can choose to wear a mask if they want". Choices aren't made in a vacuum. These people would have never in a million  lifetimes worn masks if they weren't programmed to do so by the media and their government overlords. It isn't really a choice if you're brainwashed into doing it. Normalizing masks means enabling and coddling the delusions about this virus and also means people who don't wear them will be shamed. That's why they must never be accepted, and there's no compromise when it comes to things like this. And about them wearing the masks on their chins, notice how so many of those protesters do that. They can spare me all the sanctimonious bullshit about how "masks save lives" and "I wear it to protect others". The mask is a talisman, a symbol of the Covid religion. They use it to fit in, to virtue signal and show that they are "woke", and to ostracize and deride those who refuse to play their game. Everything about Covid is political.</p>

        <p>The programming is very real. You're right. But where I live, there are people who wear a mask every flu season, especially the older folks. I don't necessarily think all people wearing masks have been brainwashed. I think some of them just do this whenever a bug is going around. I agree that the normalization of masks is corrosive though. The shaming and virtue-signaling, too.</p>

        <p>I've never seen any person, no matter their age group, wearing a mask during a flu season. The only people I have ever seen wearing masks are of course medical professionals who need to, and people at the clinic or doctor's office who are sick with obvious flu symptoms are given a mask in the waiting room during flu season. This whole obsession with masks is creepy and it's safe to say that over 99% of those who wear them and advocate for them, and beg for them to be normalized would have never even given a thought to it just a few months ago. It's scary how so many can be programmed in such a short amount of time.</p>

        <p>The mask wearing during flu season is probably a regional thing. It's fairly common in areas with a large asian population. But yeah, the hysteria seems to be more contagious than the virus. It's frightening.</p>

        <p>So it exempts going out for walks. But you’re required to wear masks in an elevator.</p>
<p>This basically will hit people in buildings a lot more. Basically a punishment for not buying a McMansion since every time you leave your place.</p>

        <p>California is a bit late to the game.  People are either already wearing masks because they think it does something, or they've already realized that this is bullshit.  I don't see how this is going to make a difference.</p>
