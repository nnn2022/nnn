    <strong>Tomorrow War = depopulation? (repost)</strong>
    <p><p>Any of you seen the new film out "Tomorrow War"?</p>
<p>In  the film, there are little girls talking about vaccings and how great  they are.In the future, aliens called "white spikes" (reminds me of  spike protiens or covid) have killed most of the earths population,  leaving 500,000 people alive remaining. This is (I think) the a similar number on the Georgia Guidestones to which they want the population to be kept at (under 500 mill someone said).</p>
<p>Don't  know about you, but if you know anything about the shit they put in  films to prep us so it seems (e.g. Marvels end game and thanos snap =  covid and lockdown), this is kinda concerning.</p>
<p>It also had climate change in there of course, and it was set 30 years int he future (2050, which is the milestone in the absolute zero document foor zero carbon emmisions)</p>
<p>What are you thoughts?</p>
<p>(Also, this post was for some reason removed by moderators. No idea why, thought this was a good sub, can somone enlighten me on why it might be?)</p></p>
