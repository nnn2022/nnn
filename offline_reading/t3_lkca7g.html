    <strong>Spain and the Catalan elections</strong>
    <p><p>Spain right now is in a semi-lockdown state. In most places, depending of your town's "covid score" you can or can't do things like going to non-essential businesses, and we still have a curfew. 
If you are positive but "asymptomatic" you can't even go outside at all. If you live alone, or your family also is "asymptomatic", that means you can't even go outside to get food.</p>
<p>After weeks of being like that, on February 14th they had elections in Catalonia, and the very same politicians and "experts" that advised people to not go outside at all if possible suddenly were advised to go in masse to vote. Even <strong>positive</strong> people could go vote <strong>in person</strong>. You know, those very "dangerous" people that I stated before couldn't go outside even to get basic needs? They're allowed to go outside to fucking vote. </p>
<p>That's it, that's my rant. It's so ridiculous and obvious they're over-exaggerating the risks of the virus except when it benefits them. Just when you think you've seen it all... I'm not mad anymore, just really sad and tired.</p></p>

        <p>I mean, this country was the pinnacle of corruption and thievery for years.</p>

        <p>I'm with you, and most people seem to just blindly agree. I just hate the fact that you can't plan anything anymore in even a week-span. I just want to live my life, is it too much to ask? :/</p>

<p>This is odd. There are a lot of Latin Americans who move to Barcelona and Madrid because "those cities are magic". I mean, I understand we in Latin America have it worse, but I just want to point out that the Spaniards don't seem too happy right now.</p>

        <p>Of course we are not happy.
This country is the biggest illusion of them all for Latin Americans.
They come here hoping for a better future (and honestly, who can blame them) and end up working a full time job in a bar for 400â‚¬.</p>
<p>The reasons? I don't know, probably propaganda or maybe just the fact that Spain doesn't have the incredibly high crime rate that latin america has in general. All my latin friends have told me a story that involved them being in serious danger.</p>
<p>But the most common scenario is that people here end up living in a room and working so much, which I call inhuman.</p>

        <p><em>Gracias</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, most countries are seeing important reductions in crime rates in recent years. Even Honduras and El Salvador.</p>
<p>Some of them leave for the economy, but there's a younger (18-22) crowd who leave because they like the progressive ideas of Spain (same-sex marriage, feminism and so on). Yes, some people emigrate for that.</p>
<p>I don't judge anyone. Everyone should be free to decide what they do with their lives. However, it caught my attention that Spaniards report a brain drain of their educated young population.</p>

        <p>My friend, Spain hasn't gone through hardships (Like most of latin america) for years. My point with this is that you are surely underestimating the stupidity of the Spanish young population.</p>
<p>This is a country that in 2019 was consumed by "my body, my choice" feminist message only to discard it instantly in 2020. Lol</p>
<p>Like, for example: Their argument is that any kind of coercion in order to touch their body is rape. No means No (and I am completely fine with them standing up against rape). Then they go on with all their cojones and tell you that you must get vaccinated, because yes and media says so. Coercion, isn't it? I guess only women's body matter here or something.</p>
<p>They are progressive only because it is mainstream to be progressive. Oh and majority of them are very racist towards Latin americans by their acts but defend them in public for social score farming.</p>
