    <strong>Damned if you do damned if you dont</strong>
    <p><p>I literally began an enthusiastic discussion with someone about how fascinated I was to see the future developments of mRNA technology for different diseases, but stated I do not trust the current mRNA ones because of no long term data, also the people behind Covid mRNA vaxes right now are super shady so I'm not getting it. Still got called an antivax anti-science crazy conspiracy theorist. There's really no winning with these people. Bruh you don't see me crying of fear because others didn't get the tuberculosis vaccine and I did. Maybe it's time to turn things around and tell them they're antivax for not having the vaccine I have. </p>
<p>Look maybe I don't even know if mRNA is good or not, but damn even being optimistic with a grain of salt gets you nowhere. Like it could have been actually a good thing if it wasn't for the shitshow of those governments and pharmaceutical corporations using it only to fill their pockets with the last drops of blood- I mean cash from the peasantry and fearmonger for control with no long term data and questionable scientific articles.</p>
<p>Besides who the fuck cares if you're antivax. I wouldn't care if my friend, spouse, child, neighbor or stranger was one. Why do they have to always be the target of societal bs insults. What happened to my body my choice?</p></p>

<p>There’s no point in trying to change them or getting upset at their reactions. On the contrary it’s very funny, stay amused.</p>

<p>You have no idea how much shit I take for expressing this.  The technology has the potential to be world changing. And in a good way.</p>
<p>This example?  Let me look at it. I mean this is quite literally mRNA V 0.4.  I hate to install alpha tests.</p>

        <p>Exactly. No one wants to be an experiment. But there are maybe (maybe not but who knows) possibilities for incredible medical advancements that could be applied to so many things as long as it's not done with the intent of screwing the population with something that could harm them without even being liable for it.</p>

        <p>My dark fear is that a large part of the motivation here is to allow for a free (and possibly mandatory) large scale trial of the technology. </p>
<p>They didn't have the money to fund a large scale test.  Or, actually the product. 
But the data we are accumulating is worth literally Trillions.   If you look at new Billionairs in the US, most are healthcare and half have stock in Moderna.</p>

        <p>My body my choice is not valid when it does not fit the narrative. The fact is that if others are vaccinated we do reach a herd immunity point for that and other reasons. There is no reason to trust mRNA at all its killed a shitload of animals and just magically appears as a savior as all of the big pharma companies owners turn into billionaires.</p>
<p>Its all fucking fishier that Cardi B’s whooha, also Ivermectin and other less aggressive treatments are being stamped put by the MSM in favor of their big pharma masters solution. </p>
<p>Couple that with the downright LIES of the infected and deaths numbers. They are shutting down the field hospitals that were setup and they were NEVER used. And I have it on good authority that many covid wards are likely empty, they are being used to bolster the $$$ for the hospitals and are lined with people who are not infected with covid or have active symptoms.</p>

        <p>You have a good point about the past data about mrna. I was more optimistic of the advancement possibilities. But so far it hasn't produced any actual effectiveness and it's definitely seen in the fact that they're trying to shove a third shot out of nowhere when up until now they were blasting us all with their 95%+ effective rate. That and numbers are easily shaped in the narrative. Statistics can indeed be easily manipulated. And their polls were mostly a joke with the most ridiculous samples to even consider them representative. And...With all the publicity, treats and gifts, songs and pushing there's something weird, I agree.</p>
