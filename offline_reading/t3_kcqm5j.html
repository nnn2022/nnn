        <p>As a Catholic I say this.</p>
<p>The stench of trite bs wafting off that statement is flooring.</p>
<p>You know, the church can blow it all out their ass with all this. My whole life. Through catholic school, through being dragged to holy days, through catechism class to have first communion then conformation. Sucked into volunteering. All of it. The church always loved talking about how strong they are. How the most important thing you're suppose to do in your faith based life is to receive holy communion every week. To receive the consecrated body of Christ. Which is why the great and powerful church held mass no matter what. Even in secret. Even under threat of death in communist countries. Priests would still go to homes to hold mass. This was paramount.</p>
<p>Until this came along and they all said Fuck it, none of it matters.</p>
<p>Stay at home and watch on tv. Oh but don't forget to still give us money. Our parish sent out letters even crying about funds. You know, for all those services they no longer provide. No rosaries, no last rites, no confessions, no masses. Funerals but only a few can attend and they charge for those anyway.</p>
<p>So now here I am, hanging by a thread as it was to my feelings on the church. And they essentially confirm my thoughts on the church back when I was a teen were right all along. It is all bs. None of it matters.</p>
<p>Because if it does matter and it is as important as you've claimed. Then you provide it. If you can just say fuck it all. Then it clearly wasn't important and didn't matter all along.</p>
