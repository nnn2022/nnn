    <strong>Indoor Dining and the Mangling of Social Life</strong>
    <p><p>I expected to feel some happiness when Washington's Governor Inslee announced that indoor dining would be back next week. Instead, I felt something closer to apathy and despair. I'm not excited for a few reasons, but the thrust of why is that everything that we're being allowed to do again will be "mangled" by draconian restrictions.</p>
<p>The restaurant will be 25% full at most, so whatever vibe/atmosphere I previously enjoyed will be nonexistent. The ma√Ætre d will basically do a TSA style screening of me and all my guests to make sure we're compliant. The waiters will snap at me to put my mask on (which is crazy if you step back and think about it) if I stand up to go to the bathroom without it. Social interaction between me and anyone I didn't come in with will be actively stopped.</p>
<p>You could say I'm just being a baby about it. Maybe I am. But this mangling of every social event just sucks the enjoyment out of it. It feels like a big compliance test as opposed to a chance to relax and be yourself. The scary thing is, people are being trained to view this mangling as <em>virtuous</em>. They relish in applying covid restrictions to everything, including their own endeavours when no one is watching (lots of people double masking while alone in their cars ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). I don't think people are aware of just how warped social life has become.</p>
<p>In short, I'm realizing that the effects of the lockdowns are much more far reaching than I'd ever imagined. The new normal is actually becoming real and with the current vaccine messaging, I think people are already adapting to this new mangled social atmosphere. Not trying to be a doomer here, but I couldn't help but call it out.</p></p>

        <p>You are absolutely in the right to complain that this half assed opening will be completely unenjoyable. If people went out to eat purely for sustenance, maybe it wouldn't feel as bad but people dine out for enjoyment, socialization, and celebration. If you feel like you're being treated like a prisoner for daring to darken the doorstep of a restaurant, maybe they don't deserve your business.</p>

        <p>Yeah, this is the same as gyms in Ontario when they were "open." They acted like they were doing people a favour by letting their diseased bodies come through the doors. One local yoga studio wouldn't even let people go to the bathroom unless it was an emergency, but it is now out of business. Wonder why.</p>

        <p>After seeing what outdoor dining entails during the winter months, I‚Äôm starting to think indoor dining might actually be safer.</p>

        <p>Enjoy the small pleasures now.</p>
<p>Europe leads the way. And the way is ration tickets. And unique menu. You sit down and they bring you whatever leftovers are in the kitchen. Or how the military used to say: Don't ask, don't tell.</p>

        <p>It's insane to me that the mass majority of Washingtonians are like "man, things are really bad right now" then proceed to vote the same guy in.</p>
<p>I also believe the establishment propped up Loren culp to be inslee opponent because he is easily discredited.</p>
<p>Washington got scammed out of millions of unemployment money and the head of that department just got appointed to the White House! Clown world!</p>

        <p>For real. He did nothing about CHOP and the constant destructive riots that are still occurring as of this week. As long as he repeats the Trump bad/racism/climate change mantras he doesn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt to do anything else. Pretty cush gig üëçüèΩ</p>
