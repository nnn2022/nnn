    <strong>I hate that the government stepped in and interfered with our lives.</strong>
    <p><p>Life just isn't the same anymore.</p>
<p>Fact of the matter is I feel like I can't enjoy life like I used to. Even with life in my area "returning to normal". I wake up every morning feeling miserable. Like at any second the government can just flip a switch and make even vaccinated people obey their rules. Which is still wrong to make unvaccinated follow them as well especially if they already recovered from Covid.</p>
<p>The year of the bull shit has done a real number on my mental health. While I try to go out and have a good time the moment I'm back at home I'm miserable. Perhaps it's because I'm sick of my home for all the time I've spent in it. Perhaps I'm worried like in LA things won't keep going in the right direction. There's even still reminders and Covid shit still scattered to remind you of the "deadly pandemic".</p>
<p>Having to still wear masks on transit, at the dentist and hospital visits. I'm honestly even at the point with a vaccine I'm still nervous about visiting the hospital even for a check up. Imagine I go in needing something and they write it off as Covid or "Covid Related". I've seen the horror stories of patients medical bills after them being forced to stay at hospitals for months on a ventilator and get a million dollar bill afterwards. I feel like I won't get the proper diagnostic I actually need and even if I do I can't afford it.</p>
<p>Between all that I just stopped giving a fuck. This whole situation has left me questioning what's there to enjoy in life where you have to watch every little thing you say or do? People are being fed from the news and government to hate my kind. That all white men are nothing but racists. It makes me sad and hurt to think people are pushing the narrative we are all bad people. </p>
<p>I'm just an emotional wreck nowadays. While it's good I stopped giving a fuck it's also changed me. I've been more snappy at people lately and easily. I get more tensed up easily. I get angry whenever I think of all that time I've isolated, staying distant and used to wear a mask everywhere I went indoors. I feel like I've just had enough of everything. Between Covid and this shit of a society we live in now.</p>
<p>It's left me to stop caring...</p></p>

<p>&rt; I wake up every morning feeling miserable. Like at any second the government can just flip a switch and make even vaccinated people obey their rules.</p>
<p>That's the problem, and that's people seem not to understand about the situation.</p>
<p>It's not the restrictions. It's the fact that since the precedent was created, I and everyone else will live their lives having to check on TV what they're allowed to do today. It's no way to live for me. I guess most people don't care - they're used to being told what they can and cannot do anyway. Not me.</p>

        <p>I'm honestly afraid that we will never go back to normal. Like you said, the precedent is in place and even over a year in and governments in EU still have no long term plans how things will look like in the future.</p>

        <p>Do NOT stop caring. This situation can’t go on forever. Think of the future generations, you’re doing this for them too. </p>
<p>I have to go out, I’m running late, or I would sit here and write more to you, hoping that others do just that. </p>
<p>You know the truth, being forced to take the vaccine will not make you feel better. Remember, this situation can’t continue like this, the evidence of the destruction and sickness this jab is causing is becoming more and more apparent as each day goes by. Hold on in there.</p>

        <p>I feel you, mate. Personally, I feel more anger and resentment, but it's not a happy space, for sure.</p>
<p>I'm still fixed on waiting it out, though. They cannot keep this ludicrous tyranny up forever. Either it will simply cease to be relevant (the delta variant bullshit is already shows covid has become a non-issue), or it will crumble under its own weight when people are feed up and finally see through the smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>The latter will be more painful, however, there's some part of me that really wants to see the current dictators be held accountable.</p>

        <p>I feel you, man. Your writing reminded me of Nietzsche's famous quote:</p>
<p>"Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster. And if you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you." </p>
<p>Two things I suggest</p>
<ol>
<li>Read a good book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28257707-the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck">I really enjoyed this book</a> and think you might as well. I would recommend getting a library card and using it to rent audio books (<a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">you can use an app here</a>) if you aren't into reading.</li>
<li>I would also suggest you stop watching any form of news and put down your phone / turn off your laptop. You will have just as much control over the world as before, and you will find the world is much more pleasant when you do.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hope you find some joy in the darkness.</p>

        <p>Same, in my teens I realized that, I couldn't continue to be a shut in gamer. I worked hard on being social, took me years, finally I could hit the bars, or clubs 2-3 times a month. In the summer festivals, sailing, traveling with friends and other stuff. Yeah I might be a ugly virgin brown guy in a European country but I managed to get the best out of it. But that changed, even when things have opened up I barely see my friends. And the sad thing is these things above just make me so happy, and not having them be reliable or on demand hurts so bad I kinda just wish I stayed a shut in neckbeard. I don't think I can rebuild the that, even if I manage my friends might marry and become boring before that.</p>

        <p>Same here. It doesn’t help that I am in California and masks are reinstated in LA County. I just started getting back to the gym, something I deeply missed for like 16 months before masks were dropped and lockdowns ended. And now, I have to know that at any moment, masks may be mandated at the gym again and I won’t be able to go there to work out. I was able to piece together home workouts and classes at a mask free studio, but it isn’t the same. People who don’t go to the gym and work out regularly (aka most doomers) don’t understand.</p>

        <p>I've woke up crying some mornings. I am very chronically ill. Life was hard enough before this. I am deathly afraid of ending up in the hospital fearing they would push the vaxx on me. A friend warned me our local hospital is having the nurses that are working with the Covid patients working with everyone else. I will only go to the hospital if I am acutely dying. Some serious stuff is going wrong with kidneys, and related to possible impending lupus. My social life and group connections have been destroyed, these were fellow liberals who bought into this trash. I have no one to talk too off line though I have a few friends online who see through this crap. Politically I am homeless and uninterested--they are ALL liars. I worry about husband being influenced by the NPCs. I am trying to find new people, I may revamp my entire life. It's hard doing this when disabled. Don't give in to the poison vaxx, health is everything. I hope things get better. Try and live life outside of society as much as you can, I shut the news off, etc.</p>

        <p>Here's some things I've been telling myself lately:</p>
<p>- It's time to move. Get out of the city </p>
<p>- Focus on yourself and what you can control</p>
<p>- Get exercise, go outdoors, spend time in nature, get out of your own head and enjoy life in the present moment</p>
<p>- Distinguish between healthy mourning of the life you have lost<br>
 and unhealthy self-pity and despair or worry about the future</p>
<p>- Consider that being demoralized by all this bullshit may actually be the healthy and sane response. You are being gaslit and manipulated. Don't let it get the best of you</p>
<p>- We have all lost our previous "normal" lives. This is happening to us all. Choose to be a survivor. Choose NOT to be defeated</p>
<p>- Try re-framing this clusterfuck as an "opportunity" to burn away the deadwood that constituted your former self and rebuild a new life and a new you (and clean your damn room!)</p>
<p>Easier said than done!</p>

        <p>welcome to the club.  </p>
<p>its the first step.<br>
realizing that your government is not working in your best interest and is quick to make live miserable for you was a shock for many.<br>
deep down most people know this. the difference between knowing something and REALIZING it is huge though.  </p>
<p>don't let it break you. thats the most important thing now.<br>
you still got power and they can't control everything.<br>
never let the goverment demoralize you. the people will win eventually.</p>
<p>&rt; all white men are nothing but racists</p>
<p>guess what, the media and social media are a bunch of twats.<br>
racism is a hollow buzzword now. thrown into the general direction of every white male in existence.<br>
all the while black South Africans openly call for a genocide of whites and indians in SA.</p>
<p>if someone calls me a racist I wear that shit like a badge of honor nowadays.<br>
fuck yeah I am racist. I aknowledge that there are genetical differences between humans. I absolutely prefer to be in the vicinity of people who share a similar appearance and behavioral patterns than myself.<br>
this is natural and normal.<br>
what its not is that it makes me hate everyone else who does not fall into that category. on the contrary.<br>
I fully accept that there are different people and that me and them may not share the same views or same looks and thats perfectly fine. I am willing to let these people be as long as they are willing to return the favor.</p>
