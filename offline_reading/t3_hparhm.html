        <p>Maybe the tide of opinion is changing...These 18 Canadian epidemiologists with impeccable credentials (including distinguished leadership of federal and provincial public health agencies) are fed up with the futile attempts at suppressing the pandemic and recommend accepting the realities and getting on with our lives (i.e. herd immunity): </p>
<p>&rt;The undersigned represent current and past leaders in public health, health care systems and academia.  We are writing to you to with our thoughts regarding a balanced approach to dealing with COVID-19  We strongly believe that population health and equity are important considerations that must be applied to future decisions regarding pandemic management.  </p>
<p>&rt;The current approach to dealing with COVID-19 carries significant risks to overall population health and threatens to increase inequities across the country.  Aiming to prevent or contain every case of COVID-19 is simply no longer sustainable at this stage in the pandemic.  We need to accept that COVID-19 will be with us for some time and to find ways to deal with it.  </p>
<p>&rt;The current and proposed measures for reopening will continue to disproportionately impact lower income groups, Black and other racialized groups, recent immigrants to Canada, Indigenous peoples and other populations.  And it risks significantly harming our children, particularly the very young, by affecting their development, with life-long consequences in terms of education, skills development, income and overall health.  </p>
<p>&rt;Canada must work to minimize the impact of COVID-19 by using measures that are practical, effective and compatible with our values and sense of social justice.  We need to focus on preventing deaths and serious illness by protecting the vulnerable while enabling society to function and thrive.</p>
<p>&rt;Elimination of COVID-19 is not a practical objective for Canada until we have a vaccine. While there is hope for a vaccine to be developed soon, we must be realistic about the time it will actually take to develop and evaluate it and then deliver an immunization campaign covering the entire population.  We cannot sustain universal control measures indefinitely.  </p>
<p>&rt;We need to accept that there will be cases and outbreaks of COVID-19.  We need localized control measures that are risk-based.  We should consistently reassess quarantine and isolation periods, recommendations for physical distancing and non-medical masks, and travel restrictions based on current best evidence and levels of risk. At the same time we must improve infection prevention and control in long-term care and congregate living settings.  We should provide support for people living in the community who need to or choose to isolate when the disease is active, as well as those who have been adversely affected by COVID-19, or the consequences of the public health measures.  </p>
<p>&rt;Canadians have developed a fear of COVID-19.  Going forward, they have to be supported in understanding their true level of risk, and learning how to deal with this disease, while getting on with their lives – back to work, back to school, and back to healthy lives and vibrant, active communities across this country. </p>
<p>&rt;We acknowledge the heroic work that has been done in recent months by many across all levels of government and the public and private sector, and the sacrifices that Canadians have made to get to this stage.  As we look forward, Canada must balance its response to COVID-19.   </p>

        <p>Yep - it's like George Carlin said. We love declaring war on things that we don't like:</p>
<p>&rt; Did you ever notice that about us? We love to declare war on things here in America. Anything we don’t like about ourselves, we declare war on it, we don’t do anything about it, we just declare war on it. It’s the only metaphor, the only metaphor we have in our public discourse for solving problems: declaring war. We have to declare a war on everything; we have a war on crime, the war on poverty, the war on litter, the war on cancer, the war on drugs, but did you ever notice we got no war on homelessness? Huh? No war on homelessness… you know why? There’s no money in that problem, no money to be made off of the homeless. If you can find a solution to homelessness where the corporate swine and the politicians could steal a couple of million dollars each, you’ll see the streets of America begin to clear up pretty goddamn quick, I’ll guarantee you that!</p>

You don't even get a notification that your post is invisible to others, so you can't even complain. I edited the comment to copy and paste in it the original comment I linked to, initially.</p>
