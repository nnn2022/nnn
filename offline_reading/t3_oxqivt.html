    <strong>A new frontier of human rights in 21 century.</strong>
    <p><p>In the classical sense the understanding of freedoms is reduced to “I don’t touch you, and you don’t touch me either. Here is my property, I do what I want,” then in the new normality, where everyone is a potential carrier of the disease (viruses, for example). It obsolete now. </p>
<p>The society has overcome a new milestone, with the active assistance of the authorities, of course. The level of terror in the media and social networks is off the charts.  It is argued that the very fact of the existence of an individual, his life activity, poses a threat to others. We all breathe the same air, emit different fluids, and do not wear spacesuits. Hence, no freedom is possible in principle. Previously, there was no audacity to postulate such a thing, but now it is a new normality. Humanity finds itself in a situation: everyone is a threat, a terrorist (I fear everyone). The presumption of innocence does not work, because there are "asymptomatic patients". The private property and private space doesn't work either, because we breathe the same air. It is worse than carrying guns. We can control our gun, but can't our viruses. It's like carrying a bomb and doesn't aware of it.</p>
<p>Therefore, for protection, it is required to isolate all individuals from each other, and interaction is possible only with the approval of the authorities (by license, vaccination certificate e.g.). Prison or GULAG model.  If you were given a temporary document that you do not carry a threat, you can live as usual. If you do not have such a document - in solitary confinement and refusal to provide any services by the state and private business, as subject to the state including healthcare and food supply.</p>
<p>What do you think, can we accept it? Excuse me, if I wrote it clumsy, English is not my native.</p></p>

        <p>I'm not accepting this and am leaving the country. People in the developing world are way more civilized than Westerners and they haven't been susceptible to decades of social engineering turning them into egomaniacal babies afraid to stand up for what's right.</p>

        <p>There is a problem. Civilized society don't accept violence. But you can't defend you rights and freedoms without it. Government do violent, but people are not. The result will be destruction of western civilization as we know it.</p>

        <p>You did a good job there. I could tell that English wasn't your first language, but everything you said was clear (understandable). This seems like what we see happening. And it's all because of genetic manipulation of a virus. "Science" gave us this "new normal" and the governments are happy to impose measures of control. We must fight back against it... But our biggest problem is that they have already taken the minds of too many people. They have made them both afraid and angry. They have given the people very simple ideas; even though the truth is complex. We need to begin winning back the people's minds.</p>
