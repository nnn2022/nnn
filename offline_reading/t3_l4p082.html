    <strong>Violent Protests will NOT Work!</strong>
    <p><p>We take to the streets peacefully you are labelled as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Murderers</li>
<li>Enemies of the state</li>
<li>Dissenters</li>
</ul>
<p>Protesting online will <strong>never</strong> get your voice to those that are responsible for decision making.</p>
<p>As we know, peaceful protest never got anybody anywhere did it? 2 world wars saw to that.</p>
<p>BUT, protesting violently only plays into the hands of governments. Violence provides them with a great opportunity to invoke heavier military-grade restrictions. We are well and truly stuck in a matrix.</p>
<p>You could argue that the citizen pushback you're seeing across Europe has been planned in advance by government ops. Think of it as a false flag in order to push heavier restrictions on the populace. Far fetched? I wouldn't rule it out.</p>
<p>Remember, the Elites are expecting citizen push back. It's written in Klaus Schwabs COVID19; The Great Reset book and Rockefellas Lockstep. If they're expecting it, they've planned for it.</p>
<p>The Great Reset is happening, and we are fighting a losing battle. Coronavirus is real but it's being used as a political tool. A tool for those at the very top of the political and financial pyramid to enact their dystopian agendas. Sometimes, the cure to the virus cannot be worse than the disease. And government tyranny and authoritarianism is far worse than anything COVID19 could enact on the populace.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p></p>
