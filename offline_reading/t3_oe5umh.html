    <strong>Ivermectin is banned because it's too cheap to produce.</strong>
    <p><p>We should be talking about ivermectin more. Instead of talking about vaccines let's promote ivermectin. It's something that's getting a lot of positive results. It has been used in India and Mexico. Dr.Pierre kory talks about it. He's recently been on the JRE Podcast (I recommend listening to it) but has his own. His YouTube content has been removed but he is a doctor using this getting positive results for the treatment of covid-19. He should be heard.</p>
<p>He theorises that "big pharma" doesn't want invermectin to be used as it doesn't cost much to produce. It would mean that less money would be given for funding research and vaccines and new medications. </p>
<p>In short he says that ivermectin has shown strong evidence that it subsides the effects of covid-19. It helps deal with post vaccines side effects and covid-19. It's been used to many illnesses and has been used for million if not billions of people.

        <p>Not only that, it treats </p>
<p>1) "COVID"</p>
<p>2) Spike protein sickness (from shedding) which I think is actually the same as #1</p>
<p>3) Post-vaccine symptoms</p>
<p>4) "Long COVID"</p>
<p>Apparently other antiparasitics cure cancer. There's been plenty of cheap, natural drugs that cure cancer but don't get approved because there "aren't enough clinical trials." It's literally the antidote to their bio warfare depopulation plot.</p>

        <p>Why do you think Trump, who was such a big HCQ champion, didn’t take it when he caught covid and instead relied on the best that big pharma could give him? Have any of the biggest proponents of this or hcq refused big pharma treatments when they caught covid?</p>

        <p>1) HCQ, while it does seem to work, seems to be much less effective than ivermectin.</p>
<p>2) There are lots of "hit piece" studies by pharma to make the drugs look less effective (using too small a dose or starting too late), perhaps the evidence was legitimately more muddy then.</p>
<p>3) They gave him some high-tech experimental antibody cocktail that basically no one gets and wasn't even approved at the time (regeneron).</p>
<p>4) Trump generally seems to say one thing and do another, it's entirely possible he's just as much in on this whole charade as Biden or any other political puppet.</p>

        <p>When I was recently hospitalized for covid i was given remdesivir (not sure about the spelling). To my knowledge, it didn't do shit. Cost me about 15000 dollars though so that's good. Slightly less than my hospital stay. I think my er visit and hospital stay were about 22k-25k somewhere. In the hospital I asked for Ivermectin and was told they would not give it to me. I was to fucked up to care.</p>

        <p>Steroids bro. I was told by my doctor that they prescribe remdesivir for every covid patient regardless, but that he could not say how much of a difference it would make. Seriously that is pretty much a quote from him. I also had pneumonia as well and they treated it with steroids. Once the pneumonia was taken care of I was good to go home on oxygen. The covid symptoms stayed for another 2-3 weeks pretty much unaffected by the 15000 dollar treatment I received. I still have some symptoms to this day.</p>

        <p>I agree people need to protect themselves in anyway that is appropriate for their situation. The mRNA vaccine isn't perfect but it definitely works. There seems to be a direct correlation between the vaccine and the decrease in covid cases in the US. That being said there also seems to be a coronation between India's adaption of ivermectin as a treatment and the decrease in hospitalizations. I've heard in Delhi there has been a 97 percent decrease in hospitalizations since they started treating with it. Could also be that they started getting vaccinated though, idk.</p>

<p>I spout off about ivermectin too much without actually having read too many of the biggest studies and meta analyses, I'll get around to that eventually and reply to your comment when I find something. Let me know if you find any!</p>

        <p>If Ivermectin is indeed as effective as claimed, then this is the most likely scenario. Among the criteria to get an EUA according to the FDA, they mention that there can’t be another form of mass medication for the disease in the market. </p>

        <p>It’s still expensive to buy, at least in human-approved dosage forms, in the USA. (Veterinary forms are cheap as dirt, which should tell you something about the motivation for this pricing.)</p>

        <p>Ivermectin is banned because it obviates the need for mass vaccination. If this were about money, then there would lotteries and free donuts for people to take remdesivir as  pre-exposure prophylaxis. We can speculate all day on why they want to vaccinate everyone so badly, but it's been clear from the beginning that they will kill any treatment for COVID that isn't a vaccine and isn't given to everyone in the world.</p>

        <p>Why do you guys trust this stuff more than a vaccine? Honest question. ALL of this stuff - the treatments, the vaccines - are coming from the same place. It’s all from “big pharma.” Ivermectin is sold by Merck, one of the biggest drug companies in the world. What’s the difference between them and Pfizer or J&amp;J</p>

        <p>No, that's the point ivermectin has been used before and was discovered in the late 1970s. It's been used on millions of people and side effects are really mild.
 The problem is no one company has a patent for it and it's cheap.</p>

        <p>It’s how business in general works. You make a product and sell it for profit. Right now the vaccines are being pushed as the only suitable drug against covid. Ivermectin is being suppressed as more and more research is showing it’s efficacy against covid. Doctors aren’t getting paid to push ivermectin, they’re being actively targeted for doing so.

        <p>Untested FOR COVID TREATMENT. There’s not just one “test” that you do on medicine to prove that it’s okay to use. That’s not how medicine works. </p>
<p>Ivermectin could have been causing minor heart inflammation for decades and we could have no idea because it’s only used on patients with parasitic infections, but could potentially be catastrophic in patients with pre-existing inflammation </p>
<p>This is why you have to test EVERY APPLICATION of a medicine separately</p>

        <p>Given the period of time it's been used over, plenty of people with coincidental heart and lung issues would have had ivermectin too.  It was not worth nothing any problems experienced with that over all these years.  It's a very common medicine with a known method of action that's tolerated extremely well.</p>
<p>There is no meaningful risk from it beyond taking time swallowing a pill.  At the worst it would be neutral,. but a lot of evidence supports it helping, but since it's a generic drug, like Aspirin or ibuprofen, it's not profitable.</p>
<p>It's why remdemsivir gets to be promoted, because it costs thousands per pill even though it does essentially nothing... maybe shaves a day off your illness.</p>

        <p>Because of the marketing campaign that used psychological abuse, manipulation, threats, and outrageous incentives by corrupt governments and Big Pharma, all while the global financial system collapses in the background. I simply do not trust these people and there's nothing they can EVER do or say to regain my trust. They've permanently lost that from me.</p>

        <p>Good - so you don’t trust Merck or ivermectin either, right? Because it wouldn’t make much sense to say that ALL the other pharma companies are bad and the vaccine is bad, but Merck and their one drug are okay, right? This seems like an all-or-nothing scenario.</p>

        <p>You're absolutely right. I no longer trust the entire medical establishment at all. Unless it's for something really serious, I will never go to a doctor again as long as I live.</p>

        <p>Good, thank you. That’s my entire point. I don’t get why people are pushing this one medicine while railing against Big Pharma as a whole. It’s all coming from the same place.</p>

        <p>I get they have to earn money in order to employ people, and scientists especially, but there's most definitely a point at which it’s just pure disgusting and dangerous greed. We passed that level a LONG time ago. This is just evil on an entirely new level.</p>

        <p>Ivermectin is a generic now, merck even dissed its use because they make no money off it. It costs liek 10 cents to manufacture ivermectin in india, or about 2 dollars in america. Its basically dirt cheap.</p>
