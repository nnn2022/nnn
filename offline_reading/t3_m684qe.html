        <p>Always be willing to change your opinion with new evidence, not clinging to your beliefs for fear of the shame of having been fooled. Accept that it happens to everyone at some point and move on. </p>
<p>I've been fooled in the past, it's helped me learn to look for people's motives when they make grand promises while simultaneously dipping their hands into your pockets and gaining more power over you. In this case I would love to be wrong, and so i constantly look for real evidence to contradict my opinion. Nothing has so far</p>

        <p>You may think you are open, but the bamboozle has so engulfed you that you reject evidence, no matter how real, because you believe the bamboozle too much to actually accept the truth.</p>

        <p>So you chose to assume that because my mind hasn't been changed that i refuse to look at evidence. That is not so. I have changed my mind many times, especially at the beginning of this whole charade. I looked at evidence from all sides trying to form my own opinion. And i constantly challenge that opinion. Can you say the same? </p>
<p>The real difference in both our cases is that there are people profitting by encouraging your opinion but no one is profitting from encouraging mine. Who would be trying to bamboozle me? No one is trying to get power over you here</p>

        <p>No, my point is that you don't understand the quote.</p>
<p>If you have been bamboozled, you don't realize you have been bamboozled, therefore you would truly believe what you say and think about being open minded and open to changing your mind, but you wouldn't actually be open minded and open to changing your mind because the bamboozle had affected you so much and you would openly reject things that were real evidence as not real evidence because of the bamboozle.</p>
<p>That's the point.</p>
<p>I am not and was not making an argument for either side, I was simply talking about the state of the bamboozle from this quote, and those who have often don't think they have been and think they are open, but they really are not.</p>
<p>That's the point of the quote, but you are missing it.</p>

        <p>I do see what you mean, but the main idea here is that someone has to bamboozle you. If no one encourages me to think a certain way then i cannot be bamboozled. If my thinking is wrong then it would just be wrong, i wouldn't have been fooled into beleiving something. That's why he talks of charlatans.</p>
<p>I understand that some people think that they are open to new ideas but really are still being fooled. But it still takes a charlatan to try and fool you. 
How to know you're not being bamboozled? If no one is encouraging/pushing your point of view</p>
