        <p>Depends on the channel and where you live. Most media is for profit, meaning they will pander to a specific audience, so yeah, some of that audience will be for fear-mongering and hysterical talking heads. And yeah, that also makes sense in America since there is zero regulation. Now if you take a different country which actually HAS some regulation, say, a country where the news is actually unbiased, then you will have media which speaks the truth. I understand your point of view if you live in a country like America, but otherwise, what you're saying is simply not true. If the news does its best to be unbiased, then yes, it might <em>sound</em> like fear-mongering and hysterical talking heads, where in reality it's just the media trying to tell the truth, and <em>you're</em> the one being hysterical and ignorant. Learn the truth.</p>
<p>Also yes the virus is real, and you should probably do your best to protect people around you by self-isolating and wearing masks. It might not be 100% secure (obviously), but hey, it's better than doing nothing, right?</p>

        <p>It just takes time and the realization of sacrifice. I believe it will happen, but it could take years. People are still comfortable... they don't want to lose that comfort. That's why the slow coercion from government works, they can balance it and appeal to stupid people which there are more of.</p>
<p>Look to history, revolutions and independence take years.</p>

        <p>Yea I guess you are right, and I probably need to remember that more... it's just so frustrating and I think if by now people <em>still</em> aren't seeing through this, will they ever?</p>
<p>Case in point - my mother finally woke up to it all a few months ago but to my horror she is still wearing a damn mask 'because it's easier than not' (despite the fact she is medically exempt!!!) - I said 'easier than <em>what</em> exactly?' - I've not worn one the whole way through and not once been challenged which she knows (apart from at a blood test which quite honestly is post-worthy in itself, lol)</p>
<p>Makes me wonder how many other people I see following every nonsensical 'rule' also believe it's hogwash? </p>
<p>Then you get the 'but what difference can <em>I</em> make?' - answer, not much alone, but people do tend to follow others so be the resistance you want to see!</p>
<p>I guess my main worry is that we don't <em>have</em> years for people to catch up...there are quite a few of us been warning for years what they would one day implement with an 'event' and it's unfolding just as we said (and were laughed at for doing so) - tbh I wasn't even sure we'd see it so soon, yet here we are and it's accelerating at a scary pace</p>
<p>I need to practice patience though, you're right...what will be will be...but I for one will go out saying 'I'm not participating in your theatre!' lol</p>

        <p>It's good that you know where you stand! That is honestly what the world needs, to see the other side of the argument and to see people take a stand for it. Educate yourself so you can educate others.  It will be hard, but don't ever lose that and always know it can't be taken from you. That's yours! You can share it, you can help others understand it, and you can live it... but it cannot be taken from you! </p>
<p>I wish you all the best in the coming days, no matter how bad or how good they may be. Keep faith in your beliefs and continue to be better than those that would try to reduce you!</p>

        <p>Got to admit, I share your opinion 99 times out of 100 - yea I see people waking up to all this, but not quick enough</p>
<p>When I still see huge numbers of people <em>rejoicing</em> that we've been locked down <em>again</em> it's very, very hard not to come to that conclusion</p>
<p>When our local paper announced we were leaping from tier 2 to tier 4 on Boxing Day, the comments said it all...so many saying 'its the fault of people not doing as they are told!!!' - not realising that the reason they <em>CAN</em> lock everything down is <em>because</em> almost everyone IS 'doing as they are told' <em>EVEN THOUGH</em> the 'rules' are absolutely nonsensical (and they know it) and TPTB keep getting caught out NOT following them!</p>
<p>I feel like I'm in a waking nightmare</p>

        <p>Of course not. That's the reason why I'm pessimistic about this whole bloody thing. I've been observing this tripe all this year. No revolution is going to happen simply because, like you said, people aren't waking up quick enough and time is not on our side at the moment.</p>

        <p>Yep...and try as I might (and I do, believe you me) I find it hard to see beyond that</p>
<p>I have done nothing but research this since the very beginning when the first little reports were coming out of Wuhan...<em>long</em> before it was declared here and lockdowns started</p>
<p>The day-in, day-out coverage of the Diamond Princess cruise liner was a big red flag for me... everything I predicted back then has happened - I'm not a seer, just watched carefully what was happening, why, and what was to come</p>
<p>I wish I'd been wrong!!!</p>
<p>My mother rolled her eyes back in March when I said 'three week lockdown? Not a chance...we'll not be let out by Christmas' and effectively we haven't been - she's seen through it finally though</p>
<p>It's just all going too much 'on-plan' for my liking and, like you, I think time is running increasingly short for people to call a halt to all this</p>
<p>I guess I'd much rather be prepared than think 'no, it WILL all be ok' because that makes people complacent</p>
<p>We are in a situation where most people who have always said and known the Govt doesn't give a <em>damn</em> about them suddenly are clinging to this idea that what they are doing is for the public!</p>
<p>The elites are getting ever richer throughout this, while they tear apart everything that is precious to people - and people are letting them</p>
<p>It's frustrating and very, very hard to stay positive, I agree</p>

        <p>Every system based on a lie collapses e.g soviet union in most recent memory. While the leaders may think they are so ingenious and have acted so quickly, they cannot defeat truth itself in the same way that one cannot defeat gravity. So yes time is on our side. It's true that we might not see a complete defeat of this system in our lifetime, but in the long run, time is on our side and we will win.</p>

        <p>Bro the nature of the world is that everything dies, everything collapses, and everything changes. There is no exception clause for TPTB. They might think otherwise but this is akin to fighting gravitation. There are stronger forces in this world than the miserable TPTB.</p>

        <p>Well I can see that too, which is why I tend to sit in the middle...I don't think everything is lost <em>yet</em>, but equally it's not looking good either</p>
<p>If you'd told people a year ago that come Christmas 2020 they would be 'allowed' to see their family for one day only, only shop where you are told you can, and have to stand on markers keeping you apart from others while going to buy your groceries all because of a virus with a kill rate not far removed from flu - people would have thought you had run mad</p>
<p>Where will it all end? No idea - but what has unfolded so far seems scarily on-plan</p>
<p>Whatever happens, we now have a screwed economy that will have ramifications for generations to come</p>

        <p>Maybe, maybe not. Neither of us know for sure, just that things will get worse before they get any better. But dystopia can't last. I guess neither can freedom, so maybe there is an in between to be found that changes everything. Or maybe i just accept my fate like you and live out my days in misery and pessimism. Just rollover and let them fuck me. I'll just stop thinking that there may be something that can be done and get out of the way of people who will do something. </p>

        <p>Look who is talking like a lamb to the slaughter you follow what corrupt politicians say take a step back they profit from your pain. They don’t care if you die because they make money. That is the difference between you and them they have medical care and huge wages and get bribes, you have a sense of false confidence that is being reinforced by these politicians. But if you don’t where a mask please get the vaccine or if you get COVID don’t get vented and just die cause it’s not real</p>

<p>&rt;Among other things, studies find that people are more likely to endorse conspiracy theories if they feel alienated, powerless and disadvantaged, and if they are distrustful of others. Conspiratorial thinking is also associated with narcissism...<strong>Additionally, a variety of demographic factors have been found to predict conspiratorial thinking, including low levels of education.</strong></p>

        <p>Your evidence is a YouTube interview with a conspiracy nut?</p>
<p>&rt;Public institutions have been infiltrated and taken over by shadowy groups in the service of powerful private and vested interests, often at the expense of the common good.</p>
<p>Her entire Wikipedia reads like a nut with an axe to grind. </p>
<p>This is also particularly juicy.</p>
<p>&rt;During the United States presidential election, 2016, Fitts supported the campaign of Donald Trump.[17] On December 8, 2020, Trump retweeted one of Fitts' tweets which linked to an article on Breitbart.[18] She has donated to political campaigns of Democrats Cynthia McKinney and Marcy Kaptur, and Republicans Rand Paul and Thomas Massie.[</p>
<p>And let me guess, you think Trump was fighting them and had the election stolen from him as well.</p>

        <p>In another comment you talk about how reddit is an echo chamber, then go and make a comment like this, do you have any self awareness or do you think echo chambers are good?</p>
<p>&rt;It's that you simply don't understand where people here are coming from.</p>
<p>Oh no I do, I just think you're wrong and instead of using the opportunity to prove your point I have to "do my own research". That's not how it works. Again are echo chambers good?</p>
<p>&rt;Have a tiny bit of humility</p>
<p>Ironic.</p>
<p>&rt;rather than declaring everyone else irredeemably stupid.</p>
<p>You don't get to say moronic things without someone calling you a moron. I'm tired of people who got Ds in high school biology and didn't even take civics go around stating opinions and conspiracies like they are facts. And you talk about having humility. Did you graduate from college?</p>

<p>This is called anecdotal evidence. You should have learned not to base wide conclusions off of your own experience at some point in high school. "I don't know anyone who has it, so it must not be that common!" Or your area is largely unaffected due to variables you haven't considered. Or you do know people who have had it, but they're just asymptomatic. Or.... Or... Or...</p>
<p>Meanwhile emergency rooms in major cities are running out of space, and 300k people have died, but hey, YOU don't personally know anyone who had it, so I guess we can all just breathe a sigh of relief. Tell the ER nurses with ptsd that it's fine now. Tell the guys driving refrigerated trucks full of corpses they can relax. Everyone, this one dude doesn't know someone with covid! Crisis over!</p>

        <p>It's far from just 'my anecdotal evidence' that wasn't the point I was making...it all adds to the overall picture though</p>
<p>Where are the overrun hospitals? The MSM are telling us this is the case, while nurses and doctors are actually being laid off <em>because they have nothing to do</em></p>
<p>In my country (I'm not American - not everyone is, you know) the MSM is screaming that 'hospitals are almost at capacity' but when you actually look at the figures, most are running at expected capacity for this time of year, and dedicated 'covid hospitals' were closed without ever seeing a patient, whilst cancer patients had their treatments stopped</p>
<p>Where are the refrigerated trucks full of corpses? Have you seen one? Or just on the 'news' </p>
<p>300,000 people in almost a whole YEAR - do the maths yourself - that's one in ten thousand people a month - certainly makes sense to wreck economies, wreck lives, stop essential treatments doesn't it?</p>
<p>You've fallen hook, line and sinker for the fear porn - honestly, turn off your TV, use some critical thought and do some research yourself and you'll be far less hysterical I promise you 😊</p>

<p>If you look at my comments elsewhere, I'm not... it's far lower... I'm just replying that even IF its 300k, that equates to one death per 10,000 people per month...vanishingly small, statistically insignificant and certainly doesn't justify the hysteria</p>
<p>We know the tests are bunk...they shouldn't be used to diagnose illnesses, 40 countries say <em>no virus has even been isolated</em></p>
<p>UK aren't even using deaths anymore, purely 'infections' - more tests = more 'infections', its ingenious actually and the masses are falling for it 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>

        <p>1) I don't watch tv. I read. </p>
<p>2) the debate over shutting down--whether we save more lives by shutting down businesses but inflaming societal ills like mental illness, suicide, etc.--is still being hotly contested by economists, virologists, psychologists, etc. As far as I know, it remains inconclusive. However, there is no shortage of people liked you who are certain of the right path forward. Where did you get your expertise in balancing economic impacts vs. mitigating viral spread of a novel, rapidly mutating virus? What numbers are you using to come up with your conclusion that "300k dead isn't so bad," given that's about how many americans died in ww2, etc.? What journals, panels, etc. have you used to determine that we ought to just reopen everything and it'll be fine? </p>
<p>Or are you just picking people who parrot your point of view and ignoring anything to the contrary?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, another thing to consider: the economic damage we are seeing in the usa didn't have to be this bad. We could have mitigated it with relief money to most citizens like, I dunno, almost every developed country on earth. The argument that shutting down is doing so much damage relies on the fact that one arm of one political party wants austerity for those most affected. It's a false dilemma. </p>
<p>Anyhow, it's been an honor to talk to the person who finally solved this dilemma for the world. Looking forward to your press conference</p>

<p>Maybe. I'm old for reddit. I've lived in 20 cities across the globe so far. I have dozens to hundreds of friends in each city. And yet I still don't know anyone personally who has died from the virus. I know at least 50-100 who have talked about their covid-positive status publicly. And yet no one has died from it.</p>

        <p>Terrorists? Get a grip of yourself 🤣</p>
<p>That's what, 1 in 1,000 people right? Over <em>at least</em> ten months, so maybe 1 in 10,000 people a month - definitely shut the country down, wreck businesses, wreck lives, stop cancer treatments etc etc etc - the sky is falling!!!</p>
<p>And THAT is with the inflated numbers - 'died with' not 'died of' (I believe the actual numbers are around the 8,000 mark)</p>
<p>You realise how many people die every single day? Yet population is <em>still growing</em> at the height of a 'pandemic' - crazy huh?</p>

        <p>You realize people are still stupid in spite of having access to the internet. Crazy huh?</p>
<p>The number is 300,000. Every medical expert agrees, I dont care what facebook page you got your stats from, Karen. You can try to downplay it however you want, that's what it is. You people lost your shit when one one hundredth of those deaths happened in 9/11 to the point where you sent american soldiers to their deaths in the middle east but now that you have to wear a piece of cloth over your mouths you start screaming about your "freedom".</p>
<p>Our healthcare system is crumbling, ICUs are at capacity, and all you can do is bitch. You people are terrorists.</p>

        <p>Nope, you're quite wrong</p>
<p>Every 'medical expert' they wheel out on MSM agrees, many thousands do NOT and even IF the numbers are 300,000 (they aren't) 1 in 10,000 people dying a month does NOT justify the hysteria that is actually killing <em>more people</em> than covid <em>ever will</em></p>
<p>Your assumptions are quite frankly hilarious - I don't have Facebook, for one - I'm quite choosy where I get my info</p>
<p>Not sure how lil' 'ol me sat in the freezing UK sent <em>anyone</em> to their deaths in the Middle East, any more than any regular American did...you realise it's the politicians do that, no?</p>
<p>Fwiw, I didn't 'lose my mind' over 9/11 - that made no more sense than THIS does and I'm anti-war anyways </p>
<p>And masks - where do I even start?!? The masks that say on the damn BOX they don't provide any protection from coronavirus? The filthy pieces of cloth people pull out of trouser pockets, stick over their face and constantly pull at?
The masks that are shown to increase your risk of bacterial pneumonia amongst other things?</p>
<p>Carry on worshipping your beloved MSM and repeating their buzzwords</p>
<p>Hands! Face! Space!</p>
<p>Go hide under your bed until nobody ever dies again (hint: you will be there a <em>long time</em>)</p>

        <p>The numbers are 300k. The CDC, NHS, WHO all agree. Idk what other experts you think there are but I defy you to send me one credible source that says otherwise.</p>
<p>Yeah if you havent understood it by now you're a fucking doorknob. Masks dont protect you from covid, they protect other people around you from you by absorbing moisture and preventing droplet spread. This is well known and if you cant grasp that I dont know how you've made it this long in life.</p>
<p>You UK covidiots are paying the price. New Zealand is back to normal now because they listened to experts and the UK just had a new round of lockdowns because of morons like you. You're a terrorist and people are dying from your actions.</p>

        <p>What 'credible sources' would you even accept? I could send you a hundred but they wouldn't be MSM approved so I'm sure you'd dismiss them</p>
<p>But ok, again we will go with your super-scary 300,000 deaths in almost a year - ONE  in TEN THOUSAND people per MONTH - and you think that justifies this absolute hysteria?!?</p>
<p>Yes, I wonder myself how ANYONE has made it this far in life without strapping a piece of paper to their face to try and 'stop the spread' of something with a 99.8% recovery rate 🤦🏻‍♀️</p>
<p>There is so much data available that proves masks don't do anything, one way or the other...funny isn't it that since masks were mandated cases have risen, not the other way round? </p>
<p>You can throw insults all you like, doesn't effect me either way 🤷🏻‍♀️</p>
<p>And as far as 'covidiots' (there are many, walking round with nappies on their faces) - p-lease</p>
<p>I guess you are one of those who will say 'there is barely any flu this year because of the covid restrictions' then screech that 'people are dying of covid because nobody is sticking to the rules!!!!!' - painful</p>

<p>The true gutter of today’s online discourse.  Impressive.  I sincerely hope that whatever weight is on you to make you say such things lifts soon and that you realize it’s not us.  Good luck....</p>

        <p>Is it possible to tell whether this person deleted their comment or if a mod did?  Because I always think if it’s a mod I wish they would leave it.  Especially on this sub.  It’s such an exposure of the thought process we all deal with</p>
