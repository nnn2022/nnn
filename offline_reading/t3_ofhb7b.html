        <p>&rt; They often seem contrarian for the sake of being contrarian. </p>
<p>&rt; If they banned face masks tomorrow they’d kick off about that too.</p>
<p>This is the stupidest comment on the Twitter thread. </p>
<p>Anti authoritarian is NOT contrarian. </p>
<p>The government should NOT fine, ticket, arrest, nor police people about masks. Whether people want to wear them or not. That means that the government should not ban face masks nor force people to wear them.</p>
