    <strong>Does anyone else find this strange?</strong>
    <p><p>We know that there are people who want this sub gone. We see a lot of doomers and shills here, almost on every post. They comment either their honest opinions or they just do it for profit. Anyway, everyone is welcome here, we don't ban others with different opinions.</p>
<p>But, I found it strange that there's a lot of "boomer" memes lately. A lot of stupid arguments against lockdowns, quarantines, vaccines etc.
Not every single one of us is a conspiracy theorist, a lot of us just use common sense, but I assure you that every honest member of r/nonewnormal has a valid argument against this. Every single one.
We definitely have further informations to support our opinions.</p>
<p>But, we've seen screenshots of our sub around reddit lately, and most of them are those "boomer" memes which they found here. You will never see our real and honest arguments against this, all you will see around reddit is this sub being called stupid because there's a lot of "birds aren't real" kind of pictures.</p>
<p>So my point is, it feels like doomers are flooding this sub and making people with common sense look stupid by posting Karen memes they found scrolling through Facebook. A lot of people will think that's us.
It seems like a strategy. </p>
<p>But, I assure you that every single one of us here is willing to help and most importantly, to help you think independently.</p>
<p>*I am not saying I'm right about this, I just think that lately there's been a lot of information that is not valid, and doesn't look like us. *</p>
<p>I'd like to see your opinions.</p></p>

        <p>Anecdotally, yes. It seems to go in waves. A while ago It was a run of dodgy racial themed posts. Again, I suspected false-flagging then too.</p>
<p>Of course, some could just be genuinely bad memes from fringe conspiracy theorists. One of the hazards of questioning the mainstream is that you attract crazies.</p>
<p>Perhaps we need to be a bit meaner with our downvotes?</p>

        <p>I noticed this, too. They steal our circlejerk satire memes, or our ridiculous-on-purpose posts to plaster on other places on reddit. </p>
<p>Aside from some bullying (and even a bit of doxxing), I was thinking...if those posts taken from our sub into other subs trigger people to check out NNN for themselves—then a certain percentage of those people might actually visit here and have an “aha! moment” and realize that there are level-headed, thoughtful skeptics having conversations that question the narrative. They might even start to see our ideas and join our team! </p>
<p>I know that before I found this sub, I was miserable and thought I was absolutely nuts for being the “only one” who thought all of this was deeply unsettling and wrong. Once I found you guys, it was like a weight was lifted. It gave me hope knowing that others could see through the B.S. </p>
<p>So, while the brigading is annoying, it actually could potentially gain us more traction and support in the long run.</p>

        <p>I find this strange and disheartening as well. I'm new to reddit and only have posted in this sub, but recently I commented in r/Vancouver on a post which asked "where do <em>you</em> go for unbiased news in Canada, to which I replied rebel news. I was called a troll and they said my account was fake and downvoted rather agressively, when I was just replying honestly to a question that was asked! The irony of asking for unbiased opinion and then dismissing an opinion that you disagree with is counter intuitive and frustrating. I didn't really realize how unfriendly the wider scope of discussion forums can be. Guess I'll stick to communicating with the lovely people in this sub. Long Live Logic!!</p>

        <p>Too be fair, killing someone for speaking the truth would just bee to obvious today. So the expected strategy would be something along the lines with flooding a sub or forum with "extreme" theories or basically alternative versions of legit facts that's just not true or too bizarre to believe in, all in order to discredit a sub or forum.</p>
<p>The same strategy has been used to discredit "conspiracy" subs and forums as well lately. It works because the sheep will fall for it, like those who re post just to show "how stupid" we are, and those who fall for it, because obviously they won't come here and see for themselves, they'll just believe whatever they're fed.</p>

        <p>People love to strawman people who have the opposite opinions - if you just assume everyone here must be a flat-earther, it's an easy out without having to grapple with the facts that contradict your opinion. </p>
<p>It'd be pretty uncomfortable for them to admit to themselves that there's even a possibility that they've been locked up in their houses for the last year, 20 masks and all, for no good reason.</p>

        <p>I agree. But, I posted a Karen meme. I actually  I posted a whole video and story about where the term, 'Karen' comes from - that it's a term to defame and silence Karen Kain, the mother of a vaccine injury victim who became a huge advocate against them. But reddit just choose to ignore all of my other links and focus on the meme. I had to go add another pic to the front because I figured it wouldn't come off as the type of post it was meant to be, but too late.</p>
