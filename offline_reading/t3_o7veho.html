        <p>Centrally controlled crypto currencies and "smart contracts" is very far down the list of things I'd worry about. In fact, this sounds like it could just be digital food stamps.</p>
<p>Granted, in a cashless society privacy is at great risk. Yet, there will be thousands of alternatives and exchanges criss-crossing them all, even more so than today.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm far more worried about being beaten to pulp for going out side after curfew hours, or getting fined, arrested for not wearing a mask. God knows what will happen to those of us who stay unvaccinated.</p>

<p>Our society is built around money, it’s the core of everything. </p>
<p>They already control who holds the money through central banks and BIS, and now they want to control the flow of it. They won’t will need to touch a single finger on you when your money can be completely controlled.</p>

        <p>Let's say it's about welfare recipients. Are you currently worried about food stamps on a piece of paper? After all, its very purpose is to control what the holder of that voucher can spend it on. Would digital food stamps be much worse? (The main problem I see, is that there will be a digital record of when and what you bought, but that's the same as if you'd use any plastic card today).</p>
<p>Or what about other types of vouchers. I collect loyalty points in one of the grocery stores I shop from. Every month, the points are converted to some $30 which I can spend in their store. I cannot spend it elsewhere. And yes, I know the shop will know exactly how many frozen chicken wings I buy.</p>
<p>Now, would I take my salary in food stamps or vouchers? Hell no. What about Bitcoin or Ethereum? Why not. (Although, the price volatility is a problem).</p>
<p>Finally, would I want cash to go away completely? Definitely not. There is still a need for a tangible currency without other infrastructure requirements. If the central bank does not provide that, somebody else will. There are parts of the world where they still transact in strings of seashells.</p>

        <p>Digital currency≠ crypto currency, if you have a modern digital bank account or line of credit that’s essentially digital currency.</p>

        <p>Currency means the underlying monetary unit. It can be USD, Euros, Yen, and so on. Whether you deal in Benjamin Franklins or with a Visa card, you're still using USD as the currency.</p>
<p>To deal in a different currency, you will need to exchange one for the other. Typically at a currency exchange or a bank.</p>
<p>Crypto currencies like Bitcoin has become popular lately, enough so that banks are getting worried. However, they cannot control BTC, so they want to create their own.</p>
<p>If the bank's system is a digital representation of USD, it's the same as a credit card. Same underlying currency. However, if they create a second system, which you will have to exchange your USD to use, it would be a new currency.</p>
<p>Any digital transaction will need cryptography somewhere in the system, also Visa's. However, the new "crypto currencies" take that name because strong cryptography is at the very core of the implementation of the distributed ledger.</p>
<p>A centralized digital currency would not need a distributed ledger, so maybe it would not deserve the name "crypto currency". But in the end, that's nit-picking on names. All paper copiers are informally called "xerox", regardless of brand.</p>

        <p>i cannot say this is an entirely bad thing- if welfare recipients for example can spend their $ on on certain things and in certain time frames only bc it's programmed as such well that might be good... and less inflationary...  beyond that hell no.</p>
