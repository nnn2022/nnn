    <strong>Curious how much the mortality range of a virus can change from mutations</strong>
    <p><p>So I was reading the comments on an article on a Dutch platform and came across a guy saying that if you let go of all the restrictions, the virus could mutate into a deadlier variant. He said viruses like SARS-1 (10% mortality rate, he claims) and MERS (30% mortality rate, he claims) are cousins of Covid.</p>
<p>So I was curious, how realistic is that to happen? From what I can see (Dutch stats), the mortality rate is about 0.5% (deaths divided by the prognosed amount of infected, which is of course higher than the amount of positive tested and most seem to agree about 2-3x more) and the hospitalization rate is 1.5% and I would also think that most people that are hospitalized, but not on the ICU, could have potentially survived the virus at home in bed if push came to shove. So the mortality rate would probably be like 1% at worst. </p>
<p>So how likely is it that a virus with a 1% mortality rate mutates into one with a 10% or 30% mortality rate? Did it ever happen before in human history in lets say the last 50-100 years? Isn't it more likely that the virus becomes less deadly as time passes?</p>
<p>Serious responses please, I'm curious.</p></p>

        <p>Viruses have a certain nature where the more easily communicable and contagious they are, the less dangerous and deadly they are. Covid is just like all the other flu and common cold type viruses in that it is extremely contagious, but has an extremely low infection fatality rate, with the vast majority of people who contract it having mild or no symptoms. Such viruses don't mutate into something more dangerous, it eventually becomes a common cold, just like the six other coronavirus colds. Strains don’t stretch that far off from the original, and mutations are less deadly but more contagious because the ultimate goal of a virus is to survive, which it can’t do on dead hosts. </p>
<p>Even if it did have the miniscule chance of mutating into something slightly more lethal, none of this measures would be worth it and none of it would be able to stop that. The flu is also highly mutagenic, mutates every year, and could mutate into a strain that actually has a 2.5% IFR....the CFR of covid. But the risk of that is so miniscule that you don't wreak havoc on the world in a vain attempt to stop it.</p>

        <p>&rt; So how likely is it that a virus with a 1% mortality rate mutates into one with a 10% or 30% mortality rate? </p>
<p>That's not what is happening. It's a person's inability to take care of their health in general. There is a certain stress level at anytime in your life. If you can't adapt to it, you take damage. And damage accumulates and in the end you die because you can no longer withstand the environmental stress and adapt to it. And these pathogens they talk about, are there, just to recycle stuff otherwise there will be no life. Therefore mortality rate is dynamic and subject to a lifestyle. The same pathogen or habit can be dangerous to one person and have no effect on another person. Given that every organism attempts to establish some sort of balance in a given environment, what you call "mutations" are basically adaptations. The more adaptive an organism becomes, the less reaction/resistance/damage there is with respect to a given environment. We can see that in cells having a bonding between bacteria and viruses and ancient cellular forms. They create more complex and more efficient forms of life. </p>
<p>Therefore that 1% or 10% or 30% figure is unsubstantiated in the sense that without knowing the physical level and adaptive capacity of each one of us, it cannot be determined. In addition that percentage is not some "chance" to die. A person who has an adequate physical level, cannot be infected or die from covid. There is no 10% "chance"  or 1% or 30% "chance". There is no chance. And the same goes for someone who can no longer adapt. He will die, it's guaranteed. So what happened here in this fakedemic, is they are running computer models and when they claim that percentage is mortality, effectively they look what happened and make predictions on a global scale and about our future and that's totally wrong. Each person is different.</p>
