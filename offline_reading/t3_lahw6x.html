        <p>Based off of the details Brandy described it is clear imo whoever was hired to intimidate and possibly later kill Brandy was very well trained and had access to resources far above that of common criminals.</p>
<p>The ease at which the infiltration team skillfully picked the lock to her house and the fact that they knew the master code for Brandy's home alarm system and had the technical ability to hack and monitor ALL of Brandy's cell phone communications. Is a testament to the level of resources available to the infiltrators that is leaps abounds of above that of common criminals. </p>
<p>The style of intimidation such as moving objects around the home or placing key objects at the property based off private conversations are near exact to the intimidation tactics used by Stasi secret police forces during the cold war to cause the subject to feel mental distress and make the subject question their sanity.</p>
<p>As well the timing of the break-ins suggests the use of professional surveillance teams or GPS bugging of Brandy’s vehicle or cell phone tracking to know when she would be gone or coming to or from her home.</p>

        <p>Yeah this does sound with all of those things in the second paragraph put together as "Not your basic criminal doing this!" since the average criminal is too stupid to do those things, especially over a long time period.</p>

        <p>Not too mention, the death report stated gallbladder issues. None of her family, friends or personal doctors were aware of her gallbladder issues.
And if you've ever had gallbladder issues severe enough to kill you? You would have told someone something. </p>
<p>I believe her doctor actually came out and said that she had no gallbladder issues.</p>

        <p>These bastards stop at nothing to keep the truth from getting out. Or anything that goes against the narrative, if i recall correctly didn’t a judge involved in the epstein case have their husband shot and killed as well as her son? Something along those lines, a fuckin fed ex driver. This shit is so ridiculous man</p>

        <p>So... I'll just say flat out I'm not comfortable with some of the more recent posts that venture heavily into deep conspiracy territory. Both the local PD and coroner investigated her death and found no cause to believe that it was foul play. Toxicology reports came back negative. Suicide was ruled out. By all accounts she died of natural causes. </p>
<p>And the bigger question is... why? Why would a pharma executive risk going to prison by ordering a KGB style hit on someone using incredibly sophisticated poisons that a coroner wouldn't detect and do it to someone who literally isn't known to anyone outside of anti-vax circles when they could just discredit them by calling them a crank or just say "no none of what she is saying is grounded in reality" and move on. </p>
<p>The vast majority of the public would just go "Oh ok she's a crank" and move on. </p>
<p>And I am not at all an anti-vaxxer. I'm uncomfortable with the covid vaccines because they haven't undergone the same level of scrutiny as most vaccines do but I'm up to date on all my other shots and so are my kids because vaccines overwhelmingly work and are safe. </p>
<p>And the more conspiracy fringe stuff that makes it to the top here means the less credible this group is as a whole. </p>
<p>I'm for sensible guidelines that go along with the real risk of covid. Sneeze into your arm. Don't come to work sick, wash your hands. Maybe postpone that trip to grandma's house if you're feeling unwell, and put resources into protecting nursing homes and hospitals. That's why I'm part of this community. The draconian lockdowns and oddball restrictions are what I'm against. </p>
<p>But I am not for a single second part of any fringe yoga-mommy anti-vax group nor am I some sort of Q believing "patriot" that is "through the looking glass". </p>
<p>I just want my government to stop making fear-based kneejerk decisions that don't even jive with the available data or science.</p>

        <p>Again... why? If you want to make an example out of someone you do it like Putin does where people know in no uncertain terms that it was a hit. </p>
<p>Having some clandestine assassin offing a random nobody makes no sense especially if its all done with super secret untraceable chemicals. </p>
<p>It would be way easier to just hire someone to run her over while she's crossing the street or just shoot her. </p>
<p>It's a nonsensical conspiracy theory.</p>

        <p>If you'd like to start unravelling your confusion, begin with questioning whether any pharmaceutical executive would likely end up in prison as a result of a professional hit, even if their involvement was suspected.</p>
