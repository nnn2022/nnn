    <strong>Comparing post-9/11 and post-Covid (so far), disturbing.</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone else noticing the disturbing similarities here? For reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Iraq War support fluctuating</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lockdown support fluctuating</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More restrictions after 9/11 that never fully went away despite being promised as temporary</p>
</li>

<p><strong>More restrictions after Covid-19 that never fully went away despite being promised as temporary</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terrorism Era Scare (2000s and 2010s)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pandemic Era Scare with random variants (2020s)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A very popular black celebrity dies in a bizarre, suspect aviation accident shortly before 9/11.</p>

<p>Governments having more of an excuse to have control over your lives "for your safety" after 9/11, leading to less privacy or freedom.</p>

<p><strong>Governments having more of an excuse to have control over your lives "for your safety" after Covid, leading to less privacy (biden's new plan) or freedom.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>War on Terror (2001 - present, lives destroyed.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>War on Covid (2019 - present, lives destroyed. Zero covid as much as possible despite that goal being a pipe dream, look at Australia still having cases despite their best attempts. Smart way to keep this going forever.)</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 9/11, anything considered unpatriotic would get you called a terrorist sympathizer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>After Covid, any questioning of the narrative would get you called selfish, trump supporter or a conspiracy theorist</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9/11 Commission</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Covid-19 Commission</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The threat to the public after 9/11 was inflated by the media, and we were told about thwarted plots that were actually fake later on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The threat to the public during/after Covid was inflated by the media, and we were told about deadly "graphs" that were actually nowhere near as bad later on, even the scientists that put out these graphs later admitted it.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>President Bush "mission accomplished for troops in Afghanistan"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>President Biden "mission accomplished speech on July 4th, 2021"</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, history repeating itself? 9/11 is actually scarier though because pandemics eventually end and the restrictions themselves for covid are having people waking up (just look at the main doomer subs that are improving), while after 9/11, america NEVER recovered after that event, just kept going down and down in regards to liberties and war on terror is still going on 20 years later.</p></p>

        <p>I disagree with your last. This will NEVER end. There will always be some "ZOMG! variant! Shut down everything!" Look at Australia... By calling it 'the invisible enemy' was a tell- this 'war' will never end. (Not that the 'War on Terror' will either, but most just accept it as 'normal' now. In 20 years, people will accept the 'new normal' just the same.</p>

        <p>I didn't wake up to the real facts about 9/11 till 2006. Loose change. When this bullshit so-called pandemic hit I immediately thought mmhmm this is america up to its usual psy-op false flag tricks again. Wonder how long this is gonna go on.</p>
