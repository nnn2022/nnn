    <strong>Done with the B.S. Let's start talking solutions to bureaurats locking us down.</strong>
    <p><p>Please post your thoughts and strategies below.</p>
<p>Obviously having online businesses transacting in anonymous cryptos like Monero is a great start, but what solutions can we come up with to creat like "speakeasy" underground businesses that defy gov mandates?</p></p>

        <p>Pretty much every gun store I've been to has their own little tongue in cheek way of telling the tyrants to shove it. One says they'll assume you have a medical condition and won't bother you if you're not wearing a mask.</p>
<p>My personal favorite is one place in the next town that says they will not sell a firearm to anybody wearing a mask.</p>

        <p>Wouldn't it arguably be illegal to sell a gun to someone wearing a mask in some states? Don't some states require photo ID?</p>

        <p>Ignore government.</p>
<p>If they pull your license, continue to operate, if they lock your doors, cut it, if they arrest you, make sure your reaction is newsworthy.</p>
<p>It's really not that hard. Sack up and do it.</p>
<p>I assume so many businesses are so close to bankruptcy, it will never happen even if the owner is sympathetic.</p>
<p>The idea of a business license is voluntary handcuffs.</p>

        <p>These restrictions need be challenged in court.  The challengers need institutional backing.  It needs to be like a domino effect.    </p>
<ol>
<li>Cut COVID relief for the unemployed.  It will be painful and unpopular but it needs to be done. </li>
<li>Cut COVID relief for businesses.  Sadly the stimulus dollars intended for small businesses got gobbled up by bigger businesses that didn't need them.  This needs to go away. </li>
<li>Larger institutions need to stand up to the doomers.  "We don't want to go back to work!"  "Ok you don't have to but if you choose to stay home you're fired."  This will also be unpopular at first but people will quickly get over it.</li>
<li>Apply #3 to returning to the office.  If it's safe to go to Wal-Mart it's safe to go to the office.  "But the office isn't safe I want to work from home!"  "That's fine, that's your choice, but if you will only work from home you have no employment opportunity here."  Again, unpopular. </li>
<li>Sue governors and mayors who attempt to block constitutional freedoms.  It doesn't matter if they are frivolous lawsuits.  Tie them up in the court system.  They will be forced to spend money to defend themselves.  Charge them with treason.  Ok, that gets thrown out.  How about lawsuit #32,176?  Make them annoyed.  Petitioning their office does nothing, but this affects them personally and they will notice.  This is why you need institutional backing.    </li>
</ol>
<p>It will be like magic but overnight the restrictions will go away.  Right now we've had two road blocks.  #1, nobody <em>with institutional power</em> has the backbone to stand up to the doomers yet.  #2, the people who did have the nerve to stand up to it lack the resources to put up a fight and they get quickly squashed.    </p>
<p>Complaining about unequal enforcement, for example - government buildings have gyms open but private gyms are closed, or BLM protests are safe but anti-lockdown protests are inciting violence, etc, just doesn't work with them.  It doesn't resonate with the doomers because you look like an alt-right conspiracy theorist.  It's pretty clear that the leaders in charge will get re-elected no matter what they do (like the recall Newsom 2020 campaign is a laughable waste of time, there's no way that's going to happen), so the only option left is to hit them where it hurts - their pocketbooks.    </p>
<p>Imagine if somebody else who's super-rich like Bill Gates was just as politically active in calling for an end to the lockdowns.  Like imagine if Zuckerberg was anti-lockdown.  Musk doesn't count - he's not rich enough.  Needs to be somebody worth tens of billions of dollars.  Or imagine if Gregg Abbott actually had a spine and stuck to his guns with Texas re-opening (would be better if it was a democrat governor)?    </p>
<p><em>Hypothetical</em>  <br>
&rt; "We at Apple recognize that the risk of the virus has largely subsided and lockdown measures have been effective.  Everyone, give yourselves a pat on the back.  You're a hero.  We did it.  We beat this virus.  It is now past the point that it is safe to return to normal - and we all desperately want things to just go back to normal, to be able to visit with our friends and families, and to be able to earn a living.  That's why we have made the difficult decision to re-open our Cupertino offices at 100% capacity on October 1st.  Employees who are not currently back in the San Francisco area will be given two weeks and a one-time relocation bonus in order to get their affairs in order.  Afterwards, if they assess the risk as too great, they are perfectly entitled to remain at home, but Apple can no longer offer them employment.  We are running a business after all, we have a fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders."  -Signed, Tim Cook    </p>
<p>Can you imagine the domino effect if this happened?  People who continue to refuse to go back to work and wear their protective plastic wrap will continually look more and more ridiculous as one-by-one everyone returns to their respective offices.  People will catch colds, yes, but there won't be bodies in the street.  One can dream ...</p>

        <p>I don't necessarily disagree with much of this - but man, I live in a different economic reality. I work jobs like fast food, dishwasher, janitor - if I don't go to work I don't get paid and if I do that too many times I get fired.
The "pandemic" hasn't changed that for me.</p>
