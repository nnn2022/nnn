        <p>If you guys were to get the damn vaccine now it wouldn't come to that since the virus would die out (just like measles did in most countries), yet you are the reason why there will be X new varients and why the virus won't go extinct. And then you complain like you didn't do that shit yourselves. Are you guys really that unable to question your own decisions and beliefs and what the consequences of them will be?</p>

        <p>It's not just about life and death. The varients may become less deadly (it's a benefit for the virus since it doesn't kill it's host and thus can lice longer and spread further) but people still can take damage, even permanent damage from the virus and that's why we should act. If a virus is able to reduce quality of life because of it's effects on cardiovascular health, lungs etc (maybe you've heard of fatique-sydrome? then it's our responsability to act as humanity and reduce suffering as much as we can. Did we do it perfectly? Hell nah, yet someone had to act quickly so there was no time to find the perfect solution, we should lean from this experience and be prepared if another pandemic were to come, we should know what works, what makes sense and what doesn't.</p>
<p>No there were no varients, you wanna know why? The varients are larger mutations that happend in the genome of the virus, it takes time for mutations to happen and to be detected and not every single mutation is significant enough to call it a new variant. 
Why you hear alot about the different variants now that the vaccines are out? Because it does play a role in effectivnes of the vaccine and if there is a major mutation that makes the vaccines useless, then we have to start from the beginning. So you have to watch out for different varients and how effective the vaccines are against them. Until now the vaccines work pretty reliably against all different varients, maybe not as good as in the "original" variant, but still good enough to work and possibly build a herd immunity.</p>
<p>No you are not a science denier. Probably you just didn't even look at the science like most people. But if you don't want to look at the science don't claim that the science is bullshit.</p>

<p>There are variants associated with a virus. They mutate rapidly, it's their evolutionary niche. All vaccines get boosters in response to prominent mutant strains, you're just being a drama queen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Okay, let's talk about cancer treatments then, people who have been on chemo for the last couple of years until the coronavirus hit, and who are therefore immunocompromised enough to not be able to take the vaccine. They are only protected by herd immunity that science deniers are being obstinate over.</p>

<li>
<p>Viruses exist on surfaces, Einstein. They should have taught you that in your pathogens unit of 10th grade biology. And it couldn't POSSIBLY be because your dad had contact with another person, certainly not!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Questioning science is just a hypothesis. You need experimental evidence across multiple trials to make it fact. The existing science has evidence, not just frantically erroneously citing comorbidity death statistics like I know some of you are enamored with doing to justify you being socially ostracized, but actual laboratory trials with confirmatory testing. Believing a hypothesis without testing it isn't science, it's a cult.</p>

<p>Don't let this be the hill you die on, kid. You're going to wake up ten years from now when there are memorials and holidays to millions killed around the world with the words "KILLER" publicly over your shoulders. Change course.</p>

        <p>Sure it sounds like bullshit to you but you know that neither my nor your opinion matters when it comes to what the reality is. I am calculating side effects too, if every person were to get covid or if every person where to get the vaccine, where would there be more death, suffering and side effects in general? If you look at the statistics it's clear that if you get the virus you will suffer alot more than if yoh get a vaccine. In other words vaccine if prefferable to covid.
Now the point with keeping up with all varients is a legit point. You know what keeps the virus from mutating? If it doesn't spread, relpicate itself and thus mutate. What keeps it from spreading? The vaccines. 
Maybe it doesn't make sense to you but let me explain: mutations happen randomly with a very little probablity right? Now let's assume a mutation accures on average every 100 million times it has replicated itself. Now with basic math, the probability of it mutating when infecting hundreds of poeple is way less than the probability of a mutation occuring if it has infected thousands or even millions of people. Thus a great way to stop mutations from occuring is to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Mental health is also a good point, there should have been more support for the mental health of the poeple and that is something you can and should criticize about the way we handled the pandemic. Like I said we didn't handle it perfectly or even something near perfectly. There should be alot more support for mental health right now because people are truly suffering alot more than before the pandemic.
Should somebody not get their medical care because of covid? Hell no that makes 0 sense and in most countries people with serious health issues were able to get their treatment like always, I assume you are from the US and I have to be honest your health care is shit and thus it has impacted you guys differently than most european countries for example. Maybe it's time for you guys to expand healthcare and money flowing into it.
They killed your best years of high school? Yeah same brother, they fucked up my last years of college but you know what? That's not the biggest problem atm. People are dying and just caring about the good time you couldn't have is selfish. Yeah it's bullshit, I know how you feel but like I said our party years, travels etc aren't important compared to human lifes.</p>
<p>What's your point? Just because your dad had it and you mom got vaccinated doesn't mean you know anythinf about the virus or the vaccine.</p>
<p>Yeah no that's not how it works. I know what you mean but your example isn't science, at least not empirical science. Dalton wasn't a scientist, he was a philosopher. He didn't have the equipment and (mathematical/statistics) knowledge to do empricial science. And empirical science doesn't change unless the conditions change in which whatever is being researched. Science discoveries may be refined and further explained but the core of the discoveries don't change. That's why modern science is so great and science has pretty strict standarts on how to do studies and research, most people don't even know of them but if they knew and understood it would change what they thought of as science.</p>

        <p>What do you mean by experimental vaccines? The mRNA vaccines? </p>
<p>Like I explained there were different varients, but there was no point in identifying and differenciating them since all were the same symptom-wise and thus could be handled the same way. Now with the vaccine it does make a difference since you want to know if it work against all or just against one variant, it's important knowledge so we can predict how useful the vaccine is and if it makes sense to take it or not. For examlple if they would've been effective only against 1 variant and we wouldn't develop a immune response against the others, then we know the vaccine wouldn't be really that useful and it definetly wouldn't stop the pandemic. We are lucky because until now it works against all major variants, maybe not to the same degree but they work relatively well. Now if it were to mutate further, the vaccine will probably get less effective and we might have a problem. The important thing is that we know if something like that happens, that's why we differenciate the different varients and are watching out for new variants.</p>
<p>Yeah no not really, in the end they are man made and not absolute. Nature doesn't care about your right and everybody can break your rights if they want to, it's not some holy thing like we keep telling each other. Don't get me wrong they are important, yet they are not something absolute.</p>

        <p>It'a mRNA which is all over in your cells. mRNA is the construction plan for protein and nothing else. 
mRNA vaccines are being research for over 20 years now and no extreme short term or any long term effects have been observed.
It's even more effective and safer than regular vaccines.</p>

<p>Also mRNA vaccines have never been tested on humans, saying this isn't experimental is a blatant lie. We have no data on long term side effects. Stop spreading dangerous minsformation</p>

        <p>Yeah I have. They also have been studied and the data shows they are generally safe but they can lead to symptoms like fever and other normal vaccine side effects which are temporaraly. There is some association with alzheimer but that doesn't mean it's causal.</p>
<p>They have only recently begin testing in humans you are right, yet those few years are enough. Phase 1 clinical trials have been finished, phase 1 is the phase where you determin the safety of the vaccine. The mRNA vaccines thus are safe.
Also scientifically it makes no sense for them not to be safe but that's another point and I'm not going to explain rhat because it would involve my whole semester of biochemistry en cellular biology. </p>
<p>We have data on long term side effects. Long term side effects of vaccines are defined as side effects which occurre 1½ months after taking the vaccine. Those have been studied and there have been no long term side effects observed.</p>

        <p>Holy shit I hope you are joking. No vaccine has a 100% efficacy and no vaccine will stop you from getting the illness with a 100% succes rate.</p>
<p>The mRNA covid vaccine are one the most efficiant vaccines to this date with a efficafy of about 92-94%. For a vaccine to be approved it needs a efficacy of 60%. Smallpox vaccine have a efficacy of about 95%. Those who were vaccinated and still got sick had a much milder version of the disease, like those who get the coronavirus after getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>What isn't well studied is if those who still get infected will be able to transmit the disease to others, yet if there is a 92-94% of not getting it, then this will reduce the total transmission.</p>
<p>And what the hell do you even mean it's not even a real vaccine?</p>
