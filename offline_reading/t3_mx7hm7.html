    <strong>Doomers accept marginal death rate but argue long lasting physical effects of covid?</strong>
    <p><p>I keep hearing doomer myths and legends specifically about young people (the demographic least likely to die of it so of course there’s some psyop to keep young people scared) who got the vid and suffered adverse effects for months afterwards such as constricted breathing, nausea, and other serious ailments. have y’all heard this? I’ve never met or heard of anyone except through the grapevine who got actually detrimentally sick after a positive convid test.</p></p>

        <p>I'm convinced these people are actually living in a different reality at this point. </p>
<p>I've tried to see their side; I've looked for long term detrimental effects in myself after I'm fairly certain I had what they're calling covid. 
I've looked for the effects of the sick and dying on my community. I've seen none. Everybody who was around two years ago is still around. The only difference is the social effects of the restrictions. </p>
<p>My reality does not align with the way they view the world. So, either they're delusional, I'm delusional, or there was a schism in reality and they are actually existing on a different "plane" than we are. </p>
<p>It's strange, because my normally hypochondriac and germophobic mother and sister can see right through this enough to laugh at how absurd the story is.</p>

        <p>I like your take on the different planes. I think existence is pretty subjective in general and I believe to a large extent we create our realities. true belief in something can create an astounding amount of coincidences (providences?) in support of your belief. I’m not an alchemist but I know there many ways of practicing the art in a much more deliberate way than I do. I think many religions try to label it as magic but certainly a fearless state of life is of a higher frequency than the subsistent and anxious way most people live currently</p>
