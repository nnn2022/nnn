        <p>Yep, same shit in Melbourne, Australia. Our Premier Daniel Andrews threatens us day by day with more and more lockdowns if we don't "behave". Every single day it's more and more blackmail, more mandatory restrictions, less freedoms, and somehow it's all "our fault" even though the streets are empty, businesses are all closed, everyone is wearing mandatory masks and staying inside, and we even have the fucking army patrolling our streets to fine people if they're out without a "valid" reason.</p>
<p>Ralph Northam sounds like he's cut from the same cloth. We're witnessing pure evil.</p>

        <p>For the first time in my life, when I watched 1984 the other day I thought “yeah this could happen for sure, and within the next 30 years if ppl don’t wake up.” I’ve always had this distant, vague, “yeah I guess that could happen” attitude about that movie. The other night it was frighteningly realistic.</p>

        <p>Yep very 1984-esque.</p>
<p>My girlfriend is in the middle of reading <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, and she's just getting to the communist/evil/government fascism parts of the book. The parts where things really go wrong and government starts creating more and more rules. She keeps saying to me, "This book is like a mirror to Melbourne right now..."</p>

        <p>Yeah, more rules are going to actually fix anything. It’s insanity. I’m in the states and in a county that has been probably a quarter open the entire time and has been fully open for a couple months now. We’ve had 284 cases and 2 deaths. We aren’t a big county but i would say we have at least 100,000. For this, my autistic son missed months of therapy and social interaction, which caused regression in his behaviors. Now we’ll be going to school for 2 days and home for 3. Only he does HORRIBLY with school work at home. To him it doesn’t make sense, at home he gets to learn about stuff he wants to learn about and at school he learns everything else. He really struggles with the overlap. Which causes a lot of frustration in the entire house. There are places in our county where there isn’t internet and plenty of ppl who can’t afford internet (if it keeps going up that’ll be us too bc it’s already at 70 bucks a month just for internet). So how are all these kids supposed to do school at home? Send them worksheets? Ok cool, what if the parents only read and do math at a 3rd grade level (not out of the realm of possibility) </p>
<p>All for a viral infection that is much more mild that thousands of others. This wasn’t something we knew absolutely nothing about, there are like 16 other coronaviruses. Only it burned through Italy we had the needed data. When it was all the way over in Italy I told my husband we would probably see about 200,000 deaths in the state until they stopped reporting every single death to the public and start treating it more like the “slightly deadly than the flu” viral infection it is. (I did expect that but what’s happened is so far beyond what even I could’ve imagined. I imagined some panic but this is insanity) That was my estimate without the lockdowns (outside of the first 2 week lockdown to prep hospitals). Because locking down healthy people doesn’t stop death. And you can never lock down enough to prevent the spread unless you pull a NZ. But honestly, I feel like NZ is an exception. You need to focus on protecting the vulnerable and let everyone else continue society.</p>

<p>&rt;It seems that [coronavirus] may be the greatest question of the modern era around civil liberties, around the right to privacy. Yet no one's asking this question.</p>
<p>&rt;<strong>As authoritarianism spreads, as emergency laws proliferate, as we sacrifice our rights, we also sacrifice our capability to arrest the slide into a less liberal and less free world</strong>. Do you truly believe that when the first wave, this second wave, the 16th wave of the coronavirus is a long-forgotten memory, that these capabilities will not be kept? That these datasets will not be kept? No matter how it is being used, what’ is being built is the architecture of oppression.</p>

        <p>Yeah I was saying this shit back in bloody APRIL and people were calling me a god damn conspiracy theorist. I was literally saying, "When the virus comes back, won't we just have to have more lockdowns?" Everyone called me a nutjob, "No of course not, they can't lock us down twice, you're exaggerating and fear-mongering". When all I was doing was asking questions. And then lo and behold, we're now in a second, almost-permanent lockdown.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately there are people who cannot, and they are some of the most vulnerable... so much for caring about the vulnerable. </p>
<p>People have already killed themselves. Clients of mine came close after attempts. Friend's clients did die. I know people personally who died by suicide. More have died by suicide in a normal year during this time, than by this virus, and they represent <strong><em>young</em></strong> lives. Suicide had absolutely increased in attempts and deaths just in my area (I work in mental health and just from those we can count among ourselves more have died than we would expect during this time period and more locally than from this virus).</p>
<p>I am so done with people. I am trying but it's increasingly hard. Any hope given is taken away because we are bad little virus spreaders.</p>

        <p>Is this going to go on forever?! Four whole people died in an entire state of eight million yesterday. Four! I just can’t understand how the metric went from keep the hospitals from collapsing to, get cases down to zero? And furthermore most of Virginia’s cases are in Southern VA. </p>

        <p>Yep I’m in the same state. We have been fortunate we can enjoy more normal life (so far) compared to some other places but this guy is catering to the most terrified doomers out there and making threats. VA is not “surging” and we are not running out of capacity. </p>
<p>I hope if he does something drastic there is mass defiance. I’m sure there are many counties outside of nova that will refuse to comply.</p>

        <p>There are freaks on that twitter thread calling for phase one?! </p>
<p>Why can’t these people stay home at this point and leave the rest of us alone. Honestly it’s getting ridiculous. This isn’t March. Even if they close businesses, (normal) people are not going to social distance like they did early on. You still have plenty of “essential” places open like Walmart so the virus will keep spreading. Don’t know what fantasy land these people live in.</p>

        <p>There are people in my neighborhood who think we should lock down indefinitely. I’m not being reckless but I’m living my life as close to normal as possible; I can understand in March being afraid because the unknowns were numerous. But in almost August, I’m over it. I’m seeing friends, going to target normally, all of it. We have to learn to live with the virus like <em>every other illness in existence.</em></p>

        <p>Yes it’s unfortunate but death and disease are a part of life. We could lock down “indefinitely” and during that time you could get cancer or some other disease. I’ll wear a mask in places like grocery stores and keep my distance from strangers. But otherwise I’m not going to “self isolate” and going to go about living my life....because life is meant to be lived. At this point I think we all have the basic human right to assume our own risk. If others want to hide out at home so be it. </p>
<p>We need to get over it and treat it like any other disease, which means we can still address it but don’t need to burn civilization to the ground doing so.</p>

        <p>Virginia's recall method is done through the courts, and so for all practical purposes, there is no way to recall an elected official.  Add to that the way that the Virginia governor is limited to a single term in office (i.e. they are out after four years no matter what they do), and you come to realize that the sitting governor is accountable to no one.  If you want to make the governor more accountable, allow them to stand for reelection, and make them answer to their constituents for their actions in order to keep their job.</p>

        <p>So what's the answer then? Sit around and wait until November when he'll use his emergency powers to  cancel the state election and secure power for himself indefinitely? Recalling him isn't about the term, it's about taking away power from him immediately, or ASAP.</p>
