    <strong>#NONEWNORMAL DEBATE/DISCUSSION</strong>
    <p><p>Okay, so first things first. I just want to say, please dont come here with any propoganda, please dont force your opinion down somebodys throat. </p>
<p>All i ask is that if you participate in this debate, that you stay active and reply to any comments or questions you may have directed your way.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is to critically and collectively discuss what is going on. I think its about time something like this happened. Seeing as we cant legally gather and converse in any other way i hope this provides a chance for people to really discuss and understand the whole situation in the hopes we can truly understand it. </p>
<p>So... without further ado, here is MY (MINE, MOI, ME) opinion, i dont want anybody to be influenced and targeted by what i have to say.</p>
<p>To begin with, i want to look at the information laid out to us by the social media (as far as i can remember).</p>
<p>When this whole ordeal started, i specifically remember Dr. Fauci saying masks dont work..... and now its wear two/three. Okay.... fair enough, alot can change in a year. New information is presented... but now i want to adress the big elephant in the room. This vaccine has also been progressed and developed within (currently under) 1 year. So, we want to risk our lives to a vaccine that has no real long term studies. </p>
<p>So in speculation... 100,000 people take the vaccine. And 8 months from now, new research comes out and informs us (this is a speculation/theory) that it has some side effects/whatever. Just imagine they come out with research to suggest it "can" cause problems. Is that not unfair to the 100,000? is there compensation? are we then able to sue and demand justice to the vaccine companies for this?</p>
<p>Then that lead me to another thing, these vaccines producers are paid and endorsed by the government. The media also promotes the vaccine as good, i don't watch the news but from what i remember they were never keen on highlighting possible side effect etc. To me they were all so obsessed with the idea a pandemic is happening instead of thinking for themselves that they promote the vaccine as all good. This is a straight up bias. Alot of people depends on the news and the information it gives us. Alot of people live by it as fact (whatever the news man says is real and fact)...lol. This is not fair, people need to be more informed. </p>
<p>So to just quickly wrap this up, i dont think there is enough: honesty, clarity and discussion going on with this situation. All the governement bodies are in offices making our decisions for us whilst we remain in a tyrannical lockdown that was not voted for but instead forced upon is. </p>
<p>To me, it seems factual this is against our rights. I really believe the news/tv is a brainwashing tool to stop people living their life how they really should. The government narrative is being forced down our throats without question. Some people aren't even aware of this. </p>
<p>They buy a tv... its now there's. they tune it to an antenna and it comes with this strange channel called the news... and on that channel they like to tell you what to do, what to say, how to think, how to act and etc. </p>
<p>I just need this to be looked at independently and resourcefully by you guys in the comments, i am only one guy. Quite frankly, i am on this sub everyday and i just need to be sure we are all on the same wavelength. We cant push a truth to the people if we dont even know what the truth is. We need to work together, anti-maskers, maskers, anti vax, vaxxers, we all need to collectively work together in some way so we can truly think and understands ourselves what's going on.</p>
<p>We should no longer rely on the news, i try my best to stay neutral, to hear both sides, its a fact people have died, its a fact those deaths have been labelled covid, but there's so much more to it than that as all of us here know. So i hope this inspires some serious discussion.</p></p>

        <p>Covid-19 is newest flu rebranded and used by the elite to become richer and suppress people. The media hyped it up and enough people bought it. They tried to do it with the mexican flu but didn't succeed, not enough smartphones and no real way to infobomb the masses. </p>
<p>Meanwhile our leaders conspire with NGO's and multinationals to rebrand the world to China 2.0</p>
<p>What's there to discuss really?</p>

        <p>this is the point of view/ information i lacked. thanks for sharing, this really put it into perspective. i was close with my own research, i saw they wanted us to basically be like china where the government and tech literally control everything. how do we stop it tho&rt;</p>

        <p>Hijack their plans and execute them ourselves.</p>
<p>The world doesn't need a reset. It's just the top that needs a reset. They are the reason capitalism is at its end. They keep steeling away our money and leave us with less and less. </p>
<p>Make capitalism healthy again by resetting the elite.</p>

<p>That's how it has always been. A regular citizen has no say into how the world is run. You just notice it now, because the response has been so extreme.</p>
