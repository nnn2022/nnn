        <p>&rt; IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SOMPO HOLDINGS</p>
<ul>
<li>SOMPO Holdings, Inc. is a Japanese insurance holdings company. It is listed on the Nikkei 225. The firm is considered one of three top insurers in Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, TIME has been reduced to "opinion journalism" and is allowing a paid-political hit piece to promote acquiescence to authority.</p>

        <p>This one is the worst, more fun future predictions:</p>
<p><a href="https://time.com/collection/great-reset/5900739/fix-economy-by-2023/">https://time.com/collection/great-reset/5900739/fix-economy-by-2023/</a></p>
<p>&rt;In the summer of 2022, the other major crisis of our age took a turn for the apocalyptic. Climate breakdown finally landed in the developed world, testing the resilience of social systems. In the Midwestern U.S., a severe drought wiped out crops that supplied one-sixth of the world‚Äôs grain output. People woke up to the need for governments to form a coordinated response to climate change and direct global fiscal stimulus in support of a green economy.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;[...]<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti successfully turned one lane of the 405 freeway into a bicycle lane and broke ground in late 2022 on a zero-carbon underground metro system, free at the point of use. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;And so we stand here in 2023 the same people but in a different society. COVID-19 convinced us we could not go back to business as usual. The world has embraced a ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù that ensures public-private collaborations are driven by public interest, not private profit</p>

        <p>There was a time when the voice of the people mattered (at least a little) because they paid for  subscriptions. As paid subscriptions decline, print media has to replace that income if they want to stay in business.</p>
<p>That means nearly all journalism is there to sell you something - more now than ever. It might be a product, but often it's an 'idea' which is part of a bigger agenda... But it all leads to more money &amp; power for whoever paid for the article which is really covert advertising or propaganda.</p>
<p>Again, this has always been a thing -- but now it's ubiquitous. It's every article you read, everything you see or hear...</p>
<p>That's what the "PARTNERSHIP WITH SOMPO HOLDINGS" is about. I guess all this is obvious to anyone on this subreddit, but it's shocking how few people understand what is happening. The average person thinks "news" is "news."</p>

        <p>Excellent post! </p>
<p>The internet has become a giant propaganda machine. What's interesting tho, is eventually the propaganda becomes too much and has the opposite effect of it's purpose... It turns readers out of it, like you witnessed in the past few years with the social media platforms. Twitter and facebook stopped reporting how many users they have, and have become extremely desperate to the point where their running amok letting bots and shills dominate the vast majority of communications on their platforms. The more they head down that road, the more human browsing decreases.</p>
<p>It's the same with the "news" and propaganda networks, since the majority of their revenues have dried up in recent years, in order to survive they have been reduced to catering to special interest groups... Political, corporate or ideological propaganda is the only way for them to earn the revenue needed to stay afloat. </p>
<p>I would even argue that the reason why such platforms even exist and are still in business, is special interest groups and rich billionaires keep them afloat for their modern day propaganda traits... All that is dying anyways, propaganda really took a hit in the second half of 2020, the deep state over reached and exposed themselves</p>
