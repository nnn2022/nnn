    <strong>WE NEED TO MAKE A DECISION &amp; SOON</strong>
    <p><p>This is an attack on our liberty and those eho can't see it by now are deluded. Remember, just 2 weeks to stop the spread? Remember the WHO telling us not to wear a mask at the height of the first wave? How many coincidenes does it take before we realise our liberties have been destroyed in the name of a virus slightly more deadlier than the flu.</p>
<p>We rather save those who are edging towards the end of their life and pay with our liberty or we continue as normal, retake our human rights and risk people dying. </p>
<p>This is a decision we made when fighting facism and tryanny throughout two world wars. Your choice. Men and women died in the name of freedom. </p>
<p>We will NOT return to normal without making tough decisions.</p>
<p>Remember, when the government claim to want to keep you safe. It isn't free, it comes at a cost of your liberty. GOOD LUCK getting that back in full once the crisis passes.</p>
<p>Post 9/11, when we mailicously had our communications monitored without our consent in the name of keeping you safe. You paid with your liberty.. Goverments and people of power have done "bad" things since the beginning of time. Just because you're far to busy inulging in Netflix or focusing too much on your shitty rat race sales job doesn't mean it's disappeared.</p>
<p>STOP focusing on one dimensional COVID cases and deaths. Expand your brain a look at the bigger picture. COVID isn't the only virus in the world right now, it's actually the LEAST of our worries. The precedent these undemocratic restrictions set for the future. The political censorship. We're all going to be biting from the saame narrative and anone who dissents against the narrative will be silenced.</p>
<p>Is this a future you want for the next generation? It will be, if we continue to indulge in a false sense of security.</p></p>

        <p>We <em>should</em> organize and we <em>should</em> take over 'our' governments.</p>
<p>It's not going to happen though.</p>
<p>And protesting on the streets? They'll let people do it; it's a political correct way of saying you don't agree, but they really don't care, unless their own lifes are at risk.</p>

        <p>The capitol storming was a good start, even if it was for the wrong reason (at face value anyway). The people who keep coming out with more and more draconian rules need to know who all of this ultimately affects. And if another building needs to be stormed, so be it.</p>
