        <p>Funny because Ben was pretty much pro lockdown at the beginning.  So now after you advocated for these policies and the damage is done and you realize you're on the wrong side you try to pretend you're against this stuff. Cool</p>

        <p>Huh didn't know that. I had never watched him before this video. It randomly popped in my recommended today. That totally explains why he sympathized with their decision to do it at first though. I thought that was a little odd. Thanks for letting me know.</p>

        <p>If I didn’t listen to Shapiro more often I would’ve assumed like you did that he was anti lockdown earlier on. Unfortunately he’s more recently anti lockdown. I was disappointed in that</p>

        <p>Also the mere act of changing sides so quickly goes against Shapiro’s main message. Shapiro is someone whose argumentation relies on pointing out contradictions and illogic in leftist thinking, and being for lockdowns earlier on but not now is a huge switch that weakens his legitimacy, IMO.</p>

        <p>Like he said in his video, he was for them at first (which I think most everyone was, given they expected millions dead and didn't know how crazy it would or could be). But now that we have more data, Ben says we should stop lockdowns for reasons as stated in his video</p>
<p>I'd say most on this channel agree with that current sentiment, at least to the extent that we should wear masks and really try pushing to reopen, safely where possible. As I believe Trump warned early on, we shouldn't let the cure/prevention be worse than the disease itself, which it has been imo.</p>
<p>Lastly, people are allowed to change their minds. That shouldn't come as a shock to ppl. It's should be encouraged actually, since it's worse to stubbornly hold a view if you later find it's wrong or needs correcting</p>

        <p>No, most were not for them early on.  Many of us could see from day one this was horseshit and the virus wasn't very dangerous and that politicians were desperate to be seen as saviors.  From day one the misinformation and straight up lies especially from state governors was obvious.  So, I kind of have a problem with anyone who ever bought into this bullshit even for one second.</p>
<p>Plus Ben is pro mask so really this guy can go fuck himself, he doesn't have even a fraction of the intelligence he believes he has.</p>

        <p>Last I checked masks were shown to limit the amount of virus you expel. You have definitive proof against wearing masks at all?</p>
<p>I agree covid has a lot of political bias in it. Suspected false positives, etc. So I agree w Ben on the moderate approach, no lockdowns, let's reopen, but try to do so safely.  You seem to be on the extreme side that covid is not really a thing and masks should not be worn at all. What's your best evidence for this to turn public opinion to that viewpoint?</p>

        <p>Take a look at spain where they've been wearing masks for months but now have per capita infections higher than US peak and still rising (also france, peru, California and many more).  Then look at Sweden where no one wears masks.  If you don't consider this proof that masks aren't effective then you're anti science.</p>

        <p>Exactly, I actually supported the earlier lockdowns because I honestly didn't know what we were dealing with here, especially seeing what was going on in March and April. But now, it's clear they're crap. So I can see why Ben would've changed course, because I did too. But honestly I was kind of surprised he wasn't against it all earlier on given his leanings.</p>
<p>At this point there is IMO absolutely no excuse for supporting lockdowns. Or still going with thinking that cases = death sentences or hospitalizations.</p>

        <p>I don't follow Ben Shapiro closely but I believe that he is mainstream enough so that his message can reach a substantial part of the population.</p>
<p>At this point the data and arguments are out there. I can't fathom how any thinking person can support the destruction that lockdowns cause, anywhere in the world.</p>
