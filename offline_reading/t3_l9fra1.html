    <strong>The old people being locked up in retirement prisons are victims of this as well.</strong>
    <p><p>I see many comments along the lines of <em>"and all this so that granny can live 5 months longer"</em>. And while the reasoning makes sense, it also implies old people would be profiting from this.</p>
<p>But if you look at their situation, they are just as much victimized like the younger ones - at least the ones caged in "care"-facilities, and to a large degree in even worse circumstances as they could more easily be forced to get the injections by their caretakers and are completely separated from their family, which is especially important in their situation as their lives were already very bland before all of this. </p>
<p>And it also gives the caretakers much more power and opportunities for abuse - without anyone from outside looking regularly how things are going.</p>
<p>So all of this is just a pretense, the only ones not loosing out but actually profiting off of this (and immensely so) are the fascists in power and the people owning the mega-corporations.</p></p>

        <p>It's disgusting. Once again we treat seniors as if they're not people. Has anyone even bothered asking them if they want to be spending their last years alone? I imagine some would because they're afraid, but others wouldn't, and to pretend like they are all okay with this is just sick.</p>

        <p>Oh absolutely. I'm a geriatric social worker. What we are doing to our elderly population is cruel and inhumane. For the seniors still living at home, the cancellation of adult daycare and senior centers for the past year has been devastating. These are people who often live alone, are technologically illiterate, are hard of hearing, and are already very socially isolated. I hate to say it but I'm glad all my grandparents are dead so they didn't live to see this shit.</p>

        <p>My neighbor is the sweetest 91 year old woman. Her 91 year old husband is in memory care, all he likes to do is go for a walk outside every day. He is no longer allowed to go outside due to Covid. He calls his wife daily to get him out. This whole thing is so wrong!</p>

        <p>Well, I would argue that in the first place they are victims of the culture which puts them in old people's storage when they're too inconvenient, but yeah, the entire pandemic circus definitely adds to their misery</p>

        <p>This is why I've put my life on hold to help my grandma stay out of a home. My aunt and I are with her all the time. She's almost 100 but luckily in great shape for her age.</p>
<p>She keeps saying "I never thought I'd live to see something like this. Never in the United States of America"</p>
<p>We go out to breakfast every morning, she gets her hair done once a week, and we go wherever she wants. If the woman wants breakfast at a restaurant, damn it she gets breakfast at a restaurant.</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of elderly people that don't have this luxury because of medical issues. It's heartbreaking.</p>

        <p>I had a chance to see my grandpa a few weeks ago, and the isolation was clearly taking a toll on him. </p>
<p>He kept the TV on way too much, so was getting bombarded by propaganda from the media about the freedom fighters who stormed the Capitol. Being a former police officer, those events must’ve triggered flashbacks from the 60s for him.</p>

        <p>Oh absolutely. Others are wasting away in total isolation, often not understanding why they don’t get visits anymore. It breaks my heart.</p>

        <p>Yeah, their situations are even worse because they can barely go outside or see anyone, while we can go outside to places like skating rinks and parks and see whatever arbitrary number of people some government decided to let us see that month.</p>

        <p>Yep these in nursing homes are but not these on pension with their huge apartments and many vacation homes.</p>
<p>These people barely do stuff anyway so these restrictions don't affect them much.</p>

        <p>Absolutely true that our seniors are getting the shitty end of the stick here and even previous to the pandemic. However, simply sparing them from death via covid isn’t the only consequence of isolating nursing home residents. What’s more relevant to the population overall, I think, is the amount of resources &amp; bed-space they would require at hospitals if no steps were taken to prevent infection among them. The median age of nursing home residents is ~85, for which, if infected, the rate of illness severe enough to require hospitalization is over 20% iirc, and considering the close quarters they are so often in would lead to very high infection rates, that would be a huge additional strain on an already stressed healthcare system. Most importantly, non-covid related health emergencies haven’t stopped just because of the pandemic; we still need enough availability in healthcare resources to attend to emergencies like car accidents, strokes, poisonings, allergic reactions, etc. at essentially the same rates that we always have. This fact seems to be totally unconsidered by most, and is also the central flaw of the ‘I’m not worried about a virus with 1% death rate’ mentality. 1% death rate isn’t the point, it’s that a great deal more than just those who die will need to be hospitalized, especially when no efforts to mitigate the infection rate are taken, resulting in more cases; meaning if, say, you have a spinal/head injury, or your toddler swallows a household cleaner, there’s a damn good chance you’ll be waiting longer for emergency services and receiving less attention. This is a major reason why there’s been such an increase in excess deaths not related to covid since the pandemic began, a fact of which so many seem blissfully unaware of or content ignoring. So, as far as nursing home residents, I really don’t see any good solution if they have nowhere else to go and be cared for :/ we should be giving more attention to both issues, but for the average American this isn’t about critical thinking.</p>
