    <strong>My great grandma died of covid 19</strong>
    <p><p>She was almost 100 years old, lived in such a small village in Poland that it's not even on the map. She lived with her 3 kids, worked on their farm and almost never visit the city except when they really really have to.
The woman was made of pure steel, at almost 100 years old she would still cut crops with a scythe, carry heavy stuff with no problem, sprint and could out drink any man I've ever met.</p>
<p>One day she felt dizzy, and as you should at that age she went to the doctor to check if she's ok.
They said she has covid.
They took her to a hospital against although she said she felt fine. They took her to the covid ward and as they were talking her the last thing we ever heard her say was "let go of me you fucking assholes".</p>
<p>She was pronounced dead 4 hours later, cause of death: covid 19</p>
<p>I don't even know what to fucking say, she was murdered</p>
<p>Her kids weren't even allowed at her funeral because they said they were contaminated</p></p>

        <p>My grandfather went to the hospital for a UTI and ended up in the COVID ward. It’s like the Hotel California, you can check in, but you’re never gonna get to leave. He died about a month later. You’re right, it is murder. I’m sorry for your loss.</p>

        <p>It wasn't covid </p>
<p>If anything, it was the respirators they hooked her up to</p>
<p>They're killing off the old generation because they are the holders of the most the world's wealth; and also because they're the only ones who know what the old-world governments and secret organizations are capable of, and how to defend against a new world order. </p>
<p>There was a college humor skit that aired like 4 years ago that predicted a disease that would wipe out the older generation because of the reasons I gave; and how it would be the perfect crime, because "how would you prove it?"</p>
<p>I haven't been able to find the skit, or I would paste the link here.</p>

        <p>First of all, I'm sorry your great grandma passed away. Even when you know someone could pass away any moment because of their age, losing a family member is still hard to go through.</p>
<p>If she had no contact with it at all then they put covid on her death certificate because they used a PCR test to get a guaranteed false positive so they can drive the numbers up and keep people in fear. They get these guaranteed false positives by increasing the number of cycles the test is run at. The inventor of the PCR test himself said the test is useless to determine if someone has an infection or not. They run it at 40+ cycles and at that cycle rate, put the test in an orange and it will come up positive for covid. When they want negative results so they can say their efforts are working, they lower the cycle rate down to about 28-35 cycles.</p>

        <p>I'm happy to see that little by little this is leaking out on the MSM.</p>
<p>Don't want to get too excited but I'm seeing signs of desperation from those in power now that exposure of the scam is slowly being revealed. Like how it's now being considered that the Wuhan lab might have had more responsibility in this mess than they let on originally.</p>
<p>That's no longer relegated to the fringes of conspiracy theory.</p>

        <p>My boyfriend's grandma was vaccinated against Covid like a month ago... Since the beginning she avoided Covid like a boss but there, after the vaccine, she got Covid. She felt mostly fine, but then her oxygen levels dropped so they took her to the hospital. She started to get worse. She was arguing with the family and the doctors to be released home. She was released a couple of days later, and suddenly she feels better at home. My boyfriend went on a rent of how the hospitals and their "care" are only making things worse and killing people. We know now that ventilators increase the chances of death in Covid patients... Those fucking doctors were talking about putting her on a ventilator</p>
