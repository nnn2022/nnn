        <p>&rt; This report is based on a survey of 1,400 people affected by conflict and displacement in eight countries, and more detailed surveys and needs assessment in a total of 14 countries. The  Norwegian  Refugee  Council  (NRC)  research  found  that  these  communities  have  suffered  widespread  loss  of  income  since  the  pandemic started. In NRC’s survey, 77 per cent responded that that they had lost a job or income from work, temporarily or permanently since March.</p>

I hope things get back to normal soon,” she told NRC</p>

        <p>&rt; This  predicted  impact  is  already  being  profoundly  felt  by  those  surveyed. Of those that said they had previously received money from family members abroad, nearly two thirds (62 per cent) said they were now receiving less than before the pandemic.</p>

        <p>&rt; Less than seven per cent of respondents to NRC’s multi-country survey stated that they had received more assistance from non-governmental organisations or governments since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pan-demic, while over 28 per cent reported receiving less, likely because of government shutdowns and restrictions on humanitarian operations over this period.22</p>

        <p>&rt; Country case study: Burkina Faso<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Government restrictions in Burkina Faso to curb the spread of Covid-19 have included a 7pm to 5am curfew; the closure of the airport, borders, schools, restaurants, churches and mosques; and a quarantine of affected areas.Covid-19 restrictions have had a severe impact on the movement of fresh produce, agricultural production and livestock, and have led to a reduction in income. Combined with low rainfall and armed violence, which has caused more than one million people to flee their homes24, the pandemic is worsening a critical humanitarian situation.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Hunger levels are rising dangerously in the country. More than 2.1 million people do not have enough food to eat, equivalent to over one in ten people in the country. This is a dramatic increase of 213 per cent compared to last year.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;At least 372,000 children under 5 years old, and 88,500 pregnant or breastfeeding women and girls, are acutely malnourished in the Sahel, Centre-Nord, Est, Centre-Est, Nord, Boucle du Mouhoun and Centre-Ouest regions.</p>
