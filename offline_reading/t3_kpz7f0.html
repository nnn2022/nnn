    <strong>I think everyone here knows the potential answer here.. but..</strong>
    <p><p>In the past there’s been no test for “the common cold” and you only get tested for the flu if you go to a doctor AND have symptoms (hmm...) so.. what if there was no covid test.. and the average person who was “exposed” to someone with the flu got tested whether they have symptoms or not... wonder what the results would be... I have a pretty good guess.</p>
<p>Edit: corrected a fat finger.</p></p>

        <p>We wouldn't even blink an eye to be honest, maybe chalk it up to the flu being a bit bad this year versus others</p>

        <p>Well if we did the same thing for flu there would certainly be a heck of a lot more flu cases you’d be hearing about. I’d say 99% of them go undiagnosed.</p>

        <p>The reason why covid is not like the common cold is that it has much different effects on the human body than the numerous viruses that cause the common cold. This is why the doctors originally coming across covid did not diagnosis it as a cold or influenza. This is when it was identified as a novel corona type virus that likely originated as an animal virus and spread to affect humans.</p>
<p>The virus causes similar symptoms as the flu, but is much more deadly. Of the people who are symptomatic with the virus, around 1% die, mostly effecting those of advanced age or poor health, but also sometimes fatal to the otherwise healthy. </p>
<p>Coronavirus is not like the common cold, but it is also not like the horrible pandemic illnesses we see in apocalyptic TV shows and movies. It's a virus that spreads through human to human contact and it has fatal effects to the elderly and other members of our society, </p>
<p>The effects of this new virus have been felt worldwide as different governments and communities take different approaches to handling the new virus.</p>
<p>No one know what the perfect solution is to this problem, but digging our head in the sand, thinking it's a hoax, and thinking basic safety precautions like mask wearing is tyranny, is not in anyway helpful in dealing with this virus.</p>

        <p>Governments “dealing” with a virus is like saying they could stop an incoming hurricane.  We live in a time where correlation=causation when in politicians favor and when it doesn’t it’s all us stupid plebs faults.  The virus is a killer but what it’s killed the most is reason and logic.</p>
