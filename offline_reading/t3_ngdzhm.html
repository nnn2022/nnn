    <strong>Just giving everyone here a heads up.</strong>
    <p><p>With regards to Rand Paul calling out Fauci, the PCR tests not working and therefore should not be used, the election, the masks, basically everything that has happened over the last year and a half has already been uncovered, talked about, and discussed at length in other subreddits over a year ago. </p>
<p>So. For the last year (at least), people have been slowly waking up but I'm here to tell you, there are groups that ALWAYS talk about this stuff. There are groups who DO NOT go with the narritive EVER. There are groups who have always know about the MEDIA being PROPAGANDA by LAW. There are groups that knew about the VEARS vaccine reporting system and the indemnity of vaccine companies, There are groups that knew about the Corporation of the United States and have been working to bring this to light for years. There are groups who know about JFK, GHWB, 911, Pearl Harbor, The gulf of Tonkin, etc etc. </p>
<p>If you, the reader of this, has EVER called someone a <strong><em>Conspiracy Theorist</em></strong>, a Kook, crazy, lunatic etc for speaking out on behalf of any NUMBER of these instances, <strong>you own that person an apology like you would not believe.</strong></p>
<p>This is what you say, even a text would be fine:</p>
<p>"Dear friend, I am SO SORRY I didn't not listen to you sooner. You were right, I was wrong. You knew information that was accurate and I was following the mainstream story. Not anymore, YOU woke me up. I own you everything. Please forgive me."</p>
<p>This will go very far in mending relationships that YOU may have damaged over this last year(few years). Don't expect the people who attempted to wake up a sleeping fool to call you and cast more pearls before swine. </p>
<p>Thank you, your soul will feel better.</p></p>

        <p>Yeah 2020 was a litmus test for intelligence, common sense, and critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>It's time for new family, new friends.</p>
<p>Who needs people who will turn on you like they did?  The whole experience gave me some sense of understanding about what pre-war Germany must have been like.</p>
<p>These people would have gone along with <em>anything</em> they were told.</p>

        <p>Someone’s mad they went off ranting about all things conspiracy and lost their friends. I’ve had plenty of polite and heated debates with both likeminded friends and those with opposing beliefs. We are still friends. Nobody owes you an apology. Maybe you’re just rude and demanding so your “relationships were damaged”.</p>

        <p>Weird, I've never had a conspiracy theorist apologize to me for being wrong about something, like when they said Jade Helm was a commie take over by Obama or when they said Hillary would go to prison or when they said the earth was flat or when they said covid would "disappear on November 5th" or when they said William Barr was going to arrest the deep state, etc etc etc etc....</p>

        <p>Half of those people are shills trying to make us look like lunatics by association anyways. The other half just have paranoid schizophrenia lol. I've seen people shilling the magnet trick after the vaccine here recently.. again, more shilling to distract from the root problem.</p>
