    <strong>Question: How Did People Deal With Immunocompromised Friends &amp; Family Prior To 2020?</strong>
    <p><p>I understand that with postmodernist philosophies like CRT and Intersectionality, being a victim of someone else's actions/race/beliefs/etc is venerated. Since last year, being immunocompromised is treated like a special privilege and benefit for which we must ALL alter our lives. For example, western developed countries do not vaccinate their citizenry against TB but the US alone has 13M people who are infected with TB and are ticking time bombs waiting to detonate when their immune systems are eventually weakened. Why don't we have mandatory BCG policies to protect the immunocompromised from TB?</p>
<p>I have a grandfather who had terminal stage 4 cancer (completely healed now) who was not a hypochondriac who wanted to avoid all contact with other humans because of the risk of getting an infection. He's well into his 80s today and has got no room for masks, social distancing and vaccines.</p>
<p>How did you deal with immunocompromised  family and friends before 2020?</p></p>

        <p>Immunocompromised are responsible for their own health just like every person is. </p>
<p>My mom has secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (caused by the DTP vaccine in 1982) and would die of near any infection. During cold and flu season she needs to be somewhat careful, and she takes care of her immune system. She hasn't gotten sick in years and years despite being more susceptible than near anyone. </p>
<p>Thinking that your own health is the responsibility of anyone other than yourself is so unbelievably self centered and narcissistic it's unbelievable.</p>
