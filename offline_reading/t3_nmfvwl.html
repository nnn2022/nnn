    <strong>What do you tell your pro-vaxx friends?</strong>
    <p><p>EDIT: Pro-<strong>COVID</strong>-Vaxx  ;-)</p>
<p>Honest question.</p>
<p>What do you tell your convid cult friends? </p>
<p>So I have a group of friends that I haven’t seen in over a year.  They’re all pretty liberal, and my best friend basically worships science.  I’ve talked with her about my concerns before, she listened but of course managed to compartmentalize our conversation and went ahead with the vaccine anyway. </p>
<p>So a few months later she sent me a text wanting to meet up with our friend group for brunch.  She then says, “hey question for you... are you full vaccinated yet?”  And i respond, “oh no, but I can wear a mask it’s no big.”</p>
<p>Her response is “You might have to ask [our friend] then if she is okay with it. Personally, I don't care that much because I'm way past post 2-week vaccination. However, [our friend] has gotten her 2nd, but isn't past 2 weeks. But anyway, get your shot, girl”</p>
<p>Ughhh. </p>
<p>I’m so over this.  Apparently all my friends are knee deep in the propaganda and brainwashing.</p>
<p>So I went ahead and texted our other friend.  I don’t know what else I can do about it if they’re scared.  Im not going to lie to anyone though.  Maybe I should but my friendship is built on honesty so...</p></p>

        <p>They are not smart.</p>
<p>They are just indoctrinated extremely well. They only see one path that they have been following their entire life. Highschool and college are weapons of propaganda.</p>
<p>To make them question "science" and "education" is impossible. It would completely destroy their consciousness and subconsciousness.</p>

        <p>I was a university drop-out (couldn't hack it), and I always felt depressed about that, feeling really dumb and stupid all my life. I went to college afterwards taking some practical courses to help me do more maintenance type jobs, then joined the work force. I get paid lower than the national average, but at least I'm happy doing what I do. But the one thing I always kept in mind was to have an open mind about things, never judge others, and try to learn on my own to make myself a better person. Sometimes I'd meet a real prick who was super rich or super smart, and they'd make me feel like shit, but I just figured they live in a world that I would never want to live in. I hope smarter people than me can wake-up soon, as we need more to speak-up about how science is being abused and the truth hidden from us.</p>

        <p>Don't go around advertising it, but when asked, always tell the truth. If they keep pushing, just take some time off from that friendship. If God has mercy on us and the world doesn't end this time, all this will go away. People will move on to talk about about Friends reunion or something.</p>

        <p>Don’t we have a moral obligation, as citizens, to protect our fertility and long term health?  There’s many ways you could cut this pie.  None of them are thinking in the long term.  </p>
<p>No one has a “duty” to be a guinea pig.  No one should be taking unreasonable risks to health or safety.  And we can’t assess those risks because we don’t know what they are.

        <p>I agree, all of us have a moral obligation to protect our fertility, our loved ones, and our overall health from these experimental gene-altering devil-spawn concoctions. </p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nmfvpe/i_think_the_shot_causes_people_to_shed_something/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>did you see this</strong></a>? Like, holy guacamole! Fucking hell man, I would never have thought the NWO would be <em>that</em> evil in pre-planning to have those vaccinated become walking contagion units of this super virus. Jesus... </p>
<p>I've already been outed at work as anti-covid-vaxx (I'm pro-health and pro-common sense), and when my spirits were down you lifted them up with those David Paulides video links, as well as you wrote very nice things to cheer me up. You lifted my spirits, so I feel invigored to continue fighting. Thank you! 🙏🙏 The best I can do is prepare my finances (ugh!), as well as be prepared for a legal fight if my company tries to lay me off due to not being vaxxed. It's criminal and inhumane. My company says "follow the science", but I told a few at work that management only follows the MSM's "selective science". (barf! 🤢🤮)</p>
<p>Guess this weekend is going to be intense. More protests planned in my neck of the woods. Hope the coppers don't bring out the riot squad goons. Those fuckers can be pretty brutal.</p>

        <p>How good of friends are you really then?  One of my best friends is as liberal as it gets and doesn't care that I'm not at all.  He understands just fine that my family had complications and understands that if its supposed to work he is protected.  He's just not an asshole. We could make a different argument if it was fda approved and like all the other vaccines we've had.  It's unfortunate they're scared of this still but I understand, it's just too bad you can't be included now because of fear.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry you're going through this with your friends. I'm going to be "that" guy, but you need to either make new friends, or just tell them straight that you feel uncomfortable taking any of these rushed-out covid-vaxx shots (heck, we won't know the true details until the FDA receives the final results from Pfizer in 2023!).</p>
<p>No one, and I mean no one has power over you. You control your own life. They can't belittle, shame, mock, coerce or force you into taking the shot. So ditch them if you feel you're being harassed or bugged by them. </p>
<p>One thing I don't recommend is lying. Lying to placate your friends only builds new lies, which will eventually balloon to tremendous proportions, so better just say "No, don't feel like taking the shot. Bye!" Like, if you were in an extremely uncomfortable situation, and the only way out was to lie to get away to be safe, then go for it (unless of course the person(s) you're lying to challenge you on your claim). But in any case, I'm tired of placating to others. I've lost so many "friends" (ha! good riddance) that I just DGAF anymore. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

        <p>personally i don't have pro covid vax friends but if i did, either we would respect each other's perspectives and not let that get in the way of our friendship or we would just quit being friends if the other thing just isn't an option for some reason. that's just how I'd do it though, it really depends on how your friends would respond and act towards you</p>
