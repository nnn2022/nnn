    <strong>Conspiracy Theories are real, I don't trust the government. ...Oh, except for this time. This time I totally believe covid.</strong>
    <p><p>I found myself in a conversation with a blue piller, so I decided to tackle the problem from the side.</p>
<p>I mentioned some people believe we never went to the moon.  She lit up very brightly and said, "oh yeah, we watched a documentary about that the other day!  It's very interesting isn't it?"</p>
<p>We talked about that for a while, and she said she believes it's possible we never went to the moon.  She gave many pieces of evidence for this.  I said I have no idea, but that would be quite an operation if that were true, and she agreed.</p>
<p>So then I mention 9/11.  And she immediately goes, "oh yeah, that was totally an inside job.  They used 9/11 to justify going into Iraq because of oil.  Everyone knows that!"</p>
<p>Up until this point, she's probably more of a conspiracy theorist than me.  And she seemed to really enjoy the subject.  Until this point, I'm just establishing her position, and not offering mine.  I continue to pretend I don't know.</p>
<p>She had no problem believing 9/11 was a controlled demolition, that the lunar landing were faked, and that the "2008 financial crisis" was totally overhyped in order to get free government money.  She said these things as though they were common knowledge.</p>
<p>So then I casually mention, "you know...  Covid could be one of those things..."</p>
<p>The entire room immediately stopped.  Everyone converged to our conversation.  She completely changed her demeanor.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?  Of course not!  Of course there's a deadly virus out there!"</p>
<p>"You believe people who don't even have the virus can pass on a virus they don't even have to other people who also don't know, but also the this virus is super deadly and in this way grandma dies?"</p>
<p>"You don't know if you don't have the virus."</p>
<p>"But it's a super deadly virus."</p>
<p>"But you might be asymptomatic."</p>
<p>"In which case, I have defeated the virus and I now have immunity."</p>
<p>"Yes, but you could pass it on anyway."</p>
<p>"How could I pass on a virus I don't have?"</p>
<p>"Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"</p>
<p>"Do you trust Big Pharma or the government?"</p>
<p>"No!  They are totally lying to us!  I don't trust Big Pharma at all (she gives many examples of this)."</p>
<p>"But you trust them now?"</p>
<p>"Well, what else are we going to do?"</p>
<p>It's incredible to me.  There are people out there willing to believe we didn't put a man on the moon, and that 9/11 was a controlled demolition done by the US government to themselves in order to justify going into Iraq.  </p>
<p>...Oh, but covid is totally real.  And everyone should get a vaccine.</p>
<p>It's almost as though people have completely suspended their thinking.</p></p>

        <p>My hardcore self-described "Libertarian Anarchist" friend who used to regularly bellow "All Government Must Be Destroyed"; is now Mr. "I got my vaccine!"</p>
<p>I asked him how he can reconcile this obviously embarrassing contradiction, and he said "a broken clock is right twice a day.  The government got it right this time."</p>

        <p>Not just that they believe Covid hype is real, but that they think it’s <em>preposterous</em> to even suggest there could ever be a lie or ulterior motive about it. It’s a wild, spiritual blindness. At this point I have to believe that it’s spiritual</p>

        <p>There's a reason they call it the Church of Covid. It's a cult. They worship this virus. Mask wearing and vaccinations bring a sense of identity and purpose. They lived miserable, lonely lives before. Now they have the power to prevent someone from going somewhere, from doing something, and to wear a mask. This is Nazi Germany all over again, with neighbors reporting neighbors for disobeying the rules. </p>
<p>We look at history and ask, "sure, Hitler was racist, but how did he convince a whole army and citizens to go along with him?".</p>
<p>Answer: the exact same way it's happening now.</p>

        <p>They probably wearn't exposed to the right info. It's like the people that are like "I'm not anti-vax. I get all the other ones. Just not the Covid one." I say to those people, "you would probably not be as trusting with those either if you spent as much time looking into the info as you did with the Covid vaccine ". The same authorities that allowed this to go on also pulled some strings in other areas too. In fact, it doesn't stop with vaccines either. The whole medical system is corrupt. The FDA and big pharma trade CEOs and work to make sure they have shared interests. There's no one fighting for the safety of consumers. There's only regulation agencies making sure that cheap "alternative" treatments are banned to make sure big pharma's profits are safe.</p>

        <p>Exactly. And it doesn’t stop with the medical system either. The people in this sub who try to paint themselves as credible or reasonable by claiming they don’t believe any other conspiracy theories are just as ridiculous as the people who say this is the one time the government is acting in our best interest. If you can accept that the government lied about COVID in order to manipulate the public into taking an experimental vaccine, then why is it so hard to pull up a picture of the pentagon and accept the obvious truth that it was not hit by a 747?</p>

        <p>Everyone has their line where they go full NPC. Remember how conservatives who generally don't trust the government were suddenly all in on the Iraq War? Even the Dixie Chicks got cancelled when they voiced concerns about it. Radio stations also stopped playing music by Rage Against the Machine because being against the machine was considered politically incorrect.</p>
<p>It seems like a lot of this comes down to that famous Milgram experiment and variations of it. A finding that is replicated over and over again is that more than 50% of people are just itching for an excuse to be evil. They'll do things like administer lethal shocks to people who are begging for help as long as a person in a position of authority tells them they won't be punished for it.</p>

        <p>The Iraq war had reason to support it beyond all the lies.  Read about why Christopher Hitchens supported the war. </p>
<p>We already were commiting acts of war against Iraq some gulf war 1 at that point due to our no fly zone in the north to orot CT the Kurds from sadam.  We also promised the Kurds we would liberate them after the first gulf war and owed them that.  So many died because we told them that.</p>

        <p>I am noticing that they are all putting their hand in the sand with this one as soon as they get the vaccine. Two people I know agreed with me on skepticism about the vaccine, told me they'd wait. Suddenly one day they just get the vaccine and tell me they don't want to talk about anything vaccine related when I bring it up. I guess that's just the cognitive dissonance.</p>

        <p>Yeah, my brother has always been very aware of the world, until covid came along. He now prefers lockdown because he can work from home, and always asks "why would they want to hurt us". Seems fear has got to him, doesn't question anything to do with covid or vaccines. Now I'm alone in my family in regards to how I think.</p>

        <p>? you do realize all conspiracies are in fact a compound of conspiracies. its not just X calls Y to do Z.. there are various systems involved that keep adding to the issue.<br>
plus life is complex in itself, even without intention an issue splits in multiple ones</p>

        <p>I don't like the term "conspiracy theories".  It implies the theory it isn't true, and are just the musings of "crazy" people.  The thing is, they often later end up being proven true, and then we just call them an example of corruption, or something "we all knew" anyway.</p>
<p>This entire year has been chalk full of examples.  But a good one is vaccine passports, which are now becoming a reality.  But a "conspiracy theory" at all anymore.  Why does this keep happening?</p>
