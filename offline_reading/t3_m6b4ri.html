        <p>Terrain theory, very summarized;</p>
<p>“In the 1800s, the French chemist Louis Pasteur popularized the germ theory, proposing that microorganisms are the cause of most diseases.  This paved the way for antibiotics—which kill both good and bad bacteria—and vaccines—which seek to prevent single diseases. </p>
<p>By contrast, Pasteur’s friend, physiologist Claude Bernard, taught that the ‘terrain’ of the human body was more important than the ‘pathogens’ that infect it.  We are surrounded by, and even harbor, microorganisms in our bodies.  When exposed to pathogens, we become ill if our defenses are weakened by deficiencies or toxicities.  Unlike the germ theory, the terrain theory explains why some people get sick while others, when exposed to the same pathogens, do not.  For this reason, it is said that on his death bed, Pasteur admitted, ‘Bernard was right: the pathogen is nothing, the terrain is everything.’”</p>
<p>It is possible Pasteur did not say this on his deathbed, but also not impossible.</p>
<p>Most of what we know in modern medicine is predicated on the assumption of germ theory. How this relates specifically to coronavirus is that a virus is largely misunderstood. We have done our research on how a virus works <em>assuming</em> it/germs are the cause of disease. Terrain theory, largely summarized, says that a virus is the result of disease. Not the cause.</p>
<p>A virus is the excrement of decaying cellular material. Why does a dead tree grow cultures that a live tree does not? Decaying cellular material. What we see in people with the flu is a detoxification. The body is expulsing the viral material through the mucous. This is why we test the nose for corona/influenza. Getting the flu simply means there is something else going on with your body creating dis-ease. Think, too much sugar. GMO foods. Radiation poisoning from devices/cell phone towers. Metals in the air. All these things and so many more create an acidic state in the body so it must detox. A flu is this detoxification. It is the result of disease, not the cause.</p>

        <p>Nuance, else we go off the deep end.</p>
<p>Germ theory is about as proven as gravity, whether it be through bacteria or viruses (edit: or fungus), these pathogens infecting the body are what cause disease. The unequivocal success of modern medicine (eradicated diseases, ability to cure previously incurable diseases, isolate and treat infectious diseases, etc...) Is based on germ theory, and disease behavior (infection, spread, resistance) supports it as well. Terrain theory can play a part in the body's immune system and defenses, which are obviously also important, but that doesn't mean germ theory is debunked or a hoax.</p>
<p>Take rabies as an example: it doesn't spontaneously appear across the population, but has a known means of spread, and can be treated if done so quickly; else if not, it doesn't matter how healthy or cleansed you are, you will die.</p>
<p>Viruses aren't excrement of decaying cells. They're not caused or created by sugar or GMOs or radiation poisoning. This doesn't mean a healthy immune system is unimportant, or that the COVID response was anything remotely logical or desirable.</p>

        <p>“...whether it be through bacteria or viruses, these pathogens infecting the body are what cause disease.” Okay, just show an observable, repeatable experiment yielding consistent results that demonstrated this assertion.</p>
<p>“The unequivocal success of modern medicine..” Modern medicine can’t seem to fix heart disease, obesity or cancer, so maybe adopting a new theory can change this. Maybe we are wrong..?</p>
<p>“...that doesn’t mean germ theory is debunked or a hoax.” Yes, actually. If terrain theory better describes biology and what is happening to our bodies then it absolutely debunks germ theory as the two suggest completely opposite assertions. There is no human construct of medicine more powerful than the human immune system. </p>
<p>~~Rabies is blood transmission. This is different.~~ Rabies is actually a joke.</p>
<p>“Viruses aren’t the excrement of decaying cells..” okay. Thank you for your opinion. It is my opinion that they are. Please read “The Private Science of Louis Pasteur” for evidence.</p>
<p>Convid response was illogical because viral spread is a pseudoscientific myth perpetuated by the same propaganda machine that created the plandemic.</p>

        <p>You challenged me to learn something about rabies today. thank you.</p>
<p>“According to Farmers Bulletin No. 449 of the U.S. Agricultural Department, no one can catch rabies from an animal that bites them unless the animal has the disease. Furthermore, less than 15% of those bitten by a rabid dog and not treated will generally contract the disease. This is very different from the hullaballoo generally raised by the self-styled 'regular' doctors, and especially by health officers, over every dog bite they hear of. In an official publication such as the Farmers' Bulletin, this is quite an admission; unofficial and anti-vivisection sources of information generally place the percentage much closer to zero.</p>
<p>Bulletin No. 65 of the U.S. Hygienic Laboratory at Washington also admits that those who die after treatment die earlier than untreated cases! It says:</p>
<p>"Treatment. Nitsch has pointed out that in a large series of cases the deaths in spite of the Pasteur treatment occurred on average earlier than in untreated persons (64.5 to 90 days).</p>
<p>There is some reason to believe that the rabies virus as it occurs in nature varies much in virulence, and that this is in some way related to the geographic distribution." (p.21)</p>
<p>To anyone who read Chapter 7 it will be evident that (assuming it has value), one should not use a serum from a distant location if this is true, as the possibility of 'agglutination' would be very small where there were such variations. And to this they add:</p>
<p>"Inoculation with spinal fluid obtained during life is wholly unreliable as it usually fails even in true cases of rabies." (p.36)</p>
<p>The New York Anti-Vivisection Society has published several pamphlets from which the following information is taken.</p>
<p>They state that rabies is a very rare disease except where dogs have been injected with rabies serum, in which case it very often develops.</p>
<p>According to their views, a dog unable to find green grass to eat in winter is very apt to develop worms or maggots, or both, in the intestines, often perforating them, and driving the dog frantic. In this condition the dog will bite at everything blindly, foam at the mouth, and run amuck generally, refusing water and seeking solitude.</p>
<p>Hay, grass, hide or bones fed to the dogs will cause the irritable conditions to disappear.</p>
<p>There are no real grounds for supposing that madness, as found in humans, occurs in dogs, nor can it be proved that the bite from a distracted animal can produce madness in anyone bitten. Further, so-called rabies can be shown to be the direct result of serum injections.</p>
<p>Competent authorities claim that in so-called 'real' rabies, a dog never foams at the mouth, but has a small amount of brownish stringy discharge hanging from the lips, and the eyes have a fiery glare.</p>
<p>In epilepsy, the dog trembles, his jaws champ violently and his voluntary muscles are powerfully convulsed; there is a copious discharge of white frothy saliva; he utters sharp cries and when recovering from the fit, the eyes are dull and stupid. This might be due to fright, or heat in summer.</p>
<p>They quote doctors of unquestionable authority as saying that no rabic germ has been found; and that finding so-called Negri bodies is no proof that the dog has rabies; as "they are found when all symptoms are absent and when all are present, so the diagnosis of rabies is pure guesswork", according to J.A. McLaughlin, D.V.S.</p>
<p>Even by A.M.A. standards no successful serum can be made without the right germ, so this might account for the large number of deaths that follow the Pasteur treatment.</p>
<p>Some doctors say the bite of a rabid dog is absolutely harmless to man. C. W. Dulles, M.D., a famous authority on dog diseases and hydrophobia who looked up the records in many cities, says over a million dogs and cats were handled by dog catchers in 14 years, with many thousands of bites, but no treatment - and not a single case of hydrophobia appeared in these cases.</p>
<p>He and other doctors had posted for years standing offers of $100.00 to $1,000.00 for a genuine case of dog hydrophobia and had no claimants, though thousands of dogs were being killed yearly because of scares; one place claiming that 92% of those killed in one year had hydrophobia!</p>
<p>These doctors say chaining or muzzling a dog that has always been free is apt to cause the very irritability we want to avoid.”</p>

        <p>&rt;Okay, just show an observable, repeatable experiment yielding consistent results that demonstrated this assertion.</p>
<p>Just from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease?wprov=sfla1">wikipedia page</a> on germ theory:</p>
<p>You have experiments of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agostino_Bassi?wprov=sfla1">Agostino Bassi</a> showing fungus causes a disease in caterpillars;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis?wprov=sfla1">Ignaz Semmelweis</a> showing washing hands in a solution that would kill microorganisms lowers infant mortality rate;</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow?wprov=sfla1">John Snow</a> and the cholera outbreak, showing boiling water stops the disease, and isolating a source;</p>
<p>The list goes on. If that isn't enough for you, a (highly unethical) experiment would be to take the bacteria cholera, put it in water, and then have a double blind study where some people drink the water unboiled and others drink it after being boiled. Heck, others could drink through a LifeStraw or use iodine tablets as well. And you'd find that only those drinking the untreated water were those getting sick with cholera.  </p>
<p>&rt;Modern medicine can’t seem to fix heart disease, obesity or cancer, so maybe adopting a new theory can change this. Maybe we are wrong..?</p>
<p>None of those are caused by pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungus). They all also aren't contagious. Modern medicine can cure/prevent polio, leprosy, smallpox, HPV, tetanus, chickenpox, etc...</p>
<p>&rt;Yes, actually. If terrain theory better describes biology and what is happening to our bodies then it absolutely debunks germ theory as the two suggest completely opposite assertions</p>
<p>It doesn't better describe. It can play a small part:</p>
<p>"Even when a pathogen is the principal cause of a disease, environmental and hereditary factors often influence the severity of the disease, and whether a potential host individual becomes infected when exposed to the pathogen."</p>
<p>&rt;Rabies is blood transfusion. This is different.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies_virus?wprov=sfla1">Rabies is a virus</a>. It primarily spreads through saliva, too. What do you mean it is a blood transfusion?</p>

<p>15% chance of certain death. That's why if a bitten by an unknown dog or animal it's recommended you get rabies shots - that chance is absolutely significant.</p>
<p>&rt;There is some reason to believe that the rabies virus as it occurs in nature varies much in virulence</p>
<p>Germ theory...</p>
<p>As for treatment, if given rabies vaccines before symptoms occur, almost everyone survives. Due to the nature of the virus, this isn't effective after symptoms have started.</p>
<p>Rabies kills almost <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-people-are-killed-by-rabies-in-the-us.html">60k</a> people per year, typically in rural and poor areas of India and Asia. In countries that have robust health systems and administer rabies vaccines frequently for suspect bites, like the US, only a few deaths occur per year, if that.</p>
<p>I'm confused on your point: you're accepting that rabies is caused by a virus that can spread between infected animals to people? That's germ theory.</p>

        <p>The article is intended to provide facts for speculation. You are taking sentences out of context and then using them to support germ theory. This excerpt does not support germ theory. Why are you being disingenuous?</p>
<p>“According to Farmers Bulletin No. 449 of the U.S. Agricultural Department, no one can catch rabies from an animal that bites them unless the animal has the disease. Furthermore, less than 15% of those bitten by a rabid dog and not treated will generally contract the disease. This is very different from the hullaballoo generally raised by the self-styled 'regular' doctors, and especially by health officers, over every dog bite they hear of. In an official publication such as the Farmers' Bulletin, this is quite an admission; unofficial and anti-vivisection sources of information generally place the percentage much closer to zero.</p>

        <p>Your previous comment was about disproving germ theory. I’m not confused by the low transmission rate of rabies via bite. I was confused by how the passage proved terrain theory. The passage states “no one can catch rabies from an animal that bites them unless the animal has the disease.” This is a great example of germ theory. An infected animal transmits the disease through a bite. While the 15% statistic is important, it doesn’t take away from the fact that the bite is the way the disease is spread. The passage also does not mention the severity of the bites or the spread of the disease in the host animal, both of which would play a roll in spreading the disease. 
I don’t have any research for this, but I assume that most animal bites aren’t incredibly severe, and animals don’t always bite people at the height of the infection. However, due to the severity of the disease and the lack of other treatment methods, health experts recommend getting a rabies shot after even the smallest of bites because the consequences of being in the 15% are quite severe. </p>
<p>Getting back around to the original focus, I believe that passage is a direct refutation of terrain theory. Terrain theory states that the disruption and weakening of the body caused by the bite is what gives you the disease, but if that were true, then any animal could give you rabies, but like the passage says, no one can get it from a bite unless the animal is infected. Even though the transmission rate is 15% in infected animals, it doesn’t change the fact that the rate is 0% in uninfected animals. The lack of transmission in uninfected animals is enough to disprove terrain theory.</p>

        <p>Well stated. It seems terrain theory rightly lost and was left in the past with miasma and bloodletting compared to germ theory. OP stating COVID is a hoax because germ theory isn't real just gives ammo to doomers labeling all lockdown skeptics as conspiracy theorists.</p>

        <p>That Farmers Bulletin you are citing is from 1923, which appears to be the most recent of the literature you brought up. Older sources can be insightful, but these predate lab techniques like PCR and technology like the electron microscope which has allowed our understanding of infectious disease to make considerable leaps. </p>
<p>You decided to learn about rabies, so you picked up a US Agriculture bulletin from the Roaring 20s? </p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to be critical and frustrated with the COVID pandemic, but whatever bone you have to pick with Pasteur and the cornerstones of biology does not apply.</p>

        <p>Neither have you. You're the one spewing pseudoscientific nonsense, the onus of proof is on you here.</p>
<p>If you want scientific experiments, just look at stuff like the tuskagee experiment or the multitude of fucked up stuff the Japanese did to research germ warfare. They exposed people to microbes to see their effects. Want something further back? John Snow discovering Cholera bacteria in water and discovering that boiling infected water kills the bacteria and makes the water safe to drink. People have given you studies, you being willfully blind in favour of your conspiracy theory crap is just making all of us look bad.

        <p>The Tuskegee Study, which is also known as the Tuskegee Syphilis study was an infamous, unethical, and malicious clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the US Public Health Service.</p>
<p>You are claiming a virus is contagious. This predicated on germ theory being correct. Are you able to demonstrate your claims scientifically?</p>
<p>Gravity is a theory, yes. I’m sure you’re next strategy will be to attempt to usurp my character for saying so. Please stay on topic and avoid character arguments.</p>

        <p>Just because a study was horrifically unethical doesn't mean its findings are invalid.</p>
<p>Go cough on someone if you get sick with any respiratory disease. Odds are that person will get sick too. If you do tests on you both, you'll find viral/bacterial/fungal microbes in your systems. Simple shit here bro.</p>

        <p>So you want anecdotal evidence? Ok, I have exchanged bodily fluids with a number of partners who were sick at the time and did not get sick myself. All of them were actually surprised by this.</p>
<p>Your explanation is in line with terrain theory. A sick person will detox the viral excrement through their mucous. Another person ingesting their mucous would likely warrant a positive test. Simple shit here bro.</p>

        <p>Good information, thank you. I’ll give it a listen. I very much believe this is the root of the issue. Most people are busy arguing over “how contagious” or “how deadly” when the reality is neither of these are true concerning a virus.</p>

        <p>In my opinion the problem with terrain theory vs germ theory is that the assumption is made that they are diametrically opposed. In my opinion both ideas are necessary for the understanding of disease, and even modern science based on germ theory clearly accepts concepts that are based on terrain theory. The entire notion of asymptomatic disease is something out of terrain theory, namely that certain people can be exposed to a pathogen without getting sick. We all know that, it is a terrain theory idea, but the rabid proponents of germ theory will say there is no validity to anything to do with terrain theory. The rejection of Koch's postulates is an obvious admittance that terrain theory has some validity.</p>
<p>Conversely I find it silly to claim that there is no such thing as a microorganism that causes disease when we clearly see that this does happen, given the right conditions in a host organism. Not everyone gets sick after exposure but no one has ever had a staph infection without being infected by staphylococcus bacteria.</p>

        <p>Yes, but if I recall correctly, classic Béchamp terrain theory dismisses the very idea that microorganisms have anything to do at all with disease. Or is that an incorrect notion pushed to discredit terrain theory?</p>
