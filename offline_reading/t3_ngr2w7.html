    <strong>We Will Never Return Back To Normal. Normal Living Is A Thing of The Past Now.</strong>
    <p><p>Even if we manage to eradicate this "virus" through vaccinations, we can never return to normal. Not anymore. Not with the way things are headed. Because a very dangerous stage has been set, and the one that allows those in power to enact lockdowns in a moment and to take away our rights and freedoms, all in the name of collectively combatting some "deadly" disease, that kills less than 1% of the population. Yes you doomers. The survival rate of this "deadly" disease is 99.7%. </p>
<p>And, if you don't comply or just voice your opinions, you are a monstrous, grandma killer with no regard for human life. Personally Idgaf. I walk in wherever without a mask, until I'm told to comply otherwise I don't want to get banned from every store. And I've gotten called a "killer" for simply not wearing a mask irl and of course, I bet you know by who. Fat and gay sounding pussy worshippers who think they will get all the chicks by being the "obedient slave" to the gov and by virtue signaling Me to wear a mask. Little do they know, they are a rope bunny to the government for free use and no wonder they all love it! Daddy government gets you off good huh? </p>
<p>You doomers are so obsessed in gaining pleasure that, you have fucked everyone's future and erased our past. Most of you don't have an ounce of logic and when anyone says the facts to you, what are your excuses? "We are nazi's who love killing people and don't have any empathy." Well, if y'all have that much empathy then tell master (government) to lock and tie you up forever because whenever you go out you also can kill grandma... even if your quadmasking. (Masks don't do shi, and that myth has been debunked thousands of times). </p>
<p>You people either virtue signal us or just straight up wish death upon us and our families for daring to complain. What's the theory behind double masking in the car while being alone? You are truly the slaves that anyone can wish to have. Your master fauci has an eye on you, wherever you go and that's why you obediently mask in your cars. Idk what hypnotizing submission thing your master has done on you, but it's totally working. </p>
<p>If we carry on down this path this new normal will become our reality. We will never see our friends or families again. Grandma and grandpa will eventually die from something other than COVID and you won't care. You won't have seen them in ages anyway. You'll have disassociated yourself emotionally from them. These fucking masks and lockdowns have left deep psychological scars on everyone. I can't even meet chicks or talk with someone decent anymore! With all these quad maskers, I feel like I'm a ring in the desert. All those fun days are gone. And police can even question you now where I live for simply going out. And for what? For a disease of 99.7% survival rate. </p>
<p>These face-masks aren't going away. In fact, a lot of the insane moro-ns fantasize about it. But sure, if we wear the masks (which don't work by the way) they'll go "away" eventually, keep repeating that. When will the madness end? Remember you little effing doomers, this was supposed to last 2 weeks. More than a year has past, vaccines have been given out and yet the restrictions have gotten worse. You see that you blind fucking clowns! Oh I forgot you all are still blindfolded by your master Fauci and can't see through your obedience to him. Well, wake the F up. This is never going away. It was never about a virus. It was about control all along.</p></p>

        <p>I am a woman and I cackled at "fat and gay sounding pussy worshippers" üòÇüòÇüòÇ</p>
<p>I can tell you this, the women who are going for men like this are not going to be women you would even want to be around. There is a severe shortage of normal manly men these days and I really don't give a shit how this sounds to people who are offended by it it's the truth. If we had more men like this they would have been fighting throughout this whole thing and it never would have gotten this far. They would have been defending their families and fighting for their kids, not triple masking like they have been. I understand doing it in the beginning, I think we all did. We're not that insane. There was a certain point when we didn't know what this was and we did obey. But a lot of us learned that it wasn't just about a virus at a certain point.</p>
<p>Anyway, I feel you on this. I do think that with the passage of time a lot of people are going to look back on this with embarrassment. They are going to realize this is not what they were told it was. Not saying that it wasn't something at all because it was for sure but it's not what all the fear-mongering lead people to believe.</p>
<p>I think we may be surprised with the things that will eventually come out. Think of all the times in history that people went through extremely stressful hopeless times. This is one of those times, we are living through it in real-time we're not reading about it in history books. Often times the way things are seeing initially changes dramatically as the story unfolds. This is still unfolding.</p>

        <p>Nothing but truth. When you have "men" that are like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/neeu5x/are_these_zoomer_vaxxer_mentally_ill/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">this</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/AHyiaJalPdM">this</a>, the future of this country is truly in jeopardy. And, who said they are getting any women? Fatty doomers chicks don't count LOL. The hot and submissive one's will always and only go for masculine men. This is biology and has been the case since the beginning of time and no clown world/times can change biology.</p>

        <p>Yes, I‚Äôve read pieces about how a lot of liberal women are conflicted and horrified at being attracted to trump supporters or conservatives, traditionally masculine men  but a lot of them are. It goes against what they have been told they should want in a man. You can‚Äôt deny biology though. I tried dating when I was single and I was disgusted by the men here in nyc. After attempting to deal with them I felt like my sperm count was higher than theirs. It‚Äôs no surprise a lot of them think they are saving lives staying home for a year and triple masking. I was once a typical liberal dem but I was never a blue haired sjw variety. I managed to find normal men but none were in Manhattan. Nothing grossed me out more than ‚Äúmale feminists‚Äù. They are creepy and calculating and ironically they usually hate women. I am a very independent person , I have taken care of myself for years but I am attracted to men who I know could carry us need be, a strong capable man who could defend me if he had to. Even if it never happened it‚Äôs more attractive to know a guy is capable of that.</p>

        <p>Facts. You should read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TraditionalMuslims/comments/n9lmfl/what_is_the_reality_of_whiteknigs_sims_and_male/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">this</a> post of Mine. I describe everything regarding these 'men' and what went wrong with them. Society is clown, and it will only get more clowner. Personally, yes, even the dems are submissive but I wouldn't trust them because of their views. They are unpredictable and can change in a flash.</p>
<p>In the end, finding good men/women these days is like finding a ring in the middle of the desert. It's too tough but let's see. Personally, I lost all hope in society and will do My own thing and focus on Myself.</p>

        <p>I am isolated. Have given up friends and family. Won‚Äôt speak to neighbors. I live on a blue street in a blue neighborhood in a blue city in a blue state. They all make me sick. Masked up and working from home or pensions and social security. I haven‚Äôt had an income in a year. I can‚Äôt forgive them. And I‚Äôm happier without them.  The ‚Äúscience is real‚Äù hard signs make me sick too. Smug-for-nothing fools. A family we used to go away with asked if we wanted to plan a trip now that they are vaccinated. I simply said we are financially ruined. No trips for us. I have no desire to be around people that selfish. Nature abhors a vacuum. I trust that I have made room for better people.</p>

        <p>I relate to so much what you are saying, I‚Äôve lost nearly all my friends there are a very small handful of people I know I could still count on. And I totally agree about what you said, you have made room for new people. You will find others who are in a similar position to you. I think a lot of us here have gone through a similar shake up. I to live in a very blue place and had blue friends. I don‚Äôt see them the same way anymore. I am hopeful that I will find new friends though!</p>

        <p>Hm, if i got it right and the covid vaccines are working woth transgene delivery and are thus gene therapy, (see source) </p>
<p>then these gene therapies basically set up a platform in your body which facilitates docking of future gene therapies, be it against cancer, viruses and whatnot.
If real and effective then that is quite wonderful futurism.</p>
<p>But since it is an experiment and basically genetically modifying humans that is not wonderful at all. And could ultimately get even more dystopian (source 2)</p>
<p>1.
"Increasingly, nanoparticles have been used in biomedicine as powerful tools for transgene and drug delivery, imaging, diagnostics, and therapeutics. The most successful example is the recent development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines at warp speed to combat the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which brought nanoparticles to the center stage of biomedicine and demonstrated the efficient nanoparticle-mediated transgene delivery into human body."

        <p>Might I add that not only the survival rate is 99.7%, but only approximately 2% of the entire world has even been infected with Covid.</p>
