        <p>Yes it’s incredibly worrisome.  Especially with all the evidence coming out of Vaxx shedding making the non vaccinated infertile and sick.  Here’s lots of info on the subject of the “vaxx”</p>
<p>Something to consider for everyone avoiding the vaccine</p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly apparent that the spike protein itself is toxic, not only does it have potential for prion disease, but also general neurotoxicity: </p>

<p>If you haven't been vaccinated but spend any time around those that have, you will be exposed to high amounts of this spike protein. It is not a coincidence that many women spending time around vaccinated women are also having period issues. </p>
<p>It is also not a coincidence that many people are becoming ill and developing covid symptoms after being vaccinated because what so many fail to realize is that <strong>many of the symptoms of covid are not due to the virus in it's totality, but due to the spike protein itself. Therefore, it would follow that reprogramming all cells in the body to generate this spike protein continually would lead to higher rates of disease, not just for those vaccinated, but to those spending time around them as well.</strong> </p>
<p>I speak from personal experience, my girlfriend that I live with got her first moderna shot a few weeks ago. Despite working in retail since last september, she never got symptomatic covid until after she got her shot. She got a full body rash 7 days from the shot, and 3 days after that was "the sickest i've been in 7 years". A few days after the worst of her sickness (high fever and cough) she developed a major rash at the injection site that wasn't there previously. </p>
<p>I never get sick, never get the flu, and never have worse than a cough or sore throat. But since she got vaccinated and then developed all the symptoms of covid, I have had a fever myself the past few days that won't seem to break. </p>
<p>I know I've had covid before because I was slightly ill and feeling down with a cough and sore throat last fall. </p>
<p>I think one of the biggest lies is that covid immunity wanes. <strong>It doesn't, but if the spike protein itself is being continually manufactured and attacking the body of the vaccinated person and the people living with/around them, we will see increases in "covid" as a result of this.</strong></p>
<p>It seems quite an ironic twist of fate. The doomers treat all of us that just want life to continue as it was before as walking biological bombs, just for they themselves to get "vaccinated" and become walking biological bombs themselves!</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear that news. I hope your family are ok. There will always be some deaths due to covid, like there are due to flu. That doesn’t mean putting every citizen under arrest, muzzling them, shutting down their livelihoods, and injecting emergency vaccines into people who aren’t at risk is the right thing to do. Not for a virus with such a low lethality. </p>
<p>Practice good hygiene, avoid people if you are unwell.</p>

        <p>Im truly sorry for your loss, nobody should have to lose their sister or daughter for any reason.  An estimated 650,000 people die every year from the regular flu.  The social distancing measures, the stay at home orders, the masks, all of these measures have been proven time and time again to do very little in stopping the spread of a virus.  A recent study showed that Lockdowns are actually literally 285 times worse than their benefits.</p>
<p>On the flip side,  here is a lot of proof that the vaccines are going to kill a lot of people</p>

        <p>This isn’t propaganda.  This is real doctors and real scientists who are waving the red flag on experimental  gene therapies being shamelessly pushed on unsuspecting people.  I’m truly sorry your sister died, but these “vaccines” wouldn’t have helped her, and they won’t hell anybody else.  They’re just going to kill more people.</p>

        <p>This isn’t misinformation.  What companies like Pfizer and Moderna and big pharma giants are telling you when they are making BILLIONS of dollars off of vaccine sales is misinformation.  mRNA technology failed at animal testing every time before it got emergency clearance and they conveniently skipped animal testing because ALL THE ANIMALS DIED.  All of them.  They died from blood clots and seizures and strokes and heart malfunctions, there are hundreds of doctors out there who are saying that this technology leaves a gaping hole in your immune system that essentially leaves you open to be killed from everything EXCEPT the very first strain of Covid that they used to base the vaccine off of.  It’s a tool for genocide.  Please read at least a couple of the articles I sent you, this is the opposite of propaganda and the opposite of misinformation.</p>

        <p>where is the proof on that? can you verify that these doctors are actually doctors or scientists? did you see their degree or something? Do you have written proof that animal testing was skipped? if that was the case they would not have approved the vaccines. </p>
<p>Also, I got my vaccine a few days ago. I had a light fever and headache and my arm hurts, I get the same reaction from the flu shot. Everybody reacts different to this. The vaccine or the virus...and are you really claiming that over 3million covid related deaths are worth not taking the vaccine? The deaths due to blood cloths or severe reactions are sad and shouldn’t happen but the benefits still outweigh the risks. </p>
<p>Maybe you should stop doing your “research” on facebook or youtube</p>
<p>You guys have no idea how easy it is nowadays to make a website that looks super legit and tells you absolute crap and spreads misinformation. That is why we call you idiots and morons. That is why you are the conspiracy theorists. </p>
<p>You ignore science that has been around and evolving for hundreds of years for what?! Because “big pharma” ...I stand by what I said before: Fuck you all</p>

        <p>I sent you about 10-15 links that are not from Facebook or YouTube.  Yes you can prove that these people are doctors.  You can also prove that these vaccines are already taking their toll on tonnes of people if you look at VAERS from the USA or the Uk.  You can also prove that places like the World Health Organization and GAVI revive large amounts of funding from companies like Pfizer and Moderna and Astra-Zeneca.  </p>
<p>To say that large companies would not have approved these products if they knew they were toxic, Rome has proven over and over that making a profit comes before public health.</p>
<p>It’s been proven time and time again also that the death numbers for Covid have been inflated like crazy.  The PCR test is completely flawed and has as much as a 90% false positive rate.  I’m not going to sit here and argue this with you, but you’re being lied too.  Covid is a complete sham, the vaccine is going to kill many many many people, and big companies and corporations that make billions of dollars off of people being sick do not have public health in their minds.</p>

        <p>You people just don’t care about anyone other than yourself. so you come up with these “doctors” and your manufactured proof of shit. </p>
<p>Me, my partner and most of my friends are not at risk to die from covid but we are still taking the vaccine and comply with mask wearing...Why? Because even if you have mild or maybe no symptoms at all you can still spread it and infect people that are at risk, like our parents, our grandparents, our coworkers and people living in our community that can’t get any vaccines. </p>
<p>So yes, I am willing to take this risk of having sideeffects from a vaccine to help keep my friends, my family, my coworkers and my community safe. You are all just selfish morons that believe in every crap that gets spread around the internet. </p>
<p>I checked some of your links and out of the 5 i clicked I got 3 virus warnings on my computer and the source of 2 of them is from Russia...wanna explain that?!</p>

        <p>I don’t know if you’ve missed this, but from the amount of mainstream nonsense you’ve swallowed it doesn’t surprise me.  There were actually LESS DEATHS overall worldwide in 2020 than in 2019.  Not a single medical system has ever actually been overwhelmed since the start of this nightmare.  Covid-19, the virus, has YET TO BE PROVEN TO CONCLUSIVELY EXIST.  There is no DNA sequencing of the virus, nobody can produce one.  Simultaneously, the regular flu has magically disappeared?? To be replaced by a virus that is completely indiscernible from the flu? Come on.  </p>
<p>You people say that people like me don’t care about other people,  well you’re right.  I don’t give a fuck about you, or your grandparents, or your friends.  I don’t even know you! You people virtue signalling and pretending you’re some sort of paragon of shining human kindness and caring is all bullshit! You don’t give a fuck about me, you don’t care about my friends or my parents or my grandparents,  you don’t know me or them or anyone, how the fuck could you? People like You wish death and worse upon those of us who have the balls to stand up and say that something is not right with the world yet You expect us to change our entire way of life, destroy small business, destroy the arts, abolish human connection of all kinds, pollute the earth with masks, and be forced to take experimental drugs that have an ABUNDANCE of evidence that points towards them being more dangerous than the actual virus, and then you have the audacity to call us the selfish ones??  </p>
<p>You and all of your friends have clearly gone completely insane.  So much so you think that scientific evidence out of Russia invalidates it somehow? Are their scientists not up to your standards? What makes the news you listen to trustable? Pfizer has paid out something like over 4 BILLION dollars in medical lawsuits for criminal mal-practise.  J&amp;J has knowingly put cancerous materials in their baby products. Astra-Zeneca is literally just the modern day incarnation of British Chemical who worked on atomic bombs in world war 2.  Who the fuck in their right mind thinks that “vaccines” they are making, which by the way, shouldn’t even be called vaccines because they are technically experimental gene therapies not vaccines, are safe?? </p>
<p>There are people who have died from bleeding out of their eyes from the Pfizer.  Doctors in their 30s and 40s are dying from this shots.  People have had all of their skin peel off.  Paralysis happens too, strokes, not to mention the “not so rare” rare blood clotting disorder that seems to be popping up more and more.  By March 19th, 44000 reports had been reported to the British VAERS system and they expect that less than 1% of adverse reactions get reported.  Whatever news source is feeding you that it’s a “small risk of side effects” is lying to your face and you’re eating it up.  Take a look at the testimonies here and tell these people that the vaxx they took was safe.  </p>

<p>I’m not sure wether you’re purposefully ignorant or wether you’re just missing that fact that our world and our society is being played for chumps with this pandemic but we really need you to open your eyes and realize that things are not as they seem.  You’re being lied to by people in power who want nothing more than for you to be dead.  You’re spending your energy fighting against me, someone is trying desperately to retain SOME of our Hunan rights and freedoms when you should be aiming at the criminals who have destroyed society and caused the single greatest transfer of wealth from the lower to the upper class in the history of the world.  Think about that, and then maybe you’ll realize what’s truly going on.   I promise you it’s not about a virus.</p>
