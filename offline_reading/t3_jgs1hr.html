    <strong>Anyone else noticing how many new serieses are about viruses/diseases?</strong>
    <p><p>Now I'm not a conspiracy theorist who believes there's an agenda in the media to normalise diseases/mask wearing, but it's just something annoying that I've noticed lately.</p>
<p>First there was the Spanish series High Seas (Alta Mar). Their final season came out this summer, pretty bad and nonsensical because it looked like it had been cancelled and they tried to finish everything abrubtly into two episodes. It was trying to cash in on coronavirus by having (you guessed it), a virus as the main plot.</p>
<p>Then I was trying to look for something else to watch, and I started watching La Revolution. Number 1 in my country. And I should have learned not to trust my country after Freud made it to the top of the list in April. It's about, you guessed it, a virus. I really question its historical accuracy considering that they know about 'viruses' and 'epidemics' in 17th century France. They also really didn't need to focus on the virus aspect and could have used that time ore efficiently.</p>
<p>What other shows have you noticed are trying to pull in people with stories about viruses/diseases? If they continue, at this rate truly nothing will be original.</p></p>

        <p>Netflix released a documentary called ‘Pandemic’ in January about the Spanish flu. Looking back it feels quite planned.</p>
