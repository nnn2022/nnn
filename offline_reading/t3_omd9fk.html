    <strong>My two cents.</strong>
    <p><p>This will probably get taken down quickly but if atleast one person here reads this and thinks about it, my mission is accomplished. I’m not here to troll. Since this is an “inclusive” community, I would like to state my two cents. Take it or leave it- it’s upto you. </p>
<p>If someone was out there with a magical power to shoot bullets with their mouth at random people and was using that power to kill anyone he chooses to, will his “freedom” to do so be encouraged? Now replace bullets with the virus. </p>
<p>I’m not going to dox myself with the details but there was a well publicized story during the start of COVID (before masks were required) that caught my attention. A healthy bus driver in my town was coughed on by someone boarding the bus. He complained about the incident on social media. He was sweating and looked visibly sick in that video. Days later, he died of COVID. Neither him nor the passenger who coughed were wearing masks. In essence, he was murdered by the passenger. This is when l decided to take COVID seriously. If they had simply worn masks in a proper manner, the odds of him dying would have been longer. I don’t want to unintentionally murder someone.</p>
<p>Vaccines are crucial to stop variants. I don’t want to be the one responsible for someone getting a future variant. Because I don’t want to murder anyone . That’s not my “freedom”</p>
<p>Please think about how your actions and misinformation affects others and those close to you. Good day folks</p></p>

        <p>lol “bullets from your mouth”</p>
<p>IF covid were that lethal, it means more than just the bus driver would’ve died from it. It means everyone else that “infected rider” was in contact with died, then everyone they were in contact with died and so on till we would’ve had a significant portion of humans dead.</p>
<p>But no. Covid 19 is a weak one hence the 97-99% recovery.  People can have it and have no idea/symptoms. </p>
<p>you are actually the misinformation you accuse others of being.  It’s ok. Big Pharma will save you.</p>
<p>Look at how world renowned the US medical/pharmaceutical/insurance system is.</p>

        <p>You believed some fear mongering story at the beginning of the “pandemic” that made you go oh my god this virus is real and is insanely deadly. Now imagine seeing those types of stories everyday.. cnn,nbc,the hill, yahoo, npr, nyt. These were all the companies that reported on that story you’re talking about with the bus driver. They are mainstream news that work in sync with each other and with globalist elitists and bureaucrats to push an agenda.  You have been brainwashed and deceived by news that pretends to be objective when they have a clear narrative being pushed.  Get the vaccine and fuck off because if you’re vaccinated you don’t have anything to worry about, right? </p>
<p>Deaths will go up soon and it won’t be because of the delta variant it will be the people that got the “vaccine” dying. The news won’t report that they will simply say it’s the unvaccinated creating more variants and spreading them. Thus creating more pressure on the unvaccinated to get the shot. It’s coming</p>

        <p>Fallacy after fallacy after fallacy.</p>
<p>You can't shoot bullets out of your mouth, nor out of your ass.</p>
<p>Try again with something credible. Your example is BS, and your question has been responded to in one flavor or another in this sub more than once.</p>
<p>BTW. I thought your post got banned (see my earlier comment). As you expected, and probably hopped. It won't.</p>
<p>This playground won't just cut you off. We'll let you play, but we expect you to be able to keep up with the rest of us.</p>
<p>And if you think COVID is "Mouth Bullets" we also expect you to go home and hide under your bed, or prove it.</p>
<p>I'm tired of this goofy crap.</p>

        <p>Youre equating disease with a 99% survival rate to 'magic bullets' that kill on contact.</p>
<p>Good luck with that</p>

        <p>Died "days later" after exposure to covid?  That seems like a very short window from exposure to death.</p>
<p>Anyways, if the person coughing did it on purpose, that's a different scenario than an incidental cough.  Why wasn't there a plastic barrier between driver and passenger to begin with though?</p>
<p>If the cough was intentional, the most extreme crime could be manslaughter I'd imagine.  But people have been coughing and getting each other sick throughout all of humanity.  If it made sense to criminalize the spread of disease, it would have been done by the majority of the world already.</p>
<p>It doesn't though, getting sick is an unfortunate reality of the human experience.  People have tried this before and history has not looked at it kindly yet here we are again.</p>

        <p>How come nobody else died on the bus? How many people died after coming in contact with the bus driver? How come I don't know anyone personally that has died of Covid after 18 months but have lost 3 people so far to the vaccine. If Covid is novel, how come there are 73 patents claiming its origins and genetic sequence?</p>
