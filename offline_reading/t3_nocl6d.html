    <strong>Swine Flu</strong>
    <p><p>It happend right to my 14th Birthday. Never actually took it seriously, back in 2009-2010.</p>
<p>My Teacher told me everytime to cough on the Ellbow &amp; to wash my Hands, whenever i clean my Nose. Yes he was Paranoid about it.</p>
<p>It was also the Year, that everyone took a Roland Emmerich Movie more seriously then the Swine-Flu Pandemic.</p>
<p>I was outside with Friends &amp; sometimes alone. Vent to stores without masks, schools without masks. The Sick Pigs where deported from Farms, don’t know where.
People still ate pork.</p>
<p>Some Paranoid people volunteer weared masks &amp; there wasn’t mandatory. They thougt that the world is going to end in 2012. some people panic buyed Canned goods &amp; stored in Bunkers.</p>
<p>Vaccines against the Swine-Flu exists &amp; still today i didn’t get vaccinated from it. Because i recover from the Flu without anything.</p>
<p>Even for the Vaccines against the Swine Flu, they have rushed it. Some volunteered for to get vaccinated. But only few people..</p>
<p>After that, there where no broadcasts about the Swine Flu. It disapeared like dust.</p>
<p>Can anyone share the Story, how you saw the Swine-Flu? In 2009-2010 &amp; what is diffrent from this Virus, what is less lethal then the common cold?</p>
<p>What did make People today act like this is a Zombie-Apocalypse??
Is this because of many Post-Apocalyptic Series &amp; Movies in the 2010s?</p></p>

        <p>Swine flu came out when The Right Team was in the white house, and right in the beginning of their term. It could have been as deadly as they pretend covid is, and the media would have downplayed it.</p>

        <p>People were mentally stronger then (physically also as the virus is best suited to harm the fat and obese weak). Weak times make for weak men. The time was right for this lockdown and manipulation of the weak to happen.  The masses do not make their own decisions because they are so afraid, they like to be told what to do. MSM exploits this fact and tells them what to do. Here we are.</p>
