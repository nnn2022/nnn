    <strong>My employer asked all workers if they are vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>Some time ago, I already mentioned that the company I work for offered every employee to get vaccinated. <br>
Next day, it became public that in another plant owned by the same company, at least 60 workers were vaccinated with the same syringes and needles.</p>
<p>Until a week ago, I worked in this company (I didnt leave because of this, I always just wanted to work there for a month in the summer holiday) and on one of my last days there, the supervisor came with a name list and asked me and everyone else at my workplace if they were vaccinated. He told me that the company wants to know who is vaccinated and who isnt.</p>
<p>I proudly told him I am not, and he answered "very little people here are". When he asked another worker, he got really angry and told him that was none of his business. </p>
<p>Ironically, the social democratic party, which claims to support the working class, is probably the worst party regarding mandatory vaccines, lockdowns, masks and other crap - even more radical than our government.</p></p>
