    <strong>How do we know that pro-mask online mobs are even real?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm reposting a comment I made in another post that I think warrants discussion. What if we're all afraid of something that doesn't even actually exist?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><em>This whole hysteria is based around 99% of the population being scared shitless of the 1% of people who are woke lunatics. Virtually NO ONE actually believes in this woke shit.</em></p>
<p><em>Everyone is complying because they're scared of a mob that doesn't exist. Think about it. How do we even know these online mobs are even Americans?</em></p>
<p><em>China could have millions of people employed pretending to be Americans online and pretending to be part of these pro-muzzle and anti-white-people mobs. And companies, governments, and individuals are running around with our tails between our legs over it.</em></p>
<p><em>NO MORE.</em></p>
<p><em>We're all scared of something that doesn't exist. Take off the cuck strap. No one will say anything, and even if they do most bystanders will agree with you, not the diaper fanatic. The people who want you to strap a piece of bacteria-infested cloth to your face are the insane ones.</em></p>
<p>---</p>
<p>What if the people you know in real life and on your social media just got swept up in something that's a complete fabrication? What if we're the majority and the pro-muzzlers are less than 1% of the population? </p>
<p>It's crazy to think about and I think it might be true. China hates us and they can't directly attack us. If you wanted to destroy America, how would you do it? Exactly like this. Wannabe Instagram influencers can buy thousands of fake followers for a few bucks to make themselves popular. Why wouldn't a government spend the same amount to make their ideas popular?</p></p>

        <p>Yeah those areas are completely insane, for sure.</p>
<p>But even here in Las Vegas most people just seem like docile sheep. They just look at me with those creepy-ass beady eyes over their masks with shock but don't say anything. The only types who seem to get in my face about muzzle-wearing are early 20's girls.</p>
<p>That early 20's girl demographic is responsible for almost all of the weird social movements in history. Prohibition, Weather Underground, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, that weird shit where they put flowers on men in civilian uniforms during WWI. Even Winston was afraid of the girls in 1984 because of how fanatical they were.</p>

        <p>The way they've weaponized language is so disturbing. They make us seem like the evil ones.</p>
<p>But they're the ones who bend the knee to China. They're the ones who are forcing old people to die alone due to social isolation. They're the ones shutting down small businesses.</p>
<p>How does it make sense that a small piece of fabric will prevent your body from spreading the virus? Why didn't sick people in hospitals wear masks before the pandemic?</p>

        <p>I guess it depends on where you are in Vancouver, I'm in a suburb where people truly think each other are radioactive.  I've been yelled at for standing too close to a park gate, because "WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE 6 FEET APART".  Like lady, if your uncomfortable walking past me then just ask me to move.

        <p>This is definitely not true in the Bay Area. I've been confronted twice for not wearing a mask outside not within 6 feet of anyone else. Haven't seen a single person not wearing a mask inside stores since April. 90% now where them outside, whole families including little kids masked up riding bikes, joggers wearing masks, while taking out the trash, etc. The mask hysteria has only gotten worse here, yet the people still believe "the virus would be over if only everyone wore masks".</p>

        <p>That's what I've been thinking lately. The behavior I see online is nothing like what I deal with IRL. No one at the store is hysterical and shoving their phone in my face because I walk around without a mask. I sold a couple things on Craigslist last month, both buyers had masks but said nothing about my lack of mask (transactions were made in public).</p>
<p>People are on edge and are afraid of being called out on not wearing one based on some isolated stories and online bots. The stores getting swept up in the hysteria is just the icing on the cake.</p>

        <p>Yep and it's starting to become real as people reenact the behavior they see online.</p>
<p>This was by design.</p>
<p>They shut down restaurants, bars, and churches. The places where people could talk. Now we all stare at screens reading comments from bots and start thinking it's reality. If you're completely insane and susceptible to social pressure you might think it's real and start acting like that in real life.</p>

        <p>2016 was a big eyeopener into the powerful elements that spread misinformation and propaganda online. ShareBlue and Correct The Record were the names back then. It seems like silicone valley is compromised beyond hell and have gotten away from their ideal of a free and open internet. It has interesting seeing Reddit and other websites change as the money has poured into controlling discourse.</p>

        <p>I think a LOT of the online stuff are bots or 50 Cent Army, waging a war on us.  They're tearing us apart from the inside.  Some are just real live pussies, and others are little kids that don't know any better.  I know I thought some stupid shit when I was a kid and hadn't experienced life yet... but mostly, I think it's 50 Cent Army.</p>
<p>Then you have the occasional useful idiot/raging nutcase like the soyboy with the crusty beard and neck tat that tries to shame people in pubic because they think the masses online are real and he has tons of real live support (and then finds out he doesn't).</p>
<p>I think it also depends on where you live.  Red areas on the US? We're mostly very 'fuck it' and not complying with much of anything.  Blue suburbs?  That's where the soyboys and pussies are - too weak  and prissy to live in the real city or the rural areas, and more likely be spending a lot of time on Reddit, while the rest of us got shit to be doing.</p>

        <p>Yep I've noticed that the programming is most effective on early 20's and younger.</p>
<p>They actually, <em>genuinely,</em> believe that all white people are racists and that we were running around lynching black people ten years ago. They <em>actually don't know</em> that there was literally zero racism until the left brought it back.</p>
<p>The same thing applies with the masks and lockdowns. An entire generation has been indoctrinated and none of us know what to do about it.</p>
