    <strong>Everyone seems to be on edge / on the defensive.</strong>
    <p><p>Anyone else notice this? I can recall posts in here from many months ago saying how shopping to them is now dreadful. A very palpable energy in there air that is unpleasant. A collective sense of dread and negativity.</p>
<p>I suppose this varies state by state. Being in PA, actually - EASTERN PA, we are apparently know for being pissed off all of the time. Rude, really and not in any charming way.  </p>
<p>Have you noticed this?</p></p>

        <p>This is to be expected. People are tired of the bullshit. On the other side they have turned into little uneducated tyrants. Then there are people in the middle. Things build up and after a while explode.</p>

        <p>The people "in the middle" tend to be the sorts that many describe their parents to be. They'll wear a mask and get the jab because, "hey, everyone else is doing it, might as well". Dudes in lab coats could break their front door down, and demand they get on their knees, and they'll do it without questioning it or knowing why.</p>

        <p>I am in New York City and it's been this way since the beginning here. I am constantly on alert looking around me worried about being assaulted because I don't wear a mask outside. It's honestly like being in an episode of Oz with all the different groups and their subsets of neurosis. Now we are at the point where vaccinated people are still wearing their masks because they don't want anyone to think they are a republican Trump supporter. I've never seen such a vast array of mental illness in my life. And I worked in mental health at one point so that's saying a lot.</p>

        <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>The people here who say everything is back to normal clearly don't go outside much.</p>
