        <p>Let me guess.</p>
<p>All these businesses will comply, and wait until the 4th to re-open. Oops. Wait. Wolf will then extend these orders into late January, then mid February, then March, and so on, right?</p>

        <p>You forgot the in between step where the government makes crazy requirements to reopen, all the businesses spend tens of thousands or more to comply, then they get told they can't re-open. Rinse and repeat until only giant companies are left.</p>

        <p>Yeap! I love how he thinks a two weeks shutdown will help when none of this garbage worked before. My theory is because everyone bashed him for getting COVID on his IG that this is our punishment.</p>

        <p>No, I doubt it.</p>
<p>I think this was all pre-planned. Note how the governors of the northeast have been acting in lockstep. Even the west coast governors have been a step ahead or behind with the current shutdowns and mandates.</p>

        <p>You're definitely right. It's really hard to believe we are coming up on a year of this. My daughter turned two the first week of March and the last sense of normalcy we had was going to the aquarium, mask free. The rules are becoming a burden to heavy to carry these days.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry, man. It sucks, and trust me, I feel that burden too. It's been really rough this year...and I am afraid matters might get worse.</p>
<p>They're already gunning to eradicate Christmas, something that I'm sure is being done by design. Cancelling Christmas, including activities like shopping, gatherings, public activities (if there's any left now), and so on will succeed in demoralizing the populace; and further weaken peoples' mental health.</p>

        <p>Yeap. No one cares about mental health these days. No one wants to hear how these lockdowns are pushing people over the edge and into their graves. It's all about staying home while uh...Amazon Prime comes to our doors. I wonder why those people aren't staying home. /s</p>

        <p>Sad shit man. I was going to propose to my (now-spouse) partner. We were going to honeymoon in Japan, Bali and Cape Town. Never happened. Instead we got married by Zoom in our living room. No wedding. No celebrations. I know it's not that bad compared to how many are suffering due to lost jobs, etc. but damn it sucks.</p>

        <p>It's definitely valid to be disappointed by this, whatever the reason may be. I feel like so many of us had hopes and dreams for the near future and this neverending avalanche of crap happened. My gram died a few weeks ago and they were trying to say we couldn't come in to visit her in hospice. They ended up changing their minds (in Pennsylvania) and we got a chance to visit. It's insane to think I have screenshots of my family talking to my dying gram who had absolutely no clue what the hell was going on in my phone. The hospice room she had was terrible, like a closet. All of that was because of COVID as well, whatever the hell that meant. I guess end of life care means you get shoved into a closet and thats it.</p>

        <p>That was the beginning of my anger with all of this, especially seeing dictator Wolf fist bumping with people at protests. I love how he said we can't have outside gatherings of more than 50 people, but that was okay. Sorry sir, but that's not how a pandemic works. You don't pick and choose what is safe and whats not when it suits your desires. The funeral we had was called graveside services. I was expecting something much worse but it was okay actually. We had about six chairs (not six feet apart lol) in front of the casket for family. We had probably about 50 people just scattered outside of that immediate area. The rules make no sense and I feel like I'm amongst sane people when I come to this sub.</p>

        <p>The gaslighting people do these days is insane. I try to leave a crumb trail that leads people to at least question this. I tried posting about how this pandemic affects people worldwide. Gaslighting ensued. More suicides in the month of October alone than the whole year in Japan? Oh, no worries! They always had a high suicide rate anyways! An Indian woman's baby dying from starvation because they couldn't get government food rations? Mehhhh they are already in so much poverty! Someone actually responded to my story and said these two things. I couldn't believe it. Through this pandemic so many have lost their humanity. Its okay others suffer and starve as long as its not them.</p>
