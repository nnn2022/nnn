    <strong>A Parable: The Control Room</strong>
    <p><p>Buried deep under the tallest mountain in every free society is the Control Room. It is reached by an elevator descent of almost 1km and has a sign on its steel-barred door reading "Warning: Control Room Only to Be Opened in Time of War."</p>
<p>Inside the room, if one were able to enter in time of war, are the levers, dials and buttons that have the power to stop and start the functions of a free society - the emergency powers. By pulling one lever, the heartbeat of society can be slowed or even stopped, and, it is hoped, started again afterward. By turning one dial, the lifeblood of the economy can be stilled in the veins, free citizens can be locked in their homes and even prohibited from moving freely within their own country. Businesses can be ordered shut or their production confiscated by the government for the war effort, or price controls imposed.</p>
<p>In peacetime the Control Room is safely locked away and the instruments inside are covered in a thick layer of dust, and most people forget they even exist. But in time of war, when the very existence of the nation is threatened by an external enemy, society after grave deliberation unlocks the Control Room, draws the bolts and allows the government to enter for a limited period only, to manipulate the emergency powers and, while inevitably doing damage to society through the immense and indiscriminate effects of those powers, do what needs to be done to prevent the country from being destroyed and occupied by a foreign power. As soon as the war is over, the government is immediately ushered out and the door is again locked, and the rights of the people again return to normal.</p>
<p>But now, in a time of peace, the government has been brought into the Control Room and been given a vague and indefinite mandate: save lives and suppress a respiratory virus. The existence of the nation is not threatened, and there is no time limit or condition for the end of the "emergency." The government, desperate to avoid blame for not preventing enough preventable deaths, begins pulling levers and pushing buttons, choking off the vital functions of society, throwing millions out of work and twisting what used to be a free society into the forms of a stifling medical dictatorship. </p>
<p>When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and when the government has the levers of the emergency powers under its hands, it will pull, push and turn them with increasing desperation as it becomes less and less clear that the actions of the government have any control at all over the course of outbreaks, though each pull of the lever ruins thousands of lives of innocent and healthy citizens.</p>
<p>The solution is not for the members of society to argue with each other over which lever to pull, which city to put under house arrest, which business sector to destroy. The solution is to drag the government out of the Control Room, where it never should have been allowed entry in time of peace when the existence of the nation is not under threat. Get the government out of the Control Room, lock the door, and restore stability, predictability and human rights to society. If there is work to be done in protecting the vulnerable from the virus, let it be done on the surface, in the full light of day, and with the voluntary consent of those who will be impacted. </p>
<p>Let the emergency powers alone and let them await the true existential threat for which they were designed and by which alone they can be justified.</p></p>
