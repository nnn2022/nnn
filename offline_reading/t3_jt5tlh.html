        <p>MAKE EARTH GREAT AGAIN!</p>
<p>The socialist/fascists got caught with their pants down... Court rulings coming in are devastating for the demsheviks, WI, MI, PA and GA will all go to Trump, it's fairly obvious right now.</p>
<p>I think it's happening... Republicans won huge in PA today, MI is coming with full audits and recount, GA full audit and recount, WI caught massive fraud. Way too many good news coming our way since beginning of week, this is gonna be studied until the end of civilization... The biggest fraud on democracy that ever got caught!</p>
<p>The foot soldiers of the socialist party aren't bright at all... You must have a low IQ to vote for fascism and lockdowns, but the cheaters on the ground are a different kind of stupid, no wonder some of these retards vote socialism. It was the dumb and dumber, even the fucking machine counting votes got caught with it's pants down!!! The same machines also used everywhere in Canada and Europe... Wonder why all the deep state puppets seem to get re-elected?</p>
<p>Capitalism and Democracy will prevail in the North America, there's an intense push back against fascism/socialism, like something lit a fire under our asses and it's war vs the new normal and the great reset.</p>

But the Dems were careless, they were overly confident. 
I hope and keep my fingers crossed that this will be as wrapped up as Watergate.</p>

        <p>It's fairly obvious the Republicans won... I have been following this obsessively, the propaganda networks aren't reporting this but follow real journalists and Republicans, even Rudy is coming out with good stuff.</p>
<p>It's over, the massive fraud has been uncovered, audits and recounts coming in... From fake ballots to dead voters, to mass difference between senators and presidential candidates votes in swing state, the machines counting exposed hardcore yesterday and today. The socialist deep state in Geneva got exposed hard, they really needed to control the US in order to submit earth to the great reset agenda, they went far and beyond what was originally thought, and decided they had to risk exposure in this fraud cause it was that big, they went for broke...</p>
<p>Do I think their plan was to bring in truck loads of fake ballots at 4 AM in few different swing states? No, it was to use the rigged machines only, they had to bring in millions of fake votes cause Republicans got that many vote and it caught them off guard. By doing so, they fucked up and exposed themselves...</p>
<p>Propaganda networks aren't reporting on the updates cause it's not their job too, it doesn't fit the narrative they want, the agenda they want, so they ignore it... One by one those states will all favour Trump, he clearly won the election. The courts upheld the constitution even if the socialist governors are fighting tooth and nail to stop audits and recounts.</p>
<p>I'm 95 % sure Republicans and Trump will win this election... The court rulings have all held the constitution, big victories this week for Trump, everything is crashing down in the land of the fascists/socialist.</p>

        <p>The Deep State is up against some kind of hard, make-or-break deadline, it would seem.   Very short-term tactics.  Less concern than usual for fallout.   Get 'er done and damn the consequences.  Gotta wonder what's on their radar.</p>

        <p>Just my theory, but maybe it's more people waking up to the hoax of the fearmongering from covid.  Some states are doubling down on lockdowns and people are tired of it.  Scientists are coming forward, PCR false-positives, the way too much cycle threshold to give us positives, all of it is making people question.  Without the fear they can't control us as well and the great reset (or whatever they are trying to pull over) won't go off as easy.  Anyone else wonder why the cases are exploding and they are pushing testing down our throats?  Yeah, it's out there, I admit, but this amount?  Maybe these cases going up this amount with the new vaccine coming out will push more people to rush for it (when fear will rule instead of intellect).  </p>
<p>I dunno, just thoughts floating around my head.  But something sure does stink.</p>

        <p>I voted for him solely for his lockdown position, but unless he gets rid of Barr and Pompeo I'm not convinced he's fighting the deep state. He's been hyping the vaccine too. Not trying to be an asshole, just make sure you keep your eye on him too.</p>

        <p>Not sure on Barr, I don't think he's with the eugenics in Geneva but it's clear he ain't with Trump. Mitch had to give him a talk before he hoped on board to go after the demsheviks. Which might indicate he's a never Trumper but still for capitalism and democracy, still makes him Aces in my books...</p>
<p>Pompeo is clearly for capitalism and democracy, definitely isn't with the socialists in Geneva... He's American deep state, the military complex and the CIA, the amount of weapons the Trump admin has sold in the 4 years he's been in, is in the hundreds of billions. I'll take an American Imperialist crook any day over the demented fucks in Geneva who want the enact the great reset/depopulation agenda.</p>

        <p>Trump's got an uphill battle to flip 3 states, but he does have a real shot. The election certainly should not be called at this point with all the recounts and lawsuits. Even if Trump loses, they were so busy with the top of the ticket that they forgot everything else. The House will barely remain in Democrat control. The Senate most likely will not flip, preventing Biden from getting anything done. Republican control over the states has only grown stronger, which will be critical for redistricting next year. Trump just appointed his third Supreme Court justice, though it remains to be seen how any of those will pan out. This is still a win, whatever the result for President.</p>

        <p>It's in the bag... The courts upheld the constitution, all the Republicans had to do was provide evidence supporting claims for audits and recount in the few swings states.</p>
<p>The socialists only hope was that the judges not uphold the constitution... Now that audits and recounts have been approved due to massive fraud evidence presented and accepted in court this week, Trump will eventually be declared the winner of the election. There's no doubt he's the winner if they audit the ballots, mass fraud happened, it's not some loony theory, it's a fact that's been presented in court.</p>
<p>Orange is El Presidente for the next 4 years, the propaganda networks just haven't admitted to the public yet. That PA ruling is game over for the frauds, MI and WI have a ton of witnesses and video evidence, it was a gong show this election. It was literally a zoo, a free for all, all out fraud by the truck load of fake ballots type of shit.</p>

        <p>Dude, there is no path for Trump.</p>
<p>True, the far left was resoundingly rejected, but Trump underperformed nearly all down ballot Republicans.</p>

        <p>Republicans held the Senate and are up 10 seats in the house.  Plus state gains as well.  </p>
<p>The only race the democrats "won" is the one they cheated on.</p>

        <p>I have no doubt that fraud occurred.  I'm not convinced there's anything to be done to prove it though.</p>
