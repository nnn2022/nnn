        <p>I’m guessing that this account is a troll, since it has been around for 2 days and has only posted this rant on a bunch of subs. So I’m probably wasting my time here.</p>
<p>If you’re a real person, then just wow. But I don’t see how an actual human being could be this insane. Your own CDC link says that “Cases of reinfection with COVID-19 have been reported, but remain rare.” If reinfection was a Common thing it would’ve happened millions of times by now, since covid has been around since November 2019 or even earlier.</p>
<p>Remember 15 days to slow the spread? That was 8 months ago. It should be obvious that the government doesn’t have your best interest in mind. </p>
<p>Why must you wear a mask walking to you table and then you take it off when you sit down. Why are massive BLM protests okay but anti-lockdowns protests are not? If masks work, we should’ve had graduations in the spring. We should’ve been told it’s safe to vote in person. We should filled sports stadiums and had concerts. We should be fully back to in-person schooling. But no. It’s so painfully obvious that this is about control, not science.</p>
<p>Pandemics have never been handled in this way before. The Spanish Flu had very limited mask mandates and shutdowns in certain areas for small periods of time. COVID is a far weaker virus than that. </p>
<p>Millions of people die of tuberculosis per year. Flu and pneumonia kill countless elderly people per year. Why didn’t you wear a mask before COVID? Who knows how many lives you could have saved? Are you getting the point here? People die of different things, that’s part of life. </p>
<p>In October there were more suicides in Japan than ten months of covid deaths. But nobody cares about that anymore. Cancer deaths, suicides, overdoses, etc. are all skyrocketing this year. You are the selfish one. If you are so scared, you stay home. Don’t force your anti-social lifestyle on the rest of us. So please, stay home and wait for marching orders from the government. Live out your fantasy of being controlled by an authoritarian government.</p>

        <p>I've been working in healthcare this entire time. I've taken care of Covid positive patients and I've even been unmasked around Covid patients many times. I've been tested constantly every 4 days for 8 months and never once tested positive despite people breathing deadly Covid in my face. Explain how an "airborne" virus never managed to make me sick with complete exposure. I've also had constant antibody tests done so there's no argument for any asymptomatic bs. </p>
<p>I stand behind my opinion that masks are pointless, they're not stopping anything. My area has nearly a 100% mask compliance and well they didn't stop anything. Masks have a time and place to be used, but 24/7 to stop a coronavirus isn't one of them.</p>
<p>And Covid is pretty much the seasonal flu. Look how many cases of the seasonal flu there were this year, nearly none compared to usual atleast in my county... So strange. They're pretty much grouping seasonal flu and hospitalized pneumonia (which was pretty common this time of year before Covid) together to increase cases and cause hysteria.</p>
<p>Sorry you work at a grocery store and have to deal with everything, but that's truly not the fault of anyone here. If your husband is high risk well then he should stay in 24/7, not people who are healthy. </p>
<p>Your post is truly all the BS I'm sick of hearing.</p>

<p>Most here acknowledge it exists.  It's not worth locking down for though and destroying society.</p>
<p>Reinfections are media scare tactics.  A handful in 10s of millions of cases is nothing. The flu causes reinfections too in isolated cases.</p>
<p>Masks have pros and cons. Science hasn't proven than the pros outweigh the cons.  In 2018 the CDC examined all studies on masks form 1946 to 2018 and said there was not conclusive evidence that they work.  This was maintained by both the CDC and WHO until the COVID virus and all of a sudden that changed due to shoddy observational studied (ie. this country started using masks and death rates dropped).</p>
<p>We do gain long term immunity from COVID and don't need a vaccine to acquire herd immunity.</p>

        <p>No one will be immune forever of course.  And of course we only "know" that we have T cell immunity for up to 6 months.  This thing hasn't been going on for long. And by know we have empirical evidence for it.  We can derive from other infections that T cell immunity is long lasting. In SARS 1 patients the T cell response has been seen up to 17 years after initial infection.</p>
<p>And if for.some very weird reason (it would be extremely strange) we don't have long term T cell immunity after infection, a vaccine wouldn't change that since the immune system would be programmed to detect the same proteins.</p>
<p>The herd immunity is plausible because we know now that there is a significant percentage of the population that have prior antibody response and T cell response gained from previous coronavirus infections.</p>

        <p>Anecdotal data does not equate to scientific <a href="https://youtu.be/3GndKYJ4uBI">fact</a>. It's not going to stop the spread by itself but can reduce spread by up to 70% when the infected person is masked. That added with washing your hands, not touching your face and physically distancing yourself can be very effective. Since this virus has a long incubation period without symptoms it's prudent to have as many people as possible masked to keep the spread low.</p>

        <p>I agree with OP about the lockdown being elitist. Only certain people can work from home. Everyone else has to go out to work. Just like it was for every other pandemic in the entire lifespan of the human species. </p>
<p>The virus is real. The lockdown is BULLSHIT. We have never locked up healthy people during and illness. Ever. The sick were sometimes quarantined. It is unsustainable to have so many people and entire industries out of work and in the government dole. You cannot hide from a virus. </p>
<p>Being home and not able to see family and friends feels like solitary confinement. It’s detrimental to our mental health. It’s against the Geneva Convention. </p>
<p>OP’s anger at people just wanting to live their lives is misplaced. Pandemics are unfair. Good people die. In decades past, we used to understand that life is not guaranteed. Lots of people can’t wear masks for health and psychological reasons. You don’t know why a person is unmasked. Getting mad at others for not doing what you want is a great way to cause yourself a lot of unnecessary grief. The most anyone can do is take responsibility for themselves and make the best decisions possible.</p>

        <p>You also don't need to go to the grocery store to fill your social meter. It's fine that people can't wear masks for whatever reasons. Stores also have the right to refuse service for whatever reasons. You can't have it one way because you like it that way. It works both ways. You can have your retail products delivered to your house or pick them up at the curb without risking ANYTHING but your feelings. You also don't have to wear a mask doing these things. Everyone wins.</p>
