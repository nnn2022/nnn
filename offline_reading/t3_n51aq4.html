        <p>I work at a pediatric hospital.  I foresee a lot of seizure admissions.  Adult hospitals are getting a lot of healthy people in their 20s and 30s, with no history of seizures, suddenly seizing.  All have received 2nd dose in the past 7 days.</p>
<p>Pure coincidence, they were going to develop epilepsy anyway. /smh.</p>

        <p>Learn some reading comprehension.  I work at a pediatric hospital, as in children.  My colleagues work at adult hospitals.  They're the ones seeing the seizure patients.  I'm worried about children seizing due to the vaccine as more start getting it.  Hopefully, it won't happen.</p>
<p>But don't take my word for it.  Look at vids of people passing out after getting the shot.  See how their fists go to their chests and their legs start jittering?  That's not simple fainting.  People who faint don't present with decorticate posturing.</p>

        <p>Alright you dumbass, since were talking about reading comprehension, I said AS A WHAT? What on earth is your professional, medical capacity? Where on earth do you draw the conclusions from? What you heard...? </p>
<p>Have I seen videos...? Fucking no, because I‚Äôm on rotations in my hospital right the fuck now. I can tell from your assessment that you‚Äôre certainly not qualified to discuss flexor posturing with any certainty. </p>
<p>Lol no, I‚Äôm not gonna take your goddamn word for it... No one is having red nucleus disinhibition from a fucking oligonucleotide shot, and there are no concentrated rubrospinal implications related to a single ingredient in the shot.. Stop making up bullshit to agree with your biases. </p>
<p>You ever stopped to wonder ‚Äúwhy are these people filming rn?‚Äù No one could possibly be faking, and the people involved couldn‚Äôt have any motives like generating clicks with fear? Crazier still, Theyre somehow having isolated, bilateral brain stem injury to a degree reminiscent to SEVERANCE from an intramuscular shot whose ingredients could never possibly make it quickly into the bloodstream in this time span, then through the blood brain barrier, and then cause complete cell death in one specific place in the brain only? In 5 minutes??? Dude, come on. This is a bad take.</p>

        <p>&rt;Alright you dumbass, since were talking about reading comprehension, I said AS A WHAT?</p>
<p>That was a serious question?  Maybe if you hadn't made the "janitor" crack, I would  have taken seriously.  Really, you were just being rude.</p>
<p>&rt;
Pediatric hospitals deal with everyone from 0-18 you fucking ape</p>
<p>Which is why I don't see many adults.  Appears this "ape" is smarter than you.</p>
<p>&rt;You‚Äôre certainly not qualified to discuss flexor posturing</p>
<p>I can identify decorticate and decerebrate posturing pretty easily.  I've seen enough TBIs and seizures.</p>
<p>&rt;You ever stopped to wonder ‚Äúwhy are these people filming?‚Äù No one could possibly be faking?</p>
<p>So, you believe they're faking a seizure?  That's rich, and you call me dumb.  I did personally witness a coworker seize proximal to receiving the vaccine, and she had no h/o of seizures.  She postured, and I know she wasn't faking.  Sternal rub doesn't lie.</p>
<p>&rt;Theyre somehow having isolated, bilateral brain stem injury from an intramuscular shot whose ingredients could never possibly make it quickly into the bloodstream,</p>
<p>Ok, you're just using terminology you don't understand.  Brain stem injury usually causes death, seizures usually originate in the temporal lobe.  IM injections that aren't depots get into the blood quickly.</p>
<p>Plus, we already know the spike protein is directly toxic to the vascular endolthelium.  Vaccine causes cells to express this protein.  You do the math.  Get some help if needed.</p>
<p>Oh, and your porofanity and insults show a  lack of intelligence and self control.  You should get some anger management.  Then, get an education.</p>

        <p>Dude you‚Äôre a moron. I‚Äôll keep saying it, and I‚Äôll keep swearing because I like to. Suck it up snowflake. </p>
<p>I‚Äôm a medical student. There‚Äôs nothing I‚Äôm talking about that I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt understand.‚Äù You‚Äôre stating that the vaccine is chemically producing injury resembling TBI in one of the most ominous fashions, and that it‚Äôs being caused by an IM injection in a rapid reaction. You have <strong>no</strong> idea. And then you just made up a lobar origination for all seizures üòÇ</p>
<p>The entire point of injecting IM is so that it doesn‚Äôt go to the blood immediately. My school even trains aspiration to ensure you haven‚Äôt hit a vessel directly. Yes, muscle is highly vascular, but we‚Äôd do IV when we want fast or the ingredients were less irritant. </p>
<p>No, fool, I‚Äôm using terminology YOU don‚Äôt understand. Professionals can localize lesions based on posture, which is why decorticate and decerebrate are named the way they are, it‚Äôs a definition of relevant anatomy. If you‚Äôre having bilateral symptoms that could be classified as ‚Äúdecorticate‚Äù across <em>this many cervical levels</em>, the only options are that THE ENTIRE MOTOR CORTEX IS SEVERED FROM THE TRACT (loooooool) <strong><em>or</em></strong> there is a lesion in the midbrain of the stem rostral to the red nucleus. </p>
<p>The cell doesn‚Äôt express the damn spike protein produced by a vaccine. The mRNA enters, the thing is read, and it shits out a little copy of the protein. The proteins whole never sees the cell surface, let alone the endothelium üòÇ. Cells that translate the mRNA produce the protein it to get a picture, then immediately lyses it inside of the lysosome to present to T cells. You seriously have no idea.</p>

<p>Tonic-clonic seizures mimick decorticate and decerebrate posturing.</p>

<p>&rt;The entire point of injecting IM is so that it doesn‚Äôt go to the blood immediately.</p>
<p>Those are depot shots like benzathine PCN or Depot-Medrol.  Non-depot IM shots hit quickly.  IM morphine has an onset of action of 10-30 minutes, and it works in the brain.</p>
<p>&rt;you just made up a lobar origination for all seizures</p>
<p>You mean you've never heard of temporal lobe seizures?  Yet you say:</p>
<p>&rt;I‚Äôm a medical student.</p>
<p>Sounds like you should get your money back.  Your education is lacking.</p>

        <p>No, the viral spike IS NOT expressed on the APC surface! It is translated and destroyed by the lysosome, and it‚Äôs constituents are expressed on MHC I. You‚Äôre not getting injected with a virus, you‚Äôre getting a tiny piece of its gene map. If the products produced were to cause a reaction, it would not happen at the pharmacy where they just got injected... it‚Äôd take days, whatever videos you‚Äôre watching are not real. </p>
<p><em>YOU</em> CALLED THEM DECORTICATE. You‚Äôre sitting there googling shit and I‚Äôm telling you that what you‚Äôve said is happening is not. And seizures originate wherever in the brain that the patient is prone to hyper excitation (sometimes by trauma), then propagate. No one said I‚Äôve never heard of temporal seizures, just that you‚Äôre again making dumb claims that they must start there. Frontal and parietal are extremely common, you can‚Äôt just make that claim, and Every patient has differing origins. And they‚Äôre <em>not at all</em> easily confused with decorticate posture, you just don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre on about üòÇ</p>
<p>Morphine does not need to go to the brain to do its analgesic job... It works on enkephalin receptors in the spinal cord, that‚Äôs why it <em>can</em> work quickly, not by circulating to the fucking brain. No matter how much web MD you search, you‚Äôll never find bioavailability from IM injection to be rapid or consistent enough for you to be concerned about what you‚Äôre ‚Äúseeing in videos‚Äùor casually claiming sternal rubs on coworkers... since you‚Äôre googling shit, look up the effect of blocking mu receptors in the spine before giving systemic opiates. They‚Äôre not aiming for the brain for fast relief. </p>
<p>This is why google is not sufficient to know medicine...</p>

<p>&rt;Morphine does not need to go to the brain to do its analgesic job... It works on enkephalin receptors in the spinal cord,</p>
<p>And the spinal cord is proteceted by the meninges just like the brain.  The spine also has the functional equivalent to the blood brain barrier.  So, it takes just as long for morphine to get to the spine as it does the brain unless you're giving an epidural.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21674586/#:~:text=The%20blood%2Dspinal%20cord%20barrier%20(BSCB)%20is%20the%20functional,constituents%20of%20the%20spinal%20cord.</p>
<p>You know, playing Operation doesn't make you a med student.  The 4th grade science class you're in isn't med school lmao.  Seriously though, you need to seek psychiatric help.  You have no control over your emotions and are clearly delusional with this med school nonsense.</p>

        <p>We aren't all too stupid. Most everyone I know is planning on getting an injection, but I'm not. I'm a 15 year old with great health, and I get plenty of vitamin D.

        <p>Being young in general sucks. Being young during this time is especially bad. I feel really bad for all the younger kids who are growing up to a faceless world. Those kids will not be able to socialize when they're older.</p>
<p>I'm facing pressure from my family and a lot of my friends to get the injection. There is a group of my closer friends that won't get it. But it's crazy, my FAMILY is pressuring me into getting an experimental injection. My grandma tried to guilt trip me by saying me getting it would keep her safe. I'm not having it.</p>
