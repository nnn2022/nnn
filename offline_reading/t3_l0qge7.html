        <p>I think right now the things I am most afraid of are:</p>
<p>The tyranny getting even worse.</p>
<p>Never going back to complete normalcy.</p>
<p>And most of all, if we do regain complete normalcy, that history will paint us as the bad guys. Imagine if when this all ends, everyone will be like "We did it because we did our part and wore muzzles and didn't see people and were antisocial! Let's do this when another virus comes!" And "Because we did all the right things, eventually we killed the virus!" And "The reason it took so long was because of all the "conspiracy theorists" who think going out of your way to avoid a virus that isn't even that dangerous prolonged it!"</p>
<p>I can just see it in the future, all textbooks agreeing that we were the bad guys for refusing to give up our freedom, sanity, and normal way of life.</p>

        <p>I disagree. Who out of those who have sought to  restrict freedom and sow division have been on the right side of history?</p>

        <p>Well, if you stay silent and don’t act against this, you definitely won’t be the one writing them. </p>
<p>But honestly, imagine caring more about being maligned in the future than about being free to live today.</p>

        <p>Belive me, once the panic subsides they'll be able to look back and see the real facts. See how irrational it was. See the blatant fearmongering and shifting of goalposts. The effects of lockdown will reveal themselves over the coming years and once we know what they truly did lockdowns will not be viewed as good. The hysteria is what's blinding people, the crazy propaganda campaign. Once it subsides, I hope history will see what really happened.</p>

        <p>I don't think you understand.</p>
<p>There is no "complete  normalcy." Before covid, people were antisocial. Before covid, people were depressed. Before covid, there was no normal to speak of. Before covid, the spectre of a pandemic still existed just as much as a possible war could have inadvertently started thanks to the orange Cheeto to the south. I'm sure few would have called that normal.</p>
<p>And, when covid-19 is under some control, will it be some kind of normal? No, we'll have other issues. There will still be the flu. There will still be malaria. 50% of all of us will still be diagnosed with cancer. There will still be people, yes, that always wear masks. That's ok.</p>
<p>The public perceptions will always be self-serving. At the end of the day, all we can do is think about whether we're doing enough for the people we care about.</p>
<p>Amateur conspiracy theorists aren't the bad guys, the bad guys are the people that pay attention to them, believe them and join the group. Amateur conspiracy theorists should be politely ostracized so they can just stop.</p>
