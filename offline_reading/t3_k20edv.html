        <p>AIDS denialism is pretty far out there bro. I don’t think the majority of this sub is into fringe conspiracies like that. We just don’t want to be locked down and forced to wear masks over a virus slightly worse than the flu.</p>

        <p>I understand your (and anyone else, particularly a casual passerby of this sub)'s concern.</p>
<p>However, there are more connections here than probably any "miss me with that conspiracy shit" person wants to admit. For starters, HIV is sometimes tested with a PCR test, invented by Kary Mullis, a man who was very skeptical about the HIV-causes-AIDS assertion. What do we know about PCR tests, friend? Have you noticed anything about FALSE POSITIVES and EXAGGERATING "CASES" instead of proving an actual causal link between an active virus in somebody's body, and an illness they are experiencing? Particularly one that mirrors a bad flu in most people, but somehow flu has gone out of existence since the beginning of this year?</p>
<p>re: denialism, it's also a bit more nuanced than people make it. The claim isn't that AIDS doesn't exist, that people don't die - it's that there's no definitive, proven link between HIV (which might not even exist as we understand it), and "the" disease (really a bunch of different diseases which manifest as a result of) AIDS. And that a lot of the so-called science around that assertion has been bunk and deeply politically tainted. As in, people who questioned it very early on had their reputations ruined, and anybody pushing the official narrative got lots of funding. Do you think maybe that could skew the "science" a bit? Do you think contrarians and iconoclasts are receiving any funding right now to test their COVID theories? We already saw the official Hydroxychloroquine studies get shut down because of a journal article <strong>that was retracted the same week it was published</strong>. Do you hear anything about HCQ anymore? Hmmm ....</p>
<p>Did you know that HIV-causes-AIDS was announced at a press conference? That it didn't go through a rigorous peer review process first?</p>
<p>Did you know there were a lot of impeccably credentialed skeptics, who were eventually shouted down and deplatformed when they objected to the rushed conclusions? (Notice any parallels with today?)</p>
<p>Did you know that the man who discovered HIV had been previously working to discover a virus that caused cancer? And that AZT was originally a drug for cancer, until they found a much more lucrative use for it?</p>
<p>Did you know the man who discovered HIV was a relentless fame-seeker? Do you think that <em>maybe</em> that was a prestigious discovery? Can you imagine what his funding was like after that?</p>
<p>Do you know anything about the life (particularly the sex life) of AIDS patient zero? What did he have in common with the sex lives of the original AIDS victims?</p>
<p><strong>Let me ask you a question: what if we don't succeed in challenging all this COVID bullshit?</strong> What if we are drowned out, abolished from websites and social media, what if it's eventually made illegal to question or post "fake news" regarding this so-called pandemic? Can you see how in 5, 10, 20 years, anybody questioning the SCIENCE behind the COVID pandemic will be painted as an off-their-rocker "denialist?" And people will be afraid of associating with us and our opinions?</p>
<p>Remember, all of that happened back in the 1980s, when there was no Internet to share information and skepticism. We are unbelievably lucky today, that we have this resource. There was just about zero access to "unofficial" narratives back when broadcast media had nearly full control of public discourse.</p>
<p>I was very young when AIDS was going on, but I do distinctly remember the hysteria. Even in 1st grade we were being indoctrinated with medical fears that had NOTHING to do with our lives as children. I've only casually dipped into "AIDS denialism" in the past, because frankly it's not THAT interesting to me, and mercifully the authorities have stopped blasting the propaganda quite so much.</p>
<p>But I AM however very much alive, very much present, and very much currently under assault with COVID hysteria. We are losing our liberties at a furious pace. And it's easy for us to see that there's something fucky going on. I do agree, posting past stuff about HIV/AIDS probably does more harm than good, because people's minds are 10,000% CLOSED on that subject. But we are still in a precious window of time with respect to COVID, that we can keep the lid from being shut on this thing forever.</p>

        <p>Most community programs working to test for and medicate for HIV on the street were suspended. Yes, if you have a regular prescription you can still get your meds, but not everyone accesses them that way.</p>

        <p>You just went too far son. I happen to know three people in my area with HIV... it is the source of AIDS. Period.</p>
<p>It is not 'biochemically inactive and harmless' in the real world.</p>
<p>If you think it is? Go to an HIV positive person's house and ask them for some of their blood to inject in your body, then do it.</p>

        <p>&rt;It is not 'biochemically inactive and harmless' in the real world.</p>
<p>are they taking AZT or other highly toxic "medications" known to cause death, serious side effects and screw up the immune system?</p>
<p>&rt; If you think it is? Go to an HIV positive person's house and ask them for some of their blood to inject in your body, then do it. </p>
<p>would you randomly get blood injected from a random person REGARDLESS of anything else? of course not.</p>
<p>i however would not be afraid being around them and having any normal contact at all, because there is nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>the AZT and other poisons kill people or early on when it was still called GRID gay related immune deficiency you had kaposi's sarcoma (cancer) on people who had a very unhealthy life style (not talking about the sexual orientation here, but the extreme partying, drugs, etc... ). particularly the use of "poppers".</p>
<p>guess what poppers are linked to kaposi's sarcoma.</p>
<p>i would highly suggest, that you actually look at the history of what is claimed to be aids, rather than calling people like the person who made this post liars.</p>
<p>you could listen to people who actually dealt with this for example?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FwpTJ3M7nQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FwpTJ3M7nQ</a> </p>
<p>lindsey got almost murdered through AZT as a baby due a worthless positive HIV test.</p>
<p>THANKFULLY the parents did some research and the young woman you see in this video was able to recover from the harm of AZT.</p>
<p>i would highly suggest, that you watch the documentary called "house of numbers".</p>
<p>what do you know somehow there is still a full length version of it on youtube:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsT4GrimfLQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsT4GrimfLQ</a> </p>
<p>it contains interviews of very relevant experts today even like kary b. mullis the inventor of the PCR method, which as you probably know gets used in the covid-19 scam. sadly he died a few months, before the covid-19 scam with worthless pcr "covid-19" tests started.</p>
<p>also if you are so certain, that aids exists, why did it have its definition changed over time?</p>
<p>got cd4 t-cell count below 200? oh ups now you got aids according to one definition.</p>
<p>to quote kary mullis inventor of the PCR method:</p>
<p>&rt;we don't even know what aids is. aids is so hard to define, because they change the definition of it every year.</p>
<p>how can a clearly defined illness gets its definition expanded every year?</p>
<p>because it isn't a clearly defined illness. it is a huge and ever growing "syndrome", that you can throw all kinds of people into if you want.</p>
<p>however what does it matter what i say. just watch the documentary and use it as a start of your research. look at grid and poppers. look at azt. look at the children and adults who recovered after stopping AZT, get the whole damn picture, rather than listening to mainstream media propaganda, which you have done in regards to aids/hiv your whole life thus far.</p>
