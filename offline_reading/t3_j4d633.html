    <strong>Isn't it kinda ironic all the pro mask wearers and pro shutdown people usually have catched corona themselves and spread it to many of their friends or family members? How good examples they are!!!</strong>
    <p><p>Like, how can they with good faith say that they want government to shut down bars, cinemas, and force us to wear masks (Which is even worse for glasses wears due to the fog) while they themselves probably have dates and bang multiple people a month and meet many new people.</p>
<p>Seems like everytime some redditor talks about Le Evil anti maskers they say stuff like this:<br>
"<em>I just catched the coronavirus for a second time arghhh, last were a month ago and now me and my wife are sick, how dare these evil anti maskers right wing sociopaths protest against our lockdowns.</em></p>
<p><em>Shut every business that is that makes living fun, forbid them from seeing friends!!!!!!!!</em></p>
<p><em>P.S traveling 1 hours to get to work and talk with dozens of people is ok, little cog in the machine, don't you know that the virus only spreads at fun events not workplaces and schools dah</em></p>
<p><em>And me kissing my wife is perfectly ok. NOOOOO you can't just visit your friends, how dare you, murder murder, killer!!!!</em>"</p>
<p>Seriously fuck these people. Seems like most couples spread the virus to each others which meant if half of the population is in a relationship then a quarter of all coronavirus cases were due to husbands, wifes, boyfriends and girlfriends spread the virus to their partner. </p>
<p>Masks barely help, there were a statics that showed that it takes 100 thousand mask wearers just to stop a single case of the virus.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is either we shut things down equality or we open up again. How is it theirs or the government right to assume that them risking to get the virus from the partner is more important than us getting the virus from a friend???</p></p>

        <p>Or it’s all make believe.  </p>
<p>I haven’t washed my hands, wore a mask outside, or social distanced and somehow I’m getting extremely lucky and haven’t ran into ONE sick person this year since March.<br>
And I live in a large city, and my dad literally drives around the state for his work, and goes in all the grocery stores, didn’t wear a mask until they made him, and he’s never got it or met anyone who got seriously sick.  And my dad is considered a high risk person lol</p>
<p>Honestly, how is that possible in a “pandemic”.  </p>
<p>We aren’t that lucky.  It’s just fake.  </p>
<p>Doctors are paid $10,000 for covid case and $40,000 for covid death.  </p>
<p>The literally have a “wanted: dead” sign over our heads in the hospital with a $40,000 reward sign under it.  </p>
<p>Kinda hard to trust the death count when doctors have zero liability and free money to make.</p>

        <p>Just being honest.<br>
So let me tell you as a gross person... it hasn’t gotten me sick.<br>
Maybe my immune system is stronger because I don’t call in Johnson and Johnson and their chemicals to help my immune system everyday.. making my immune system lazy and weak. 
But yes I occasionally was my hands in public restrooms.. that’s about it. Not dead and feel great</p>

        <p>It's one thing to not have access to the resources to maintain hygiene, and a completely different thing to have access and just not use them. One is a matter of public health+economics and the other is a matter of laziness and disregard for others.</p>

        <p>So how does India have a lower death rate for covid than the US?   When they don’t have the economic resources to clean themselves, and have massive regions filled with literal trash. </p>
<p>Why is the US both the cleanest and sickest country in the world!?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because chemicals are chemicals. And our immune system has evolved over millions of years to be better than Johnson and Johnson at keeping us healthy. </p>
<p>It’s ironic that that I may actually be helping to strengthen people like you and your immune system because your immune system is spoiled and lazy. </p>

        <p>For a variety of reasons. 1) India doesn't efficiently nor accurately keep national records of deaths (roughly 86% of their deaths are nationally recorded). 2) Cardiovascular health issues are very common in USA due to lifestyle and are particularly dangerous in combination with covid.</p>
<p>The US isn't the cleanest nor sickest country in the world. It's sick because it's full of processed foods and lazy people and a healthcare system that profits like a mf.</p>
<p>India's life expectancy is also ten years lower than the USA. Wonder what hygiene has to do with that.</p>
<p>Either do your research, or go talk out your ass in r/conspiracy.</p>
