    <strong>Need info on JJ</strong>
    <p><p>My husband wants to take JJ but I can't find any info specifically on how that vax affects the body. I can find all kinds on Pfizer/Moderna and even the AZ one which I know is similar to JJ.</p>
<p>I know they all make spike protein, but would the adenovirus vector be the least harmful for long term? I know there aren't any long term data, I am vehemently opposed to these death shots, but my husband is convinced they work fine. I showed him that the spike protein is the one that creates the disease, and creates all the circulatory issues and vascular tissue damage. </p>
<p>I'm just trying to mitigate any damage he might suffer. I want to get Ivermectin on hand to help him and us clear out the spike proteins. I wanted to hand another baby but if he's sterilized after one shot...?</p>
<p>Update:
Unfortunately, he is on his way to take the JJ shot today. I am so disappointed. He said he was doing it for me, so that I wouldn't get hurt since I have had some major health problems last year. I lost my gallbladder and still have liver issues as well as having a stillborn baby last year due to a malformed placenta.</p></p>

        <p>I would avoid taking advice from the shill who provided you that phase 3 study. I mean, would you take advice from him when he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facts/comments/nszedv/the_squirting_aspect_of_female_ejaculation_is/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>posts this crap</strong></a>!? </p>
<p>He's a known troll on our subreddit, but he provides entertainment for us. </p>
<p>As for the J&amp;J shot, while it differs from Pfizer and Moderna, why can't your husband take Ivermectin or Hydroxychlorquine? Or vitamin C &amp; D? This virus is just a bad cold that many of us have survived from (average 2 to 5 days tops). </p>
<p>If he insists on taking it, then show him the following:</p>

<li>This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nswqns/helth_means_being_vaccinated_for_cov1d/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>poor lady</strong></a> who is basically feeble and unable to move.</li>

<li>And the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nmywux/lancet_paper_reveals_that_covid_jab_efficacy_is/"><strong>J&amp;J efficacy is really only 1.2%</strong></a>, so don't listen to weirdos like that other guy. </li>

        <p>He 'chose' the JJ over the others because he tested allergic to PEG a couple years ago when he was having an allergic reaction to some chemical at work. So, he really wanted Pfizer or Moderna but he also didn't want those because of convenience, JJ is only 1 shot appt to make.</p>
<p>When is the phase 3 trial finished for JJ? I looked up Pfizer and it won't be done until April 2023, after I showed him that is when he found out that info about the PEG allergy and so chose JJ instead.</p>
<p>I have tried the rational route, and the emotional route just makes him upset and then he refuses to listen. I was hoping that there might have been new info, like that Japanese study about, I believe it was spike protein concentration? Or maybe it was the LNP concentration. But something like that to at least delay him some while he thinks it over.</p>
<p>Maybe if I can delay him from taking it long enough for new info to come out showing the suspiciousness of these shots in MSM? Its a long shot, but its all I have at this point. He will mildly pass the alternative media sources, especially now with the Fauci emails are out saying exactly what I've been telling him since this mess started.</p>

        <p>To add to this: Here’s a phase 3 study, which included tens of thousands of participants over eight months in dozens of countries, reviewed by an FDA board, two external scientific review boards, and an editorial board by the New England Journal of Medicine. They found the J&amp;J vaccine to be safe and effective, and this included the findings of independent researchers.</p>
<p><strong>Raw Results:</strong></p>
<p>The per-protocol population included 19,630 SARS-CoV-2–negative participants who received Ad26.COV2.S and 19,691 who received placebo. Ad26.COV2.S protected against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days after administration (116 cases in the vaccine group vs. 348 in the placebo group; efficacy, 66.9%; adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI], 59.0 to 73.4) and at least 28 days after administration (66 vs. 193 cases; efficacy, 66.1%; adjusted 95% CI, 55.0 to 74.8). Vaccine efficacy was higher against severe–critical Covid-19 (76.7% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.6 to 89.1] for onset at ≥14 days and 85.4% [adjusted 95% CI, 54.2 to 96.9] for onset at ≥28 days). Despite 86 of 91 cases (94.5%) in South Africa with sequenced virus having the 20H/501Y.V2 variant, vaccine efficacy was 52.0% and 64.0% against moderate to severe–critical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration, respectively, and efficacy against severe–critical Covid-19 was 73.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Reactogenicity was higher with Ad26.COV2.S than with placebo but was generally mild to moderate and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the two groups. Three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19–related), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19–related).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>
<p>&rt;A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protected against symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and was effective against severe–critical disease, including hospitalization and death. Safety appeared to be similar to that in other phase 3 trials of Covid-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2101544</p>
<p>Here’s further analysis of a subset of the data by the National Institutes of Health:</p>
<p>&rt;The interim analysis assessed 468 cases of symptomatic COVID-19 among 44,325 adult volunteers in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, and the United States. The investigational vaccine was reportedly 66% effective at preventing the study’s combined endpoints of moderate and severe COVID-19 at 28 days post-vaccination among all volunteers, including those infected with an emerging viral variant. Moderate COVID-19 was defined as laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 plus either one of the following: evidence of pneumonia; deep vein thrombosis; difficulty breathing; abnormal oxygen saturation or a respiratory rate equal to or greater than 20; or two or more signs or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, such as cough, sore throat, fever or chills. Severe COVID-19 was defined as laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 plus evidence of clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness, respiratory failure, shock, significant organ dysfunction, hospital intensive care unit admission or death.</p>

        <p>He sounds dumb...</p>
<p>But seriously, i mean... what can you do?</p>
<p>Hopefully, he'll get the placebo and be fine.  </p>
<p>As far as him being sterile, unless he already is... i don't think its affecting men.  But we don't know yet.  Its definitely fucking with women more.</p>

        <p>He wont be sterilized. Afaik it collects in the ovaries not the testes. If he wants to risk all the side effects there's not much you can do. Hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and a few others effectively treat sars2 but he's probably getting flack from his coworkers and is tired of it.</p>

        <p>This is what I've suspected, which is why I want to get some Ivermectin on hand to help him pass the spike proteins in his system.</p>
<p>And yes, his work and coworkers are all taking the jab and he's surrounded by propaganda. I've tried to show him that there is strong doubt clouding these poisons but he says he thinks the risk is worth it because he thinks for his age group he is at risk. I keep showing him the numbers but he says to him, he doesn't want to risk it. </p>
<p>To his credit he is not forcing any of us to take it and says it is his choice. I agree, to an extent, but his choice affects our family. He works, I stay at home to raise our kids. If he were to die or become crippled? This is where my concern comes from.</p>
