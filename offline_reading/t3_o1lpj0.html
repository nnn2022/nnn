    <strong>Screwed up menstrual cycle out of nowhere after being around vaccinated gym members.</strong>
    <p><p>So like many women, my menstrual cycle suddenly got weird around the end of 2020, when I know many of the members of the gym I work at got vaccinated, including many of the students I have with me in my small group fitness classroom.</p>
<p>I’ve been on birth control for over 5 years and been extremely regular because of that. Then suddenly my period started coming a week early, while still on my active pills, and would go for 2-3 weeks. I had no idea why, it’s never done this before, and I couldn’t think of any sort of catalyst for this. I wasn’t under any stress, no change to diet or exercise, nothing.</p>
<p>I now have NO period at all, and today I finally got my hormone blood test results back, and.....they’re pretty much completely normal, except for my FSH levels being just BAAARELY elevated. 
My doctor told me she has no idea why my period has stopped or what caused it to act up in the first place, and is sending me to a gynecologist to try and find some answers.</p>
<p>After hearing so many stories from other women dealing with the same thing after being around vaccinated people, I can only assume that’s what I’m dealing with as well, and I’m furious.
Not only do I feel like absolute garbage (fatigue, horrible acne, mood swings, etc), but I’m having to drop tons of money on medical bills. Even though I didn’t get the vaccine myself.
I just feel violated and helpless, and don’t know what the future holds for my health.</p></p>

        <p>My wife and I went on vacation to NM in May. Her grandparents were vaccinated, a few weeks after getting back she noticed her cycle was irregular and painful and lasted longer. She is also fatigued, suddenly became depressed and doesn’t do anything all day. If she could lay in bed all day she would. Idk what the fuck to do</p>
<p>Only thing that has changed is she came into contact with vaccinated family members.</p>

        <p>Nothing you can do. Doctors don’t know what to do, they don’t know how or why she’s suddenly having these issues after years of normal cycles. </p>
<p>It’s mind blowing that all the pro covid vax people assume all this is just a coincidence.</p>

        <p>Such a horrible feeling, having a doctor look you in the eye and basically tell you you’re fine.
I went into my appointment today worried about getting some sort of scary news with my blood test results. It never even crossed my mind that there wouldn’t be any news at all.</p>

        <p>Yea that’s also frustrating. Testing shows everything is normal so they shrug it off as “eh ur just going through a tough mental state” or “eh it happens sometimes your cycle will become irregular”</p>
<p>After years and years of normal regular cycles it just so happens to be happening now? </p>
<p>I like ur username by the way lol</p>

        <p>I have anecdotal, but personal, evidence. I hung out with a girl that had just gotten vaccinated that day. One of the first wave to get it. The very next morning I felt sick as fuck. So did she. She thought maybe we were both hungover, even though we didn't really drink very much at all.</p>
<p>I stayed sick for about 3 days before I decided to get it checked out. I tested positive for mono and strep throat. But no fever! At any point, actually. I ended up in the hospital for two days because my tonsils "kissed" very hard and was closing my breathing passage. </p>
<p>I was sick for almost a whole month, like three and a half weeks. Not a single soul that I came into contact with was ever sick with anything. And I work from home and have a very set routine, so I know everyone I came into contact with. </p>
<p>It's definitely weird. I'm not saying it's a 100% link, but you don't have to do anything to convince me it was.</p>

        <p>I'm getting to the point where I believe this might have been the plan all along. Attack human fertilization, and kill as many as possible with  a jab with self spreading abilities. Don't know if this is true, but I heard that the vaxxed are not only spreading the S1 spike protein, but they are also spreading the mRna encoding, thereby infecting the ones who wouldn't take the jab. If you breathe in or touch the S1 protein or the mRna encoding, it can enter your body, and begin the same process as someone who took the death jab, then we would be fated to the same effects.</p>

        <p>I don’t doubt that for a second. Luckily (I guess?) my husband and I are choosing to not have kids, but I’m expecting a lot of people who are trying to conceive after vaccination to struggle. I know my brainwashed brother and sister-in-law said they were actually waiting to try for another kid until after they were vaccinated. Should be interesting.</p>

        <p>Yes, yes it will be interesting to see the rest of the year and next play out. I was around a vaxxer recently, and felt sick slightly after. Did a health protocol and was better next day physically, but my concern is still there. My gut tells me this protein and mRna shedding bs is real, and we are only beginning to see the effects. Lawd hav merceh!</p>

        <p>I already have a chronic illness (either genetic or developed after contracting Lyme disease in high school, it’s anyone’s guess), so these hormonal issues, or whatever they are, are making my pre-existing issues flare up tenfold. I was doing super well for a couple years, now it’s like I’m back at square one. Extremely disheartening.</p>

        <p>My heart goes out to you. Stay strong. You say you might have a predisposition due to prior conditions? Hmm, I wonder if people with such situations might be the demographic of people with weakened immune systems to show up effects first? From my understanding, the amount you get exposed to will have a bearing on fast and hard the effects of being around these proteins and encodings hit, it's not known at this time. It's funny, people like us are fighting for survival of the species from a depop agenda, and then the trolls come here to mock, if only they knew we were fighting for them to. Hard times are coming for sure.</p>

        <p>I definitely do. Really crappy genes, both my parents have autoimmune diseases, and I also grew up getting bronchitis every winter, went into pneumonia a couple times.
That being said, I got Covid end of 2019, and while it sucked and lasted a long time, it wasn’t really any worse than bronchitis for me.</p>

        <p>Had every symptom. Woke up with a fever, dry cough, upset stomach, headache, loss of taste and smell, etc.
Went to urgent care, and I’ll never forget this, they told me “yeah, we’ve been seeing this a lot recently. It’s not the flu or bronchitis, we’re not really sure WHAT it is”.</p>

        <p>Oh boy does r/conspiracy have a lotta info for you. From what I have gleened, its a mass negatine eugenics conspiracy with Bill Gates and Fauci (amongst others) at its head. After having seen some clips of Bill Gates stating things like 'with more people vaccinated and healthy they will choose to have less kids' and discussing eugenics and vaccienes together it really does have me wondering if this might be right.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry you're experiencing this. I've read so many stories now about the very strong indication that vaxxed people are shedding the viral spike protein via breath (water vapour) or touch (sweat glands). </p>
<p>Here's some info that I thought I'd share:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nxk52j/inventor_of_mrna_vaccine_says_vaccinating_during/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>this interview</strong></a> got a bit testy with one of the guests (Steve on the right is overtly passionate about this scamdemic), it was one of the best educational videos I've seen on how the spike protein from these vaccines are traveling throughout the body, and are piling up in organs such as the ovaries. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Journalist <strong>Naomi Wolf</strong> started reporting about those who've been vaxxed now have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nmfvpe/i_think_the_shot_causes_people_to_shed_something/gzokeyj/?context=3"><strong>menstrual cycle issues</strong></a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just for reference purposes only, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/search/?q=shedding&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new"><strong>here is a link to all recent posts involved with any viral protein shedding from any of the covid-vaccines</strong></a>. Just keep it handy for now. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, one of the pioneers of mRNA technology <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nwb5dn/dr_luigi_warren_inventor_of_mrna_says_vaccinated/"><strong>Dr. Luigi Warren had his tweet censored by "Fact-Checkers" on Twitter</strong></a> when he said vaccinated people <strong>do shed the spike protein</strong>, but in miniscule amounts where he felt that it wouldn't cause harm to others (I beg to differ from what I experienced). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's important to note that <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318902"><strong>the spike protein itself causes the disease/symptoms in people</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ryan Christian (aka The Last American Vagabond) made this very eye-opening video about <a href="https://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/self-spreading-vaccines-self-amplifying-mrna-vaccines-covid-vaccine-menstrual-disruption/"><strong>Self-Spreading Vaccines, Self-Amplifying MRNA Vaccines &amp; COVID Vaccine Menstrual Disruption</strong></a> was one of his best works (and he always cites his sources near the bottom of the page). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And even Pfizer confirmed that covid-vaccines are shedding, <a href="https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/05/04/pfizer-confirms-covid-vaccine-shedding-leading-to-menstrual-cycle-disruption-is-possible/"><strong>leading to possible menstrual cycle disruption</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of which, independent and investigative journalist <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nmfvpe/i_think_the_shot_causes_people_to_shed_something/gzokeyj/?context=3"><strong>Naomi Wolf started reporting about how women were suffering from a variety of severe complications/issues with their menstrual cycles</strong></a>, which may have been induced to either being living with vaxxed-family or working with vaxxed-people in very close proximity. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nuknwn/hows_this_for_shedding/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>This post</strong></a> would fall under the category of physical/bodily shedding due to the person's severe reaction to getting vaccinated, so it's not one of the viral protein shedding links that I was referring to before, but I will get to that shortly. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay real close attention to what former Pfizer scientist Michael Yeadon had to say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nlphfh/michael_yeadon_full_interview/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>about this scamdemic</strong></a>. Or you can just look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nl72px/chief_scientist_of_pfizer_mike_yeadon_it_is_now/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>this link</strong></a> if you want the short answer of his video statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dr. Ariyana Love wrote an article titled <a href="https://ambassadorlove.wordpress.com/2021/05/02/the-covid-vaxxed-must-be-quarantined-expert-consensus/"><strong>THE COVID VAXXED MUST BE QUARANTINED!</strong></a>, where it may be possible that the vaxxed are shedding harmful viral spike proteins. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even some crazy and callous vaxxed people are willing to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/nkpm5j/what_were_up_against_this_is_insanity/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"><strong>expose unvaccinated by hanging out with them on purpose</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've heard that taking Ivermectin can prevent the spike protein from binding within your body, and can neutralize it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drink <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/no8i3c/pine_needle_tea/"><strong>Pine Needle Tea</strong></a>, which is to help not have the vaccine's spike proteins connect to you. I think you have to drink a lot prior to your shot. The actual article is called "Possible Antidote for the V-Serum and the Current Spike Protein Contagion": https://archives.simplelists.com/nfu/msg/16539359/?fbclid=IwAR267I-dhVAygtNCur1yOmxvpibUUurjb0Q_saT4GQUUUpf73wPOg3dTK5Y</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was this post about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/nq292a/i_got_my_2nd_vaccine_saturday_and_regret_it/h09fm15/?context=3"><strong>drinking licorice root tea</strong></a> prior or after your shot, so that the spike protein from binding to the ACE2 receptor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That same poster in the 2nd bullet point also provided <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/nq292a/i_got_my_2nd_vaccine_saturday_and_regret_it/h0fyjar/?context=3"><strong>another post with medical links</strong></a> about how licorice root tea helps mitigate the damage caused by the covid vaccines.</p>

        <p>This is where I'm confused though, my husband took the shot from JJ maybe a week ago. I was very hyper aware of the menstrual changes going on in several online accounts but I thankfully have not noticed any difference.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder if the Moderna/Pfizer shots are the culprit specifically of all these injections. My husband had symptoms within an hour or two of getting injected. He was laid up in bed with a high fever, chills, body ache and general malaise. This went away overnight but he was still tired for the next 2 days. At worst I got some pain from a bile duct blockage around the same time as he got his shot and again a few days later. I made him keep away from the kids and I for a week, I wanted 2 weeks but it was very sad to keep him from hugging our kids any longer. Especially once he was recovered and no longer feeling ill. He made the argument that waiting longer means he produces more spikes but it drops off production? I told him we can't be sure of that, we can't be sure of anything. He took the shot because of work pressure, and he is genuinely concerned of me falling ill since I do have some major health issues regarding my liver. I wish he didn't have to but we are here now so trying to mitigate any fallout.</p>
<p>I don't know what to think about all this anymore. He seems to be doing okay and I don't seem to be having any changes and neither do our kids show any difference.</p>
<p>Again, I know I am hyper aware of all these reactions so I've been very careful about attributing fault.</p>

        <p>These accounts of unvaccinated people experiencing adverse reactions from being around people who have taken a COVID-19 vaccination are becoming more common.  Osteopathic and Naturopathic doctors are responding to these reports (like yours) and have ideas for countering ill effects.  I think it is still too early for anyone to say conclusively what will work, but here are some ideas which I have heard presented:
Pine Needle Tea - prevents the spike protein from adhering at the ACE2 receptor.
Sauna - upregulates heat shock proteins  which help to refold damaged proteins within the body. 
Time Restricted Eating - activates autophagy which will work to remove damaged proteins.
Keep your Vitamin D, C, zinc levels up because these are critical to fighting infection. </p>
<p>I haven’t experienced what you are describing and I am not a doctor. My concern is that you should not be punished for guarding your well-being and I would like to hear that you have overcome this malady and returned to a state of health.  Let us know, if you could.</p>

        <p>I’ve been wanting to give the pine needle tea a try soon. I think I’m gonna order some online though, can’t figure out if our pine trees are toxic or not.
Definitely gonna keep up with my vitamins too.
Would love to hear if you know of any other possible tricks to try and reverse any effects. I’m willing to try anything that’s ultimately harmless and doesn’t break the bank.</p>

        <p>Uhm, my gf is experiencing something similar. </p>
<p>She was spotty for one day, and then it was over. She's usually light but it does tend to be over a 3-4 day period. That was last month.</p>
<p>This month, seems to be the same story.</p>
<p>She already took 2 pregnancy tests a week apart; negative. She's around vaxxed people on the reg of all ages. She's been on birth control for about 8 years.</p>

        <p>Not sure why that matters to you so much, but I guess if it’s bothering you that much?
It’s named after the first gift I gave my husband when we were still dating and I was working as a special effects makeup artist. Had a little bow on it and he kept it on his desk at work. It’s an inside joke with us at this point.</p>
