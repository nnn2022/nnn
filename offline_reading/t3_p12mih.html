    <strong>Experience just now at a pediatric office</strong>
    <p><p>Took my son to a pediatric appointment we booked. They no longer accept walk ins. A family with a sick infant was told to leave and book an appointment "because of covid." </p>
<p>Everyone must wait outside (in Miami, in the summer). Text to say you are there. They call and say report to a specific room #. Everyone 2+ in masks, staff, kids, parents. Regardless of vax or natural immunity.</p>
<p>Showed the doctor I can fog my glasses through the mask. Reminded him could fog my glasses with 5+ layers. Said you went to medical school, you know. You know how small a virus is, and respritory droplet size versus what the mask filters. You know these masks are useless and just for show. He just said "it's our policy."</p>
<p>His daycare. Same story. Kids 3+ must be muzzled. Parents to be masked for drop off. Luckily he's just under 2. Staff masked all day. My family got covid through the daycare despite their measures was mild we are fine. Asked and they said its "just our policy" for the whole chain. And that they are following cdc guidelines. </p>
<p>Feels like we are living in some dystopia hell. Trying to keep my son from being exposed to this madness as much as possible.</p></p>

        <p>2+ that’s fucking insane. </p>
<p>In the UK I saw a mother walking her 2 year old through a car park earlier in a mask which was literally taped to her face so she couldn’t pull it off explaining that it made her a big girl….</p>

        <p>Horrible that's child abuse.</p>
<p>I work in healthcare. Hospitals across the country are mandating staff have the shots. Some luckily allow for religious or medical exemption. Though heavily pressure staff, mandate masks for them etc.</p>
<p>The clinicians are bought into the propaganda. Fanatical about it. They are making top dollar to produce tiktok videos. </p>
<p>My own workplace now is demanding every employee declare "vaccination status" so they can be tracked in a database. Osha, eeoc, hippa all say it's totally fine to ask this info or mandate the vax. Employees in person will be segregated, masked etc.</p>
<p>Feels like before long even remote staff will be required to have the jab. Work for a top firm in the industry.</p>
<p>Even in FL despite DeSantis, businesses are still mandating masks for staff and customers.</p>
