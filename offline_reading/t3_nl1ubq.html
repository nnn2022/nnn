    <strong>This place is called No New "Normal" right?</strong>
    <p><p>If anyone has ever seen the documentary "Earthlings" from 2005, you should realize by now that our world was never normal to begin with. We all want to fight the lockdowns and restrictions, to prevent another holocaust, to stop tyranny from taking over the world, etc. I get it, believe me, I'm not disregarding anyone's thoughts or stances on that. My problem is that we all seem to forget that there already IS a holocaust taking place, and has been for YEARS. The Animal Holocaust. This isn't a "cOnSpIrAcY" or something that can be "debonked." This is a FACT and I DARE anyone to watch this documentary, regardless of what your views are, from beginning to end and then to try and convince yourself that this is "normal" or, if you're insane enough, convince yourself this is fake. </p>
<p>I have spent the last 5 years looking into all the "conspiracies" and nothing is comparable to this. Like I said, I get it,  we don't want their "New Normal" being pushed by the higher ups to manifest. But simply watch this documentary and try to convince yourself that this place was normal to begin with. Remember, this came out in 2005 and features footage long before then. </p>
<p>We all collectively have a lot of work to do to fix this mess, so why not start by bringing simple awareness to a problem that you and I CAN control. We may not be able to stop the machine, at least not at this moment. But what we can do is take some responsibility, take control our own actions (which includes what we put into our body), take a good long look in the mirror and ask "what can I do to make the world a better place?"  and to learn about what we've been doing to our other earthly inhabitants. Earth and freedom isn't just for us humans, it's for every living thing. No one can really argue this point without automatically sounding like the very people we are so against. This isn't some veganism preach either, this is just one simple solution to take back our power in the form of a rant.</p>
<p>In simpler words, if you support the anti-establishment/anti-lockdown/pro-freedom/pro-whatever movements in hopes of bringing the world back to "normal", yet you still eat meat and are still unaware of these slaughter chambers, YOU are still part of the problem. </p>
<p>End of Rant. </p>
<p>Here's the link to the documentary which a good 90% of you won't watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gqwpfEcBjI&amp;t=4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gqwpfEcBjI&amp;t=4s</a></p></p>

        <p>I'm going to eat twice the meat I normally would tommorow just because I saw this post.</p>
<p>Seriously though, factory farming is abbhorant. I get it. But organic grass fed meat is simply too costly for most to eat. Same with veagan food. Sure, it's possible to get all you need from plants if you also suppliement, but again, who can afford this? 🤷</p>

        <p>I agree, the odds are stacked against us to an extent. But to me at least, it's a sacrifice worth enduring. Especially after watching Earthlings and the documentary Fat, Sick and Nearly dead.</p>

        <p>$250 a month for a good vegan diet.  Really that’s all I spend and sometimes even less so I don’t throw food away. $8.21 a day avg @4 meals and snacks. That’s $2.05 per meal. My monthly beer and dip cost is sometimes twice that. Not so bad. r/veganrecipes. It’s not the garbage food most people think.  Most liquor is vegan too so that’s a bonus.</p>

        <p>A friend of mine described in great detail what Earthlings was all about, and afterwards I felt a mixture of extreme sadness, and overall hopelessness. </p>
<p>This is why I don't eat certain meats, but I have not been able to cut out fish or chicken (and I feel very bad about it). I even contemplated suicide as I don't really want to live anymore (not just based on that movie, but other things that are contributing towards the death of Mother Nature). </p>
<p>I feel that going the route of Permaculture is the only way forward. Or living the lifestyle of the Amish or Mennonites or maybe even like the North American Natives is the only way forward.</p>

        <p>Thank you so much, I cried just now. I needed that reaffirmation that I'm still needed here. Sometimes I don't feel that way, but there are important loved ones who are depending on me for their own survival, so I can't leave yet. I just feel a bit hopeless. I think I'm going to pray and ask for help. I'll also try to see the bigger picture. </p>
<p>My work place is starting to crack down on those who haven't taken the shot, and someone high up told me I'm being a bad example towards others I'm well known for not taking the shot.</p>
