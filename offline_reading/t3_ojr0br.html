    <strong>Why people don't ever think that elites went in on a intellectual war against us? Why is this possibility always dismissed?</strong>
    <p><p>"No they can't do that" says someone when you talk about this. Is it really not possible that the elites wanna control us or worse, destroy us? Does people never read? Why did French rev happen? Does rich people and govs(they too are rich) always care for poor people? Since when?? </p>
<p>And ofc they cant just directly control you with brute force, we are way too many. Instead they will choose some other methods,  such as fear, taxes etc.</p></p>

        <p>In order to answer this question, I have to go back to when I was "asleep"... my awakening was slow, then SUDDEN. My mum has always been into alternative news sources, so growing up around them, I always rolled by eyes and was slightly embarrassed by these ideas that weren't "normal" or "popular". When I was 17 (nearly 25 now), mum showed my family this movie called "September Clues". It was about 9/11 of course, and again, I rolled my eyes because "like, why do all these things have to have such lame/dramatic names?"</p>
<p>There was one point in that movie, where somebody had lined up all the broadcasts from each channel of the towers, and all the broadcasts were a) <strong><em>from similar angles but with completely different sky backgrounds</em></strong> and b) <strong><em>had a "door closing" noise and a "beep" noise at the exact same time frames on each broadcast</em></strong>, suggesting they were all filmed at the same location regardless of the network. I remember, in all my arrogance, not having a  rational explanation for that.</p>
<p>Three years later, P-zzag-te came out. I remember my brother explained it to me and I was barely interested like, "Oh, really? Damn." Can't remember where I found it; I think it was on the P/G sub-reddit that existed briefly, but somebody had created a blog filled with pics and screenshots, and the attitude was "draw your own conclusion". When I saw the things on that blog post, there was a very strong instinct inside of me that what I was seeing was not only convincing, but real.</p>
<p>Maybe only some people are destined to wake up, or maybe we all are at different times. It could take years or it could happen suddenly. All I know is, once you wake up, you NEVER fall asleep again.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of factors about this, but I think a few noteworthy need to be:</p>
<p>If people realize they have been wrong their whole life about the belevolence of their governing officials, then:</p>
<p>What else are they falsely believing
Who is going to be their advisor or fact-checker if not the govt
Could they ever trust their government again?
Did they EVER have a situation, initiative, that was purely about
the benefit of the people?
How do they define their actions of "benefiting the public"</p>
<p>It's a much more comfortable belief to think, "sure, the government gets things wrong sometimes, doesn't always know what the public need or are asking, and is inefficient but we need them, what else do we have?" Type of belief.</p>
