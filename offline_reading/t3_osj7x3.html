    <strong>mRNA and alternatives.</strong>
    <p><p>So I see alot of stuff here about mRNA vaccines. Especially how they're new and untested. I completely understand why someone might be skeptical of some new technology, and I've seen a few comments that articulate that concern well.</p>
<p>So my question is (I have no idea where else to ask) thus:</p>
<p>Why isn't anyone agitating for any of the dozen or so old school inactivated vaccines that are on the market? They're old, proven technology used for decades with a proven track record. And they're available.</p></p>

        <p>There is also a proven method in testing these.</p>
<p>This method usually takes years. Not months, years.</p>

<p>Even if this wasnt the case, vaccines are nowhere near as great as people claim.</p>
<p>Which is also why I for one would like even more than years, I want generations. Multiple and in a proper study, not funded by those who profit by any outcome, where every number and how it was gathered is transparent.</p>

        <p>From what I understand it has to do with the spike protein but that vaccines are showing to fail at this as well.  Delta cases are on the rise due to a vaccine dependency.  </p>
<p>These Vaccines are not meant to cure anything.  They are meant to prevent disease and death.  They will not protect against mutated strains.  </p>
<p>This is why if you are not at risk for disease or death you should not take a vaccine.  </p>
<p>Dr. Robert Malone was a creator of the mRNA technology that now speaks out against it.  There’s a great interview here.</p>
<p>https://www.kristileightv.com/post/dr-robert-malone-responds-to-critics-shares-bioethics-concerns-more</p>
<p>But in all reality this virus is not dangerous enough to the general population to require a vaccine.</p>

        <p>I'll start from the end and work my way up.</p>
<p>First off, with covid being the third leading cause of death in the US over the last twelve months(closely behind cancer), I don't think you can honestly say that it isn't dangerous to the general population. We have broad societal agreement on vaccinating for diseases that kill far less people than covid has, and if you told me that if they invented a vaccine for cancer they couldn't easily make a case to require it I'd call you a liar.</p>
<p>Now, if by general population you mean healthy young people, then sure, that case could be made. Fucking cold hearted, leaving the old and sick to die, but I can see it. Whenever someone suggests China created covid, thats the argument that plays in my mind.</p>
<p>As for mRNA vaccines and whether or not they're safe, that's 100% a legitimate debate. It seems clear to me from research that mRNA as a technique was chosen because it offered a quicker development, and someone made the decision that whatever risks that might arise from its lack of long term data was outweighed by the human savings of an earlier vaccine. Wether that was a good decision or not we might not know for decades. I'll accept that. </p>
<p>But I don't see the next step to that, which is if not mRNA, then what? There's plenty of alternatives: AZ and JJ aren't mRNA, Cuba has two, all of the Chinese/Indian/Russian old school types. Saying that mRNA is unproven and potentially risky is a completely different argument than saying we shouldn't vaccinate at all.</p>
<p>Everyone should get a vaccine. We don't vaccinate to protect healthy people, we do it to protect the sick and vulnerable. Do you have parents? Children? A pregnant wife? A friend with a transplant? I don't have to worry about my kids getting polio or smallpox or any of these other diseases because of vaccination and the idea that we all agree to assume a small amount of risk (bad reactions happen) because that risk is outweighed by the benefit of being free of these diseases.</p>

        <p>I agreed with you until "everyone should get a vaccine". I don't believe in mandates generally, but with the vaccines we have for covid vaccinated people can still spread it so they're not protecting anyone else.</p>

        <p>That's not how vaccines, ANY vaccine, work.</p>
<p>A vaccine doesn't eliminate spread, it only reduces it. The idea isn't to stop the virus completely, only reduce it enough to keep any outbreak limited.</p>
<p>You might have heard during discussions about transmissibility the idea of the basic reproductive number, or R number, where if one person catches a disease, it can be expected to spread to 2 or 3 or 20 other people. As long as that number is greater than 1, we can expect that disease to grow over time, as each person subsequently infects more than one other person. Conversely, if that number is less than 1, we can expect that disease to disappear over time.</p>
<p>For an R number of 2, 100 sick people can be expected to infect 200 people, who will then infect 400, and so on until we have a pandemic. For an R number of 0.5, 100 people can be expected to infect only 50 people, who then infect 25, 12, 6 etc until it disappears.</p>
<p>Reducing the R number is how viruses and other infections are controlled and eliminated. One way to do it is with social distancing, masks, hand washing, and similar steps taken to reduce opportunities for spread.</p>
<p>Another way is through vaccines. Preliminary studies are showing an efficacy of around 90% for Pfizer. So if we talk specifically about covid, with an R number somewhere around 5, we would have 100 people who potentially infect 500 people, then 2500, then 12500.</p>
<p>But if 90% of the population was vaccinated, the math would look very different. 100 people would expose 500 but only 95 would get sick, the 50 who are unvaccinated and the 10% of vaccinated people who  get sick despite the shot. Those 95 go on to infect 90, then 85, and so on until the disease is largely gone.</p>
<p>The point isn't to stop it altogether, but to make it sufficiently difficult for the virus to keep spreading. This can and does work, and it's been responsible for eradicating lots of diseases that used to run rampant.</p>

        <p>“That is not how vaccines, ANY vaccine work”. </p>
<p>That is absolutely untrue. There are vaccines such as those for smallpox or measles or HPV that confer sterilizing immunity, meaning that people vaccinated won’t get it or spread it. Every once in a while, for whatever reason, they fail to work in an extremely small amount for people, but for the vast majority, they give sterilizing immunity. </p>
<p>And the efficacy of the vaccines in preventing INFECTION has plummeted with new variants. What you described isn’t going to happen.</p>

        <p>HPV vaccines have a 97-98% efficacy rate, comparable to the 90-93% rate of something like pfizer against plain covid. Measles vaccines are similar at around 97%. Smallpox is around 95%. (All CDC figures)</p>
<p>No vaccine is 100% effective at preventing illness. They also don't claim to be.</p>
<p>Now you're right about variants. Higher R numbers for something like Delta means that a either a higher percentage of the population would require immunity (either through vaccinations or illness), or greater non-pharmacological methods: hand washing, social distancing, masks etc, or a combination of both in order to reduce transmissions. But so what? that's not an argument against vaccines.</p>

        <p>I said those vaccines don’t work for a small amount of people, but the majority of people they do work for can’t get or spread the disease. Completely different case from covid, where people vaccinated are getting and spreading covid. Quite a bit. Now the only 90% range protection is against severe disease and death. No matter how many people get it, we’re not getting herd immunity from these vaccines. And they have risks, which look to be much more significant than with traditional vaccines. Taking those risks is probably worth it for people who have a big change of getting severe covid or dying from it, but not for people who are likely to have a mild to moderate case. But balancing the risks and benefits should be for each person to decide for themselves.</p>

        <p>These other vaccines work exactly the same as the covid vaccine.

<p>A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm">study</a> from the CDC showing 80-90% reduction in symptomatic AND asymptomatic infection amongst fully vaccinated healthcare workers. A study from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01316-7">Israel</a> and another from <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00628-0/fulltext">the UK</a> showing vaccinated persons who become infected with covid have both a much smaller viral load (3-4x lower) and take less time for the virus to disappear (roughly 1 week sooner). <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.10.21253173v1">Three</a> <a href="https://www.ijcm.org.in/article.asp?issn=0970-0218;year=2020;volume=45;issue=3;spage=278;epage=282;aulast=Sarkar">more</a> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30985-3/fulltext">studies</a> indicating that a lower viral load leads to less transmissibility. All signs are pointing towards vaccines making a giant dent in cases, hospitalizations and death.</p>
<p>Lets talk about risk. Out of 34.6 million covid cases, 611 000 people died. Assuming you're an average person, your risk of death sits at around 1.7%. Now, as for vaccines, the most common concern I hear about is TTS from the J&amp;J vaccine. Out of 21+ million doses in the us, there have been 39 reported cases of TTS. That's 0.00018%. You would have more than 7000x better odds of dying from covid than getting TTS from a J&amp;J.</p>
<p>Or what about reports of swelling around the hearts of younger people who got the mRNA shots? Well, there have been about 373 million mRNA shots and a reported 2000 cases of myocarditis. </p>
<p>These vaccines could be 1000 times more dangerous than they appear to be, and would still be an order of magnitude safer than covid itself.</p>

        <p>Those aren’t the vaccines I stated confer sterilizing immunity. And they don’t “work exactly the same as the covid vaccine”. The covid vaccine at best, is more like the flu shot, if we’re talking about the inactivated ones. The ones available in the US work nothing at all like traditional vaccines. That study is from before the variants. There is no 80%-90% reduction in infection anymore. And odds of dying from covid are not the same across age groups or health status.</p>

<p>That is absolutely untrue. There are vaccines such as those for smallpox or measles or HPV that confer sterilizing immunity, meaning that people vaccinated won’t get it or spread it. Every once in a while, for whatever reason, they fail to work in an extremely small amount for people, but for the vast majority, the give sterilizing immunity.</p>

        <p>MRNA is being pushed because Fauci and Big Pharma know it will usher in a new era of patent royalties.</p>
<p>MRNA couldn’t get past traditional pharma trials, usually failed in animal testing, so they used the pandemic as cover for pushing it through.</p>
<p>As you can see with the media coverage, the media gets most of their ad income from Big Pharma, the ridiculous level of reported negative side effects are being ignored and the vaccines are being hailed as a “miracle”.</p>
<p>Once these MRNA products get FDA approval they’ll start to try using this shit for all sorts of medical conditions.</p>
<p>The FDA is so corrupt they’ll approve the shit.</p>
<p>Inevitably down the road a ton of people will die or be injured by the MRNA meds that there’ll be long drawn out lawsuits etc. but that’s just the cost of doing business for Big Pharma.</p>
<p>They even budget for the lawsuits as “contingent liabilities”.</p>
<p>They budget for the deaths and injuries caused by their products.</p>

        <p>No it isn't. </p>
<p>It's a screenshot from the QCovid risk factor calculator that says at the top of every page in a big red box "This implementation of the QCovid risk calculator is NOT intended for use supporting or informing clinical decision-making." And if you'd actually read the screenshot you'd see that the model built for the calculator is based off of data from the first wave back in 2020.</p>
<p>AND even if neither of those things were true, what it actually says is that a given person, with a specific height, weight, age, gender, ethnicity, housing situation, zi pcode and with a specific set (or none) of medical issues, in a statistically perfect world would have x and y chance of death. In June of 2020. In the UK. In lockdown.</p>
<p>The conditions that existed then in Britain are not the same AT ALL to the ones the US are under now.</p>

        <p>did you not read anything I said?</p>
<p>It's a made up statistic from a TIME and PLACE that doesn't represent here and now.</p>
<p>It has no relation to reality.</p>
<p>And I don't know where you got it from, but if they/it told you it was CDC data, you should look critically at what else they tell you. Because it took me 10 seconds to google and maybe two minutes going through the QCovid page to figure out what that screenshot means. Passing it off as CDC data, or implying that it has ANY relation to the US in the summer of 2021 is dishonest.</p>

        <p>Not sure you’re posting in good faith here. </p>
<p>You say there are dozens of traditional vaccines available (inactivated virus), yet you don’t list them so that those who are not ‘in the know’ can look at them for themselves. It’s also my understanding that these are also under EUA, have not completed clinical trials, and are being downplayed by media/pharma/govt etc. </p>
<p>One of the main points in this sub is that we (generalising here) don’t agree with mandatory medical interventions. Particularly those that are not thoroughly tested, generally ineffective, and (oh ya) completely unnecessary. </p>
<p>Even if we could agree that covid is the big bad wolf it’s been made out to be (it isn’t - ‘cases’ are ridiculously inflated, and therefore so are deaths), there are MULTIPLE treatments, interventions, and prevention methods that work, are safe, and are cheap as fuck. </p>
<p>So you actually wanna know why people aren’t begging for that shit? That could be why. Which I feel like you could have reasoned out had you actually spent time in this sub and educated yourself. And that’s why I cannot help but conclude that this is a shit post. </p>
<p>Thanks for wasting our time. :)</p>

        <p>Maybe I'm not posting in good faith. My entire purpose for coming here and asking the question that I did is to seek nuance in what is a often a heated debate, and perhaps that was an unrealistic goal.</p>
<p>Now, to the rest. My bare minimum requirement is that if you want to actually have any meaningful discussion, you should have at least a basic knowledge of the topic or how to look up basic things. I don't have to be 'in the know' to be able to spend 20 seconds looking up a list of currently available vaccines. And if I had instead said ''CoviVac' or 'Covaxin' you'd have to look it up anyway.</p>
<p>And while it's true that these old style vaccines have not completed clinical trials, that doesn't have the same implications compared to the state of mRNA technology.</p>
<p>The technology behind mRNA is new and untested, but inactivated virus vaccines are not. We have decades of experience with the technique, and have a much more robust understanding of the long term 'risks' associated with them. We have a much better knowledge of how production variations can effect safety and efficacy.</p>
<p>Now, if you're saying that the pandemic is a hoax, and covid is overblown, I've got nothing. ICU wings, ventilators etc aren't cheap as fuck. Americans are coming out of hospitals with 100 000 dollar medical bills. Anyone with an elderly relative in a care home in a major city has first hand experience with how covid burned through old folks. Covid is closely behind cancer as the third leading cause of death in the US over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>I mean, think about it. What is more likely: </p>
<p>A giant globe spanning conspiracy, consisting of countries whose interests are wildly divergent, who would love nothing more than to pull one over the other guy. Requiring the active collusion of tens of thousands of scientists, doctors, health authorities, universities. Requiring a level of discretion and... basic competence that we rarely see in our government, over TWO administrations that are rabidly opposed to each other. And for what purpose? The Russians aren't injecting THEIR people with Bill Gates' microchips. </p>
<p>Or, Covid is actually a danger, just like tons of other diseases, the existence which aren't in dispute. Pandemics have been with humanity for all of recorded history.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd believe in something that could reasonably exist before I'd believe in a government that could actually keep something like this secret.</p>

        <p>Oh you. </p>
<p>You say you’re seeking nuance, but you’re not. Your mind is closed. That’s your choice. </p>
<p>You can throw around words like ‘hoax’ and ‘conspiracy’ and ‘microchip’ but none of those strengthen your position as much as you think they do. Nor do they weaken mine. I guess maybe it makes you feel better? It just makes me sad for you.</p>

        <p>MY mind is closed?</p>
<p>I'll let you in on a little secret: although I came here convinced that this sub was only full of conspiracy nutjobs who've gone off the deep end, I can admit that you guys actually managed to shift my view on mRNA. Although my first shot was Moderna, and I'm not particularly concerned there's going to be long term effects, I recognize that the entire field of mRNA is still new. And since I'm lucky enough to live somewhere where there's alternates available, I'll try and get an AZ for my second dose.</p>
<p>But I haven't seen much that would indicate my initial impression of this sub was wrong. And this is a huge problem, because there are lots of specific aspects of our national (and international) response to covid that can and should raise serious questions. Was the decision to use novel vaccine techniques to save time vs more proven technologies the right call? Should the CDC have made the decision to obfuscate about masks in order to prevent a shortage a good idea? Who decides what businesses should be restricted during a lockdown? How much economic pain caused by restrictions is a single life worth?</p>
<p>Personally, I believe lockdowns CAN BE an effective tool to slow transmission. This isn't really in dispute, any cursory comparison between case rates and lockdown restrictions pretty clearly show correlation. However, I also believe that there's a discussion to be had about what restrictions are more and less effective. Is closing golf courses, where patrons are naturally distanced, really the same as a public pool or a basketball court? At what point do the costs to workers become higher than the value we get out shutting a place down?</p>
<p>But it seems there's no middle ground to be found here. You are either pro-mask, pro-lockdown, pro-vax, pro-covid, pro-fauci, or you're against all those things. mRNA is unsafe AND other vaccines aren't safe AND vaccines don't work AND covid cases are overblown AND variants aren't real AND healthy people shouldnt get jabbed because they're not at risk AND covid isnt nearly as deadly as everyone makes it out to be.</p>
<p>Do you see I'm getting at?</p>

        <p>Valneva is coming next year, targeting 2022 Q1.
The UK has already bought some doses, I'm sure other countries did as well.</p>
<p>I don't support it, because it's still basically free money for big pharma for something most people don't need, but if the vaccine will become mandatory, Valneva sounds like the lesser evil.</p>

        <p>We don't take vaccines because we need them, we take them to protect the ones who can't get them. I personally am not concerned in the slightest about catching covid and getting sick, but not only do I have people in my life that ARE it risk, but there is everyone elses parents, kids, husbands etc.</p>
