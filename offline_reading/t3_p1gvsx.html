    <strong>Something almost everyone forgot - they called this "New Normal" WAYYY too early. Suspicious?</strong>
    <p><p>I've seen plenty of great posts here but I want to make sure no one forgets this. Think back to as early as <strong>March and April 2020</strong>, they were already excited to reference this as the "New Normal". They didn't even make it seem believable by waiting a few months where the situation seemed "bleak", and then say "this might unfortunately be the new normal", no, instead they said it WAY too early, as if they couldn't wait. This should've been a big clue something was wrong. I had my suspicions even as early as then.</p>
<p><strong>March 11, 2020</strong> was when it was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health organization, so it wasn't even a couple weeks when they started hammering "New Normal" down our throats?</p>
<p>I'm seeing people on other subs, complaining about how they've already been vaccinated and yet the politicians still impose restrictions on their lives, but the question they should be asking is NOT "when will the pandemic end", because of course all pandemics end, but rather the better question is "when will the government stop their security theater", and THAT is exactly the problem, because if we compare this to the previous crisis, 9/11, the war on terror has lasted nearly 20 years. So.... that is the actual root of the problem here.</p>
<p>This is why I can't take these posts seriously when they complain and say "I got the vaccine so why can't we get back to pre-pandemic life" like... come on, they wouldn't work so hard on the propaganda to just throw it all away that easily now, would they?</p></p>

        <p>Exactly it was like an instant switch from the old world to the new world on March 2020, just like how it was a drastic change between September 10, 2001 and September 12, 2001, to which some people describe as "radically different" worlds.</p>
<p>The creepy part is how <em>quickly</em> it was...</p>

        <p>Yep. Our government went from denying corona was any sort of a problem, to severe lockdowns, and immediately started calling it The New Normal.   </p>
<p>Anecdote: in July 2020, I already saw posters around here saying "Why go back to the old normal when it was causing the problems in the first place?" Always thought that was insane and eerie.</p>

        <p>For your anecdote... damn that's quite interesting. Though are you sure those were actually "real people" and not bots? Because the bots revealing themselves was especially apparent after the November 2020 presidential election, and the delta variant scare after Boris Johnson lifted restrictions July 19th, but it's not a stretch that they could've been doing that months before to stroke fear and push a certain narrative...</p>
