    <strong>More lockdowns. Isn't the timing interesting?</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not referring to the health Grinches taking away Christmas, either.</p>
<p>In my country at least, free Corona money is supposed to go away soon - or at least be more difficult and convoluted to get. The present payola was $2000 Canadian a month. And we are already seeing the lockdowns ramping up again, which means more people out of work.</p>
<p>If you want to destroy the economy and eliminate the middle class, this is the way to do it:</p>
<p>- Keep everyone hanging on by their fingernails. Give them false hope that "just a <em>little</em> more effort and sacrifice, and it will all be over". This has been the narrative for months now.</p>
<p>- Allow everyone to exhaust their RRSPs, burn their savings, fill up their credit cards, and call in every marker with family, friends etc, until there are none left.</p>
<p>- Allow everyone to run out of extensions and deferrals from banks, mortgage companies, credit card companies etc so they are a missed pay away from repossession/default.</p>
<p>- Drop the lockdown hammer again, and shut everything down (like is happening now), and sit back and watch the (former) middle class lose everything. They can't hold on on 2 grand a month.</p>
<p>- You now have massively expanded your pool of propertyless, assetless serfs. No more pesky middle class!</p>
<p>- Scoop up the repo'ed assets for pennies on the dollar, and profit. I'm sure the Chinese will buy.</p>
<p>The timing of the new waves of lockdowns isn't a coincidence...</p></p>

        <p>That's exactly what's happening and the terrifying thing is you'll be removed from r/Conspiracy very fast for connecting those dots in ways that don't include aliens, a fake asteroid psy-op, or Trump morphing into a lizard and taking our souls to the moon for harvesting.</p>
<p>It's not a coincidence people are made very, very ignorant of basic economics so they can't see the shell game that's happening right the fuck now.</p>

        <p>It's been a lot longer than months. They've been gatekeeping for quite some time. There's a lot of pseudo conspiracists that don't give a rats ass about  the TRUTH. They actively guard against any relevant information, downvote it to oblivion, censor it, and there's a lot of accounts that comment and complain "I just came here to read about reptilians and aliens and shit". In other words they don't give a damn about the truth, they just want to be entertained. As a "conspiracy" reddit, it's amazing the amount of conspiracies that get put to shame, I've watched countless time people get attacked and mocked because the conspiracy they posted about is "stupid". </p>
<p>I'll have to check out r/GoldandBlack thanks.</p>

        <p>You're spot on. MOST just want entertainment, whether that's the news/media/hollywood, or distractor conspiracy theory. People such as Alex Jones and David Icke are allowed to proliferate their information precisely because they don't connect the dots to the bigger picture, and their followers are kept forever at arms reach from actual big picture truth and understanding.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. Which, don't get me wrong, both of those guys put out SOME very good information. But you have to be very careful of them both. As it happens I've never been a fan of either, there's a reason they have the kind of platforms that they do. Even though they, and others like them, put out some good information, there's a lot of misleading information as well. Whether from human error or because they're paid shills, OR a little of both, who can say, but everyone is susceptible to error. </p>
<p>The biggest problem with Alex Jones and David Icke types that I see, you can throw Joe Rogan into the mix as well, is that they develop large cult followings who parrot anything they say like gospel. It gets to the point, if they say it's stupid, it must be stupid. If they say it's right, it must be right. In the end, it breaks people's critical thinking skills, the same critical thinking skills they were trying to regain by investigating conspiracies.</p>
<p>Knowledge without wisdom is a very dangerous thing. It is very easy to gain knowled without understand and I pray God continuously for wisdom and understanding. Which is also dangerous. As King Soloman puts in in Ecclesiastes 1:17 “And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow." This I've found to be exceedingly true. And the reason many people have found themselves derailed from their pursuit of knowledge and truth. And yet.. "Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.  For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it." Proverbs 8:10-11 </p>
<p>Ultimately we are all susceptible to error. It behooves us to watch over our own selves like hawks, reproving ourselves and guarding ourselves against pride, to stay humble and teachable, to receive wisdom and instruction.</p>

        <p>I've been saying for a fucking long time now that these lockdowns are only being done so that it'll destroy our economies.</p>
<p>The truth is that the western world is full of fucking traitors that don't give a damn about us. You don't see rampant lockdowns happening in China. They only did that in Wuhan for like a little while at first, and now the peoples of Wuhan are having FUCKING POOL PARTIES:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot4LwLDiRHE China had like fucking one lockdown and that was it, yet you'll never see these assholes bring that up or even publicly question how China got rid of the virus.</p>
<p>I know some people here will think that this is being done because our governments are stupid, but they HAVE to know what they are doing. They know that they're nuking our economy. What they're doing is beyond fucking evil, and I mean it. You can't even fuck up the economy this hard and fast in wartime, just look at Britain in WW2, they got their cities bombed by the Germans and their economy didn't get rocked as hard as it is now. What's worse is that due to all of the dumbass doomers, they get to do this all the while blaming Corona for it.</p>

        <p>You are right. They're not stupid and they're not incompetent.</p>
<p>Stupid people don't rise to the top of state power and have more money, wealth, and power than most of us will ever dream of.</p>
<p>People who fail upward with "mistakes" that increase their money, power, and wealth are not "incompetent."</p>
<p>It is painful for me to hear people say that, and call you a "conspiracy theorist" if you suggest otherwise.</p>
