        <p>yeah I have a family friend who died in a car accident and wasn't even positive for COVID, but was known to be exposed to COVID, who was categorized as a COVID death. Another resident in the nursing home I work at, who died a gradual death from cancer, who was classified as a COVID death merely because she was presumed to have been exposed to COVID, even though there was no known COVID in the facility. I keep hearing personal stories like this from different people in my life too. Not exactly surprising when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/coronavirus/Alert-2-New-ICD-code-introduced-for-COVID-19-deaths.pdf">the national policy is literally to classify all assumed COVID deaths as definite COVID on death certificates</a></p>

Over 4.64 million world wide and you find the one guy who had a heart attack just after (who was 75 years old and was probably due something like a heart attack anyway soon) and decide that's evidence that the vaccine is dangerous.

        <p>490000, that is the same number children, that the gates polio vaccination campaign in india paralyzed:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf</a> </p>
<p>&rt; A total of 640,000 children developed NPAFP in the years 2000–2017, suggesting that there were an additional 491,000 paralyzed children above our expected numbers for children with NPAFP. </p>
<p>just interesting to mention, as the numbers are basically the same.</p>
<p>how many children will the covid-19 poison injections paralyze for life or temporary? who knows....</p>
<p>also if you want to make a proper argument, then you would need to point out, that vaccine injury tracking systems have been deliberately garbage for decades now. not my opinion, but the result of this investigation:</p>
<p><a href="https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf">https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Likewise, fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events are reported. </p>
<p>and you should also point out, that NONE of the claimed covid-19 "vaccines" went through longterm RCTs, which are required to establish reasonable safety of any medication.</p>
<p>so when you see a person dying 2 hours after getting an experimental injection the senseful reaction would be to question safety massively and as there is no safety data and the injection being experimental, to of course demand a stop of this experiment and do proper studies to make sure, that heart attacks, auto immune diseases, sterility, cancer, ASD and more are not linked to the new vaccines.</p>
<p>your response of:</p>
<p>"fuck it, that must be a coincidence, so let's keep this experiment going" is frankly insanity.</p>
<p>there have already been reports of bell's palsy (face paralysis)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9030943/Four-volunteers-got-Pfizers-vaccine-developed-Bells-palsy.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9030943/Four-volunteers-got-Pfizers-vaccine-developed-Bells-palsy.html</a>  and anaphylactic shocks:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9064399/A-SECOND-Alaska-healthcare-worker-allergic-reaction-Pfizers-coronavirus-vaccine.html">https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-9064399/A-SECOND-Alaska-healthcare-worker-allergic-reaction-Pfizers-coronavirus-vaccine.html</a> </p>
<p>the difference is of course, that no claim can be made, that those just randomly happened, which is why they are accepted as effects from the vaccines already.</p>

        <p>All vaccines have potential dangers. But when benefits outweigh risks it is given a green light. What's worse. A small percentage of paralyzed kids or a worldwide polio pandemic.</p>
<p>I know morally no one wants anyone to get seriously ill because they took a vaccine but morally no one wants the world to die from an infection/virus that was avoidable. </p>
<p>I don't even like saying it because it's like I am condemning people to die. But I know that really it's the better choice of the two shit choices.</p>
<p>No these vaccines haven't been tested for as long but they have had more teams working on them, more money pumped in and there have been trials and now that it's being given to everyone we are finding a fairly normal rate of people's bodies reacting poorly to it. We don't even know if the side effects are temporary or not. </p>
<p>You are doing what you claim they are doing by jumping to conclusions before the results are in.</p>

<p>because i actually do have lots of evidence showing harm from vaccines and showing complete vaccine failure too btw.....</p>
<p>here we got the DTP vaccination killing children. this data includes all potential benefit, that the vaccine might provide, because it looks at whether they die or not:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360569/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5360569/</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Among 3–5-month-old children, having received DTP (± OPV) was associated with a mortality hazard ratio (HR) of 5.00 (95% CI 1.53–16.3) compared with not-yet-DTP-vaccinated children. </p>
<p>acellular pertussis NOT preventing infection, but reducing some symptoms, this then can result  in much more spread and shows a COMPLETE VACCINE FAILURE!</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24277828/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24277828/</a> </p>
<p>&rt; The observation that aP, which induces an immune response mismatched to that induced by natural infection, fails to prevent colonization or transmission provides a plausible explanation for the resurgence of pertussis and suggests that optimal control of pertussis will require the development of improved vaccines. </p>

<p>vaccinated children being VASTLY sicker than fully unvaccinated children in regards to allergies, learning disabilities, allergic rhinitis and more:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U-S-children.php#Article">https://www.oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U-S-children.php#Article</a> </p>
<p>children vaccinated within 1 year of life vs those who do not get vaccinated in the first year of life are vastly sicker:</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2050312120925344">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2050312120925344</a> </p>
<p>&rt; Vaccination before 1 year of age was associated with increased odds of developmental delays (OR = 2.18, 95% CI 1.47–3.24), asthma (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 2.04–9.88) and ear infections (OR = 2.13, 95% CI 1.63–2.78).  </p>
<p>and as you seemingly do NOT understand what polio really was/is please watch this referenced presentation on it:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Twch-T-n8Ns</a> </p>
<p>and to focus on this study again:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6121585/pdf/ijerph-15-01755.pdf</a></p>
<p>&rt;A total of 640,000 children developed NPAFP in the years 2000–2017, suggesting that there were an additional 491,000 paralyzed children above our expected numbers for children with NPAFP.</p>
<p>it is important to know, that the polio definition changed, when the vaccines got introduced to fake the effectiveness of the vaccines. suddenly the rates were dropping, because you needed to stay paralyzed for much longer and the diagnosis was much harder to meet.</p>
<p>if one would actually use the original polio diagnosis, then one could rightfully say, that the polio vaccination campaign from india caused 490000 cases of polio!</p>
<p>i would HIGHLY suggest, that you don't random assume effectiveness or safety for untested products, that never went through proper safety studies.</p>
<p>and in regards to the fake studies for the covid-19 "vaccines" you can look at this video:</p>
<p><a href="https://thehighwire.com/videos/a-vaccine-on-the-horizon/">https://thehighwire.com/videos/a-vaccine-on-the-horizon/</a>  from minute 10-30.</p>
<p>quite a scam. all bullshit nonsense.</p>
<p>please remove your blind trust into random injections from pharma or governments. historically they can not be trusted and i provided you with tons of evidence for harm of those injections including deaths as well as them being ineffective.</p>
<p>this is the real data. read the research.</p>
<p>peer reviewed research stands way way WAY above any statements by governments, the FDA, CDC or WHO.</p>

        <p>Tell you what I will read it. When I get time today I will read your sources, the articles and then I will attempt to assess the validity of each of the sources through my own research. </p>
<p>Just looking through quickly it would seem that you are citing failures in vaccines from the past that have all since been improved upon. But I will need to read it properly first.</p>
<p>I don't know what I will believe at the end but I doubt you can convince me that vaccines are worse than not. </p>
<p>If I draw the same conclusions as you, then fine.</p>

        <p>&rt;failures in vaccines from the past that have all since been improved upon.</p>
<p>pertussis and acellular pertussis vaccines are still used today widely, if you are refering to those cases. (DTP vaccine contains pertussis component, DTaP contains acellular pertussis componound).</p>
<p>i have seen no improvement at all and more and more vaccines are getting added to government suggested/mandated vaccine schedules.</p>
<p>if you want to see an example of unicef for example ignoring the research, then you can read this exchange:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.icandecide.org/ican-vs-unicef/">https://www.icandecide.org/ican-vs-unicef/</a> </p>
<p>where ican (informed consent action network)  gives a notice to unicef about the research and harm from the DTP vaccination campaigns. it basically got completely ignored.</p>
<p>&rt; I don't know what I will believe at the end but I doubt you can convince me that vaccines are worse than not. </p>
<p>i suggest, that you look at the evidence with an open mind.</p>
<p>have you actually read some peer reviewed studies showing how safe vaccines are? or how effective the vaccines are? (refering to overall health improvement here not often worthless "antibody" level testing "studies")</p>
<p>you are clearly already trying to approach the subject with a decently open mind and actually are going to read the research. to that alone i say thank you and i appreciate it. :)</p>
