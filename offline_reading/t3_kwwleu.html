    <strong>Hi everyone.</strong>
    <p><p>I’m going to start off by saying, I followed this subreddit for a meme. I thought you all were nutcases who were trying to rationalize not following the rules. I was wrong. Every single day I find a post on here that pulls me further and further away from trusting or believing what’s going on. I don’t want to kill anybody, and I know none of you do too. That being said, the “rules” have gone above and beyond what would be reasonable for a society. I live in Ohio and we have a 10pm curfew. WHY? What does that do other than keep businesses who make money late into the night from operating because they aren’t a 24/7 fast food chain. I work at a snowboarding resort, a lot of money is made during the weekend for late nights. Why is covid stopping a business that NATURALLY HAS MOST PEOPLE WEARING MASKS DUE TO WEATHER from operating past 10pm. You guys have opened my eyes. Unfortunately I will follow the rules of small businesses and school when I need to, but it’s only because the small businesses are “required”</p>
<p>Thank you for hearing my rant. Unfortunately I don’t feel like we are close to the end, but keep doing what you are doing. People’s eyes will start opening.</p></p>

        <p>Welcome. My personal opinion is that the virus is real,  but the reaction to it is both unjust and overblown. I'm all for allowing people to take steps to protect themselves, especially those who are in the demographics that are in real danger from this.</p>

        <p>that's one of their general propaganda techniques, it's called poisoning the well. They take reasonable skepticism and conflate it with extreme people like alex jones etc. and ridiculous conspiracy theories like the flat earth. That way when normies first start to question, the first thing they'll run into is a bunch of flat earth people pushing the thing that they're questioning, and they will think "ew, i'm not one of *those* people" and it will scare them away.</p>
<p>I've literally been ridiculed as a "flat-earth conspiracy theorist" by normies when i have expressed skepticism in the official narrative so this technique clearly works.</p>

        <p>I wouldn't go so far as to say it's not real, but I am skeptical of it. Before you downvote, I hope I can explain a bit because the case might just be I'm uneducated when it comes to how other illness is treated. Specifically with regards to how the CDC counts ANY death with Covid as a Covid death even if there are other morbidity factors. Is that the same case with other illness? If someone dies with the flu, is it a flu death? Maybe, but I don't know. Isn't it a little strange that the flu has disappeared at the same time Covid arrived?</p>
<p>There's still too many weird things going around Covid for me to rule out something else more sinister at play.</p>

        <p>There’s probably more moving parts to this whole thing than we will ever understand — a tangled web of good people with the wrong information, bad people fighting for power/wealth, and a naive and easily swayed populace. </p>
<p>COVID is real — science shows that (I’m intentionally avoiding “the science” because that’s a blatant contradiction in terms). It’s also not that dangerous — science shows that, too, when you actually look at the numbers and not the headlines.</p>
<p>All of this is just a natural progression of modern society. Science predicted a virus around this time, and because many people naturally latch on to doomsday predictions to find purpose, the COVID overreaction was inevitable. If not this disease, then another one in a few years.</p>
<p>Honestly, I could make a whole post (or several) about this.</p>

        <p>Yes good point I'm screaming these questions. also any ct over 23 shows a positive "non infectious" case. Which means nothing really, you can't pass it on.
People aren't being given their ct with the results.
Ct of 30 to 45 is just false positives.
The whole pandemic is based on false positives.
Thats why the media only talk "infection rate" and not "mortality rate"</p>

        <p>Someone correct me if im wrong, but if i recall correctly this is roughly how a nurse friend of mine explained it to me. When someone dies a report is filed, and in that report are codes for anything and everything on his/her medical chart. Man dies in car crash, probably several codes for broken bones, internal bleeding etc. hes also diabetic so theres a code for that. Cause of death is trauma due to the impact, but the diabetes code is still there. Same thing with COVID, except hospitals are incentivized to report COVID deaths. They get funding based on the number of COVID cases and deaths they report, which is especially critical right now because theyre having to cancel "elective procedures" which is where the majority of their revenue comes from.</p>
<p>Im in the same boat as you. I believe its real (ive had it) but its been way overplayed in the media, and i truly dont know why, other than people pushed back and uncle sam didnt like being told "no" so hes throwing a temper tantrum</p>

There are a lot of people who trust the news implicitly believe anything the news says.   Then there are people who dont pay attention, who do support the president, who now think he said it and believe it to be true.   Boom, youve just turned your lies into a weapon.</p>
<p>Lies make their way around the world before the truth has a chance to put its pants on.</p>

        <p>I personally think the virus WAS real, but that naturally it will come and go just like any other version the coronavirus aka flu. In the beginning China didn’t know how dangerous their lab made virus that escaped would be so they had harsh lockdowns and the WHO encouraged the rest of the world to do the same... they then realized this is a pretty weak virus that only effects people with certain conditions. But it was too late. They’ve already acted like it was deadly. They refuse to admit they were wrong and restore normal freedom.</p>

        <p>Look at the history of the news and their reporting on viruses. They do this every 2 years, just never this extreme. There’s a super meme floating around of the headlines going back to the year 2000 showing all the fear mongering over swine flu, H1N1, etc.</p>

        <p>It’s hard to understand as You would have to change your world view pretty drastically to understand that viruses do not actually cause disease.  it would indicate much deeper problems, in our whole system, which would have had to have been happening for a looong time.  But there are many problems with the science behind isolating, sequencing, and proving causation though.  Here is a good example:</p>

        <p>Hey, we appreciate you too!  There are a number of different people in this sub but it appears that most people think that we as a group, think that it’s all made up.  </p>
<p>They may have valid points but I always saw this group as being against the lockdown restrictions, since they ended up hurting mostly everyone across the board, and seeing the virus as being overblown.  That could also just be my personal take but I think a lot of people see us as people who stick their heads in the sand and deny what’s around them when we’re more-so questioning the effectiveness of the response done by our governments.</p>

<p>Not made up. Unleashed on purpose. Used as a way to control. Or to collapse. None of this happened organically, I think most of us agree at least with that. There is a virus, no doubt, but every other aspect is suspicious AF.</p>

        <p>Since AdWa11a didn't answer for many hours, I figured I'd share the obvious one with everybody.</p>
<p>The  CDC put out this paper about the PCR tests.  What this excerpt means exactly, despite what the *** media will claim, is that at the time all those test kits were made and put out, they DID NOT HAVE THE VIRUS isolated.   So instead they are testing for something totally different that maybe kind of sort of resembles the virus.</p>
<p>If you jump to page numbered 42 of this document from July, you will see </p>
<p><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/134922/download"><strong>Since no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV were available</strong> for CDC use at the time the test was developed 
and this study conducted, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA...</a></p>
<p>No newer version since July exists.  They are still using the same test.  The truly sham and hilarious part of this is that if they hadn't isolated the virus in the first place, how the hell could they test for it?  </p>
<p>Like, imagine somebody told you they lost their dog, and you have to help look for it.   When you ask them what the dog looks like, they tell you - well, it has fur.  It has four legs.  and it barks.   Go find it!!    </p>
<p>The other act of bullshit is when they put out these total death numbers by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm">mixing up all the pneumonia, influenza, and covid cases to obfuscate reality</a>.   Make no mistake, that first column is not "total deaths caused by covid",  this number includes people who died in car wrecks, drownings, and shootings but were tested positive at some point. </p>

        <p>Uh, no? I had it myself. Normal cold/flu symptoms, then lost all taste. A test confirmed it later.</p>
<p>It's definitely not worth giving up civil liberties for, but that doesn't mean it's a "complete sham."</p>

        <p>Doesn't congestion from a normal cold/flu make you loose your sense of taste as well?</p>
<p>Half of taste is being able to smell and if you're congested, you're not gonna taste much.</p>

None of us want covid to spread or people to die. But when the restrictions spread on and on for a year and start to do more harm than good that's when we need to start questioning it !</p>

        <p>you're awesome OP. Try not to make the intellectually lazy mistake of letting your views shift based on what types of people are advocating for them. There's a wide variety of people on both sides of this thing, and there's also ridiculous caricatures of both sides, depending on how much bullshit you swallow. Good information justifies itself, all by itself. If you're looking for it, you'll find it. Cheers homie</p>

        <p>Changing one's mind is a difficult and usually honest and virtuous thing to do.  Most people just double down on ideas that they've become emotionally attached to. 
When it comes to covid, even ignorance is not bliss but skepticism sure is beneficial to your sanity.</p>

        <p>I haven't been here from the beginning either. 
I was nervous when we got our first cases in the Netherlands. I had no idea what was coming and how bad it was. I thought our first lockdown in march for a couple of weeks was justified, to flatten the curve. I'm a nurse myself, although not in the hospital, but I know what it's like to work during a virus outbreak. I was scared for my clients and scared for my daughter. I read the most horrible things online.</p>
<p>But after a while I noticed it wasn't this big killer virus we expected. After our first lockdown everyone went on it's merry way, no mandated masks, no lockdown, everything was open, we didn't even wear masks at work with the elderly patients. </p>
<p>And guess what, nothing happened. Sure we lost a few patients to covid but we still lose patients every year to the flu or a heatwave. These people are old and frail, sadly it's a part of life. It ends one day. 
But the big wave of infections never happened. I don't have a steady job, I help out all across my province, over 50 different teams, hundreds of patients. We never had a lot of deaths, it simply did not happen.</p>
<p>I'm not saying this was all planned, I'm not saying bill gates is injecting microchips with his vaccine and I'm not saying the virus is not real or that people aren't getting sick/dying, I am saying it is overblown and it does not deserve fhe name 'pandemic'. It simply is not. It simply does not justify the lockdown of an entire country.</p>

        <p>What I personally have found the most effective for most of the people I talk to is emphasizing lockdown harms. The primary argument for lockdowns is that they save lives, but the simple truth is that they don't. And there are lots of verifiable links to reputable sources to back this up. Also, making people defend lockdowns from a trade off standpoint seems to be effective in at least making them think. </p>
<p>Another strategy I've found to be somewhat effective is putting the virus response in historical context. Millions of people died in the 20th century during flu pandemics (many when the world population was much smaller) and there were no lockdowns. Lockdowns are an unprecedented response. That also seems to get people thinking. </p>
<p>People will eventually come to this conclusion on their own (we can't live like this forever) and so my goal is to make that process a little bit quicker.</p>

        <p>For me this has been a safe place to openly question everything about how things are being handled.  I do believe there is a virus and I do believe that it can be lethal to some people - the more time passes we can see that statistically it is affecting the elderly and those with underlying conditions.  Occasionally we hear of someone who appeared “young and healthy” dying from it.  But you hear the same thing about other diseases and accidents.  None of us are invincible.  That being said, I feel the current measures are over-reaching for a virus that has a high survival rate for the majority of the population.  The current measures are causing far more harm than good.  I think it is selfish to think we can keep living like this.  I know the risks and I am ready to assume those risks.</p>
<p>There aren’t a lot of places where you can say anything that goes against the current narrative of “Stay Home! Save Lives!” otherwise you are quick to be labeled an anti-masker or grandma-killer.  I wear a mask because it’s mandated, I hate it, and I live for the day I don’t have to wear it anymore.</p>
<p>Anyways, welcome!</p>

        <p>First off, THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH, you guys have been way too kind for such a simple post lol. Secondly I’d like to say that I saw the post of the woman shaking after her vaccine and I will ABSOLUTELY NOT be getting the vaccine. I was considering getting it just because “why not” until the second I saw that video. I’m not antivax (though I have been pretty bad the last couple years getting my flu shot) but THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. It freaks me out and I want to tell everybody I can not to get that shit, that was horrifying. I hope you all are doing well! Be careful, but more importantly never stop being yourselves!</p>

        <p>I don't need a vaccine for covid, nor do I want one. My Grandma's friend got her second dose the other week and it made her really sick over the weekend, to the point of not eating for a few days. That worries me. Yes, you sometimes feel ill after a vaccine but that's quite serious. My mum's friend who works in healthcare got the first dose and then they said the had no second doses left and offered her a dose of a different vaccine instead. Mix and match your vaccines? No thanks. Considering that vaccines are usually in trials for over 10 years and this hasn't even managed one, I'll take my chances with my 99.8% chance of surviving covid rather than my unknown chance of developing serious effects from the vaccine that we simply can't know about thanks to a lack of trials. A lot of the time we're portrayed as anti vaxxers but for most, myself included, it's only this one for specific reasons.</p>

        <p>I think early on especially, a lot of people were willing to go along with it. Sort of felt like a snow day; you don't go to school, work, etc. And you get to sit at home and be comfy. Well that comfortability very quickly began to lose its charm when now if you don't wear a mask you can get verbally accosted by frankly zealots who will never question anything they are told. Good on you for coming around, welcome friend</p>

        <p>Thank you for your post. I always find it very uplifting when not only when people come to our side, but also just see that we're not some brainless, inhumane psychos recklessly advocating against "the science" because we don't care or are selfish. If anything, we care too much for people to allow these overreaching restrictions to continue to happen to them. </p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that I'm very vocal against all restrictions while still following all of them - so please don't feel bad. I feel we all do what we can in any way we can. Even if it's just making uplifting posts like yours.</p>

r/lockdownskepticism more. I find it more rational, and theres more sharing of scientific data. This reddit is more fun though :p</p>

<p>this is only tangentially related but I found it interesting how the osu medical center that announced a new strain is named after les wexner, epstein's patron and ostensible mossad handler in the united states according to whitney webb. as a fellow midwesterner I just thought you might get a kick out of that "coincidence" OP, especially given epstein and the gang's interests in technocracy and transhumanism</p>
