        <p>And we became sheep. IMO, it'll be a some sort of turning point if we allow mandatory vaccination and passport for virus like covid. If it happens to adult, it's gonna easily happen to kids. There are no reasons to do the same against flu as well.</p>
<p>I respect people like her standing up against governments, but I think the only realistic path for the  freedom is to abandon the society and live off-grid. It is a kind of era when your opinions differ from the majority, your life becomes stressful.</p>

        <p>IMO, most people can't. That kind of freedom comes with great cost.</p>

        <p>I'd say the only cost is community. Which is the greatest cost to the individual. It's ironic that the very system that literally revolves around promoting materialistic individualism as living the 'dream' aka the reward for only focusing on what betters one's own life at the cost of the whole of humanity. </p>
<p>All this Virtue signaling and finger pointing shows that people just want to believe whatever they have to to better their idea idea of reality. We no longer know what's best for us as a whole because we are a fractured consciousness. Projecting our subconscious guilt on those we think are responsible is just another by product of our inability to understand one another of this disconnection. </p>
<p>I don't know when it happened, but there is mounding evidence that humanity had all but perfected most of the broken systems we have in place today. It seems like we only get half (some would even argue it's a negligible amount) of the story when it comes our history as a species. </p>
<p>Our current accepted written history starts with individuals deeming themselves more important than the whole of humanity. We jumped from a thriving species composed of diverse interconnected communities that made decisions to protect one another from outside threats, to a species that threatens its existence now protecting itself from itself.  </p>
<p>If you understand the scale of the earth and its life giving resources than you understand that the idea of 
any human suffering being necessary for self preservation is a concept created by an individualistic thought process. War is a concept created by an individualistic thought process. Currency is a concept created by an individualistic thought process. Government is a concept created by an individualistic thought process. All fundamental mechanisms of the system, that we have been told preserves our species, simultaneously prevents our species from thriving.</p>

        <p>Oh, I was playing it on Reddit, but yeah, I see that it shows up when I open it in YouTube.  thanks.  Crazy.  This whole situation is crazy!!  Well, whoever is behind this should be scared for their souls.  Literally.  There's something scarier than what they're doing to people.  If this is true, then these people are blind pawns of the devil.</p>
