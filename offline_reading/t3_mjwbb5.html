    <strong>Only reason why the world is taking this long to got back to normal is</strong>
    <p><p>because of people like you. Had everyone just chilled in their house for 3 weeks we would not be here with 2.84m dead but no, youre time and life is worth so much more than others. Funny thing is I'll be banned as a troll and you won't even see the irony of what you're doing. You use the same controlling techniques as China (an actual tryanical government btw) dismiss, spread misinformation &amp; remove anyone that disagrees with what you say and these actions come from the same place. Greed &amp; Selfishness.</p></p>

        <p>Is that why in all the places where everyone literally stayed home for 3 weeks they are still having lockdowns one year down the road? </p>
<p>You’d have to be extremely dull to think a virus would « go way » if everyone stayed home for a couple weeks.</p>

        <p>The only place that people actually followed full lockdown procedures is new zealand and guess what, they were covid free twice!! now imagine everyone just stopped and asked is it such a bad thing to chill in my house for 2 weeks? Where I am people pretend to follow the simplest rules like wearing a mask properly or not going to house parties. Those people are the reason we still have to put up with lockdowns. They party, we have to stay home and away from family.</p>

        <p>We shouldn’t ban this user - everyone needs a reminder of what we are up against and how emotionally driven all these Doomers are every single day. </p>
<p>You’re orgasming over the fear porn and the thought of telling people to mask up because you have no control over your own life or self and need to feel like you have some semblance of power. </p>
<p>Take the power back. Do some research and think instead of believing what you’re told by people that don’t care about you and only want to control you and everyone you know. </p>

        <p>I'm not a doomer, I don't think this is the end of humanity I am just disappointed that people can be so stubborn for something so dumb. If youre not worried about having covid then why wont you wear a mask so someone else wont catch it? Is that such a hard thing to ask for? Do you drink and drive?</p>

        <p>As an answer to the comment you deleted: “Oh you don’t say, the only place in earth that your strategy works in is an isolated sparsely populated   island country which by the way just lifted it’s 3rd lockdown of Auckland ? .....and that’s just during the southern summer !</p>
<p>Do you even have any idea just how arrogent, condescending and egotistical you sound ? Just stay home for a few weeks? And what, get delivered your every whim by the worker class?</p>
<p>Where I live I need a QR code from the government to leave my home, restaurants have been closed for the past 6 months with no end in site and you can’t buy baby clothes because they are “not essential”, meanwhile the police are brutalizing people for not wearing masks or assembling at church..... All of this after a month of literally everyone staying home.</p>
<p>The reason you have to put up with the lockdowns is not because of other people going about their lives, it is because your a compliant serf who doesn’t see an issue with the gestapo psychopaths imposing and enforcing this totalitarian wet dream.”</p>
