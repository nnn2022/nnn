    <strong>Missed Cancer Screenings</strong>
    <p><p>This is obviously a real problem, but is it really attributable to government mitigation mandates? Isn't it more of a direct consequence of  hospitals and clinics being overwhelmed with COVID cases, and enforcing  their own safety measures? Have governments actually required medical facilities to routine halt cancer screenings at any point during the pandemic?</p></p>

        <p>Overwhelmed with cases? They shut down the field hospitals and mercy ship without a single patient. All paid for with our taxes.</p>

        <p>Just because they may have gone overboard with the field hospitals doesn't mean that hospitals were never overwhelmed...</p>
<p>Anyway, that's irrelevant to my question. I'm just wondering if anyone can point to a specific cause-and-effect relationship between government mitigation mandates and missed cancer screenings.</p>

        <p>I'm not discounting the possibility that the medical facilities' own policies are at fault, just questioning the assertion I've seen that that government mandates are specifically responsible for missed cancer screenings.</p>

        <p>Not one hospital was overwhelmed by COVID. On the contrary, they had so little work due to lockdown that they were going broke. What's a good way to stem those losses? Luckily, they can claim substantial government money if they claim deaths with COVID.</p>
<p>There are two aspects to this problem. First, the government prohibited elective procedures. Elective just means you are not in an immediate emergency. If you're not dying, come back when you are. Second, people were so terrified that they were preferring to stay at home while they were collapsing than risk going to the hospitals.</p>
<p>I can't say I entirely blame people for putting off going to the doctor for routine screenings if they're not actually sick because I wouldn't want to deal with the security theater, and I sure as hell wouldn't want a fake COVID diagnosis.</p>

        <p>I can only speak from about Sweden and the hospital I work at.
Between mars-october 2020 there were 9000 less cancer diagnoses in Sweden compared to normal year. That is around 9% drop. 
Obviously people are not getting less cancer so now there are a lot of people walking around with undiagnosed cancer. </p>
<p>I live and work in a hospital in southern sweden. In early 2020 the pandemic didn't really hit us at all. Despite this many outpatient receptions were closed and many elective screenings where postponed.  Because of the histeria people also avoided seeing their doctor for non-emergencies.
For example I met a guy at the ER that had been bleeding from his rectum for weeks but was to afraid to go to the doctor and his blood levels were extremely low.</p>
<p>The pandemic then hit us pretty hard in the end of 2020 and our hospital was pretty much full. But covid patient don't require so much diagnostics. We don't do many x-rays(maybe just normal chest xrays) on them or other interventions. They usually "just" require medical treatment and oxygen. So even though hospitals are overwhelmed with covid patient it shouldn't really trouble other parts of health care all that much, like cancer screenings.</p>
<p>So I believe those missed cancer screenings are mostly because of the histeria and less because of the patient flow.</p>
