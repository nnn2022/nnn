        <p>What destroyed the country was people getting fat and lazy.  Then, the drug companies offered pills to keep them alive, which is easier than a healthy lifestyle.  Sure, it's bad, but the drugs aren't the problem.  They're inanimate chemicals.  They can help a lot of sick people who can't be aided by diet and exercise alone.  Antibiotics for one have saved countless lives.</p>
