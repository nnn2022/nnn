    <strong>Activism idea</strong>
    <p><p>Very simple concept.</p>
<p>We as community choose sources that are credible, factional, shocking, revealing and overall something that might speak to our sleeping brothers.
We target covid based communities by posting the said articles, links, memes etc. on their subs.
There a people still undecided about all of this Plandemic ™️ , even few who wood decide to look into the truth would discover inconsistencies and overall absurdity of how this is being handled.
If we could inform as many people as we can that would be a great group effort.
I’m not sure if that would be against Reddit rules ,but I’m sure there is a way around it.
Please share your ideas based on spreading information , i feel it’s time to do something about this as a group, as a whole.
Thank you.</p></p>

        <p>Anything unique would be hard for the AI to detect and block, and memes are a good format as that's what most people manage to take in before they get bored and stop reading. People today are too lazy to read articles or full scientific reports, especially if it goes against their agenda.</p>
<p>I therefore suggest we stick to memes, unique memes, and particularity of the type that makes people think and use common sense. Like carefully and indirectly questioning stuff that makes no sense in all the restrictions, but with plenty of variation, because some of these memes they've already been programmed to respond "deboonked" to, and if that idea is triggered they won't change their mind.</p>
<p>Sweden is also a good example to use. No lockdowns, no mask enforcement, but cold and very vulnerable to flu and flu like viruses, still fewer deaths than the UK and many other places that gone full fascist. It's also transparent, and all data is publicly available so it's hard for them to deny any stats.</p>
