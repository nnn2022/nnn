    <strong>The NHS in the UK have started the process to forced the vaccine. Are there unions to represent people that don’t want it?</strong>
    <p><p>Received an email today (this is the opening, but it is MUCH longer:</p>
<p>*IMPORTANT – COVID-19 vaccination</p>
<p>We’re writing this letter to update you on a change of policy at ‘xxxxx’ relating to staff uptake of the COVID-19 vaccination.</p>
<p>We have recently contacted all ‘xxxxxxx’ staff where we hold no record of vaccination, to identify their vaccination status for SARS-COV-2 (COVID 19), and we understand that you have chosen not to receive the vaccine at this time.</p>
<p>Our priority is to keep our staff and patients safe and having reviewed all the evidence and consulted with our colleagues from infection prevention, occupational health and human resources we have agreed that going forward only those that have received a COVID vaccination will be able to work in patient facing roles.</p>
<p>From today we will be conducting new individual risk assessments for staff and all new starters that have chosen not to have the vaccine. If necessary, we will then be supporting these staff to work in alternative areas within the NHS that are not patient facing, and therefore lower risk.</p>
<p>Your manager will shortly be contacting you to check that you have received this letter and to discuss next steps.*</p>
<p>What would you do?</p>
<p>I am not a low level staff member here. This is my career for over a decade.  The face to face ‘interrogations’ about it start from today.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>Part of me is thinking of going off sick immediately before they can ambush me so I can make a plan.</p></p>

        <p>Certainly talk to a solicitor, one you know who is sympathetic. But running from the problem won’t help. Just say no.</p>

        <p>Careful taking "sick" time. Being "unvaxxed" and then telling them you are "sick" may lead to a pretty bad outcome.</p>

        <p>I think taking sick leave and consulting a lawyer is a good idea. Also consult a union ? Join up with likeminded people in your organisation and discuss a collective stance. Don t talk to them about anything.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty well versed in communication and psychology and thus would just see how those "face to face interrogations" go.</p>
<p>A few tips for that:</p>
<p>Paraphrase/interpret everything you are being told/asked to make sure that there's no misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Formulate a "whole message" when answering. A whole message consists of observation, thoughts, feelings and conclusion where you make sure to separate what is what so your observations don't get mixed up with your thoughts.</p>
<p>Be as open and as honest as possible.</p>
<p>I don't know what exactly is your reason for not wanting it. Mine is: "I'm afraid of side-effects. The reason for that is that I don't trust the people who are promoting the vaccines. The reason for my distrust is that I noticed massive contradictions in what they claim is going on and my own perception of what is going on."</p>
