    <strong>My resignation letter in the event my workplace mandates vaccines for all employees</strong>
    <p><p>[Redacted] Human Resources,</p>
<p>Your decision to mandate the Coronavirus vaccine is regretful and unfortunate. People should have the freedom to decide for themselves what they put into their bodies, without fear of losing their jobs or livelihood. We live in unprecedented times where more and more control over people is being asserted by the Government, and I will not be a part of a company that chooses to bend to their will over protecting the rights of their employees.</p>
<p>There are many people who are allergic to the vaccine and many others that have had adverse reactions, even death. It is not FDA approved as of now and forcing people to take it is not only unethical, it is very dangerous. I may or may not be vaccinated myself – but it is no one’s business but mine and my doctor’s. I will not disclose personal medical information to those who do not need to know it.</p>
<p>I disagree with the mask policy implemented in the beginning of the pandemic, but I can deal with it. Masks can be taken off at the end of the shift but the vaccine is permanent. Not only this, but after six months the vaccinated are considered unvaccinated again and have to keep up on their “Covid boosters”. Either way it is a perpetual cycle of endless shots to keep up with, or be subject to termination. This is the environment you have created by mandating the vaccine as a condition of employment. It is wrong, it is unnecessary, and you will lose many employees and business because of this decision.</p>
<p>I started as a temporary employee in October 2020 and was hired seven months later on May 10. I was hoping to stay on long term due to the friendly atmosphere and good working environment, but I had a line, and this new policy crosses it. I am hereby resigning my position at [Redacted] effective immediately.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>[real name]</p></p>

        <p>They will deny you unemployment it seems.  Link below in the other comment.  I have another coworker who feels the same as you and says they'll have to fire him, but ethically I would feel disgusting working for a company that undermines people's bodily autonomy.  To be clear - they haven't done this YET, but word on the grapevine is they plan to within the coming months.</p>

        <p>Still, call their bluff. Make them fire you. Make them jump through the hoops of properly documenting your disciplinary action, and then filing proper paperwork to reject your unemployment pay. Don't make it easy on them! My wife is going through the same thing, so I know it's difficult to stick in there.</p>

        <p>Exactly. Even if they say they're not accepting exemptions (religious or otherwise) file one anyways. Prove that you did everything in your power to keep your job through all the proper legal channels, but it was all in vain because they tried forcing you to take an experimental drug.</p>

<p>This is a good point.  Are religious exemptions effective, or do I need to find a medical one?  I'll try that route first if it comes down to it, but I don't want to work for evil drug pushers that want to force me to inject experimental bullshit into myself.</p>

        <p>My wife's religious exemption is currently pending, but the word on the street is it will surely get rejected (which I don't understand how they have that ability either, nope your religious beliefs aren't good enough). If it does go through they're saying she'll be required to have weekly testing, and if she does test positive for Covid, she won't be able to pull PTO from their Covid pay fund. No word on it the testing will be free either or if we'll have to pony up that expense.</p>
<p>My wife shares your sentiments towards her employer. What great respect she once held for them is nearly gone now.</p>

        <p>Don't refuse it, refusal is grounds for dismissal.  You are not refusing it, you are unable to give informed consent at this time. Make the pen pushers squirm. If you are going to resign go on sick first claim stress get as much as you can out of them. Yes you don't want to work for a company like this, make sure you cost them financially before you go.</p>

        <p>This is where we need to pursue this because it isnt as futile as people think. When companies see even 10% of their employees not leaving, but instead pursuing lawsuits against them, thats going to at least make them think.</p>

        <p>Bravo. In earlier times I would say make them fire you so you can collect unemployment but governments are moving to deny such benefits to the unvaccinated https://www.khou.com/mobile/article/news/verify/employer-requires-vaccine-denied-unemployment-for-refusing-fact-check/65-798b5edb-69f5-447d-9e3f-d61df9b3bd2a</p>

        <p>Unfortunately as u/SilentJohannes posted, people have been denied unemployment after termination for not getting the vaccine.  Also I haven't seen any successful lawsuits in this area because no lawyers have the balls to actually take it on.  It's a messed up world we live in, but if enough workers leave they will lose out on so much production and profit, it may cause them to take a good hard look at their policy.  Imagine 50%, hell even 40% of Disney just up and walking out tomorrow.  It would cause mass hysteria on a corporate level.</p>
