    <strong>Vax passports Canada</strong>
    <p><p>What other countries are using the vaccine passport and what kind of businesses are they using it for? I know Denmark has it mandatory for all restaurants but their government officially announced in October their scraping all vax passports. It wasn’t mandatory to enter clothing stores in Denmark is what I know too. They also allowed negative tests.</p>
<p>Do you guys think it’ll be mandatory for all restaurants in Canada like Denmark? And so you guys think the passport will last in Canada considering Denmark is scraping it and Israel has gotten rid of it?</p></p>

        <p>Talked about this last year. It's not about what's happening today, it's what's happening tomorrow. </p>
<p>Already got the line from my parents: </p>
<p>"Well our friends know you're not vaccinated, so they don't want to even be around us". </p>
<p>My reply: </p>
<p>You're ALL vaccinated, it sounds like your friends are fucking clueless.  If the vaccine works, there shouldn't be an issue. Your friends are being fed lies. Use common sense.</p>

        <p>It's just a fucking joke man. Typical boomer sheep. Raised me with a ridiculous amount of common sense, but they failed to look in the mirror and continue to be sheep. Maybe things change when you get older.</p>

        <p>Yes, unfortunately I think that will be the plan.</p>
<p>But it won't be outright discrimination.  Liberals never want to feel bad about themselves.  They'll use incentives.  For example, now that they have destroyed everyone's business/job/livelihood, they'll dangle a little carrot called "UBI".  Now, everyone can get "free" money!</p>
<p>Except wait!  You're going to need to be vaccinated to get this money.</p>
<p>Then they'll say, "oh, well it's your choice."</p>
<p>They will encourage people to have parties are not invite you.  They will encourage businesses to not hire you.</p>
<p>But they won't do it "officially", at least not at first.  They will gradually ease it in there.  As they are doing now.</p>

        <p>&rt; Except wait! You're going to need to be vaccinated to get this money.</p>
<p>This is what folks don't understand.  They are only thinking narrowly and in the short term.</p>
<p>What happens when you have a legit medical condition and can't get the vaccine, yet 80% of the employers are thinking about requiring it?  We already have bias against people who have certain illnesses and disabilities in the job market.  This one is going to be worse - you're going to have to fight against the "you're one of those anti-vaxxers."  In other words, simply "finding another job" is not as easy as it sounds.</p>
<p>Also, let's say the worst possible thing happens and there is some unforeseen issue with mRNA vaccines.  One argument is that these leave your system.  But what happens if Pfizer, Moderna, etc. say you need a booster every year or two?  Are the 80% of employers thinking of what happens if a significant enough percentage of people get some sort of disease in 5 or 10 years and they link it back?  I can see folks who aren't in public facing or medical roles arguing that they had less of a need to get the vaccine in the first place or even be in the office full time anyways.</p>

        <p>Wait until the case count starts going up again in the Fall.  They'll lock it down again and then tell us we'll all need booster shots.</p>
<p>It won't be enough to just have a vaccine passport.  You'll have to get it updated every year.  Then they'll add other vaccines to the passport.  Next thing you know, you won't be able to get into a local concert because your measles vaccine isn't up to date.  </p>
<p>The people behind this are criminals to humanity.</p>

        <p>yup -exactly this.  the writing has been on the wall for a long, long time now.  the leaked document has been right all along so far - no reason to think UBI is not next.</p>
<p>as for the vaccine passport, numerous "leaders" have already said that it is inevitable - it is just a matter of what it is going to look like.  absolutely disgusting that vaccine passports will be a thing here - while even asking for proof of vaccination is a $5000 fine in Florida.</p>
