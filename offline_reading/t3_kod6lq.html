    <strong>This virus has become a sort of Scarlett letter</strong>
    <p><p>The media has crafted a narrative about this virus so that people who get it are branded with a “Scarlett letter” if you will. </p>
<p>Every time someone falls sick to a virus (which, like the flu can be caught by anyone) the person who catches it is immediately assumed not have been “following the rules”</p>
<p>We see this happen most often when officials in the republican party catch it. They’re immediately demonized and called all typesof “COVidiot” and mocked for getting sick to a virus with many people hoping they even die. I’m not even a part of that party and I can see how dangerous this narrative has become.</p>
<p>We’ve taken a sickness and turned it into a brand of shame. When someone gets COViD people start to think “oh what did they do wrong to get this?” Instead of just realizing anyone is susceptible to a viral infection. </p>
<p>No ones ashamed to have the flu. Or pneumonia . Or Scarlett fever. But all of a sudden you get COViD and you’re immediately a dangerous menace to society who obviously wasn’t obeying the rules.</p>
<p>This shit is scary.</p></p>

        <p>Except, only Republicans or Conservatives get blamed if they get the virus.</p>
<p>If Democrats get the virus, it's the fault of Republicans.  Something something the beaches in Florida.</p>

        <p>We are well into victim blaming at this point. Will they go back to using gay slurs whenever someone gets HIV, to be logically consistent?</p>

        <p>I have to agree with you. This shit is getting seriously O L D to me because I know we have had people who have been "BLOCIAL TISTANCING!" since MARCH or earlier who have gotten CoVid-19 and no: They didn't have family members visit or anyone period visit!</p>
<p>This virus just spreads in various ways. Its basically uncontrollable and a leaky face diaper isn't going to help prevent you from getting it.</p>
<p>At this point they should be telling people "Mainline C, D and Zinc!" and admitting that is basically all you can damned well do to avoid this virus.</p>
<p>Just take supplements and cross your fingers because even in your own home it will find you!</p>

        <p>You have to realize that these woke people don't have good intentions.</p>
<p>They view the pandemic as a way to force their opinions down our throats. Woke and COVID are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>SJWs view this pandemic as their single best chance to completely take over society and remake it in their image. </p>
<p>When someone gets sick, they don't have the natural human reaction of hoping the person gets better. No, the first thing they do is decide whether person who got sick is one of the evil ones or not.</p>
<p>If a conservative (defined as being right of Mao) gets it then it's because they weren't following the rules because they're bad people. If a leftist gets it then it's because the bad people (conservatives, white men, etc.) weren't following the rules.</p>
<p>There's nothing we can do to make them stop hating us. We just have to live our lives the way we see fit and don't get too mad at the diaper fanatics. They're just following their programming.</p>

        <p>This sort of thing is not new. I think for much of human history, many diseases which are poorly understood or tied to sexual behavior have been stigmatized and those who have such diseases receive the stigma. It is tribalistic, though and I wish I knew how we could get past it.</p>
