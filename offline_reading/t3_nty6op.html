    <strong>Fauci Emails Reveal Significant Contradictions on Pandemic Planning and Fauci's Own Rhetoric</strong>
    <p><p>I just wrote my first article on Fauci's emails and it turns out he not only contradicted his own previous statements regarding pandemic planning but also missed a critical chance to save lives before lockdowns began.  You can read it <a href="https://sconsidine.medium.com/seven-emails-nine-days-in-march-and-one-colossal-failure-95faee358bad">here</a> or by clicking the link below.</p>

        <p>Pandemics just happen, and are outside of human control. I don't think there's any "pandemic planning" Fauci could have done ahead of time that would have saved lives. </p>
<p>What Fauci did wrong is </p>
<ol>
<li>Funding the Wuhan lab</li>
<li>Suggesting businesses and schools shut down</li>
</ol>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In fact, you're basically falling into the same trap that Fauci did with #2. He thought that humans could control COVID by shutting everything down, just like you think humans could have controlled COVID through "pre-pandemic planning."</p>
<p>Last year, I thought Fauci was a well-intentioned but almost always incorrect civil servant, and had trouble hating the guy no matter how much I disagreed with him.</p>
<p>However, as his funding of the Wuhan lab has become more clear, I've moved to genuinely hating Fauci.</p>

        <p>I agree, perhaps I should have worded it better and I am no fan of Fauci.  However he, as a lifelong public "servant", has public statements and studies going back years if not decades.  Some of these reports and statements included that pneumonia is a huge risk during pandemics and that pneumonia vaccines should be used to save lives going forward, but his emails and actions over the past year tell a different story.</p>

        <p>Spot on!  Medical professionals know that bacterial pneumonia is a killer.  There were a lot of deaths tha could have been prevented if we'd treated Covid like the flu.  Namely using antibiotics to fight any pneumonia causing bacteria.  The unfortunate reality is these antibiotics were delayed because Covid is a virus, and Covid is what's "killing people".</p>
<p>The sad truth is if we had done what decades of medicine had proven effective, then we wouldn't have had a pandemic.  And the drug companies couldn't have gotten all this money and a population-wide clinical trial for their novel drug mechanisms (mRNA and viral vevtor).</p>
