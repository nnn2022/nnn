    <strong>Lockdowns: a means of increasing state dependence and destroying your life.</strong>
    <p><p>Since the beginning of the situation regarding Covid-19, many things have become readily apparent to those who pay attention. The subject of this paper will be one of those realizations that me and many others have come to.</p>
<p><strong>Lockdowns.</strong> Governments worldwide are clearly obsessed with them and have been since day one. The question remains, why are they so obsessed with them and why are they turning a blind eye to evidence contradicting their effectiveness and showing their downsides far outweigh their positives?</p>
<p>I think the answer is quite simple, <em><strong>these lockdowns are a means to an end</strong></em>. They are not meant to help the populations they are inflicted upon and they were never supposed to, in fact, they seek to do the exact opposite. They are backwards by design.</p>
<p>Ever since they were first implemented, these lockdowns have done extreme amounts of harm to every population that has had to endure them. Small business owners have had their entire life’s work destroyed in front of their eyes, many have had to cease working, many have been forced to endure social isolation from friends and family for extended periods of time, kids have been forced to cease attending in-person education and so much more, there is no denying that these lockdowns have had devastating effects on the populations upon which they are inflicted.</p>
<p>There have been multiple studies and cost/benefit analyses done on the benefits and harms of lockdowns and they repeatedly find that their harms far outweigh their benefits. </p>
<p>One such analysis can be found here: </p>
<p>It does a good job illustrating just how monumental the difference between cost and benefit truly is.</p>
<p>The real kicker is that there is evidence at hand that not only proves they aren’t effective, but that they do <em><strong>absolutely nothing</strong></em>.</p>
<p>A study was conducted starting when Texas opened up 100%, what they found was that the reopening had <em>zero</em> discernible impact on cases or deaths: https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28804/w28804.pdf</p>
<p>That’s right, <strong>zero</strong>. We all suffered and continue to suffer, for <strong>nothing at all</strong>. No benefit to us <em>whatsoever</em> at the cost of enormous amounts of harm.</p>
<p>Another analysis done by a data scientist at MIT that showed lockdowns are not correlated with fewer deaths, but are correlated with more unemployment: https://fee.org/articles/mit-data-scientist-lockdowns-not-correlated-with-fewer-deaths-but-are-correlated-with-more-unemployment/</p>
<p>Beyond that, there is a multitude of other examples that they do not work, Florida being another prime one, as well as Sweden. https://shahar-26393.medium.com/not-a-shred-of-doubt-sweden-was-right-32e6dab1f47a</p>
<p>With all that being said, why are governments absolutely silent in the face of this information and instead opting to push for lockdowns in the same way they have been this whole time, in some cases being even stronger advocates for them?</p>
<p>Again, the answer is simple:</p>
<p><strong>They were never meant to work, or to help you.</strong> They were meant to
<em><strong>weaken you</strong></em> in every regard possible.</p>
<p>Increasing state dependence and weakening the population is the name of the game here.</p>
<p>If you are weak and dependant on the leftovers and crumbs the government decides to spare you, you are at their mercy in a very real sense. They are purposefully increasing state dependence on a massive scale to create an environment where the people lack the means to stand up against the state and the rising tide of totalitarianism even if we had the will and resolve to do so.</p>
<p><em><strong>“The difference between a welfare state and a totalitarian state is a matter of time.”</strong></em> -Ayn rand</p>
<p>This entire situation from start to finish has been a Hegelian dialectic to strip you of your rights and freedoms, to destroy nations economically and financially, to increase state dependence, to increase trust in the state and to get you to take these mRNA shots, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>It has all been used as a vector for the great reset, just as the WEF themselves describe. They are laying down the groundwork for a totalitarian regime with elements of medical fascism, mass surveillance, the loss of basic freedoms, social credit, digital currency, bio-monitoring, centralized government and many more elements that help cement it as a dystopian nightmare. </p>
<p>If we do not stand up for what truly matters now, we will forever live as slaves.</p>
<p>Stand up not only for yourself, but for everybody you know, every member of your country and every human on earth. </p>
<p>Stand for freedom. Stand for love. Stand for humanity.</p>
<p>Join me and hundreds of millions of others worldwide in this fight and <strong>stand united against tyranny</strong>.</p>
<p>We won’t let them take away our freedom and ways of life. Not now and not ever.</p>
<p><em><strong>“And he who is not sufficiently courageous to defend his soul — don’t let him be proud of his ‘progressive’ views, and don’t let him boast that he is an academician or a people’s artist, a distinguished figure or a general. Let him say to himself: I am a part of the herd and a coward. It’s all the same to me as long as I’m fed and kept warm.”</strong></em> -Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</p></p>

        <p>As far as I am aware there is zero evidence for that claim and I fundamentally disagree with your framing of her. I don’t necessarily agree with everything she has ever said, but she has many great points.</p>
<p>Even if she was an imbecile, (which I don’t think she was), I would revert back to a great Seneca quote:</p>
<p><strong>“I shall never be ashamed of citing a bad author if the line is good.”</strong> -Seneca</p>
