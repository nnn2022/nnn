        <p>This could be an interesting piece in the puzzle I'm trying to piece together of how our bodies actually work.</p>
<p>My theory is that what we call virus actually is some sort of inter-cellular-communication-mechanism.</p>
<p>For example: Damaged cells might release these to inform killer-cells that there's a job for them to do. That would very much explain a correlation between viral load and sickness. It's just that we got it wrong with cause and effect.</p>
<p>A lot of mechanisms in the body work with receptors and molecular keys or ligands that dock in these receptors. For example when certain cells want to rest they release melatonin, which is a key to dock at certain receptors in the brain and this is what makes us tired.</p>
<p>Caffeine has a structural similarity to melatonin and thus blocks the receptors meant for it, which prevents us from getting tired. However, the body increases the amount of receptors and thus we need more and more caffeine to score the same effect and we get addicted in the sense that we'd grow much more tired than normal if we don't have it.</p>
<p>A lot of drugs work like that but with other receptors.</p>
<p>Now imagine the following: The spike-proteins indirectly produced by the vaccine clog up all the receptors meant for the naturally occurring spike-protein on the virus, and it is indeed our cells producing the virus to communicate something to the cells with the receptor. Now whatever that is supposed to trigger doesn't work anymore. The pathway is ruined.</p>
<p>To compensate the cells now produce more and more virus and flood the entire body with it. There's more and more damaged cells that don't get cleaned up and they keep metabolizing resources that were meant for the healthy cells.</p>
<p>Tissue-regeneration would essentially be halted.</p>
<p>Note: This is a theory from someone who has not undergone any medical education. However, this means I'm also not prevented from thinking outside the box of established medical dogmas that otherwise are just accepted and not questioned.</p>
