    <strong>UK School Cover Manager Experiences Since Our Glorious Return</strong>
    <p><p>Hi!</p>
<p>Thought I’d share some firsthand experiences my end. We returned to school on Thursday 3rd and every day at least one teacher (or a child of one) has exhibited one or the other of the vague, all-encompassing symptoms of COVID. They phone me up first thing in the morning, panic-stricken, wanting to be in school to make up for all that lost time with the students, but the protocols are they must first “pass a test”.</p>
<p>Tests are currently taking between 3-4 days to be returned. One teacher took his this Thursday morning and phoned yesterday to find they had the swab but would not be getting to it until mid-week next. He considers this mere incompetence. Perhaps it is. But when one government is so consistently wrong and inept at every stage one has to wonder if something more insidious is going on. The controlled demolition of the education system continues. Zooming is our future apparently.</p>
<p>As yet my school has not mandated masks at all. The headteacher has made it clear that that will change, if/ when we experience our first positive case within the student population. I dread that, since masks are a tipping-point for me and I simply will not wear or stay silent amongst students who are being compelled to do so.</p>
<p>We have put each year group into bubbles, so that, should one student test positive, only that year group need quarantine, but the whole thing is ridiculous. I didn’t buy the story in March and I’m growing increasingly frustrated and open with my colleagues about this charade and the ludicrous display of OCD which, if exhibited by one person alone, would result in their mental health being seriously questioned.</p>
<p>Some teachers see through this. My openeness has encouraged them to talk to me and then to others. Many still believe, but are sensible and have yearned to come back under any conditions. None prefer to be at home, zooming. A couple of teachers have come in each day with aprons, gloves, masks AND visors but, as I said, this is only in a couple of cases. I know teachers are kvetching here on Reddit apparently, but they do not represent the vast majority.</p>
<p>We care about the kids and we want to teach. Everything is conspiring against that.   </p>
<p>I should add, out of 10 tests so far, not a single teacher has tested positive and not a single student or relative of a student at the school has tested positive since March!</p></p>
