    <strong>It is impossible to be seen by a doctor at CVS, urgent care, etc. without them shoving covid down your throat</strong>
    <p><p>Heya folks, story time: My fiance currently has a sinus infection and it's been about 6 days. In case she needed antibiotics, she scheduled an appointment at the CVS area where they check you out and prescribe. They called her on her way there and asked her symptoms. After explaining, they demanded her to get a covid test before being seen because her sinus infection symptoms "sound like covid". </p>
<p>She politely told them to pound sand and reassured them it wasn't covid, as she's already had it. They wouldn't give in because "it's inside a store, and around people". She then went to urgent care and the first thing they tried to do was give her a covid test. She told them to come nowhere near her with it and she's just sick. The doctor who saw her said "so I heard you refused the covid test?". She got quite defensive about that and asked him if normal colds and sicknesses have disappeared, because last time she checked they haven't. He then reluctantly explained that it was most likely a viral sinus infection and no antibiotics could be prescribed. She packed her stuff and said "Thanks, see ya later". </p>
<p>Now, I've gone about 5 of her symptomatic days feeling fine and now I've come down with what she has. No big deal, it just usually hits me a bit harder cause I have pretty bad allergies to pollon (it's really bad up here in new england) and allergy induced asthma. Although I haven't touched my inhaler in over a year, I sometimes have to when I get sick. </p>
<p>With all that being said, it seems medical treatment can be denied now, and they will absolutely shove covid down your throat by trying to get you to take the brain tickler. Anyway, does anyone else have similar stories?</p></p>

        <p>Why are you going to CVS to see a doctor?  I don't even understand...</p>
<p>Find a doctor online, talk to him before you go see him...get your prescription.  Wipe hands</p>

        <p>My wife and I are trying to conceive, we have to go the IVF route due to issues beyond our control. We had our first consult last week and we had a Zoom call in which one of the first questions the doctor asked was if we had been vaccinated for Covid. </p>
<p>That question has zero to do with us trying to conceive a child and the shot isn’t even recommended for those trying to conceive… we get this from our families too. </p>
<p>My wife and I now have our answers down , we smile politely and say yup! And then continue with whatever it is we are doing. We got fed up with the vitriol that was spewed at us every time we told someone no, we also have both had and recovered from Covid…so in this case if you can’t beat em join em and rest assured you actually don’t have that poison in your body.</p>
