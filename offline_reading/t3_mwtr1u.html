    <strong>What was life during the 1957 and 1968 pandemics like?</strong>
    <p><p>Question aimed at older Redditors who lived through them.</p>
<p>Did those pandemics get any coverage in the media at all? Did most people even realize those pandemics existed?</p>
<p>Both were actually worse than COVID-19. IDK if they got any attention at the  time, but they’re completely forgotten today.</p></p>

        <p>“Do you remember the Hong Kong Flu and the Asian Flu and the London Flu scares? <strong>These were all medically-made epidemics mixed with the usual common colds which people have every year.</strong></p>
<p>Now (1976) we are being worked on again by the vaccine-epidemic makers in their effort to force another multi-million dollar vaccine sale caper. Their con men have already talked President Ford into handing over $135 million dollars to start their vaccine racket. Even the insurance companies refused to become involved with such an obviously dangerous and crooked scheme. So, again the medical and drug con men induced the appropriate government officials to guarantee insurance against the, possible billions of dollars in law suits which could be brought against the vaccine promoters if the vaccine campaign is carried out as planned. It’s a good thing Ford was voted out of office. It’s too bad he wasn’t "dumped" before he paid the poison squad the MONEY to poison the whole population.”</p>

        <p>this is a great feat, and could be replicated for the seasonal flu every year, but the op was about fake news coverage.</p>

        <p>Life during the 1968 pandemic was completely normal for young people. I wasn't around, but my parents were, one in junior high that year and one near the end of elementary. When I asked them about it they said they said they didn't know there was a pandemic flu at the time.</p>
