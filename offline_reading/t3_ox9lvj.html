    <strong>The mask is a physical representation of directed hate.</strong>
    <p><p>When fighting a war, how does one tell who the enemy is?
The enemy is usually the person wearing a different colored uniform, right?</p>
<p>This is why the mask is nothing more than an identifier. People on popular subs have often said things along the lines of, "I want to take my mask off, but I don't want to be mistaken for one of <em>those</em> people."</p>
<p>The mask is the separator for the US and THEM mentality. It's the Jewish star, it's the leper shouting, "unclean!" It's the way that the zealots identify who to hate.</p>
<p>This erases any bond of fellowship, any familiarity or comradery  among people and makes us enemies at first sight. The people whom zealots claim to hate could be their barber, their neighbor, or even family, but the mask means everything to these people. </p>
<p>Never before have I seen people judge another so harshly or so thoroughly for one decision. To discount or discredit the entire person for one personal choice. </p>
<p>This is what the media has shown us, and it is why they are the real enemy here.</p></p>

<p>Little do they know, they'll still be the ones dying.</p>
