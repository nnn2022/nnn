<li>The PCR test does not tell you if you have Covid-19 and are being used in a manner that guarantees a significant number of false positives.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.Masks are at best marginally effective and at worst actually causing bacterial and fungal pneumonias.</p>
<p>3.Not everyone is susceptible to Sars-Cov-2.</p>
<p>4.Asymptomatic spread is rare and does not meaningfully drive transmission.</p>
<ol>
<li>Depending on State a Covid related death, which are the deaths being parroted by the media as deaths due to Covid, are any death within 20-60 days of a +PCR test.</li>

        <p>What thegreengumball said just thought I’d add some more to fill out some of these points... </p>
<p>The PCR test only detects virus fragments and says nothing about infection, contagion or disease. It is unspecific with regard to SARS-CoV-2, and in some cases also gives positive results with older viruses that are still in circulation and their descendants. People who tested positive are rare (less than 1% since June 2020), most of them asymptomatic. And a large number of them are likely to have a false positive test result. According to the results of the interlaboratory comparison of the German Accreditation Service, the false-positive rate for a blank sample is 1.4% and for a sample with a harmless corona virus it is 7.6%. The positive results in summer 2020 should therefore largely reflect the background noise of the test itself.</p>
<p>The biochemist and Nobel laureate Kary Mullis developed the PCR test in 1983 to amplify DNA sequences in vitro. According to Mullis, his test is not suitable for diagnostic purposes. Even nowadays, the test cannot determine whether an active viral infection is present. The gene sequences found with the test can just as easily come from a virus infection that has already been overcome or a contamination that does not lead to an infection at all. It is questionable whether the so-called Drosten test will find the correct gene sequence at all. Many German laboratories use so-called house tests on the basis of the test protocols published by the WHO (compare e.g. the so-called Drosten test assay of January 17, 2020). In accordance with European standards, these generally require official validation. In practice, however, this has largely been dispensed with because of the “emergency”.</p>
<p>ARE HEALTHY PEOPLE AT RISK?
No, the body is protected by cross immunity, antibodies and / or at the cellular level by “killer lymphocytes”. As with any flu, old, multimorbid people with poor immune systems are at risk.</p>

<p>Ask them to show you the correlation between states that locked down and those that didn't.  New York and New Jersey right at the top,  Florida and Texas in the middle. It's totally random.</p>
