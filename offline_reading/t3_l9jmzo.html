    <strong>Are covid "long-haulers" really just experiencing stress/anxiety symptoms and possibly ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)?</strong>
    <p><p>Look up <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5131805/">ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)</a> on Google Scholar and you'll find a myriad of studies that show that (1 in 4) patients put on ventilators likely develop heart, lung, and multiple organ failure, hypoxemia (low oxygen in blood), biotrauma (inflammation in the lungs), brain damage, and an increased mortality rate.</p>
<p>The same symptoms I see people having on r/covid19positive all sound like <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety-symptoms">stress/anxiety</a> to me, especially since many of them report getting x-rays, CT scans, bloodwork, etc. done and their results come out perfectly fine but they still can't "figure out what's wrong." </p>
<p>When I experience anxiety, I also get a rapid heart rate, trouble breathing, heavy sweating, muscle twitches, insomnia, fatigue, diarrhea, etc. How many of these "long-haulers" are really just experiencing stress/anxiety or VILI?</p></p>

        <p>My opinion is that these “long haulers” are a complex group of people, many of whom suffer from mental illness such as severe anxiety or chronic fatigue syndrome, a very small proportion actually got really sick and have some long term lung damage, and the rest are just people with multiple false positives- they are no longer infectious but for whatever reason they always test positive.</p>

        <p>The hysteria about "long covid" is simply another re-write of medical science to keep the fear machine running.</p>
<p>In the past, it was common knowledge that <em>all</em> diseases had "outlier cases" with unusual side effects. Ordinary influenza has a side-effect rate of up to 30% - no one screams about that in the MSM.</p>
<p>Post 1918 Spanish Flu, it was Encephalitis Lethargica. But any medical history that imperils the WuFlu narrative is memory-holed.</p>

        <p>I’m going to share my own personal experience.</p>
<p>I got Covid a few days before the lockdown last March. Was pretty sick, shit my brains out for a few days with a fever and then the following weeks had bad chest pain and breathing heavy with a cough. Couldn’t exert myself physically because I couldn’t breathe. I’m a healthy 29 year old btw. It wasn’t super awful, inconvenient more than anything. Anyway, I still get that tight chest pain and difficulty breathing for about 10-15 minutes randomly. I do compare the chest pain to a panic attack chest pain, but it’s not that. It’ll happen when I’m just chillin, watching tv and my heart doesn’t start racing like a panic attack. I mean it doesn’t effect me much, but I can imagine there are some people who are worse off. I Still believe the “long hauler” stories are over hyped by the media and I still don’t believe in lockdowns.</p>
