    <strong>I got suspended from Twitter for the first time in more than a decade, because of COVID</strong>
    <p><p>I'm not stranger to having heated discussions on twitter, and I've actually been in the middle of a twitter lynching about 4 years ago, when I criticized some Japanese furry artist that made basically anti-gay content, where sadly being anti-gay is still the norm, and even got some stalkers trying to get my private information, and calling to what they though was my workplace at the time to get me to lose my job.</p>
<p>Some people at the time made multiple false DMCA claims to try to get some of my tweets removed, but even in those very heated debates, were I more than 1 time said off color jokes, NEVER got my account suspended.</p>
<p>Now, after trying to talk sense to some guy who responded to one of my tweets I had made about the lockdowns, this guy just ended up insulting me and throwing some of those obnoxious animated GIFs, for what I responded with the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.gyazo.com/a9a7668be9c9fcfa535acb41ca744fa2.png">a9a7668be9c9fcfa535acb41ca744fa2.png (614Ã—313) (gyazo.com)</a> </p>
<p>The tweet is obviously saying, in a hyperbolic way, that you should change your way of thinking or just shut up, but after posting some more animated GIFs in response, I get this screen I've never seen before about how my account is suspended for "encouraging suicide", even thou after looking at the Twitter rules, since I never made use of any of the so called "encouraging" statements, using the words "kill yourself", in a snarky way shouldn't count as a violation, but of course, because probably people at twitter do not like what I have to say they are very liberal about what the rules actually say.</p>
<p>Let me be very clear, I've received HUNDREDS of tweets actual threats to my life, with pretty disgusting xenophobic comments, and every time I've reported some of these guys, they NEVER get suspended.</p>
<p>Twitter, for the most part, always ignore all violation reports, unless they are politically charged, or of something twitter actually cares about.</p>
<p>I'm fighting the so called violation, I don't think I'm going to win it because it is COVID and twitter is an obvious pro lockdown shit company, and even if I do, the guy who did this basically won, since he is getting rid, even if it is temporary, of a voice he doesn't like.</p>
<p>Also, after my account got suspended, the guy did another response, with another animated GIF laughing, which makes me think this guy is used to do this and getting accounts suspended.</p></p>
