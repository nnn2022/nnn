    <strong>Does Anyone Else Wonder What Sort of Superbugs and Immune Dysfunction We're Creating by Excessive Sanitizing of Everything?</strong>
    <p><p>Before COVID, the idea that over-sanitizing has negative effects was becoming more and more accepted, from the creation of antibiotic-resistant superbugs to the "hygiene hypothesis", that out over-sanitized environments may be contributing to increases in allergies and autoimmune conditions because in normal conditions, people (especially children) are exposed to plenty of stuff that the immune system needs to respond to, and that modern sanitized conditions don't give the immune system the "exercise" it needs, leading to more immune dysfunction. Also, over-sanitization can weaken the microbiomes of our body that perform important functions.</p>
<p>Now in 2020 with COVID, everything is being hyper-sanitized to a level we've never seen before, and so many people are afraid to or prohibited from going out and doing the normal activities that are needed to build a healthy immune system. Few people seem to care anymore about possible negative consequences of this. The children will be the hardest hit, as is the case with so much of this COVID hysteria.</p></p>

        <p>I am a carrier of MRSA. I get active MRSA infections every few years or so. I know what to look out for and can get treatment so it is a normal thing for me. It is known as a superbug. I’m worried about what other worse things that are being created. I can manage my infections. They can kill me if left untreated but I always get meds.</p>
<p>I’m worried it will either mutate and evolve, or some other bug will come up that’s worse. As someone who as dealt with these things, the idea of these bugs is super scary.</p>

        <p>Sorry to read of your affliction. The sad problem you face is that every time they give you industrial strength antibiotics, there is a risk of training the MRSA to become even more virulent. Also, not to mention that those "meds" wreak havoc on the immune system and gut bacteria. The Russians had been experimenting with bacteriophages, perhaps there's a possibility your MRSA might react to that sort of treatment? Since MRSA and VRE are usually acquired in hospital, staying clear of them is always a good idea. Especially with this "scary virus" hysteria: you are sure to catch it in a hospital since they "test" for it and "testing" for it is a sure way of getting it (because of "test" with massive false positive rate).</p>

        <p>yeah, i don’t know how i got it. i hadn’t been near a hospital when i got my first infection. thank god i don’t get infections much so i don’t need to use my meds as often. they take a sample of the pus every time so they can basically calibrate it to help specially with my case.</p>

        <p>Just wanna reach out and say I also randomly got MRSA not from a hospital. I think it was my public dance studio- drop-in classes in NYC so no way to know who was going to be there each week. I was an older teen and I was super embarrassed so I didn’t tell my parents for months, but eventually we had it taken care of. Still have a deep scar from my first occurrence. I’ve never heard of another person who got it- solidarity! I guess?</p>

        <p>I'm a carrier too. I haven't had an outbreak in awhile, but over a 2 year period or so, I had 4-5 serious infections that needed medical attention to be drained and healed. Some of the worst pain in my life has come from draining these abscesses. Had I done nothing, these open sores would have just kept penetrating my flesh until the bone, perhaps even the bloodstream, which can be fatal. MRSA can be spread easily, and I'll never know where I got it from. It used to exist solely in hospitals but now is in the community.</p>
<p>It's unsettling to think how easily I could be taken down by such a thing that now lives on my skin. In my opinion the current culture of sanitizing everything is only making this worse.</p>

        <p>Absolutely. It doesn't help that we are encouraging everybody to hide out and not get exposed to germs either. I don't have any hand sanitizer and do not plan to get any, but everywhere I go there's some around every corner.</p>

I rarely get sick and have been a few times in just the last couple months, it’s awful.

        <p>At this point I don't use the hand sanitizer. I wash normally like after bathroom, before a meal...etc but nothing extensive. I traveled to Wyoming this week and my husband's family had a cold. I directly sat and hungout with them so my body can build immunities. I felt my body trying to get sick but it immediately fought it off. I take my vitamin C, zinc, and elderberry everyday. Basically we have to train our immune systems into doing what it knows best. It seemed to do the trick on this trip.</p>

        <p>This is something that has been massively overlooked. After the first lockdown, when I started interacting with people again, I was sneezing all the time. Your immune system doesn’t get stronger by limiting interaction and cleaning everything. </p>
<p>Likewise, social distancing will be driving evolution of Covid to better transmit in a socially distanced host. We may not operate under survival fittest anymore, nature still does though.</p>

        <p>I don’t know about superbugs but I’m wondering over time the massive amount of chemicals being used everywhere to disinfect could have harmful effects. I remember reading about a prison where the inmates were having respiratory issues because the guards would spray some chemical on common surfaces constantly during the day.</p>
<p>Also a lot of these chemicals might end up in waterways just like runoff from cars. I can’t imagine what the environmental impact might be.</p>

        <p>I remember my science teacher in Secondary school, before he was censored by the left, said that climate change was a bunch of nonsense and that 99.9% killing handwashes create resistant bugs. I remember he said it was a mixture of anger and sorrow.</p>

        <p>Yep. I always see those stupid hand sanitizer things everywhere and pass right by them. I have a two year old and I let him play outside, eat dirt, roll around in the grass, breathe air. You know, all the things kids need to build a strong immune system lol.</p>

        <p>One of the things that makes people feel better about sending their kids to daycare is that the exposure to pathogens builds their immune systems and reduces their risk of childhood leukemia. </p>
<p>That is the kinda thing that’s more worrying. I don’t think the hand washing and sanitizers being everywhere makes much of a difference. People aren’t doing it like they were in February. They think masks give them superpowers.</p>

        <p>i am aware of the effects of oversanitizing and not giving your immune system a fight. but i do not give a single fuck about the health of authoritarian coronadoomers. i only care if children and nonauthoritarians get harmed by oversanitization and avoidance of germs</p>

        <p>In my workplace, they're spraying down all the surfaces people touch with hdqC2 from Spartan Chemicals.  It's labeled as a pesticide by the EPA.  On the safety data sheet, it specifies that it can be fatal if absorbed through the skin, can cause skin burns, upper respiratory irritation, etc.  They even have it sitting in the exercise room for anyone to spray and wipe down equipment with.</p>
<p>In an adjacent city to mine, I've seen contractors wearing full protection suits spraying chemicals all over walls, floors, surfaces, etc with a spraying machine of some kind after hours in restaurants on a main street.</p>
<p>This is really happening folks.  Who knows what kind of damage they're doing to people's health.</p>

        <p>Yes, I agree.</p>
<p>We need to build up our immune system and that is not just an afterthought as many would like to believe. It also does not mean that we need to live in filth all the time. Sure, wash your hands when returning from outside and all that, but don't use hand sanitizer multiple times a day. If possible try not to use hand sanitizer at all. Substitute it with a quick wash or rinse.</p>
<p>Basically, clean hands and environment is good and all, but don't be fanatic about it.</p>
