        <p>Funny, in the 18 years I lived in a frequently cyclone hit western and first world town, this is the first I've heard of that. Especially when there is zero active cases of the virus in a state with all borders closed. But I get it, the money needed to fill cyclone kits with products targeting a virus with a 99+% recovery rate takes far higher priority than your house being destroyed üëç</p>

        <p>Your ignorance is proof of sweet fuck all. Hand sanitiser is ubiquitously useful and a 20 cents face mask is blameless and also not unreasonable. </p>
<p>You also seem to have a rather extreme view that the choice is have a face mask OR do things to protect your house and belongings, you can do both, should do both. Acting like a child because you are bothered by face masks doesn't stop personal protection from infectious diseases being reasonable.</p>

        <p>Face masks can damage health. Certainly constant use damage my health in the same way smoking cigarettes do.</p>
<p>As of the study you posted it shows that higher stress leads to higher levels of damage and mortality. It's always like this, so what's the science? The reason our lifespan increased it's due to higher living standards in comparison with older times. Homeless people can have lots of "communicable diseases" which of course is a myth, because it's just poor/worse living conditions the culprit.</p>
<p>As of protection, indirectly comes from living standards and there are limits. Wearing a mask to do a job might avoid direct damage related with what you do. However wearing a mask as part of your lifestyle affects your respiratory function in multiple ways in general. So there is a difference how you are using something.</p>

<p>You want me to back how I feel wearing a facemask?</p>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29395560/</a></p>
<p><em>Dyspnea variation was significantly higher with surgical mask</em></p>
<p>That was with healthy subjects. But I don't just trust papers. I try it myself. And the result is obvious. Plus, inconsistent breathing (like through facemasks all day long), even slight, profoundly affects heart rate variability (HRV).  Maybe you don't understand the implications...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311559/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311559/</a></p>
<p><em>Reduced HRV was also found to be a greater risk factor of death post‚Äìmyocardial infarction than other known risk factors</em></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;So during a natural disaster is fine by this logic</p>
<p>Where do you see a natural disaster or pandemic? I am not affected or infected by something natural. Lockdowns, facemasks and other crappy restrictions are purely artificial and they do affect me. And they do damage health. And the environment even worse that cigarettes.</p>
<p>If you have a doubt wear a facemask and see how you physically perform. When there was a benefit and before this scamdemic started, masks were used were appropriate. For example to dive or to weld something etc. They were not used to improve physical performance because they affect it negatively.</p>
<p>It's common sense but obviously you are paid to twist it.</p>

        <p>Yeah that's right, now you're getting it. I don't get impressed when the MD call something like back pain "fibromyalgia". It's BS. </p>
<p>And no I don't care get about pharma papers, I care about results what happens is directly related to what you do. Someone who gets sick doesn't mean everyone else is sick. And if someone is healthy doesn't mean everyone else is healthy. </p>
<p>Seems you are surprised when I say I don't get some flu or some covid. It's not going to happen regardless of social interactions, facemask and the other BS claimed. But I can change what I do and then it can happen and I can get infected by pretty much everything. That's dead easy to do.</p>

<p>You are watching too many sci-fi movies. There is nothing unreal of what I do, because it's happening. Just because you can't lift 10lbs doesn't mean nobody else can. Same with some disease you are scared of. Ain't happening for me. And it's measurable obviously because I don't get sick or infected. Do you know what happens when you listen to this guy here?</p>

<p>You get sick, guaranteed, because that's what you follow. So let me tell you something to make it clear. If the medical system or medical method, or drug or whatever that comes out has an effect, it is visible. And it's not need to be mandated. So far I haven't seen that. There are claims, mandates, restrictions and drugs but I don't see effect. That's first hand experience not some pharma-BS someone posts online.</p>

        <p>Ok, great, you are just about intelligible though deeply irrational.</p>
<p>You are not medical, I am, you will rarely see the direct effects of a medical intervention because you are not medical. I assume my evidence, of my direct experience and observation of medical work is not sufficient for you?</p>

        <p>I don't care what you're doing. I am not here to debate that. I am here because the crappy restrictions and lousy medical system impact my health. Is that clear?</p>

        <p>Its very clear.</p>
<p>But what I was trying to get at is that if you do not believe anything but your direct experience, then almost everything - either truth or lie - is unprovable to you, so why even debate?</p>

        <p>I told you why there is a debate. It's because this scam is mandated and it does damage the environment which apparently I live in it, that's why.</p>
