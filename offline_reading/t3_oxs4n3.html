    <strong>Incentives and Coercion...</strong>
    <p><p>Well, the day has finally fucking arrived. Work is incentivizing the vaccine with a deadline of (you guessed it) October. I have been in the boat that the vaccine side effects are largely unknown/dangerous, and especially useless for the young as they don't stop catching it or spreading it, but my lord did they make this a hard choice.. </p>
<p>$1500. </p>
<p>I never believed that I would be met with a sum that felt "worth it", but this may be the first time I've considered it. I'm not exactly struggling for money, but I also just bought a car and we are saving for a wedding, so everything helps... FUCK I hate this. I hate the coercion, I hate the obvious scare tactics and implications of this October date, I hate that the side effects have been blowing up, and I HATE that it implies some future action. </p>
<p>My company has been pretty relaxed and asked people who are unvaccinated to continue to wear a mask, but as expected, vaxxed or not, no one wears a mask anymore. The problem with this is, I'm CERTAIN that this incentive is just a clever way to get a headcount of who is vaccinated. So even if I hold my ground and don't get it, I won't turn in the card and they will KNOW that I'm not vaccinated, thus begging the question... </p>
<p>What happens since they know I have not been masking for ages? Will I be asked to mask up again? Will I be fired? I'm in a bind and I am struggling with this decision because frankly, I need this job. </p>
<p>I'm pretty certain that my grandfather's first heart attack was DIRECTLY instigated by the vaccine, I am certain that my other grandpa's arm swelling which he ended up in the hospital for was as well... at the same time, they are old and probably can't handle it as well. I look over at /r/covidvaccinated and it terrifies me how many young people are struggling with side effects (from fucking numbness to deafness, my lord...), but then again some are fine.. barring long term unknown effects. Is $1500 worth a vaccine that could potentially cause a harmful side effect? Fuck no it isn't... but for the long-term financial stability of my family and the implications of being fired for not masking while not being vaxxed, I believe I may be getting it... We're a family of 4 and I am the only source of income.. I don't think I can risk this..</p>
<p>Fucking hell..</p></p>

        <p>I can understand someone feeling cornered into taking it with threats of being fired (then you lose your main source of income, health insurance, etc)...but for money/incentives?</p>
<p>I'd advise to not take it even for $1500. As /u/Kal7rider wrote, your health isn't worth that amount of money.</p>

        <p>The $1500 isn't really much of a driving factor, more the FEAR of what comes after the turn-in deadline. </p>
<p>They will have a headcount of who is/isn't, they already know that NO ONE has been masking, so now anyone that doesn't turn it in will be assumed unvaxxed. They will likely call those people to HR, grill them, ask for evidence of vaccine, and fire you for not following company policy. That's my major fear :(</p>

        <p>Right, I see.</p>
<p>I know it's tough out there. I really wish I could give you better advice aside from maybe looking for a new job, which isn't easy right now given the trash job market.</p>

        <p>1500$ is a joke to risk yourself potentially dying in the next two years.</p>
<p>Your healthy heart isn't worth 1500$. </p>
<p>When has the government or anyone for that matter been so eager to pay people to get a vaccine? </p>
<p>Starving kids can't get food but HOLD THE LINE they'll deliver them the Covid vaccines by land, sea, and air travel! </p>

        <p>The $1500 is chump change, but it is more the implication of them NOW having a headcount, and reacting to it accordingly. Those that don't turn it in will be likely fired if they haven't worn a mask leading up to that point. That's what I'm afraid of.</p>
