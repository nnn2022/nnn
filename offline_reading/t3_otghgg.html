    <strong>Start sending emails to the President and Vice President</strong>
    <p><p>Hello Mr. Biden. I would like to inform you of an underlying event going on in today's society that is limiting the freedom of the people in our very nation. The world has been split within its own backyard and those of us living our own lives have been forced to recognize the spotlight at hand. The coronavirus vaccine is scaring people because of missing data. It is not right for people to have to deal with the amount of stress put on them with the amount of misinformation circulating in the media. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This email is to try and show you the psychological debunk of the issue going on at hand along with evidence that shows what we are going through behind the scenes. I'm also asking you for the love of god to help us.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>When looking from a psychological perspective we have fallen into two sides the vaccinated and the anti-vaxxed. With this in mind the vaccinated have become subject to their own bodies and are made to be force fed. This makes sense right? Because good people have put something in their body to trust, so now they have to either lay back on the media that says that they are on their side or they can choose to ignore it. Both options of approaching information in this way are met with dissonance because a large portion of people will not be able to properly conduct logical analysis because it is their own body. Aren't we supposed to be making a smarter America? How is someone supposed to convince themselves that what is happening in the media is false if what is happening on the other side supposedly seems to hurt them. It is a fight or flight response that has to be looked at responsibly.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This is happening because the United States have failed to show the statistics of breakthrough cases as well as deaths by vaccine. In other countries it has been reported upfront. Limiting "vaccine hesitancy" should never be used as an excuse</p>

<p>This is all I could fit in the text box before I sent it to the president and vice president. Please send this message if you can't find the words to express the situation or write out your own bout. My information that I put in, was the Atlanta Piedmont Hospital phone number  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=atlanta%20piedmont%20number&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS751US751&amp;oq=atlanta+piedmont+number&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l4.3703j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbs=lf:1,lf_ui:1&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk0302-HuplOepMYOE4DjCeGw5r634Q:1627496770283&amp;rflfq=1&amp;num=10&amp;rldimm=10361705813315035831&amp;lqi=ChdhdGxhbnRhIHBpZWRtb250IG51bWJlciICEAFI_YyHR1oYEAEYABgBIhBhdGxhbnRhIHBpZWRtb250kgEIaG9zcGl0YWyqARAQASoMIghwaWVkbW9udCgA&amp;phdesc=9Op7OgiYNmI&amp;ved=2ahUKEwia6vX2sYbyAhWKmmoFHRl3B0cQvS4wAHoECA0QOA&amp;rlst=f#">(404) 605-5000</a>, along with the street 1968 Peachtree Road and the city Atlanta, state Georgia. If we all send a message from this hospital or similar locations it could be taken as an organized American cry from help from a certain area and either the president or vice president is bound to look at it</p>
