    <strong>Why do doomers blame “the COVIDiots” for the pandemic?</strong>
    <p><p>Often you see 13yo Reddit doomers say “we could be back to normal if everyone just had worn the mask”</p>
<p>Where do they even get this? Lord Fauci (pbuh) isn’t even saying that. Almost every scientist agrees that COVID couldn’t be eradicated after it spread everywhere in March (or earlier). Even the most doomer of scientists don’t think it will end before herd immunity sets in, either from a vaccine or from natural infections.</p>
<p>Where are they getting this? Honest question.</p></p>

        <p>It’s easier to blame others and find a scapegoat rather than admitting we were wrong</p>
<p>Rather than admit we are wasting a year of our lives it’s easier to pin the blame on some group of people and to create an enemy. </p>
<p>Of course it holds no actual evidence.  It’s the same as those people who say “ we need a hard lockdown enforced by the army” who seem to forget that things have to stay open to keep workers moving and the economy somewhat afloat</p>

        <p>Naivety, and a lack of awareness/critical thought. Their assumptions are built upon the idea we can fully control something we have very little control over and a lack of knowledge around how the man made world works.</p>
<p>If we boarded everyone in their homes for some set period of time (from a few weeks to months) we'd not solve the issue of spread, since to enforce such a situation we'd need police or military who are not immune to spreading anything (even with the toughest PPE mistakes can and will occur). And in order to keep the lights on, gas flowing etc we need others working (essential workers in the New Normal lexicon), who are not immune either and have families etc.</p>
<p>That's just the man made world, the natural world even shows how we can't control a virus to a level that the naive believe; animals can be cross infected and essentially carry viruses with little to no ill effects.</p>

        <p>Because the entire point of the mask was to create an easily identifiable scapegoat so people don't question why they haven't been allowed to live like humans for a year.</p>
<p>And I've lost count of the number of politicians who have directly blamed "selfish" people for "making" them ratchet down the restrictions over and over.</p>

<p>I get your sentiment but don't necessarily agree. Internet access is an essential utility at this point - how many things have you learned by using a search engine or researching things online? Banning the internet for those that are in school is crazy.</p>
<p>Voting should be allowed when we consider someone an adult. The same age at which we should allow them to join the military, drink alcohol, etc. I just think it should be a consistent age when people can make all of these decisions instead of arbitrary for each one. But we have to decide what age makes someone an adult, whether 16, 18, 21, or 25.</p>

<p>Since they are "virtuous" and "caring", they don't have to be logical or abide by the rules of civility or decorum. The fault all lies with you.</p>

        <p>As I posted in another thread, it's insanity to think that a virus can be eradicated... we haven't gotten rid of influenza or even other coronaviruses, they make their way around seasonally and CV-19 will be added to the list of ones that do! Also, I think for that argument, what's funny is that the folks that wear masks and are against lockdowns are not the ones that are going to go get tested for the most part... the case numbers are what is driving the lockdowns so riddle me that batman!</p>

        <p>Cause theyre indoctrinated. They've been hammered with doom and gloom for 6 straight months by their schools and television.

        <p>It's really extreme virtue signaling. I have seen 2 types. Rich people who do anything they want and then wear a mask the rare times they are out with "the plebs". Then my favorite, the majority of them, the one I see the most as a programmer, the yuppie technocratic college grads. It's like a daily I Voted stickers, or daily instagram post about supporting black business (and then shutting them all down in lockdown ofc). The people who were never popular in HS but feel powerful with their elite degrees over "the sElfish idiOts from high school who can't give up going to Applebees" you know the ones who had halloween parties you didn't invited to recently. It is an extremely classist and elitist (often Napoleon) complex, thinking you know better than everyone and if all the plebs just listened to you they wouldn't be suffering. </p>
<p>I was shocked leaving Boston and seeing other cities, in states with mask mandates mind you, and almost NO ONE wearing them. These cities have one major difference, they are much poorer. These people got real world shit to do esp now that half of them lost their jobs. It's so sad seeing half the businesses closed, homeless people everywhere, and 1 in 5 people wearing masks as a mockery of their oppressors. Who the hell do they have to virtue signal to? If only they listened to their woke college grad masters then they wouldn't be on the street right!</p>

        <p>Simple answer MSM. This is who they look to as their new religion. </p>
<p>The premise behind this the same premise putting blame on how places opened up to soon. That premise is that the virus has climatic survivability vulnerabilities, like the Flu, where it has seasons. If people would have stayed locked up and masked, then the virus would have run it's course in the infected population, then the seasons would change and voila no more COVID, except that COVID has no climatic vulnerabilities making this premise completely invalid.</p>
<p>Just for the record Lord Fauci and the bought and paid for sciences, have repetitively made claims and then recanted those claims replacing with new ones, so it's the "baffle with bullshit" scheme running at full steam.</p>
<p>Lastly, all they need to do is infer something without actually stating it. People have descended into a deep psychosis where the pandemic has become their reality and they need to feed it to sustain this reality. The thought of the alternative is unfathomable which to justify the illogical perpetuation of the pandemic , they need to qualify how it can still be running rampant which requires blame and therefore it must be the COVIDiots causing this, not their new Gods or Religion. An example of inference is claiming how medical staff were "gagged" from exposing the truth on the horrendous conditions to prevent fear and panic....What lol? The inference being that COVID must really be the next Spanish Flu if they've gagged doctors and nurses from talking about it. Wow! what an ingenious fear campaign tactic just through inference.</p>

        <p>""Doomer"" here:</p>
<p>Curbing Covid19 spread is a team effort. In the same way vaccines are most effective when everyone has them, containing the virus is most likely to succeed when everyone adheres to the measures: mask-wearing, washing hands, social-distancing, etc.</p>
<p>If a sufficiently co-ordinated effort to stop this virus in its tracks existed, the rate of infection of Covid19 would be less than 1, meaning that tomorrow would have less new cases of infection than today. Eventually, the virus would peter out and be eradicated before everyone experienced contracting the virus.</p>
<p>This would've been best case scenario, and idealistic 13 year olds would be scratching their heads as to why everyone wouldn't aim for this gold standard.</p>
<p>Thing is, Fauci and the scientific community probably didn't think it would end before herd immunity precisely because such a co-ordinated effort was too idealistic to depend on.</p>
<p>Habits would be hard to break. Government messages would be confusing and unhelpful. Most unaffected areas would be apathetic to a threat they could not physically see. Well-meaning individuals would leave their noses uncovered or cough outside their mask, defeating their purpose.</p>
<p>And of course, government skeptics would reflexively reject any sort of mask-mandate and actively protest virus-containing measures. Historical precedence exists (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident">the Warcraft Corrupted Blood Incident is particularly humorous</a>) that dissuaded those in charge from expecting the populace from being able to maintain an effective quarantine.</p>
<p>And despairing redditors, looking for a scapegoat, found those proudly disregarding containment measures an easy target.</p>

        <p>How can you call it a team effort when the measures taken eliminated half the team? Shut downs wiped out 60% of the work force, put the remaining jobs in turmoil, increased homelessness by 1/3 and spread anxiety faster than the virus which puts literally everyone's mental health at risk. </p>
<p>What really bakes my noodle is the homeless community has faired very well in terms of avoiding infection. We hear nothing about their health in regards to Covid specifically which to me is incredibly telling. Viruses don't discriminate but in this case it avoids the poorest at least in the U.S.</p>

        <p>Because they can't even entertain the notion that "rules" from "authority" (career politicians) are ineffective at best.<br>
I'm guessing most of these people were the "well behaved" types in their school years, so the idea of "obey the rules and everything will work out" is thoroughly cemented - which also makes sense if the average "doomer" is well-off enough to isolate like a hibernating bear, but never bright enough to look beyond the next rung of perceived authority, or information pre-filtered and processed into narrative-aligned bite-size pieces.</p>

        <p>Honest question. Why do you think the pandemic will end once everyone wears a mask? No scientist is saying that.</p>
<p>You can argue that we’re causing excess deaths (we aren’t, but I’m not here to debate that with you), but it’s simply untrue to say the pandemic will be eradicated when people wear masks, because that would require a 100% compliance rate with a 100% effective face mask, neither of which exist.</p>
