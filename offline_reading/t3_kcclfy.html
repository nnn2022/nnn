    <strong>Thoughts on the idiots who keep telling us to wear a mask</strong>
    <p><p><em>Kind of a "shower thought" on the trolls that come here to tell we're dumb for not wearing masks, including (especially) on posts that have nothing to do with masks. As well as the mainstream media people that react to us in a similar way. I'd post it to r/showerthoughts but I don't feel like dealing with a tsunami of hate today:</em></p>
<p>You know, I finally figured out why the whole "you're an anti masker!" insult bothers me.</p>
<p>When it comes to actual government regulations around coronavirus, we're not told to "just wear a mask". We're told that socializing with anyone outside your house or "pod" (fuck, I hate that I've even heard of this concept) makes you an evil plague rat. That it's "selfish" to visit loved ones for Thanksgiving or dance and party with new people. All kinds of things like churches, gyms, salons, schools and libraries have been closed instead of opened with masks required.</p>
<p>But when someone protests the destruction of their business / main avenue for socializing / entire way of life? Suddenly, <em>then</em> it's about masks according to the mainstream media and the internet sjw crowd. <em>Then</em> it's somehow just that we're offended over a piece of cloth, haha, how silly!</p>
<p>Look: If I'd been told to <em>just</em> wear a mask from the start I would have been happy to do it! I would have visited my former "friend" with masks on both of us, instead of being told by her that wanting to visit under any conditions made me such a horrible person that she couldn't "in good conscience" be friends with me. I would have told people "big deal, it's just a piece of cloth". But instead, the piece of cloth got weighted with symbolic meaning: if you wore it where you weren't required to, it meant you agreed with the rest of the lockdown policies and the general social taboo against in person human interaction. It meant you agreed with the general view of other people as plague spreaders first and foremost. So I couldn't wear it to social events, because I would be signaling by doing so that I was "pro" everything I in fact hate. It would be like that scene in The Handmaid's Tale where two women are reciting canned pro-government phrases to each other, neither one knowing if the other was reciting them out of fear or out of true belief in the propaganda. And once someone who liked me with a mask on figured out I had anti-lockdown views / had gone to anti-lockdown protests / etc., they'd "cancel" me real fucking quick.</p>
<p>So it's kind of a laugh at this point to hear political commentators talk about how Biden is trying to "depoliticize" mask wearing. How can you "depoliticize" something that was used as a political cudgel from start to finish? And in such a dumb way, too. Because really, calling anti-lockdown people "anti-maskers" makes as much sense as calling feminism a movement about getting more social clout for "ugly fat lesbians".</p></p>

        <p>By and large, Reddit is a hive of weak, victim mentality sjw’s, so I really can’t take them seriously. I say inflammatory shit, and get insulted in return. Do I honestly care what some self righteous anti social purple haired pronoun obsessed person thinks of me? Not at all</p>

        <p>It is very interesting walking around outside that the following observation seems to hold:</p>
<p>Not all mask wearers have purple hair, but all the people with purple hair have masks on.</p>

        <p>Well put, it's NOT in this case a reasonably worn piece of cloth or whatever else they can be made of because there's many practical reasons to wear one but what is happening now is not one of them and I won't be wearing one ever for anything but an actual reason to do so. Not only is it a symbol of something I feel sick to my stomach even complying with for a trip inside a store never mind hours at work where it actually begins to make me ill. It's the  symbol of something that ruined almost my entire life with no hope of anything ever being given back. We are one more lockdown away from being finished for good, this was never about a virus. When it all first began it took just a couple trips out anyways as the first wave of hysteria was being pushed through to realize that no one was getting horribly ill and something else far more fishy was up.</p>
