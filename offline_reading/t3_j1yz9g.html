        <p>This is literally just a mainstream media spin term to collectivise and demonise a group of people who hold a variety of perfectly legitimate positions.  Ask yourself, where did this term come from?  Why do you just take it up?  Why is it assumed that "wearing masks" is somehow the 'default' position that those who don't want to (be forced to) wear them are somehow "anti" something.  Why don't you ask yourself, of those who demanded masks or mandated them, did they supply any scientific backing for their position?  Shouldn't that have been easy?  If there's good science showing that everyone wearing masks will make a significant impact, shouldn't they have published or cited this evidence?  The reality is that it does little in the way of reducing spread and more importantly - "mandatory" masks REQUIRES VIOLATING PEOPLE'S BASIC RIGHT NOT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO WEAR OVER THEIR FACE IN PUBLIC.</p>

        <p>Talking about MSM spin and made up terms designed to "other" and demonize those who go against the narrative, I've already started seeing reference to "refusers", meaning those who do not wish to be given an unproven vaccine, in certain articles.</p>

        <p>"Karen" also earlier on originally referred to someone who was obnoxious and demanding towards customer service people... but the MSM have spun that and now "Karen" is literally someone who wants to mind their own business and simply go about their lives without harassment from others.  There was a video on the 'Colbert Report' titled "Karen just wear the mask" showing clips of people having meltdowns in public over the masks.  Now in MOST of these cases these individuals were simply people who wanted to go about their lives, shop, and go home - but were then often confronted by mobs of people who won't mind their own business and go around 'policing' other people.  So they've basically inverted the term, which originally came from relatively powerless people (customer service employees) dealing with unreasonable customers - now it's used by the powerful (MSM elites) to attack the relatively powerless.</p>

        <p>I don't deny there is a virus but there is mounting evidence that the virus is not as deadly as they made it out to be, so much so that the restrictions don't make sense. the masks are a placebo at best it just makes people who are too terrified feel like something is  being done.</p>

        <p>We just want to be left alone and are suspicious how every argument we make to be left alone develops a counter argument that not only invalidates what we want but also makes us look like monsters for wanting to fight it.</p>
<p>"I don't want to wear a mask." = "The mask doesn't protect you it protects others."</p>
<p>Apparently the mask only works one way?</p>
<p>"I'm not sick though." = "You can't know that you can spread it asymptotically."</p>
<p>Which is an argument that popped up after everyone was locked down for months and were like, hey, it's been way more than two weeks, we should be all good right?  Nope!  Still not allowed to do anything no matter how long you sat in a room on your ever expanding ass and watching netflix.  The moment you go outside you are an incubator that must be restricted in everything you do.  Or you're killing grandma.</p>
<p>"Just stay home if you are vulnerable." = "EVERYONE is vulnerable."</p>
<p>Ignore all the data that anyone not already sick from something or overweight or extremely old come out of it just fine.  Which brings me to the next one.</p>
<p>"It's not that bad, you just get sick like from anything else and recover." = "People are getting permanent organ damage that can go away and come back leaving them handicapped for years if not permanently."</p>
<p>And this is something that just sounds unbelievable.  It just reads like horrific fearmongering.</p>
<p>"Kids aren't really affected by it and should be allowed to go back to school or do whatever they want." = "Kids can carry the virus in their nasal passages for weeks and spread it to their elderly family."</p>
<p>Again it sounds like horrific fearmongering.</p>
<p>Then on top of things like that we have the fact that we aren't allowed to go to work, to church, to school, to events, etc.  But riots go on unobstructed, political funerals are held with thousands in attendance, and it all comes off as even more politically motivated.</p>
<p>And finally there is the fact that we live in an age of surveillance where everything is constantly being documented and I have yet to see any video or images of people sick and dying in the streets, no homeless bums found on sidewalks choked to death by the horrors of the corona virus, no overflowing hospitals, no improvised quarantines stuffed with the sick and dying in paper gowns as doctors attend them in hazmat gear.</p>
<p>What we do see are tiktok nurses, bars demanding you wear a mask until you sit down, then joking with you about how they "don't serve corona haha" and then shouting you down if you dare to stand up without a piece of paper on your face.</p>
<p>All of this has turned into people who aren't sick, being afraid to spend time with other people who aren't sick, in places that aren't dangerous, because the media and government demand everyone act like everyone is sick at all times and people are going along with it because if they don't they are "killing grandma" and will be shut down or have their licenses pulled or fired or ostracized.</p>
<p>But the one thing that won't happen to them is that they won't get sick.</p>

        <p>Asymptomatic virus spread and mask usage reducing how much you spread sickness have been commonly known things since even before covid though, so I cant say those arguments come from covid. I'll agree that to I've seen a good bit of overexaggeration of the deadliness of this virus, but the mask itself working and a virus beung contagious before manifesting are just facts. While a virus is in your system, it needs time to reproduce and spread before it can really effect you, but depending where its origin point is, it can still be spread before it reaches that point. Again, all this info is pre-covid, since I too dont really trust latest sources</p>

        <p>Hey hey,</p>
<p>It’s not really about masks. Masks are easy to point a finger at and get worked up over. They’re annoying and being made to wear one is invasive but it’s small fry. There’s bigger long term problems. </p>
<p>Everyone being fed fear-porn and turning against each other as if your next door neighbour or family member you’ve known for years is a terrorist. </p>
<p>Public health statistics that really warrant deeper scrutiny, the pandemic isn’t the new Black Death, it’s pretty mild for the most part.</p>
<p>Coronavirus being a perfect health and safety excuse for governments spying on their citizens and taking away people’s right to protest and criticise - they’re always trying to do this.</p>
<p>Family businesses being forced to close and many never going to reopen afterwards, livelihoods being ruined. </p>
<p>Double standards for the rich and the peasants that only make the rich richer EDIT: hello global recession 2021</p>
<p>And the cherry on top is being told to like it and get used to it and never ask questions, as if you’re having a favour done for you.</p>

        <p>I apologize to anyone I have insulted by calling you an anti-masker. I’d just like to say that, as a high school student in a school with a regular schedule, it’s terrifying watching half my class drop like flies over the last few weeks, and having to suffer through a night of barely being able to breathe. Please at least recognize that the virus is real and it is dangerous, and mother doesn’t work in a hospital for hours on end trying to keep the virus patients alive for people to continue being ignorant and putting the entire population at risk. You can do whatever you want, but please be considerate</p>

        <p>I’m not an “anti masker”.  I’m just a moderate, Biden supporter who understands that there is no real consensus in the scientific community regarding efficacy of masks in reducing transmission of covid.  See Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, at the university of Minnesota, for a good discussion of same with citations to many studies concluding that masks don’t work:  <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data">here </a>.</p>
