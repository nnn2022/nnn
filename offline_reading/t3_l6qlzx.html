    <strong>Effectiveness of Masks</strong>
    <p><p>In the uk, there was some discussion for several months early last year where the conclusion was always that masks were almost entirely uneffective and this was the official standpoint of the WHO. 
Then, in July, a complete uturn and masks were made compulsory in public places. </p>
<p>The 1st virus was discovered in 1892. Stuck for any form of treatment for viral infections, there was a bit of a scandal a while back because doctors were handing out antibiotics, which wouldn't work at all on a virus. </p>
<p>Suddenly, in 2020, we "realised" that a tiny slip of paper or cloth was effective at preventing viruses from being spread.
Why didn't we discover this sooner? It's less complicated to invent than, say, the wheel. Millions of lives could have been saved over hundreds of years!</p></p>

        <p>Science you know, we have new science now. It doesn’t matter that after the mask mandates there’s been zero improvement, because science. Never question the Science.</p>
