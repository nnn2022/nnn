    <strong>The most optimistic outcome is not always the most likely, and vice versa</strong>
    <p><p>The future is always filled with uncertainty, and the coronavirus pandemic is no exception. I've been lurking on this sub for a couple of months now, and I've seen a lot of your predictions. I used to be a "doomer" myself, until I became dissatisfied with the way the other "doomers" have strayed away from the truth. And now, I am as disgusted with lockdown and similar public health measures as the next guy.</p>
<p>But I digress. During my long forays into this sub, I have seen a great deal of you believe that the public would quickly become fed up, lockdowns would dissipate, and we could see normalcy sooner than later; others, that leaders would extend public health measures for years, the mainstream media would keep pumping out fear-mongering, and the people would blindly obey like sheep. Who is right, and who is wrong? <strong>Is the tide turning for the better or for the worse?</strong> Unfortunately, as nobody is a prophet, we can't really tell until after the fact. However, as I have observed, <strong>the latter option seems more likely.</strong> How come?</p>
<p>I don't know whether I'm the first on this sub to be saying this; however, I've been wondering if our predictions have been misguided by optimism, a desire for this madness to end. Sick of the intense lockdown measures and absurd social distancing guidelines (not to mention the sheeple's willingness to comply), we've cast out dates, almost arbitrary, that could signal an end to this madness and a return to normal. Memorial Day, July 31st, Election Day, whenever the vaccine comes out. Will we return to "normal" in the span of a single day? As much as we wish we could, realistically, <em>no</em>. The fight will not end that quickly; the war we are waging is likely going to drag on for years, or even decades, and we can't even guarantee that we'll win every battle. We can cry out "NO NEW NORMAL!!!" for as loud and as long as we like, but at this point, "old normal" is a pipe dream. We are going to have to accept the fact that life after the pandemic will be significantly different from life before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Therefore, you see, I'd like to clear up something very important: <strong>outcomes that are more optimistic are not necessarily more realistic.</strong> Blissful ignorance, no matter how well-intentioned, is not going to get us anywhere. Coming up with such fantasies of returning to the lifestyle of 2019 might give ourselves more hope, but when we end up facing the inevitable truth, when those special dates come and go without life getting any better, we will end up traumatized and depressed. Therefore, I call on you all to adjust your expectations to a more reasonable level, and avoid magical thinking at all costs, so that we can have better chances in the long run.</p></p>

        <p>Well, you might have just solved a conundrum. The problem is that a good deal of the regular folk think it's going to end too. They're being optimistic. The problem is they are looking to a solution for a problem that doesn't (really) exist. They literally are the solution. Unlike China this lockdown starts and ends with them.</p>

        <p>&rt;The problem is they are looking to a solution for a problem that doesn't (really) exist. They literally are the solution. Unlike China this lockdown starts and ends with them. </p>
<p>The problem with our current society is that we are too afraid to stand up and defend our basic rights. I mean, we're making fun of each other for caring about "freedumbs" more than the "pandemic".</p>
<p>I have a feeling that each of us (both in the sense of lockdown skepticism and those in society as a whole who want the madness to end), comfortable as we might be re-examining the merits of lockdown, are too afraid to stand up and take action. I think what we're seeing here is a sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese">Kitty Genovese</a> effect: yes, more people might be waking up to the dystopia they themselves have created, however, as before, the same amount are doing nothing about it, thereby perpetuating it.</p>

        <p>Why are you getting all huffy with me? Staying hopeful helps me psychologically and isn't harming anyone. I'm not ready to "adjust my expectations," because that would signify giving up. I'd rather keep fighting.</p>
<p>Lashing out at people who don't agree with your position is straight from the New Normal playbook. Let's not go there. Let's not forget that we're all on the same team here, and supporting each other does more good than creating divisions.</p>

        <p>Petty psychological defense mechanisms aren't going to get you anywhere, you know. You can hide it all you want, but some day, the truth will have to come out, and you will be <em>very</em> disillusioned. More so, as a matter of fact, than you would be had you accepted your fate earlier.</p>

        <p>I 100% agree. I read posts of here that say things along the lines of “things in my area are getting better, there were people at the park/store/beach/wherever, not caring about masks or social distancing. The tide is turning” or “This will all go away on Election Day”.</p>
<p>The tide isn’t turning. There’s been people out at random times during this whole thing who haven’t cared about masks/social distancing at parks/beaches/stores, etc and sometimes they happen to show up in groups places, but it doesn’t mean things are changing. Sometimes, I hate to say this, but I wonder if people on this sub get outside. The reality I see outside says this isn’t going anywhere. That’s not being a doomer, it’s being realistic.</p>
<p>You’re right about dates too. Dates don’t matter. They could go on TV right now and say “this was all a hoax, we can all move on now” and people would still be obsessed with masks/lockdowns/social distancing. The way most people think has been reprogrammed and it’s not going to disappear in a day or even a year. We’re likely to see this play out for a generation or so, imo.</p>

<p>I often wonder this as well. It feels like gaslighting often, too. For months, I've been told that this will go away "soon", with the goalposts being shuffled constantly as well. Anytime I talk about how I see things getting worse than better, or go against the "optimism" spewed here, I get downvoted, sometimes attacked (passive-aggressively and not), and PMed messages about how my negativity will cause suicides, I am evil, that I'm a shill working for China, etc etc etc.</p>

        <p>They call it optimism, thus why I have it in quotations. Really, it's more like naivete, delusion, and also them trying to control the narrative for their own favored outcome (even though that's clearly not working). </p>
<p>There's a difference, a very stark one at that, between hoping for the best, and ignoring the facts to delude yourself and pretend things are going your way.</p>

        <p>Bingo! You just summed it up as well as I did! Like I keep saying, hopeless optimism won't get us anywhere. Too many people, I think, are stuck in denial.</p>

        <p>Yeah, unfortunately, I believe you are right. And I notice we are being downvoted. I suspect I know who it is that's doing it. It's sad that even our side is resorting to this same bullshit that the pro-lockdown/mask/New Normal people do.</p>

        <p>No? That doesn't even make sense since she accepts that things aren't returning to normal (albeit she is more pessimistic about it than even I am, but I can't blame her in the least because the situation isn't looking great right now).</p>
<p>I deleted that part because it is childish to call these people "nemesis" even though it sometimes feels like they are, despite being against the same injustice. Then again, I truly do feel like people here are incredibly hateful towards me, to the point where I've been told I am evil, and should leave the sub.</p>

        <p>I think people believe I take some sort of sick glee in "destroying optimism" when I don't. I just think people should stop being in denial of how bad the situation is. It feels like it is being downplayed as silly nonsense that will end "soon" (now the goalpost is the election in November). I think it's much more serious than that, and that you're right, I believe this is not going to go away anytime soon.</p>

        <p>I was always afraid of the consequences of the initial lockdown, thus why I made this account back then, to find info and try to talk sense into people. Didn't work. I've always felt that most people are stupid, and I was afraid that the initial lockdown would set a precedent, and we would likely not get our freedoms back easily. Nobody believed me back then, and told me to just shut up and watch Netflix. I was right, about the consequences sadly. </p>
<p>I am desperately trying to live my life to the best of my ability (advice often given to me here) but it's difficult because everything I once loved is either gone or changed for the worst. Walking in a mall has been less than enjoyable because of the fear and panic. Seems like there are some people out and about (though it <strong>is</strong> less than average) but thye are terrified, nearly every time I am out, I will get no less than five people who will actively jump away or scurry off if I get too close. Parents tugging along their very miserable masked kids and babies. People driving or walking by themselves with masks on. Lately, people are now bitching at others for not standing in the designated circles for "social distancing". It's been awful, and I fear life being like this forever, and even if it's not, I feel like my opinion of people as a whole is lower than ever. It's getting difficult to feel anything other than morose or just plain angry anymore. All of my progress from 2018-2019, physically and emotionally, have been ruined, and while I am trying to regain it, it hasn't happened yet.</p>

        <p>I'd love to be optimistic as well. </p>
<p>Back in late March, when people assured me that this would be over by Easter, and people would not allow the lockdown to continue because of a holy holiday, I did feel some relief. I was like, "They're right. This isn't going to last. It's not two weeks, but maybe just a month." ...Yeah, they were wrong. Then when the goalpost shifted to "Nobody's going to wear masks in the summer heat", I was like, "...True. Who's going to willingly wear a mask when it's 90 degrees?" WRONG AGAIN. Deep down, I felt like they were wrong, but I tried to believe them, and have "faith in humanity". But no, this misplaced optimism is just that. Right now, people are terrified. People here don't believe me when I say that PA is full of fear or that everyone is gung-ho about the "New Normal". I feel some despair because I feel like a lone voice in a sea of "shut the fuck up, you liar/evil bitch/doomer/(whatever)", same when I'm the one person not wearing a mask outdoors or doing something else that goes against the grain in real life. Hell, I even talked about it yesterday, about how not wearing mask doesn't make the difference people here claim it does, and the comment got downvoted. Of course.</p>

        <p>I'll neither deny the most probable outcome (like the effects of 9/11) nor stop fighting against it.  But I've been doing that since I first voted Libertarian 20ish years ago so I'm used to it.</p>
<p>Being a skeptic easily puts me in the "Cancel" group so I tread lightly but consistently push back.  I wont do Masks in public/business (in a mandatory state) but won't argue against a business that requests me to leave.  I work for doomers so I just post facts or ask questions anonymously whenever I can.  I got them to respond with the "seat belt" and "drink driving" group think response (they really are full on doomers).  I've made sure my kids know they have near zero risk.  I do take down signs at parks.  Etcetera.</p>
<p>If I was single (or old enough to not GAF anymore), I assure you I'd be significantly more brazen.</p>

<p>That's one of the problems. Many of us have families, so it's tougher for us to rebel without risking collateral damage. And believe me, people are becoming more radicalized, and therefore, more violent and malicious. The sad thing is that most of the youth, the ones who would be more brazen and fight for rights, seem to be either apathetic or support the New Normal.</p>

I think the cut-off age for military enlistment in the US is 28 (not sure on this) or so. </p>
<p>It's also why I get frustrated when people here say to "just move lol" as if it's easy to just pack up and move for anyone and everyone. Those of us who are married, and especially with kids, can't just uproot their lives that easily, not without much planning and also money and job stability.</p>

        <p>Same with us. We have three boys so we have been teaching gun safety, cleaning and proper training in all our firearms. Learning how to load mags too. I don’t care how people feel about this because for one it teaches them to be safe around firearms and it helps pass the time lately. My husband and I both want to do more and we know a few others but same boat with kids and not sure exactly what we should do. I think we would need large numbers and become more organized. It’s getting that done that’s the problem.</p>

<p>I respect that others feel this is an unchangeable situation, because we are all seeing different things where we live, in our industries, and among our contacts. I don't hold the same view, but we are all frustrated and hurting.</p>

        <p>You know why? It's because of the inherent flaws in Reddit's upvote/downvote system. A lot of people, probably even you, are thinking, "OMG, charizardmewtwo's such a doomer. It'll <em>obviously</em> end on Election Day! Why the hell would this fucktard go around advocating for <em>accepting</em> the new normal on r/NoNewNormal, of all subs?"</p>
<p>Jesus, did you even read the post? I'm not a "doomer", I'm a realist. A lot of times, members of anti-lockdown subs have conflated the <em>ideal</em> scenarios with those that are most <em>likely</em> to occur; hence, I posted here to correct this.</p>

        <p>I am sometimes guilty of the stupid voting system on Reddit but I try my best to not use it. I actually don’t think you are a doomer at all, I myself feel I’m a bit of a realist and have seen this shit happening for a long time, maybe not this fucking pandemic but whats been going on in education and the country. I’ve been called a pessimist my entire life but I don’t feel I am all the time, I just see what’s going on. Or shit, maybe I don’t. Who even fucking knows anymore. I know that I’m preparing for the worst and I don’t give a fuck what people think about it. I have also realized we may have to play along with the new normal bullshit to change anything or break away completely which maybe where the country is headed.</p>

        <p>The issue I have is that pessimistic views, even if they are arguably more realistic, do nothing to inspire the change we want to see. There's nothing to take action over with this kind of pessimism, other than to try to wear down the optimists and make them give up. I'm not interested in giving up. I'm not an idiot, I know a lot of things aren't coming back--my family's entire industry is in the process of dying. But I guess I would rather go down fighting it, especially if we are going lose. Why make it easier for them to muzzle us? </p>
<p>If, as those in this thread are saying, that it's inevitable, then it shouldn't matter whether I have hope or not. What exactly will adjusting my views downward accomplish other than to make it easier for me to be rolled into the new regime? What would be the point in that? My mental health is already shot, so it can't be about preserving that.  </p>
<p>My continued hope that we can change the course of this nightmare will not actively harm your ability to be a realist, so I see no benefit for our side if I change my outlook. It will only benefit the other side.</p>

        <p>Yes, now for the naively optimistic it’s “this will all end after November,” as if the global assault on human life revolves around the US election. This mentality is simply a way to remain passive and avoid confronting the gravity of this situation. That only leaves one vulnerable and weak when things don’t get better. A savior isn’t coming and clearly things aren’t going to go back to normal in their own. We have to figure out ways that we as individuals can actively work towards resisting tyranny. That’s the only chance we have of restoring normalcy.</p>

<p>Tell that to all those who have said "social distancing HAS to be temporary because humans can only stay isolated for so long because they're human". Uh, as long as the governments are on a power trip, no.</p>

<p>I think Florida, Texas and Arizona will drop to almost nothing soon. Perhaps it will provoke some envy.</p>

        <p>Even when they drop like a stone the media won't report it, as it is not in their interest to not stoke the fires of hysteria and death. Notice the focus on cases as deaths have dropped considerably. Government tyrants still scream about lockdowns and keeping shit closed indefinitely.</p>

        <p>There's even articles about how the case rate is also dropping in places like NJ, yet they continue to somehow spin that into fearmongering. I wish I was kidding, but that's how the media is operating right now, and people need to stop being in denial about how evil the governments and media are being. This is not a bunch of naive people not "understanding" the virus, these are malicious monsters at work ruining lives.</p>

        <p>Oh, hands down, that is totally true.  China is behind all of this 100%.  The governors and other members of government here in the US are being duped by China's social media army as much as anyone else.</p>
<p>EDIT:  To clarify (because I have the feeling I will need to to stop downvotes) I'm not a "hoaxer", I don't think it's all made up by China or developed in a lab.  I mean that the <em>response</em> (lockdowns, pushing masks, etc.) has been driven by China from the start and they are still helping to push it through social media today.</p>

        <p>I’m a natural pessimist and even I would love some hope, but I’ve been saying from the beginning this shit isn’t a normal response and I felt something was very wrong. Now people even the sheep are openly on board with the great reset and the NWO I really believe nothing is going back to normal ever. There will be a new normal and we have decide if we are going to participate. I for one don’t want to and would rather barter and trade with other like minded people. There are some very scary ideas floating around of utopia and transhumanism and I believe we are being pushed in this direction. It all screams RUN AWAY to me.</p>

        <p>There is legit nowhere else on Reddit (except kinda sorta /r/endthelockdowns but that sub is specific to the lockdowns as well) people can go to vent about the direction things are going. Even LDS is currently not allowing posts to get made on this sort of subject outside of the megathreads, which are often brigaded by "optimists" and also trolled by the pro-lockdown crowd as well (the mods don't seem to monitor those megathreads much, by my observation), plus they are outright banning any and all discussion on masks, the possibility of a "New Normal", and anything they deem to be a "conspiracy" (such as the vaccine's faultiness). You may not like seeing "unpleasant" posts like this, but do you honestly believe the solution is to further censor our side, and only allow positivity?</p>

        <p>That's fair. But a poster in this thread lashed out at me for saying that I choose to be optimistic for my psychological health, and that's not OK with me. We all have different psychological structures, and a coping strategy that harms one person may help another. Besides, the pro-lockdown crowd has sneered and jeered at us enough; we shouldn't be doing the same among ourselves.  </p>
<p>Edited to add: I see you told that poster to tone it down. Thank you.</p>

        <p>I agree entirely. <em>Mod hat on</em> I warned the poster who lashed out at you. <em>Mod hat off</em></p>
<p>I don't like the pessimism wave that's washing across us either. It's counter productive to our cause. That said, I do feel strongly that we should not stifle voices simply because we disagree.</p>

        <p>Of course. People have the right to express their pessimism as noisily as they wish. But forcing it on others runs counter to the spirit of this sub.</p>
<p>Edited to add: When I said "forcing it on others," I was referring to a poster lashing out at me for choosing to maintain some optimism. I see that a mod has deleted the post in question. I never have a problem with respectful disagreement.</p>

        <p>Nobody is "forcing it on others". If you don't like posts and comments like this, you can easily avoid them. But I see you engage in arguments with others whose "doomerism" you disagree with.</p>
