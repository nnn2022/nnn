    <strong>Anti maskers why is wearing a mask the line in the sand you draw for in the fight against the New World Order?</strong>
    <p><p>Look I think fighting the lockdowns is logical. I think not wanting this vaccine is logical but I don't get why the mask thing is such a red line.</p>
<p>Obama signed the NDAA. Bush the Patriot act. Both these things took away our rights.</p>
<p>Little kids have been getting bombed for decades now. </p>
<p>Cameras are everywhere. The masks even help fool the A.I cameras.</p>
<p>I don't want a new normal either and I am thankful for this sub reddit but wearing a mask is so easy so helpful why not do it to help stop the spread?</p></p>

        <p>Very good answer but what about the other things in my post?</p>
<p>Why no massive protests or movements when Bush signed the Patriot act or Obama the NDAA.</p>
<p>Why no protest against Trump for spending and droning more than Obama?</p>
<p>Why this and not those?</p>
<p>Why not every maga head demands non stop Trump pardons Assange and Snowden?</p>

        <p>True good point. I hate feeling powerless I do. I am not going lie. The day Assange goes to prison in the us I am going to break down and cry. I protested for him I been to so many protests for so many things but nothing changes. I wish all the maga people who tweet trump non stop to free him.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I hate trump is he said "We love wikileaks" Wikileaks que es that mi amigo yo no si nada pedo tacos y burritos vato"</p>
<p>Dude stabbed Assange in the back</p>
<p>RIP Seth Rich Free Assange</p>

        <p>Your argument is basically "others took away rights through bullshit reasoning and straight up lying, why you got a problem with it happening more?"</p>
<p>Masks don't work and when people claim they do despite clear widespread evidence they don't, it breaks down legitimate science and health messaging even further and gives the government a blank check to lie about other things and people will blindly accept it</p>

        <p>I've protested <strong>every single thing</strong> OP listed. </p>
<p>Masks are line in the sand for most people because it is now in their "bubble". When the government is literally taking away your right to breathe, visit family, or make a living.</p>
<p>This is just one example, there are many others (it's the same playbook). Why are pro-mask people allergic to history?</p>
<p>https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/antisemitic-legislation-1933-1939</p>
<p>"The first major law to curtail the rights of J citizens was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service of April 7, 1933, which excluded Jews and the “politically unreliable” from civil service. The new law was the German authorities' first formulation of the so-called Aryan Paragraph, a regulation used to exclude Jews (and often, by extension, other “non-Aryans”) from organizations, professions, and other aspects of public life. This would become the foundation of the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935, which defined Jews <strong>not by religious belief but by ancestral lineage</strong> and which formalized their segregation from the so-called Aryan population."</p>

<p>Why wouldn't something stopping your spit from flying work?</p>

        <p>OK good answer but if we all fought it or every maga supported blasted trump non stop on social media and crashed interviews on the street demanding he pardoned snowden and assange we could make a change.</p>
<p>It's just strange to see so many people fighting masks but not those things.</p>
<p>How hard it it to tweet at the president Pardon Assange or you lose my vote. If Half his supporters had done that maybe Assange wouldn't be where he is</p>

        <p>Yes it does if the study is correct. Someone else tore it apart so I can't use it now but if your spit spreads Covid and a masks stops most of your spit wouldn't it stop you from giving Covid to others?</p>

        <p>I’ll ask you again, does this piece of associational piece of epidemiology prove causation of myself causing any harm to another, yes or no? If yes, please provide the text in reply to mine that proves that.

        <p>The study says that Covid spread was cut down by 20% by wearing masks If this is true than yes you are harming people but I didn't look at the dates and someone seems to have debunked it. Maybe I am wrong but I think you should also consider the fact that you maybe wrong</p>
<p>A mask stops spit from flying. Spit spreads the virus. To me it makes sense</p>

        <p>I'll ask a third and final time. Yes or no: does this single piece of <em>associative</em> <em>epidemiology</em> definitively prove your claim that being maskless is the <em>direct</em> <em>causality</em> of any harm? As an aside, if this piece of epidemiology shows a correlation, yes or no: does that in and of itself invalidate my rights over my own personhood and rights over my own body?</p>

<p>My point is the system has taken away all our rights already and few said anything. </p>
<p>Few stood up for Assange no one stopped up to the Patriot act etc but now this simple thing of wearing a mask is the red line?</p>

        <p>Ok that is a good point. I think trapping the bacteria is the point. You don't spread it to others.</p>
<p>Wearing masks won't stop you from getting it. It will cut down how much you give others.</p>
<p>My mask request if I had power would be like this</p>
<p>Hey everyone can you please please wear a mask we won't force you but it would really really help and we could fight this thing and if we do it from the start we might not even need a vaccine and you don't have to wear it when no one is around just at the store or in crowds but if you are jogging by yourself don't worry. </p>
<p>That is how it should have been done</p>
<p>Don't forget Dr Fauci lied to us and said masks didn't work when this started and if he had told the truth and we wore masks from the start maybe we would be in a better place</p>

<p>Every time you exhale or even move there is bacteria being spread around you and being inhaled.</p>
<p>In a surgical setting where everything is sterile, and individuals are trained on proper mask use, absolutely masks work.</p>

        <p>On your broader point, the reason i think masks are the kine in the sand is because its such an obvious intrusion into our lives.</p>
<p>We can be lied to about weapons of mass destruction, and the extent of government surveillance on private citizens. Hell most people still believe the Patrioti Act was 100% necessary.</p>
<p>This defies all logic, and is government mandated virtue signaling to weed out the non-believers.</p>

        <p>You know what. You are 100% right and that is why it sucks asking people to wear masks. The very same people saying wear a mask tried to disarm us lied about all you said protected oil companies. Michele Obama and Jimmy Kimmel licked Bushes boots in Public so I get it Cry wolf right.</p>
<p>This is just my view but I think masks work and if those monsters had not lied maybe people would believe me</p>

        <p>It's public, and from all research I've done, I'm not harming anyone.  I'm not sick, I'm not spreading disease, and the masks haven't been shown to be effective outside of a lab setting anyway.</p>
<p>I imagine most of us drew our lines far before masks, refusing to distance, hide from families and friends, stay inside, keep our kids from being kids, etc., but, and this is the point, broadly no one noticed.</p>

        <p>I haven't read that study yet, but given the increase in cases in the fall being pretty similar in much of the world, within the confines of what we can actually conclude given the terrible quality of data and lack of comparability, the idea that masks have impacted these curves at all is a very tough sell.  Getting a quality seal even with trained individuals, quality masks, clean-shaven faces, and brand new masks is extremely challenging.  (Periodic fit tests with N95s and SCBA masks, the latter of which are far superior for a seal and even then require training, sizing, fit, shaves, testing, and some control over one's facial expressions...and still don't contain a sneeze.)</p>
<p>And yes, I object to all intrusions in to our personal space, autonomy, freedom, etc. (this includes the various computer laws passed to limit freedoms and increase surveillance, and of course the DMCA Biden was key in instrumenting.)  The security theater at airports of asking 80yos to remove their shoes because one guy, one time, FAILED to implement a bomb there is absurd.  It wasn't to protect anyone then, it was just to make people FEEL safe, and that's all the hygiene theater is for now.  We know how much got through the increased screening, but that wasn't the point then, and isn't now.</p>
<p>I've had covid already, my whole family has.  I can't infect you with that, but I can help spread colds, which we all need for the sake of our immune systems.  We're almost all healthier if we spread colds with wild abandon.  It probably even makes covid cases milder.  Those too vulnerable to survive a cold need to protect themselves, but the rest still need to be exposed, for whatever the next big cold or flu is.</p>

        <p>Getting diseases is the ONLY way our immune systems work.  Vaccines fake it enough to provoke an immune response, but the same pathways are triggered one way or another.  The goal is to get exposed to as much as possible, safely, so we're prepared for both those diseases and other similar ones.  Both antibodies and tcells are designed to cross-react.  (This goes wrong when they're attacking things that aren't real diseases (allergies), or something that's in us all the time (autoimmune).  Roughly.)  If you watch people who work with young kids, they start off getting sick all the time, then very little any more.  Young parents, teachers, pediatricians/nurses tend to have extremely effective immune systems.</p>
<p>No clue on whether it will be "required" but I'll fight it in any way I can.  I'm not getting my kids injected with something so new, so experimental, when the risk of the disease to them is essentially nil.  They've had MMR vaccines, polio, even varicella, and usually get flu vaccines, but covid is milder than ALL of those for kids, and there's so much in-the-wild beta testing going on for this vaccine.  Mandatory vaccines are another way the government shouldn't be intruding on our lives, especially with the history of rushed vaccines like swine flu, anthrax, even smallpox.</p>

        <p>I'm against all of the things you listed, but especially masks. They do nothing to "slow the spread" and AI has evolved to the point now where they only need to pick up your movements and gait, not actually see your face so they do very little to actually "fool" the cameras. But, to answer your question of why people didn't draw the line at earlier infringements, those things, while terrible, generally didn't impact the day-to-day lives of people like forcing someone to put something on they don't want to do in order to access basic services.</p>
<p>edit: also all of this is predicated on this being an EMERGENCY when there is obviously no emergency. If a virus that has a survival rate of 99.8%+ is considered an emergency, then literally anyhting can be considered on.e</p>

        <p>Ok you have a great answer. I get the survival rate is really high and I am not taking the vaccine at all and they should have locked up the old and the sick not healthy people but people are dying and Covid is hurting people. 2 million have died world wide. Hospitals are overflowing. </p>

<p>I know CNN lies and I will not take the Vaccine but a mask stops your spit from flying and it's so easy to wear.</p>

        <p>AI cameras now have the opportunity to train themselves in a new way with large datasets so I don't think that is the problem, but to answer your first question...</p>
<p>They started pushing these so hard so early contrary to any recommendations, studies or anything. There was no evidence they worked. Slowly, studies started coming saying that maybe they do work, but not taking into account spread from handling them, washing hands and how long they were used before thrown out or washed.</p>
<p>There has been absolutely no evidence that cases have slowed down since the mandate, and even before the mandate, at least in my area 90% of people appeared to be wearing them.</p>
<p>I am so against masks because they are ground zero for all of this bullshit. Other than the mainstream media, masks are the #1 thing reminding people COVID exists. If masks were gone, most people wouldn't even realize this thing even exists. If the government admits that masks didn't make a difference, everything else will crumble too and this whole charade will be over.</p>
<p>If they can require you to wear something and everyone agrees with me, what else can they require you to do? ANYTHING.</p>

        <p>Thank you for answering. I will look into the A.I thing you said. </p>
<p>But at first Dr Fauci said not to wear masks and he was lying. He even admitted he was lying. They tried keeping masks away from us at first. </p>
<p>The masks aren't ground zero though. The Patriot act is the NDAA is the wars are the Fed reserve is. That's my point. The N.W.O didn't start with masks so why are masks the red line but no Maga person was at a anti fed reserve or anti war rally?</p>
<p>They already have us doing anything. You knell for the anthem and say maybe  I don't always like what our troops are ordered to do the right cancels you</p>
<p>You say maybe Russia didn't help trump the left cancels you.</p>
<p>We are already slaves in so many ways so why is wearing masks the red line?</p>
<p>I have a study here that says masks work</p>
<p>https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/12/02/2015954117</p>
<p>I disagree with the thinking that if people didn't see masks there would be no pandmic. Covid is real and it is killing people. Maybe it's not as bad as the media says but it is bad</p>

        <p>&rt; The masks aren't ground zero though. The Patriot act is the NDAA is the wars are the Fed reserve is. That's my point. The N.W.O didn't start with masks so why are masks the red line but no Maga person was at a anti fed reserve or anti war rally?</p>
<p>I am Canadian. I have always been left leaning. I have always thought Trump was an idiot. I don't know anything about patriact acts, ndda, etc. I do know that this obsession with masks is effecting the entire world, every single person is being directly effected.</p>
<p>I personally hold the opinion, this has NOTHING to do with right vs left. There are tons of pro mask conservatives and tons of anti mask liberals. It has been politicized which makes it appear that way, but I would have been against this no matter what and I think lots of people from both sides feel the same and are finding common ground.</p>
<p>People call me a conspiracy theorist, white wing neo nazi, etc - because this is what the media has labeled anyone who questions the covid reponse. I am a person that has NEVER held any conspiracy theories or strong political leanings.</p>
<p>To your final statement, do a search for deaths per year in each country for the last 10 years. Now, take into account PCR false positives (minimum 2% under ideal conditions), and the fact that a covid death actually means somebody who tested positive for COVID before or after death. </p>
<p>Is it before death, or after? Is it one week before or a month before? Would they have died that month anyway? What about the false positive deaths? Interesting questions that are not clearly reflected in the stats.</p>
<p>So take that deaths are "deaths with covid", not "from covid", our yearly death count doesn't look alarming, all mainstream news outlets are pushing "hospitals are being overloaded" as hard as they can, yet the people who actually work at those hospitals say they are normal for the year and the public isn't aware how overloaded hospitals routinely get during flu season...</p>
<p>So from my perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media is hyping fear and using misleading statistics on a regular basis</li>
<li>Media says hospitals are overloaded that are PROVEN not to be. (I'm not saying this is true for all of them, but it is for many)</li>
<li>Government / media is ignoring and downright censoring ALL OTHER COLLATERAL DAMAGE from lockdowns</li>
<li>It was common knowledge in 2018 that masks DON'T work.</li>
</ul>
<p>So all of a sudden they start hyping masks and saying how much they work before ANY studies are made. Now studies are starting to pop up, but being that they were SO SURE masks work before any studies were even done, that would lead me to believe we have people with special interest running these studies, and to ignore this as a possibility is willful ignorance. Highest bidder pushes a study to get the result they want.... but that aside, the mask studies are not compelling at best, and there are also studies that argue the contrary. Why are they SO important.</p>
<p>Why is distancing in packed stores not enforced when distancing UNARGUABLY works better than masks, yet outdoor restaurants are closed?</p>
<p>Why is there so much censorship if you say ANYTHING against the covid response</p>
<p>There are SO MUCH LIES, SO MUCH FEAR MONGERING, SO MUCH MISINFORMATION WORLDWIDE that why in the world would I trust a single mandate?</p>
<p>I see 90% of people wearing these things before the mandate. Why do we need a mandate if compliance is already so high? Why isn't distancing in packed stores enforced? </p>
<p>WHY ARENT THE DEATH COUNTS ACTUALLY HIGH?</p>

        <p>They're forcing direct participation. I didn't like the Patriot Act either and didn't support it, but they weren't trying to force me to spy on people myself. Now they're interfering directly in our day-to-day lives, with no indication that they're ever going to stop and roll it back and plenty of past experience showing rollbacks are a rarity.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if it's easy or not - and anybody who works a physically intensive job knows that wearing a mask isn't really that easy. Especially for women and old men. The mandates are a much bigger burden to blue collar workers than to the shoppers putting a mask on at Whole Foods once a week for half an hour. The whole point, though, is boiling the frog. Slowly add restrictions and mandates so that getting angry about any particular one can be framed as an overreaction, even though what we're really doing is drawing a line and pointing out that there have been many small losses of freedom and we're not tolerating any more.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the answer it is a great one. </p>
<p>The Patriot act was totally forced participation. We have to be spied on. We have to have our rights our privacy stolen. It may not seem like a day to day thing but it is</p>
<p>I agree that the state and libs should go easy on people who have a legit hard time wearing masks. </p>
<p>Speaking of blue collar people being told what to do by those who don't do it themseleves did you see Sasha Obama dancing maskless on tic tok with all her friends?</p>

        <p>Masks are not evidence supported and don't work. We have a lot of evidence to that effect and garbage evidence used to mandate it</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Danish Mask study, the world's only RCT on this topic, found no effect whatsoever</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The literature on masking for influenza-type illness has never supported masking in any RCT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some evidence even suggests cloth masks increase disease by breeding bacteria once they get moist</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sars-cov-2 particles are too small for the weave of any mask</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Across the world there's no clear association between masking and "reduced rates" at all. The studies commissioned to support mask use simply stop after the summer (seasonal) decline in disease</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monica Gandhi's dose-dependent argument about covid isn't borne out by the data at all. Masks are not turning people into asymptomatic cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most evidence used in support is observational garbage where everyone was forced to wear a mask without controls and the authorities conclude dumbly "that must work"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The animal study evidence is also garbage with small sample sizes and non-human anatomy (hamsters don't touch their masks lol). Same goes for lab studies, in real life normies are not practicing mask hygiene and the particle flow is still sufficient to infect </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Masks are not "fooling cameras", they're being used to help train them to ID masked individuals currently</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So no, every single aspect of the mask story is wrong and the fact that it is mandated shows this whole damn thing is politics playing medicine. If we let them do this and get away with it they can do anything under false pretenses</p>

        <p>Yeah, I have been arguing with people using these citations so much I was just getting tired of posting them. One sec</p>
<p>Danish study https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/do-masks-stop-the-spread-of-covid-19-</p>

<p>Dose-dependent theory is garbage https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/11/confronting-notion-face-masks-reduce-covid-dose. Also talks about the observational and animal studies</p>
<p>good youtube presentation that changed my mind initially https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RaBLKKXJt4</p>

        <p>First its the masks, then its the vaccines, before you know it we'll have chips in our arms in order to buy groceries. The reason I fought it for so long is because the government is basically convincing everyone that they are sick, it's not healthy to think like that, and IMO wearing a mask triggers that anxiety. I know when I'm sick, my body tells me that, so if that's the case I stay home, common sense. No body should be forced to wear something that inhibits your breathing either.</p>

        <p>Because we can.  I couldn't stop Dubya signing the Patriot act- I wrote him and all three of my Congressmen; it did nothing.  I couldn't stop Obama signing ANY of the awful things he signed- I wrote him and all three of my Congressmen; it did nothing.  I can't take down cameras (well, I <em>can</em>, but they'll just be put back up; I can't make them go away).  I can't stop military interventions or mass humanitarian crises in other parts of the world.  But I can do this.  Why?</p>
<p>Because I want the lockdowns to end.  Because "stopping the spread" is a BAD thing.  The pandemic ends when herd immunity is achieved, not before.  Herd immunity only gets achieved through exposure.  Vaccines take time to develop and YEARS to test properly; almost everyone is a LOT safer risking the disease.  Some aren't; let them hunker down and take cover.  And if you're willing to take the risk- "willing", remember that word?  I'm not forcing anyone to do anything- go out and risk infection.  Take a chance and do something heroic.</p>
