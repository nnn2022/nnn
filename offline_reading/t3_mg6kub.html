    <strong>Danger of vaccine passports</strong>
    <p><p>hello everyone,</p>
<p>I'd just like to share one of my thoughts with you.</p>
<p>We've all heard about the vaccine passports by now, but seems like people think it would only be for covid vax, but in my opinion it wouldn't end there.</p>
<p>Once their would introduce these passports and people wouldn't reject it on mass, then I wouldn't be surprised if they'd use these passports to force upon us new vaccines every year. You'd one day get a notification "new vaccine required, visit your doctor in next 14 days in order to keep your passport working".</p>
<p>And who knows what all these vaccines would do to people? Make you infertile, shorten your life, get you all kinds of chronic diseases so the pharma have lifetime customers... you name it.</p>
<p>Be warned, reject the vaccine passports as if your life depends on it.</p>
<p>Bless You All,
stay strong.</p></p>

        <p>In America here they're issuing vaccination cards for people to carry as "proof." Despite my best efforts to stop them, my mother and sister lined up like lemmings to get the vaccine and have been issued these, now tagged and marked as part of the machine.</p>
<p>As of now these aren't used for anything specific that I'm aware of, but you KNOW where this is headed.</p>
<p>They can take their cards and shove them up their asses. They won't get me. Under no circumstances will I get their gene-therapy vaccine. Bar me from all of society. I'm done with this subverted futuristic shithole anyway.</p>

        <p>I was talking about the digital passports in form of an phone app.</p>
<p>Which would last probably just till people start complaining that they can't get into places when their phone die or they forget it at home.</p>
<p>Which is when they'd introduce another very clever solution - here, let's just microchip everybody, the chip won't die and you won't forget it at home, just don't cut off your hand and you can go wherever.</p>

        <p>That's even worse. Haven't heard of any phone app shit here yet, just the cards. I figured this would progress to "digital certificates" and then to microchips.</p>

        <p>Thanks for showing me. I wasn't aware that it has evolved so hideously, but I don't keep up with this like I used to. It makes me angry and I know it's a lost cause at this point anyway so I just tune it out. I already vowed total and complete defiance no matter what.</p>
<p>But this digital passport thing is an abomination. They can get fucked. Luckily this won't pass in America like it might with the Euro-cucks. Our no-nonsense boys down south and out in Texas would take care of it quickly. Or it will end with several states' secession, and I'd attempt to move as a domestic "refugee."</p>
<p>And this also is why we should be careful. This virtual passport is too obviously blunt for America. They'll try something much more subtle and insidious so that one day we all just wake up in chains under medical tyranny.</p>

<p>So serious question how exactly do you post on reddit?  Do you use a phone?  If so you are already "tagged and marked" the government can pull gps data on you at any time.  Probably should go live in the woods and stop interacting with people online :)</p>

<p>Yes by using phones we are basically tagged. Is that a reason for EVEN more privacy breaching and government/corporate control over citizens?? What is your reasoning here? I dont get it!</p>

        <p>Well you are right, with phones we already give "them" enormous loads of sensitive data of ourselves.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<p>Also with banking cards, we theoretically are easily trackable: Wherever you pay or take out cash, it will be noted where you were when, how much money you used, and potentially what you did with that money. That is already a lot of control, or surveillance, but luckily there is cash. Are you pro digital-currency-only? Or are you okay/glad that we can use cash?</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>The vaccine itself of course does nothing specific, but the vaccination process APPEARS to become a requirement to enter certain planes, events or stores. Maybe. Its something many are scared about. Having a digital vaccine passport as an app that just records which vaccine you got and that smartly recommends you when to get the next one on a voluntary basis is one thing.</p>
<p>But developing this app into a requirement for entrance somewhere - makes its use already a bit less voluntar. , and at some point becoming an app that centralizes all sorts of your health data is even worse. what if the app only lets you into certain stores/events if you take certain meds or vaccines regularly? if the vaccine is only effective for 6 months arent you at some point forced to get vaccinated every 6 months etc? just to grab a beer with friends? what if you are vaccinated but still sneezing coughing due to something else. can you still enter the plane? but you could infect people with something when you cough! </p>
<p>centralizing health data can in the worst case affect your life like: "oh you have asthma? we will have to make your insurance nore expensive then, unfortunately" </p>
<p>this is very exaggerated, but i hope i made my point clear</p>
<p>segregating the population due to their "health status (aka something their "health app" says") is highly unethical and undemocratic. there is enough division and segragation already. we need less, not more.</p>
<p>and yes, phones are a Problem. would be nice to see more campaigns about privacy protections</p>

        <p>Phones literally can't function as they do currently without gps chips.  If you want the comforts of modern society you kind of need to deal with stuff like location services.  Kind of hard to give directions to the concert if your phone has no idea where it is same with cars.  I don't understand the worry over this because frankly our political system in general is too divided to make actual use of the data.  Now if you were in China and part of the Uighurs then I could see the worry.  Personally I primarily use a cc and keep some cash for emergencies only.  Cash isn't actually backed by anything physical at this point you do know that right?  We haven't been on the gold standard for years.  </p>
<p>The only way to actually be off the grid is to literally be off the grid that means no internet no phone no official place of residence that is recieving bills.  Now in the future if the parties ever unite that might something to worry about but right now I have one relative who died from covid a friend who has significant long term effects post recovery that haven't dissipated and an immunocompromised mom who I am extremely worried about getting it.  Please don't start off with doctors lied stuff multiple good people in my extended family are doctors and I've seen them looking like death warmed over from dealing with this awfulness.   If you don't believe that deaths are due to covid and therefore a vaccine isn't needed give another explanation for the massive spike in actual deaths on a month by month basis vs expected. Going back to 2020 we are about 500k over expected value in the US.</p>

        <p>Look, obviously the missing gold standard is one of the biggest problems hands down. that goes without saying.</p>
<p>And sure probably there is to much political Division to, at the moment, create some sort of valid control tool via vaccines/passports. But it would open more doors to this crap, its a dangerous precedent in this case.</p>
<p>There are some ways to live comfortably almost off grid, i will not deepen that, and it really depends on your favored lifestyle etc. but ok.</p>
<p>And dont worry about me denying covid , both my parents had covid at the same time. was rough. my momma still has some "after effects" from it. Still i would never ever want to see these digital vaccine passports or "health apps" as (entrance) requirements in any country that calls itself democratic</p>

<p>Then what's the alternative?  Tell immunocompromised people to just never leave the house because there is unfortunately a significant segment of the population that refuses to get vaccinated and help create herd immunity.  I agree it shouldn't be necessary but we unfortunately live in a time where people are enjoying denying science.  I don't think people who literally can't get a vaccine due to immune system issues should suffer so that others can not do it and refuse to wear masks.  The way you protect those people is via herd immunity it's why we have recently had a measles resurgence because we have dipped below the herd immunity level to in in parts of the country.</p>

        <p>But that's what we are going to be doing to people who can't get the vaccine once we have capacity for everyone who wants it to get it obviously.  I would consider knowingly putting someone at risk a dangerous activity personally.  Much in the same way we don't let people who get duis continue to drive restricting super spreaders who refuse to mask up from large gatherings seems rather prudent.</p>

        <p>Umm no thanks. I'm not sick and I'm not at danger for getting any one else sick. You want the gene therapy cool go get it. Same with the flu shot. I never get the flu shot and never get the flu and have never put anyone at risk. It's called being responsible for your own health. Just like we always have been.</p>

        <p>I absolutely would not be in fear. I live on this planet I can contract ebola tomorrow which has a higher rate of killing me so should I lock myself up forever? Nope. I'd walk right thru that covid ward and let someone cough on me. It's called building up my immune system and building antibodies.</p>

<p>Just lol the entire reason covid is an issue is we don't have natural immunity to it because it recently crossed from animals to humans aka it's novel.</p>

        <p>Coronaviruses have been around since the 60s. You're saying your body can't use non specific antibodies to fight whatever they encounter? How about various strains of the flu? Each year it's something different yet if you get sick your body attacks the invader and fights it. Unless you die each time you get the flu 🤔</p>

        <p>Because I can ditch the phone at any time and it's not registered to me personally with my details attached. Plus TOR. They can't tell who's using it.</p>
<p>I keep hearing that argument equating phones with the vaccine and it's bizarre. A piece of glass and plastic is not the same as being required to receive some medical treatment in order to participate in society.</p>

        <p>That’s the endgame. Total control of the masses. Not just where you can go but modifying your body as well. A new world order can only be ultimately solidified by physically modifying the people. A passport will make it so people will be easily coerced into being willing lab rats just to get a taste of 2019 back....</p>

        <p>Vaccine passports are a big attack on our civil liberties. It is not the government’s, nor any private company’s business to know whether I have been vaccinated or not. It is a personal choice.</p>

        <p>I'm afraid I would have to agree with you, my friend.</p>
<p>Most of us were blissfully unaware that <a href="https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/EB136/B136_25-en.pdf">the WHO had declared 2011-2020 'The Decade of Vaccines'</a>.</p>
<p>Or that, since 2018, <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/designing-implementing-immunisation-information-system_0.pdf">the European Union, has been striving to implement an 'Immunisation Information System'</a>. The EU's 'roadmap' to achieve this, published in 2019, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/vaccination/docs/2019-2022_roadmap_en.pdf">is stil available on their website</a>.</p>
<p>Off-Guardian published <a href="https://off-guardian.org/2020/05/22/report-eu-planning-vaccination-passport-since-2018/">a very interesting article about the EU's shenanigans</a> last May.</p>
<p>I imagine these 'vaccine passports'/digital certificates will be very easy to forge, leading to outrage by politicians and in the media. Conveniently, as an earlier poster predicted, a solution will be at hand in the form of subdermal microchips or, perhaps, digital tatoos.</p>
<p>Now, as you say, is the time to fight against this technocracy. Our lives really do depend depend on it.</p>
<p>Power to you and all those who stand with you.</p>

        <p>Not just new vaccines, but virtually any manner of control measures. I am openly assuming that the passport would eventually (like by the year 2025-30) morph into some kind of social credit system.</p>
