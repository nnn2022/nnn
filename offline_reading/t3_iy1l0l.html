    <strong>This lockdown costed me my relationship and has isolated me from my family</strong>
    <p><p>I'm posting this because it's going to be cathartic to get all of this shit out. Throwaway because my main account has some personal info.</p>
<p>I live in a border city. My now-ex girlfriend lives across the border from me. My family and lifelong friends live in another country as well. Naturally when this lockdown shit began it strained all of my relationships. It's just recently brought my girlfriend and I to the breaking point. A 5 year relationship between two very much in love people, gone because of the fact that we have not been able to and will not be able to for the foreseeable future even so much as spend one day with each other. And for what? People can still fucking fly to Cabo for vacation but I can't drive across to grab lunch with my girlfriend? I can't go back to my home country to see my family without quarantining and potentially not being let back into the country that I currently live? </p>
<p>I know this is extremely personal, but I can promise that I'm not the only one who is going through an absolute shit show because of this. There are plenty that are worse off than me. This shit is not humane. If the lockdown is the cure (it's not), then the side effect is the mental and physical health by way of lack of exercise, depression, etc, of every individual who has lost something due to this bullshit - I promise you that those numbers are climbing up and up, and fast.</p>
<p>This shit is straight up inhumane. I apologise for the rant but I had to get it off my chest. I'll never forgive the government in general nor the stupid fucks that blindly follow their agenda without at least a single question for as long as I live.</p></p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that. That comparison you made that people are allowed to fly to Cabo for vacation (interacting with numerous people along every step of that trip) but you can't simply drive across a land border and have lunch with one other person makes it sound so incredibly insane. </p>
<p><em>Literally</em> nothing about any of these restrictions makes any sense or has any logic to them. And I simply cannot for the life of me understand why more people can't see through the bullshit. I know, more and more people are waking up to it, but not enough and not quick enough. It's mind boggling.</p>

<p>Because they're either in the "go-along-to-get-along" camp and don't want to rock the boat or they've been broken down by 24/7 psychological warfare on a mental, psychological and spiritual level. Which is exactly the point of WHY exactly these restrictions are so arbitrary.</p>

        <p>Did you enjoy having your situation referred to as a "minor inconvenience" by the terrible people that advocate for this nightmare?  I don't enjoy that either, and they never stop saying it... Like a bunch of mind controlled zombies.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about your situation. You are not alone. I wish you, and all of us, a better 2021. Maybe things can pick back up with you guys, somehow, after all this is over. I'll cross my fingers for you.</p>

        <p>I'm so sorry your going through this. Im not sure if you happen to be Canadian or not, but I am in a similar boat of being in Canada and my gf in the US. It's been horrible how the Canadian govt doesnt give a damn about people and their relationships.</p>
<p>I am lucky enough to be a dual citizen and applied for my US passport. Next month I am moving to the US so I can see my gf for the first time in 7 months.</p>
<p>I can't even imagine the anger you must be experiencing right now.</p>

        <p>You need to know the metaphysical reasons behind what's going on. The ultimate goal is to harvest our life energy ("loosh" - look it up) by making the timid amongst us fearful, anxious, nervous wrecks, and making the rest (those that can't be intimidated) frustrated, tired and fed up.</p>
<p>Ultimately it's a metaphysical war. If you read up montalk.net, you'll know everything there is to know about it.</p>
