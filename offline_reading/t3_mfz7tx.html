        <p>Sadly, vaccine hesitancy has been lumped as being the same as being anti-vaccine. </p>
<p>They’re trying to use the stigma against the anti-vaxx movement to downplay individuals who are hesitant to take it because the vaccine doesn’t actually give you Covid, is still under an emergency use authorization, is using new technology which has yet to mature, and has been authorized for use under a greatly accelerated timeline.</p>
<p>The censorship is overkill because based on this person’s credentials, he is in a position to give an informed opinion unlike the majority of armchair medical experts on Twitter these days.</p>

        <p>It was never about trusting the scientific evidence.  It was always about the narrative.  Trust the experts, as long as they don't use their expertise and influence to tell you something outside of the narrative.</p>
<p>For the BIG LIE to work, it has to be big.  It has to be a bit unbelievable, so that people will say, "That doesn't sound right, it can't be true, but they're saying it on every channel, and repeating it on every broadcast, so it must be the gospel truth."</p>

<p>Agreed. Just like not wearing a mask has been compared to "actively murdering grandma"</p>
