        <p>&rt; Structure of Covid Spike</p>
<p>would love your text explanation, is HERV-w the precursor to syncytin-1? how about comparing the retroviruses to sarscov2? I have concern about loss of essential retroviruses as cause of reproductive damage.</p>

        <p>Sorry super late reply. Been busy with trip planning and work. </p>
<p>So one of our ancestors got a retrovirus once and now all of us have it in our DNA. HERV-w a family of these retroviral genes that's part of the HERV Super family of retrovirus inherited genes which we all have. </p>
<p>Its really just nomenclature. HERV is the big category, HERV-w is a category inside HERV, and Syncytin-1 is a gene in HERV-w.</p>
<p>Syncytin-1 is a gene in the HERV-w family that came from retroviruses and now we all have. Through evolution we modified the gene from being a viral/potentially harmful to being something that our cells could use. </p>
<p>First of all, covid is not a retrovirus. Its just a normal RNA virus, so it's RNA does not get inserted into our DNA. </p>
<p>second of all, our immune responses have several pathways through which they identify "self". Before any Tcell or Bcell can go out and do its job, it goes through a strict selection process where it is presented with all sorts of antigens expressed by cells throughout our whole body. If one of these cells recognizes a "self" antigen, it gets killed. </p>
<p>Then, when out in the body, there's further checks and balances that prevent immune cells from attacking "self". It's all really complicated. It depends on the location of the cells, the antigen, etc. </p>
<p>For example, you can eat other animals meat and be fine, but if you inject yourself with a bit of animal meat, you'll develop an immune response to meat and won't be able to eat it anymore. 
My supervisor worked with chicken eggs for a long time in a previous lab. She inhaled a lot of chicken egg residue, so after working there for a few years she and other co-workers developed severe egg allergies. </p>
<p>Finally. Like I said, the the covid-spike structure is really different from Syncytin-1. The vaccine presents the body with a complete covid spike structure so the body develops its own anti-bodies to it. The process wouldn't be any different than just catching covid and developing antibodies that way (except that you won't get sick of course)
The immune cells involved in the immune response would've already gone through a vetting process that prevents them from reacting to Syncytin-1, so even if the covid spike had a similar structure to syncytin-1 you wouldn't be able to develop a syncytin-1 immune response from this vaccine.</p>

        <p>Thank you for your thoughtful response I’ve not read an iota of that much detail from Pfizer etc, given the lack of trials on toxicity etc related to pregnancy I’m still suspect. The number Of hyperinflammatory responses from various trials from Peru to USA to Uk etc has me suspicious. Until women successfully reproduce after vaccination , all theoretical information is only that. Gates family history ties to Margaret Sanger, his funding of Dare and the anti fertility microchip, the death of vaccine activists, the nurse on tv today passing out on camera, te misinformation about amplitude cycles and how the FDA guidelines toward 40 cycles creates 90% false positives, and the general politicians and cops playing doctor, restricting travel and isolation of healthy people says more about this as part of a Bioterror profiteering scheme than a genuine health crises, why can’t FOIA requests be made to look at how US/WH funded operation warp speed, where are Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Kadlec of anthrax scare and anthrax vaccine fame (which created the ‘Gulf War Syndrome’ by using regulated chemicals like Squalene in their anthrax vax) - meanwhile US Army bioweapons research has been doing projects for decades in Wuhan at university virus labs, speaking of, it seems that the environment is being polluted ... and why are pharma companies protected legally from vaccine injuries? In fact calling something a vaccine actually indemnities a product from legal liability. Pharma are funded by USA on RnD, the State is buying their stock, why must the taxpayer funded payouts for injuries?</p>
