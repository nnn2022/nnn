        <p>People in Toronto/Ontario shit so hard on this guy and call him crazy yet everything he said is true or has come true (so far). He's actually pretty prophetic as even I wouldn't have guessed any of this that early on.  How the hell did he know all that?</p>

<p>When you know a tiny bit of their plan, pretty much everything becomes predictable.</p>
<p>By the end of this year, most people have UBI.</p>
<p>Oh and 'we' are still in lockdown.</p>

<p>How to become Nostradamus in 2 (3) easy steps:</p>
<p>Step 0: Turn off the media. TV, social media, "news" sites, radio, newspapers, everything. It's all propaganda. If you're worried about being uninformed, realize that being uninformed is many times better than being misinformed. You can fix uninformed. It's harder to fix misinformed.</p>
<p>Step 1: When you inevitably hear some "news" (seriously, unless you go live off-grid in the woods, it will find you), ask yourself "Who benefits from this?" Even if you believe harder than an evangelical christian believes in god that current events was just "oopsie random happening", someone is still benefiting from it.</p>
<p>Step 2: Once you've figured out who is benefiting from the event, ask yourself how they're going to capitalize on it. Nobody is benevolent and everyone is looking to improve their lot. For the average person, it's usually more security or comfort. For someone who has that (like the people at the top), usually more power for them or their legacy.</p>
<p>Once you've mastered that first step and are proficient in the second two, congratulations. You can now predict events months or years in advance.</p>

        <p>Much worse with tighter restrictions is the optimistic prediction and most likely. There's a bunch of others depending on what you care about and how doomer you want to get. </p>
<p>There's a group that believes now that orange man is gone things will calm down a bit, but I am not one of those people. I think they're angry he ever happened and will clamp down extra hard to ensure nobody like him ever happens again. There's likely going to be a major false flag event soon to hammer it home.</p>

        <p>My concern with "orange man bad" being out of the way as the blame for everything is that they'll be shifting the blame to us. Which I've already seen happening as any anti-lockdown protest is written in the media as an alt-right, Trump-supporting, Qanon-believing, conspiratorial one. That means places like this which are a haven for many will more than likely be gone very soon. And any opinion that doesn't toe the line will be deemed dangerous and extremist. I shudder to think what the rest holds.</p>

        <p>Yep, that's pretty likely. Hope you've kept your anonymity strong these past 4 years, because you won't want to be one of the easy targets when they start randomly selecting people to ruin, if they don't just systematically destroy everyone.</p>
