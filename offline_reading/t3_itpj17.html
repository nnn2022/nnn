        <p>I consider it a reasonable risk to go without a mask. I have a 99.96% of surviving covid even if I catch it. I’m sure the odds are much higher I would be hurt in a car accident. I prefer my freedom.</p>

        <p>A tiny percentage, if that, have any kind of long term damage. It’s funny now that deaths have plummeted, you guys have started harping on this whole long term damage narrative. Nothing about this virus was worth destroying our lives over. The only reason politicians have doubled down on all of this is because they can’t just come out and say “We over reacted, and it’s time to go back to normal” because they know people would be pissed and they would risk losing reelection. 2020s only a dumpster fire because of them.</p>

        <p>I find it strange that you all hone in on the whole “anti mask” aspect of this sub. If you actually took time to review the data and information we share, you’ll find a pretty solid amount of people here who will comply with mask requirements inside public buildings. I’m not going to give you the satisfaction of telling you we enjoy it but I’d say probably over half the people here comply with it.</p>
<p>If you took time to read through our posts and discussions, you’ll find a much greater concern for the overarching authoritarian reach occurring in dozens of countries currently. See most of us in here aren’t super young. While ages vary, you’ll more often find people who are 25+ years old. We are old enough to have had relatives who fought in many wars to stop the kind of authoritarian creep we are experiencing now. We fear it because we were raised to recognize it. We see the things we were warned to never let happen again actually happening again. </p>
<p>You see, people like you are blissfully ignorant (and man am I ever jealous of that) to what comes next. You think that if all 330 million Americans or whatever whole population of whatever country you’re from just follows every single conflicting and arbitrary rule for an indefinite period of time, the virus will just vanish and we can flip a switch and go back to normal because our governments allow us to. It’s a lovely though. I wish I could share that idealism with you but the fact is that politicians that make it to the level of governor or higher aren’t there because they give a shit about you. They’re enjoying watching us all do rain dances and voodoo and be at each other’s throats about this because they are power tripping monsters that want you sucking their dick so they accumulate more power. They want you dependent on them. They want you at their feet. You probably don’t comprehend that because you think they care about you. I’m sorry but they don’t. And they will keep this charade up as long as they can.</p>
<p>Mask mandates are just 1 item in a series of moves and efforts to dehumanize you. They don’t want you to see anyone else in your life as human. They want you to see everyone as a disease vector that should be stamped out for simply daring to exist. They don’t want you gathering with people who share your interests. They don’t want you close to your family. They don’t want you hugging or showing affection to anyone because it makes it easier to control you if you’re miserable and detached from the rest of humanity. Before Covid, they couldn’t quite get their teeth into anything enough to really bring down the power on their constituents but now they’ve scared everyone so much that it’s quite easy to do and maintain. </p>
<p>You don’t have any way to know that 200,000 people have actually died from this in the US. I’m not saying people haven’t died but once I saw CNN with a death ticker on every newscast, something didn’t feel right about it. They can give you whatever number and in a country as big as the US, there’s no way to ever know. China expelled all journalists from their shores before unlocking Wuhan. You think you’re getting truthful numbers from them when they deliberately expelled the journalists holding them to account? HA! </p>
<p>I know what I’ve just said to you won’t probably convince you to think differently. Your heels are dug in. You have been trained to trust your government implicitly. That must be a nice feeling. But it’s fictitious and you are unfortunately being played and I truly hope for all our sakes that enough people grasp that we’re being played so we can take our lives back. I know way too much about megalomaniacal governments to think ours is any different. That if we just play by the rules, the government will give us our lives back. They can always fabricate more to fear via the media. They could convince people like you to never again leave your homes or see your family if they wanted to. They probably won’t but they could. But they’re certainly going to drag this out as long as they can thanks to people like you who believe them lockstep. I’m sorry you’re being taken for a ride by them. You’re probably a nice person with a good heart that just feels very strongly that these raindances are saving lives. I hope you’ll consider all the lives that will be lost due not to covid but because of all these restrictions the general population rolled over and accepted. Covid is not now nor will it ever be the biggest killer or the only killer and right now we are ignoring all other suffering and death. There will be a reckoning eventually.</p>

<p>Because they don't work and create a false sense of security and is hard to read facial expressions and effects death people and states that have mandated masks like California or Vermont actually had a increase or no change 2 weeks after the mandate</p>

<p>Potentially increasing infection</p>
<p>And masks like the n95 reduce oxygen intake by up to 20% and increases things like headaches and what not</p>
<p>If you can provide a RCT study proving masks work lmk</p>
