    <strong>I don’t care whether the vaccine works or not; I’m not getting vaccinated</strong>
    <p><p>They say it’ll work in two years, until then mask up. I don’t care, its my right to choose whether I get vaccinated or not. These brainwashed sheep falling for all the fear mongering bs can shove it; its time to wake up and speak up.  </p>
<p>This is out of control. Its not about the virus. Its about controlling freedom, and money. </p>
<p>They want to segregate the people. If we give in and don’t support the unvaccinated, its going to end bad.</p></p>

        <p>Anyone that gives into the vax is giving into our future imprisonment. We need to continue to resist. We need to support each other when we become jobless and homeless fighting for our freedom. We need to support the businesses that support unvaccinated business. We business owners to continue to support the unvaccinated. </p>
<p>This is war, and unfortunately, many of us don’t know where to start that because they haven’t been through it, this is why second amendment is so important.</p>

        <p>the point is I had many other vaccines in my life, that i considered neccesary in terms of protection from certain illnesses. Never, never in my life, i care if others had taken the same vaccines or no. I just took mine and carry on. Why people is obssesed about others with this one?</p>

        <p>Great question. If they cared about our health and safety they wouldn’t have released an experimental drug on the public. </p>
<p>This is about our freedom, its not about protecting each other from covid with the vaccine. It never was. Point is, we should have a choice to wear a mask or vaccinate. Its the forcing of it, the complete neglect of the constitution, our rights as citizens and the law of the land. Its the dishonestly surrounding the legitimacy, the origin if the virus, the lack of real honest answers that we are concerned with. </p>
<p>If the virus was so legitimate, why would people have to be lying about the reality of it in order to make it real? </p>
<p>The unvaccinated are the only people standing in the way of complete authoritarian power from the government. If they give in our future may not have a say. </p>
<p>We were loosing our constitutional rights, little by little over the years, and now they, the elites, have taken strikes for complete power hoping we were weak enough to take over. </p>
<p>Call us conspirators, or what have you, we the unvaccinated, the patriots of freedom will continue to fight, whether people like it or not.</p>

        <p>I totally agree with you on your reply. Spot on!! beyond the public health issue, there is a question of limitations of personal freedoms. We saw the same processes back in 9/11.</p>

        <p>Me neither. When you have a vaccine this dangerous, it doesn't really matter if it works or not. Just take Ivermectin or something instead.</p>
