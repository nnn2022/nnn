        <p>Thanks for pointing this out. This is how misinformation spreads without people calling out their bullshit. </p>
<p>Yes "Science" has never been 100% accurate, because it's a process that is refined over time. The pharmaceutical industries have made rapid improvements which help determine what will be successful and what will be detrimental. Combined with the cooperation seen across the industry that has enabled them to push out a working vaccine in record time. </p>
<p>It's important to be skeptical of new things. With how much misinformation is being spread, think before posting something ripped off of ifunny.</p>

        <p>Funny, that's actually what I'm doing right now! I'm looking through some scientific databases. Have you ever done that? I'm always surprised by the absurdly poor quality of research people do here, I thought that having basic brain function would let people see that maybe a study from 1998 is outdated or fox news isn't a credible source.</p>

        <p>DDT shouldn't have been banned. We used it to wipe out malaria here in North America, we could have exterminated malaria worldwide. It WAS being overused, they were drenching entire fields in the stuff and it's that agricultural runoff that had the harmful side effects. So they should have restricted its usage rather than banning it outright. It is now the official policy of the WHO that we should go back to using DDT in more targeted settings, such as bednets and residences.</p>

        <p>I remember being forced to read an article in school that was something about Eagles eating bugs covered in the stuff and the chemicals caused their eggs to be super soft, to the point where some broke by being sat on by their mother. You can say what you want about hating bugs and chemicals being useful but it is pretty messed up if it is really causing birds to basically kill their babies by sitting on them.</p>

        <p>Yes, that's exactly what happens when DDT is used <em>en masse</em> on agricultural fields, and the runoff is allowed to accumulate in the food chain. That practice was rightfully ended. But it was a tragedy to ban DDT everywhere, when it was only that specific practice that caused that problem.</p>

        <p>Science itself is a process. </p>
<p>When COVID first hit the CDC said wash your hands, it is the only sure fire way to kill the virus. We are unsure if Lysol or hand sanitizer have any effect.</p>
<p>People’s response was to ignore this statement and buy up all the Lysol, hand sanitizer and toilet paper, leaving tons of hand soup in the isles. </p>
<p>Turns out that Lysol and hand sanitizer actually work too so despite that these people bought all this stuff without any confirmation of the science, they still made a smart choice. </p>
<p>Science is constantly evolving, they find new stuff out all the time. What was thought to be safe today causes cancer tomorrow, and the chemical labeled toxic, taken in small doses can kill ring worms. That is what science is. A constantly changing field of study.</p>

        <p>Yes, and that is why it is extremely important to be following the people who dedicate their lives to go through that process. That is what I am doing. That is what I have been doing. Following, replicating, and critiquing of and as the process. Just because something could change, however, is not a reason to discard our current conclusions. Those conclusions are, per the process, the most likely to be correct.</p>

        <p>You're not aware of the science: all the news, politicians and experts is advertisement and PR.      </p>
<p>Proof: science <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19802-w">can't find evidence of asymptomatic transmission in Sars-cov2</a>. All the articles and studies supporting it, are either predictive models or conflating presymptomatic and asymptomatic. In the real world, science couldn't demonstrate this thesis.     </p>
<p>Proof 2: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm">the vaccine reduces Sars-cov2 transmission to negligible levels</a>. Now compare this science with whatever the news say.</p>

        <p>The first one, I'm sorry, but I just can't trust anything out of China right now. We both know they likely botched their numbers.</p>
<p>Right, that's why I trust the science and not the news. I'm nearly fully vaccinated, and when I do I will go back to hanging out with my friends as normal, without masks. I'll no longer be sparing about my trips out. I'm still gonna wear a mask in public, just to make it easy on those around me, so I don't need to explain to grocery store clerks and restaurant workers that I'm vaccinated.</p>

<p>Ironic considering that the asymptomatic magic theory came from them. And the "lockdowns work" theory as well.     </p>
<p>Also it's not China: it's the whole rest of the planet that have been unable to prove any meaningful asymptomatic transmission. The lack of data after 400 days speaks for itself.</p>

        <p>See that's a mighty BIG difference.</p>
<p><strong>- Presymptomatic</strong> are on average 12 hours from full-on sickness. It's a quick and gradual process over those hours. You start feeling unwell.    </p>
<p>If we assumed that the entire world population would catch covid in a given year, and develop symptoms: there's a 12 hour window to be infectious in the whole year. Let's make it 8 hours on average accounting for sleep (for obvious reasons): <strong>every person would have a  0,33/365 chance a day. 1 in a 1000 chance that a random person you interact with is in presymptomatic state</strong>.      </p>
<p>Of course, not everyone will get it so the number is lower, a high % won't develop symptoms so the number is lower, already immune people won't get it so the number is lower over time, and <strong>you need prolonged, close contact in indoors settings to be infected</strong>.    </p>
<p><strong>- Asymptomatic:</strong> never, at no point they get sick. As they don't get sick, the only sign of their... Condition? is a positive PCR. <strong>There's no scientific evidence that this group, a majority, can infect others</strong>.     </p>
<p>What do you think? Do you find something wrong in this rational, facts-based logic?</p>

        <p>Ah, I see the difference here. I wasn't familiar with the more clinical definition of asymptomatic being cases that never show symptoms. Your research is correct, those cases haven't had any proof that they have much chance at infection. Mind you, they haven't gotten any proof in the other direction, but all of this results from just a lack of effort to figure out how much they transmit. That makes sense, although now that I'm off mobile, I can give you something a little more substantial. Yes, original estimates for cases said that up to 80% of cases were asymptomatic, and those fully asymptomatic cases are not large contributors to the disease. <strong>However</strong>, that percentage has been disproven more recently. The better estimate hovers around 17% (<a href="https://www-pnas-org.libproxy.rose-hulman.edu/content/118/9/e2019716118">https://www-pnas-org.libproxy.rose-hulman.edu/content/118/9/e2019716118</a>,<a href="https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030">https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/jammi-2020-0030</a>). My question, though, is where exactly are you going with this anyway?</p>
