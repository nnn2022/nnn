        <p>Oryx and Crake, written by the same author, is even more compelling and I suggest you look into that one. Margaret really had some good sources, she predicted a lot about modern society and where things were headed. Without spoiling too much, in this book a mad scientist, whose mind was essentially rotted into a secondary sociopath from watching internet porn and gore videos as a child, creates a Viagra-like medication called "BlyssPlus" which causes a pandemic and mass sterility in the population, in order for mankind to be replaced by a vegan, polyandrous species of genetically-modified humans with a limited breeding season created by the same mad scientist to combat climate change and overpopulation. He basically genetically engineered a version of "humanity" which can actually be maintained under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.</p>
