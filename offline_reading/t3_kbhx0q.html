        <p>&rt; I’ve studied communication networks in school</p>
<p>Oh so you've worked in a biology lab studying the effects of pervasive, 24/7 EM radiation in the 24Ghz+ range on different types of human tissue / animals / plants? Over long periods (months, years) with lots of different variables in play? Surely your studies encompassed all that, and more.</p>
<p>The same billionaires and technocrats making the calls about COVID lockdowns / rushed vaccines are THE SAME KINDS OF PEOPLE who declare by fiat that something like 5G is perfectly safe. Surely you trust our benefactors?</p>
<p>If you feel like they aren't hearing you about issue X, this isn't the first time they've tried to steamroll opposition to whatever gives them more power and money. People keep getting upset about 'conspiracy theorists' in this sub. <strong>What do you think you are, for challenging their 'expert' authority?</strong> Go literally anywhere else on reddit and start talking about any of this stuff, excluding all the 'crazy' stuff. How do you think you'll be treated?</p>
<p>Personally I neither know nor care about 5G (just yet, because I'm more concerned with other things), but I do know that people who stand to make billions aren't the kinds of people you want to trust to do their own safety evaluations. And if you think that 'science' is some abstract ideal that exists in a vacuum, with no regard for real world politics or who signs the paychecks, you must be new on this planet. (Ever heard of the 'replication crisis', by the way?)</p>
<p>Look at the <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/the-surgisphere-scandal-what-went-wrong--67955">scandal with the hydroxychloroquine papers</a> that were yanked from 2 medical journals in record time because they were based on NONEXISTENT DATA, which was never explained or followed up by any of the so-called journalists who were happy to report on the initial studies. But it was used to discredit HCQ treatment, even convincing people it was possibly dangerous based on data which had no basis in reality.</p>
<p>This whole thing worldwide isn't just mass hysteria. There are people with VERY PUBLIC agendas, people with funding pushing all the right levers of society. It doesn't happen by accident. That's what's known in the biz as a 'conspiracy' - something which, according to normal people, has only happened twice in history: the murder of Julius Caesar and the entire administration of Donald Trump. Otherwise? Silly rumors, easily debunked.</p>

<p>Yeah because school never tell you the actual truth. The education systems are meant to brain wash you not educate you. So many scientists already came out and said it's a deadly weapon.</p>

<p>5g is known for how dangerous it is, people already died from it in areas where it exists, many kids got cancer from it and many died, these are facts, scientists and researchers already came out and proved it was dangerous even engineers did, it's well documented nothing is crazy about this they're trying to depopulate us and it's literally written in the Georgia Guidestones , it's not a conspiracy, the real conspiracy is that covid bull shit.</p>

        <p>&rt;I’ve studied communication networks in school</p>
<p>Are you seriously going to use the "I learnt 5G in school" argument?</p>
<p>Regardless of whether 5G is harmful or not... Do you really think possible health risks of radiation are the kind of thing they'd teach people in a communication networks course?</p>
<p>The level of ignorance &amp; naivity displayed by that particular sentence is astounding, really.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;I wish this sub would focus on stopping the normalization of the Covid guidelines and drop all this anti vax and anti 5G bullshit</p>
<p>I wish people would stop presuming that school teaches people anything about anything that matters, save (if they're lucky) a few technical skills that could make you a useful wage slave.</p>

        <p>&rt; Every WiFi router that exists will emit a small amount of radiation 5G is no different </p>
<p>I'm sure they also "forgot" to mention that WiFi radiation is harmful... or cellphone radiation...</p>
<p>It was demonstrated no less than 2 decades ago that holding a cellphone against your head while is making a connection with a cellphone tower is harmful. Yet, besides a single seminar at the civil engineering department of my country's most prominent university, I'm not aware of any attempts to make the public aware of this risk.</p>

        <p>&rt;That’s because you’re stupid. No it isn’t harmful if it’s a small enough amount.</p>
<p>So it's harmful if the amount is large enough?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt;If what you’re saying is true then 100% of people would have cancer</p>
<p>That's not how this thing works.</p>
<p>Not everyone holds their phones against their heads WHILE it's ringing. Not everyone uses their cellphone all the time. Also, there may be differences between different manifacturers. etc.</p>
<p>They're countless perfectly valid reasons for why some people might develop cancer from holding a phone too close to their heads while others do not.</p>

        <p>The depopulation thing really hits home. I feel like in the last 10 years everyone has moved away from starting families and having kids. Waiting till you are 40 to have a baby and aborting every other pregnancy if the time isn't perfectly right is seen as completely normal. Homosexual marriage means no procreation, abortion means no babies, delayed child rearing puts larger gaps between birth and death rates. Its been happening for years now and its really scary to see that a factor in this.</p>

        <p>Yeah they slowly made it too expensive or just removed the religion factor which told people to marry young and procreate and instead replaced it with shit minimum wage jobs and use-discard throwaway tinder style relationships because everyone is supposedly too busy with their "careers". </p>
<p>They say to make a culture survive you need a birthrate of 2.1 per woman. The west has on avg much less than that.</p>

        <p>&rt; Waiting till you are 40 to have a baby and aborting every other pregnancy if the time isn't perfectly right is seen as completely normal. Homosexual marriage means no procreation, abortion means no babies, delayed child rearing puts larger gaps between birth and death rates. Its been happening for years now and its really scary to see that a factor in this. </p>

        <p>If anybody wonders why 2030 keeps on being repeated here's the official document, off the website of the UN: <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/21252030%20Agenda%20for%20Sustainable%20Development%20web.pdf">https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/21252030%20Agenda%20for%20Sustainable%20Development%20web.pdf</a></p>
<p>I dont care if you believe me or not,  but because of my work and education I actually went to the UN a couple of years back and i saw this document then and there and can personally verify its not a new idea. Its been around for much longer than that as well. These "sustainable goals" (how they call them) sound nice, after all the market is as the betterment of society but please take your time and think what this actually means for your lifestyle and society as a whole.</p>

        <p>Exactly!!! Thank you this is actually a very good document, and yes this is their Agenda 2030 and agenda 21 they were planing for this almost 100 years ago , people think this is a joke, they don't realize, they already admitted it many times. People just don't want to wake up they want to say ignorant.</p>

        <p>I think it boils down to the fact that most people are simply too busy with their own day to day obligations or need to survive to even bother with such issues. Also its very typical with people who're actually up to something to discredit others who confront them as "loonies" of all sorts so they wouldnt be listened to. </p>
<p>You gotta have the time and interest or just be at the "right place" to even come across such things. I know i for sure wouldnt even looked into any of this myself either. I remember seeing their other leaflets (I was barely 20 at the time)  and wondering why the fuck do they always put blacks on covers and whats this massive deal with sustainable this, sustainable that, but at 20 youre not really capable of "reading between the lines". Or at least I wasnt. But then i saw the changes implemented in our society here (netherlands is on the progesssive side), I learned about how people live in China and started noticing that our society is becoming more and more controlled by non democratic supra national institutions and it slowly comes together. </p>
<p>I also know (because my educational background is in IT and math, not international relations) that Internet of things and emerging data processing software will probably steal the last bit of privacy that we have. AI assessing if you have antisocial intentions? Coming to your neighbourhood soon.</p>
<p>It used to be that only your box of a computer can log your searches, but not its your laptop, tablet, phone, local camera and soon to be your fridge, closet and washing machine and god knows what too too. You already know if you talk close to your phone about "some product" youre likely to get a commercial pop up about it within minutes. Some say IoT is connected to this 5g stuff, but im not qualified enough to comment on that. In essence this technology sounds cool, who wouldnt want the fridge to make your shopping list according to your preferences automatically? But the issue is they can and probably will steal your data. Thank god for GDPR and other laws but i dont know how much they protect you from massive organisations with a lot of power.   </p>
<p>I dont know man...i looked at your site and its not because i want to discredit it or anything, i just hope its wrong in making its predictions. I hope its just some group of people looking to capitalize on peoples needs to make stories out of day to day life and not some genuine "scenario" that will probably roll out in front of our eyes. But then I look around and see how mad people have gone, the loss of critical thinking skills and willingly given up independence, I see the younger ones pushing for socialism in our universities, I see how people in china accept to live, i see this climate bs being pumped into kids minds by Greta and co. as well as the completely age inappropriate lgbt mantra, the breakdown of families, and now this mass hysteria over a slightly worse flu season? I came to the "developed world", but i think ill leave for a less "developed" country where people still live like humans ought to, in untouched communities, without mass surveillance all this if they choose to go trough with it. Technology is wrecking society imo and facilitating the development of a very dystopian world. </p>
<p>Who wants to live as an isolated, tracked, masked, chemically experimented on, confined, influenced, guilty, earth destroying CO2 emitter? Because thats how they seem to see and treat most of us.</p>

<p>I'm sure most if not all of what's on that roadmap is accurate.</p>
<p>Yet I still struggle to convince people I know in the "real world", outside this echo chamber, that anything nefarious is going on.</p>
<p>People who get most of their info from mainstream sources don't have a clue, really. They might as well have been living under a rock for all those months.</p>

        <p>That's because people like you are ignorant and do see what's going on. 5g is a silent weapon just like the vaccine, 5g was use in ww2 as a weapon. Researchers and scientists already came out and spoke against it.</p>
