    <strong>Stop forced Covid-19 shots, Pfizer's World HQ, NYC, 1/13/2021</strong>
    <p><p>Since the Autism Action Network was founded more than 10 years ago, we have focused on trying to influence decision-makers to do the right thing. We are constantly asking you to write, call, email and show up in state capitals and Washington, DC.  But we are in a whole new world, it has never been more clear that the politicians respond to giant corporations, not the people.  The regulatory agencies that are supposed to protect us are captured by the companies they are supposed to regulate. Big Tech blatantly censors news and private communication at odds with their agendas. It is time to sidestep the messengers and focus on the corporations who are really calling the shots.</p>
<pre><code> So we are gathering in the heart of Manhattan at the global headquarters of Pfizer, the largest drug company in the world, and the manufacturer of the first Covid-19 shot approved in the US, to fight for your right to decide whether you or your children are forced to inject Covid-19 shots. Join us!


New York Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal (D-Upper Westside) has introduced Assembly Bill A11179 that would allow Governor Andrew Cuomo to order anybody to get Covid-19 vaccines at any time and for any reason he chooses. To our knowledge this is the first mandatory Covid-19 shot legislation in the US. We must stop this bill, and other bills like it that will show up through the US. Pfizer will reap the profits if this bill passes.
