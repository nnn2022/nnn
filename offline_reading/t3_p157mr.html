        <p>Yep. I have zero sympathy for most of my countrymen at this point, particularly the restaurateurs who sat on their asses and uttered not a peep of protest during the 7 month closure,  I honestly donâ€™t care if they go out of business.</p>

        <p>This is the elephant in the room. People, naturally, oppose a "loicense" for living life. However, people CANNOT live without their iJails (Dumbphones/SpyPhones/et al.)</p>
<p>The fact that your phone is a personal brain cage does not seem to affect people (Balkanization anyone? Media Bubbles?).</p>
<p>The fact that the NSA/CIA/FBI/et al. are constantly spying on the World does not seem to affect people.</p>
<p>The fact that your phone is constantly taking pictures of your face (biometrics) and reporting your location (GPS) does not affect anyone. The Health App knows waaaayyyy too much about you. As does Goolag.</p>
<p>So, why would they be upset if their iJail demands that it be displayed when one eats at an establishment? They never leave home without it.</p>
<p>I believe that, if the establishment could put everyone into a separate, windowless prison, they would. In a heartbeat. And they would feed you your own newsfeed/movies/images. False families. False memories. Just a prisoner in a planetwide eternal lockdown.</p>
