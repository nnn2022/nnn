    <strong>Let‚Äôs discuss the #2 stickied post on this sub ‚ÄúGot my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine today‚Äù</strong>
    <p><p>This is egregious. </p>
<p>I had to read it three times to confirm it wasn‚Äôt satire or a joke I was missing. </p>
<p>If this was stickied because the mods thought this was helpful, then they need to do some explaining.</p>
<p>Mods. Please, enlighten us. </p>
<p>From my point of view, if there is no acknowledgement of what happened here then logic would say that this sub has been entirely infiltrated and is beyond saving.</p>
<p>Edit 2/19: The mods made it right. Explained that the poster was a rouge mod who has been since booted.</p></p>

        <p>Evidence of shills in the mod team, keep people confined to a couple subs and then slowly creep the propaganda at then from sources they will be more agreeable too. Reddit is a cesspool for lockdowns, medical Tyranny and the new world order.</p>

        <p>I'll be a bit more optimistic on this.</p>
<p>I think it's just one of the mods who is against lockdown and other restrictions, but it's totally okay with the vaccine. Maybe he felt a bit guilty for moderating a community who seems to be strongly against the COVID vaccine and decided to share his experience to do some activism to encourage others to do the same. He has the right to do so, but I think what didn't go well was the fact that he pinned the post. Pinning it was a way to bypass the upvoting system, which can lead to people thinking that his post wasn't genuine (eg: mods trying to compromise with Reddit to not get this subreddit banned). I personally think it was genuine as I think it was a bad move to pin it, but that's just my opinion and what I like about this sub (compared to others) is that here we care and respect each other's opinion, even if different.</p>

        <p>Not only that, but he practically called us idiots and told us we need the vaccine. Said he was putting his foot down lol. None of that bothered me more than it being pinned.</p>

        <p>It was stickied for several hours, then un-stickied, and then stickied again.</p>
<p>Bet they had a real interesting conversation about it in mod chat. ü§£</p>
