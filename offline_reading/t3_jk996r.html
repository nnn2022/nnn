    <strong>It’s so frustrating that people who live alone are ignored or chastised over loneliness concerns during lockdown</strong>
    <p><p>I think the topic of living alone has come up before, but with new lockdowns and the holidays approaching I think another discussion is warranted. </p>
<p>What frustrates me is when all these politicians reinstituting lockdowns or advising people to celebrate holidays with only those in your household, they’re ignoring a sizable part of the population that lives alone. Our household is...us. What does that mean? We’re punished by having to go through the holidays sitting around alone? Do people not realizing how depressing that is, and the dangers that can lead to? </p>
<p>I’m in NJ, they’re also saying don’t cross state lines unless absolutely necessary. All my family are in different states. I’m not about to spend Christmas alone. And don’t get me started on zoom. I’d rather not speak to my family at all that day than try to replicate the day on zoom. </p>
<p>Anyone else sad or concerned about this?</p></p>

        <p>I stopped listening to politicians and guidance months ago, when it became evident that no one, not even many of my alleged friends, gave even half a shit about people like me who live alone and were suffering in isolation. Now I just do what I want. It's better that way.</p>

        <p>These are the same politicians that get caught travelling across state lines to visit their family for the holidays. I had a family member living in Toronto where the border is completely closed and emergency lockdowns are in full force. That didn't stop Trudeau from visiting his family for Easter after demanding that everyone else stay home, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to cross state lines, you absolutely should. I have spent many holidays alone, and no one should suffer that loneliness if they have other options. Don't let anyone stop you from living your life like a sensible person.</p>

        <p>Yeah.  Baffled by people’s refusal to see it.</p>
<p>I think if pro-restriction people really acknowledged the impact of this time on (the very very many) single people they’d have to have some sort of moral crisis about it.  About the harm their chosen policies are doing.  So it’s easier to just choose not to see.  Minimise, gaslight, pretend it isn’t so.  I’ve had people do this to me, to my face - just refuse to see what I’m going through.  It’s bullshit and I won’t be quick to forgive them when this is all over.</p>

<p>Hahahahahahaha!!</p>
<p>I also live in NJ, but I've been crossing state lines - specifically into NYC - since late April to visit my boyfriend after we spent two months apart.</p>
<p>I personally don't care for the winter holidays, but he does, so I celebrate with his family (mine doesn't celebrate them either beyond cooking a lot). Unless they shut down public transportation and close all the bridges, I will be back in NYC for Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p>
<p>Stress of 2020 did temporarily kill our relationship. We reconciled - one reason being if we will break up, it will not be because of a damn wall the government is trying to put between us - and though it was unexpected, it was a huge relief for both of us. Now, we're both just trying to stay away from the media as much as possible.</p>
