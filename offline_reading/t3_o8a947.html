    <strong>I need help. How do you explain absolute effect to a laymen?</strong>
    <p><p>We know that the vaccine gives an absolute benefit of about 1% as seen in pfizers stage 3 clinical trials. This is also being found in other studies. I understand the statistics but I find myself having a difficult time trying to explain it who doesn't know the stats. Just curious if there are any creative folk that have a good way of explaining it?</p></p>

        <p>At this point, with so many sources that have previously been presumed credible, dabbling in political bullshit, I cannot fully trust any single reference but the departure from the narrative has me leaning toward believing in this instance.</p>

        <p>It's also a good point. That's why you have to have a definition of credible for yourself to cross reference the sources. That's why it's good to start at the beginning. Understand why the Emergency Use Authorization (eua) was instated and the criteria for that. From there, you can see how the pharma companies reacted. A great example is pfizers replies to the reviewers comments in their stage 3 clinical trials. I strongly recommend reading them. </p>
<p>This process will also help piece together the current narrative and the positive reinforcing mechanisms that are sustaining it. From on the Frontline in the hospitals, to universities and their researchers, politicians, local communities and groups,.etc. once that picture is painted, you can see the gaps and see those speaking out against the narratives at almost every level. This is the process that allows you to establish credibility.</p>

        <p>That's a fair question. The way I presented it was from the same data the efficacy of the vaccine was claimed. Specifically, the stage 3 clinical trials of the pfizer vaccine. </p>
<p>The knowing comes from the statistics based on the experiment. The fear mongering and propaganda come from the media only discussing the reletive effect (95%) vs the absolute effect, 1%. </p>
<p>The difficulty is that most people aren't trained in statistics. Especially statistics used for clinical trials. So in conversations that this come up, I lose people in the actual numbers and was looking for a more colloquially way to explain it. </p>
<p>The numbers are there for the world to see. The difference is between those who look, or those who just accept what others tell them the numbers are.</p>

        <p>Ooohhh oooh I want to try!
(Does the mental equivalent of a ridiculous ninja warm up)</p>
<p>Absolute Effect is the overall net reduction in total risk when viewed at an individual level within a population, against the same overall net risk of that individual in that population without an intervention. For example, if no intervention would create 8 serious events in 100 people, but intervention means only 2 serious events in 100, then they could say intervention resulted in a 75% decrease in risk of serious events for each individual. However, in that example the absolute effect is only 6%. The difference is a result of factoring in the high probability that most people will not have a serious event even without intervention. </p>

        <p>Wearing a parachute on an aeroplane.</p>
<p>We want to conduct a scientific experiment to examine the effectiveness of giving parachutes to all airline passengers.</p>
<p>We make two numerically identical groups of volunteers of 10million participants. The first group of 10M we give parachutes. The second group of 10 million gets no parachutes.</p>
<p>In both groups, we observe 1 person gets very drunk and jumps out of plane.</p>
<p>There was 1 death in the non-parachute group.</p>
<p>There was 0 deaths in the parachute group.</p>
<p><strong>Relative Risk Reduction</strong>
Giving all airline passengers parachutes prevents 100% of jumping deaths. (0 vs 1)</p>
<p><strong>Absolute Risk Reduction</strong>
Giving all airline passengers parachutes save 0.00000001% of jumping deaths (1 vs 10million)</p>

<p>I like calling out shilling as well</p>
<p>I had never heard his term before and was intrigued as to what it might mean, but not enough to DYOR, so I figured I’d ask to determine whether I should dig deeper</p>
<p>No reply yet, I’m assuming not</p>

        <p>I like the way you think. Clearly influence by the IDW. 
But, to be clear, these terms are objectively defined in many areas of statistics and not open for interpretation. Therefore, this is not a strawman argument. Infact, there is no argument I was making in my question. I would like to make an argument once I'll received and answer to my question. Aka an easier way to explain this difference. There were two great answers above. </p>
<p>I'm always open for discussion. Speak to someone as if they might teach you something 😉 am I right? </p>
<p>My objective is simple. Not easy, but simple. Another way to word my question is "how to you explain these statistical concepts in a way that the majority can understand?" I hope that is more clear.</p>

        <p>Being skeptical is generally a good thing. But what is the point of being skeptical if you cannot articulate why your skeptical? This is the point of my question. I was having difficulty articulating the difference between reletive effect and absolute effect with regards to risk/reward of the vaccine. You're right that a close minded person is a waste of time to speak too. But if I don't have the words when I speak with an open minded person, then I am a waste of time to speak too.</p>

        <p>Also- the opener "we all know" strikes me as the straw man argument.</p>
<p>Since I'm no scientist I have no inside track on actual research and the fact that the usual mainstream sources have outed themselves as propaganda spreading bullshit artists helping to deeply politicize the very concept of science, there's very little that any of us who are not epidemiologists actually "know" for sure.</p>
<p>At this point if a media talking head came to my door and called me by name, I'd need to chack my driver's license to make sure because AFAIC they've proven themselves to be liars.</p>

        <p>You got me there. It's a reddit title so I wanted to be direct. It should read more like "increasingly the data suggest..." but I don't think you would have clicked on a title like that. </p>
<p>I am close to the science and can say you still arrive at a good conclusion as the vast majority if the main stream media butcher the science and peddle a narrative. It's also so terrible that covid struck on an election year. </p>
<p>I would argue though that everyone needs some framework to base their opinions on. Some framework that leads to a thought process that leads to behavior. This literally could be anything. Belive in everything, nothing, religion, God, Devil, the spaghetti monster in the ski, your feelings, science. Humans have built thought frame works out of just about anything that results in a behavior. Some do better then others in certain contexts, and "we all" have thoughts one what frameworks yield better results, at the individual or collective level, but it is needed. Or you just won't get out of bed. </p>
<p>Point is, believe whatever you want and behave in a way that you think is right for you and your family. Just make sure you have a clear why that you can articulate and share with others when the right time comes.</p>

        <p>Always go deeper. The deeper you go, the less reliant on others you need to be. When you hit an obstacle, ask reddit. I received two great answers that will aid me moving forward to better explain these statistical concepts to a more majority audience</p>
