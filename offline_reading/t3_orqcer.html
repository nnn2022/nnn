    <strong>They cannot vaccinate the entire world.</strong>
    <p><p>It's all pointless.</p>
<p>The Delta/Gamma/Omega/Megatron variants are NOT coming from the USA. Some reports say that future variants (as in, variants from a few MONTHS from now, not years) will be completely immune to the vaccine. Israel is already saying the Pfizer is only 40% effective against Delta.</p>
<p>Even if you vaccinate 100% of the USA, 100% of the UK, 100% of France, etc, there will be new variants coming from Chile, Brazil, India, China, Vietnam, etc, etc, etc. These variants will get better and better at going around the vaccine.</p>
<p>The vaccine WILL become useless. It doesn't matter how many people get vaccinated in the USA or the UK. You cannot, and will not, be able to vaccinate the entire world.</p>
<p>This is rolling the stone up the hill only for it to roll back down. That's all it is. It's futile. And I think everyone knows it's futile.</p></p>

        <p>If they are actually suggesting that we all play whack-a-mole with every new variant that pops up and their only way of fighting that off is by continually chasing after it with a new and newer forced injection, then not only will it never work but it will also mean living in a world of unending forced injections possibly with compounded adverse effects worse than any strain they’re attempting to thwart. It’s madness, even if that worked it wouldn’t be worth it. </p>
<p>But what you’re describing is like a dream come true for pharma investors. It will not end with one forced injection. It will only open the door to unending forced injections. Just as all the freedoms we lost after 9/11 never came back once this is lost it is lost forever. But this time it’s not your privacy or taking off your shoes at airports, this is your body we’re talking about here, your one and only body. This will allow malicious untrustworthy parties to put whatever they want into your body whenever they want for as long as you live. It’s the only thing you really own in life and they want to lay claim to it now and forever. </p>
<p>You would have no power over your own body. You could be running one day to catch your train only to realize you’re much more out of breath than you used to be. What caused it? Maybe your muscles won’t respond as well and you won’t be able to lift as much weight. You’d have no cause or proof of the harm that had been done to you. The doctors won’t help you because they’re paid not to notice vexxine harm. And it’ll all be normal and unquestionable. I don’t want to live in a world where people I don’t trust have unrestricted access to my body without my consent.</p>

        <p>It could be worse than that. In theory, we could be making vaccinated people unable to fend off variants that otherwise would pose little risk to them. Then it goes from a waste of time and money to actually dangerous.</p>

        <p>That’s not true. The vaccine makes the virus work around it for survival. So it’s still going to mutate around the vaccine and infect the vaccinated and unvaccinated. But the unvaccinated will be effected more because they have no immunity. So it’s more dangerous to them.</p>

        <p>This is one of the reasons Brett Weinstein is arguing in favor of ivermectin. It’s an old medication with very few side effects and works as a preventative measure for covid according to some preliminary studies. If the virus has nowhere to spread to, it will become eradicated. The vaccines may help lessen the severity of covid for many but if it doesn’t stop transmission it’s basically like playing a hopeless game of whack a mole.</p>

        <p>As soon as Isreals data came out I knew the vaccine we currently have was turned obsolete. Sure, it was effective against the original strains, but new strains will keep coming out from countries that didn't pay millions to Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, etc for distribution. </p>
<p>I got vaccinated to protect my older and at risk family members from the original virus. Now I see that this will be a never ending chase your tail game with varients from other countries. I have a degree in Cell and Molecular Biology so my friends and family often ask me opinions about the vaccines and such (of course I back my words up with data and research articles from multiple sources) and I can say with confidence that getting vaccinated now will be worth nothing in the coming months as the virus breeds freely in less developed countries and finds new ways to change it's vectors of infection ever so slightly. </p>
<p>Anyone who tells you that you're the reason we have varients if you're in the US or another western country then  they're trying to catch the sand falling from their hands.</p>

<p>they were never effective to start with</p>
<p>those "100% protection against death and hospitalization" results came straight from Pfizer/Moderna</p>
<p>as soon as they were put to test, the whole house of card came down</p>
<p>statistically, it was clear from the start that they had zero impact on spread. Which is very weird in itself: how do you make a vaccine that protects 100% against the severe disease but is completely useless in stopping spread? It should have been at least <em>somehow</em> useful at stopping that, but the curve's shape was seemingly completely unaffected by the vaccination program</p>
<p>why should we ever trust Pfizer/Moderna? I mean, it sounds like a joke, but the studies and data that were used to grant emergency/marketing approval came 100% from Pfizer and Moderna - people think that there's some public oversight, and they're wrong. The only thing that the FDA and the EMA do is rubber stamp Pfizer and Moderna's own claims.</p>

        <p>I'm not referencing Pfizer or Modernas data when I say that, I'm referencing Isreals data when I cite effectiveness of the vaccine. No one has ever said 100% in any credible  documents or reports I read, nor is it remotely possible to create such a thing, so stop saying it. The most effective vaccines we've ever created have 99% reduction in cases. </p>
<p>https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2101765</p>
<p>This is the study I reference when I talk about Pfizer, it involved over 1 million Isreali people (much larger than Pfizer and Moderna trials combined) and had in my opinion a good experiment design with good controls comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated. Isreal exclusively uses the Pfizer vaccine as well so no 3rd party vaccine data was involved in this. </p>
<p>Based on their willingness to throw Pfizer's vaccine under the bus in the latest reports, I'd trust this study and their data when it comes to effectiveness. </p>
<p>In terms of how do you make a vaccine that prevents severe disease but is useless against spread? Could be possible if your immune system keeps the active infection below symptomatic infection levels. It's similar to HIV, it can be undetectable in your system thanks to antiviral drugs, but you're still infected, and can still pass on HIV without an active outbreak. Same with herpies. </p>
<p>If I was going to try and explain it, and someone gets infected with covid and they're vaccinated, that immune response will not be immediate, the virus will replicate and be available to be released by the respiratory system into the air. I don't believe we've come up with a viral load number as of yet, so until then do we know how many viral particles it takes to cause an infection? But if I assume that the immune response isn't immediate, or the immune response keeps the infection at a certain level below symptomatic infection, then I can see where it won't prevent spread but prevent severe illness. </p>
<p>To say EMA just slaps a rubber stamp on the vaccine is also inaccurate, in the approval process for Pfizer they had multiple objections to Pfizer's claims and sent them back to fix it multiple times. According to what I've read, Pfizer had to go back and prove what it was saying in terms of mRNA stability etc, because the data EMA obtained said otherwise and wouldn't move forward until it was fixed. Ultimately it got approved for emergency use, so I guess they fixed the issue. But to say they just go "yeah that looks good" is not correct. (I haven't read an FDA document so I can't comment on them)</p>

<p>Still, data comes from Pfizer. EMA has the option of either saying "we're good" or "come back with more". There's no direct oversight, nor there's any direct involvement of EMA in the studies themselves.</p>

        <p>I'm not exactly sure how to reference things in your response like you did to mine so I'll respond to each in a new paragraph lol</p>
<p>First, yes Astrazeneca does say that, for a 3rd stage trial analysis, which is BS. So I was incorrect in saying no one says that, but they were also basing it off their trial numbers and analyzing whatever they had at the time. I'd be speculative if I read that regardless. Notabley, it does say primary trial analysis, so it wasn't their final data. Real world data bumped that number down to 92% in June. Admittedly I was thinking more of symptomatic cases when I said nothing is 100%. But in regards to the vaccine nothing is 100% and they proved that with real world data, that vaccine mentioned was rated at only 60% preventing symptomatic infection.</p>
<p>What does it imply? Genuinely curious.</p>
<p>To say the vaccinated are varient factories can be applied to those who aren't vaccinated as well. There's a few cases where people keep testing positive for covid after showing no active infection. A paper I read recently showed that the virus can infect and insert itself into the DNA of certain cells in the human body. That would basically have the same effect as keeping infection below symptomatic levels. Also, if I'm using other viruses as examples, asymptomatic infection usually doesn't lead to viral mutations because the amount of viral replication cycles in non symptomatic cases is usually much lower than active infections where tons of cells are being infected and killed off when they're used as replication factories.... Not going to argue about whether I'm a varient factory or not, but seeing as the US hasn't created a varient yet of record I will hold off on that for now. </p>
<p>I'm not saying that they can or can't spread it, I was coming up with a hypothesis on how you would prevent severe illness but not stop spread, viral loads and viral amounts would point to that, which there doesn't seem to be much data on. On a side note, if vaccine efficacy is waning like Isreal says and people are getting sick but not hospitalized or dying, it would appear that at least the momory cells and antibodies to the original strains still do an effective job and preventing large scale infection within the body (ie. Cell death, organ damage) but most people focus on the symptomatic vs asymptomatic, etc. </p>
<p>You are correct, that is why I said I didn't use the manufactures data, I used Isreals data instead in their own separate trail involving many more people. </p>
<p>In conclusion, you were correct in that they do indeed say 100%, I don't usually consider manufactures data as credible because it's not peer reviewed, but that's just my education talking, normal people with no science background don't do that, hence misleading people on true data. Thank you for showing me that.</p>

<p>No True Scotman not allowed, sorry. Pfizer and Moderna claimed the same by the way.</p>

<p>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marek%27s_disease#Prevention</p>
<p>&rt; To say the vaccinated are varient factories can be applied to those who aren't vaccinated as well.</p>
<p>See above. Everything we have today points at natural immunity after infection to be a) sterilizing b) lifelong and c) more effective against symptoms than "immunity" gotten from these vaccines, or however we want to call them at this point</p>
<p>&rt;  There's a few cases where people keep testing positive for covid after showing no active infection.</p>
<p>A few cases? There's a gigantic mountain of those. In Italy, around 70% of "cases" are completely asymptomatic. Lots of people take <em>months</em> to negativize, hence why they've ruled that after 21 days you're good to go even if you don't get a negative test result.</p>
<p>&rt; A paper I read recently showed that the virus can infect and insert itself into the DNA of certain cells in the human body. That would basically have the same effect as keeping infection below symptomatic levels.</p>
<p>How so? Plenty of RNA viruses have reverse transcriptase into their sequences, doesn't mean they keep you permanently infected with themselves. Chickenpox/shingles is an example of the opposite - the virus "hides" in the spinal cord and waits for the immune system to weaken. Typically you get the shingles once, like you get chickenpox once. A virus can alter your DNA (retroviruses). Doesn't mean you are <em>permanently</em> infected with it. COVID is <em>not</em> a retrovirus nor it has retrovirus characteristics as far as I know, so if you have that paper feel free to link it.</p>
<p>&rt; Not going to argue about whether I'm a varient factory or not, but seeing as the US hasn't created a varient yet of record I will hold off on that for now. </p>
<p>"Yet" being the key word. Also, variants are nothingburgers. There hasn't been a new <em>strain</em> or SARS-CoV, again, <em>yet</em>. Leaky vaccines like the one they're using now will push the virus towards making those.</p>
<p>&rt; On a side note, if vaccine efficacy is waning like Isreal says and people are getting sick but not hospitalized or dying, it would appear that at least the momory cells and antibodies to the original strains still do an effective job and preventing large scale infection within the body</p>
<p>We will see about that. Hospitalization data is not encouraging. Remember, we're in July. The real test comes this winter.</p>

<p>Let me know if that link works for that paper regarding retrovirus like characteristics, though note it is a preprint. Yes I understand the method of action of chickenpox and shingles, I was saying that a potential explanation of why people continue to test positive while not showing symptoms could be partially attributed to the retrovirus-like action it takes in certain cells. </p>

        <p>As far as I understand it, their reasoning is the following:</p>
<p>People keep resulting positive to PCR testing weeks or months after the symptomatic infection has cleared from the system. Hence, there must be <em>something</em> that still generates the virus fragments that the test picks up. We hypotize that those fragments are generated by the infected person's own cell, because the virus manages to reverse transcribe itself into the infected person's cells DNA.</p>
<p>As a proof for their hypotesis they look for "chimeric transcripts", errors in transcription that typically happen during reverse transcription.</p>
<p>Their findings are to be taken with a gigantic grain of salt - their methodology is contrived to say the least, this is not my field of expertise but when I read a methodology section that is this long some alarm bells ring. Also, as far as I can see, they don't even mention quantitative results - they're saying that reverse transcription of SARS-CoV-2 to DNA is <em>possible</em>, <em>in vitro</em>, using their 5 pages long methodology. They're not claiming this happens during infection at all.</p>
<p>One would apply Occam's razor to a situation like this - what is more likely: that SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus, expresses retrovirus properties never seen in that class of viruses, which allows it to embed itself into the host's genome in such an effective way to be still shedding itself leaving no symptomatic trace for months or... the PCR test is bogus, especially if used at the amplification cycles they're using it in labs all over the world (&rt;40), like literally everyone that ever worked in a lab knows and has known since the start?</p>
<p>Hope I expressed myself clearly. Again, not my field of expertise, but I am used to reading papers... hope I haven't missed anything crucial.</p>

        <p>Most likely the latter with PCR testing, especially with the recent news on that front,  but one has to question as well...if SARS-CoV-2 is possibly the result of gain of function research, can you assume that it wouldn't show properties not seen in other coronaviruses?</p>
