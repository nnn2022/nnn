        <p>"Military deployed for control of movement" starting July 2021. That's right at the moment the new Basel III international banking regulations take effect (June 28, 2021) which, historically have been <em>extremely</em> destabilizing. This is the moment most people will lose their entire life savings.</p>

        <p>I’ve heard of the banking plans, but could you tell me some more about them? I’m just not sure how exactly it’s going to intertwine with everything going on. Basically, what does it mean for us?</p>

        <p>So you know that inflation eats away at your purchasing power, right? It’s very slow, but through decades of wealth loss for most people and an extreme concentration of wealth in the top 1%, the system has become incredibly unstable and risks a total collapse. History tells us that when we approach this moment, the people controlling the currency in circulation must "reset" the economy so it becomes more stable.</p>
<p>How do you reset a debt-based economy? By hyperinflating the currency away, which completely destroys all remaining purchasing power, then allowing precious metals (which must remain very cheap in order for an unbacked currency to "appear" to have any value whatsoever) to return to their fundamental value to society.</p>
<p>Once this happens, the currency can be pegged to precious metals again and all debts will be wiped out. The problem with this necessary process is history tells us it is extremely chaotic often resulting in mass famines and starvation, a spike in major crime, a complete loss of wealth for anyone not holding on to physical assets, and a major breakdown of society.</p>
<p>It’s going to get really rough for most people, which is probably why they are going to deploy the military to control everyone's movement. The good news is that the other side of this event has much greater prosperity with a more level financial playing field for everyone that survives. And this is the end goal of a reset.</p>

        <p>Basel III is essentially a new gold standard, globally. Currency has no intrinsic value and gold is all intrinsic value. When currency becomes worthless through a currency reset, all paper wealth goes to zero and gold returns to its fundamental value. After that, the currency is pegged to gold. It’s incredibly rare, but also <em>extremely</em> destabilizing. They will have to send out universal basic income to everyone on earth or humanity will face the largest mass starvation in history.</p>
