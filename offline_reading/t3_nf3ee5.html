    <strong>Questions from someone with opposing views...</strong>
    <p><p>Hi friends,</p>
<p>I'm generally considered someone who is a "pro-masker."  I still wear a mask when required, even when meeting up with friends.  And I will be getting the Covid-19 Vaccine. I'm coming in good faith to discuss some of your opinions as I am open minded and looking to possibly getting my views changed on the topic.  I see other people like me immediately dismissing you guys as "crazy," or "ignorant."  But personally I never liked dismissing someone's views as incorrect without having a discussion with them first.  Of course, I don't think you guys are crazy or stupid, just people with different views which I'd like to learn from and maybe vice-versa. </p>
<p>Basically all I want is for any of you reading to tell me about your opinion on masks, lockdown, and the vaccine.  And maybe why I shouldn't be fearful of Covid-19,  or why I should or shouldn't take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Also one more thing to note, you will more than likely see these people who have views similar to mine who are disrespectful and resort to insults immediately.  I hope you all can realize that most people aren't really like this these are just the vocal minority.  Most people are more open minded and respectful to opposing views than you may think.  I look forward to anything you guys say and any points you may make.  If you can, please provide sources to your points.  I'm typing this in the night so when I wake up I'll hopefully have a lot of comments to respond too.  Good night yall.</p></p>

        <p>Hi, and welcome.</p>
<p>On masks: </p>
<p>They only serve to reduce spittle from when people talk, cough, and sneeze. I get this. Anyone pretending they do anything else needs to read up more on what types of masks do what. They won't stop you getting the virus if someone coughs/sneeze in your direction and they have it. Generally, people coughing and sneezing shouldn't be out in public. </p>
<p>On lockdowns:</p>
<p>I think this is just political correctness gone mad. Instead of telling the elderly and vulnerable to isolate, they just told all of us to isolate. It makes no sense to incur massive debt to save the vulnerable. We should all have free choice, and this is a totalitarian reaction to a virus with over a 99% survival rate. </p>
<p>On vaccines:</p>
<p>If they hadn't gone so militant over alternative treatments, I might have believed that our best interests were being thought of. They were, so I don't. In the US, in particular, none of the vaccines could have gotten emergency use authorisations if an alternative treatment was available, so alternative combination treatments were totally ostracised, and outright banned to allow the introduction of vaccines.  Social media even banned people from sharing these treatments.</p>
<p>Besides the fact that I believe nobody should be forced to have a vaccine against their will, I am also hesitant to take any vaccine because the side effects are not being widely reported in the media. Transparency would have gone a long way to restoring my faith in the safety of these vaccines, but there has been zero transparency. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that the pharmaceutical companies have zero accountability in this whole farce sets off another red flag. Essentially, we're being used as guinea pigs in the largest human trial ever conducted, and if there are any claims to be made, we'll be paying those making claims through our taxes, not the pharmaceutical companies, and not the government. </p>
<p>Additionally, instead of launching a drive to get people to up their intake of Vitamin D, Zinc, Vitamin C, Magnesium, etc, and to get a lot more exercise to give them a better chance of survival if they do contract the virus, companies are offering free donuts to get people to take the vaccine. What type of medical advice is this?</p>
<p>Lastly, the acceleration of the green agenda and bandying about of the term 'Great Reset' sets off alarm bells everywhere. Nobody signed up for this, certainly not most who voted Republican in the US, and not those who voted Tory in the UK, yet here we are, having this forced upon us in the midst of a pandemic.</p>

        <p>I appreciate you summarizing your main beliefs, I never really was very skeptical as I personally always trusted science.  But this subreddit has made me question that just a bit.</p>
<p>One more question if you'd like to answer it.  Do you think that the use of advertisements on apps and websites such as YouTube and Spotify about masks, Covid-19, and the vaccine for it might attribute to misinformation being spread through the masses?  And could it also make people online who are opposed to you're views more aggressive towards you because of it?  I think it'd be really interesting to hear your take on this.</p>

        <p>I used to think I could trust science. Unfortunately it's not science when scientists are paid to produce research that points in a specific direction. </p>
<p>As for the endless propaganda we are seeing everywhere, of course it will make people think they are morally superior, and that those who choose not to blindly follow the masses are selfish.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are enough of us questioning the narrative &amp; we're not easily swayed by endless propaganda. </p>
<p>In all the years we've never had a vaccine for the common cold, and now we're supposed to believe they whacked multiple safe vaccines together in less than a year? </p>
<p>I am not a guinea pig.</p>

        <p>I'm not against masks but do think they are useless. The new info coming out now kind of proves that, with places saying that you don't need to wear one if you are vaccinated. There is little to no evidence to suggest that being vaccinated will stop transmission. So it's either that masks do not work, or they are quite happy for the unvaccinated to be more at risk for not doing as they are told. Which isn't exactly the message they have been giving out from the start by expecting us to take on the responsibility of every fuckers health. </p>
<p>The virus - well the data speaks for itself there. Its only really the elderly and vulnerable who are at risk from that. Yes, rarely it can apparently impact younger folk, but its rare. So again, if the vaccines work then the vast majority should be protected from that by now. Those who can't have the vaccine for whatever reason, wouldn't be better protected with the younger people vaccinated because transmission is still possible. </p>
<p>As for the vaccine, the younger you are, you are taking more risks getting the vaccine than you are if you just take your chances with covid. Why take a vaccine that hasn't undergone all tests and safety measures for a virus that isn't really going to have much impact on you? Long covid they say? Again, rare. </p>
<p>People think its selfish to not take a vaccine for the greater good, but is it really selfish to sacrifice your health for the sake of a few? We don't really know the long term effects from this so called vaccine. We don't really know how safe it is, and the more data that comes out about it proves that. Yet we are repeatedly told it is safe. It makes you wonder why they are so determined to tell us it is safe when they don't actually know this. Not to mention, those who really are at risk should already be vaccinated anyway. </p>
<p>And another note is that everyone is at a higher risk of suffering worse from the flu and yet this kind of pushing to get vaccinated never happened for that. Masks never happened for that. So why is this suddenly so important? I'd understand if people really were dropping on the street, and everyone really was impacted one way or another by this virus. But when you take your eyes away from the tv and speak to people in real life, it actually seems somewhat rare that people have been affected by covid. The most I have heard is someone testing positive, and they'd never have known if it wasn't for the test. Which the tests are questionable as well. </p>
<p>Oh and there is also evidence that suggests that those who have been vaccinated, if the vaccine fails and they do get covid, they will be impacted more than they would have been if they were unvaccinated.</p>
<p>So If I, a person at little risk from covid, take the vaccine to protect others then am I possibly putting myself at greater risk from covid AND potential unknown long term effects from the vaccine. It just doesn't seem worth it to me.</p>

        <p>Hey bro I appreciate the thorough comment.  I have a couple questions in relation to some of the points you made.  Just keep in mind that my knowledge on this subject is pretty minimal other than the basics.  So you might know a lot more than me.</p>
<p>Do you think its possible that the reason the COVID Vaccine is being pushed so much more than something like say, the flu shot, is not because COVID is some deadly disease with a crazy mortality rate, but because it would allow restrictions to be lifted?  Basically no one enjoys this distancing, mask requirements, and lockdown.  And everyone wants it lifted.  I would say for right now, that COVID feels like it has had a big affect on our day to day lives more than the Flu has, mainly due to the restrictions imposed by our governments. </p>
<p>Also, how long do you think it will take before you feel the COVID vaccine is safe enough to take?  Years, so you can truly see the long term effects for yourself?  Or do you think adequate evidence will be shown some time soon?  Do you think you would ever take the vaccine, even if it was safe?</p>
<p>Again, thank you for any input you give, its much appreciated for me to further understand.</p>

        <p>Covid in itself has not caused the effects on our lives. It is not the reason we face restrictions. That is the governments. It makes me question why they feel the need to do that to us and tell us that in order to get back to normal we must be vaccinated. There is no real hard evidence to suggest that should be the case. </p>
<p>Personally, I dont think that these restrictions will stop even if everyone was vaccinated. They'd shift the goal posts. New variants etc. They are doing that right now in the UK. They are already claiming that we may not be released from restrictions in June as planned due to the Indian variant. But, if the majority of the vulnerable and elderly are vaccinated, why would they even need to consider further lockdowns? If the whole reason for lockdowns was to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, and those who are most likely to need hospital treatment are now vaccinated...then how and why can they even mention further lockdowns. Either the vaccines do not work and they know this, or they're going to keep doing what they are doing in order to keep us locked down and controlled for whatever agenda they have going. </p>
<p>As for me getting the vaccine...for as long as I am at low risk from covid, I dont see the point in me getting it. I dont get the flu jab simply because I have never had the flu, and I'm still standing to say that I still haven't had the flu.</p>

        <p>Hi, its great you are open for discussions.
European here. </p>
<p>Look, to be personal, i believe and know corona is real and can be a life threat or even deadly. Both my parents had covid and were (very) symptomatic. not hospitalized, survived well. Still, nobody in our family has interest in taking the vaccine, same as most of my friends. 
We have differing opinions here and there but one thing we all agree on: the measures like lockdowns or forcing school kids to stay home or wear masks are absolutely disproportionate.</p>
<p>Now you might wonder, and i believe this is crucial, that we all appear to have a deep distrust in the "dangerous pandemic" narrative. Yes, for sure, we are careful with that - why? see here:
last pandemic, swine. flu, was unjustified scare by who:</p>
<p>https://www.bmj.com/content/340/bmj.c3033</p>
<p>Also, why no Covid-vaccine for us? Because we have no reason to trust these rushed jabs. See</p>
<p>rushed swine flu vaccine caused narcolepsy in children (and adults) https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3948</p>
<p>But even the politicians take the covid jab, so should they know if its dangerous? you tell me, what will be uncovered in a few months or years?? </p>
<p>"Concerns are growing in Germany about the safety of the swine flu vaccine that will be available to the general population after news was leaked last weekend that top politicians and some government employees will be given an alternative vaccine."
https://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b4335?tab=responses</p>
<p>Bottom line is: yes we compare covid a lot to the highly questionable pandemic of 2009 swine flu. that should make everyone skeptical i believe. from there you get a more skeptical when loooking at covid - i will leave these details to others. just wanted to provide you insights on WHY anyone COULD EVER be skeptical of WHO/scientists/pharma/politicians.</p>

        <p>I am totally oblivious to you choosing to wear a mask or you choosing to take the vaccine. I will also never resent you for your beliefs. If they are interesting I will listen to them. As long as you give the same respect to my autonomy as I give to your autonomy there is no problem. For example: if X is very scared of the virus by all means X should stay home and his job should even accommodate this desire, however X should not force me to stay home because he is scared of a virus.</p>

        <p>Hey dutchie,</p>
<p>you maybe have more realistic insights regarding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>will the "testsamenleving" really work? or are TOO many dutch against this?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will the vaccine (+ passport) really work as a "door opener" for events etc? or will it eventually just turn. into a yellow-fever-vaccine thing, which makes the covid vaccine only required for plane travels - which is already bad enough</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>do you have realistic insights on how many people 16 and older actually want the vaccine?</p>
<p>what do your fellow doctors say/think. about the whole covid situation &amp; these vaccines?</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to hear that people called you all that.  But just because I wear a mask when required doesn't mean I think you're a granny killer, white supremacist, domestic terrorist's etc. Just someone who I personally feel is wrongfully dismissed by the media and people who don't agree with you.  If you'd like, I would still enjoy hearing your personal views on the topic.  If not I understand, have a good day.</p>

        <p>For where I live it was required, at least when going into stores.  They wouldn't let you in.  For reference I lived in California but I moved about a couple months ago.  I'm not sure about the situation there now or in other places.  That was just my experience.  I think the reason people listen to the media is because its so in your face.

        <p>Masks have been scientifically demostrated to have no effect on infection transmission. The chance of being damaged by a vaccine that is still on trial until 2023 - that has no substantial safety data - is technology never successfully deployed against any corona virus (dead ferrets, etc) obviously there is a far greater chance of being damaged by such experimental toxins than there is from getting the common cold rebranded in a global propaganda campaign as a plague and an existential threat to humanity.</p>

        <p>I ask most people like you, who only seem to really mention the "Mask" this basic question:</p>
<p>How many of your friends and family and neighbors did you label "Non-Essential" last year?</p>
<p>I ask this, because you guys never seem to want to talk about that. You seem to think the only thing going on is "Wear a mask".</p>
<p>But that isn't the only thing going on, at all. How many hypochondriacs and agoraphobes and germaphobes were created by your policies? How many children have been traumatized into fearing socialization with their friends and neighbors and even family? At a time when it is the most important thing for them?</p>
<p>Try focusing on these parts a bit more, see what happens.</p>

        <p>Hey thanks for the comment.  I haven't labeled anyone Non-essential, I'm still a kid myself and haven't been thinking about it too critically until recently.  I'm not quite sure the mask thing or any polices pertaining to it has really traumatized anyone.  From what I've seen, people are still hanging out, just with a couple added steps.  Wear a mask, and don't be right up in each others face.  I will condemn any parent who makes their own children fearful of social interaction.  Most people just want to be safe, and that extends to their kids.  Of course, this is just what I've seen.  Other people could have their own experience that is different than mine. Most people are just fearful of COVID not social interaction.  For now I am too, I just came here to see if you guys had any evidence to suggest that I shouldn't be afraid.  And so far with the discussion I've had with others here all of your arguments have been convincing and do include evidence.  I was pleasantly surprised and have learned to be a little more skeptical when it comes to these topics.</p>

        <p>&rt;   I haven't labeled anyone Non-essential, </p>
<p>Yeah, it's interesting how everyone who supported the policies of labeling human beings "essential" and "Non-essential" claims they had no role in it.</p>
<p>&rt;I'm still a kid myself</p>
<p>That is certainly a better excuse. Good luck growing up.</p>
