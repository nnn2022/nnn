    <strong>I can't belive what my country has turned into.</strong>
    <p><p>I'm from Canada and I have been so grateful to live here and have been proud to be Canadian. I thought I lived in one of the freest countries in the world. Of course Canada wasn't perfect pre covid. No country was but I thought I was at least living in a top 5 country. </p>
<p>But what the hell has happened to this place? During the first wave I wasn't exactly happy about the lockdown but I at the time believed it was a nessasary evil in order to contain the virus. After provinces started going into 2nd lockdowns then I knew that this was a bunch of bullshit that has nothing to do with "protecting us".</p>
<p>Now one province has a curfew and the most of them don't let you have people in your own fucking house. They've also been fining people who are protesting this despite the fucking Prime Minister going to a BLM rally during the summer. So BLM protests are okay but covid protests aren't? The reason is because BLM doesn't involve our government so they don't give a shit unlike the covid protests.</p>
<p>I understand that people in much of Europe, Australia , Argentina, Chile, Honduras and probably a bunch of other countries have stricter lockdowns and I feel for you guys. However it seems based on talking to people from these countries that a lot more people are "awake" there compared to Canada (Although I've heard Australians are also like this) whenever I try to educate someone on what's really going on, most of the time they just think it's a dumb conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>I can't belive that Canada is actually doing this great reset shit Trudeau has fucking admitted it. Basically this NWO is pretty much turning our capitalist societies into a "neo-communism". This goes against everything my country stands for. Yeah we're more socialist then the USA but we're still a very capitalistic society.</p>
<p>Lots of the poorer countries which I was previously grateful for not living in, are honestly not looking so bad rn. Yeah Canada is more democratic and is richer than those countries but at the end of the day does that shit really matter? Like does being able to vote in a fair election or having more money make up for not being able to have people in your own fucking house or having a bedtime decided by your government? Yeah it would be nice to have all of those things but if I had to choose, I'd choose having the government not put in bullshit restrictions that don't do shit.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to move somewhere else eventually idk where yet but I see no future here. Most Canadians will be happy once the great reset is completed as most are a bunch of sheep.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long rant. I'm just so done with everything rn.</p></p>

        <p>Man...I'm literally sitting here sick thinking the exact same thing.  I used to boast about how lucky I was to live in the best country on the planet and IM SHOCKED that not only have we slid so far so quickly, but that people, CANADIANS, are behaving this way.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is the cornerstone of a free and democratic society, the absolute foundation on which all other freedoms are built upon.  It is something I as a Canadian take very seriously fro obvious reasons, and it shocks me how this fundamental right is being dismantled incrementally in such an insidious manner. </p>
<p>What people seem to forget so quickly is that right and freedoms come at a price.  Ask any 19 year old Canadian kid on Juno beach or Ypres what that freedom costs.  I honestly believe that Canadians have had it so good for so long with so little asked in return that we forget about our responsibilities as citizens of this great land.</p>
<p>I come from a background in activism, some of it borderline militant, and it's obvious what we need to do.  You won't see in on the news but activists all around the world have been calling out Canada to shake off the complicity and do something.  We need to organize and plan.  We need to take up the same tactics as those who wish to destroy our way of life and blatantly usurp the fundamental rights and freedoms that so many Canadians before us fought and died for and that supersede any government or group because of their fundamental necessity. </p>
<p>I'm working on taking action as we speak but won't discuss it here.  PLEASE...PM me if you feel you have any skills or even just passion to contribute.</p>

        <p>Yeah it's fucking insanity. Canadians are far too compliant. What worries me is that any lockdown critical discourse will get you fired if you work in a medical field, politics, etc... It's literally treated like "wrongthink"</p>
