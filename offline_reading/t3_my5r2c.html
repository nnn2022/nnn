    <strong>Out of curiosity, how many of you / your family members have had adverse events with vaccines before this whole “new normal” thing?</strong>
    <p><p>I get the feeling that people who have been vaccine-injured, or who have had a family member who was vaccine injured, are generally more awake to everything that’s been going on lately.</p>
<p>How many of you have been through it before? It’s something about the entire experience: the gaslighting, denialism, lack of informed consent, coverup, dishonesty, corruption... when you have a bad experience with a vaccine everyone treats you like you’re insane. </p>
<p>I think that experience sort of prepares you to see what’s happening right now with this level of insanity.</p></p>

        <p>Of our 4 kids we only vaccinated our eldest. We didn't notice anything adverse immediately, but over time it seemed like his immune system struggled to fight off any little bug. Fast forward 10 years and it's night and day difference between him and the other 3 when they each get the same bug. He stays sick longer and has more severe symptoms almost every time. He's also the only one with allergies (dairy and gluten). Yes this could all be coincidental, but I've heard many similar stories. Just wish somebody would do a meta-analysis study on long term outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated.</p>

        <p>Both of my older brothers have sensory disorders and some neurological issues. My mom often recounts the extreme behavioral change one of them had directly after the MMR shot. She got suspicious after that and held off on a lot of the vaccines for me, and I’m the only one who’s completely healthy. I’m not totally convinced the vaccines caused their issues in this case, but I’ve always been aware of vaccine injury. I’ve read a lot of medical journals related to vaccines and vaccine injury, and once you know what to look for, you see it everywhere. It’s scary but mostly frustrating that vaccines are treated like a dose of Tylenol—everyone does it, it’s harmless, it’s no big deal, you’re paranoid if you think it’ll hurt you. I’m not antivax but I’ve always been an advocate for body autonomy and I vehemently despise the peer pressure surrounding vaccines. NO medical intervention is cut and dry, it should be a discussion between patient and doctor and no one else’s business. There are severe risks to vaccines and I’m SO sick of everyone invalidating those concerns because they’re “so rare”. They exist, they happen, and you’re naive if you think the majority of adverse events aren’t being swept under the rug.</p>

        <p>Exactly! I can relate to that.
I wouldn’t be surprised if it was the MMR that gave you brother neuro issues. It seems not so uncommon with that shot... all these learning disorders, autism spectrum, etc.</p>

        <p>Personally I don’t know anyone who has had an adverse reaction to a vaccine up until this covid shit (who doesn’t know someone who has at this point?) I’ve had all the standard ones and I’m fine.</p>
<p>But my family member hasn’t gotten her kids any and they’re all fine and extremely healthy, for what it’s worth.</p>

        <p>Damn, that’s really scary.
I never knew until recently how dangerous flu shots are.
What happened to her?</p>

        <p>All vaccines have risk, they have all caused injury and death. </p>
<p>The only difference is now there are no animal trials, it's a new type thats never been given enmass to a population before, and it was rushed to market </p>
<p>Since I am not obese or at retirement age, the risk is very high in reference to my last paragraph to get vaccinated versus no risk, as I already had COVID, and it was like a mild cold with a cough that lasted 3 weeks.</p>

        <p>Personally, I have a thing where I literally cannot touch/feel certain textures, or I get very anxious. This includes needles, which I’m terrified of, but can suck up my fear if I NEED the shot (like Tetanus or something, I don’t want that). However, I once received the flu vaccine as a child, and started throwing up. Something about the texture is just very wrong to me. I haven’t received another optional vaccine since.</p>
