    <strong>We need to do better.</strong>
    <p><p>I joined this sub because I like free thinking, I enjoy the idea of freedom and the willingness to take ideas and discuss them openly and without judgement. I wonâ€™t be taking the vaccine because I donâ€™t think itâ€™s safe. Iâ€™m against forcing people to take the vaccine because it takes away freedom, and I donâ€™t think itâ€™s okay to tell people what to think or what to believe because itâ€™s totalitarian and wrong. </p>
<p>Iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of people in this sub trying to tell those who believe in the msm narrative they canâ€™t or berating them or insulting them, we cannot become the thing we are trying to fight. If someone wants to wear a mask, go for it, if they donâ€™t, go for it. We are free to choose what we do, think what we think and act how we act so long as itâ€™s not infringing on someone elseâ€™s right to do so or broaching coercion.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s try to let people decide whatâ€™s right for them, if you donâ€™t want coercive measures and people pressuring you into taking the vaccine, donâ€™t coerce or pressure them not to.</p></p>

        <p>I agree.   The only thing I want is freedom to choose what's right for me.    And that's what I'll defend for anyone else as well.</p>

        <p>I get what you're saying but I think it's too late in the game for niceties. </p>
<p>This is about to get ugly. What are the mental health and societal repercussions of biologically compromised, genetically modified and hopelessly condemned shot takers wandering around communities all around the world? If you think they hate us now, wait until they are told that the only people with a healthy future are the unstuck!! Rather than admitting their errors, many will be seeking explode with hate and rage at having been duped into an early death filled with untold suffering before mercy delivers it's final blow. Millions of the Kool Aid Hair People will become zombie-like. And what do zombies do? They seek to devour or infect the healthy!!</p>
<p>The time to become aggressive and bombastic is NOW! We are trying to help these people but our patience is wearing thin. If it offends some, they are already gone.</p>

        <p>You get an upvote from me, as I agree with your sentiment. </p>
<p>However, here is just one example of someone who kept hounding me for trying to follow in your footsteps when I simply said "I do me, you do you, my body, my choice. I'm not taking the shot": </p>
<p>&rt;"Except that COVID is a public health emergency, and your individual choice to refuse a vaccine means that you can be a carrier at a much higher rate than those who are vaccinated, which prolongs the pandemic and continues to make it dangerous for people who truly can't take the vaccine (because they've had an organ replacement for example, not because they're stupid)."</p>
<p>No matter how civil or logical we try to be, these pro-vaxxers are pushing their agenda down our throats.</p>

        <p>I also agree that teaching is better than being a jerk, but I refuse to "tone police" this sub like this.</p>
<p>If it's the vent thread, expect venting. This is one of the few places on the internet where it's ok to express your frustration about what's going on. While I don't think it's productive, I don't think a false-paternalism is productive either.\</p>
