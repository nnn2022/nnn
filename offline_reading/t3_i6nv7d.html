    <strong>More normal setting in</strong>
    <p><p>So I live in Tempe, AZ where Arizona State University is. It’s move in week and it feels like it. Hotel parking lots are full, campus is buzzing, traffic is absolute madness (normally this would tick me off but this year it’s a sight for sore eyes). The burrito spot I go to is teeming with college kids after a slower summer. Dorms have people going in and out. Only difference is mask wearing but otherwise everything looks exactly like it did when I moved in about 13 years ago. And it’s wonderful.</p>
<p>I’m so glad my alma mater didn’t bow to fear. I’m so glad my school is mostly off campus housing. Even if something went sideways, majority of everyone lives in town and not on campus which would keep business and the town afloat. I’m proud to be a graduate of a level headed institution!</p></p>

        <p>weak people feel power by enforcing this.  They feel strong because of the backing of the majority.  It gives them importance and they get virtue-points.  They might actively think this way but this happens subconsciously.  "They are with science and you are not.  You must bow"</p>

        <p>Exactly. I can't imagine not seeing faces, micro expressions are vital to communication. Sharing a smile with a stranger. Seeing faces is an important part of being human. It's not natural. </p>
<p>Plus I would be screwed if it came here where I am due to personal trauma, but ignoring that it's not natural and it's unnerving to see masked faces everywhere. You're not getting vital perceptual information from the faces around you.</p>

        <p>I fucking hate when people try to argue, "But you have no problem wearing pants!!!" like they are at all analogous. Our faces are our unique identifiers, our legs aren't. They're how we communicate and express ourselves. They give life color. Life with masks is a gray, bland hellscape. I'm kind of mystified that more people don't recognize this.</p>

        <p>Exactly. We don't need to see each other's genitals to identify one another, we haven't evolved to vitally rely on each other's genitals for communication, or for socialisation vital for our health... </p>
<p>No, no, that is faces.</p>
<p>I do think these people are ignorant of role faces have in perception, communication, health and wellbeing, basically psychology.</p>

<p>I mean not every cop or person is a nazi. Some will accept your health justification. If a store or a driver knows you suffer from immense ptsd then they might be willing to make an exception. There are loads of people still reasonable if you let them know in advance.</p>

        <p>Here we don't have enforced masks and few wear them. Yet. Hopefully ever. However, I'm concerned about and feel for those in countries and areas that do. Many of those people are so vulnerable. From people I know, or have seen in support groups, a note doesn't help much. They're being stared and pointed out, had people confront them, some have been screamed at, approached with aggression.</p>
<p>Some virtual signaling businesses and locations are gleefully announcing NO EXCEPTIONS ALLOWED. My friend in the USA goes to a Halloween event every year, I think it is some sort of haunted thing. They advertised that at this point it was still on this year, but gleefully added MASKS COMPULSORY NO EXCEPTIONS. Then, added further something along the lines of "if you apparently have breathing difficulty and say you cannot wear a mask, then this event isn't for you so stay home".</p>
<p>My friend was celebrating their strong stance, <em>no assholes who don't care about others claiming they can't wear masks</em> was her attitude.</p>
<p>People quite literally don't care. They especially don't care about mentally health and since it's become socially acceptable to say mental health is pretty much irrelevant and selfish... people are openly saying so. People who once shared mental health awareness and suicide awareness posts, posts encouraging people to please ask for help, pretending to care because it made them look good. </p>
<p>It's mask it or shut it you selfish prick. People actually think there's no genuine reason.</p>

        <p>I'm glad that the college is open but I still hate the mask wearing. To me, that is not a sign of normal. I like hearing that people are out and about and moving in. But I can't imagine having to wear a mask while I'm moving into a dorm or off campus housing. That sounds like a nightmare. When masks become a thing of the past, then I will feel confident that we are back to normal.</p>

        <p>Here in Edmonton, I see more people wearing masks now in August than I did in March, April, May or June. Which is odd, considering that deaths &amp; hospitalizations peaked and since cratered, months ago. Official modeling showed up to 32k people would die in our province, 208 have died so far (Alberta has &rt;4 million people).</p>
<p>I'm looking for a new place to live now. South Dakota or even, Iceland, Japan, Sweden.. I don't know. At least the rural areas here in Alberta do seem less insane.</p>

        <p>El Hefe on Mill is open because they serve enough food but they’re more known for having a drink. A lot of the breweries are open because they serve food as well. I think gyms just won their right to open despite our state government trying to keep them closed. I think bars and clubs will open when it cools down and they’re  able to make outdoor set ups for bars and dance floors. Couple more months. We have the lowest rate of spread in the country right now so it’s all promising.</p>
