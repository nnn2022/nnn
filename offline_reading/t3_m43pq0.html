    <strong>"Covid" is yet another cover-up for overproduction crisis (study Marxism to know why)</strong>
    <p><p>I have repeatedly posted evidence for the fact that "covid-19" is yet another scam that the current ruling class of capitalists is using in order to cover up a massive crisis of overproduction. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownCriticalLeft/comments/ljpnm7/exploring_the_global_crisis_blamed_on_the_fake/">https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownCriticalLeft/comments/ljpnm7/exploring_the_global_crisis_blamed_on_the_fake/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Foot and mouth disease, swine flu, bird flu, African fever of swine have all been used to cover up attempts to overcome overproduction in the food industry (in 2019 in China, for instance, 100 millions pigs were destroyed under the pretext of "incurable African fever of swine". Capitalists simply made up/invented an excuse ("deadly pandemic") to destroy surplus product, the excess of which makes their profits plummet, so they have to curtail production and get rid of that extra product.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>"Covid-19" has exactly the same function. It covers up capitalists' attempts to climb out of a massive economic crisis, at the heart of which always lies the crisis of overproduction. They need to curtail production, cut the workforce, cut their expenses on social sector (education, healthcare etc), they need to find new sources of profit (hence the destruction of small capitalists to replace them on the market and forcing people to buy a product they don't need - masks, vaccines, etc.), they need to demoralize and divide hired workers so they don't unite and fight back, etc etc.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>If you find that this seems to be the only logical explanation for what is happening and if you want to be able to see right through all the BS that is being thrown upon us at the moment and find the way out, you need to study Marxism. Because the above explanation - is a Marxist explanation. It's Marxist political economy.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I would like to share this course, which is basically summarized Marxism. <a href="https://work-way.com/en/2021/03/09/crash-course-on-marxism-by-mllm-work-way/">https://work-way.com/en/2021/03/09/crash-course-on-marxism-by-mllm-work-way/</a></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It contains basic concepts, the essence of Marxist political economy, dialectical materialism and additional topics. At the moment, most of the articles are awaiting translation. We don't have enough people, so if you want to contribute as a translator, PM me.</p></p>

        <p>Communists societies were never stateless or classless. They were always saying they were, though.</p>
<p>In USSR there were at least three classes: workers, party members and free party members. The difference between party members and free party members is that the latter ones were freed from the duty of working (refusing to work was a criminal offence over there). Any management position was reserved for party members, and in those decisions party members were always obligated to listen to recommendations of free party members. </p>
<p>Privilege is more fun in a communist state, because it is not related to money, and therefore you can't join the upper class by finding or stealing a million dollars. Bezos realized a long time ago money is worthless. Making another 100 billion in digital currency doesn't bring him any happiness at this level. He wants the level of privilege people in Stalin's politbureau had, and they didn't have any money. They didn't need money.</p>
<p>By 'stateless' they meant absence of 'imperialist state', but every communist state is totalitarian, and the state gets involved in literally everything.</p>

        <p>Excellent post. I like your point about deadly pandemics being used to destroy surplus goods.</p>
<p>The economic reset already took place in 2004. Last year, their satanic celebrations went public.</p>
<p>One reason for destroying small businesses is to provide more fuel for the financial services industry. Contractors/self employed people have unstable incomes, so banks don't like to lend to them.</p>
<p>But after small businesses have been made bankrupt, some of those self-employed people will have to go work for the big corporations. This increases the number of potential borrowers.</p>
<p>The world wars were primarily about forcing people to use government currency on a much more frequent basis.</p>
<p>The lockdowns are based on a similar motive.</p>

        <p>I read the linked post, and it’s more batshit than a Wuhan meat market. Chinese exports have quickly gone through the roof in response to Covid. This year there was barely a lull at CNY, when normally Chinese exports grind to a halt.</p>
