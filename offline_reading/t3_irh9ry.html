    <strong>Do the doomers actually believe this is all temporary, or are they just submitting at this point?</strong>
    <p><p>I've lost hope that the world will not stay in this constant state of fearmongering, government monitoring, police state, social media justice, etc. Most of the people I know are hoping to return to normal and acknowledge this is all surreal and insane. On the other hand, I have some friends that are living in fear, swallowing whatever MSM tells them and feel this is all appropriate, even with acknowledgement of the grossly negative consequences. I honestly no longer believe that this will all go away, and the people who crave normalcy will try to resume normal life as much as allowed but it will always feel like this constant cloud of doom. Is there anywhere in the world where it doesn't feel like this? I don't even watch the news, but a task as simple as walking to my grocery store for one item has become an annoyance because of all the covid bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>Idk about some of the crazies here on reddit, but I think most people, including those that are pro lockdown, want and expect things to go back to normal, likely when a vaccine is released and distributed.</p>

        <p>I think it’s possible it will mostly end after the election here in the US. I would guess at least half of the media and politicians that are pushing this are motivated by politics. While there will still be a minority of people fervently pushing it I bet it won’t have the same stranglehold over our lives that it does now.</p>

<p>Yes, the US election will play big in the world’s timeline. It’s obvious that the Democrats are rooting for both more covid chaos and more economic pain. They figure it’ll help them to win.</p>
<p>After the election it’ll all go away. Trump will probably win anyway, but the economy isn’t coming back. The economic hole is already too big.</p>

        <p>The economic crisis certainly will not go away. As to the covid part, look around the world. China is already 100% back to normal. In Sweden, Holland no masks. Lots of countries never locked up.</p>
<p>So it’s hard to believe the US will continue lockdowns after the election.</p>

        <p>President Trump nationalized the fed and is moving us off the debt-backed central banking system we’ve been on since the 70s back to the gold standard. Economy will rebound , he knows what he’s doing. Shutdown was artificial the rebound will be massive.</p>

        <p>&rt;I can’t believe that we have to put life on hold until a vaccine.</p>
<p>Any idea of a safe &amp; effective vaccine any time soon is a pipe dream. The authorities tried to develop an effective flu vaccine for many years, and it’s still ridiculously ineffective. Just look at the official stats.</p>
<p>While the masking craziness will probably peter away relatively soon, I predict that the economy isn’t coming back for many years to come. So the old pre-2020 world is probably not coming back, alas. There’s going to be a lot more economic pain. Just wait until the stock markets crash bigly probably some time next year.</p>
<p>So the PTB will try to maintain the Orwellian world we’re seeing now just trying to keep the sheeple down.</p>

        <p>One thing that worries me most is that the most ardent doomers and social media warriors have found an easy vehicle for their self righteous ego trips. Everyone in this camp is A, B, C and everyone in that camp is X, Y, Z and now they think their hatred and fear and hostility is <em>justified</em> against the other camp because this is all done “for the greater good.” They can snitch, call the cops, gleefully celebrate death and despair, mock their neighbors, chastise their friends, all because they’re that sure they’re the ones saving the world and everyone else not following the rules is destroying it. Data and the original point of any of this be damned. It’s setting a very strange cult-like groupthink mentality that will not be easily taken away or deprogrammed. </p>
<p>I’m sure as this progresses more people will break off and admit this was all a major overreaction and  like myself months ago, admit they were wrong like I admit I was wrong. These are, I hope, the majority of people silently submitting and seeing how this plays out until they reach their own breaking point. I think the vaccine and maybe a couple months following that will be the turning point for most people. Because after that the purpose of all of this is truly going to be hard to try to defend, because to what end are we doing it?</p>
<p>The people remaining though, will be a force to reckon with for a long time, maybe even years. Until the social discourse and narrative changes at least so they lose power.

        <p>I’m in Ontario, Canada and I have some hope that the school reopening will accelerate some of this. It is already widely acknowledged that kids are not following the restrictions very effectively. When this doesn’t cause the system to become overwhelmed, won’t sensible people have to admit that it’s security theatre? There are more and more people who are not really worried. When they see an opportunity to stop the ruse that exists only to appease the frightened, I think they’ll take it. I give it a couple more months, until the weather turns and we have a choice between a bleak winter cooped up in our bubbles, or taking our chances on living life.</p>

<p>I agree with everything except the notion of a reckoning. </p>
<p>This is just one more facet of the woke ideology that is on the march in every street and every institution in America. The categorization, the hatred, and the witchhunting are endemic to their ideology. The creation and purging of demons shall continue, under this guise or under another. There is no reckoning coming. The woke ideology owns every media outlet, every major corporation, and will eventually steamroll straight to the head of government. We are in their "revolution" now, and have been for some time.</p>

        <p>Barring some massive event that makes everyone stop giving a shit and move on its going to be a long one.</p>
<p>I’m in Melbourne, Vic. No one even mentions the massive bushfires from January anymore, they’ve completely disappeared from public discussion. </p>
<p>I think the idea of NoNewNormal is something on the inside. An attitude, more than a protesters cry. </p>
<p>I’m reminded of a quote of a quote from George Orwell:
<em>Dare to be a Daniel,
Dare to stand alone,
Dare to have a purpose firm,
Dare to make it known.</em></p>
<p>Being in the resistance to the cult is going to suck and be isolating, the arguments are going to be frustrating, but it’s better than living in fear against your own human nature, and I think it will pay off.</p>
<p>No one actually likes what’s going on, and in time it’ll reach a tipping point where they get fed up. It’s too much negative social change too fast. They’ll start reaching out to people around them for reassurance in their skepticism and to feel their own humanity.</p>

        <p>not ending without mass revolt or some kind of international tribunal to hold perpetrators to account for crimes against humanity. the agenda is continuing forward regardless of any protests. the agenda is the World Economic Forum's "The Great Reset" which Fauci has now spoken out saying the same things. It all ties into United Nations Agenda 2030 that 190+ nations signed onto. Hence the WHO parroting the same mantra along with most "leaders" of countries.</p>
<p>Let this sink in, even Sweden has signed on for immunity passorts. That is something currently being trialed in Ireland  The US and Canada signed on for them as well and there is now talk of it in Ontario.</p>
<p>While we argue about who did better or worse, lockdowns, mask mandates, the safety of covid vaccines and the possibility of "mandatory" vaccinations, the agendas above continue unabated, with the groundwork to coerce you into the system regardless of mandates already laid.</p>

        <p>I'm not optimistic. The government here in the UK comes up with an excuse to introduce further measures every few weeks. Masks were not mandated on public transport until several months after the initial lockdown, then a few weeks after that they were mandated in stores. Now we are set to be restricted to only meeting up with five other people from tomorrow. There are also disturbing curfews being enacted in local areas, and an anti-lockdown protest a couple of weeks ago ended with the organiser (brother of a prominent politician) being fined thousands of pounds, even though it was far from the first public protest since March. </p>
<p>The real 'fun' could be yet to come. There are rumours of a 'Covid marshalls' being appointed to police the streets and a 'Covid hotline' being set up to report on supposed rule breakers.</p>
