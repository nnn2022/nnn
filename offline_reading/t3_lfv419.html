        <p>It's not a vaccine. It is a gene therapy and you are absolutely right not to trust it with the 20 YEAR long history of problems with gene therapies.</p>
<p>In fact numerous times the damned gene therapies WHOLESALE KILLED every single lab animal that was given them!</p>

        <p>First thing, the Covid 19 jab is not a vaccine, it is an experimental therapy.</p>
<p>The jab does not protect a person from the Sars-cov-2 virus. It supposedly lessens the severity of symptoms which is Covid 19. This is just one of the lies among many during this plandemic.</p>

        <p>Try to withhold it, I think you mean to say. last time they tried crap like that 60 years ago in the United States (Yeah, they tried it back in the MLK days) the populace said a resounding "NYOPEY!" and they had to back down because people were literally calling for rebellion if they kept on pushing it.</p>

        <p>I don't think much will happen. There's a lot of hype around it, but the moment someone will actually start making it mandatory, they'll also need a way to force people to disclose their medical records, and that just won't stand.</p>

<p>Laws are not immutable and with the coup now complete and their total control over all three branches of the government, the media and the banking industry they can change whatever the fuck they want.</p>

        <p>I think election is a different story entirely. You cast your ballot and you don't know what really happens after that. You can only speculate of you want to be honest at least with yourself. But when they demand from you that you disclose something that you know is guaranteed to be private information, there's no "maybe this, maybe that" anymore.</p>

        <p>They can try it but it won't work and let me tell you why.</p>
<p>There is a large percentage of people on this planet that spend every day just doing their job, going home, chilling with the fam or alone, that really don't pay attention to all this bullshit.  They'll mask up when they have to but they don't really want to.  So they just live their lives.  But if you tell them they have to take an injection just to be able to go out to eat they'll start resisting and going crazy.  You see about 10% of the people on either side of the debate are rabid and outlandish.  The other 90% thinks their side is right and aren't.  But what we're not seeing is the 40% of the rest of the populace that doesn't live on the internet and I'm talking people of ALL ages.  Hell I know a bunch of teenagers that don't even know what reddit is but I can tell you that every single one of them that I've spoken to are fed up with this mask shit.  Same goes for 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, and so on (I know a lot of people).  I have not one to date say they'd voluntarily take the shot.  So what we have here folks is a huge minority looking for the 'magic pill' that has already been shown to be a giant fail in curtailing the spread such as it is.. and it aint that much.  Eventually people are going to go 'hell no' and start digging their heels in.  Now politicians want nothing more than to get re elected.  When they start seeing a majority son 'fuck that shit' they'll change their tunes and right quickly.  I predict this is all going to be over around July.  August at the latest.  I may be wrong but I think  you're going to start hearing small soundbites that CORONA isn't as bad as first start from politicians.  Then they'll start getting 'progressive' as they see their poll numbers rise just so they'll seem attractive to their constituents.  And all this bullshit and the house of cards they've built will be taken slowly down bit by bit.  They can't afford to let it crumble too fast.  But down it's going to come.  I'd bet money on it.  </p>
<p>But wait there's more.  Give it 10 years.  Something else will come down and they'll pull another and even worse one.  The experiment has been run but some things didn't work.  They have to refine their plans and try again for enslavement.  But these people think in decades down the road.  Not next year or the next.  And we are all just pawns to them.  Well some of us are.  I don't play the game.</p>

<p>Exactly right, these people are playing the long game.</p>
<p>This wasn't the first time they ran a plan. 
Each time they learn a little more, and develop the master plan a little better. 
The events are spaced out just enough to keep most people from connecting the dots.</p>

        <p>as of right now, they can’t officially mandate something authorized under emergency orders. In order to officially mandate it, it will have to be FDA approved. So... that buys some time.</p>

        <p>We’re at the beginning of a new way of living. Those who don’t conform to this new ideology will be removed from society and pushed to the fringes. </p>
<p>You’ll be a pariah. Shamed and ridiculed by the programmed masses. It’ll be like being a Christian in a Muslim village in Syria. </p>
<p>Technology, AI and automation are rapidly accelerating. So much so that employment will be non existing in 5-10 years. </p>
<p>When that happens, universal basic income will be ushered in. But you won’t get UBI unless you’re a good little citizen. </p>
<p>The non-compliant people will form small communities in the rural areas. They’ll be shunned and avoided as “dirty people.” </p>

        <p>Here's my theory: once the 'vaccinated' start getting sick and dying and/or another virus is released, there'll be so much panic and fear that most of the laws (well, whatever semblance of them are left) will be completely shredded. Forced quarantines will become forced detention centres and finally concentration camps. I am starting to see this ending with Zyklon B showers for those who will NOT comply. </p>
<p>Look at Germany where they've stated that they'll quarantine/detain people in the current illegal migrant camps. No-one has bothered to ask WHERE the migrants will be housed and I suspect that these people may end up on the death statistics.</p>

        <p>The thing is also they have zero clue how long immunity lasts or how many boosters you will need for how many variations of the disease. There is no way a vaccine passport will even work as intended so I don’t see them actually doing it. And if all they need is a card shown at the door, easy to fake.</p>

        <p>In the US, not a thing. We've vaccinated millions of people already and have not set up some sort of central database tracking who's in and who's out. People who get their shot get a card listing which type of vaccine they got and when, so that they know which to get for shot #2.</p>
<p>There's no registry, no proof, and no app to show if challenged. And with so many people in the US that have tested positive (and many that have been infected that have never tested), we have a sizable portion of our people walking around with antibodies to the virus. They have no need for a vaccine. It'd be like giving a measles shot to someone who had it as a kid.</p>

        <p>Aaaaaannnnndddddd I throw the bullshit card on this one. 
Every one of those "vaccine cards" that is filled out has your demographic information on it. 
And the date, time, location, and specific vial of the vaccine you received. 
If you don't think that data is being compiled you are fooling yourself.</p>

        <p>Yes, but you fill your personal info in. There are states collecting that info for their records (since vaccination is carried out through the individual states), but there is no central database collecting all that info in the federal government. </p>
<p>The card is for you, for reference. I'm sure someone might accept it as "proof" that you've had both doses, but the data is handwritten. It'd be nothing to copy the relevant data from someone's card.</p>
