    <strong>My experience with a pro "New Normal" family</strong>
    <p><p>I have finally found a person to live with that made it possible to leave this situation, but I wanted to share my experience. I am sick to death of people acting like "no one thinks this way" when I complain over what the new normal has caused. </p>
<p>Before March my family insisted that we would just "be careful". Having the ability to walk, go on hikes, bike and skate are a huge deal to me. I am an extremely active outdoors person, and I average around 12 miles of steps a day under normal circumstances. They said "of course you can still do that, just stay away from others". </p>
<p>I could have lived with that. </p>
<p>I also was in between jobs and doing babysitting only while applying for my dream job. I was excited to hopefully get it. </p>
<p>Then March 9th happens. I announce I'm going on a walk. Alone. Away from crowds or even people at all. This is when I'm hit with "oh! And you're going to get infected and come back and kill your entire family?".</p>
<p>I was then told that if I left the house it would be seen as physical assault. I was told I wasn't allowed to go outside at ALL until the virus was gone, which was expected to be years. </p>
<p>I had already sunk so much money into the family that I couldn't move out on my own, my friends didn't want me to even visit due to the pandemic (let alone live with them), and I was demanded to decline my job offer when I was called and told I was hired a few days later. </p>
<p>We cloroxed all the groceries for over a year that were delivered to the house. My step mom was told to "die" after she forgot to Clorox a literal letter and put it on the table once. We couldn't sit in the yard. We couldn't open the windows. I couldn't even wear a hazmat suit 12 miles out in the forest even if I had wanted to as "it blows in the wind and lives for 3 hours in it". My scooter (bought with my own money) that I left in the front yard on the 8th of March was also promptly thrown out since the outside air apparently tainted it. </p>
<p>I spent 13 months sitting in a very small house in a room that was mostly a bed all in the name of "health". I was told we were following the science while I had to watch the news suggest taking a walk to ease your stress and being forbidden for doing it unless I wanted to be tackled to the ground. </p>
<p>This kept up after they were fully vaccinated in February, too, because of the variants. </p>
<p>It horrifies me to know that so many people will constantly throw away "just a few more weeks/months/years/decades" of their lives over the promise that maybe the last day will be 100 percent safe. </p>
<p>The crazy is real, and I experienced it firsthand.</p></p>

        <p>It's good to cut off people with no remorse, not so good to cut off your own ability to forgive.</p>
<p>Try to remember - they are victims here too. Their Government and Scientists and Healthcare Professionals and Teachers and Media put them through the biggest mind fuck of all history.</p>
<p>So if an apology comes around, and it is sincere, you should consider it.</p>

        <p>Without going into too much detail, I'll say that I felt scared of my dad. My username is based on a character, so while it says "mr", I'm actually a very small female. </p>
<p>I was placed with him after my mom died when I was 11, and he was abusive to me and extremely over protective when I was a pre/teen. </p>
<p>Why did I stay and help him and my step mom for years? I'm. I'm not even sure. It took a while to break his grasp around me for years, and I thought I would never feel helpless again until "leave and you kill the family" was the ammo.</p>

        <p>Sounds like he was using the virus as more of an excuse to control than probably fear. I doubt he was even that scared. I'm really glad you got out. And though it's not much consolation at least you have the experience to avoid the red flags your dad showed you.</p>

        <p>That is really scary and creepy. I'm glad you're finally able to move out. I wouldn't even step foot back in that household after that!</p>

        <p>Damn, good that you were able to separate yourself from that. It seems like most everyone was concerned in the beginning, as it started to become clear that it was so widespread. I still wash my hands regularly and try not to get too close to people aside from the time I have to for my career, but I'll admit I was cloroxing my groceries for a few months there. </p>
<p>Somewhere along the line it became clear that this is not about public health and is more about removing autonomy. I just can't trust that anything good will come of this.</p>

        <p>Man, you have to forgive me.   I simply don't want to believe this is true.   I don't want to live in that world. </p>
