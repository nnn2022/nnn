    <strong>Do you know how many people die from passive smoking alone? (+thoughts)</strong>
    <p><p>The general estimate is 1 in 100 deaths worldwide. <a href="https://ecancer.org/en/news/1393-600-000-deaths-per-year-caused-by-passive-smoking">1% of all deaths</a>.</p>
<p>We are witnessing a paradigm shift in society, and I dont like it. Death, and Life, is understood differently. I dont know why it was that way before, and why it is changing now. I obviously have by opinions.</p>
<p>To preface: Do I think governments should act to preserve the health of the people that endow it with the powers to govern? Yes.</p>
<p>Yes,  it should act in the best interest of the people. But the EXTENT of interference is up for debate - and I happen to believe that in the long run, implementing policies which make your health the responsability of other people around you will be detrimental to society. Maybe we should be  banning obesity - its been terrible on our collective healthcare taxes.  Mandatory excecise is the way to go, that way, you will be fitter and  less likely to be a disease vector. Also vitamin d supplements and flu  shots are mandatory now, smoking banned, and every sickness results in quarantine.  Socialising is important for your health, which means its important to  our health as a society, which again is why every houshold computer will temporarily shut off if its used more than 8h a day. Killing an  immunodefficient person trough a disease of yours they caught by sitting in the same doctors office is gonna earn you up to 10 years in prison,  and sex without an up-to-date STI- pass will be made illegal.</p>
<p><strong>My POINT: Thats never how we have done ANY of this. This is without precedent. Maybe for good reason.</strong></p>
<p>I think the New Normal is Ideological. I think the reason the new normal is being implemented across the western world today is that it wouldn't have worked before. And not just for technological reasons. I couldn't even begin to describe what is different from now to then, but I compare the results, and I decree the new way of life lacking.</p>
<p>Finally, asking questions like: "Do you think governments should be allowed to curtail the rights of those who infringe on the safety and well-being of others?" are putting a false dichotomy in the debate, which shills like to do with nuanced subjects.</p>
<p>The safety and well-being of a person in regards to health can only effectively be taken by that same person.  Anything else leads to tyranny. The farther you go into  controlling the populations actions, the greater gouvernment control  needs to be. Lets take that thought experiment further. While we are at it (because we cant possibly micromanage  all of that without the help of some AI or other), we could incentivize  people to report each other, maybe give them a fraction of the fine! So  that people stay motivated, we could also create a point system for all  actions that help society, and taking good care of yourself and  avoiding putting others at risk will give you privileges, like free  public transport, and not doing so will give you penalties, like  restricted access to certain spaces. Sounds good on its face, doesnt it?  Utopian, even.</p>
<p>What I am saying, essentially, is that I dont want to live in a society where the ideological new normal is commonplace.</p></p>

        <p>Life and death are treated differently because of lack of religion. With religion people do not fear death to the same extent. ‚ÄúSee you in the next life.‚Äù Destroy religion and you will just find a bunch of people who want to live forever, and you may find those that will do so at any cost, sensible or not. A lot of this younger generation think they do not need religion, but as I age and though I haven‚Äôt been a super religious person through my life, I am quickly realizing that they are dead wrong.</p>

        <p>My exact thoughts. People need something to believe in as a way to explain what they don't understand, and right now that's science. They worship Fauci, George Floyd, the vaccines, and the masks. They look at all the ridiculous hygiene theater the way religious people regard taking communion or fasting. That's why they're so neurotic about these things, because they genuinely believe their souls are on the line.</p>

        <p>This doesnt happen by chance.</p>
<p>There is a global agenda within the "Healthsector". Call it Global-Health 4.0 if you like.</p>
<p>One of the core aspects of the agenda (which was meant to be hollistic, but somehow ended up just caring about infectious diseases and digitalization) is a shifting baseline. A very dramatic one:</p>
<p>We went <strong>from responsive care to preventive care</strong>.</p>
<p>Doesnt sound to bad, but combined with the idea of globally spreading diseases and the technology to monitor more its pretty much a brave new world they envision.</p>
