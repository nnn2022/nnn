    <strong>Comparing the Flu vaccine to the COVID vaccine effectiveness and...</strong>
    <p><p>When looking up the Flu vaccine effectiveness, this is what is given:</p>
<p>21 CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the current influenza vaccine has been 45% effective overall against 2019-2020 seasonal influenza A and B viruses. <strong>Specifically, the flu vaccine has been 50% effective against influenza B/Victoria viruses and 37% effective against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.</strong></p>
<p>So the Flu vaccine's percentage is MUCH lesser compared to what they say about the covid vaccine.</p>
<p>Now, if we look at the COVID "vaccine", specifically Pfizer's/Moderna's, they usually are around the range of 80-90% or more, so knowing this, are the doomers secretly anti-vaxxers and don't believe their own hyped vaccine works? Because that's how they act like, begging for more restrictions anyway. LMAO where is their logic?</p>
<p><strong>Assuming nothing bad happens to the vaccinated, because these are very new drugs so it can go either way, then this is a fucking medical miracle yet doomers themselves act like its not enough! Its literally 40 to 50% MORE effective then even the Flu vaccine that has been around WAY longer. So who's really the anti-vaxxer here?</strong></p>
<p>NO vaccine is 100% effective, yet covid is held to a different standard and it has to be 100% and even 94% isn't enough??</p>
<p>"Yes its not 100% effective, and that's why we have to stay in lockdown for eternity and never return to normal"</p>
<p>â€” A lot of "people" (could be bots too)</p>

        <p>Correct, the only rational reason to want so many people inoculated, is that they don't think the vaccines are effective. </p>
<p>I foolishly believed the "my mask protects you, your mask protects me" mantra. </p>
<p>I will never be persuaded to believe "my vaccine protects you, your vaccine protects me" </p>
<p>Its honestly insulting.</p>

        <p>&rt; is that they don't think the vaccines are effective. </p>
<p>Lmao yeah this is why I love saying "who's the anti-vaxxer now?"</p>
<p>Because from their point of view, if they "fucking love science", well the COVID vaccine is literally a miracle to be around 80-90% effective. Not even the flu vaccine is that much (only around 30-50%), which has been around much longer. </p>
<p>Makes you wonder if, perhaps subconsciously, they don't believe their own bullshit and know something is wrong.</p>
