    <strong>There is clearly a plan and actions taken along to correct the problems (i.e. immunity). But what's the objective and what's next?</strong>
    <p><p>My view on their plan so far:</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>•   Develop mildly deadly virus / vaccine.</p>
<p>•   Release a virus in China.</p>
<p>•   Pay media for hysteria and fear.</p>
<p>•   Lack of immunity causes people start dying on streets.</p>
<p>•   Unexpectedly, people begin to develop immunity much faster than anticipated.</p>
<p>•   Cannot give up on plan. Forge false positives.</p>
<p>•   Increase deaths by sending sick people to nursing homes.</p>
<p>•   2 weeks / 4 weeks to flatten the curve. Need to gain time to developed new strains.</p>
<p>•   Start developing new stronger strains.</p>
<p>•   People might begin to forget virus. Force mandatory masks.</p>
<p>•   Enforce lockdowns.</p>
<p>•   Deadlier strains are taking longer than expected to develop. Censor anything that does not go with narrative.</p>
<p>•   Have some fun while waiting for new strain. Double mask. Triple mask. Anal swabs.</p>
<p>•   Start administering vaccines.</p>
<p>•   Release new strains in Africa. No results, no media coverage, population is already on HCQ.</p>
<p>•   Release newly developed variants in Brazil and other countries. Good results.</p>
<p>•   People continue to develop immunity without any need for vaccines <strong>&lt;- We are here</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>What can you think of next?</p></p>
