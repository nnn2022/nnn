    <strong>Once upon a time in China ... A short pandemic summary (part 1)</strong>
    <p><p>I wrote this almost one year ago, when the "pandemic" exploded in Italy, as a memory lets say, to never forget how things started and how even after 1 year, all those things that happened back then still make no sense."short .. summary" because this is indeed short compared to the huge amount of information it was compiled from.This first part will follow the China - Japan - Italy triangle, the start of so called pandemic. In the following parts ill try to talk about the science involved into this, the murderous pandemic protocols, vaccines, institutionalised genocide, governments and reasons for wich they would do such a thing. It`s a pretty long read so buckle up.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This is not a 5G, nanobots, aliens, bioweapons story, sorry to disapoint you if you are into that.(i could explain you why those will not be included tho, if you ask).All the following informations are taken and stitched from local newspapers in China / Japan (using translate) at the current happening time of the events.I did not add nor substract any information.I avoided international media sources, as they have proven multiple times in the past year that they bend for the highest bidder (Chinese droping dead from the virus, Italy coffins pictures from 10 years ago, and curently, India`s lack of oxygen story (a real crysis that it`s long known about, unrelated to Covid19)  + videos and pictures used by media in their articles and proven to be old incidents that took place in India. I am not a "specialist", scientist, doctor, teacher or any other important figure that controls your life, not even a college graduate (got in at medicine .. then i realised half year later that i cannot afford living expenses ... never gonna be a 'specialist' .. sad face), so all the opinions added to the actual facts, are to be seen as opinions, as i encourage you to filter them trough your own mind before sharing them with others, if you consider doing such a thing.Some informations might have changed in the past year.Also not a native english speaker, self-taught, so my grammar is pretty unstable and tends to explode from time to time from lack of practice, feel free to ask where you don`t understand.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>CHINA:</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 December 2019 -</strong> China`s first case of pneumonia with unknown etiology.Doctor Zhizhi Jiang, 51 yrs old, deputy chief physician of surgery at Dongguan Nancheng Hospital.In june 2019, he was diagnosed with allergic purpura (Henoch-Schonlein purpura or HSP), a form of vasculitis with unclear origins believed to be an innapropiate immune system response to an upper respiratory infection, chickenpox, strep throat, measles, hepatitis, certain medications, food, insect bites and exposure to cold weather, and many other things. After trying hormone medication with no positive effect, dr. Zhizhi Jiang started taking immunosuppresants that weakened his immunity, leading to severe lungs infections (confirmed by sputum and blood culture) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (a known nosocomial agent, present in all hospitals around the world, for beeing a major cause of pneumonia). On Decembers 4th his situation is getting worse and he is beeing transfered to Guangzhou institute of respiratory diseases in ICU, where they confirm his diagnosis of pneumonia and fungi.On 31 December, his condition is still not ok so he is moved to an isolation ward.On January 1st he recieves a visit by professor Liu Xiaoqing, one of the leading experts in respiratory diseases that suggests using polymyxin and german immunoglobulin as soon as possible.No other info since then.Sources indicate that he was positive to COVID19 on 14th January, just few days after the tests for this were developed.This is believed to be a candidate for patient 0 according to media. His case was used in chinese media to draw atention and sugest that a deadly virus is on the loose. Weird enough tho .. he was doing just fine months after he was suposedly infected with something.No further info on him was available after that.</p>
<p><strong>10 december 2019</strong> - Another one to be considered patient 0 is a Woman named Wei Guixian, 58 yrs old, working at the wet market in Wuhan, that starts feeling sick`lish with flu like symptoms.Between 11 and 24 Dec, she visited multiple clincs and hospitals where she recieved multiple various treatments.Her state was getting worse and worse after each taken treatment.By 24 Dec she was barely conscious and was admited to hospital.She was "cured" in 7 days, beeing released on 1-3 January, with 0 COVID19 treatment since the new virus fragment is to be found on January 3rd.She points out that the infection might have come from the public toilets in the market, used by everyone. So yet again, we have a 'deadly virus' without victims.</p>
<p><strong>12 december 2019</strong> - Chinese propaganda machine starts pumping fear into population, when CCTV also known as "mouthpiece of Chinese government" reports that a new deadly disease engulfs Wuhan, tho at that point, there were 0 victims, 0 cases of COVID19, and just 2 cases presumed to have an unknown disease.Also, taxi drivers were informing clients that there is a deadly virus running wild .. no further comments on this. Many of you might not be familiar with a used chinese torture tehnique, named "chinese water drop" (hope i got the name right), in wich the victim is imobilised on the ground, as they use a pierced vessel place above them to drip water on their forehead.This becomes unbearable after a time, driving them to madness and eventualy death.The same psychologic technique was used in the creation of pandemic, using fear instead of water.</p>
<p><strong>15 december 2019</strong> - 65 yrs old male, starts having a fever.After visiting a doctor on 18 december, his condition gets worse and he`s hospitalised on 22 with community-aquired pneumonia.On 24 december, samples of his alveolar lavage fluid is beeing sent to Guangzhou Weiyuan Gene Technology Co. that never reports back the results, just saying over the phone that it might be a new coronavirus.On February 21, the genetic informations regarding this patient, are beeing posted on WeChat (chinese social media platform) by an account aparently belonging to Weiyuan Gene.Also, another message on WeChat, from a person named "Small Dog", states that he works in a private company located in the same area as Weiyuan Gene, and recieved on 26 december a sample taken from a patient on 24 december.</p>
<p><strong>18-29 December 2019</strong> - 7 patients hospitalized with severe pneumonia (not mentioned if its of uknwnon cause) are hospitalized at the Wuhan Yin-Tan hospital.Scientists take samples of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, that was later used for genome sequencing of Sars-Cov2.Tests performed on the samples showed a similarity of 94.5 % with SARS.Further analysis was performed, ending up with 81-87 % similarity to SARS.BAL is not a standardized procedure, and contamination cannot be totaly excluded.</p>
<p><strong>25 December 2019</strong> - Rumors start to spread in hospitals: Lu Xiaohong, director of gastroenterology in Wuhan Fifth hospital says that she might`ve heard that some staff members might be infected.Zhang Jixian, director of respiratory and critical care at Hubei provincial hospital, thinks that he has two patients with what he believes to be an infectious disease.Hubei provincial hospital says they might have three related cases also, but they are not sure</p>
<p><strong>30 December 2019</strong> - Now this here .. is the mother of all things to follow.. making Sars-Cov2 the first "virus" to be discovered on a social network .. CapitalBio Medlab of Beijing reports that a genetic sequence taken from one patient beeing hospit with SARS, is not correct.The report is beeing posted on WeChat (intentionally or not) from where is beeing taken by alot of doctors that do not have any kind of virusology expertise, like doctor Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, that shares it with his students, and so on, thus spreading missinformation on social media and leading to more panic.Same day, a famous police officer in Nanjing, mentioned the BSL-4 laboratory of Wuhan telling peoples not to worry because they can handle this if its true.Once again, media distorts his words, and turn it into an "escaped virus scenario".</p>
<p>Current edit: Up to this day, i did not hear anything about this person that 'discovered' the new virus fragment. Where is he ? Shouldnt we give him a nobel prize ? Don`t know how many of you knew, but there was a money prize offered to whomever comes up with the complete virus sample.The term expired in december 2020, no one showed up .. Also, China up to date, never provided a complete isolated viral genome to any country .. it`s all theoretical.</p>
<p><strong>31 December 2019</strong> - Once again, CCTV comes out and issues an epidemiological alert, telling the entire country that an uknown deadly virus has been found.This is also based on pure speculations and baseless rumors, since by this time there still is no oficial report to say that this virus actually exists, and also 0 deaths.They are beeing atacked by The People`s Daily, saying that its premature to speculate such things</p>
<p><strong>January 3 2020</strong> - Chinese scientists at the National Institute of Viral Disease Comitee (IVDC) rule out the possibilities of 26 common respiratory pathogens.They practicaly rallied up everyone that worked in the Wuhan fish market, showing fever-pneumonia-cough and so on, and tested them for all respiratory known diseases, except coronaviruses, as the article mentions.Only after they recieved the partial sequence, they used it to confirm on January 7 that it was the pathogenic cause of this cluster of patients. Same day, the same IVDC scientists publish an article saying that they got the first complete genome (computer generated) of the novel coronavirus Sars-cov2 that was indentified in the samples of BALF taken from 1 patient in Wuhan.The genome is 87.99 % identical to  bat SARS-like.They also mention that three distinct strains have been identified.(guessing that they found all 3 of them in the same pacient ? since nothing else is mentioned about this)</p>
<p><strong>January 5 2020</strong> - One curious statement comes from russian prof. Mikhail Shchelkanov, head of laboratory of virology in the FSC of biodiversity, among many other things, saying that "they"(as in they, the scientists) knew about this new virus sequence before the chinese made it public on 5 january (statement made on 17 march 2020)</p>
<p><strong>January 7 2020</strong> - CCP comitee has a meeting, in wich president Xi Jinping demands the prevention and control of the epidemic (in short, the whole pack of shocking pandemic measures that took place in China).At this moment,  still 0 deaths, and just couple dozen of cases presumed to have a deadly disease that`s not killing them.All these pandemic protocols, allows them to take whatever freedom peoples had left, thats why we`ve seen peoples locked inside their homes and left to die from hunger and other such things.This also fuels international media fear campaing with random videos of peoples droping dead on streets, bodies piling up and such (all of these were possible because of the protocols because there wasnt at any given moment a surge of bodies piling up at the morgue.The protocols state that the bodies, no matter the real cause of death, if they are to be found with COVID19 also, are to be baged and taken away from the hospitals as soon as possible to prevent further infection.This inevitably leads to overcrowding  the incinerators, thus those news about "to many bodies for incinerators bla bla"</p>
<p><strong>January 9</strong> - W.H.O posts its first risk assessment, reporting that the Chinese authorities had acted switftly, having a total of 41 infected at this point.</p>
<p><strong>January 10</strong> -  Sars-cov2 sequencing data is made public worldwide, in order to create adequate tests for it, by researchers from Fudan University, Shanghai.A further 3 sequences come from the Chinese CDC, one more from Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and one from Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan. Same day, Li Wenliang, the chinese ophthalmologist and coronavirus whistleblower starts having symptoms of a dry cough.He "tries" the new tests, results beeing negative multiple times untill 30 January (20 days later), dying 6 days after that.You could say that this man was tested to death.. until the tests came positive.</p>
<p><strong>11 January 2020</strong> - China reports its first COVID19 death, man 61 yrs old, that died on January 9, suffering from multiple abdominal tumors and chronic liver disease (diseases that are minutes or few days away from beeing fatal). This raises alot of questions, as how this man did not die from previous health issues, but from COVID19.Authorities reported that treatment did not improve his respiratory symptoms, so they had to put him on ventilation.They stated that his immediate cause of death was COVID19 and not his multiple health problems.. </p>
<p>Curent edit: You`re reading this i hope .. so this person .. could`ve lived MANY more years if not Covid19 according to authorities.</p>
<p><strong>15 January 2020</strong> - 2nd death reported.Man, 69 years old, hospitalised with severe myocarditis (another disease caused by a multitude of viruses, knowing to spread through contact with body fluids) and he was also experiencing severe damage to multiple organs.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>This same scenario repeats in every other country. Peoples with terrible co-morbs, that could die at any moment, from theyr pre-existent co-morbs, are flipped into Covid19 patients, "specialists" telling you that "they could have lived longer". True .. but also they could`ve died in the next 5 minutes without any other external influence like Sars-Cov2. A thing that was also rarely discussed.In a separate study i did, wich contains details of 1026 deaths marked as Covid19, 95 % of them are peoples with terminal cancers (not the kind that you can treat or in the begining stages), kidney problems (also a deadly thing), diabetes (this here is a whole subject, as it`s a real death cause more than you realise, ill develop the subject in another article), and hey ... 2-3 peoples that died in a fire, 1-2 suicides, couple of failed surgeries and so on (because why not ? it`s all Covid19 now baby). Events in China become less of interest after this date, as the scenario repeats, so ill move to Japan.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>JAPAN:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In order to see the big picture and how this would be impossible in a real pandemic scenario, lets see some Japan facts first:</p>
<p>- Japan has a pop of 126 mil compared to 328 mil pop in USA, that would be about 1/3 BUT on a surface 26 times smaller than USA. This facilitates the spread of virus like nowhere else around the world.. well ok .. maybe just India in some areas.Tokyo-Kanto area is one of the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with 37 mil pop. Thats three times more peoples than Wuhan, followed by Yokohama city with almost 4 mil and Osaka city with almost 3 mil.</p>
<p>- Tokyo subway is actualy in World Records book as one of the most crowded places in the world. with 3.1 bilions riders per year, Shinjuku station seeing 3.6 milion peoples each day.Imagine a COVID19 infected patient sneezing just two times while taking the morning subway here.. you get between 28 and 56 new infected just by directly inhaling the droplets + thousand more from touching the surfaces on wich the droplets landed.In just one day you would have maybe 30-40 % of Tokyo infected, and 10-20 % of Kanto area ? Crazy huh ? </p>
<p>- Another world record from Japan, is the Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo.Almost 3.000 peoples cross it at once, every 2 minutes.Sometimes it gets so crowded that you can feel their infected COVID19 sweat dripping on you while waiting to cross.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>16 January 2020</strong> - Japan announces its first case. A man in his 30`s, living in Kanto region, returned from Wuhan on 6th after developing a fever on 3rd, hospitalized between 10 and 15th, beeing released because he was cured.Authorities declared that he spent time with his family for 4 days before beeing hospitalized, but they dont have the virus.Also, the man did not test positive to airport checks, having no fever.</p>
<p><strong>28 January 2020 -</strong> Japan finds its first community transmited case, with a total of 7 cases.A tour bus driver, 60 yrs old, that was transporting chinese tourist groups between Tokyo and Osaka, between 8 - 16 January.The man was hospitalized with pneumonia as symptoms, and he was also cured.We can speculate that by now we would also have communitary transmition in Tokyo and Osaka.</p>
<p><strong>3 February 2020 -</strong>  Japan has 13 confirmed cases, and decides to ban everyone thats arriving from Hubei Provice in China</p>
<p><strong>13 February 2020</strong> - Japan record its first death. Woman, 80 yrs old, her son is a taxi driver in Tokyo, confirmed also as beeing positive to COVID19.She was allready hospitalized with pneumonia since 1 February, CV19 to be tested <strong>after she died</strong>.Authorities declared that they are not sure if CV19 was the cause of death.No other reports up to this date and also no info to the co-morbidities she had.So the China "deadly virus" scenario takes place here also, peoples that are dying from the usual health problems and nothing new.</p>
<p><strong>27 February 2020</strong> - PM Shinzo Abe requests all schools to be closed.The effect has the oposite effect, since alot of high schoolers are now out on the streets leading to even bigger crowds, as japanese news posts report.</p>
<p><strong>5 March 2020</strong> - Japan has a bit over 1000 infected and 6 deaths at this point, so they decide to take some quarantine measures against peoples that come from any China region and South Korea.At that time South Korea had 4000+ cases and China 80,552 infected. SO yes .. once again this makes no sense ..</p>
<p><strong>25 March 2020</strong> - Governor Yuriko Koike helds a press conference asking peoples to work from home if possible, and refrain from going out at night as much as possible. No one listens, streets beeing as crowded as usual.</p>
<p><strong>28 March 2020</strong> - PM Abe helds a press conference announcing that "huge, powerful" measures will include fiscal stimulus, monetary steps and tax breaks for companies.At that time, Japan had 1.500 cases and 52 deaths.After Abe`s economic measures announcement, the cases started to spike out of nowhere from 3 % to 13 % in a matter of hours indicating that "the more CV19 cases you as a country have, the more money you get"</p>
<p><strong>31 March 2020</strong> - Abe is starting to recieve calls from "medical experts", governors and other countries asking him to declare state of emergency because it makes them look bad.Same day the numbers spike again from 4.7 % to 11.5 % to be presented as proof that it`s bad. The numbers return to normal tho after couple more days.</p>
<p><strong>6 April 2020</strong> - Abe declares state of emergency, initially aimed at cities like Tokyo and Osaka.Japan has 3.600 cases and 85 deaths at this point.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Conclusion about Japan following the events mentioned above: After two months of pandemic, with community transmission, no lockdowns, a very small percent of them wearing masks, no social distancing,nothing closed except schools, increased susceptibility to the virus because the "specialists" said ACE receptors and asians form a couple bla bla, Japan had no dead bodies piling up on streets as it was advertised by China, no crowded hospital, no spike in deaths (85 total deaths presumed to be Covid but then again not proved by authorities), nothing ! Things changed only after the olympics were postponed and they`ve started to recieve calls from other countries.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>ITALY:</strong></p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>While Japan was raising more and more question marks, W.H.O was ready to move at the next phase. Italy is 2nd country in the world after Japan with the oldest population, so it`s normal to have a high number of deaths in the older pop, all you needed were tests to say its Covid19.Having everyone`s atention on China, W.H.O had plenty of time to suply tests and train staff on how to misuse RT-PCR testing in Italy.Remember how their cases boomed over night once they started testing. No testing = no pandemic (and i must say that this is actually extremly manipulative, because it can be true in some cases, but not this one.If a pandemic involving a deadly virus is here, you don`t need tests to see it`s effects).Testing = every usual death becomes Covid19.To be noticed, that once Italy cases went crazy, W.H.O declared it`s a pandemic, and China was pulled out, their cases going to almost 0, as they were not needed anymore. (China thanks to the pandemic, is about to become number one by the end of this year, to be later discussed)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Having Italy as the main pawn, W.H.O can implement the pandemic protocols to all countries thanks to that.These protocols should`ve been questioned from the start because .. once again .. something was not ok with them. The protocols stated that, if a city has let`s say 5 hospitals, 2 of them are to be closed and transformed into Covid19 hospitals, while the normal patients are redirected to the other 3. What happens here is that, alot of patients that need healthcare (not urgent) were denied and sent home while the Covid19 hospitals are empty for months (thats why nurses were dancing and doing nothing in clips).Theyr health state gets worse, and they return in an agravated state, test positive, and die to be later tagged as a Covid19 victim. Not sure if im explaining this in the best way.Let`s say that you have diabetes, your acces to normal healthcare and medicine is strangled by the Covid19 crisis, your situation gets worse, you go to the hospital where is also a big chance to be found out as Covid19 positive, the doctors (and this is insanely real) ignore your diabetes crysis and treat you for Covid, you die (diabetes is passed as a co-morb and Covid19 as main cause) so you just became a Covid19 statistic.The pandemic protocols designed by W.H.O, turns the health system into a Covid19 machine, in wich are caught not just those that inevitably were about to die from cancers and such, but also peoples that could`ve been saved and have a normal life.Take intubation for example, that was imposed for covid19 patients.An intubated healthy person, has a very high chance to die.Now imagine if you do that to someone that has other health problems also... </p>
<p>So now in Italy we have, the usual deaths + sick peoples that die from beeing caught in the Covid19 protocols and beeing denied normal healthcare + those absurd  cases like car accidents and even someone ran over by a train (not sure if this was a fake news), all to be taged as Covid19 deaths to fuel the pandemic and scare everyone.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The newest pawn in their game is India, where we can see the China - Italy scenario repeating, based on peoples lack of knowledge.What you see now in the news about India is nothing more than, manipulated news using old pictured and videos from past years incidents that took place (to a certain degree of course)  + theyr awfull health system (good thing they have a space program) + traditions (peoples are burning theyr dead since forever) + those colapsed peoples on the streets (it`s more common that you can imagine to see peoples taking a nap like that) + hunger amplified by past year`s pandemic protocols + heat waves + oxygen suply problems (but wait, this was a problem for a long time there, so yet again .. nothing new) + vaccines (again, to some degree, i cannot vouch for this, just a thought as they had a great vaccination rate)</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Seeing as things went since then to where we are now .. it should really make you wonder if the vaccines were made for the pandemic .. or the pandemic was fabricated to make you accept them, while giving up on all your liberties in the process.</p></p>

        <p>It does indeed. I took a break since last summer, keeping myself away from any pandemic info, just to come back and find myself into a vaccine hell.</p>
<p>The peoples behind this .. not sure how to describe them. I think "Japan unit 731" would be best example. They are on the same level and worse.They see us as logs, not as human beeings, and sadly, some of them will get away with it, because no one will ever know for sure all the figures behind it, we can just guess.</p>
