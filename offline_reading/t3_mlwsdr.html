    <strong>Lockdowns took everything from me</strong>
    <p><p>Fucking Germany. No end-of-school trip, no prom, no parties. Only morons who yell at me when I am standing to close to them. This whole thing is though as fuck without any real friends or a partner. I am wasting my fucking time, felt so nice spending your last years of your teenager life sitting at home. I can't even go to the gym or do something else to pass the time, still have to pay for the gym. </p>
<p>Now there is gonna be yet another national lockdown due 8000 cases per day 🤡.</p></p>

        <p>Same. I’m in the UK. I messed school up badly so I had to re-take all my studies and finally got into university. When I joined in September 2019, I had finally made friends, Id joined a dance society and my chronic depression was finally becoming manageable, after years. Fast forward to now, I’ve got overweight and I can’t leave the house without severe anxiety, to the point of where all my hands and jaw seized-up last week, out of the blue. This lockdown has taken me several steps back, in every sense. I feel all your frustrations.
The problem is with the UK is that they pretend they have this fighting spirit, left over from WWII, but all those ppl are long dead. We are nothing but a nation of cowards.</p>

        <p>The people on reddit are not representative for the actual population. Most people here I talk to in real life have a pretty good idea about what actually is happening. And most of those that have not are open to debate.</p>
<p>About being smarter than US-Citizens: I dont think one could say we are smarter in all fields. We might me better educated overall and maybe know a little more on average, thanks to your abysmal education system, but I am actually very impressed with the american mindset of "freedom". There is no similar thing existing here in germany and I had to learn to "think freely" from seeing how you americans think. This is one of the very few things I deem a benefit of social media. But to be fair, I often wish I did not do this. Life would be easier believing all the Covid lies the government serves us and believing that being locked away in isolation is actually the best thing that could ever happen to me. Blissful ignorance.</p>

        <p>I spent 10 years on a plan to make something of myself. I went to the military, went to college, got a good degree and finally was able to move to New York and a nice part of New York at that. My social circle was getting established, I was dating a lot and I met a very attractive and smart girl. That all got taken away. New York is a dystopian shithole city filled with brainless NPCs. None of the things I moved here to do I can do and my 20s ended in cold bitter loneliness. All because of a virus with 99% survival rate</p>

        <p>If you’re a real cynic you’re going to come to the conclusion that we only have these lockdowns in order to keep a big part of the voting base of our two “Volksparteien” alive. A quarter of all SPD Voters are seniors and around 16% of Union voters are seniors, the margin is higher for the CSU in Bavaria. The Union margin rises even higher if you include people close to the retirement age. If all these voters would die or be compelled to vote for someone else due to too lax regulations. Both parties together wouldn’t be able to form another majority government. But I’m not even sure who would want another one of those. And the other parties follow a similar rhetoric because it has been ingrained into us. If 5 minutes of the 15 minutes Tagesschau is filled with Covid, it is no surprise everyone seems so obsessed.

        <p>leider lebt das imperium noch immer ...</p>
<p>leider ist es noch heute im jahr 2021 die traurige realitaet dass sich ein grossteil der menschen von einer kleinen minderheit beluegen laesst</p>
<p>sich befehlen laesst, wann sie wie lange vor die tuere gehen duerfen</p>
<p>sich befehlen laesst, sich selbst die freie luftzufuhr zu blockieren</p>
<p>sich befehlen laesst, die naehe zu anderen menschen zu vermeiden</p>
<p>heute ist es nicht mehr gott oder die "heilige mutter kirche", auch ist es weder eine der verbliebenen galionsfiguren der feudalen familien welche es geschafft haben, dass sich die mehrheit der menschen in ein umfassendes mehrjaehriges ... angst vor einem virus ... diktatur programm einbinden laesst</p>
<p>nein es ist die verbindung geschickte verknuepfung von ... willst du anteil nehmen am oeffentlichen leben, dann fuege dich den masken-,soziale distanz-,desinfizierungs idiotien .... willst du gesellschaftlich mitreden koennen, mach den fehler und erklaere den coronavirus zu deinem feind ... zeige deine loyalitaet zur virus-bekaempfungs-maschinerie indem du deine kontaktdaten angibst wenn immer moeglich so dass du kontaktverfolgt werden kannst und zwangsisoliert, in selbstquarantaene geschickt werden kannst</p>
<p>dies also der eine teil ... das soziale einander in dieses krankhafte virus-bekaempfen-solidarisches-sich-selbst-beschraenken zu pushen ... hineinzudruecken</p>
<p>aber der wirklich deftig heftig wirksame groessere teil was den weitreichenden einschraenkungen der bewegungs- wie auch  der versammlungsfreiheit in 2020 und 2021 die befolgung erlaubt ...</p>
<p>ist die unsicherheit, das eigene nicht-vertrauen von ganz vielen menschen</p>
<p>bin ich genug stark, um mich der wahrheit der natur zu stellen ...</p>
<p>bin ich bereit genau hinzuhoeren was mein koerper mir sagen wuerde wenn ich den coronavirus in mir aufnehmen wuerde als lehrer als Botschafter der natur welche zu mir kommt um mir zu zeigen ... hey, hier ist noch ein haufen muell, den hast du vergessen aufzuräumen, diese ablagerungen in diesem organ, in diesem gelenk ... und hier auch noch ist etwas das blockiert, was verstopft, was dir erschwert das chi die lebensenergie durch dich hindurchfliessen zu lassen</p>
<p>wie kann ich dies nun umdrehen ins positive</p>
<p>also ... das imperium wird sterben ... es ist nur noch eine frage der zeit</p>
<p>es kann einen monat gehen, ein jahr, zehn jahre oder auch ... ich hoffe es wirklich nicht ... noch hundert jahre</p>
<p>bis die mehrheit der menschen es merkt, dass die menschen die von ihnen gehorsam verlangen, unterwuerfigkeit... dass ihre sogenannten anfuehrenden personen ... ihnen nichts gutes tun indem sie ihnen befehlen wann sie zu laufen, gehen, stehen und zu sitzen haetten ... wann sie erlaubt waeren wie zu atmen</p>
<p>( also ich habe wirklich noch immer muehe damit dies wirklich zu glauben ... ich lebe in einer welt ... wo menschen anderen menschen die erlaubnis geben, ihnen zu befehlen, dass sie sich die luftzufuhr erschweren sollten ... )</p>
<p>und nur fuer den fall dass es bald soweit sein sollte ... koennte ja schon morgen oder uebermorgen oder am naechsten mittwoch soweit sein ... wer weiss wann die menschen genug haben von sich zuhause einsperren zu lassen</p>

        <p>ich wuesste da einen weg ... oder ich glaube zumindest dass dieser weg eine moeglichkeit waere... das imperium zu toeten ... alle hierarchien abzuschaffen, sie aufzuloesen</p>
<p>und der waere:</p>
<p>die staatsverfassung zu erneuern</p>
<p>die grundlage des staatswesens, das dokument welches die grundlage eines staates bildet, die staatsverfassung zu erneuern im sinne von:</p>
<p>---<br>
jede einwohnergemeinde ist sich ihr eigener absoluter souveraen.<br>
sie erhaelt/erbt alle politische kraft von kanton und eidgenossenschaft.<br>
die souveraene einwohnergemeinde schafft, unterhaelt und legt es aus, das oertlich gueltige gesetz, was die einwohnenden menschen in dieser einwohnergemeinde miteinander und fuereinander gestalten. regeln welche auf dem boden der souveraenen gemeinde gueltig sind.  </p>
<p>alle souveraenen einwohnergemeinden erben/erhalten einen nach der anzahl der einwohnenden menschen berechneten anteil am materiellen und finanziellen vermoegen von kanton wie eidgenossenschaft.  </p>
<p>jede souveraene  einwohnergemeinde kann jederzeit ohne bedingungen aus kanton wie eidgenossenschaft austreten.  </p>
<p>----</p>
<p>eine solche dezentralisierung der politischen entscheidungskraefte auf die ebene der oertlichen gemeinschaft der menschen die einander nachbarn sind, die in naechster naehe zu einander leben, nebeneinander  </p>
<p>scheint mir ein super direkter weg zu sein ... die ganze pyramidenstruktur welche ein imperium braucht um zu funktionieren ... super elegant aufzuloesen... mit einer abstimmung, einer schriftlichen volksbefragung zu einer solchen verfassungserneuerung</p>
<p>das imperium kann nur dort funktionieren ... wo einige wenige ganz viele mehr davon ueberzeugt haben, dass die ganz vielen ohne die vorherrschaft der einigen wenigen nicht funktionieren koennen</p>

        <p>also so in etwa wie ... achtung jetzt kommt ein sarkastisches monsterbild ...</p>
<p>ich bin so dankbar dass die sich per notrecht zu diktatoren selbst erhobenen befehlsgeber  mir die anweisung gegeben haben, mir selbst die luftzufuhr zu blockieren</p>
<p>in meiner unenendlichen hilfslosigkeit und dummheit bin ich nicht imstande die luft ohne eine blockade zu verarbeiten</p>
<p>mmmmh... uuu das war jetzt etwas ganz verdreht abartiges, geht mir grad schlechter nachdem ich sowas geschrieben habe .... waeh .... ekelt mich an dass ich sowas tue</p>
<p>wie kann ich es wieder gut machen ... ah ja ich weiss ... indem ich ein freudiges bild zeichne</p>
<p>von der zeit die kommen wird, so hoffe ich ... wenn wir es denn wollen dass diese zeit kaeme</p>
<p>wir sind ja etwa 8 milliarden menschen</p>
<p>und ich denke schon dass es eine mehrheit braucht welche genug haben davon befehlsempfaenger zu sein, genug haben die last der pyramide zu tragen</p>
<p>also ... ich sehe die moeglichkeit, dass durch die annahme einer erneuerten staatsverfassung im oben beschrieben sinne ..</p>
<p>die einwohnergemeinde ist sich ihr eigener absoluter souveraen. die menschen welche in der einwohnergmeinde ihren festen hauptwohnsitz haben, gestalten miteinander fuereinander zusammen in einstimmigkeit oder vielleicht auch nur in einem qualifizierten mehr von 60 prozent was hier und jetzt das recht sei, was hier und jetzt gesetz sei an diesem ort, in dieser einwohnergemeinde.</p>
<p>dass wir auf diesem wege zur wahrheit kommen koennten ... zur gelebten wahrheit</p>
<p>was stimmt hier und jetzt fuer alle von uns</p>
<p>in diesem kreis der nachbarn</p>
<p>eine besonders schoene Idee finde ich in der (voll)Versammlung aller kinder, jugendlichen und erwachsenen menschen die hier und jetzt in dieser einwohnergemeinde ihren festen hauptwohnsitz haben</p>
<p>alle menschen allen alters und jeglichen geburtsortes wuerden einander die genau gleich gewichtete stimmkraft anerkennen ... alle menschen die hier nicht nur zu besuch sind oder auf der durchreise, sondern die sich fest hier niedergelassen haben an diesem ort ... waeren willkommen, sich einzugeben in alle entscheidungen welche getroffen wuerden was die gemeinde angeht</p>
<p>wir alle die hier und jetzt uns niedergelassen haben in dieser einwohnergemeinde wuerden das gesetz miteinander fuereinander gestalten und es auch auslegen ... das recht sprechen</p>
<p>wir wollten keinen richter, noch einen anwalt, noch einen anklaeger ... wir wollten keinen praesidenten noch einen polizisten oder soldaten ... weder einen gefaengnisswaerter noch einen steuereintreiber</p>
<p>sondern wir wollten ein gefuehl fuereinander entwickeln .... was stimmt fuer alle hier und jetzt ... was kann ich wie tun, wie kann ich wo sein um mich einzubringen oder fuer mich alleine zu sein so dass es dem ganzen gut tut... auf dass mein sein und tun mir wie allen anderen zur freude sei</p>
<p>ich glaube dass es moeglich sein koennte, auf ein moeglichst minimales oertliches gesetz zu kommen ... sich darauf zu einigen .. so in etwa wie</p>
<p>---<br>
wir ... alle menschen allen alters und jeglichen geburtsortes ... welche heute hier und jetzt in dieser einwohnergemeinde unseren festen hauptwohnsitz haben ... anerkennen die gemeinschaft, die ( voll ) versammlung aller kinder, jugendlichen und erwachsenen alle mit der genau gleich gewichteten stimmkraft als das gesetzgebende organ dieser sich selbst ihr eigener absoluter souveraen seiender einwohnergemeinde</p>
<p>wir streben danach, in den wirtschaftlichen/sozialen/intellektuellen etc. beziehungen zueinander ein hoechstmoegliches harmonisches einverstaendniss miteinander zu erreichen</p>
<p>um moeglichst wenig regeln und ein moeglichst einfaches gesetz <br>
zu erreichen</p>
<p>wo liebe fliesst braucht es keine regeln</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>also ich muss es trotzdem noch sagen .... so stark war der schaden soeben den ich mir zugefuegt haben in der obigen sarkastischen Verdrehung ... also hier die gute wahre direkte offene gesunde sache:</p>
<p>ich glaube dass in der luft die nachrichten von mutter erde, von vater sonne und unseren sternengeschwistern reisen</p>
<p>im atem verbinden wir uns mit allem was lebt auf dem planeten, in ihm</p>
<p>moege der tiefe friede der frei fliessenden luft mit uns sein</p>
<p>moegen wir allezeit in uns selbst vertrauen, in das urwissen was wir in unseren zellen tragen... auf dass alles was das netz des lebens uns schenkt wir annehmen duerfen in liebe und freude ... auf dass all unsere kleinsten mitlebewesen, die kleinsten kinder der schoepfung, die bakterien und viren unsere freunde und freundinnen sein moegen</p>
<p>es wird sein wenn wir es wollen</p>
<p>es ist weil wir es sind</p>

        <p>Why do you have to pay for the gym? </p>
<p>Try online gaming to make friends your own age?  If you like watching stuff various places to tewatch groups - text based like on reddit or live watch streaming things but i dont know their names. </p>
<p>My understanding that the sitting at home rate for young people was huge the last decade - more competition / pressure to comply with a bad education system and more time spent gaming and more time watching on demand streaming instead of going out because there is nothing on tv / bored. Young people have lots more at home environmental stimuli to choose from - porn availability and more time lying on beds with phones browsing / chatting ect. That at home thing is cultural / technological &amp; ageical not "corvidial"</p>
<p>8000 cases is allot - a lockdown will reduce travel and transmission which will reduce loads on heath services. I get that its annoying but here in Ireland we had the oposite problem- they lifted restrictions for new years and we had gotten to less than 10 cases a day (being an island and having months long restrictions) then shot up to to 1400 a day early January. 4 weeks later we had a peak of 70-94 deaths a day for a week all because we lifted restrictions. Our past 4 week case is still at 7400 and its fucking April. </p>
<p>If people had just complied in full and the shitty "essential business" shite actually enforced mask policy the numbers would be far lower.  </p>
<p>Everyones losing out. Its not just being Irish and loving paddys day but its always my favorite because because i usually quit drinking and smoking from Jan for 10 weeks until paddys day and its the first big piss up of the year - no paddys day for the 2nd year in a row but i strongly support restrictions because even though it sucks missing out -  objectively looking at the deaths / cost / suffering every time a lockdown is lifted its not worth it.</p>
