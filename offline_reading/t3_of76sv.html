    <strong>I saw the Cochon Danceur- Dancing Pig</strong>
    <p><p>I think this happened last year.</p>
<p>Ive heard a couple of people talk about seing pig like creatures standing upright and dancing. I saw something like this a while ago too. I think around this time last year, my family and I were having dinner outside on our picnic table. Granted it was dark out at the time- We eat dinner at the super late Spanish people hour for some reason- and I just noticed it across the street- I live right next to the local library, and in between me and the actual library building is a little parking lot and a kids playground. I saw the thing in the parking lot, dancing, right near a car, under a streetlight. It was far away, so I couldnt see exactly what it was, but I definitely saw something moving. I went over there but by the time I got there it was gone.</p>
<p>This seems like something people have seen for years. One of the oldest silent movies is a French movie called Le Cochon Danceur. A little girl dances with a bug anthropomorphic pig, feigning friendship, then makes fun of him in front of the other kids and kind of enslaves him. It ends with the two of them walking off the stage, then the pig walking back on, rubbing his belly, a lot bigger now, baiscally saying the pig ate her.</p>
<p>Ill mention theres a shitload of creepy unexplainable shit in my neighborhood. Theres a house there that until very recently neither I nor anyone els in my family noticed- My brother calls it the SEP house. A thing from Hitchikers Guid To The Galaxy. My cats have a whole host of unexplainable shit, most notably appearing in the house without us letting them in. And several of my friends have heard laughing kids at the playground... when they hang out there a midnight. </p>
<p>Anyone else see the dancing pigs?</p></p>
