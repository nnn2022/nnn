    <strong>We have a chance to stop the lockdowns -- go buy $GME and $AMC with WallStreetBets! Reunite our people! Smash the elite who did this to us!</strong>
    <p><p>For the uninitiated, /r/wallstreetbets has figured out a way to fuck over the elites that have been responsible for our financial suffering since 2008, and we as anti-lockdowners need to get in on it to help save some of the businesses that got fucked over heavily by the lockdowns, and put an end to the tyranny once and for all! I'll explain:</p>
<p>TL;DR /r/wallstreetbets figured out that big fat-cat hedge funds were shorting $GME, GameStop, and $AMC, AMC theaters -- the same movie theater company that almost went bankrupt as a direct result of the lockdowns. So, they decided to engage in some shenanigans: get everybody to buy up  and HOLD GameStop and AMC stock to raise the prices of those stocks so that the hedge-funds would have to re-buy them back at a loss, completely fucking them over.</p>
<p>The big hedge funds have already lost $70 billion dollars.</p>
<p>Some of the brokerages that those hedge funds own a big part of, like Robinhood, Webull, and the like have been stopping regular people from buying GameStop and AMC stock, and even forced people to sell their stocks without their permission and against their will! Robinhood is getting smacked with a class action lawsuit over it!</p>
<p>Everyone in the world is uniting to buy the shit out of these stocks, and to HOLD them, never selling them for any reason, specifically to keep the prices up long enough that the major hedge funds can go bankrupt, and the people can sell them to recoup the money that was stolen from them in 2008. Stolen from them in the 2010's. Stolen from them in 2020 when big business colluded with government to forcibly shut down <em>all of their competitions and to completely destroy the entertainment and restaurant industry.</em></p>
<p>The same hedge funds who were some of the major players who, in the beginning of last year, <strong>purposefully shorted stocks before the public was alerted to the coronavirus.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The same scumbags who made off with</strong> <strong><em>a trillion dollars!</em></strong></p>
<p>The effort is reuniting people like never before. People are putting aside their political differences and are joining forces to stop the elite, to take back the money which they wrongfully stole from us, and to start to rebuild the companies that were almost completely destroyed because of the lockdowns.</p>
<p>We HAVE to join in. We HAVE to take this chance to rebuild the bridges between us that the rich have burnt with the lockdowns and the mask orders. We HAVE to take this chance, this ONE chance, to work together and smash the common enemy who is in no small part responsible for subjugating us before they convince us to destroy each other!</p>
<p>And we can do it!</p>
<p>Go get an account on Fidelity or Vanguard. Then, go buy $GME and $AMC stocks, for GameStop and AMC Theater Company respectively. Buy the SHIT out of them and then HOLD them. DO NOT SELL THEM FOR ANY REASON NO MATTER HOW HIGH OR LOW THE PRICE GOES.</p>
<p>The rich has gotten the media to blatantly LIE to break the fellowship and convince people to sell. DO NOT LISTEN TO ANY BULLSHIT YOU SEE ON THE NEWS. GO TO /r/WALLSTREETBETS FOR UPDATES.</p>
<p><strong>NO MATTER IF YOU ARE LEFT OR RIGHT, RED OR BLUE, BLACK OR WHITE, REMEMBER THAT WE ARE ALL AMERICANS, THAT THIS IS OUR COUNTRY, AND THIS IS OUR ONE CHANCE TO COME BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THEY CAN'T TYRANNIZE US IF THEY ARE FUCKING BANKRUPT!</strong></p>
<p><strong>SO LET'S TAKE THAT SHIT BACK, ROME STYLE, AND TAKE $GME AND $AMC TO THE FUCKING MOON!</strong></p>
<p><strong>APES TOGETHER STRONG!</strong></p></p>

        <p>If we work together and use this methodology we really can take down the elites, and much more importantly, by giving the people a cause to bring us together and not tear each other apart. That's why it is so important we get in on it. We can definitely save AMC which is in danger of bankruptcy because of the lockdowns.</p>

<p>Plenty of hedgefunds went long, and most likely the price variance we are seeing now is those hedgefunds taking their profits. The retail investors who learned about this after it blew up and are jumping in now are not sticking it to the man, they are funding their exit. Remember 2008? Yeah, there were some bankruptcies, and Melvin Capital likely will go, but most of them are going to be making fat stacks.</p>

        <p>Oh let's be clear, no one spend money that you can't afford, none of this is financial advice, I just like the stock.</p>
<p>But it will work. They were caught holding naked shorts on GME, more shorts than there were actual stocks. They caught them with their pants down. It will work, just trust the process.</p>

        <p>Here's the problem: Gamestop doesn't produce enough profit to justify $300 a share, or wherever it is right now. Manipulating their stock price won't fix that. At some point, the price must return to the natural value. What happens to retail investors then?</p>

        <p>Ok, I'm pro the GME buy/hold/fuck the hedge funds movement, but the idea that this will end lockdowns is fucking ridiculous. The financial players with a stake in keeping lockdown going aren't just hedge funds, they're Google, Amazon, Mastercard, Facebook, Pfizer, the Gates Foundation/GAVI, World Economic Forum...not just parasitic traders but big ass blue chip corporations. (Which are also parasitic, but in a much worse way than just money, because they want to convert every bit of your life into data that they then "nudge" via proprietary algorithms.)</p>

        <p>It will help end them because it's a useful strategy we can use against ALL of the big name companies over the year, and more importantly because it is already doing what we couldn't to bridge the divide between politicsl factions and reunite the country against the elite, the #1 most important thing that has to be done to end their power. </p>
