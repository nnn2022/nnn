    <strong>New Here</strong>
    <p><p>I found you all a few weeks ago, joined, and have been lurking ever since, taking in this new-to-me perspective.</p>
<p>I'm a teacher. I spent last summer glued to the tv soaking in all the fear around Covid. I was terrified to go back to school in the fall (it didn't help that at our school's entrance was an "enter at your own risk" sign. I shit you not. It was up for the first three weeks of school while teachers taught remotely from our classrooms, but as soon as students started coming on campus it was removed). I had two major panic attacks in August. On my commute to school, there were days when I would pull over and throw up on the side of the road my anxiety was so bad. I was fully convinced that I would probably contract Covid and die over the course of the year (I'm an incredibly healthy 43-year old woman).</p>
<p>I live in a rural area - I know two adults who got Covid (who both said it was "a bad, bad cold") and one of my students (high school) and one of his parents contracted Covid. My husband and I suspect we both had it in Feb. 2020 (his was pretty bad, mine was two weeks later and pretty mild). The area I live. in is incredibly blue, my state is purple. So everyone I know is vaccinated. I am not (neither is my husband). I've been trying to decide whether or not I should get vaccinated before I return to my classroom in the fall, where I suspect things will be "back to normal." ;)</p>
<p>I've been treated very poorly by colleagues once they found out I wasn't vaccinated (vaccines for teachers opened up in my state around March of this year and all of my colleagues were scrambling over each other to get their experimental shot). I'm very worried that teachers will be forced to be vaccinated before school begins in the fall.</p>
<p>And then I found you all. And things are starting to make more sense to me. I'm still wary as I am still trying to sus out what's propaganda from any "side" and what's reality, but I think I'm getting closer every day to figuring that out, too.</p>
<p>Can't wait for my first auto-ban from other subs...</p></p>

        <p>Unvaxxed caregiver here. Not as impressive as microbiologist. From what I've seen in the assisted living facility I work at the "vaccine" is more dangerous than covid. We have had three outbreaks of covid. None of them have died or even needed to go to the hospital. After everyone got the drug we had several go to the hospital and a couple of them died.</p>

        <p>That isn’t too surprising to hear, we see the same thing with our inpatients and ED admissions at our hospital. Unfortunately most of our department is muzzled from the top down. Threats of losing licenses etc. We mostly whisper among ourselves about how much worse it is going to get before things turn around (if ever).</p>

        <p>Hey there, and welcome from the UK.</p>
<p>You’re going to suffer a lot of noise from the other side by being part of this but it’s great to have you here. It’s especially important for children and my children who cannot yet understand what is being forced upon them against their will. We need teachers out there still with open minds protecting them from this criminal activity. We’re knee deep in history repeating itself right now and it’s so much bigger than any of us.</p>

        <p>Just remember - don't ever become blinkered to one side or the other. Make a concerted effort to balance your sources. For every BBC article, have a look at UK column for example.</p>
<p>Whatever people say, the ultimate choice on being vaccinated is yours and yours alone. No one should judge you for applying your own assessment of risk when it comes to your health.</p>
<p>As I have said elsewhere, regardless of what many are being forcefed to think, it is imoral for society to require vaccination in order to opt-in to civil privilages.</p>
<p>Be steadfast in what you think, but don't be afraid to chance your mind and eat a little humble pie if the balance of risk changes.</p>
<p>I consider that I am currently taking a 'wait and see' stance. That is by far the safest and most cautious approach in my view.</p>
<p>All the best my friend.</p>

<p>I haven't been auto-banned because I participate in this sub. At least not yet.</p>
<p>I think if you take care of yourself, you will probably be fine. Get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, take a multivitamin, exercise regularly, and get some fresh air and sunshine. I know of several people who have gotten it and none of them had serious symptoms. Two people were in their very late 80s and had an overnight hospital stay, but they're fine now.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the sub, we are growing by the day. It is alarming how  friends you have quickly treat you like second class citizens because you don't want to do permanent damage to your health/body. </p>
<p>Remember, all this happened because China start leaking vdos of people dropping dead in the streets around Nov-Dec 2019. Is that happening here? If not what is the purpose of those leaked vdos from China?</p>

        <p>You should for sure take vitamin D and zinc. There is evidence coming out that dandelion leaves of all things can mitigate the spike protein damage. I have a study saved on my laptop but I’m on my mobile right now. I’ll link it later if I remember. </p>
<p>If you can get a hold of some ivermectin definitely take that. If you’re in the USA you can get it through America’s Frontline Doctors. </p>
<p>There are a few doctors that’s have websites up talking about how to mitigate the damage. You can do a search for them. I’ll link them as well later.</p>

<p>I’m sorry you had to go through all that stress. I could only imagine how tough it must of been to switch to online classes, while simultaneously being told that this virus is going to kill everyone you love by the media. </p>

        <p>Nofap, cold showers, meditation, &amp; hard cardio have done wonders for my panic attacks, i got it down to zero when it used to be a daily thing. Sun gazing can also promote a tranquil feeling by decalcifying &amp; possibly enlaring your pineal gland or "3rd eye" </p>
<p>Ivermectin works against all the variants, I'm currently using the durvet brand for horses cus it's cheap &amp; works just as good for humans</p>
