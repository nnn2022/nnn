        <p>People have been downvoting me on here for pointing this out in another post, but I am not seeing this as good news. If anything, the fact this is being slated as the next carrot they want to dangle on a string for the masses to return to normal is worrying. I am seeing a lot of "well, this is great, now we just need to get this vaccine and we get our lives back". It seems that even people who are against the New Normal are suggesting we need to get this vaccine, and don't seem to mind the notion that it could become mandatory.</p>
<p>I'm not anti-vaxx. However, this is the fastest developed vaccine in history. There has been little to no research on potential long term effects. There are many problems I can see coming about from this vaccine, and the scary part is that Pfizer and any other company involved in creating these vaccines are free of any liability, so if there are any vaccine related injuries or deaths, nothing can be done about them. Does no one else see the possible dangers of this vaccine, especially if it's mandatory?</p>

        <p>I not a conspiracy theorist. I have no agenda. Im not anti vax. But im afraid of the mRNA vax and im afraid that the safety testing isn't several years long like other vaccinations. Im afraid of developing an autoimmune condition or cancer 5/10 years down the line, as mRNA vax have the potential to cause. and im afraid as mRNA vaccinations haven't been used on human before so again there's no longevity studies.</p>

        <p>Doing unknown drugs is not "great" and never was</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>&rt; I'm not anti-vaxx.  </p>
<p>btw that anti-vaxx term reminds of x-termed words used for adult content. Makes you wonder who promotes them and why, other than the pharma-gov cartel. </p>
<p>When something (a drug in this case) is mandatory it means it doesn't really work. Because it doesn't need to be mandatory if it's truly essential and truly functional. Drinking water for instance, isn't mandatory.</p>

        <p>The pro lockdown and restriction people I knows predicts there won't be any old normal before summer 2021 if it goes as planned. If delays happen, they expect summer 2022.</p>
<p>Then I asked them: "What would you suggest if a vaccine didn't exist and would never exist? Lockdown for 5 years, 10 years, century or forever?". The answer was having a back and forth lockdown and restriction forever because of humanity won't be able to succeed without it, they said. Basically living like this rest of our lives. They says it doesn't matter for them if they gets Ebola, COVID19 or the black plague because of it's all the same concept, but different origins.</p>
<p>If it was an airborne Ebola half of humanity may have been wiped out in theory, but that's not the case with the COVID19 which has 99,8% survival chance. I don't want to die, but I would rather have quality than quantity in my life and be peace with the risk. I don't think humans can always control death or illness despite good technology. There's none's fault people dies and none other than the virus should get blamed.</p>

        <p>I hate this.</p>
<p>But at the same time I am terrified of lockdowns.</p>
<p>Please, don't judge me. I am not really happy about the vaccine, but the thought of being able to plan something without the wear of a sudden lockdown is something I need.</p>

        <p>&rt; But at the same time I am terrified of lockdowns.</p>
<p>So am I.</p>
<p>I'm also terrified of this vaccine causing cancer, sterility, brain damage, and so on. Lockdowns can potentially ruin the economy and affect people's lives, while the vaccine can potentially end lives or degrade them to point where many will want to end up dead.</p>
<p>Pick your poison, I guess...</p>
