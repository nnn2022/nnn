    <strong>How do people actually want lockdown to never end? What benefit does this give them?</strong>
    <p><p>What do they get from wanting the government to take away their freedom? Why does common sense that they understand suddenly stop working when it's related to COVID? Are those people normal humans? Are they being paid by the government? How would most of the population suddenly not understand common sense when it's about COVID, and are following the same orders without question? Are most people built differently than us?</p></p>

        <p>Two types of people want this.  The first is the lazy bum that would rather get a government check than work.  The second is the paranoid schizophrenic that thinks they're going to die if they are out in public without a mask.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly these people don't know what's going on with supply lines and inflation due to lockdowns, people not wanting to go to work, and governments spending trillions they don't have.  I fear it will only get worse as time goes on.</p>

        <p>It absolves them of responsibility, that way they're not the reason their lives are shit, they can blame the lockdowns. Here watch this, this is a great example of exactly who they are</p>

        <p>Different people will have different reasons. Here's just two reasons from people I know:</p>
<p>A former friend is now working from home. She prefers this to working at work significantly and wants it to last forever. She doesn't give a fuck about anybody else as long as she gets what she wants. </p>
<p>A friend's boyfriend has permanently damaged lungs and had COVID-19 last year. She's adamant that COVID caused it and the fact that he recovered from cancer and started smoking again has nothing to do with it. She and hundreds of people she knows only had mild symptoms and have no permanent damage. However, because ONE loved person suffered she can't look at the bigger picture and wants everyone in lockdown until SARS-CoV2 is completely eradicated (so forever...) to 'save them from COVID'.</p>

        <p>A lot want to return to normalcy, but they're angry because they believe the maskless groups are the ones responsible delaying the return.  Even worse are the ones who took the shot "to get their freedom back." That's not even close to how freedom works. </p>
<p>If I can narrow it down, it would be the addiction to the fear porn.</p>

        <p>To them it's not about having their freedom taken away, it's about being relieved of the burden of responsibility- in exchange they get to cower behind an ineffectual mask and yell at nonconformists who dare to think for themselves.</p>
<p>This "unprecedented times" environment conveys a false sense of superiority and they do not want to give that up.</p>

        <p>IMO, far too many are unsocialized &amp; never had friends or went out anyway. (Neck bearded basement dweller) Now? They are heroes instead of losers. Why would they ever want everyone else forced to do what they were doing by choice? </p>
<p>Others have found they love "WFH" &amp; never wantto go back to an office. (Including many still making a salary as if they lived in expensive cities, but moved to far cheaper places!) Why would they ever want that to change? </p>
<p>Then, at the tail-end is those getting the increased unemployment to stay home &amp; get stoned all day. They also never want that to change.</p>

        <p>I think it gives purpose to a group of people that have no other way of contributing.  When you here how Just by staying home you are a hero and saving lives.  Most people never hear that in their lives.  Now by being timid and being in lockdown they get to feel like they are contributing.</p>

        <p>They have never owned a small business, are extremely susceptible to propaganda, and have cognitive dissonance.
These people should be upset that their governments are not looking into how this happened and how to prevent and future pandemics.</p>
