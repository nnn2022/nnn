    <strong>Being called right wing when im actually pretty liberal</strong>
    <p><p>I dont know how much the mods will allow political chat happen in this subreddit, but i think i wanted to bring to light the difference. Im gonna guess that a good number of you are more center or lean right. Lets just put it this way, i use to watch youtube channels like the young turks, Secular talk and the rational national pretty often as my fix for information. When covid came around i was unware like everyone else and was afraid of what Covid could become. Fast Forward to the spring of 2020 and we learned about more of the data, i came to the conclusion that its not as bad as once thought and hopefully people will realize that; but the problem is those channels i looked at were actually Doomers and they were blindly following what the MSM said in terms of Covid. Heres 3 things i knew by the summer of 2020</p>
<ol>
<li>the deathrate is less than .025 for most age groups under the age of 50 and the overall death toll is overcounted, meaning anytime someone dies from something, if people think they have covid, they can mark it as "Covid death". Anyone on the left who kept fearmongering about the 6 figure death count i knew werent actually informed.</li>
<li>Masks were being weaponize for virtue signaling- Doomers would basically make it their job to shame people who chose not to wear a mask.</li>
<li>Fauci and our health officials were full of shit- With me seeing that the deathrate was being overreported i quickly realized that we were being lied to. The youtube channels that didnt see that, shouldnt be trusted because they cant do their own research when the Fauci and others have been bullshitting people from the start to cause lockdowns and everything.</li>
</ol>
<p>It actually makes me depressed that Covid has changed my point of view on some people. Dont get me wrong, my beliefs are still the same; like im pro-choice and i dont like republicans because of their spending positions. But Ive actually been watching channels like Louder with Crowder and Ben shapiro, because while i disagree with them on 80% of their positions, but  when it comes to covid they actually arent idiots.</p></p>

        <p>I‚Äôve had the same revolution for the same reasons. I knew by June the numbers were false (PCR cycle rate) and the disease was mortal to the same age cohort as in March and was not killing others in the same proportion. </p>
<p>The MSCNN hypocrisy of anti-lockdown protest/dissent vs BLM coverage especially was the nail in the coffin for any progressivist views I had. I now view the year 2020 as a psy-op of tremendous proportions. Call me paranoid, but there it is. It hit me when I suddenly saw the BLM slogan ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe‚Äù used when juxtaposed with the symptoms of covid itself and the mask-wearing, as parts of the same ‚Äúnarrative.‚Äù Quite a subconscious associational memetic ‚Äúcoincidence,‚Äù that.</p>

        <p>People wanted Obama because CHANGE. When we got more of the same, it makes sense that people who wanted actual change would try something else. I believe Michael Moore said something to the effect "Trump was like a grenade lobbed at Washington". People were upset in 2016, in 2020 people were pissed. </p>
<p>Now people are furious.</p>

        <p>One of the biggest things that happened to me over the last couple of years is I don't ascribe to any particular ideology or political party anymore. I was headed in that direction to begin with but now I'm fully there. I think when people call one another leftist and right-wingers it's often used as an insult to discredit the person and box them into a category. People seem to love compartmentalizing everything, it breaks thing down for them it makes it easier for them to process. There's far less thinking involved when you make sweeping generalizations about someone being all bad or all good and there's nothing in between. It shuts down conversations and silences people. Anyone who does this is lazy and or not too bright.</p>

        <p>Center libertarian here. The republicans are as reasonable as the left is for the most part. Since Trump was president, the MSM has become such insane propaganda that the repilublicans look even more reasonable by comparison. </p>

        <p>yeah, thats the other thing....Since trump has left office, its a weird time for progressives in that the doomers who spent 8 months saying trump is a murderer when they quoted the death counts cant do that anymore lol. Also agree that democratic States that being more strict when it comes to covid are gonna be hit hard when it comes to the midterms, and thats self-harmed.</p>

        <p>Most of my circles are liberal or left-leaning. I‚Äôve considered myself left-leaning, and still do side with the left on a number of issues; but as a whole, the left is really not questioning the MSM narrative. And honestly, I might not be much either if I hadn‚Äôt lived with a group of Christian conservatives for 8 months last year who opened my eyes to many things - some of which I passionately agree with.</p>
<p>I swung hard on the pendulum and am now living with a very liberal group... I like that this group cares about nature as much as I do and are wonderful people but I really miss the rebelliousness of the last group. None of them got the jab and they gave the mask mandates the middle finger from the beginning. At the time I thought they were being extreme, but knowing what I know now, they were right on.</p>
<p>Most of the dissenting voices I‚Äôve started following in the last few months have political/social views that lean right or present as apolitical. So be it...I‚Äôm always willing to question what I believe. Health freedom/sovereignty has become a critical topic to me and I follow/join with others who feel the same, regardless of differing beliefs. </p>
<p>Question everything...especially the most commonly held notions. Deception, lies, misleading info, half-truths are almost everywhere you look. Whoever is questioning all this bullshit is a homie in my book.</p>

        <p>The modern "left" in America has just been completely co-opted by the media and big corporations, ironically so. Woke and cancel culture, identity politics, and niche cultural issues dominate the left today, because the second everyone starts giving a shit about class and economic inequality instead of all this race-baiting shit, these big pharmaceutical companies and the sensationalist fear-mongering media will be done for.</p>

        <p>I am life long progressive democrat, largely because I naively believed I was on the side of what was best for humanity. My cognitive dissonance busted to pieces after I had become vocal during the ‚ÄúMe too‚Äù movement and allied alongside BLM, and then was given Biden and Harris as DNC nominees. Those two embodied everything we had fought so hard against, and the hypocrisy of putting them in the White House to get rid of Orange man was too much for me. </p>
<p>The more I learned the angrier I became, and the more I tried to speak up on it, the more people I upset. I wasn‚Äôt just upsetting virtual strangers, my questions and concerns starting making my loved ones uncomfortable and upset. Which made me stop discussing my questions and concerns with anyone. Well, until I found NNN :) this virtual community has helped me feel less crazy and isolated. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs a strange sensation to have our fellow humanity loving folks turn on humanity so quickly. But under the belief that they are saving it. If anything it shows how effective fear is.</p>

        <p>Nahhhhh, Jimmy Dore is a slighty less blowhard but is still basically on the same level in terms of annoyance. Idk if you read what happened before Dore left TYT, apparently Dore was joking with Ana Kasparian when she has a small skirt on and they took that as "sexual harassment". My stance is, all these people are wealthy fucks that level in California that have basically doubled down on woke politics. I just cant take someone at their word when they make 6-7 figure income and they live in the most expensive state.</p>

        <p>The left didn't fuck up, what you're seeing right now is what happens when you engage in identity politics without bringing in the banner of peace before hand.  People like to claim that the right is pure IDpol it's not.  Think on it, what are some of the key things that define current left wing politics in the west?  Race, sex, sexual orientation, and other immutable characteristics.  People who are a minority(or particular race) are given more sway then a person with good ideas.  People who've transitioned to another sex are given more sway then a person who hasn't.   People who hold the "ideology to their heart" are more important than the person who can implement good policy.  Minor things like the "appeal of authority" on an issue has more hold on the left than it does on the right(several people in this post mentioned how fucked up the DNC/Biden stuff is - the very people they claim to hate and dislike are running the show).  Struggle sessions are the norm among the left, apologizing for your race is good.  Denigrating half the population based on sex is good.  And so on.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean there aren't problems on the right, there's plenty.  And you're not really wrong on the political parties all marching to the same drum.  See the "build back better" bullshit, and how many of them from left to right who claim to be the opposite all marching together. </p>
<p>But if you think things are bad in the US, they're exceptionally bad here in Canada.  Think your media is bad? Ours is now on the federal payroll.  Our main political parties are all marching to the same drum.  From far-left to right, or supposed right wing.  Green, NDP, Liberals, CPC(really they're CINOs).  The CPC has gotten so bad that they hold 90% of the same policy positions as the Liberals, just "less" of those policies by around 6-10%, and I'm not kidding.  The PPC(Peoples Party of Canada) that they call "far right wing extremists" holds the same party polices that the CPC had not more than 10 years ago, something as simple as reducing immigration to 2005 levels is a "neo-nazi idea."  On top of that, the Liberals just passed bill C-10(stalled in senate) which implements censorship and information control.  Next they've just introduced C-36, which effectively makes thought crimes an actual offence, allows for secret courts, allows for charges to be brought against you without being able to face your accuser ever, and allows them to put you into jail or remand to psychiatric facility without the current safe guards afforded under the Charter, can seize your money without the courts involved, and on and on and on.  </p>
<p>Simply put? Those two laws make Canada into Venezuela and Cuba all in one go.</p>

        <p>You can be proud of yourself that you actually stood up to your friends, the propaganda, and the intimidation associated with going against the crowd.  That is not an easy task.</p>
<p>It feels like you have chosen to be honest with yourself.  May you always do so no matter what side of the political spectrum you currently happen to find yourself supporting.  </p>
<p>Many of us here used to be "on the left" as well.  But, in my case anyway, I can no longer lie to myself.  That's pretty much what it comes down to.</p>

        <p>I am strongly conservative, and by that statement alone you will misconstrue where I stand.  I am NOT a Republican.  I don't support either party, they're corrupt.  My beliefs lie solely in the Constitution.  I have zero problem with equal rights for the gay community or any community, I do not oppose abortion from a legal standpoint(I would like to reduce the reasons why people choose that option, I will never vote against their choice to choose it).  No I am not an XYZ label you want to throw on me, not moderate, not libertarian leaning, etc, I am whole heartedly a conservative.  Having said that, one thing I really and truly miss, is the opportunity to speak freely with other people in my life with opposing views. Let's just respectfully talk.  For a moment in time, that was not a big deal.  There is a reason why people have been willing to accept, and adapt to, so many different ways of life, even if they didn't necessarily agree or relate to it.  Look at the pride movement, it's a common place occurrence now all over the U.S.A.  It's accepted as a part of our culture in the vast majority of places.  Are there exceptions? Sure, that isn't the horrible thing people take it as.  Opposition should make you stronger, kill them with kindness and you will win.  That's what I saw the majority of my life, and it's worked.  The violence we see today, will not end well.  Violence will bring more violence, and it's severely misdirected.</p>

<p>If you and I meet and label ourselves as a liberal and a conservative, we are immediately at odds with each other without another word. If we just have our opinions on something, we may even find that we agree. If not, at least there is still a basis for a polite, respectful disagreement.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I've been called alt right too for not trusting the vaccine when I'm actually pretty left leaning economically: pro drug decriminalization, in favor of banning private investment companies from owning residential real estate, in favor of blocking companies from the UK market if they use offshores to tax dodge, in favor of benefits and safety nets etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand individual freedom is very important so I guess supporting that, doing my own research on experimental gene therapy and saying the immune system is real must mean I support radical ideas....like being able to go out without a face diaper, society going back to normal, having shops, pubs, restaurants and other businesses open without idiotic restrictions, people having jobs again and being able to work from the office so you don't spend 90% of your life in one room, kids going to school not having to live through a dystopia, being able to get treatment for serious diseases or being able to attend mental health support groups. Well, yeah I guess that sounds very fascist.</p>

        <p>The dissent against the globalist authoritarian elite is occurring mostly on the right at this time. Too much of the left has been taken over and brainwashed out of their classical liberal values. Therefore, you get branded as a far-right nut if you oppose any facet the "mainstream" narrative. It's the ~~best~~ laziest way they have to discredit your opinion, even though you may not actually identify as conservative.</p>

        <p>I know how you feel; I'm a leftie myself, just not the authoritarian kind (yes, we do exist), but I've found myself on the other side of the aisle over the course of the last year, not because I left the left, but because it left me, basically. </p>
<p>Honestly, at this point, I think the only division that really matters is between those who prioritize freedom over safety and those who prioritize safety over freedom. That's the only "political" divide that matters anymore, and I'll gladly side with anyone who opposes mandatory lockdowns and other such nonsense, regardless of their views on other topics.</p>

        <p>You know in the aftermath of Charlottesville I had a Twitter account with 300 followers mostly sports fans and personal friends. I asked a jounrnalist with 10,000 followers when it‚Äôs okay to physically defend ourselves against nazis. Mike Cernovich, a then-popular right wing commentator Re-tweeted me to his six figure audience claiming I would attack anyone who came to my business. I got death threats. I got doxxed. </p>
<p>Milo Yionappolis came to my alma mater and put a picture of a professor here he disagreed with up on a screen with the words ‚ÄúFAT F-SLUR‚Äù in huge letters to hundreds of students on campus and tens of thousands of Breitbart viewers. He got so many death threats the university had to put him up in a hotel for his safety. </p>
<p>Nobody cares about your bad takes. We‚Äôd rather you didn‚Äôt have them, but whatever. But when you have a big audience that you convince are engaged in warfare or the control of some hierarchical entitlements, then tell your audience that people with 300 followers are the enemy, you‚Äôre not engaged in speech. You‚Äôre engaged in promoting terrorism. See Jan. 6 and Charlottesville. </p>
<p>Where was my freedom of speech? Where was the professor‚Äôs freedom of speech? You good allowing these shills to terrorize ordinary Americans and forcing a news site to publish whatever you want? If so, I don‚Äôt think you have the first idea what freedom is. </p>
