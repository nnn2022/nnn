    <strong>Can someone explain why Russel Brand of all people discusses Covid laws, Great Reset etc</strong>
    <p><p>Like most of this guys channel seems to have moved to discussing conspiracy theories like the Great Reset, Mainstream media and Covid laws and speaks alot about the WEF but this guy is a comedian from shitty movies. Why <em>him</em>?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Might be off topic</p></p>

        <p>Russell Brand is actually quite open minded, quick, and intelligent. </p>
<p>I don't like any of his comedy, but he is not a dumb man and can be very insightful. Watched a decent interview with him last night with Jordan Peterson and his daughter.</p>

        <p>This may be an unpopular opinion- I find his comedy and roles in movies revolting for the most part. However, outside of Hollywood he has been on multiple podcasts and his own YT channel and seems to have a philosophy to question everything and be open minded to other points of view. I, for one, can appreciate that. Even when he doesn’t agree with someone, he appears to respect their opinion. I haven’t seen every interview of his, so maybe I missed one where he’s a prick, but he seems open minded.</p>

        <p>Maybe its just who he is that makes me question it, similar to how i question why Bill Gates, the windows guy, is an expert now. It just seemed a bit weird to me</p>

        <p>I would suggest that he is controlled opposition. He once dated the known satanist Katy Perry so he has undoubtedly been introduced to some of the higher ups. He is clearly not stupid and this will have been noted and utilised. I admit that I don't listen to him because of his previous affiliations with celebrity and Hollywood, but I guess somewhere down the line he will suggest something that aligns with the consensus.</p>

        <p>I'm not denying that a controlled opposition exists, but have a hard time thinking he's a part of it. When I think controlled opposition, I think- Fox News. If you listen to Russel, he's not not only speaking against "the state", totalitarian powers, and "forever wars", but also makes some good observations about the counterproductive direction we're heading. I know KP has had some satanic themes in videos, but what makes people so sure that celebrities photographed covering one eye are satanists, rather than the producers?</p>

        <p>One easy way to find out. Does he speak out against the vaccines being rushed, heavily coerced, new tech, no long term stud? . Does he give a voice to people speaking out against the vaccines? Does he speak out against the other invisible enemy, climate change? Does he give a voice to those people?</p>
<p>If the answers to the above are No, then he is without question controlled opposition.</p>

        <p>I don't exactly appreciate the satirical spin he puts on these subjects, but I have watched his last couple videos about the Great Reset. His stance is against tyranny and centralized powers becoming more powerful, so I appreciate him bringing more attention to these topics when most people don't know who Klaus Schwab is. He takes the time to explain some of the concerning points, while also adding some humor.. If it causes anyone to investigate further, I'm on board with it!</p>

        <p>Comedians are some of the most important philosophers of the day.  George Carlin said years ago, many things that are relevant to the current tyranny, and Russel Brand is now doing the same.  He seems more introspective about it and isn't doing it just to be funny though.  He has on well-educated guests, and asks them all of the relevant questions.</p>

        <p>His stance on corruption, freedom and politics isn't new. He's not an idiot and he's quiet open minded. Also people change and evolve. He went too far in the great reset criticism / exposing them to be a controlled opposition. He also openly criticized gates, the royal family, the UK government etc</p>
