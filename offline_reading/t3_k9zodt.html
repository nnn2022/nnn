    <strong>My daily decision. Stay informed and go crazy or ignore everything and be a blissful idiot?</strong>
    <p><p>I think it's my responsibility as a citizen to be knowledgeable regarding current events.  Unfortunately reading about current events <em>"in these unprecedented times"</em> causes me to become enraged or hopeless.  I've found that ignoring news and social media greatly helps my peace of mind, but ultimately is not a feasible option long term.  So how can I resolve this problem? Here's what I've been reading so far today...</p>
<p>Scrolled through r/Coronavirus, which is rare.  Read thread about a poll showing only 42% of blacks said they would get the COVID vaccine.  Distrust of the government in general and specific historical problems (Tuskegee syphilis study, disparity of health care between whites and blacks) are cited as reasons.</p>
<p>Found article that referenced a tweet from Chicago teachers union who claimed in a now deleted post that the push to reopen schools is "rooted in sexism, racism, and misogyny"</p>
<p>Read NYT story with the headline "12,000 more white children return to NYC schools than black children".  Article laments the racial disparity of those returning to school, since remote learning has proven far less effective than in person classes.  The story says that black families are don't want to send their kids back because they don't trust the schools to keep their kids safe during the pandemic.</p>
<p>So.........society has now pinned all hopes of returning to "normal" on this miracle vaccine.  That's the only way out of this pandemic (according to the experts who dominate public opinion).  Less than half of African Americans trust the vaccine.  Fear of COVID is preventing many NYC black families from allowing their children to return to school.  This will cause more black children to fall behind, which will increase problems in the black community.  But pushing to get kids back in school prompted a large teacher's union to scream racism, and is cited as a valid concern because of claims that the black community has suffered disproportionately from COVID.  It seems like a circular clusterfuck...an unstoppable force meets an immovable object paradox.  </p>
<p>This is where the fear mongering and myth of the miracle vaccine has got us.  Neck deep in a pile of bullshit.</p></p>

        <p>My goal is to find that perfect balance of seeing all the craziness that is going on in the world while simultaneously realizing I can't change the world and instead should focus on simply being the best person I can be. I think we on the sub think we're somehow holier than all the sheep who aren't questioning things, which creates a very judgmental attitude that I personally feel is destroying my emotional health. It's a very tough fucking thing to walk this fine line but I hope it's possible for us.</p>

        <p>You can learn more about how to correctly keep your emotions in perspective, just like you make it your duty to learn the truth about this scam. Make it your duty to study yourself. </p>
<p>Also, I never check mainstream reddit, and limit the amount of mainstream propaganda I consume. Is important to limit that nonsense.</p>
