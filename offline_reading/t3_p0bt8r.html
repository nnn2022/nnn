    <strong>Effective protest ideas</strong>
    <p><p>I’m in Australia. The police seem to be pretty tough on protesters recently. We are also experiencing something similar to the early UK protests where the media label the protests as far right and violent. I believe many people here and in other countries are looking for a peaceful and effective way for their voice to be heard today. To go on record now with a peaceful statement of non-compliance. Could a date be organised where people queue at their local police station with the intention of being fined and/or arrested peacefully?  With enough numbers of peaceful individuals who wish their opinion to be recorded officially because no other avenues are currently available it would create a lot of paperwork and court dates. It would also be hard for the media to label the protest as violent or right wing in any way.</p></p>

        <p>Got it. I see you are even more black pill doomer than me. Your are probably right and it’s over already. I will keep a grain of hope until I think I definitely done. Maybe we agree on everything just a few months apart on a few things perhaps. I’m just hoping that that we can get an idea of numbers from a large, definitely peaceful event. If everyone there is prepared to be arrested and fined it takes away the entire threat the state has at this point. Good luck though, wish I was in a country that we could get protective weapons like you are.</p>

        <p>Actually, I live in the UK, the most disarmed nation in Europe. You can own a crossbow and that's as good as it gets. Legally owning firearms is so difficult it's not worth it.</p>
<p>I don't believe it's over already but I think we have to accept all the institutions of governments have been compromised and reliance on the law isn't going to save us. If the state has become fascist do you really want to have the police put a mark on your record?</p>

        <p>They have all the lists they need at this point.  I’m not scared of a fine and an arrest for a peaceful protest at this point. I’m interested in seeing how many are ready to consciously, peacefully not comply anymore.</p>

        <p>Hey you can’t edit the comment as I reply! 🤣 I don’t see it as submitting myself to the state at all. Just taking away the threat they are using. I don’t care about the fine and will happily have a day in their court to present my opinion. It also take away the power the media has to control the narrative of protests. People should queue with their family. Have a fun day queuing up. Being balloons and food. Street party peaceful arrest party.</p>

        <p>Sorry to break it to you, but they know there is dissent and they don't care. People going out in the streets, chanting and holding up signs is accomplishing nothing. I'd say what we all know deep down needs to be done but I'd probably be banned.</p>

        <p>yup, </p>
<p>I often wonder why people back in the day didnt all just sign a petition and hand it to Hitler, we could have avoided all the unpleasantness. </p>
<p>Or maybe swarmed and occupied the concentration camps, that would have shown them.</p>

        <p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Honestly, it's really sad to see how many people hold onto this mistaken belief that <em>any</em> government actually cares about what the people want. They don't. We're seen as their property and being given the illusion that our voices matter to them is nothing but a control tactic. </p>
<p>Australia is the perfect example at the moment. Why do people think they have the whole police force out and military roaming the streets? This wouldn't be seen as necessary if they were under the assumption that everyone is on board. They know they aren't. So, they intend of forcing it. Some symbolic gesture or plea written on card stock isn't going to wake them up, make them say "Oh, golly, we're sorry!"</p>
<p>I feel bad for those that are in countries that don't even have the means of possessing any real self-defense.</p>

        <p>I agree, the ones pulling the strings don’t care the dissent at this stage. All I’m saying it’s hard to get huge numbers to protests if people think they will labeled right wing and violent. I’m open to ideas that will create large numbers and send a message of non compliance. I think when actual numbers are shown, anything can be achieved going forward.</p>

        <p>Nah not working is fine with them. That helps UBI introduction. Take money from the bank and use as cash instead of card, that I agree with. Protesting today, in my country anyway, carries the risk of arrest and fine anyway. This approach just takes the threat they are using away from the state and allows real numbers to be seen.

        <p>Alternatively, hundreds of people could email a bunch of journalists and clog their inbox. Basically asking why they are being cowards and not asking the real questions at press conferences. PCR tests, isolation of the virus, lockdowns of Sweden vs. UK or North Dakota vs. South Dakota, how many people in hospital are vaccinated, if getting covid is safer than the vax, bacterial pneumonia due to masks?....

        <p>You have to turn your perceived weaknesses into strengths.  You have to use probability to your advantage.  You have to think long-term.  Most importantly, you have to walk The Path of The Pono.  </p>
<p>99.9% of the people of Australia, like americans, europeans, and japanese are privileged pansies.  They will never take any significant risks.  Getting arrested is too much of an inconvenience for them.  </p>
<p>Find a town in the region that's most sympathetic to your cause.  Get as many people (non-pansies) as you can to move there with you.  If there's only one hardware store and the owner requires masks, rent the building across the street and put them out of business, then move on to the next town and do the same thing.  </p>
<p>If you're a person of faith it will never work, however, because faith is the reason that the world is in it's current predicament.</p>
