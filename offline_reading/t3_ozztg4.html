        <p>246 participants, in a non-controlled environment, and THIS is the basis, for a 2.5 times less likelihood of contracting a coronavirus-induced head cold? It’s no wonder then that;</p>
<p>Although laboratory evidence suggests that antibody responses following COVID-19 vaccination provide better neutralization of some circulating variants than does natural infection (1,2), few real-world epidemiologic studies exist to support the benefit of vaccination for previously infected persons.</p>

        <p>Copy &amp; paste from the study </p>
<p>The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, reinfection was not confirmed through whole genome sequencing, which would be necessary to definitively prove that the reinfection was caused from a distinct virus rela- tive to the first infection. Although in some cases the repeat positive test could be indicative of prolonged viral shedding or failure to clear the initial viral infection (9), given the time between initial and subsequent positive molecular tests among participants in this study, reinfection is the most likely explanation. Second, persons who have been vaccinated are possibly less likely to get tested. Therefore, the association of reinfection and lack of vaccination might be overestimated. Third, vaccine doses administered at federal or out-of-state sites are not typically entered in KYIR, so vaccination data are pos- sibly missing for some persons in these analyses. In addition, inconsistencies in name and date of birth between KYIR and NEDSS might limit ability to match the two databases. Because case investigations include questions regarding vaccination, and KYIR might be updated during the case investigation process, vaccination data might be more likely to be missing for controls. Thus, the OR might be even more favorable for vaccination. Fourth, although case-patients and controls were matched based on age, sex, and date of initial infection, other unknown confounders might be present. Finally, this is a ret- rospective study design using data from a single state during a 2-month period; therefore, these findings cannot be used to infer causation. Additional prospective studies with larger populations are warranted to support these findings.</p>

        <h1>This is a false and deeply misleading title.  This is cynical disinformation on the part of the CDC.</h1>
<p>Vaccination alone does <em>not</em> offer higher protection than previous Covid 19 infection alone.  </p>
<p>In fact, recent data from Israel suggests that the opposite is the truth: <strong>Previous infection alone offers 6.72 times the immunity as a full, double-jab Pfizer vaccination alone.</strong> (<a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/309762">Article</a>) (<a href="https://twitter.com/DavidLWindt/status/1416372911603134467">Short Video</a>) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiFuyMf6mmo">Full Video</a>)  </p>
<p>&rt; With a total of 835,792 Israelis known to have recovered from the virus, the 72 instances of reinfection amount to 0.0086% of people who were already infected with COVID.  </p>
<p>&rt; By contrast, Israelis who were vaccinated were 6.72 times more likely to get infected after the shot than after natural infection, with over 3,000 of the 5,193,499, or 0.0578%, of Israelis who were vaccinated getting infected in the latest wave.</p>
<p>If you actually read the CDC's press release and study, you will see why.  What they actually studied was <strong>only</strong> people who had been previously infected.  </p>
<p>&rt; [A] study of COVID-19 infections in Kentucky among people who were previously infected with SAR-CoV-2 shows that unvaccinated individuals are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with COVID-19 than those who were fully vaccinated after initially contracting the virus</p>
<p>The comparison was made between Previously Infected Without Vaccination to Previously Infected with Vaccination.  In that case, if you have already been infected, then you already have much more protection than vaccinated people, but yes, if you additionally get vaccinated, you will get even more protection.  </p>
<p>This is important information, but it is not what the title suggests.**</p>
