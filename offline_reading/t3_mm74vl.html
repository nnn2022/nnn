    <strong>2016, the 3rd leading cause of death was medical mistakes. 2020, the 3rd leading cause of death was.....Covid. I have a theory.</strong>
    <p><p>I know I keep harping on and praising Erin Olszewski's book, "Undercover Epicenter Nurse", but the stuff in this book is absolutely incredible. She said most of the people she saw dying were completely preventable. Here are just some of the things she writes about seeing:</p>
<ul>
<li>STUDENT OPTOMETRISTS and other specialists not trained in emergency care or contagious disease were running ventilators and performing other tasks without knowing what they were doing or being trained. Many of them didn't ask for help because they wanted to get practice and "play doctor".</li>
</ul>
<p>-9/10 people put on ventilators died. Ventilators were being used because of convenience instead of necessity. An unconscious patient won't press the button to have help going to the bathroom, etc. Sedation &amp; catheters were considered easier.</p>
<p>-People who were supposed to be resuscitated if their heart stopped were not. Family's didn't know. Some people were encouraged to sign DNR orders, even one's that were doing ok and we're somewhat young.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rooms were not being cleaned from patient to patient. Garbage cans overflowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Covid negative patients were put in the same room as Covid positive patients. People who were waiting for results for Covid tests were put with covid confirmed patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PPE wasn't being changed and was cross contaminating non-covid patients</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have heard that hospital mistakes are very high up on the statistics every year. In 2016, it was the 3rd leading cause of death (in the US). So after reading Erin's book, and hearing about the laxed hospital conditions because of exemptions made for Covid, and patients' family not being able to oversee everything, I'm thinking the medical mistakes had to be off the chart in 2020.  I couldn't really find anything regarding medical mistake stats for 2020 (probably because most of it is off record and not provable). After all, no family to witness+ no autopsy= no (reported) mistakes. I did come across an article that said Covid deaths ranked....  you guessed it, number 3 for 2020 (replacing medical mistakes for the number 3 spot). It's been said that Covid has cured the flu. Maybe covid has made medical mistakes disappear too.  I'm not saying that every death marked down as Covid is "medical murder". Some are legit. Some are heart attacks, flu, etc, as we already are well aware of.</p>
<p>So when someone tells you they take it personally that you aren't wearing a mask because they had a loved one die of COVID, the truth of the matter is they probably know very little about what happened to their family member (if they died in the hospital). None of us want to say that, including myself, because emotions are emotions and a lot of the time they are misdirected, not just regarding covid, but in general. </p>
<p>Side note: It's estimated that only 10% of less of vaccine injuries are reported. I bet it's the same way with medical mistakes. Unless medical staff actually admit to it, or it is proven in court, it's gonna get swept under the rug. Very rarely will medical staff tell on each other. Erin explained in her book, that when she tried to tell supervisors and other management, she was told to keep her head down and don't make waves. Even the staffing agency told her not to ruin a good opportunity (they were getting paid around 10k/ wk).</p></p>

        <p>Medical "mistakes". </p>
<p>These were not errors, friend. These people were killed to drive up the numbers, and stoke fear to the masses.</p>

        <p>She said she thinks that's what was happening. She had a few patients that she wouldn't leave their side because she believed they had a chance of making it. The higher ups wanted her out if the way so they pulled her to a different floor that was fully staffed just to get her away from these patients. She said as soon as she left, the vent settings were messed with and often she would hear a code through the speaker within 10 mins of her leaving their room (her patient dying).</p>

        <p>Agreed. Vents are considered highly skilled equipment even the average nurse has little to no knowledge on actually running the equipment. It's something you glance over in nursing school, but don't go in depth and after you likely wouldn't really see one depending on your specialty. </p>
<p>People on vents likely weren't cared the way they should've especially in the beginning when nurses were super scared of Covid. If you're not verbal there's a high chance nurses and aides might skip some of your care because there's no one to say anything. That's the sad side of healthcare that's always been there.</p>

        <p>Yep, that's what she said in the book about the vents. In a normal situation, hospitals aren't using vents at that rate. So everyone isn't super familiar with tons of knowledge and practice. There was someone in the hospital who was an expert but people wouldn't call her because they had a god complex and didn't want to ask for help. The air flow rate and all that isn't self explanatory and the consequences are almost always deadly for a screw up. They were also saying the tubes were dirty and not being changed out, things were being taped together. Sounds like a nightmare.</p>

        <p>Excellent post. I'm definitely going to read that book.  </p>
<p>Ventilators are used <strong>temporarily,</strong> during surgery. Ventilators are not a 'treatment'. </p>
<p>If doctors were truly trying to treat breathing difficulties, they would use non-invasive methods such as the <a href="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fd194giaj6npxqf.cloudfront.net%2Fwysiwyg%2Fproduct9%2F670260_2.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1">CPAP face mask</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that the muzzle/face mask was even more important for the conspirators than originally thought:</p>
<p>The more people they could coerce into wearing masks, the more people would develop breathing problems. If more people develop breathing problems, then more people can be put onto ventilators. </p>
<p>The BMJ (prominent medical journal here in the UK) published an <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n739">article</a> whining about all the 'abuse' that doctors have received during this period. </p>
<p>I suspect that many relatives of the deceased knew something was wrong, and tried to rescue their loved ones from the ICU wards...</p>
