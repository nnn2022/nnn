    <strong>"What Should Be Done To The Unvaccinated?"</strong>
    <p><p>If your answer is anything BUT "nothing" you're an authoritarian asshole complicit in segregation and the violation of basic human rights. If you're confident in your vaccine then you shouldn't even care about someone else's vaccination status. If you're not confident, why the fuck did you take it in the first place and why should I get it? You don't even know if yours will work, what makes you think mine will? </p>
<p>Time to start asking yourself some serious questions.</p></p>

        <p>Every now and again, I discuss this topic in other non-covid sub reddits. I find its actually a really good conversation to have with a hostile audience.</p>
<p>The reason is you don't have to disagree with them. Just keep asking questions.</p>
<p>&rt; Some people, rightly or wrongly <strong>will never</strong> take the vaccine. So What do we do with them?</p>
<p>Typical 1st person to reply says - "unvaccinated people are very bad people."</p>
<p>Very important to not argue or disagree with them. Just keep asking questions.</p>
<p>&rt; Right or wrong / Good or bad / whatever we think about the unvaccinated, these people <strong>will never</strong> take the vaccine. And we have to live with them. So how do we do that?</p>
<p>typical responses - </p>
<p>restrict them / ban them from certain activities / refuse them service / refuse them employment /</p>
<p>Don't argue, just keep asking questions...</p>
<p>ok - so how do we stop them interacting with society? </p>
<p>How do we enforce a system with two classes of citizens?</p>
<p>If we're restricting employment opportunities - how do they support themselves? </p>
<p>How can we manage an increase in crime that comes through poverty?</p>
<p>Do we need to increase policing?</p>
<p>The question of children - should unvaccinated have separate schools?</p>
<p>Can the unvaccinated have separate businesses?</p>
<p>Are they paying taxes for services they are not permitted to use?</p>
<p>Should they have their own representation in local government?</p>
<p>If the unvaccinated are spread across the country is it easier if they were relocated to certain areas?</p>
<p>When the British left India, their strategy to maintain peace was to  separate the country into two halves, India and Pakistan, primarily along religious lines, one group of people oppressing the other group.</p>
<p>What does your debating feel about this!?</p>
<p>Don't worry if the person you are talking with is a nazi, its the people reading your conversation who are the important ones. It takes very little time for anyone reading your exchange to realise who the insane person is.</p>

        <p>It's not reverse psychology; it's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method">Socratic method</a>, which is where you open a dialogue with questions to stimulate critical thinking.</p>
<p>Some people are "wise" to this, and view it as arguing in bad faith. Such people are only looking to argue to gain validation from their peers. They are not interested in an intellectual debate.</p>
<p>There are others who view asking the "wrong" questions as a defense of the opposition. Such people are tribalists. They are the people you need to worry about because they believe that supporting their tribe is more important than truth.</p>

        <p>Fundamentally arguing isn't a contest, but a search for the best answer. Once you grasp that and have an objective perspective on the subject it becomes quite easy, fun even </p>
<p>Especially confusing to some people is a volte face when one changes an opinion based on new information or interpretation, although it's a perfectly rational thing to do.</p>

        <p>I have a simple response to this, anyone who dosent take the vaccine, like any other human, should be treated like a human. No second class citizenship or whatever, just let them live their lives.
If they choose not to get the covid vaccine, let them. Those of us who choose to take it will try and carry heard immunity without them, like humans did for smallpox, polio, measles, ect.</p>

        <p>I just married. My wife, 28 and I would like to start having children. 
Would you recommend we get it? We are both fit and exercise daily. </p>
<p>Have you got a study that took someone who became pregnant after the vaccine, and went full term 9 months? And have we done studies a year later on the infant to determine if there were any adverse affects? Especially for the mother and any adverse affects during breastfeeding?</p>
<p>If it exist, I'm gonna need about 1-2 million people that were in the study. I'll need to know who paid for it as well. </p>

        <p>As I was saying before, these (except for the children vaccine claim) are all perfectly normal actions during a pandemic. I never saw anyone claim that children should be vaccinated without proper testing, and my 12 year old relative was unable to obtain a vaccine when his family went to get their shots.</p>
<p>Those guys also spend several years in medicine studying and have to take an extremely difficult exam to become certified. I dont really get the anti-intellectualism here.</p>

        <p>I will disagree with the "medical facism" claim.</p>
<p>Lockdowns were normal before vaccines. There were cases of people suing the Gov in 1918 over mask mandates. They lost and the government is not a fascist dictatorship run by doctors, merely a scam ring run by the pedophilic elite (Epstein did not kill himself). They are not the same.</p>
<p>I think the anti-vaccine movement is inherently parents wishing the best for their kids, but in the wrong way. The movement itself was started by a child abuser who made a claim in a study about a vaccine that was disproved before it was even published. I think most people who are against vaccines are misguided, not idiots. Disagree with me all you want, that is what I believe, and you are allowed to believe differently in America, and it should stay that way</p>
<p>Also, honor the fallen, have a good memorial day.</p>

        <p>I really don't give a shiti about what happened in 1918.  It's not just "lockdowns," it's private business closures and transfer of wealth to mega corporations, which are just an extension of the government.  Fascism.</p>
<p>Governments and corporations who and people who support vaccine passports are medical fascists.  The vaccine pass is just the first step.  They are tyrants who want to control every aspect of your life.</p>

        <p>Fuck megacorperations, fuck fascists, fuck the military industrial complex, and fuck tyrants trying to control the world. None of those are related to the vaccine. I pulled the example from 1918 to show this happened before, especially quarantines and lockdowns. We need to eat the rich, not because of vaccines, but because of how they treat everyone other than the rich. The virus is not part of that, just like the Spanish flu wasn't part of that either.</p>

        <p>Isn't there no conclusive evidence regarding vaccinations and transmission rates? Every source I've seen says "we're still learning about transmission rates but early results look promising. we still recommend keeping a safe distance", etc.</p>

        <p>I like bringing up institutional racism to people who support any kind of restriction on unvaccinated people.  Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to be vaccinated, so it is textbook institutional racism to punish unvaccinated people.  Make these people choose between freedom or racism.  You would be shocked at just how quickly they shut up because they don't want to admit which of those they would still choose.</p>

        <p>I’ve brought that fact up once before but group think is strong on reddit. Somalians have an incredibly low vaccination rate. To the point where government officials have tried outreach programs to boost their numbers, but with very little success. Their reasons to decline are interesting as well.</p>

        <p>This is much more likely to be fruitful than Socratic questioning in a social media type setting. The later is more intellectually sincere and overall positive toward thought. The racism talk is emotional garbage. But these people are into emotional garbage and tend to be intellectually challenged. It's not that they don't have to capacity to think; they just choose emotionalism as their religion and refuse to think. Sometimes you can make them think, but most of the time it's much easier to simply use their buzz words against them.</p>

        <p>I’m starting to have conversations with parents as our kids are now being asked to be “vaccinated “ it’s not required (yet) ... and I asked a parent who’s 12 year old (my kids in their class) about those who won’t do this...she mentioned “well it’s going to be required anyway, so...”</p>
<p>I’m like cool so... if I refuse do I get a tax refund? “No, silly statement ... you’re required to have vaccines anyway”.  I said yes, but this isn’t FDA approved ... she said”The unvaccinated kids will have to wear masks”. And I said “oh, will they also need to use separate water fountains?”</p>
<p>She ended the conversation.</p>

        <p>Fact is we have no way to know and people who care seem to be the anti vaxers.   Honestly the only people who have gotten the vaccine who care about anti vaxers are those with small children or elderly relatives who for some reason couldn't get the vaccine.    I got the vaccine and so did my entire family minus 2 who couldn't... so why TF would I care about those who didn't?   You made a choice and so did I.    As long as the virus doesn't mutate in some way that invalidates my vaccine you and I are good.    Honestly I think the anti vax people desperately want the rest of us to have an issue with your choices but honestly we don't care.    No one cares about you and your rebellion except for a few Karen's and some puffed up self important idiots on TV who no one cares about either.    Your choices are yours, no one cares what you do.    Stop trying to get attention for your little temper tantrum.    No one is checking vaccine cards if you don't have a mask, no one is going to take your birthday away.    This shit is pretty much over, everyone is going back to normal.   I know that the last year has made you feel special because you were a freedom fighter and a rebel but it's over.   Real like with work, bills and normal shit is back so enjoy the fact that this is over.</p>

        <p>After all of that... I hope the conversation comes back full circle to...1% death rate... similar to the flu. But nobody was ousted out of society for not taking the flu vaccine. Yes... I realize this virus is more contagious. But nonetheless... I wish critical thinking would make a comeback to our society. The Kool-Aid is full of saccharine.</p>

        <p>My point being that with your 1st question I would respond "nothing, why should we care... the majority are inoculated so the virus should only affect the unvaxed going forward"   I would follow that up with the fact that I do not think they should recieve any special treatment of they do get sick like supplemental pay or extra time of work with pay because they made their choices.   Other than that though... they made their choice and we made ours. Not to mention there is no way to prove they did or didn't get it and those little cards are super easy to fake so it's not like anyone could tell anyway.   It's pathetic to ask the 1st question honestly.   It's baiting.</p>

        <p>It's great that you can refute a series of straw men so eloquently.</p>
<p>No one's getting rid of your body autonomy and forcing you to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Social engineering is an aspect of your life whether you want to accept it or not. </p>
<p>We have fines in place for littering, loitering, and even in some states sleeping outside on public property. </p>
<p>I don't see you guys up in arms about these laws which are designed to encourage certain behavior / clean up the streets of the homeless.</p>
<p>A intimate system of carrots and sticks is already in place. We're just adding a few more carrots and sticks to reach heard immunity levels of immunization.</p>
<p>No one is going to herd you into camps or force you to get vaccinated or treat you like second class citizens.</p>
<p>People are just going to look down on you for your solipsistic and uneducated world view, and your life will be more difficult becuase of the choice you made. </p>
<p>But anyone that chooses to go against social norms suffers difficulties.</p>
<p>Your constant moral outrage over an imagined future that I've seen plenty liken to the gulags of the Soviet Era or your claims that vaccine cards are like the yellow badges of Nazi Germany is laughable.</p>

&rt; 
&rt; No one is going to herd you into camps or force you to get vaccinated or treat you like second class citizens.</p>
<p>Well, herding into camps is exaggeration, of course, but treating like second class citizens is a genuine concern. How many carrots and sticks can you add before it becomes a two-class system?</p>
<p>And besides, sorry to disappoint you, but the goal you stated (herd immunity) <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00728-2">is unachievable</a>.</p>
<p>&rt; But anyone that chooses to go against social norms suffers difficulties.</p>
<p>There are two nuances to that. First - not all difficulties are equally acceptable; for example, if I'm ok with a murderer facing such difficulties as being made to stay in a prison for a certain time, it doesn't mean that I view imprisonment as an acceptable punishment for anyone going against any social norms in general. And second - in this specific case, everyone will face difficulties, not just anti-vaxers. Right now in Germany, some establishments are (finally) opening for those who are either vaccinated, recovered, or have a daily test. As the number of vaccinations rises, such a policy will become easier to implement, so probably more and more businesses will do it. So you're going to show your vaccination card ten times a day on every corner (and you're not the only one who wants to enter, so please stand in line each and every time); and god forbid if you ever forget it at home or lose it - you won't be admitted anywhere, except for a test station. And if you miss an appointment for your booster shot, you're exempt from society until you get it. Better book the next shot right after you got this one, just in case there won't be free slots later. And that's not even touching the subject of the possibility for vaccinated people to transmit the virus, maybe you'll have your vaccination card AND daily tests.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm personally not anti-vax at all (though I'm probably not going to get a vaccine any time soon because I'm not in a priority group, there are just no free slots here). I just don't like the prospect of living in a world where vaccination passports are mandatory, even if I have one.</p>

        <p>Your philosophy is self-defeating I'm not getting vaccinated becuase not enough people are getting vaccinated. The tautology  is legitimately frustrating. </p>
<p><a href="the literature is always advancing.">https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/pmc/articles/PMC8102074/</a> Your editorial from a couple months prior is an interesting dissenting opinion, but I implore you to broaden your horizons. The editorial you cited also still called for people to recieve their vaccinations.</p>
<p>The paper I cite shoes that variants of concern are becoming an increasing cause for alarm and vaccinations to minimize spread of the virus is an important way of mitigating this problem.</p>
<p>And while I agree that there are degrees of incentivization and disincentivization that are out of line. I have yet to see any policy enacted that is more concerning than a potential resurgence of this virus.</p>
<p>Vaccine passports to limit international travel to and from countries is very reasonable to me. I dont think you can argue that international travel is a human right. </p>
<p>We already require vaccinations for public schooling, and I believe private businesses should be allowed to make their own policies as they see fit.</p>
<p>Am I just missing something here that is setting off so many alarm bells for people in this sub? It's a legitimate question</p>

        <p>There is still a chance to get covid even when vaccinated, which is why it is important for everyone to get vaccinated, because then the chance that one gets it is low, and then the chance they pass it on is also low, making the odds zero. </p>
<p>People have been enforcing wearing masks, like not being allowed in stores, remember that whole shit show? You literally went back to my original comment, where I insulted anti vaxxers for only caring about themselves, no-one is going to implement the policy, but those who do not follow such easy guidelines are assholes, which is my original comment if you remember. Is there really a second class if you are choosing to be in it, you can leave it at any point without any issues, so you are the one putting yourself in it. </p>
<p>As someone who goes to school I can confirm that anti maskers are being segregated, by not being allowed to enter, because they put other children and families in danger. How do you not understand how far a single infected person can spread covid. Here's an example: one person goes to school and doesnt wear a mask, which infects 4 others, and those kids go home, infect their parents, who then infect their friends, all in the first two weeks. Masks have been proven to be extremely useful in schools, as I had personally had people in my grade have covid, who went home and recovered, but guess what, no-one else was, because everyone was wearing masks.</p>

        <p>Vaccinated individuals can still have asymptomatic infections too. What’s the difference between a vaccinated asymptomatic person and a non-vaccinated asymptomatic person transmission-wise? The majority of the at-risk population has been vaccinated at this point (at least in the US), as evidenced by death and infection rates plummeting. Why should we continue with mandates and restrictions?</p>

        <p>Because vaccines aren't one hundred percent, here is one of my previous comments that explains it:</p>
<p>They operate on a large part through herd mentality. Here is an example with much higher odds as it is easier. Lets say if you do not get vaccinated you have a 50% chance of getting infected, then you give another person a 50% chance, meaning they have a 50% of a 50% to be infected, leaving them with a 25% chance to be infected. If you get vaccinated lets say you have a 10% chance of being infected and then you have a 10% chance to pass it on to someone else, meaning that someone has a 1% chance of being infected. By the time you have already gotten over covid it may have been passed on further if the person was not vaccinated. This is why vaccines work most effectively when a lot of people are vaccinated, and even one non vaccinated person may cause a risk to others.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So yes, they are endangering everyone</p>

        <p>drugs, okay pal, it is just a vaccine, like any other, scientists would not allow the public to take them if they were dangerous. I care about others by wearing a mask, because I am not able to get a vaccine, and when I do I will continue to wear a mask, to be the most safe possible, it is a small inconvenience so there is no reason not to. Therefore, anyone who wears a mask or gets vaccinated cares about others at least a very little, or just a lot about themselves.</p>

        <p>I have yet to take the vaccine, just so you know it didn't brainwash me or anything, but I will soon. Meat is not a popular trend, in fact right now I'd say it is more trendy when you switch to veganism or whatever. Though people do not do it because it doesn't make any health risks to eat meat.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of electric, but it is not viable currently for economic reasons.</p>
<p>Of course I use Chinese products and smartphones, who doesn't? You can't get around them, they are literally everywhere.</p>
<p>Wearing a mask protects those around you, as it stops you from sending covid meters from where you are and spreading it to others. This is a basic level of caring about others, by mildly inconveniencing yourself you are potentially stopping someone from dying, so yes I would say that is caring about others.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT: I have done animal shelter work through my school for 3 years, having stopped 2 years ago, you just assume I don't care? I help others when they ask, who wouldn't? Maybe someone not wearing their mask</p>

<p>It's not just mine, its a couple billion, and yes, I do suck. I don't care that they will die because I do not know them personally, same as how you would not care if I dropped dead, since you do not know me.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>You're damn right I exploit slave labor. I ALSO don't LIE ALL DAY TO EVERYONE and pretend like I care about everyone. YOU DO.</p>
<p>I never said I cared about everyone, I said I will not endanger people over the slightest inconvenience (masks, I wear them because they do not harm me, and instead save lives). I can not stress enough how much I do not lie saying that I care about everyone, as I have not said that. But if I can stop someone from dying by wearing a piece of cloth over my mouth you bet your ass I will, it's not caring, it's simple humanity (im guessing you will use this to say how caring about those other people is also simple humanity, no it's not, that's different because this does not hurt me, stopping meat consumption can, humans are omnivores, we were made to eat meat and so I will). Also you started the whole shit about slave labour, I just stated that I do benefit from it, whether I like it or not, since I can't stop it</p>

<p>I don't care if I catch it since it's no big deal. If people are afraid of my free face, then can put a fucking N95 on.</p>
<p>Its not a big deal for you, but if you catch it you can pass it to other, who pass it to others, who pass it to others and someone will eventually die from it. Me putting on a mask will not change my chances as drastically as you think, since Covid can get to me through other ways, and so if you don't wear it then you can still spew covid particles my way, reaching me and infecting me. You showing me that you are willing to put others in danger over a simple mask that you can hardly notice tells me a lot about you.</p>

        <p>Not exactly, meat is important to humans, we are omnivores after all. Masks are a tiny inconvenience amd can save lives, so not wearing one is a much bigger dick move than eating meat</p>

        <p>Many of the anti maskers have used me being 16 as an excuse to call me not fully developed, yet i am able to understamd how the small inconvenience benefits LITERALLY EVERYONE. While you are throwing the tantrums over these small pieces of cloth, how weak do you have to be not be able to wear a mask? Or is it that you decide that it is not for you? Because of governmemt control im guessing? Or just because "you cant breathe", which is so clearly a lie. Im nit an altruist, i know how i am benefiting of of the exploitations of others, but i also know that there is no reason that an "adult" (yes i put quotations since you clearly dont act like one) should ever be crying about a mask, seriously it is so pathetic to see.</p>

        <p>It is useful, as you breathing out can send covid particles numerous meters if you are infected, while the mask stops it.</p>
<p>It "inconveniences" you, lmao, you are putting lives in danger because it inconveniences you, that is just great. Give my best of luck wishes to your toddler, it will need all it can get with someone like you as their mother.</p>
<p>It doesnt kill the environment, i dont see why you keep saying it, there are thousands of other issues, and you choose the smallest one which also has the greatest benefit, nice one, why dont you go yell at the cars driving down the road or the meat industry if you care so much about the environment.</p>
<p>Again with the unformed brain crap, here you are crying about a mask and putting lives in danger because it inconveniences you. It was your choice to get pregnant during covid, so why are you deciding everyone else should be put at risk because you decided this was the perfect time to fuck without a condom. I love the insults about being a child, it seems to be that and face trash as the only things you can think off.</p>
<p>If you dont want to wear a mask, maybe get vaccinated, or just dont go outside until you had the baby so you can wear the mask like a normal person of society.</p>
<p>Just say you are a selfish cunt and stop trying to justify it, im not trying to justify my child labour phone, i know kids slaved over it in some asian country so why cant you just say that you are weaker than a 16 year old and a piece of cloth is enough to mildly inconvenience you to a point of putting others in danger instead of just, ya know, staying inside.</p>

The conditions are brutal for both the animals and the workers and many of the workers are underpaid illegal immigrants.

<p>Person A: They believe that masks and social distancing work because the government have imposed these rules. They have symptoms, but think it doesn't matter as they are wearing a mask. While sick, they go to the supermarket to buy groceries for their grandparents, then visit them at their home. They spend time at their grandparents' house while delivering the groceries. Their grandparents wear masks in their home while their grandchild is there. Person A also wears their mask and follows social distancing rules at all times. </p>
<p>Person B: They had pre-existing knowledge about face masks and believe that masks do not work. If they are ever sick, they stay at home. When they are aren't sick, they live their life like normal and don't wear a mask or follow social distancing rules when in public. </p>

        <p>I like how you are presenting the mask person as an asshole, if they go out when they know they are sick they are an asshole, but of course they will stay at home, just like the anti masker in your situation. But the thing is covid has an average of 2 weeks where it can be transferred but not show symptoms, which is why you wear the mask, it is a precaution, because you can't know if you have it unless you get tested. </p>
<p>Here is me flipping around the roles to show how stupid what you said was:</p>
<p>The anti masker knows they are sick, but go outside anyways</p>
<p>The person who wears a mask stays inside even when they arent sick as a precaution, because they aren't stupid and know they can't know whether or not they are infected.</p>

<p>Person A in the scenario is not an arsehole. They are behaving that way because they genuinely believe that nobody can get sick if they wear a mask. </p>

        <p>Masks are not a hundred percent, just like vaccines, but they heavily lower the chances. That person is very much an ass, as he is putting others in danger, and you saying he isn't is telling me that you think masks are 100%, which they are not, nothing in the world is. Person B is an ass too, because he believes that because there are no symptoms that he is not sick, which is wrong too.</p>

        <p>those*, sorry for two small spelling mistakes, I have been replying to like 50 comments. I am fine and have yet to be vaccinated, as I have not gotten the chance yet. Half tested is such a stupid claim, the vaccine has been tested for a long time before it was released, and scientists wouldn't release trash that is killing everyone.</p>

        <p>so you are going to sit here and tell me that when you said half tested you are not talking about the vaccine? I have answered to more than enough comments on this one post alone to know that is exactly what you mean. Also just because it is a question does not mean it does not include a claim. Here is an example: Have you taken any drugs lately you fucking addict? I did not say it, but I did imply that if you are taking drugs you are an addict. I am heavily implying it, even if I did not state it.</p>
<p>But anyways, tell me what you meant by half tested, if it is not the vaccine</p>

        <p>I wonder if any of you weirdos ever stopped to think that there's nothing you can do to stop yourselves from getting sick. It's a completely pointless exercise to worry about one possible source of infection, because one day out of the blue you might touch the wrong doorknob and it will put you in more danger than all the unvaccinated people in the whole world.</p>

        <p>Vaccines significantly lower the chance of getting infected, they don't make it zero. They operate on a large part through herd mentality. Here is an example with much higher odds as it is easier. Lets say if you do not get vaccinated you have a 50% chance of getting infected, then you give another person a 50% chance, meaning they have a 50% of a 50% to be infected, leaving them with a 25% chance to be infected. If you get vaccinated lets say you have a 10% chance of being infected and then you have a 10% chance to pass it on to someone else, meaning that someone has a 1% chance of being infected. By the time you have already gotten over covid it may have been passed on further if the person was not vaccinated. This is why vaccines work most effectively when a lot of people are vaccinated, and even one non vaccinated person may cause a risk to others</p>

        <p>That's why I'm hoping for a peaceful divorce rather than a violent civil war. With the direction I see America going I cant see any third option. The opposing sides are just getting further apart with each day. If the federal government would just back the f off and let the states govern themselves like it was supposed to be than we would all be fine. Dont like how one state is ran? Just move to a different state.</p>

        <p>A totalitarian society, be it medical or political, is anything but safe or healthy.  </p>
<p>Your last paragraph is written in an oddly projective way. Seek help.  </p>
<p>You don't get to force what contributions to society another person makes. You do not get to determine what is or is not selfish for another person. You are not the arbiter of what is or is not a conspiracy. You are not qualified to make a psychological diagnosis of a person online without consent and procedures/certifications to do so. You are not exempt from the act of 'spreading disease' just because you are vaccinated - it is not magic - you can still spread disease after vaccination. (there are other diseases, too, you know)  </p>
<p>Just because someone thinks differently than you does not mean they are *not* critically thinking or *not* empathetic. In your last line of your narcissistic diatribe, you admit to your own failing to see that others **indeed** have different opinions, but yours is the **right** one. Total fundamentalist behavior. Seriously seek help.  </p>

        <p>I wonder how some smarty lawyer will use this to start pushing to trial minors as adults in the court systems when it comes to assault/murder charges? They may not be old enough to drive, to drink, to sign themselves out of school, but old enough to be mature to get the “jab” hey, they’re old enough to be responsible for their actions then. </p>
<p>And if what I heard was true, they didn’t even need to have a health card on them to get the “jab” at Toronto’s Nathan Phillips center where it was going on. So no formal tracking of who/if they got it..</p>

        <p>Clarence Thomas, of the US Supreme Court, has pointed out how the leftist are inconsistent with their labeling of minors: </p>
<p>"When addressing juvenile murderers, this Court has stated that 'children are different' and that courts must consider 'a child's lesser culpability.'"</p>
<p>"And yet, when assessing the Court-created right of an individual of the same age to seek an abortion, Members of this Court take pains to emphasize a 'young woman's right to choose,'" Thomas wrote.</p>
<p>"It is curious how this Court's view of the maturity of minors ebbs and flows depending on the issue," </p>

        <p>Right. And in the US, a male must register with Selective Service as soon as he turns 18, but that same young man can't have a beer or a cigarette until he turns 21. I don't condone smoking, but it is a legal activity and one can choose to smoke or not. One can choose to drink, or not. But they can't choose to not sign up for Selective Service, where he could potentially be sent into the military to fight in a war, where he could be killed or maimed. If he's maimed at 19 or 20, he can't have a beer, and under federal law, he can't smoke a joint... even though there are NO recorded deaths caused by marijuana overdose, but he can have highly addictive opiates prescribed to him even though opiate overdoses kill thousands every single year.</p>

        <p>This is international and often about gender.</p>
<p>Example from Sweden. A young man who raped a minor, he was 17 and she was 15 (legal for voluntary sex) is described as a boy. A group of females aged 15-16 beats a slightly younger girl, described as young women.</p>
<p>A young woman is any female over 15 and males are boys until around 20 even if they are legally adults at 18. Unless it's one of the other 13 genders. Sigh.</p>

        <p>Just going to drop the opinion of a friend here:</p>
<p>She supports the vaccine passports, but only for international travel. She believes that those who refuse to be injected should never be allowed to leave the country as international travel is a privilege and not a right. She doesn't think that any additional restrictions should be placed on us. </p>
<p>I asked her if she thought that people who are abroad and unable to return to their home country should be banned from ever going home to their families if they don't want the injection. She refused to answer. She has previously admitted that it is disgusting that there are people who have been trapped abroad for over a year, unable to return home due to the restrictions. So she obviously knows that this is wrong but cannot admit it. </p>
<p>I then asked how she felt about the people who are unable to be injected for medical or religious reasons and if she felt that these people should also never be allowed to travel abroad. Again, she refused to answer.</p>

        <p>Cut them out of your life. No seriously.</p>
<p>If your friend is an authoritarian, and believes some of your actions should be criminalized, that means they support the chance you may be killed by resisting tyranny.</p>
<p>We'll take the vaccine as an example. If your friend supports mandatory vaccinations to participate in society, no exceptions, no questions asked, they are essentially supporting ostracizing you and your family.</p>
<p>Guns is another good one. If they believe guns should be banned and taken from gun owners they support turning you into a felon.</p>
<p>I do not associate with people who do not share similar beliefs.</p>

        <p>I disagree with this advice. Some people haven’t had enough real world experience to differentiate between fact and fiction from the MSM. They might not be bad people at heart but propaganda is powerful. Extremely powerful. Cutting people out with differing beliefs, even if they are wrong in your opinion, closes possible learning opportunities.</p>

        <p>Thanks for the reply, I agree that the cat's out of the bag and it's not going back in.  But they see themselves as empathetic and humanitarian because they wear a mask, get vaccinated, etc.  It's people who don't do that who are selfish and don't care about others (they say).  I'll keep trying, though. I might have gotten through to one of them a little on the censorship issue.</p>

<p>Thats basically the core issue here. Some people believe there should be an institution that regulates the lifes of others. Some disagree.</p>
<p>Ill never understand why people want to be ruled. I sincerely dont. Like I know some of those people and obviously they lack self-confidence, trust into the natur / universe / god / whatever and fear death.</p>
<p>But, all you gotta do is read some history books and youll quickly come to realise why it might not be a good idea to submit to the ruling of others.</p>

They feel safe in the hands of a strong force and they'll gladly give their freedom for protection, there's an entire movement going on about how safety matters and all but if you look closely you'll notice that the requirement for this "safety" is giving up more and more freedom.</p>

        <p>Well maybe in near future when more adverse  serious side effects and even deaths can be unambiguously linked to the Pfizer and Moderna, etc. Shots..public opinion /pressure may change . One has to use uncensored browsers it seems to find data that doesn't follow the govt position.  I wasn't following the data zealously.... I only recently discovered that late last year CDC  themselves acknowledged at that point only 6%of covid19 attributed deaths had only covid19 as the SOLE medical condition .Every other death attributed to Covid19 had other preexisting medical conditions.</p>

        <p>They need to leave us alone. I get afraid of FEMA camps being in our future. You know things are screwed when you are having midnight conversations with your husband, about what should we do, if they make this stuff mandatory and knowing that the chances of immediate death from the vaxx is very high due to intense medical conditions. The Nazis who want to round us up or punish us for making the choice to NOT take a non-safe or effective vaxx, disgust me. I'm keeping my mouth shut now.....not telling anyone anything IRL, lost so many "friends" and know most would turn on me if I talked about this. Husband had to put off someone asking if we got the vaxx even recently.</p>

        <p>Honestly why dig our whole deeper by lying. I'm always honest to people about my opinion on this whole topic.
That way I want show that there are alternatives and it's okay and normal to, let's say, not get the covid vaccine or wanting the restrictions gone unconditionally.
I have the feeling that many people feel social pressure and almost make a competition out of who is getting the vaccine first. That's why I believe it's important to show people, who are afraid to voice their doubts openly, that they are not alone.</p>

        <p>I feel you completely here. Never once thought as a kid that I’d be having late night conversations with friends about escaping mandatory vaccinations, or sneaking into a speakeasy gym and speakeasy bar just for a quick workout or drink with a select few buddies to talk about things. </p>
<p>The big topic on my new group’s mind is getting fake vaccine passports to secure our future. The majority of our group is actually expats in a foreign country. Not too worried about the speakeasy gym- $1,000 should handle it in my country and I’m off without it being logged. </p>
<p>Never ever ever thought I’d live in a nazi-like world, but instead of a nazi state it’s basically the entire world!!! </p>
<p>I don’t know what to make of it. I often feel lost, confused, depressed. Not being able to chill at a bar with friends without opening our local speakeasy and being sketched out is driving me crazy. Having to crawl into a secret entrance for a gym is crazy. </p>
<p>It was clear then but even more so now this was about control not about the virus.</p>

        <p>...and what is the whole gaslighting about the only way to get herd immunity is through vaccinations. This turns a century of science on its head and the rewrites whole field of immunology. They are even advising those who have recovered from Covid to go get the jab as if the gene therapy made of just the spike protein is somehow superior. It is a well known fact that the exposure to whole virus results in robust immunity that most likely lasts a lifetime. Forget about the innate immunity via T-cells and mucosal immunity which are first line of defense against respiratory viruses. They pretend as if the whole of humanity has ZERO immunity and we are just machines and software and the only way to be protected is to take the experimental jab with absolutely no long-term safety record and news coming out every day about the dangerous side effects. They are pushing it on kids who are statistically at zero risk and putting them at a much greater risk from the jab itself. This shows their utter disregard and contempt for humanity. Can't wait for these criminals to be dragged in front of an international court for violating the Nuremberg code.</p>

<p>You can't honestly think that my reply was anything but making fun of you, can you? Yet you reply as if I was serious. Nothing you said in your comment above mine was helpful to your cause and I wanted to help point that out to you, using your methods, only from a stupider vantage point. I fear that, with the current distance restrictions still in place, I won't be able to get close enough to hold your hand throughout that process.  </p>

        <p>You're right it's my bad that I didn't take your openly hostile sarcastic remarks for an attempted olive branch. Oh how I've seen the error of my ways. How can we continue our discourse if I don't spend the time and academic rigor to point by point refute your bullshit that takes literally zero effort on your part to spew.</p>
<p>It's so amazing how fast you've moved this conversation to the epistemological and how I'm talking,  rather than the science behind your anti-vaccination beliefs.</p>
<p>It's abhorrent to you that someone actually does know better and has an understanding of the science that you are willfully ignorant of. You don't have a leg to stand on so you recapitulate empty platitudes of a meta-argument that doesn't address the fiction you spouted earlier that shows you fundamentally don't understand how the human body works or the mechanism of action of the vaccine you detest so vehemently.</p>
<p>You accuse me of existing in a fantasy world and asigning you an archetype that fits my own internal narrative to dismiss you outright, yet in doing this you do the same.</p>
<p>&rt;you appear to be in a fantasy world where everyone who disagrees with you is lumped together as the same archetypal person that you despise</p>
<p>Here you've just assigned me an archetype to dismiss me outright. You don't know me.</p>
<p>You "lament"  there is no opportunity for discourse due to the way I phrase things. However you sit there and brazenly spread disinformation. </p>
<p>That is why we can't just talk about this like two people. That's where the breakdown in communication is.</p>

        <p>You are being downvoted. You have a negative audience. Please read between the lines and develop self-awareness that, in truth, I am trying to help you in your application of your messaging to people who aren't you. Get out of your echo chamber and try to reach me and those you are communicating with. Otherwise you will likely develop a form of dementia in the future due to the lack of proper online socialization. I am a proverbial U-turn sign with a proverbial deep ditch behind me that noticed a proverbial car coming towards me and I started flashing proverbial 'lights' at you to slow down.</p>
<p>I was playing with you, then serious, then playing, now serious. Which do you want? You are mechanically answering me without engaging with me. So I mechanically answer you without engaging you. I haven't stated my beliefs, to you, at all. When you put words in people's mouths, they will react accordingly negatively. Hostility meets hostility. I couldn't give less of a shit about the memes. No one is here for me. This is just me and you.</p>

        <p>You are lost in abstraction right now. Blissfully wrestling with your relationship to the absolute. You must have a point to make but you are writhing around in the logic of the words rather than the goals that these weightless volleys made with the person with whom you're dealing with could ever dream to ascribe.  </p>
<p>You will never find a better conversation than this one, mate.  </p>
<p>I never said you weren't welcome. You just were barking at the first person with literally no content or facts then saying something like: "boo hoo you won't deal with facts set before you". You aren't arguing. You're basking in technicalities that are immaterial to the original problem that I was making fun of you for.  </p>
<p>You might be smart, but you're not proving it whatsoever. You don't need to, but, why not make your point clearer to be more convincing if your opinions are so diametrically opposed to the environment you've chosen to engage with. Or at least give it a try.</p>

<p>Nah, you just have an idea of me in your head that I'm going to disassemble. No nerve struck, just haven't been on reddit in like 4 years and am getting back into the swing of things with someone who is clearly not making a genuine connection with the people they're trying to engage with.</p>
<p>&rt;This guy: Why can't you carry a conversation?<br>

&rt;Also this guy: I'm alternating between dicking around and having a "serious conversation".</p>
<p>Who are you talking to here? Me? Yourself? A perceived audience?</p>
<p>&rt;I don't understand?<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Are we having a conversation or dicking around</p>
<p>I reconstituted my position of the altercation to point out my mode of communication since I perceived that you weren't on board with anything but painfully logical (and inaccurate/ineffective) speech.</p>
<p>&rt;Is it me and you or am I not playing to an audience correctly</p>
<p>I think it's you. But it could also be me. The difference being that I am able to admit it and move on with the conversation instead of acting so insulted. Join me in not being insulted.</p>
<p>&rt;I need to get out of my echochamber, but I'm not welcome here in a community with ideas disparate from my own.</p>
<p>You do. But here you are mincing my words together to form a counter-narrative that is deceptively coy or just ignorant of the point I was making. You are not-not welcome here, you just don't seem to want to play nice and were brow-beating someone with literally nothing but assertions.</p>
<p>&rt;I think you may have lost the plot, but that's okay I've been having more productive conversations here. With people that aren't clowns.</p>
<p>Doubt it. Still, this sentence, as well as most of the others you've sent my direction, are nowhere near breaking out of your inner-dialog with the me you think I am and not registering with the I that is speaking with you. Every word I type right at this moment is for you. Your words vacillate between being aimed at me, you and some 3rd person ideal which I can't quite place.</p>
<p>All of this alludes to the fact that you may be unhinged enough to not be taken seriously about vaccines or immunology until you are willing to treat others as people and not concepts/statistics.</p>

        <p>I did not say T cells were innate immune system. I said Innate immunity via T cells. CD8 T cells are activated by Dendritic cells (innate immunity) which have taken up the viral antigen. This is a robust, critical, primary response to respiratory pathogens and Sars-Cov2 is one. Antibodies play a role but they are secondary and mucosal antibody response to respiratory infections are not long lasting.</p>

        <p>Based on the life expectancy calculated nowadays.
When the 80+ year olds, who are dying now, were born in the 30s, their life expectancy was not 80 yo, it was less than that.</p>
<p>"Life expectancy in Canada has greatly improved since the early 20th century. The life expectancy at birth for men has increased by 20.5 years, from 58.8 years in 1920–1922 to 79.3 years in 2009–2011. During the same period, the life expectancy of women increased by 23.0 years, from 60.6 years to 83.6 years."</p>

        <p>the problem here is that they are way too far gone already.<br>
they believe, and I mean truely believe, that the vaccine is the only way to end this pandemic.<br>
they are so caught in this thought process that they see no other solution. its either do what the government says or its not ending.</p>
<p>it a clever trick.<br>
you now have an overzealous group of your population that demonizes anyone who does not comply.<br>
the no-compliant group can take all the blame. the government can impose even more rules and still, the non-compliant group will take the blame for it.</p>
<p>rational people would see how any rule that is still in place is only in place because of the government.<br>
its that simple.<br>
each and every government could do away with all the COVID related rules and laws in a heartbeat.<br>
no vaccination necessary.</p>
<p>its such a simple truth and yet, they can't see it anymore.</p>
<p>the government is locking you up. the government is imposing rules on you. <strong>NO ONE ELSE</strong>.<br>
your fellow citizens, compliant or not, are not your enemy.<br>
project your anger and frustration at the right faction.</p>

        <p>That's the problem, they are manipulated to believe that the reason this pandemic is continuing is their "antivax" neighbor, or because people are walking down the street without a mask on. They truly believe they're projecting their anger at the right faction when they're encouraging employers to mandate the vaccine, because people who believe in freedom of medical choice are sold as the enemy by the media. I can't imagine this not getting ugly down the road, I just hope we're not as far gone as we may think.</p>

        <p>Ironically, r/offmychest auto-bans anyone for simply commenting here. You know, the sub where people are supposed to be able to go to... get things off their chest... </p>
<p>For someone who appreciates looking at dialogs from all sides so that I can then come up with something that makes sense for me and make a genuine attempt to be educated on whatever it is that I am researching, seeing that kind of blanket intolerance and censorship when I got the notification myself was terrifying to me. If you’re secure in your beliefs and your reasoning is sound, you should have no fear in people asking questions, in fact, you would encourage it! God forbid someone should research the alternative and engage with people who might think differently. Having that happen to me just the other day was eye opening to say the least. </p>
<p>It’s a shame that you, I, and so many others often feel afraid to engage in conversations for fear of the inevitable, and very real repercussions that follow. How can anyone ever expect to fix ANY major issue if honest conversations aren’t allowed to be had? I know that this type of overly emotional response is almost always the result of an insecurity within one’s own beliefs, but unfortunately this type of response now seems to be a totally acceptable norm, where acting that way before used to be seen as a sign of mental instability. It’s crazy to me.</p>

        <p>Ye, good luck with that. There's indigenous tribes in the amazon getting butchered by loggers and every bit of land is owned by someone-or some state. There is no part of this planet that is free, none. Riding off into the sunset on some pipedream utopia in the wilderness is a joke. 99.99 percent of the worlds population are not capable of living off the grid for any length of time. Go into the Aussie, American or Canadian bush is not a long term solution to being taken for a tyrannical ride. The vast majority will end up dead doing that, especially if they're alone. Communities are needed and then they'll need to defend what little community they have with force. A force that has toppled every major power it's felt like in any given strategic plan. It's a joke, whole state needs to be taken and the leaders arrested and tried for their crimes. Canada has suspended elections apparently due to it being 'irresponsible' to have one during a pandemic. Aye? This is where we're at. They're all going for this one world government in tandem and singing of a hymn sheet.</p>

        <p>I openly say let them go unvacced, if you think they are a risk then keep your mask up and stay away. . . If you think they are just going to spread it and kill themselves and other unvacced then in your own book that's a win win. . . If you feel the shot will protect you then you shouldn't care or worry. </p>
<p>My ex and my self both got cov, and we were lucky she was sick for about 2 days and I was completely asymptomatic, she later had to get the shot due to work and was sick as hell for about two weeks. . . She ended up getting covid again anyway, this seemed to be the theme at the nursing home where she worked. Over 95% of the staff and residents tested positive before getting the vaccine most of the cases were asymptomatic, quite a few of the nurses got worse after getting the shot for brief amount of time then they did raw dogging it.</p>

        <p>I understand where some confusion comes from with bubbles of hive mind conspiracy jerkoff circles and media mania fear-mongering, but my false positive bulshit lead to antibodies that you can find in a basic lab kit blood tests so please don't confuse your narrative with mine. I'm not telling you to get vaccinated or not because of me, I don't care. I personally chose not to because I didn't see the point in getting vaccinated for something I already caught. Call me a monster I don't plan on getting the flu shot either. I've got the flu three times in my life and it sucked but I'm not really at risk so I'm not going to go out of my way to get it. One of the few times I did I got the flu anyway. I'm not saying vaccines don't work I actually am very provax just not so much these vax.  . . Even if the risks are low we know what the risks are if we choose not to take it. We have no clue what does happen after we take it, due to the two extremes as mentioned before the conspiracy hive mind circle jerkers, or media fear-mongers. But since I can't trust either one of those I have to go by what I do know and that's family friends and coworkers.</p>

        <p>See you’re critical of media and conspiracy circle jerks but yet you still seem to fall in line with dogmatic thinking of choosing what information to trust and what to avoid. So you have antibodies from a fallible system in every sense of what science ever meant to explore. This recent statement from the FDA should speak for itself to anyone with a fraction of rationality and deductive reasoning to ignore absolutely everything the science involved with everything covid 19. Relative truth defines this whole scam. My question is, why still feed the beast? A year and a half later no explanation other than NO is necessary. People don’t want to let go of this psychosis on either side.</p>

        <p>If it comes down to information I personally choose to believe or discard it's quite easy, from the media and the president speaking I can kick out how billions of Americans are dying every single day, if that was the case we would have ran out of people long time ago. . . Can't rely on dr. Fauci the World Health Organization or the CDC because each one of them has changed protocols at least 10 times if they could agree on anything or wouldn't change their stance every 20 minutes it might be different so I disregard majority of what they say, and when it comes to the conspiracy theorists saying how it's a government plot using 5G Wireless high-speed internet and cell phone towers just to get you to go in to get computer chips injected into your bloodstream and how it's all made up illness for profit and money for free shots I threw that out too. . .  But yes when it comes down to our human body it's best to look at the human body to figure out what's wrong no matter how fallible it is. </p>
<p>When it comes to Common Sense things like wipe your ass wash your hands and don't cough or sneeze on people it kind of just explains itself. Is it perfect, nope but it's better than knowing you've been shot and instead of going to the hospital just smearing anti 5g lotion on the wound assuming I was shot because of racism and how oppressed I must be or how the Illuminati paid the guy to shoot me because the government wants me dead due to global warming.</p>

        <p>I don’t mean this as an insult in any way. Just trying to bring some rationality back. I feel people forgot things like colds, common immune system reactions from being worn down exist. </p>
<p>It can’t be the argument of pcr test are mostly false positives and I had covid for a day. I was fine. The whole asymptomatic is just more added psychosis. </p>
<p>We need to be rational and not conform to this stupidity on any level. If covid is so bad like they say, people will know when they have it. Colds,allergies, sinus infections, streptococcus, flu didn’t go anywhere as much as people want us to believe everything is now covid because they use a testing system that’s easy to manipulate</p>

        <p>I agree nothing should be done with the unvaccinated. The data collected so far shows that the vaccinated have little to nothing to worry about from the unvaccinated. The only people that are left out to dry here are the ones that can’t take the vaccine for health related reasons and also are high risk for getting fucked by the virus itself because of the same health related reasons.</p>

        <p>&rt; What should be done about the unvaccinated?</p>
<p>Nothing. The vaccines are available for anyone who wants one. They have been paid for by our taxes so there is zero cost at the time. The only excuse for not getting one is "I don't want one" and that's it. People can make their own choices; that's the benefits of being an adult.</p>

        <p>How about - I don't need one. I never get a flu shot, why would I get this? It just plays to the narrative that there is a deadly pandemic and make future pressure for unnecessary medial procedures more likely. I am doing my bit to avoid a Marek's disease situation by not playing into the fear.</p>

        <p>A better question is “what should be done with the vaccinated” as they have been shown to be an actual threat to the normal people.  My view is that a 40 day post jab quarantine is justified, but afterwards they would be free to go.</p>
<p>This won’t happen, so we may need to lay low for a while.</p>

        <p>For medical reasons I can't do the injection (neither can 20% of US population according to Pfizer's public documents on exclusion!) but I have anti-bodies. </p>
<p>Most likely from when I was hospitalized in December for a ketamine infusion. I was stoked even if I had wicked legspasms for a week, having a spinal cord injury. </p>
<p>Test everyone for antibodies. These protect even better than the injection! Mass testing of antibodies is the only sane solution.</p>

        <p>Nothing but I will not be bringing my children or granddaughter near them.    That goes for all vaccines not just this last one.   My dad is medically fragile so he could get very ill or die and my granddaughter is very young so she will not be exposed to anyone who might have smallpox or polio or covid.    I don't care if the unvaxed people get sick.    I don't even care if they die... that's their choice.   But my family won't be suffering because of their choice.    I think that is fair.</p>

        <p>I'm not afraid.    I didn't let my kids play with unvaxed kids when they were little either.    I have never done so... it had nothing to do with covid then and it doesn't now.   I have a kid who had an allergy to some vaccines and wasn't able to become fully immune to some things... for that reason I avoided interacting with people who could make MY child ill.   As I said before I could care less what you do with your life and your health.    But you can not expect me to risk the health of people I actually care about to what??? Spend time with some random person who means nothing to me?    What do I care if you are socially isolated?   It's not my job or responsibility to make you feel happy and included.    You are no one and not special.    I owe you literally nothing... I support your choice to not get the vaccine.    I will even fight for your right to remain unvaxed.    But don't expect me to interact with our spend time with you.    You can do what you want... I will also do what I want.    And anyway its not like we can tell who has the vaccine or not so just lie or don't mention it either way and no one will ever know the difference.    Why do you care if vaccinated people don't want to spend time with you??? Don't you think we are all worthless idiot government shills??? Why would you want to interact with us anyway?   Get over yourself... you are not untitled to anyone's time or attention.    No one really cares about you or your little crusade.    And if people choose to avoid you then that is their choice.   You can not do anything about that.    And that means that you finally achieved your main goal... you are no longer the majority who is responsible but the bad things that happen to minority groups... you are now a persecuted minority in your own right.    Isn't that what you are all going for??? You want to become a bullying victim but no one cares enough about you to actually bully you.    😔</p>

        <p>Lol you are an idiot.    Obviously her parents are waiting until a proven safe variant is available.   Also there are multiple vaccines and only one is suspected to be problematic and that one is only suspected.    Grow up with your doomsday bullshit.   There is a such thing as caution without being totally polarized in one direction or the other.    I waited until plenty of people had gotten the vaccine and then chose the one which had fewer side effects.   Was that cold blooded??? Probably.    Do I care??? Not even a little bit.</p>

        <p>No badges, no blanket ostracizing. However, you make your choice not to be vaccinated, those who don’t want to be around you have the right to make their choice, too. You don’t get to make a decision that greatly affects others and tell them they can’t choose how to live their lives away from you. </p>
<p>Those talking about ‘mandatory vaccine passports’ - you know we’ve had required vaccination records since the 1850s, right?</p>
<p>And eradicated diseases, like smallpox and polio, were suppressed and eradicated due to required vaccination. Measles used to be gone, but then folks started believing whatever they “believe” instead of looking to actual proven science. </p>
<p>So yes, your kids don’t get to go to school (they already don’t, without qualified reason), you may not get the job you lost want cause your coworkers don’t want to share space with someone who won’t protect their health, you don’t get to go in everywhere you want, etc. It’s the social contract at its most basic.</p>

        <p>In order to protect everyone from Covid, we need to reach herd immunity.  That's likely a 70%-90% vaccination rate, but no one knows for sure.  I have confidence in the vaccine I've taken and it'll help me fine, but it's most effective if almost everyone takes it.  </p>
<p>The key reason herd immunity is important is because if we allow the virus to continue among non-vaccinated, it will continue to mutate, producing more variants.  </p>
<p>It's likely there will be a variant that our vaccinations can't protect against, and then we are back to having a pandemic, one that could easily be more deadly than this one.  </p>
<p>People who refuse to vaccinate for some imagined danger / political reason will be the main contributors to continuing this pandemic for years to come.</p>

<p>Lol. The concern for mutations and variants only exists for coronavirus?</p>
<p>Before the "pandemic", where was our concern with the hundreds of thousands of other viruses, bacteria, and fungal "threats" that are constantly evolving and mutating? A process that has been going on since forever.</p>
<p>How many invisible bugs are floating around out there in the world? Unidentified. Unknown. </p>
<p>They are growing. Mutating. I'm literally shaking in fear.</p>
<p>Using you insane logic we should all be dead.</p>

        <p>That makes no sense.  Yes, there are potentially other viruses that may cause another pandemic.  That is a concern, and is being researched.  Overuse of antibiotics, for instance, is creating strains of bacteria that are immune to our best antibiotics.  It's a real problem.</p>
<p>It does not mean every bug out there is going to evolve into something more deadly.</p>
<p>However, in the just 1.5 years that Covid-19 has been out in human populations, there have been several variants that are more contagious than the original one.  We see it happening, and as the pandemic continues, the likely hood that one of those variants will be even more deadly and not covered by our current vaccine grows bigger and bigger.</p>

        <p>What doesn't make sense is following your logic. that we should fear the "variants" of little bugs. Which are in number so vast beyond comprehension, and which permeate throughout the earth.</p>
<p>The population of microscopic organisms is so large and varied, and it is constantly changing. According to your logic, we should be living in a perpetual state of a ravaging pandemic. In fact, the human population should have gone extinct.</p>

        <p>It's not fear mongering.  It's simply the truth.  There are multiple variants of the Covid virus, in India, UK, Africa, Brazil and others.  These exist right now.  It's happened.  Multiple times.  We are in a race to get as many people vaccinated as possible before some new variant appears that is even more deadly. </p>
<p>Mutations in viruses ARE happening, all over the place, but the vast, vast majority of them don't affect humans, or the mutations don't make them any more dangerous, or our immune system handles it, so we don't have to worry about those.  Those that do affect us, like the flu (which has multiple new variants every year), we have to guard against by creating new flu vaccines every year.  We continue to get the flu because it's mutated and our immune system doesn't recognize the new variant.</p>
<p>If we don't reach herd immunity, Covid will continue to mutate, and the pandemic will continue.</p>

        <p>There's no script here.</p>
<p>You've made a single point that if we are worried about covid variants, then why aren't we worried about variants of all the viruses and bacteria out there?</p>
<p>I've explained that while mutations occur all the time in viruses and bacteria, the vast majority we don't have to worry about.  Antibiotic resistance, and the flu are two examples of bacteria and viruses that do mutate, and we DO have to worry about, which is why we keep coming up with new antibiotics and new flu vaccines each year.  Covid is another one that we have to be careful of, as we've already seen new variants that are more contagious.</p>
<p>I'm clearly not a bot, and there is no 'propaganda' here.  I just want to talk about the truth of Covid vaccines because vaccine hesitancy will only make this pandemic last longer, and I want things to return to normal.</p>

        <p>The most recent research suggests that vaccinated people are far less likely to transmit the virus to anyone else.  This makes sense as the 'viral load' (basically, the number of viruses in our body), is much, much less for vaccinated people, and therefore are far less likely to pass it on to someone else.</p>
<p>Vaccinated people may still transmit the virus, but it's much, much less likely.</p>

        <p>Unluckily for us, they got the science on they're side. When a vaccine actually works the virus disappears of the face of the earth having no host for mutate. that's a fact that we can't avoid, a lot of illnesses disappeared even in undeveloped countries thanks to vaccination with actual vaccines so is easy for them to think that is the same with the rona and could actually be the same if a real, tested, developed, vaccine existed but ¿who wants an undeveloped, untested, dangerous and fake vaccine for the common cold? ¿who cares about the common cold?, ¿can't you give me a vaccine for AIDS instead? that will be cool. So this can't be our argument, because ¿who doesn't want to be vaccinated against a dangerous illness?</p>
<p>If I could be vaccinated against HIV, ebola, rabies, dengue, hanta v. or some actually dangerous illness, bet your ass I would be... ¿who won't?</p>
<p>Our enemy here is that people are afraid of a virus that doesn't have the capacity to be really dangerous. Coronaviruses (common colds) exists since before us, they are not sufficiently harmful to humanity and they can't be, they fiscally can't.</p>

<p>Acting like the world should be yours on a platter and you won't even do so little as donning a piece of cloth in return. This kind of rhetoric is exactly how you guys end up starting the kind of culture wars you claim to be against. Absurd.</p>

        <p>Want to be unvaccinated, well your kids will go to a school for unvaccinated kids. The only difference will be the kids are unvaccinated, and they cannot play sports with other schools. Just to protect those kids who can't get vaccines due to their own personal health conditions.</p>

        <p>Yeah it's been really nice here, I haven't worn a mask in months and aside from my sister across the country, no one I've seen face to face in the last few months has had the Covid. Not my younger brother who goes to elementary school, not my friend who works directly with customers at a PC repair shop, not my sister who does DoorDash, and definitely not myself.

        <p>It's obvious that the obese, elderly.people.tou are talking about were dying soon no matter what. Flu, cold, a tricky flight of stairs - these people were on the way out. Sad but it's a fact of life that you die and the healthiness you keep yourself in has a ton to do with it.</p>

        <p>That's a cop out. You're saying thank science the way someone would say thank god. That. Is. Fkd. Do you think science has it all figured out? All of modern science and medicine couldn't cure the common cold. Until they rebranded it as cOvId that is. Anyway, are you worried about catching the Rona? If you're morbidly obese, diabetic and asmatic with a heart condition then fair enough. If you're younger than 70 and healthy then wtf is wrong with you? Also, what about all the grannies that used to die of the flu every year before cOvId? Why didn't we shut down the world every year and force everyone to wear completely useless cloth face masks and carry flu shot passports before cOvId? Oh yeah......coz that's insane!</p>

        <p>&rt;Some businesses may require it to shop or work there but hey don't go there then. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a business is forced to institute a policy because of government it isn't a private policy (e g. Fine for not requiring masks)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a corporatized monopolistic system where a select few companies leverage the power of the state, "the rights of the free market" is not on the table as they would be in an actual free market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private medical information is protected information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;If the gov goes mandatory I'll be on the other side (vaccinated thank science), nobody should have the government tell them what to do with their insides.</p>
<p>Then I agree with you  some caveats to your first statement but I largely agree with a companies right to have policies too. It's just not that simple in our current system.</p>

        <p>As long as you think it's ok for the business to not give a fuck too, then ya ok I guess. My only issue here is that a select group of companies have used the gov as a way to monopolize. This would be an easy way for a government to step around the constitution.</p>

<li>
<p>Company lobbies gov for regulation that helps them monopolize</p>

<p>For me, obviously not a doctor but, if a person who has health issues, but wasnt hospitalized or in grave condition before contracting covid, dies from complications of the health issue because covid exacerbated it, it should counted as a covid death.</p>

        <p>Going off purely personal anecdotal evidence (I know A LOT of people) it was blown out of proportion. I had it, my husband had it, I know old people that had it, fat people that had it...I don’t know even by 6 degrees, anyone who died. If we were in a real pandemic that just wouldn’t be the case. Yes, people died. But the flu was also apparently non existent...the whole thing is shady to me</p>

        <p>Just two hospitalizations from my family, one immunocompromised, one seemingly healthy. But we all took the most vulnerable members health seriously enough to keep them from getting it, even just from abundance of caution ya know. </p>

        <p>It's not for my benefit. I have been fortunate enough to be vaccinated and am a younger healthy person. It is for the benefit of our neighbors and family members who also want to go back to life pre-covid, where they could actually go out in public. </p>
<p>I want things to go back to normal and the way we do that is to get people vaccinated as fast as we can, so ironically, it is the supporters of this sub who are causing this "new normal" to last longer than it needs to.</p>

        <p>Have you been in public any time in the last year? If any rational person thought there was danger to the Covid, they should stay inside until Uncle Sam tells them it's safe to live their life again. Getting vaccinated as a healthy, young person makes no sense to me, as it doesn't even stop you from getting infected.</p>

        <p>It doesn't prevent transmission. It's supposed to reduce the severity of symptoms...when 85% of cases are asymptomatic. 0.03% who have it and another co-morbidity die. That leaves 99.74% alive.</p>
<p>As for "going back to normal"; keep telling yourself that your government will give back the hard fought for freedoms you willingly gave up so you could sit on your arse and binge watch mindless shit on Netflix instead of reading papers &amp; critically thinking about what the real world implications of the inconsistencies of your governments lockdown guidelines are and will continue to be for years to come.</p>
<p>You were told that this would last two weeks. How does it feel, knowing you will swallow any crap, as long as it appears on a screen with a red banner, even if it is harmful in real life?

        <p>What about other diseases? You want every human to be vaccinated for every single disease so that the immunocompromised can be protected? What is the percent of such people in the population? How about those that have serious and fatal reaction to the jab but were otherwise healthy? How many of those have lost their lives already to taking the unproven experimental vaccine? Does the number of people who have already died or seriously injured greater than the number of immunocompromised who cannot take the vaccine? Have you done the numbers there? If you are authoritarian like this, maybe you will feel better living in an authoritarian country like North Korea. Consider moving there?</p>

        <p>Lol okay, thinking that people should get vaccinated to protect others is not authoritarian (I'm libertarian BTW, literally the opposite).</p>
<p>The number of people who suffer from complications from vaccines is vastly smaller than the number of people who are immunocompromised. Try getting your data from somewhere else besides the New York Post.</p>
<p>I do not believe that the government should step in to dictate what we do with willingly unvaccinated individuals. HOWEVER, I am 100% all for private businesses choosing to only serve vaccinated individuals. And I feel that we as a society should shun those who willingly choose to not help get past this pandemic (in which 600,000 have died in the past year).</p>
<p>You are free to believe what you want and do what you want with your body (bodily autonomy is one of my key ideas of a free society), but you are not free from the societal consequences of your actions. Don't be suprised if unvaccinated people stop getting invited to social events. That's not the government doing that, that is our peers deciding to avoid individuals who obviously do not care about other people.</p>

        <p>So I, as a healthy person with no underlying conditions, should get a vaccine that <em>probably won't</em> kill me, so that I <em>hopefully won't</em> get a virus that has a 99+% survival rate that <em>potentially might</em> mutate into something even more dangerous?</p>
<p>What if instead I don't do any of that and continue living my life while others beg their government to let them leave the house.</p>

        <p>You aren't getting vaccinated for yourself, you are getting vaccinated so that you don't give the virus to someone who is not as healthy as you are. If getting a vaccine only affected you as an individual, I wouldn't give a rat's ass of you got it. But vaccinating yourself protects others around you.</p>
<p>Also, just because you are healthy doesn't mean you won't get horribly sick from it, it just is statistically less likely, but not zero percent. I've got friends (healthy, mid 20s) who each got the virus last summer and, Although they didn't get hospitalized, they still have bad side effects like severe fatigue/brain fog and breathing issues</p>

        <p>I think the possible government overreach is mostly the concern for them, the health issues have no stance to them as far as getting forced into compliance. Sadly I kinda agree, there will never be an ok reason to mandate choices like this to individuals, even in times of crisis.</p>

        <p>There are about 10 million immunocompromised adults in the US.</p>
<p>Cancer patients, organ transplants, HIV/AIDS patients, people with auto immune diseases etc. Some of them can take the vaccine, but will have less protection than the general population. Which is why we aim for herd immunity, so that any stray infection in the population will be stopped as soon as possible, hopefully before it reaches an immunocompromised person.</p>

        <p>Ah, yes, the tiny minority of people who can't get the vaccine - we should totally change society and get ourselves vaccinated just to protect them when they could die from anything at a moment's notice anyway.

        <p>I know I'm not going to change how you feel about anything, but this is disappointing to read. </p>
<p>Covid is more dangerous for my daughter due to her heart/kidney disease. I don't think it's fair to suggest she stay home indefinitely because healthy people refuse the vaccine and we can't establish proper herd immunity. Your suggestion that she "could die of anything at a moment's notice" is not accurate either. She's eight years old and has a long life ahead of her. </p>
<p>It sounds like you're trying to make a lot of excuses instead of just admitting that your decision to not get vaccinated is selfish.</p>

        <p>Sorry to hear about your daughter. Herd immunity is achieved through vaccination and infection. For all I know I already might have the antibodies needed to fight Covid. The fact that they aren't testing people for natural immunity before adminstering the vaccine should raise some eyebrows.</p>

        <p>If I had to guess I would assume they aren't doing that because getting the vaccine out to as many people as possible is the priority. Which would make sense considering how many people have died.  </p>
<p>To be honest though I've never heard of anyone being tested for immunity before receiving any kind of vaccine; so I would have to do some research on that before attempting to discuss it.</p>

        <p>The spread of the virus when vaccinated isn't known yet and probably differs by the vaccine you used. Yes we should absolutely protect them because they are part of the same society. The word is solidarity but I doubt you know what that means.
The other point would be that you fucking dumbasses give the virus time and a place to mutate and potential overcome the vaccine</p>

        <p>Ahhh now the Nutjob bs again. Yes it's safe. As safe as any medicine. The very minor risk of any impactful side effect is way lower than the risk of having life long lungs scars because you had a bad case of rona. The vaccine is preventing any harsh cases. You can still have the virus in your body put it doesn't affect you. They said that from the very fucking start so either you are deaf and blind or ignored it because it fits your weirdo agenda</p>

        <p>No it's actually dangerous. Mass vaccination is currently causing mutations, to which other vaccinated people that need protection, aren't protected from. It is key to just vaccinate those at risk. Young people who are not at risk from bad covid, should just build broader natural immunity, which is the driver for herd immunity and that will proctect those that can't protect themselves. I don't blame you personally for getting vaccinated because there is massive mediatic manipulation going on.</p>

        <p>Nope, it's causing mutation. The mutations were only emerging as from the vaccine trials and roll out. They are causing mutation through immune escape via viral environmental adaptation. These mutations all occurr on the spike protein, because that protein is being targeted by current flawed vaccines, of which the induced immunity is so narrow that they won't protect against these mutations.</p>

        <p>Everytime I hear "mainstream media" i see a redneck incest offspring with foam in front of the mouth. You are like a broken record repeating what your favorite conspiracy YouTuber is telling you but want to complain about "mainstream media". There are tons of neutral media outlets. If you ignore them I and turn to conspiracy bullshit that's your problem. The reality is all your whining will change nothing. Either you comply and start to be a useful part of society or you will lose parts of your freedom. I don't care. I will be enjoying life while you will be too afraid to get a vaccine like a 3 yo</p>

        <p>Ivermectin and HCQ with Zinc in early stages does the same with no side effects. Why get an experimental vaccine that you've said yourself you don't know about spreading the virus while vaccinated yet, when you can take something that's been sold for decades over the counter and shows excellent results in early onset?</p>
<p>And that's just if you need it, the majority of cases of covid are a headache or the sniffles and back to business. The people dying are unhealthy to begin with, lacking vitamin D, obese etc. The average age of death is close to the average life expectancy.</p>
<p>So Ivermectin and HCQ prevent harsh cases with no side effects.</p>
<p>The experimental vaccine is said to lessen symptoms but it doesn't stop you catching covid or spreading it. There are a lot of unknowns. And there are quite a lot of adverse reactions and deaths happening after vaccination.</p>
<p>There is nothing at all you can tell me to convince me that this experimental vaccine is necessary. The fact that HCQ and Ivermectin was a "conspiracy theory" and baseless Qanon Trump bullshit a year ago, manipulated by mainstream media, and now a year later it's starting to come out that it is effective and safe (in the mainstream, most of us in this sub knew last year), should really raise flags for people.</p>
<p>Your statement that the vaccine will allow you to have the virus in your body but not affect you is false. There are many people getting sick with covid after the jab. </p>
<p>And what weirdo agenda are you referring to? Every human having rights and bodily autonomy? People being able to question things and make their own decisions? The right to refuse a medical procedure? Not wanting to be discriminated against for not taking an indirectly forced medical procedure with only about 25% of the information freely available to the public?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I would say you spending so much time on a sub full of what you think to be selfish idiots is a weirdo agenda too. What's the plan? You're going to change all of our minds? Your comments read like every other shill's.</p>

        <p>The difference between the virus and the vaccine is that the virus is treatable. Yet all treatment protocols are prohibited. Doesn't it seem funny how in a deadly pandemic, there is actually no first line healthcare? When people get infected they are instructed to do nothing but quarantine and let the virus fester untill people are sick enough to be hospitalized. There are regions in INdia where hosptalization now dropped with 92% through first line treatment with ivermectin combinde with zinc and a broad spectrum antibiotic.</p>

        <p>The vaccine doesn't need to be treatable lol. What do you want to treat? Side effects? There absolutely are treatments for that. Ivermetcin does help but first of all the studies on that just got finished and it's enormously harder to produce in great quantities than a vaccine. Vaccines are generally extremely easy to manufacture in huge amounts. I also really don't get that logic. Vaccine that prevents you completely from getting sick and is produced by big pharma? Bad. Medicial that treats you after you already got infected and is also produced by big pharma? GOod.
I don't get it</p>

        <p>What the vaccine does isn't treatable, because once injected, there's no way back. It doesn't matter what it does or does not do exactly.</p>
<p>Ivermectin is cheap and mass producable and safe. Great results are seen where politics don't prohibit first line use of it. It's proven safe for decennia. We can't say the same for these novel experimental vaccines. Reports of adverse reactions are all over the place.</p>
<p>These novel vaccines don't prevent infection. The UK, having a high vaccinated population, is now facing a new wave of covid outbreaks. The vaccines are flawed. The early medicinal treatment however has very high succes rate.</p>

        <p>IVM is safe and has no adverse side effects with even 10 fold dosage. Off label use of medicine is common practice. This medication has been used for decennia without problems. The novel vaccines are just around for half a year or so, and have caused many problems ranging from blood cloths and thrombocytopenia to myocarditis and instant death. And then there's the lack of research on long term issues.</p>

        <p>IVM used for covid is 0.2mg/kg to 0.4mg/kg, based on bodyweight. As I said, it is being administered in India, Bangladesh,... with great succes. In no way those dosages are toxic. At most it will get people rid of parasites, if not preventing bad covid. Ultimately this provides a far better broader natural immune response instead of the narrow vaccine induced response, which is the reason of breakthrough cases.</p>

        <p>😂😂😂 You realize the drugs you are talking about are manufactured by big pharma and they would probably make a lot more money if everybody would be treated with those drugs because they are way more expensive than the vaccines?</p>

        <p>The vaccines are cheaper but they are being purchased in massive bulk, like millions of doses at once. The cost usually comes down with the more you buy of something.</p>
<p>I won't be taking a vaccine because I don't need one with my age and health, and I don't trust them anyway. If I was in need of something for covid, I would be happier to use something tried and tested over years with no side effects, even if it cost me 300 or so. The cases of covid that need medical attention are worst case scenarios with a host of co-morbidities. I know enough to keep myself healthy before catching anything.</p>
<p>My country has made huge purchases of vaccines, which I will pay for despite not wanting or needing one. The taxpayer pays for everything. </p>
<p>When I say big pharma, I mean the ones that have their hands in everything, that are not liable to pay for damages through vaccination, that lobby for politicians and so on. It is about the "right" people making money, not everyone.</p>
<p>Not everyone needs to be treated for covid, in fact a tiny fraction of people infected need it. If we were doing this whole thing right, I would have no issues with my taxes paying to treat people badly affected with a safe and effective drug. But we are not doing this right, the message is that covid is extremely deadly, everyone needs to be vaccinated for immunity and any questioning of that is selfish and insane. This is all bullshit though, anyone with half a rational thought can see that.</p>

        <p>Ivermetcin has been in use since 2015 as a medication against ektoparasites. It has side effects and it has been tested less in relation to covid than the vaccines. Anyone with half a rational thought knows that relying on vaccines is much safer and better in 100% of cases. The fact that without an immunity the virus can keep on mutating and has the potential to turn into something Really nasty alone is enough to sustain thst claim</p>

        <p>When a virus mutates, most of the time it has no bearing on the way it acts, or it actually weakens it. This can be seen from all the mainstream news headline about variants and mutations the past year that have done absolutely nothing but promote more fear among the already fearful.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of antibodies? Natural immunity? </p>
<p>In studies of side effects from Ivermectin, there were less than 1% of participants affected with non life threatening side effects. In the cases of using it along with zinc that many doctors, in particular in India, are doing now, there has been 100% success rate and no adverse reactions.</p>
<p>Go to VAERS and look at the stats. Tell me these experimental jabs have no side effects or deaths related. They say around 1-10% of events actually get reported on VAERS and there have been more events in 2021 from these "safe and effective" vaccines than a span of decades.</p>
<p>You can keep replying if you want, but it's really a wasted effort in here.</p>

<p>Just give it up man. I ate up all that censored propaganda? You're an idiot, that's not how propaganda works. You don't have to search hard for propaganda, that's the whole point.</p>
<p>The only people I can find talking negatively about Ivermectin, apart from shills, bots and lemmings like yourself, are the corrupt "health institutions" like the WHO and Fauci's NIH. The ones who are dismissing anything but vaccines as the answer. The ones who are in bed with the vaccine manufacturers.</p>
<p>Maybe you think you're owning us in here, or maybe you're paid to spread misinformation and don't have a consience, but you're the one looking stupid.</p>

        <p>Not "all" the health institutions.</p>
<p>If you follow the money you find answers. This is the case with pretty much everything that goes on in the world. It's naive to think otherwise.</p>
<p>It makes lots of sense but you're clearly not interested in thinking outside of that little safe box that's been prepared for you. OR you are a shill.
Either way the things you're saying are easily disproven, and as soon as they are you backtrack on what you said or bring up some other obviously incorrect point. </p>
<p>You take your vaccine champ. Not everyone agrees that is the way to go, and that doesn't make them stupid or selfish just because you don't understand what you're talking about. Your body is yours to do whatever with, just like everyone else's.</p>

        <p>The last I heard in the news cycles (don't watch often so this may have changed like a lot of definitions lately) the spike protines were doing all the Killin and now each of you who took their injection are fancy little walking spike protines factories. Regardless if shedding is a reality. The cocktail you took literally teaches the cells within you to produce the protein which you are to be protected.  This tech, this MRNA tech has been attempted in the past with no success. Somehow slapping eua on the label makes all that go away and it's completely safe now? Not how science works. Science is designed to be question, scrutinized, proved wrong.  That's how we advance science is thru failure. Unfortunately they have never gotten past the failure stage with this scientific technology</p>

The spike proteins are doing no killing they have absolutely nothing to do with killing. Like Really.

        <p>A side thought.  How are they able to peddle these injection as either safe or effective?  Safe in what capacity. Effective how?  They were calling them "safe and effective" while they were still saying you can catch carry and transmit. I mean I get it it's new and we aren't 100% sure how this will go but that's my point, if we don't know, we don't know either way.   If it can be said that there are so many unknowns how can they slap safe and effective on a medicine in which they are still learning about.  One operating under the rules of an EUA which requires there to be no other reasonable treatment or prophylactic for?  Will the EUA be withdrawn if it were to come out that ivermectin or hcq or any other existing drug could be such a treatment? Or is it like all those companies we bailed out a few years back, too big to fail so we just keep sinking into it like it's the best thing to do even though we may think and believe otherwise. 
I'll go out and assume since you are such an advocate for these injections you've had yours and I'm not able, even if I could help you see my point of view, to change that. You stand on your hill and I'll continue dutifully observing the hillside against the horizon untill I find my place to stand.  I'm not out to tell someone else how to think, But I'm growing ever tired of not receiving the same respect returned</p>

        <p>We don't know because it's not one virus anymore. It's multiple mutations whit different potencies. Some of this mutations could in theory help the virus to breach the vaccine protection. The efficiency can differ depending on what mutation you catch. The mRNA ones had the best results so far in test with the different mutations. So the problem regarding efficiency isn't that we have a missing understanding of our vaccines but that we can't keep track of all different mutations and following that can't guarantee that one mutation might breach it. That's why for the efficiency of the vaccines to be high its good if a lot of people get the vaccine early. For the safety the european medical agency has issued normal licenses for Astra, Moderna, Biontech after operating their own testing trial. The chance to have side effects is also lower than to catch covid and get permanent damage from it</p>

        <p>What permanent damage can you claim on a virus less than 2 years old tho.  I agree to the converse that we can't claim none either. That is my entire point tho.  There are arguments on each side with validity, and there are arguments of pure Idiocracy however it is the freedom of choice that is being attacked.  The freedoms we previously valued and held in the highest regard. That is where my issue lies.   I had the freedom of choice to take the flu shot.  I have the god given freedom of choice to take this one.  Anything that one will suffer as a punishment for not CHOSING to take this one is an attack on their rights and cannot be construed any other way. That is an opinion you will not change.</p>

        <p>Protein shedding doesn't have unknown repercussions but it doesn't happen with the covid jabs anyway. I also don't see why you suddendly seem to be afraid of the spike protein shedding from the vaccine but seemingly aren't afraid about the real spike protein shedding when somebody has an infection.</p>

        <p>It's not a one or another it's more of an added risk.  I'm fairly healthy, eat well exercise, get plenty of sun, my immune system has done me well over the years and I very rarely get sick and I work in some pretty nasty environments.  The science here lately is saying that natural immunity could very well be life long if not long lasting. I do not fear the virus or a spike protine. Im just not convinced that perposefully putting myself at risk for complications from a still experimental injection outweighs my risk of contracting or having lasting effects from the virus. All I ask is not to be chastised for following my best judgement on this.</p>

        <p>Well my bff got the jab and now has no control over one side of his face so, it's kind of a tit-for-tat on that.  I'm not ignoring virus complications either but to say one is "One million time safer" is a fallacy. Neither have existed long enough to know what happens to the body 2,4,10 years or generations down the line.   I'm not claiming the vax is more deadly than the virus I'm saying they each come with a risk you know it to be true but you will place false values to make yourself feel more comfortable in your decisions.  I'm secure in my current choice, key word being current, to not get the injection.  Are you able to say with 100% honesty that you have no worries of long term effects of what you have done</p>

        <p>Fair enough but those same vector vaccine tech must have gone thru rigorous testing and scrutinization before being released on the open market.  This step has been overstepped. As far as I'm concerned once the safety data and risk analysis is complete I will make my choice as to whether or not I or my children will receive this one.   I'm not anti vax, I just trust science and as for my 34years on this planet go science has taught me to question everything. How many time have these same companies produced, developed, and released a product to the public that has been damaging even knowingly damaging to health.  I'll trust them when the data says I should not when the all mighty Joe and the main stream media does.   For what it's worth I'm not a republican either.  Trump could go fuck himself with whatever syringe he was toting too.<br>
I'll be honest here.  The entirety of the push to get and blockade of any information regarding I'll effects have completely turned me off of the idea of taking this one.   We are not trusted to have an informed opinion we are only required to have the opinion handed to us.</p>

        <p>So it's not a tool, it's a symbol. One that hasn't really been proven to be effective at stopping community transmission.</p>
<p>The slight inconvenience isn't the issue. It's the attitude of people like you that's the issue. If you were mature enough to view it as a tool, I'd have no problem with it.</p>
<p>How am I infecting people with a largely non lethal disease (it doesn't kill more than it kills) if I'm not sick? What vulnerable people am I hanging out with?</p>

        <p>Are you suggesting laws be drafted that prevent the spread of respiratory viruses and punish those who infect others? </p>
<p>I'm going to venture that you never cared about this sort of thing until 2020. One of the biggest differences between the flu and covid (or hell, any other coronavirus and covid) is that covid grants liberals an opportunity to trade their theatrical performative "concern" for social credit. </p>
<p>In any event, any sort of technocratic "utopian" structure that policies the health of citizens and punishes "violators" would be horrific beyond belief. Freedom isn't free; slavery exacts a far greater price.</p>
