    <strong>Why are people getting the vaccine even if they do not trust it? If you got the vaccine and do not trust it, what motivated you to do so?</strong>
    <p><p>In the last 2 days, I have spoken with 4 people in my community. They all told me they had the vaccine. I didn't ask, didn't bring it up at all. They threw it out there with their introductions. All 4 then went on to tell me they got it but don't trust it. Two said they regretted getting it altogether. </p>
<p>One lady explained that they got it because she figured her job and her husband's job would end up forcing them to get it anyways. It would be easier to already have it. She also said she and her entire family were deathly sick after getting the second Pfizer shot. She said she was afraid of the third shot they're trying to push. She then explained to me all the reason why she did not trust the vaccines. </p>
<p>Another couple told me they decided to get it because they had a relative with leukemia. Perfectly fine reason to get it. I'm all for people getting it if that's what they want to do. I just want the media, big Pharma, government, etc to be honest with us all about what they're trying to force on us...and I want them to not force it on us. This couple also told me they got very sick after the second Johnson shot. Also went on to describe how much regret they felt after learning about all the horrible possible side effects. </p>
<p>All four people I talked to were unaware the vaccines are not FDA approved. 3 of them were unaware this is new vaccine technology and not the same as the others we commonly get. </p>
<p>And this was just in the last few days. I don't know what other people's experiences are like, but in my experience this is usually how people feel. The majority of people I talk to who have got the vaccine didn't really feel safe doing it or regretted it afterwards. I have talked to 2 people who are all for it and didn't mind being deathly sick. </p>
<p>So my question is, why are people getting the shot despite being worried about it? I understand some reasons but others seem to just be getting it because they feel coerced. Whether it be fear of losing their job, not being able to go to school, or whatever. I'd really like to see some data on how many people got the vaccines but either regret it or didn't really feel safe but did it anyways. </p>
<p>If you got the vaccine but didn't feel safe doing so or now regret it, what made you decide to do it? Were you afraid of losing your job? Did you feel pressured by the media because "everyone else is doing it, and you had better as well?" Did you want to avoid being the outcast? Did you think your peers would see you as a science denier? Were you just trying to do your part to avoid more lockdowns? </p>
<p>In my case, I don't think my family could hold up to too much pressure from the government. If my husband's job told him to get the vaccine or quit, he would get it because he needs to provide for us. If grocery stores won't let us buy food to feed our children without proof of vaccine, I'd do everything I could to avoid it.However, I would not let my kids starve because I'm worried about my health. </p>
<p>Luckily, my kids don't go to school so I'm not worried about schools forcing vaccines. However, I babysit a 12 year old girl every day and she has begged me to find a way to help her avoid getting the vaccine when her school forces it. She knows about kids dying and she saw the girl on FOX news in a wheelchair with a tube in her nose. She has to go to school though so her parents would end up playing Russian Roulette with her life and health to get her in school. </p>
<p>Sad thing is, the powers that be know that the vast majority of us will cave to the vaccines when our jobs are on the line or we can't feed out kids. That's what they will do if we don't all just comply. People are already feeling forced to comply and it hasn't even gone full totalitarian yet.</p></p>

        <p>Look at it this way if we don't get it were outsiders and hated by the vaxx ones ( p.s I don't have any jab(s) </p>
<p>And the way society is going at the moment and the government we totally fucked. Its like putting two pitballs in a dog fight..ones the aggressors and the other are just like fuck what choice to do have. </p>
<p>I really don't want it ..but for the career I want. Its being held against my will. And its like blackmail..  </p>
<p>I can either fight it and fight it. Or piss off too the woods and live in a tent â›º and hope for the best. </p>
<p>I'm not going to give in that's for sure . Having a liver disease i don't want risk what that poison could do. Its a spin the wheel of misfortunes.. I could have no side effects or I could have them and my liver could get more damaged .. do you see what I am up against health wise too. </p>
<p>I'm not a quitter and I won't go and take this jab quietly or be forced into it. Because the elite want to hide the bigger picture thats its more about control than health. </p>
<p>Why make vaxx passports why are they trying to force it on you and make it mandate. </p>
<p>Why does freedom have to suffer because we choose not to take it . Why are they exempt from the vaxx passports. It don't make sense. </p>
<p>FYI them photos of elite / government were probably salin and water. I don't bloody buy it at all. I'm not easy fooled and I've been wide awake since this started</p>
<p>Sorry its long and a rant</p>

        <p>Want your mind truly blown? The PREP Act was amended in March 2020 to make all doctors and nurses exempt from any tort liability. Aka doctors no longer are required to obtain informed consent. </p>
<p>In case anyone was wondering how thatâ€™s happening. Doctors literally have been given the green light to go Kevorkian. </p>
<p>This explains why hospitals can coerce their doctors into forcing these things into people. Most healthcare workers probably just try to ignore this and pray they arenâ€™t doing wrong. Which I think was justifiable in the beginning. Now,however, I fundamentally believe any doctor or nurse who turns their head the other way and continues to jab people without their full informed consent should be sent to jail.</p>

        <p>Vaccine mandates for all is the endgame . People are scared of being ostracized from society whether it be school, work , travel, etc. â€¦When and not if mandates are mandatory for almost every aspect of life people will have no problem giving up the integrity of there cellular and immune systems for a lovely dinner at Olive Gardenâ€¦what more do you have to fight for when your own body is compromised?</p>
