    <p><p>Really. If you can actually convince me that the vaccines aren't safe, I'll do my best to prevent my other family members who haven't taken it to not take it.</p></p>

        <p>The vaccine is safe for most people, not all people. There is definitely no long term studies in that vaccine so no one actually knows what will happen in 5 years time. No one is stopping you or anyone else taking the vaccine. All we want is free choice whether or not to take the vaccine and we don't want a two tiered society where different rules applied to vaccinated and unvaccinated. </p>
<p>Pretty simple bud.</p>

<p>Yes, a tiny minority. </p>

<p>Aight but— Do you have any studies proving and detaiing why "covid vaccine bad"? For one, Mrna vaccines have been studied since the 1990s. https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/</p>

        <p>Hi, I just stumbled upon this thread and I'd like to say that I think it's great that you're mostly respectful and curious. I can't speak for other reddit users, but a large part of those who are hesitant have read or heard of the plethora of research that does not exactly show the vaccines are dangerous, but that it's impossible to claim they're safe as of right now, also.</p>
<p>A good starting point might be this episode of the Dark Horse Podcast hosted by Bret Weinstein, who invited the inventor of the mRNA delivery systems in vaccines himself. I think he'll provide a more authoritative and eloquent case than I ever could. If you are only going to follow up on one source I post, I recommend it should be this one, as it is the newest and mentions research papers and clinical findings which are brand new:</p>
<p>https://odysee.com/@BretWeinstein:f/how-to-save-the-world,-in-three-easy:0</p>
<p>I do not have an exhaustive library of scientific articles with explanations and all, prepared and ready to 'convince' other people of my viewpoints (the steady demonization that I personally encountered in my life made me quite cynical in that regard), but I'll gladly share whatever I saved on my notes app on the smart phone.</p>
<p>Here's one that has since been retracted (it is an interesting phenomenon in my opinion, that a lot of peer-reviewed articles on the cautious side later get retracted), it focuses on a risk-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/693/htm</p>
<p>This is one of the vaccines' registration with the SEC</p>
<p>https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1682852/000119312518323562/d577473ds1.htm</p>
<p>It features sentences like</p>
<p>"Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA" and</p>
<p>"No mRNA drug has been approved in this new potential category of medicines, and may never be approved as a result of efforts by others or us. mRNA drug development has substantial clinical development and regulatory risks due to the novel and unprecedented nature of this new category of medicines."</p>
<p>Sorry, no footnotes, again, this was meant for my personal use. I'm sure with ctrl+f you can find it quickly.</p>
<p>Here's a study that found Spike protein in a lot of places. It was, according to the pharmaceutical companies, meant to stay in the injection site.</p>
<p>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33872783/</p>
<p>Here's a press release that claims Spike may show indications of cytotoxicity</p>
<p>https://www.salk.edu/news-release/the-novel-coronavirus-spike-protein-plays-additional-key-role-in-illness/</p>
<p>To counter that claim here's an opinion of one of the Anti-Antivaxx guys I like</p>
<p>https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-deadly-coronavirus-spike-protein/</p>
<p>On the other hand, here's a study that shows lung damage in hamsters due to spike</p>
<p>https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.121.318902</p>
<p>This one, again is not a peer-reviewed article, but it does show that mRNA unrelated to the vaccine may play a role in the development of cancer</p>
<p>https://www.mskcc.org/news/scientists-find-cancer-drivers-hiding-new-place</p>
<p>Here's a study I'm planning to follow up upon</p>
<p>https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04665258</p>
<p>I know it doesn't inspire confidence when he makes truly fantastical claims about the intentions behind the industry, but still, Dr. Yeadon, who used to be Pfizer's no.2 for a long time, strictly advises against its vaccine.</p>
<p>Also, your question pertained to why people are hesitant, and although this might not speak to the safety profile of the ~~vaccines~~ experimental gene therapies themselves, it is important in understanding the psychology of those against it - here is the protocol that was used to convince the WHO to recommend using PCR tests for diagnosing Sars nCov-2, although the inventor Kerry Mullis adamantly stated that it was not suitable for that very purpose</p>
<p>https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.3.2000045</p>
<p>This paper was published without going through peer review. That's why external researchers took it upon themselves to review it here</p>
<p>https://cormandrostenreview.com/report/</p>
<p>which resulted in this statement which was never followed up upon</p>
<p>https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.48.2012031</p>
<p>It also does not inspire confidence with the anti experimental gene therapy crowd that a couple of governments just kept changing definitions of ill people and cases as well as counting causally otherwise related deaths as Covid deaths when the deceased formerly tested positive (with above mentioned unsuitable diagnostic tools)</p>
<p>https://principia-scientific.com/breaking-uk-govts-own-numbers-exposes-their-covid19-fraud/</p>
<p>or, if you'll humor me and visit the conspiracy thread</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/kwhyon/the_devils_in_the_details_proof_the_uk_government/</p>
<p>You mentioned somewhere in this thread that mRNA vaccines have been researched for a long time. Well, that's true, but with disastrous results; all the animals have taken severe damage or died. I'm actually surprised humans seem to take it so well. (Sorry, no link)</p>
<p>The Covid-Vaccines themselves seem to have been in development for a long time, too. Actually, they have been developed for a longer time than we knew of Covid itself.
Page 107 shows Moderna's registration date precedes the 'offical' appearance of Covid.
 (That is, if you don't want to go down the rabbit holes of the Georgia Lab, Winnipeg Lab and Fort Detrick)</p>
<p>https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6935295-NIH-Moderna-Confidential-Agreements.html#document/p107/a568569</p>
<p>Again, I know a lot of this anecdotal, some has implications of how the pandemic itself was handled and does not relate to vaccines, but you asked about the hesitancy, and here is what I have saved on my phone rn.
If you are truly interested, there really is a lot, and I mean a lot of credible, peer-reviewed articles and papers out there that sow doubt about the narrative that these vaccines were either safe, or necessary for people who aren't in the risk groups. Try scholar.google.com, your university's data bases or search on the internet for databases that give you unpaid access (they exist) to scientific journals.</p>

        <p>The benefits to a healthy young person (of being vaccinated) are negligible (absolute risk reduction of a fraction of a percent).  The longer-term risks are unknown.  </p>

        <p>I gave you the reason. Free choice, no long term study, indemnity for the pharmaceuticals pushing this. Vaccines are safe for most NOT all people.  There is no one on this sub stopping anyone from taking the vaccine..</p>
<p>Tell me what the benefit is personally for an 18 y.o taking the vaccine?</p>

        <p>I have a study that proves that after over a year of this more than 99.95% of us didn't die, and those unfortunate few who <em>did</em> were <strong>the</strong> most vulnerable among us.  I am lucky to be in a category in which C-19 is virtually no threat to me.  Many many mistakes have been made along the way, some innocent and perhaps some <em>not</em> innocent.  Many mistakes though no matter how you slice it.  Why should I suddenly think that injecting myself with an experimental drug, for a virus that poses no threat to me, is <em>not</em> another mistake?</p>

        <p>Nobody is here to convince you to not - or to -  take it. We just want bodily autonomy to make the choice for ourselves to not take it. My reasons may be completely different from another person's reasons. It's deeply personal, and if you feel it's safe for you, more power to you. Bottom line, medical tyranny is not cool. Ever.</p>

        <p>Then what? What else is he saying other than "Don't force me to take the jab," which doesn't tackle the issue of whether one should take the vaccine?</p>
<p>If you're referring to the "Everyone has different reasons" part: Yeah but those boil down to a few core problems they have with the jab, don't they? I understand if they have medical reasons to begin with, but what about those non medical ones? I want to know why you're not taking the jab, regardless of your "different reasons". And I want to be convinced that I made the wrong decision.</p>

<p>Lol sorry just talking shit. But I truly think you’ve misunderstood the situation. You are asking the wrong people for their reasons... the people wanting to control OTHER people’s actions are always the ones that need to be justified. Why do YOU want me to take the vaccine?

<p>Almost 6000 deaths on the same database.</p>
<p>In Israel where they’ve had the vaccine the longest 1/3000 have myocarditis, and that’ll likely grow since most people likely don’t go to a doctor post vaccine but until shit happens.</p>
<p>None of this is small. All of this would have pulled any single pharma drug in history off market immediately.</p>
<p>But because of EUA and every government pushing it to the extreme there’s no real pushback, and that information isn’t widely known about as it should be now. Instead we’re doubling down and vaccinating kids. Wtf</p>

        <p>My reasoning has always been that as a healthy active 30something year old, I dont need a vaccine that causes rare side effects for a virus that has rare side effects. The percentage of any healthy person that has died of covid in my province that were under 40 is miniscule, so I feel more comfortable taking my chances with the virus over an experimental vaccine that is still in clinical trials.</p>

<p>But this? Well, we were bribed.. and then begged. And now we’re been threatened and blackmailed. </p>
<p>Does that seem normal? This vaccine is wonderful, effective and safe. So why not let it sell itself? … 🤔</p>

        <p>personally, i couldn't care less about the safety profile of the vax. the reality is its efficacy is exaggerated against transmission, infection and mild cases (it seems to work fairly well on severe disease otoh). However, its supposed efficacy against transmission in particular is used for vax mandates.</p>

        <p>see israel, the UK, singapore, they are dealing with several transmissions / outbreaks originating from vaxd individuals. each of these countries uses the pfizer vax (israel and singapore more so) and still see the same problems (transmission from vaxd individuals was seen in clusters in both israel and singapore).</p>

        <p>The problem is that the trials reported relative risk reduction instead of absolute risk reduction. What you hear on the news is Not the same statistics a normal scientist would use to talk about the efficacy of a vaccine. But... ya know, science.</p>

<p>The companies who have made it are the most corrupt unscrupulous companies on the planet, with a long history of deceiving the public.</p>
