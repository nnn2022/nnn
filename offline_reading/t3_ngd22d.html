        <p>....not entirely relevant, but a bit of a pet peeve: can we stop using the 'sheep' analogy? 
Not that I don't understand the desire to insult others, but because anyone who wants to use 'sheep' as a description for what they see as the compliant, peaceful and obedient has <em>CLEARLY</em> never been within a bloody mile of a full grown sheep (especially a ewe with a lamb), let alone tried to shear one (an experienced which can be best described as 'MMA Hairdressing' if the animal is in a surly mood, which they usually are).</p>

        <p>I mean it doesn’t matter what they die from, murder, old age, cancer etc. They put them into groups. X amount of murders, X amount of old age deaths, X amount of cancer, and 3.4 million people who have died from COVID</p>

        <p>That’s not how they count them though. CDC claims 5% of the 566,000 American deaths are directly related to covid. So around 28000. The other 95% had 4 or more medical conditions/diseases already. That doesn’t mean covid is the reason they died. It means these people were already sick with 4 or more diseases/medical conditions and were already going to die. Millions of people die in hospitals every year before covid. Millions of people are still dying in hospitals, only difference is they are dying with a positive covid test. Also if you die within 28 days of a positive covid test, you get listed as a covid death. You die in a car accident three weeks after testing positive, it’s a covid death. Only 5% of deaths are DIRECTLY related to covid. it’s on the CDC.</p>

        <p>I’m sorry did you just type naturally occurring reverse transcriptase. That’s not even close to being true. If it was, we would have a big issue with all viruses ending up in our genome. Please give me a citation of naturally occurring reverse transcriptase. </p>
<p>As for classifying as gene therapy, it’s a classification. It’s hard to explain without writing a novel but it doesn’t mean the vaccine will change your dna or stay in your body. </p>
<p>You posted the moderna report and posted one section but did you read the next part? It literally says it won’t change your dna. </p>
<p>“Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and could act as a source of side effects, mRNA-based medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell DNA; however, side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mRNA medicines despite the differences in mechanism. In addition, because no product in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient has been approved, the regulatory pathway for approval is uncertain. The number and design of the clinical trials and preclinical studies required for the approval of these types of medicines have not been established, may be different from those required for gene therapy products, or may require safety testing like gene therapy products. Moreover, the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly from one pharmaceutical product to the next, and may be difficult to predict.”</p>

        <p>Okay ignore that guy, just you and me man. So I understand the point of you saying its gene therapy, but... I would say any time you get an infection its gene therapy, because with any infection, whether it be infection or via vaccine exposure to mRNA or a weakened or killed form of the virus your body will make antibodies. So no matter how you get infected it'll affect your DNA somehow, all that matters is if you want the serious or potentially serious side affects from a natural infection where your body can't fight the infection with antibodies right away. Does that make any sense? Thanks for listening man :)</p>

<p>The difference is gene therapy is a term for the medical device you are injecting. Natural exposure to the virus that alters the dna could be called a mutation.</p>

        <p>mRNA is not transcribed into dna all the time. It’s just not the case. Reverse transcriptase exists with some viruses. That’s not the same as retrotransposons if that’s what you’re referring to. Telemorase has to do with cellular replication and isn’t converting mRNA into cDNA. </p>

        <p>Okay, so I read your articles, thank you for posting them, they were a good read. The first thing to say is that when it comes to drug tests, there will always be some differentiation in results as the animals are not human, that isn't saying that side affects that affect mammals won't happen in humans as well, but that's always the first thing to remember when developing drugs.</p>
<p>About the Liver damage article though, that is not the same type of vaccine as the COVID vaccine, it deals with rMVA vaccines, this is unrelated to mRNA vaccines, as they're created and operate in the body completely differently. Essentially with mRNA you give the body a dosage of mRNA which tells the body how to create an antibody to defeat a virus, this is important because it causes the body to go into defense mode and create antibodies just as a real infection would, that's why you get fevers and alike, as it allows the body more efficiently cells work better at higher temperatures and kill some infections. This is different from the rMVA vaccines in the paper, as this is taking a virus and making it infectious, historically, to avian animals, usually chickens. This is then introduced back into the body where it can no longer spread (hypothetically) allowing the body to kill it without the virus retaliating and create antibodies from its parts, preventing future prevention from the same virus but for humans. This runs into issues however, as described in the paper, as the virus has the possibility of mutating while inside the body and becoming harmful once again, this is what happened in the ferret paper. These results would not be consistent with the COVID vaccine, as stated the mRNA vaccine does not contain any virus that can mutate.</p>
<p>As for the first article, this is again talking about a similar difference between this SARS vaccine and the COVID vaccine. In this article it is examining lung damage dependent on what vaccine was given, going from dead viruses, to weakened viruses, to normal viruses. What they're saying here essentially is that lung damage was found in all mice dissected, however, and importantly, in all cases damage done was decreased by the virus when a vaccine was administered less with those with dead viruses, as it gave the body less to deal with. This would not be a problem with the mRNA vaccine, however, as it does not introduce a virus into the body. Yes if you receive a vaccine damage will be done to your lungs, but less damage will be done, as your body can respond with antibodies, but this is the case with any vaccine you receive. vaccines do not stop you from getting sick, instead it allows your body to respond and stop an infection almost immediately.</p>
<p>You can think about it like this, if your team is playing football against a team from the other side of the world, you have no idea what they're going to do once the game starts, so at the beginning they may get the better of you and damage will be done as they score and go ahead of you, but as the game progresses you learn their tactics and how they play and can defeat them and survive, but damage will be done, a few players may even be injured. That's your immune system fighting a virus with no help. With a vaccine when your body goes to fight, they've seen the other teams play book, their signals and signs, even footage of the other team playing. Little to no damage is done and your body easily defeats it because it knows the other teams ins and outs already.</p>
<p>If you have any other papers I'd love to read them, like I said I'm new here and just trying to figure out the different things on here, so thanks for interacting with me man, I appreciate it, God bless you man! :)</p>

        <p>Well, the way I see it right, let's assume the vaccine is effective and all that. If everyone got vaccinated, COVID would be gone, right? COVID has really affected me in the lockdown sense, so I am putting my grain of sand to contribute. For example, to go back to school, it's a lot easier if everyone is vaccinated. Also, since I am relatively young, there is ana greater risk of being asymptomatic as I understand it. If I were to be asymptomatic and infect a person, who then infects someone who dies, then I would in my opinion be responsible in a way. W/ the vaccine I have a much much lower chance of getting COVID and infecting someone. For my own health, I know that I most likely would not die or suffer any long-term effects, however, it is not a certainty. So I'd rather be safe than sorry in that way. Since I personally don't believe in all the fear around the vaccine, in a pro/con list of getting it the pros would be what I mentioned, and I don't really see any cons. I also potentially could be around some people who could likely die if they get covid, so am also protecting them. This is at least my line of thought, I hope you gained some insight, I tried to put my thoughts into words as best as possible but sometimes I have trouble doing so, hope this comment makes sense lol</p>

        <p>It makes sense in a weird way, because your logic is flawed.
First things first, covid didn't set up lockdowns. Our government did, which means covid won't lift lockdowns or bring us into normalcy by perishing either. Matter of fact, rich people have become even richer during this pandemic, which means it's not in their interest for this to ever end. Why wouldn't they find another reason a few months from now for more lockdowns, when they managed to make people lock themselves up for a virus with 99%+ survival rate? </p>
<p>There are many diseases out there that are dangerous for old and immuno-compromised people. We cannot and should not think about what happens to some random 90 year old stranger if they somehow get infected by the virus, because as I said, many things have probability as high as covid or dozen times higher than covid at killing them.</p>
<p>Also, there's not a single government that has ever cared about the health of its people. Pfizer alone spent billions of dollars in court fines and bribing doctors and experts, and they are still operating and are praised as heroes. Heroin was being sold as a cure for cough until people started waking up. Many examples out there. </p>
<p>And no, if everyone got vaccinated covid wouldn't disappear.</p>
<p>My line of thinking is very pessimistic, but that is how you have to think in order to get out of this hell. You cannot blame covid for mask mandates and lockdowns. You cannot think that vaccinating yourself would earn you your freedoms back. Liberty is easy to lose and very hard to attain.</p>

        <p>Haha as I was typing the lockdown thing I guessed you would reply something like that. Yes, it was a decision by the government, however, I can't really change their approach, so I am doing what I can so that they decide to "return to normal". As for your point after I really don't know what comes after, but so far at least I can sort of understand where they are coming from.</p>
<p>I do understand what you are saying, but if I can basically guarantee I won't get or spread the virus w/ no drawbacks to my person, why wouldn't I do it yknow?</p>
<p>I almost completely agree with this point, for example big pharma caused the opioid crisis and they do a lot of shady shit. However in my opinion this does not mean that they are unable to do something good you know? Especially because this also affects them. I also think most people working there the "grunts" who do the research and stuff are trying to help. The ones that are more interested in the profits and such are the very higher ups, the powerful ones. Also not sure about this but from what I recall since I am very interested in the topic of drugs, they didn't know heroin was that bad, at the time of discovery and popular use science was moving veryyy fast like never before, and regulation wasn't around because up to then it wasn't needed, they saw that heroin helps some conditions and started using it without knowing all the problems it would cause. However as I said not sure.</p>
<p>Why wouldn't COVID disappear? We eradicated smallpox with vaccines, why couldn't we do the same w/ COVID? The only thing I can think of rn is mutations and variants and such but Im sure you have a reason to believe that, so I would be very interested to hear that.</p>
<p>Im quite pessimistic in some things as well sometimes. as for your last point I def see where your logic is, and I agree and disagree at the same time, but can't put my thoughts on that into words, which is a problems I have sometimes. I also want to thank you for this civil discussion.</p>

        <p>&rt;let's assume the vaccine is effective and all that. If everyone got vaccinated, COVID would be gone, right?</p>
<p>This is the problem with your line of thinking. This assumption is  100% false. It is not safe or effective. It does not prevent infection, transmission or symptoms of Covid 19. It causes spikes in COVID deaths. It also causes death from vaccine side-effects. According the govt and vaccine companies, if we go along with their plan, we will be getting new shots with no safety trials every 6 months for the rest of our (probably drastically shortened) lives, and will never be able to end lockdowns or masks. Their plan makes no sense because it's not about health at all, it's about an ulterior agenda for totalitarian control of the human population.</p>

        <p>That not what actual studies are showing. Those opinions are backed by any actual data.

<p>As a summary, the vaccines prevent infection really well and if infected, you’d have a lower viral load meaning lower chance of spreading it. It was actually studied to show lower risk of major symptoms. </p>
<p>Where is the days showing increased COVID deaths or side effects?  276million doses given and COVID deaths declining. Also there were safety trials completed. 16weeks typically for vaccines. Pfizer will be fda approved within 6 months. They are waiting to make sure the vaccine works for over 1 year before they can apply for full approval.</p>

        <p>The “actual studies” are fraudulent, and even so still implicitly admit that the experimental injections do nothing they are purported to do. This is wildly misrepresented in public statements by the CDC, WHO and the media because all of them are 100% on board with the covert depopulation agenda.</p>

        <p>I’m not going to read that article for the simple fact it starts with a human right lawyer explaining to me a clinical study. </p>
<p>Just to be clear, you think multiple countries are supplying fake data to get a vaccine out to the population in order to kill them?  I don’t want to jump to any conclusions so I’m making sure that’s you’re interpretation of many clinical studies with overwhelming evidence. I’m going to go out on a limb and say you don’t have a strong understanding of science. </p>
<p>What would be the one thing to convince you the vaccines are effective at preventing COVID/spreading COVID?  Just wondering if any evidence would change your mind or it’s set in stone.</p>

        <p>Hello! You have made the mistake of writing "ect" instead of "etc."</p>
<p>"Ect" is a common misspelling of "etc," an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase "et cetera." Other abbreviated forms are <strong>etc.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c.</strong>, <strong>&amp;c</strong>, and <strong>et cet.</strong> The Latin translates as "et" to "and" + "cetera" to "the rest;" a literal translation to "and the rest" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase. </p>
