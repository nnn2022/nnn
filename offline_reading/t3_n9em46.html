    <strong>Why we are here</strong>
    <p><p>I just want to share some thoughts on why I (and I am sure other people on this sub) believe that this conversation needs to be had. I invite people who disagree to try to provide solid and reasonable arguments that we can debate.</p>
<p>After over a year of strict regulations, economic deterioration and limited freedom, we have around 3.3m unfortunate deaths from COVID19. While this is horrible, it is still a rather small number compared to several other societal issues. Around 7m die yearly from air pollution and 1.3 million from car accidents (WHO). This is but a fraction of the damage caused by climate change and things are getting worse. Surely, following the logic of COVID politics, we should immediately ban all personal vehicles running on gas?</p>
<p>There are many other similar arguments to be made. Approximately 5m children die from starvation yearly in Africa. The economic efforts needed to alleviate their situation would be negligible in comparison to the global hit that the economy has taken because of COVID restrictions. Starting to see the hypocrisy yet?</p>
<p>What’s worse, COVID has a definite solution in the shape of a vaccine which is already being administered, while many of these other societal issues have been around for decades or more. </p>
<p>The typical argument is usually “should we just let people die then?”. Most people do not die, there are 94.5m recovered, and most deaths occur in third-world countries with poor healthcare systems. Moreover, most countries do not even allow (ITS ILLEGAL) masks that have a protective filter to protect yourself. The mask is supposed to protect others. How about people from the risk group wearing masks with filters to protect themselves and let the rest of us go about life as usual?</p>
<p>Yes there are many problems in the world and we should work to solve them all, including pandemics. But how do you justify this exaggerated reaction towards a virus that is almost harmless to most of us when not even a fraction of the effort is made to combat war, natural disasters, famine, other illnesses, etc.?</p>
<p>It is clear that this is more than anything a political game that has gone out of control. The majority has had enough.</p></p>

        <p>The UN had to adjust their those at risk from famine last year from 135 million to 260 million due to the economic down turn cause by the world's COVID policies.</p>
<p>Unlike COVID, famine always comes for the young first.</p>
<p>When you have this many people at risk to famine just as many if not more die from regional conflicts that this kind of instability brings about.</p>
<p>Another way people die or whose lives are severely shortened is the malnutrition experienced for this who do not immediately die from famine. </p>
<p>Also when society breaks down due to famine routine medical visits are skipped, hygiene practices for food and water supplies are compromised, and disease runs rampant in refugee camps </p>
<p>Far more people will die from this than COVID. </p>
<p>This doesn't even include wealthy industrialized nations that have seen an increase in suicide, drug and alcohol abuse, violent crime (homicide is up 25% in the US from 2019 to 2020), missed medical appointments for terminal illnesses, ie missed chemo, cancer screenings, etc</p>

        <p>Precisely, however these issues do not allow social justice warriors who tweet from home and are too lazy to think further than what media feeds them to feel like heroes saving society because they wear a mask.</p>

        <p>The same people who have a BLM tag on their Twitter or Insta and talk about COVID equity, whatever the fuck that is </p>
<p>These 260 million people at risk to famine are overwhelmingly people of color.</p>
<p>They dont give two shits about peopleof color. They only care about the virtue signaling points. </p>
<p>I'm less white than our 44th President, but have been called a racist for pointing things like this out.</p>
<p>I like your point about the media making them feel like a hero for wearing a mask. Pretty much the same vibe for getting vaccinated or being the best at following the rules</p>

        <p>No, no, no. This was never about people dying. People were dying anyway. Death counts have been going up for years... Remember, there was a global population boom 80 years ago. Life expectancy is \~79. You know what that means, right?</p>
<p>It means not only did we have more deaths last year, and the year before, but you can expect more deaths for the next 20-25 years because that's about how long the population surge lasted.</p>
<p>No, this was all about an impending financial collapse and governments around the world using this opportunity to prepare for it.</p>
<p>They taught people to accept lockdowns, which are really for security purposes. They boosted the militarization of police forces (under the guise of defunding them.) They created an external threat that they can turn on and off which just happens to come around during flu season (which incidentally is when markets typically reveal problems -- September/October.)</p>
<p>The forced closure of business was a real life test to see what would happen with that many people being out of work, and created an opportunity to do limited UBI testing... To measure the inflationary effects both in terms of purchases and wage inflation.</p>
<p>That's what this was really about, and it's not over yet. They inflated the bubble after 2008, and they did this time, too. The crash was supposed to happen in September of 2019, but they took these measures instead because they know the next one is going to be BIG. Global.</p>
<p>It will require a global capitulation and reset of currencies.</p>
<p>You could even argue this was the right thing to do, since the amount of unrest can be not just destabilizing -- it could lead to the next World War.</p>
<p>Instead, what you see is global governments cooperating with one another to set up a plan to try to maintain stability when it happens. They're not doing it for us, remember - we are less like humans and more like cattle to them... They're doing it to protect themselves. Their wealth, their power. But we benefit as well because if a significant war occurs between large countries --- it's all over.</p>
<p>Don't take my words as a justification for these measures. I'm a "people-ist", not a "capitalist." That means I put people first, and this could have been handled in a more honest way. That said, when the people realize the crash is happening because of gross financial misconduct which led to a small number of people getting ALL the wealth at our expense... well... there will be revolt.</p>
<p>That's why we have Covid-19. To scare everyone into compliance. That's why we have race issues. To keep us divided.</p>
<p>And that's why we'll have the next thing to scare us when the actual collapse hits. Fear short-circuits logic and reason. Fear causes people to look to their leaders and they get in line. It's why Iraq supposedly had "weapons of mass destruction." It's why Dick Cheney appeared before the United States and said, "Attack [from Iraq] is imminent." It's why we had years of daily terror alerts. All to scare people into compliance with an unnecessary war.</p>
<p>If people would pay closer attention to history --- even their own --- they would see through what is happening today.</p>
<p>But the hypnotic power of screens is such that people are in the "now" and rarely consider perspective of the past in relation to what's happening today.</p>
<p>If you disagree with my assessment, I can't reply. I no longer have time to argue with people who can't see what is plain as day in front of their eyes. Covid-19 was an exaggerated threat to distract, divide, and provide cover &amp; give governments time to prepare for a financial crisis that will be <em>world changing</em> when it strikes.</p>

<p>This is excellent. I don't hear too many people asking a question like this. We know people all over the planet perish, and those numbers are sky high compared to covid deaths. But, you are 100% right about the low effort regarding every other life threatening issue.</p>
