    <strong>DAE have mixed feeling about just living life to the fullest and precaution, if it was a true pandemic?</strong>
    <p><p>Now we knows that COVID19 isn't as dangerous as first thought and to the vast majority it's just a flu. I've seen there have been a few discussions on this sub and some other subs on which laws you would support. Most of us agreed on that if it was a real pandemic, it wasn't necessary to enforce a law because of people would naturally take precaution themselves.</p>
<p>What I want to know is if anyone else have mixed feelings or are fence sitter when it comes to taking precautions yourself. Earlier, I've written about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/kbfly3/does_anyone_else_not_feel_at_home_anywhere/">how the lockdown/restrictions have affected my life quality</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LockdownSkepticism/comments/jheken/ive_choose_to_not_live_in_fear_my_thoughts/">that life is full of risks we can't control</a> and that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jhgxaa/rantconfession_im_peace_with_dying_of_covid19_but/">I'm peace with risking dying/getting hospitalized for COVID19</a>, if that meant we could live normally.</p>
<p>It's easy for me as a young college student without any underlying health conditions to say. If it was Ebola, the 1918 flu or similar, I would honestly sit on the fence. At one side, I want to live longer and don't want to die or my family members and friends die. So, in that way I lean toward taking precaution myself. At the same time, I don't want to live a boring and depressive life. I think life quality is important and that not only life quantity matters. A shorter fun life may be better than a long boring one. I also don't believe in an afterlife.</p>
<p>Often when I goes outside, I see almost everyone wearing facial covering which reminds me about dystopian fiction and some other authoritarian places in the world. It's not voluntary. It's based on fear, government/state control and is a constant reminder of social distancing, the businesses and schools getting closed. It's a mandate. It's a messed up dystopia, because of it hides facial expressions, is dehumanizing and make people treat each other as disease vectors instead of people.</p>
<p>Often when being outside, I think that I only wants to live a life worth living. A fun and enjoyable life. And living normally. I don't want to die and I'm not suicidal. Sometimes I just think it would've been better if I just risked dying or getting hospitalized, if the virus truly was bad. In many ways it seems more temping dying or getting hospitalized as a free person, than being "safe", oppressed and depressed. I don't think the lockdown or restrictions worked now and I'm fully aware of COVID19 isn't dangerous. But I'm speaking of a hypothetical scenario if a virus was more dangerous and if precaution had an effect.</p>
<p>(That doesn't mean I wouldn't do any pros vs cons. If it was something that could've prevented me from doing what I loved like doing visual art because of it caused blindness, I would act differently than if it was just a more risky version of COVID19)</p>
<p><strong>I'm basically a fence sitter on if I would live normally and risk dying/getting hospitalized or take precaution, but life would be boring and full of self-imposed restrictions - if a true pandemic happen.</strong></p></p>
