    <strong>The politicans and elite are already showing their true selves by getting the vaccine first before people that are in much more need this is just EXTREME SELFISHNESS!!!</strong>
    <p><p>They just said our queen have gotten the vaccine. She is old and can easily stay at home and not see people for a year if she wanted. Meanwhile back in April essential workers had to be at her garden to fix stuff. Totally non essiential.</p>
<p>Meanwhile people at 67 with diabetes and other risk are still forced to work in grocery stores with no vaccine planned the coming months.</p>
<p>The same with Biden he just tricked people to thinking him getting the vaccine was okay because then he could prove to the anti maskers it's safe competely forggting that taking a vaccine at age 78 is entirely diffrent than taking a vaccine aged 20.</p>
<p>A true leader would wait until the last citizen have gotten the vaccine to take the vaccine himself or herself.</p>
<p>I hope this can show the doomers that the goverment is not on our side!!!!</p></p>

        <p>They aint taking the vaccine. I saw a video (cant find it anymore) where they were showing our front line doctors getting the shot. He got poked by the needle. But the syringe itself was empty. It wasent even drawn back. Like it was just empty with a needle on it. And on fucking live tv (local to someplace forgot where but was east coast) the doc got poked with an empty syringe and the nurse faked the movements of injecting something. Went something like (paraphrasing) 'it was brought to out attention by one of our viewers that one of the vaccine shots we showed yesterday showed no vaccine being delivered. We reached out to the hospital and they said all who were supposed to get the vaccine got it' it was right in my damn face on how fucking fake that was. Wish i could still find the video. But my dude. These same people lied from the beginning 'wear masks' 'dont wear masks'.....if ur frind kept lying to you, why would you still believe him? And i just gave an example i saw with my own 2 eyes. </p>
<p>They aint taking the vaccine. Its ment to lie to us more</p>
