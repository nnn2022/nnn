        <p>God this is just fucking disgusting.</p>
<p>I'm sorry but if you actually think this is fine just because kids could give it to their parents or some stupid BS excuse then please just stop. Hand washing and telling kids to cover their mouth/nose when they cough/sneeze is good enough to help """"stop spread"""" or whatever retarded goalpost is going to be moved in the future. IDC if this is for their """"safety""""" or not, this is fucking creepy as hell and they all look so dead inside.</p>
<p>And maybe we should actually look at the numbers and see that children are barely effected by the virus and not stupid BS like this that passes as """"""sCiEnCe""""""""".</p>

        <p>This is soul crushing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The thing I want most in this world is a family, and the state of everything right now is making me seriously consider getting my tubes tied for the first time in my life. I loved school as a kid. This was my favorite time of year, early August when you're starting to get excited about going back and you start getting the Back to School supplies lists, etc... Like, I massively LOVED school. And I'm not talking high school, middle school... I'm talking elementary. You know. Some of the most crucial years in a student's life. I'm still good friends with my elementary school friends. We still remember when each other's birthday is for crying out loud. It's this really special bond that you create at such a young age, and it's truly a remarkable and beautiful thing when you still have it for years to come... The fact that kids can't even hug each other now or sit with each other at lunch and laugh and smile together--I'm actually tearing up right now typing this. I don't get how more people aren't upset. Do you know how many viruses and colds run through school anyway? And how come no one is talking about the Chicken Pox? Pink Eye? Lice?</p>
<p>First it's no more celebrating holidays. No more in school holiday parties, no Halloween parade because 9/11 changed that-- now we're going to make everyone sign into every school and there will be tight security because of all of the school shootings, maybe even have some security at the door and a man with a gun. Next it's Common Core. Take away all of the creativity, all of the fun school projects, it's going to be a "one size fits all" now when it comes to learning and schools, make it easy, make it the machine. Then math is taught a completely different way. Never mind that it makes no sense, it's almost more work now, and when it comes to students with special needs it's even that much more difficult now. And now it's... this?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's a really tough argument, and I get the paranoia and worries from the parents' side and the more elder and compromised teachers and staff, sure. But I've said this for a while now: This disease that apparently affects kids the least is going to end up affecting them the worst. And it's not going to be because of any "physical" health reason... </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>My heart truly breaks over all of this. And I don't know what the number one answer is. This is a rant. I'm emotional and have been drinking and was just at my cousin's high school graduation get together earlier. It's just all too real.</p>
