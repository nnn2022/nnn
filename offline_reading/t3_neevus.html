    <strong>First dose Pfizer</strong>
    <p><p>Got it yesterday, a little sore in my upper arm, but no other side effects. I will update this post if anything changes. I did get the full list of ingredients and the preservative to which I am allergic wasn't there.</p>
<p>I am morally opposed to vaccine mandates so you can bet that I'm keeping my little certificate to myself and will only be pulling it out when it's time for the second shot in September. </p>
<p>The funny thing is that this changes absolutely nothing we're still in full lockdown. Mask mandate in any public business (open air or not) and I'm still not allowed to have my family over to my own house (bet that that law is being ignored), but no problem having a plumber over this morning to look at a rework for an ugly/tired, but completely functional bathroom. He will probably see 12 or so other houses between now and when he would start to show symptoms if he were sick, but hey this is how we're going to beat this thing amirite?</p></p>

        <p>I got the j&amp;j shot 10 days ago. Hell if I'm going show my card or answer questions from any ordinary business about my health status. I don't know yet how I'll answer if my employer asks.   </p>
<p>Oh, from the shot, no arm soreness or any distinct symptoms. But I was unusually tired for about 4 days afterwards.</p>

        <p>It’s probably for the best that you got the vaccine. I really just hate the push to force people into it. Still am not sure if the fda has approved any and was told you shouldn’t receive them if you have any extreme allergies, but hell what do I know every article  I read usually has a doppelgänger article contradicting it.</p>

        <p>I too hate the push to force people into it. The very first humans to be injected with it were given their doses less than six months ago this means we have zero data about what this does in people or even really how long it provides immunity. </p>
<p>It's free and it's unlikely to cause me any problems and it seems to provide some protection. </p>
<p>FDA has approved under emergency provisions which is not the same as being able to confidently say it's safe and effective. Hell they have to tell us everytime there's a new variant whether the vaccine works. There's also a bunch of side effects they don't really know about (thinking mainly of the menstruation issues). For someone with a otherwise healthy profile and low risk of covid complications I can totally understand why they might not want to have the vaccine and I don't think we should be forcing it on people I think that's deeply immoral.</p>

        <p>This sub isn't anti-vax as the term is used per se, it's more about the pursuit of liberty and truth, but in that pursuit most people have learned, through continued research, that the vaccine is in no way needed when there are already safe, effective treatments available, like ivermectin, or that the positive case rates were inflated due to high cycle thresholds of the PCR tests, or how around 95% of claimed covid deaths had on average 4 other co-morbidities, along with countless other reasons that lead people to believe there is nothing good to come from getting vaccinated for covid.</p>

        <p>I'm confused why you jumped in to tell me something I already know as if my post in any way suggested that other people should go out and get it. There's a ton of people posting and lurking that are having trouble deciding whether to get it or not. There are a ton of posts in this sub highlighting the worst reactions to the vaccines, but in the overwhelming majority of cases, people get it and are completely fine.</p>
<p>I thought my post was fair, and highlighted that I'm still with the rest of you who have made a different choice than me that I'm not going to lay down and let your rights be trampled because I made a decision in-line with the majority. </p>
<p>The thread you're replying to told me I'm in the wrong sub. Unless they've changed the description since I joined a month ago, that isn't the case. It's not projection for me to pay attention to where you responded to my post.</p>

        <p>Same, I got the shot, I really think it’s a fake vaccine, but I’m extremely morally against people being pressured to get it, so I’m definitely keeping my mouth shut and card hidden. I’ve had both doses already and had slight soreness in my arm the first dose, but not the 2nd and no side effects at all, not even tiredness.</p>
