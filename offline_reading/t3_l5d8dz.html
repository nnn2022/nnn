    <strong>Some doomer idiot literally started a fight with me last night because I wasn’t wearing a mask outdoors in an empty parking lot.</strong>
    <p><p>Some background. I got in fights a lot when I was young, but never got formally trained in MMA or boxing or whatever. Got my ass beat a few times, gave it back a few times, you know how it is. All street fight junk where two dudes just swing wildly until someone goes down and the boys pull the winner off of the loser. I’ve been on both sides of it. </p>
<p>I do go to a local boxing gym, but it’s mainly for cardio and fun. I’m not there to legitimately learn how to fight people. I’m also not at all a Trump guy (more on this later), and I haven’t taken a real swing on someone in about 20 years (I’m almost 40). As for size and weight, I’m a very big dude. Back when I struggled with depression and legitimately wanted to kill myself, at rock bottom I was 458 pounds. I got down below 300 before pandemic pounds happened. Got back up to 330, but then gyms opened again in my state. At present, I’m 6 foot 1 and 315. </p>
<p>Basically, if you don’t know what you’re doing you’d have to be an idiot to just come up to me for no reason. I’m not a pro fighter or anything, but against someone who knows nothing they have no chance. So I’m leaving a chiropractor appointment last night, and in there I mask up because why not. I’m not going to disrespect people I legitimately enjoy. I get outside, take the mask off, and walk to my car. </p>
<p>Some moron comes flying out of his Audi SUV screaming at me to put my mask on. This dude was in his 50s, white, couldn’t have been taller than 5 foot 8, couldn’t have weighed more than 160, and had fuckin loafers on with socks in the winter. Like I immediately knew the dude was softer than a chinchilla hat. He was also <em>so mad</em> that it was comical, and I legit started laughing at him.</p>
<p>“Bro are you actually being serious? Is this one of those hidden camera Youtube skits?”</p>
<p>“NO, FUCK YOU AND PUT YOUR MASK ON BEFORE YOU KILL PEOPLE!”</p>
<p>Then he actually takes a swing, all arm and with no hip form whatsoever. Blocked his sorry attempt at a “punch” (I hesitate to even call it a punch), and I’m like “bro, I’m giving you one fair warning to knock it off, you know nothing about me and you could get seriously hurt”. </p>
<p>And the fucking idiot actually swung again with his laughable form while screaming at me. So I kicked him in the nuts as hard as I possibly could, which caused him to keel over and protect his crotch with both hands. Free head shot. Took it, knocked him out, then left once he started stirring again. Like.... the fuck are you doing, bro? Half my size and he starts up some stupid shit like this.</p>
<p>The dude was either mentally ill, <em>high as fuck</em>, or some libtard jackoff who saw me in a red shirt, assumed I was some Trump stan, and thought it gave him a free pass to act like the idiots on the internet because his overlords all promote this type of behavior. Like I’m not a Trump dude and I wear a mask indoors, but we were literally in an empty parking lot. </p>
<p>People have lost their damn minds.</p></p>
