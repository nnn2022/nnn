    <strong>Help waking a loved one?</strong>
    <p><p>I think I want to attempt to 'wake' my SO on this issue if possible. I never bothered cause I don't like forcing beliefs (That's the difference between doomers and us) but he keeps making sure my muzzle..mask is all the way up when we are out together and it was.. Im glad we dont go out together much or all the time. Im glad I shop alone now.<br>
If someone else woke you up, what was the thing they said that made it click? I need help. Ive been trying to drop pills along the way about how this was planned but he still thinks this was a coincidence that there was talks about pandemics a year ago.</p></p>

        <p>Stop with the “planned” angle ... honestly, that’s super conspiracy theory and there’s no hard proof. This argument is unnecessary. </p>
<p>Show him the actual studies on masks (you can find plenty here and in lds). </p>
<p>Show him the CDC IFRs. </p>
<p>Show him numbers that put covid deaths in context: daily global death rate as a normal matter of course (150,000 deaths), deaths from cancer/heart attacks/etc, covid deaths by age (almost all over 70, with most of those over 80), percentage of covid deaths that were from nursing homes (and avg life expectancy of a nursing home resident without covid). </p>
<p>Show him data on other viral infections and the damage they can cause (very long recovery times, myocarditis, kidney damage + triggered diabetes, lung damage) to demonstrate that these things are in no way unique to covid and he’s lived with viruses that cause these things all his life. </p>
<p>Stick to source data, studies, and articles in scientific/medical publications (no mainstream media). </p>
<p>Of course, this all depends on him actually caring about facts.</p>

        <p>Try telling the mask police that. They will respond with , "it's not 100% effective but even if it saves 1 life your a piece of shit for pointing out facts!". -literally had someone tell me this when I brought that up.</p>

        <p>Our public health Dick Tater is weaving a similar web of stories about how 'outbreaks' start. There are several new outbreaks in nursing homes here and there was no direct statement that employees weren't wearing masks- enough, but he insinuated it " He noted that limited mask-wearing appears to have fueled those  outbreaks, given the “stark difference” in other “similar situations”  where participants did wear them.  "--- That's called journalism these days smh.</p>
<p>It's really frustrating because 'sentinel events' where patients die due to error in hospital, dwarf deaths from corona in my state, and looking at the data, it doesn't seem to include deaths from antibiotic resistant infections acquired in the hospital, nor does it include deaths from errors in nursing homes. </p>
<p>Data is being scrubbed from the public health website due to 'redesign', so the only available numbers are the lowest, which still put the death toll from medical error higher than the virus.</p>
<p>Point is, while acting like furious nannys to us, public health operates incompetently with impunity and slaughter scores of people, masks or no.</p>

        <p>Is your SO a numbers person? Try Ethical Skeptic on twitter. Very clean, beautiful and professional data analysis and charts. (Which I, unfortunately, am too math illiterate to fully understand, but I enjoy reading it nonetheless.)</p>

        <p>Thanks. Ill check it out. Yes, I think its quite hard for the layperson to read such things that's why they are able to get away with so much. I am also math illiterate.</p>
