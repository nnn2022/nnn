    <strong>When did it become my responsibility to protect EVERY SINGLE PERSON?</strong>
    <p><p>Remember the good old days when others understood that humans aren't built to die on the hill of every single person's possible struggle - including medical disadvantages? What a luxury!</p>
<p>I have recently been completely berated, belittled and shamed by a (previous) good friend of mine for not being conscious of all the non-vaxed, compromised people who have had 5 organ transplants, countless autoimmune diseases, so on and so forth, who I could be encountering out in the world when I am not masking and not vaxed myself.</p>
<p>I'm sure you rational people are thinking – well it's the responsibility of THOSE people to protect themselves so maybe THEY shouldn't BE out and about – but it doesn't stop there! Because– what about their friends and family who are out and about? (ignore that they are healthy and vaxed, of course). I could pass covid to THEM and then THEY could bring it to their sick loved one. Again, you might say "well if it was really a concern to them, they should be masking up, or not going out," right? But nope. It's apparently MY responsibility to play it safe FOR them, so please, allow ME to wear a mask for EVERYONE ELSE'S SAKE.</p>
<p>I absolutely detest this notion that everyone else's quality of life is more important than your own, so we must all potentially risk our health by getting vaxed for the sake of others – and if not that, then we at least have to muzzle ourselves to eternity.</p>
<p>Not to mention, my best friend is one of these people who have a myriad of rare, chronic and incurable diseases. She will tell you herself that covid is at the very bottom of her mind. I still am conscientious of her health, but I can't and don't accept things like a vaccine that I am terrified of for the sake of her and others. Just as I would never ask or expect her to take a certain medicine or introduce something into her body for MY sake. That's just not the way it should work!!!!!</p></p>

        <p>Just like they don't care about the 9 million people per year who die of hunger.  They only care about using emotional manipulation and shame to control people.  They don't give two squirts about actually helping anyone but themselves.  Yet, somehow we're the selfish ones.</p>

        <p>People, including myself, are incredibly selfish.</p>
<p>People in USA, UK, Japan, Canada live extravagant lives.
For instance if they got rid of their car and instead got a bus to work, they could likely save $300 per month. Enough to stop a family starving to death. Nobody really cares because we earned it and can spend it.</p>
<p>We pick and choose which causes we want to get behind arbitrarily. Covid certainly isn't worth paying any attention to, I'm shocked that people find it to be such a big deal.</p>

        <p>I was thinking of an encounter I had last week with someone who tried to guilt and shame me when I visited my old workplace and took off my mask; nobody else wore one so why should I? Told a story where I disclosed being unvaxed and it was like I just duped them all to enter the gas chamber.</p>
<p>So here's what I was thinking about: Back when I was little, I got a small number of vaccinations. Nowadays, kids get like 5x as many for all sorts of things. I never got a booster to get those vaccinations. I think I've only gotten a TB shot and a tetanus shot in my adulthood, as I imagine this guy did, too.</p>
<p>Why isn't he running out to get all the shots that every younger person has now? Doesn't he care about them?</p>

        <p>I would not ask or expect the world to change for me. I am already a part of a minority group, so I know what it’s like to accept that my needs and experiences are not prioritized, and most of the time go completely unacknowledged. But I don’t care. I understand the reality of it, the human nature. Plus - if I was chronically ill, I’d likely be more concerned over my everyday ailments my diseases cause versus Covid.</p>
