    <strong>I have genuine questions that I’m not sure I’ve seen anyone who is against the vaccine talk about</strong>
    <p><p>Why do you believe that the government is trying to kill its people? Financially does it make sense to kill off your workers and consumers? And all of the big corporations that are going to soon mandate vaccines from their employees.. why would they also put their workers in danger? We all know that the government is corrupt and that they’re just bought off the big companies. They are begging millennials to have children because we need workers. And also.. if they were trying to kill people wouldn’t it make more sense to kill off those who don’t just blindly follow the government? Wouldn’t they want to keep around those who are “sheep” because they’re more easily controlled? </p>
<p>I can’t imagine that these giant multi-billion dollar companies would risk losing a huge chunk of workers/consumers. </p>
<p>It could be to make us sicker, they already put stuff in our food that isn’t good for us and of course it benefits the insurance companies. But it seems like once the vaccine gets full FDA approval it’ll be very likely that insurance companies will push for vaccinations to lower their costs, and those who don’t get vaccinated might get higher premiums. But also, countries with free healthcare are getting the vaccine.. like Canada who is also using Pfizer, Moderna, and J&amp;J. So the vaccine making us sicker will also cost companies more, which again I can’t see why they would do that since money is everything. </p>
<p>They can already track us with our phones and listen in on us if they wanted to. So what’s the endgame here ?</p>
<p>Edit: I’m not sure why the post is getting downvoted. It’s something I’ve been thinking about recently and haven’t seen people really talk about when they talk about not getting the vaccine. I’m being perfectly respectful and even though I don’t agree with you guys, I came here to get answers from the very people that have these beliefs.</p></p>

        <p>Who knows what the reason is, it really doesn't matter honestly. Once you see them lying about cases, deaths, masks, natural immunity, other off-label drugs.. You don't need to know their alternative purpose to know there <em>is</em> an alternative purpose</p>

        <p>I lean towards this answer.  I’m dismissive of conspiracy theories in general and find the vast majority are just plain wacky.  But when people sense they are being fed deception and lies, they are left to speculate about the truth, and some people have some rather exciting imaginations.  And the other problem is that people watch too much tv and think they understand geopolitical events because they watched game of thrones.  </p>
<p>With that said, if history has shown us anything, it is that evil is very real and people and institutions can be murderous beyond belief.  Later generations always wonder how such atrocities happen, but one way is for the people of the time to refuse to consider that homicidal intentions are a possibility.  While I see the issue the way OP does, there are some powerful people who publicly advocate for population reduction. And many others who think humans are a cancer on the planet, so who knows what is driving all of this.  But if anything is possible, might as well consider all the possibilities.</p>

        <p>If there IS a solid political move aside from the obvious bucks all the politicians are making from being heavily invested in pharmaceutical stocks, I think this would be it.</p>
<p>I think the long game would be to establish something like China's Social Credit system.</p>
<p>I'm not taking the jab because I understand statistics and believe it's just dangerous as fuck to inject an untested, experimental drug into your system.  I wouldn't do SARMS in the same way haha.</p>
<p>Also, OP, no one is losing money here. The vaccine isn't currently making anyone sicker right away, but unexpected dangers could come a decade from now because there were no trials to predict long-term results, and the taxpayer is paying for "free" healthcare (and the vaccine) in those countries. The government isn't TRYING to kill us or make us sicker with the vaccine. It's simply trying to use it as a control mechanism and is already using it to make a quick buck from the taxpayer.</p>

        <p>Let's not generalize.</p>
<p>I, for one, don't believe that our government is trying to kill us all. </p>
<p>I do firmly believe that there are wealthy and influential people that have our government by the balls, that believe population is a global issue, and them, themselves, wish to depopulate.</p>
<p>For me, whether Covid was planned or an accident, either way, it provided an exploitable opportunity. Whether the goal is depopulation, who knows, we'll find out in time. </p>
<p>But one thing is clear, the vaccines arent humanitarian, they fit into the 2030 Agenda some how, and there's huge financial gains being had.</p>
<p>So, at a minimum, there is global corruption happening at the cost of tax paying citizens, by a government controlled by wealthy, to undermine American Democracy.</p>

        <p>Because this government has a two hundred year track record of proving that it exists solely on the back of the corpses it creates. </p>
<p>A better question is, after all they've done to display that they don't deserve it, why do you trust the government? Literally not a single government has ever proven themselves worthy of trust, and those who choose to give that trust are naive and gullible. </p>
<p>Tell me... When a stranger offers you something to take which you know nothing about, do you trust them and take it? Probably not. Why would you give government any more leeway than a stranger on the street?</p>

        <p>It depends on how much tinfoil you want in your hat.</p>
<p>The loonies believe there's some kind of global conspiracy to depopulate the world for ecological or government control reasons. These theories are of course nonsense: we've always had "new world order" conspiracy theories, and COVID just provides a convenient attachment point for the old thinking.</p>
<p>Reasonable lockdown and vaccine skeptics don't think the expert class is literally <em>trying</em> to kill people. Reasonable skeptics believe that people running the vaccine and lockdown pushes genuinely believe that they're doing good. The problem is that these experts and policy-makers have worked themselves into a corner with propaganda, censorship, and authoritarianism: if it turns out that vaccines and lockdowns <em>aren't</em> the answer to COVID after all, the people who've spent the past 18 months pushing them stand to lose a tremendous amount of face, power, influence, and credibility. The vaccines <em>have</em> to work, because if they didn't --- or worse, if the vaccines actually hurt people --- the entire expert class would suffer total disgrace. That's unthinkable. </p>
<p>I don't think most experts even consciously understands that they're operating under this incentive structure. It's not even a "conspiracy": motivated reasoning is a hell of a drug. The experts simply discount theories that would lead to their having to admit fault. It's <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=565">crimestop</a>. They <em>really believe</em> that censoring social media, distorting the public conversation, imprisoning protesters, and mandating vaccination is doing good for the world, and that's because deep down they know that if they're wrong, it will be the end of their careers.</p>
<p>Going one level down in society: the useful idiots on social media don't care about vaccine effectiveness or COVID at all, not really. They just have authoritarian impulses and an excuse for acting them out. There's a jackboot tyrant deep inside the hearts of most people, and under the right circumstances, it can get out.</p>

        <p>This is well put.  </p>
<p>There also seems to be a level of institutional blindness, where the public health agencies are  quite enamored with vaccines (after all, vaccines do seem to be quite the beneficial tool for some issues) and seem to have decided in a groupthink fashion very early that the way out was a vaccine - and further, that the circumstances appeared so dire initially that it was worth rolling out this promising new mrna tech. The problem is the decision to pursue this course came early.  Perhaps prematurely early.  I mean, vaccine trials started in April, literally three months after covid was recognized as a thing. That is QUICK.  And given what has come to light about the amount of money committed to the vaccines (billions) and the need for both an ongoing emergency and the lack of an alternative effective treatment, in order to move forward with a mass vaccination (which most truly believe to be the bhe best and only way to defeat the pandemic) then a lot things start to make sense.  It also turns out the vaccine contracts are extremely heavy handed, such that vaccine makers are the only ones getting true immunity from the vaccines.  And their is also the increased concern that the FDA and CDC and NIH are too cozy with big pharma and that their is real corruption - such that those organizations have been characterized for years with terms like “incestuous” and “captured” and “political”</p>

        <p>Killing certain people off is cheaper for governments. If we get rid of a bunch of unhealthy disabled vulnerable and especially elderly people it’s much much cheaper for a government. I know in the UK for example they do not even want to treat those over 70 and those in care homes are asked almost immediately to sign a do not resuscitate order when they arrive.</p>

        <p>Event 201 was a “what if” Strategic planning conference sponsored by the Gates foundation. They talked medical, logistics and many other things if an pandemic broke out. This was three months before Covid-19. It’s not some conspiracy theory you can find it on YouTube on the NIH channel I believe. There have been many other planning events.</p>
<p>I believe that they found it to be in favor of to have a pandemic to financially benefit many corporations. It’s spun out of controls and they don’t know how to real it back in. </p>
<p>At first the Democrats where saying it’s nothings. There is footage of the parties leaders saying get out and go to China town and do social things. Now the republicans are the ones suffering when they say it. </p>
<p>The fear and Intimidation is big business In Politics. Not just the US but globally. </p>
<p>They may not be trying to kill us. But the leaders of the US know what to say and when to say. They will leave it up To the population to formulate conclusions. Since we are a divided nation we will continue with one being right and one being wrong.</p>

        <p>I would argue that pandemic preparedness is just asome thing that is needed especially with the increase is antibiotic resistance and such, we always knew a pandemic would happen it was really just a matter of when. And a lot of companies suffered last year, Amazon sure didn’t but we saw huge corporations like the NFL and AMC have to shut down which cost them millions. But I do agree that they have certainly divided us successfully!</p>

        <p>I think the issue here is that you’re thinking on a country level vs. a world level. Sure you may be killing off some of your own followers along the way but if it gets you closer to having one world power then so be it. They think of us normal folk as nothing more than cattle taking up space and natural resources. The elite’s lives will change very little if their plan succeeds. The US is the last bastion of freedom. The only thing holding back the New world order is the free people of the US. I read a theory on this Reddit stating that they want everyone to be vaccinated to be able to hide the vaccine related deaths. If everyone is vaccinated you can no longer see the control group. If there continues to be two distinct groups the effects of the vaccine will be obvious and sow more distrust in the government and the world health organization. This will completely destroy their agenda which is why I think they are pushing so hard for mandatory vaccines. </p>
<p>As far as getting rid of the working class and no longer having workers, not all become sterile and not all die. Life always finds a way, but the difference will be the new life will be raised in tyranny and conditioned exactly how they want them to be.</p>

        <p>Perhaps they really do think they can slow boil us into compliance, so eventually they’ll get what they want. Along these same lines, since they’re not seeing the level of shot compliance they anticipated, they’re turning up the dial quickly, which is why we’ve seen rhetoric from the media increase dramatically in just the past couple weeks.</p>

        <p>First off it’s not a vaccine it’s an experimental injection that hasn’t been approved by the FDA. One of the scientists (currently being deleted from science literature for his stance) that discovered/created MrDNA is very skeptical that it actually works and is against using it on humans because the animal trials were a disaster and we don’t know the long term effects of altering DNA. The “vaccine” doesn’t stop you from getting covid. It doesn’t stop You from transmitting covid. It supposedly lessons the effects, but even that is arguable. I trust my immune system to work more than I trust the government. Especially when they started censoring anyone who speaks out about the drug or offers alternative treatments/beliefs. </p>
<p>With that said I absolutely don’t trust the government to act and make choices in my best interests. They have a very long history of lying/deceiving and fear mongering to gain more control over the population. Just look at the patriot act. </p>
<p>In summary I made my choice from analyzing facts and history and not out of fear.</p>

        <p>It's really simple. Once you read more about the elites, you know that the whole blood line controls 75% of the wealth globally. Media wants you to think elon Musk and Jeff Bezos being the richest man. Give me a break. If you read more about the Rothschild, that man Mayer Rothschild had managed to control the money flow by putting each son in each key place in Europe. </p>
<p>It's said that their wealths have diminished, I do not believe it, I think it dispersed and they are just merely hiding behind the spotlight.</p>
<p>Many humans were required to build these things that you see today, in big cities, trains, networks. Right now they are useless eaters. The elite controls the federal reserves. The government that you see are just puppets run by them.</p>
<p>It's time to purge the useless eaters. Start by culling the easier ones. Soon, there will be smart cities and those who do not comply will be forced out of the smart cities.</p>
<p>Further, my theory is that they will try a crisis like this every decade. This pandemic, will at least shape the world somehow, even if vaccines aren't mandated. At least some kind of social id is seen normal. They think it's okay, try next time since they have many generations to spare, not us though. The next checkpoint will be harder to overcome.</p>

        <p>I think there are layers to it. Lower level businesses and companies that are doing it are just following suit of the bigger ones, because it’s “the right thing to do” or displays their allegiance to doing what is deemed politically correct. The higher up that chain you go to larger and larger establishments/ corporations, I fully believe there is money involved and personal interest. At the end of the day it boils down to how long can the machine extend the fear and keep this thing going. This entire scenario is a governments wet dream.</p>

        <p>There is no endgame here to seize control and/or get rid of some. Vaccines won't emmit 5G and they weren't designed to kill. BUT people in power are clueless and just started doing "something". I don't think it was their plan all along, but now they're unable to give back the powers gained. It is now a mix of hysteria, incompetenceness, greed for power and money (for the pharma)</p>

        <p>First, nobody is begging millennials to have babies. I find it to be quiet the opposite, we are told to think of the environment and don't put future generations through the climate catastrophe that is going to happen. </p>
<p>Governments have been known to test things on their population. That is an undisputable fact. Some governments have even gone out of their way to kill large swaths of their population but that usually falls under a dictator like Stalin or Pol pot. </p>
<p>There are governments that have also instituted compulsory sterilization and one of which is my country of Canada. We did compulsory sterilization through the 1920s ending in the 1970s. This country forcibly sterilized women so they couldn't have babies, how fucked up is that?</p>
<p>I don't believe that governments are trying to kill their population and I don't believe that they are inherently trying to make their population sick I also don't believe the governments are trying to sterilize the population. Those are just too big and too crazy. Governments attack or experiment on a small group of a population not the population at large. The government would risk being overrun by the population at large if they knew they were all under attack.</p>
<p><strong><em>So what could it be then?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well we know that the pharmaceutical companies have the government's over a barrel with the contracts. The government have to push the vaccines and they have to defend them at all costs. They have performance markers they have to hit and there is no sending product back to the pharma companies because there is a zero return policy. These products have to get used or they go in the garbage.
So I think the government is just doing what they have to do to live up to the horrendous contract that they signed.</p>
<p><strong><em>So if not the government then who?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well its not out of the realm of possibility that a pharmaceutical company would want to somehow get a repeat customer base. It's also not out of the realm of possibility that they used an already existing product that was sitting on the shelf collecting dust and added a few tweaks and sent it out to not only recoup some of their vast R&amp;D losses but to make a staggering profit. All of the other mRNA vaccines failed miserably and killed everything before this one. </p>
<p>So could Pfizer and the other pharmaceutical companies want to make people sick? It's possible but I doubt it. I don't believe they planned on making our immune systems a subscriber model but if it happened I can see them jumping on the opportunity to profit off of it.</p>
<p>I just think they made a bad vaccine and we are stuck with it.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about global elites in a shadowy room?</em></strong></p>
<p>Well this is honestly plausible too. How many people do you need to have in on a massive global conspiracy? The answer is actually only a couple. If Bill Gates and Karl Schwab for example had a meeting and discussed that climate change was bad and the great reset needed to happen they could then orchestrate a plan that compartmentalizes everything enough so nobody knows anything just that they were following a small seemingly innocent set of instructions. This way a really bad thing happens and nobody knows that they are the ones participating in it. </p>
<p>I'm not saying that's happening but stranger things have happened in this world. How many movies have there been about a few people trying to depopulate the Earth for Earth's sake? If life is stranger than fiction and we get a lot of that in fiction then who knows what's possible.</p>

        <p>Sounds like you answered your own question in the last paragraph. If everyone gets sicker and has to rely on healthcare or "free healthcare" where do you think that money comes from?</p>
<p>Law abiding tax payers</p>
<p>And once people don't have a leg to stand on they get government assistance and have to follow the agenda or lose access to social systems. Thus, the social credit system that already exists in China aka Sesame Score or Zhima Credit.</p>
<p>Tie it in with the vaccine passport and Quantum Dot Tattoos and you have the foundation for the Certificate Of Vaccination IDentification realized before Covid even kicked off via the "Covid Credentials Initiative" or "Crimson Contagion" or "Event 201" or many of the other programs detailing the future so perfectly.</p>

        <p>Yeah, OP isn't aware of many things that you touched upon and other many things.</p>
<p>For example, the whole world to function like we know it it requires <em>energy.</em> </p>
<p>Energy was produced like you said in ancient times by we doing the hard work.</p>
<p>We transitioned in history with each step to more advanced ways of producing and using energy to machinery run by fuel energy.</p>
<p>The idea is now we have devices that produce that energy from almost nothing. The "free-energy" devices that were so suppressed. They don't need millions of people to build and run those devices.</p>

<p>The same thing had happened for generations,. You kear t from the elders how to stay alive </p>
<p>She said " empire could do anything it liked and it couldn't touch us,. We always had food on the table"</p>
<p>Then she said she had Kids and then when they were teens the 60s came along and they didn't want to learn how to grow food or make butter etcz. Instead they worse mini skirts and took drugs</p>
<p>" They never became adults,. And now you are 4th generation child,. Unable to look after himself "</p>

        <p>Think of it simply. </p>
<p>Humans are organized by nature. We organized by race, country, religion etc. We adopted cellphones almost globally (some parts of the world skipped landline adoption entirely). </p>
<p>From there, we have access to digital commerce globally, communication globally. And now... We're organized globally in free trade and commerce. Supply chains are global. </p>
<p>As we globalize even farther, the elites want to keep the organization going. By organizing the workforce...globally. a vaccine passport, which will absolutely evolve into a digital ID (see world economic forum 2016). From there they can organize their labor forces into compartments. Sick, feeble, old, retired, compromised, lackluster etc etc. </p>
<p>Why? Control. Just like we organize the cutlery drawer or an office desk, these psychopaths want to do the same using technology. </p>
<p>Using an international workforce so the world elites can continue their lives as we slave away. </p>
<p>Fuck all this, if Obama is the latest celebrity politician to get caught "rules for thee but not for me" shows you how pathetic this narrative is. </p>
<p>Be prepared that this could be our cementing of our rights for our generation. WW1, WW2, this is our time to fight against the global elites.</p>

        <p>I just found this article yesterday and haven’t done much more research into it, but it does seem to make sense to me, even though I hope it isn’t true.</p>

<p>It’s about the global depopulation that another commenter mentioned. He said only the “loonies” believe in this stuff. But in 2019, if we heard there was going to be a global pandemic and the whole world would lockdown, would any of us have believed it? Absolutely not. This last 1.5 years has shown me to question everything and not throw out crazy “conspiracies” just because some people laugh and say it’s ridiculous.</p>

        <p>The idea of a pandemic is not some conspiracy.. in fact it was bound to happen which is why we have plans for this. We’ve known that antibiotic resistance would soon be a problem and that another global pandemic was just a matter of when. It’s happened in the past and it will also happen again in the future. We simply can’t control  deadly viruses or bacteria from emerging, we can only hope to be able to stop the spread</p>

        <p>It’s just a lot of what I’ve seen on social media, I didn’t mean to strawman. I’ve just seen a lot of people refusing the vaccine because they believe it’s purposely harmful. My bad!</p>

        <p>People often mistake the role of Government and the  Deep State. The Government is nothing but useful idiots and functionaries. Some agents of the deep state reside at this level, and their degree of mindful participation varies. </p>
<p>The Deep State are the shadowy figures that control government, big tech, corporations, big pharma ect. They use the inertia of culture to guide policies and achieve their goals. They work on the basis of compromising organizations and regulatory bodies so that their intentions are never revealed, always providing a basis of plausible deniability for their guilt. </p>
<p>They have a easy to find history of promoting eugenics, that appears to be a shared characteristic of these "elite" lineages. </p>
<p>They believe the earth is over populated,  they believe in purity of bloodlines, they believe in the depopulation of undesirables.</p>
