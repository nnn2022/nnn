        <p>I currently have it and have underlying conditions (asthma). In every sub I’ve commented in about my mild case, I was downvoted to oblivion because I didn’t fit their narrative that everyone who gets it ends up on a ventilator and dies. All I had was no smell and really intense nausea, not even a full blown cough. It’s really not that bad as people are making it out to be. Take lots of vitamin D and zinc and you’re good to go!</p>

        <p>I’m the OP in the link. My wife has severe asthma and less symptoms than I do. If you search the news, they have been finding asthma drugs are increasingly effective in treating COVID-19, with one doctor in TX calling inhaled steroids a “silver bullet.” Asthmatics are under-represented in COVID-19 deaths by up to 50%. Please don’t be afraid!</p>

        <p>i had cold like symptoms in march and i didnt think anything of them since ive had my fair share of colds. and  since it was march, i shrugged them off as allergies. but because covid symptoms are often  so mild and mistakable for other ailments, could i have had covid? surely theres other people in the same boat as me...would it be a good idea to get the antibody test?</p>

        <p>I'd say yes because then you could contribute to the "it's not a big deal" stories... But if it were me personally? I'm getting increasingly paranoid about being out into a database or tracked (you know, more than my phone already tracks my every move). So personally, I won't get tested probably ever. But that's probably silly.</p>

        <p>I don't think you have to worry about testing databases, because those are HIPPA protected. It's the same data your doctor has and there are extreme laws that prevent it from being used outside of anonymous settings. </p>
<p>As for contact tracing, you have to volunteer for that. They can't use the testing data for it.</p>

        <p>For now.</p>
<p>And this weekend I heard a terrifying story about contact tracing from someone who went thorough it. In Vermont. A couple went to a restaurant (not a person on the internet, friends of my parents that they spoke to in real life) and they obeyed the restaurants mask requirements, they were respectful. At some point during the meal, their waiter came over and asked them for their home address, phone number, and other personal information I forget what exactly. They politely refused to give out personal information. The waiter got the manager over who told them the restaurant was required by law to collect this information to which the couple responded "that's fine we understand, we'll leave then". And they left. Once they got to their car, they saw their waiter standing outside the restaurant watching them waiting for them to drive by so they could grab their license plate number. The couple drove the other way out of the parking lot until a waiter literally stepped in front of their car, blocked them from leaving and wrote down their plate number.</p>
<p>The point is, this is only the beginning. Normal citizens are being turned into an arm of "law" enforcement. This is precisely what happened in Germany, in Brave New World, in 1984. This terrifies me.</p>
<p>So anyways... What level of paranoia is warranted, I'm not sure, but I'm pretty up there into like "I won't stop anywhere in Vermont", and mostly I just don't want to enter any store anywhere. As for how this relates to a test? I don't know, but it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility in my mind for the government (probably not the legislature since they seem not to make laws anymore in any state) to declare covid testing information public "for the common good", and then have different rules for those who tested positive or negative. Like only that group is required to wear masks. Or a bracelet. Something which would identify these people by sight. And I think you can imagine where I'm going with that. How the general public might treat those "infected" differently. I know that sounds extreme but it's REALLY not very far fetched seeing what we've seen so far.</p>

        <p>&rt;would it be a good idea to get the antibody test?</p>
<p>Not right now. Many counties and states are combining positive antibody tests and positive tests. They are using the higher numbers as an excuse to stay in lockdown longer. </p>
<p>Many counties and states are saying you need to quarantine for 14 days if you get a positive antibody test. There is also no current benefit to getting a positive antibody test. The Powers That Shouldn't Be haven't decided on the official narrative about whether immunity lasts, and if it fits their agenda, they'll just say many of the tests were unreliable (which is true).</p>

        <p>I thought this way too. I figured once I got it I could persuade people that it’s not that bad and it’s ok to go outside again. Nope. People will just discredit you and say you probably killed a grandma along the way. They only want to hear people who had severe cases, not mild ones like 99% of people have.</p>

        <p>The problem is most of those people aren't on online forums telling the story of how they had a cold. They are living their lives.  I know 12 people that have had it - ages 16-51, ranging from asymptomatic (the 16 year old) to a "bad flu" to everything in between. 3 people who had symptoms in JANUARY and have since tested positive for antibodies.  All are fine, no lingering effects at all.</p>
