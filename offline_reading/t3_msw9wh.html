    <strong>Indian actor Vivekh (Padma Shri Dr. Vivek) shilled for the Covid vax after his first shot. Within 24 hours, he had a heart attack, and within 48 hours, he was dead.</strong>
    <p><p>Tamil, India actor Vivekh (also known as "Vivek" and "Padma Shri Dr. Vivek") received his first dose and urged everyone to take it as well, acting as a vocal proponent of the experimental gene therapy "vaccines". </p>
<p>Link: <a href="https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/actor-vivekh-gets-covid-19-vaccine-urges-others-do-so-147156">https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/actor-vivekh-gets-covid-19-vaccine-urges-others-do-so-147156</a></p>
<p>The actor got his first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday at the Government Omandurar hospital. </p>
<p>From the initial article:</p>
<p>&rt;Actor-Comedian Vivekh took COVID-19 vaccine in the Government Omandurar hospital in Chennai on Thursday. After taking the vaccine, the actor urged people who are eligible, to avail themselves of the COVID-19 vaccines.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Speaking to the media, Vivekh said that he chose to get vaccinated to help dispel rumours around the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine and to inform people that vaccination is to keep us safe. “The public safety measures to keep ourselves safe (from coronavirus) is wearing masks, washing hands and maintaining adequate physical distancing. The medical way to protect ourselves is this vaccine. You might be taking Siddha medicines, Ayurvedic medicines, Vitamin-C, Zinc tablets etc. This is all fine. But these are added measures. The vaccine is the only thing that can save your life. If you ask me if people who are vaccinated don’t get COVID-19, it is not like that. Even if COVID-19 hits you, there won’t be death,” he said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Taking help of a common analogy, Vivekh said, “This is like saying you have insurance for a bike and hence you won’t meet with an accident. Even if you have insurance, you can ensure safety only if you drive responsibly. Like that, even if we get vaccinated, we should stay inside our public safety measures.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Given that the daily cases in Tamil Nadu touched an all-time high of 7,819 cases on Wednesday, State Health Secretary J <strong>Radhakrishnan said that the government is using social influencers like actor Vivekh to spread awareness about the importance of vaccination.</strong> He also said that the bed occupancy in Tamil Nadu is at 10% at present and the occupancy rate in Chennai is 20%.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“We should not panic. We should understand that our mortality rate has reduced to 1.35% and hence we should make use of the vaccination offered. This is a natural disaster and only masks will help us break the chain. Hence it should be followed scrupulously...People in cities like Chennai and Coimbatore have expressed difficulties in finding beds. We have set up a control room at the DME office to guide the people who come to the screening centres to hospitals (where vacancy is there),” he said. He added that the government is in the process of adding more beds for COVID-19 in private hospitals too. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Tamil Nadu also reported 25 deaths due to COVID-19 on Wednesday. Of the 7,819 new cases reported, 2,564 cases are from Chennai and 772 cases are from Chengalapattu. Coimbatore reported 540 new cases on Wednesday. The number of samples tested on Wednesday stood at 97,668.    </p>
<p>The following day, within 24 hours of getting the hab, Vivekh suffered an unexpected heart attack, and was taken to a local hospital, and was placed in the ICU.</p>
<p>An article announcing this featured the bullshit title: "Actor Vivekh's heart attack severe, not related to COVID-19 vaccination", saying the vaccination was unrelated, even though an autopsy hasn't been completed, and they have no fucking way of knowing this.</p>
<p>Twitter announcement with more info: <a href="https://twitter.com/Sinduj11/status/1383032256059510787">https://twitter.com/Sinduj11/status/1383032256059510787</a></p>
<p>In the Twitter announcement above, the literal Medical Director of the hospital he was admitted to says point-blank:</p>
<p>&rt;It may not be due to COVID vaccination.</p>
<p>No one has ruled anything out, so the MSM reporting it as "unrelated" is absolute horseshit.</p>

<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&rt;Actor Vivekh, who suffered a heart attack on Friday, had a 100% block in his left artery and it may not be related to Covid vaccination, said Dr Raju Sivasamy, vice-president of SIMS hospitals.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Addressing reporters here, Dr Sivasamy said what the 59-year-old actor suffered was a separate cardiac event called “ventricular fibrillation”, resulting in decreased supply of blood to the brain.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“<strong>This is actor Vivekh’s first attack.</strong> It is a severe one. We have done an angiogram, followed by angioplasty, and have placed a stent. He is presently critical, in the ECMO (Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and it may take at least 24 hours for him to improve,” said Dr Sivasamy.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;He said that Vivekh’s family members brought him to the hospital on Friday morning in an unconscious state at 11 am. “He was immediately attended to by the emergency and cardiology doctors. This is a pure cardiac issue, and we have done gene-testing and CT scan, which showed no involvement of Covid,” added Sivasamy.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The hospital bulletin, signed by its Medical Services Director Dr Vijaykumar, said that Vivekh suffered an acute coronary syndrome with cardiogenic shock, terming it a separate event that may not be due to Covid vaccination.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Meanwhile, Health Secretary Dr J. Radhakrishnan, after discussing with the doctors part of treatment, said that the doctors have done multiple tests and no link to Covid was established.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;“On Thursday, 830 people got Covaxin in Omandurar Government Hospital, including Vivekh. Today also many have taken and totally 5.6 lakh people have taken Covaxin. We have not observed such adverse effects and it is not related to the vaccine,” reiterated Radhakrishnan.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;He said that a hundred percent block does not form one day after vaccination. “On behalf of the health department, we want him to recover first. He himself came forward to take up the vaccine with a good intuition to spread awareness, and for his safety. We want him to get well soon,” Radhakrishnan said.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Actor Vivekh, after taking his vaccine on Thursday, <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2021/apr/16/social-influencers-urged-to-allay-fears-on-covid-vaccination-2290540.html"><strong>had said that both Covaxin and Covishield were safe and people must come forward to take them</strong></a>.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Radhakrishnan too urged people to cast away their fears and come forward to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>And then, less than 24 hours after being hospitalized, the actor died.</p>

<p>From the description:</p>
<p>&rt; Actor Vivekh, who suffered a heart attack on Friday, passed away on Saturday at 4.35 am, a hospital spokesperson said.  He was 59. Celebrities and ministers have taken to Twitter to share their condolences at the passing of the Padma Shree awardee.  </p>
<p>Source for more info on his death: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/actor-vivekh-passes-away-after-being-hospitalised/articleshow/82111126.cms?from=mdr">https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/actor-vivekh-passes-away-after-being-hospitalised/articleshow/82111126.cms?from=mdr</a></p>
<p>From the article reporting his passing:</p>
<p>&rt;Actor Vivekh has passed away at 4.45am this morning. The actor had been hospitalised on Friday after suffering cardiac arrest.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Vivekh, who was busy shooting for the yet-to-be-titled project along with Legend Saravanan, felt uneasy while he was at his home on Friday, after which he was rushed to the hospital. The actor was unconscious when he was taken to the hospital, in Chennai, and was placed under observation in the cath lab with ECMO support. He had undergone angioplasty because of a block in the heart.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Doctors in the hospital have clarified that the cardiac arrest was due to a 100% block in the blood vessel, after rumours started spreading that the actor had developed this complication after getting vaccinated against COVID-19 on Thursday.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The hospital authorities released a statement on Friday evening in which they said that the actor was in a critical condition. The statement read, “Vivekh was brought to the hospital in an unconscious state by 11am today to the emergency by the family members. He was resuscitated in the emergency room by specialists. Later he underwent Emergency Coronary Angiogram followed by Angioplasty. He is currently in critical condition on ECMO in the Intensive Care Unit.”<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Vivekh, who made his acting debut in K Balachander's Manathil Urudhi Vendum, in 1987, went on to become one of the most sought-after comedians in Tamil cinema. Taking inspiration from the legendary NS Krishnan, he developed a fan base with his brand of comedy through which he delivered social messages in a humorous way, and He came to be addressed as Chinna Kalaivanar.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;He was very prolific for over a decade (from the mid-90s to the mid-2000s), acting with every major top star in Kollywood, from Rajinikanth to Vijay, Ajith, Suriya, Vikram, Dhanush and Silambarasan TR. He also had his dream of acting alongside Kamal Haasan come true recently when he was signed on for the actor's Indian 2.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The actor also played the lead in films like Naan Than Bala and Vellai Pookal, and won critical acclaim for his performances in these films. His last release was Dharala Prabhu, starring Harish Kalyan, in 2020.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;He received the prestigious Padma Shri in 2009 from the Government of India for his contribution to the arts. He had also received the Kalaivanar Award from Government of Tamil Nadu. He had won the Tamil Nadu State film Awards five times, and the Filmfare Award thrice.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;An admirer of APJ Abdul Kalam, Vivekh had taken the mission of planting a billion trees on the advice of the late president. He had planted over 30 lakh trees under his Green Kalam project.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;He is survived by his wife Arulselvi, and two children.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The actor's passing away has sent shock waves throughout Kollywood and various film personalities have been expressing their shock on social media. </p>
<p>Despite Radhakrishnan saying that "a hundred percent block does not form one day after vaccination," the issue was described elsewhere not as a typical blockage, but as a result of a "blood clot": <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/2021/apr/17/actor-vivekhpasses-away-in-chennai-after-suffering-heart-attack-2291125.html">https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/2021/apr/17/actor-vivekhpasses-away-in-chennai-after-suffering-heart-attack-2291125.html</a></p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&rt;Actor Vivekh passes away in Chennai after suffering heart attack: <strong>The veteran actor had a hundred-percent blood clot in his left artery</strong>, hospital officials said, adding that it may not be related to Covid vaccination.</p>
<p>It went on:</p>
<p>&rt;The veteran actor was admitted to the hospital on Friday following a cardiac arrest. <br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;The hospital officials said that the actor had a hundred percent block in his left artery and added that it 'may not be related <strong>to the Covid vaccination</strong>' he had taken on Thursday.<br>
&rt;<br>
&rt;Addressing reporters, Dr. Raju Sivasamy, vice-president of SIMS hospitals, had said earlier what the 59-year-old actor suffered was a separate cardiac event called “ventricular fibrillation”, resulting in decreased supply of blood to the brain.</p></p>

        <p>Well- he sort of accomplished something related- though it had nothing to do with <em>dispelling</em> rumors- more like dignifying them.  He ended up giving his life for the truth... an accidental hero.</p>

        <p>My cousin spent almost three months in the hospital with Covid having trouble breathing and nearly died. A separate cousin of mine caught Covid and wouldn’t have noticed if he wasn’t being regularly tested. Both are young, active and otherwise healthy.</p>
<p>Just based off personal experience, I’ve found it affects everyone differently and have since looked to avoid blanket statements. But that’s just my two cents.</p>
