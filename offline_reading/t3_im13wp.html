        <p>I was willing to give Northam a pass on that one because of the passage of time. What made me lose respect for him was his showing up in Virginia Beach with no mask and not distancing while (A) telling us to do the same and (B) instituting a mask mandate the following week. Fucking hypocrite.</p>

        <p>i gave him a half-pass for the yearbook, because we all make mistakes when we're young, and youthful indiscretions should be forgiven so long as you learn as lesson.</p>
<p>his bitch ass didn't learn a lesson! he really is just a racist good ole boy.</p>
<p>i thought with a "doctor" in charge, Virginia would be sensible. harness the research prowess of our fine in-state universities! partner up with our high tech Dulles corridor! get shit done in tandem with our helpful friendly National Guard, get the Navy in on some action! Amazon!</p>
<p>no. just no. Northam and the Democratic General Assembly have botched this irreparably from day zero.</p>
<p>i got angry when Northam wouldn't answer simple questions about our nursing homes. i don't trust him. we still don't know if covid-19 positive patients were sent to long term care group facilities. why didn't we make sure they had PPE? why didn't we ramp up testing for staff and residents? that's why we have a National Guard, FFS. if i ever find out that we built an entire field hospital at the Dulles Expo Center that never saw one covid-19 patient and yet he sent infected persons into the most vulnerable population, i will lose my fucking mind.</p>
<p>he failed to protect the elderly people living in nursing homes. 53% of Virginia's deaths come from long term care facilities. fuck him. i hope he spends his time in hell in a shitty nursing home.</p>
<p>my own grandfather is alone in a nursing home in upstate New York, i don't know when i will ever see him again. he suffers from dementia. it's heartbreaking. my paternal grandmother passed away nine years ago in a home in Virginia; she had good care, she was loved by the staff, we saw her every day. but we have all seen the bad nursing homes. it's a fucking hate crime. Northam isn't telling the truth about nursing homes in Virginia and i would bet that he is just as bad, if not worse, than Cuomo, Murphy, Wolf, etc.</p>
<p>and don't even get me started on how Northam has done nothing to really help the low income, minority communities in Virginia that are being slammed by this right now - not necessarily by death, but with infections in essential workers, workers who can't stay home. how are we helping immigrants? people with very little English? yes, Black lives matter - how the fuck are we helping poor African American communities and families in Virginia? are we doing any outreach at all to the Hispanic community? what about the kids, the kids who aren't in school, who might not be getting healthy meals, who don't have internet, who don't have an adult to help them, who fall behind every single day they aren't in school?</p>
<p>Northam is a goddamn hypocrite. fuck him. fuck his mask (the klan hood and the face diaper). fuck his "social distancing." fuck him for locking down our beaches and our state parks. fuck him for crashing our economy and the trying to cuckold the police. fuck him for messing with the GOP primary.</p>
<p>fuck him for taking away the right to a death with dignity for the elderly in nursing homes, and fuck him for taking away the bright future of a generation of school children. </p>
<p>i don't care that he's a racist - that, i expected. i didn't expect him to be a full-on psychopath.</p>
