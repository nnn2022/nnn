    <strong>Looking for like minded, trustful bug-out/preppers. Vancouver...</strong>
    <p><p>I feel something bad is coming this flu season. I'm absolutely frustrated. I need to escape here. But I was stupid, and I didn't get a driver's license when I was younger. Now I will have to hitch or somehow bike out of here.* </p>
<p>I'm <em>sincerely</em> asking and looking for people who want to escape the Vancouver region(I'm in Surrey). I think it should be either direct to *our* own community or go to a rural town for a bit, and then go from there.</p>
<p>I am trustworthy, not that saying means s*it. I will prove it. I've got a bit saved up, but I'm pretty sure others have more. I am not looking for romantic relationships, friend or whatever because that's been a sore spot for me and since 2020 it became worse, and those are for the <em>good times</em>. Just need people that I can trust and depend on as well to make the transition easier. Is that freaking too much to ask!?</p>
<p>*I figure I will rig a battery pack on an e-bike with enough capacity to allow 200km+ range, which I will modify to have it work as a short-term power source once I am there. I have enough electronics knowledge to do so.</p>
<p>Work on solar? Or just labor? I will do it for the community. But are there really people interested, or interested in accepting me, or setting up one with me? Am I just wasting my time and energy?</p></p>

        <p>Yes. I hadn't thought that some people aren't aware of where Vancouver is. </p>
<p>You know what I will travel as far as Alberta to do so, or even Saskatchewan as necessary.</p>
