    <strong>Knowing what you know, what is your #1 priority or goal for the future?</strong>
    <p><p>Mine is to delay my father's vaccination.</p>
<p>I remain skeptical about the benefits of the injection outweighing the risks. The media is starting to push hard and hype up the shot in my area and I have no doubt that if not for my intervention, my old man would line up for it bright and early...</p>
<p>So far, I've put effort into educating him about ways that he can bolster and protect his own immune system in a more natural way. I bought him some ACES (essential micronutrients) and some NAC (glutathione precursor) and I suggested that he take it consistently for a couple of months to help his body build up some reserves. He has been open to it so far because he has accepted the fact that there is a "rare" chance of adverse events associated with these vaccines, and he wants to make sure that his body is prepared. </p>
<p>Hopefully this will buy me a couple of months. Then I plan to point out to him that summer isn't usually flu season, so that it might be prudent to wait until the fall to get the shot (most people will probably be getting their second injections at this point). With any luck he'll see the reason to this.</p>
<p>After that, I'm pretty out of ideas. But I'll keep trying to figure new ways to nudge him in the direction of "taking an experimental injection wont make me healthier."</p>
<p>Whats your main goal, knowing what you know?</p></p>

        <p>Wait as long as possible to move out of NY. I want to make sure my next state isn't going to flip. After I move, I'm looking into homesteading.</p>

        <p>Good call to not make any rushed decisions based on the current events. I'd probably also try my best to wait out the storm before considering complete relocation.</p>

        <p>My entire family is against Covid and everything it stands for. My goal is to educate others (especially other kids my age) that they need to wake the fuck up and actually educate themselves about the reality of the situation instead of blindly following the government.</p>

        <p>Great idea. Teaching people to be able to think critically will be key if we're going to stand any chance at changing things.</p>
