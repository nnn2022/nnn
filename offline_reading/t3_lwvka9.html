        <p>People act like fraud is some new concept. But what is new in this case the openness of it all. Top down orders to mark clear non-covid deaths as covid. </p>
<p>You can ask the why would they and what’s to gain? Many things, hospitals are corporations. They’re really not in the business to save lives. Extra money for anything covid, sure why not. </p>
<p>Doctors/nurses are hero’s now. So two options, blow the whistle which many have. Didn’t work out to well for them but I have the utmost respect for them having integrity. Second enjoy all the attention. Actually I’m wrong, a third option is ask questions about what’s happening then get transferred the moment you walk the door.</p>
<p>CDC/WHO why would they lie? Simple it’s a revolving door of NGO’s, doctors and big pharma reps. It’s a scam simple and plain. They go into governmental positions, set the con to trap the dupes. Get a that a boy here’s a seven figure salary a year at J&amp;J. Gonna need you to create some bogus studies get that going. The circle goes around and around. These people fail upwards. Do a shit job and kill thousands you get a raise!</p>

        <p>Baby boomer generation is at it's lives end.  As name indicates, they were result of huge population spike after the ww2 ended. So expect now things going in the opposite trend. USA also has huge ever-growing fat population who are just as vulnerable to diseases. Should mandate losing weight  instead of banning movement outside, closing gyms &amp; obstructing breathing for people who already gasp for air as it is... Oh well...</p>
