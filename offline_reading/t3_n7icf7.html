    <strong>So I've been looking in to the mRNA vaccine and I'm wondering about something that's stated on the CDCs website.</strong>
    <p><p>So on the CDCs website it states "mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell which is where our DNA is kept".</p>
<p>Now this is where things get fucky for me. How is it that the "instructions" for your cells to create the spike protein are read by your cells and learned then follow said instructions without altering your DNA? I've always been taught in middle school through college that your DNA tells your cells what to do.</p>
<p>Cancer for example is the result of "corrupted" or mutated DNA within the cells, which is why it's so difficult to stop cancer, these cells reproduce with their mutated DNA and replicate faster than others, eventually taking over and killing the host from non functional cells taking over essential cells.</p>
<p>I mean am I just way off here? Can some contribute to my thoughts here.</p></p>

        <p>DNA is transcribed to make a strand of mRNA, which leaves the nucleus.  It goes to the ribosomes in the cytoplasm for protein synthesis.</p>
<p>The vaccines introduce foreign mRNA into the cytoplasm which works just like your native mRNA to make proteins.</p>
<p>The mRNA never integrates into your DNA.  Now, a DNA drug could change your DNA.  The mRNA agents only change your protein expression.  Which, in this case, is bad enough.</p>

        <p>mRNA is made from DNA to create the protines the body needs. It's made and then trown out into the cell to be used. </p>
<p>I thi k it's made to sound sciencey and to be readable to the avarge man. </p>
<p>DNA does not tell your body what to do. It just lays there. Then it's chopped into small pieces if needed, mRNA. The mRNA is a negative copy of DNA. Outside the nucleus, the cell takes the mRNA and uses it to form tRNA.</p>
<p>I have no idea what happens with the used mRNA. If the cell dipose of it or keep it, eventually clogging itself up. </p>
<p>DNA have a thing in the end of it giving the DNA mortality. If this is missing, you have immortal DNA. Immortal life achieved. For some reason those cells reproduce faster than the middle East. That's what cancer is. 
If your DNA was round, like a circle, we would be nearly immortal too. </p>
<p>That was what I remember from highschool.</p>
