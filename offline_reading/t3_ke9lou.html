<p>In the end this is always the 'root cause' but to effectively loose weight its more than just saying eat less move more. </p>
<p>You need to consider why people are consuming too much. A big part of this is people eat tons of processed carbs and little dietary fat. </p>
<p>Consuming lots of carbs causes a large insulin response, which then makes you hungrier sooner, so you eat more, which leads to an insulin response, repeat until diabetic. </p>
<p>Fixing nutrition and educating people about how to eat so they are both satiated and not riding the insulin roller coaster promoted by our modern diet is much more important than just repeating eat less move more.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, <em>it doesn't matter</em> why people are consuming too much. That's a different problem, for psychology and sociology to solve.</p>
<p>If you eat too many calories because you are hungry, or you like carbs, or you're depressed, or you eat your feelings, or you live in a food desert, or you're an addict, it doesn't matter, the result will ALWAYS be the same. Excess calories leads to weight gain.</p>
<p>If all you have access to is processed carbs, bummer; but you can still control your weight be eating less of them. To suggest otherwise is excuse-making, which clearly has failed the vast majority of people. </p>
<p>Vitamins, minerals, macronutrient breakdown, etc. may definitely play a role in WHY people overeat, but they play no role in the cause of obesity - which is excess consumption of calories, regardless of the source of those calories. </p>
<p>It would definitely be better if people exercised more, but it pales in comparison to calorie consumption. If you eat too many calories it's difficult/impossible to burn enough by exercising in a reasonable time. Exercise is like the last 5% while the calories in is responsible for 95% of the outcome. </p>
<p>Ultimately, people just need to eat less, regardless of what they are eating. If they can only do and understand one thing, that's it - consume fewer calories.</p>

        <p>It does matter why. If you don't understand why you are always hungry, there is only so long you can limit calories through force of will when the only thing you need to do to get them is stop trying to not. </p>
<p>Imagine someone who is an alcoholic, but instead of quitting drinking entirely, or figuring out why they drink, they instead just try really hard to only drink one beer a day. Eventually they will fail. With food, you unfortunately don't have the option to go cold turkey. </p>
<p>Right now we have dietary guidelines that suggest not eating foods that satiate you (fat and to a lesser extent protein) in favor of replacing them with 'heart healthy' grains, which is only setting people up for failure and weight gain, which is <em>exactly</em> what happened since those guidelines were introduced.</p>

        <p>Remember not even two decades ago the movie Super Size Me came out and all of a sudden people cared about their weight and being obese was considered wrong and bad for you and your health and fast food chains said they were committed to ending obesity? Now it is celebrated. Obese models are now on billboards shilling clothing brands and commercials and ads are saying you are healthy at any size. It's disgusting what our society has become. I'm not saying everyone needs to look like a super model, but the media lies to us and just wants us all to be mindless consumers with no common sense anymore.</p>

        <p>Correct. Since we now live in a post-risk-acceptance society, playing sports is selfish. You might injure yourself and have to go to the hospital. That means doctors and nurses would have to divert care away from Covid patients in order to address your self-inflicted, selfish injuries. </p>
<p>There is no reason for you to be playing sports in the middle of a literal pandemic anyway! You don’t physically need sports to survive, so the government should cut them out of our lives permanently, like all other Nonessential activities. Also, having any sort of fun is somehow disrespectful to the 200,000 people who died of Covid.</p>

        <p>Exactly, and it is! </p>
<p>I've had to purchase independent catastrophic health insurance when living abroad, and I always paid extra for the "competitive sports rider" and the "hazardous sports rider" because of my athletic activities. The insurance companies know it is added risk, so they charged me extra because I was more likely to get injured than their regular, more stagnant client.</p>

        <p>I promise you that a humane healthcare system will never happen in this country, so you can stop worrying about it. The corporations and the rich who own them also own this country.

        <p>now now, this actually does not properly compare, because first off there is actual research showing harm of process meats, meats in general and soda.</p>
<p>and 2: meats mean, that an innocent animal got imprisoned tortured and murdered just like they are doing with us now.</p>
<p>the "vulnerable to disease" nonsense and thus not allowed to eat or drink certain things  though  is a good comparison to show the complete and utter insanity going on.</p>
<p>also the insanity, that the traitor governments dare talk about health, when it is them, who are fighting a war against public health by pushing poisons like sodium fluoride, mercury, aluminium, GMOs, etc... etc... onto the people against their will.</p>
<p>and at the same time they are demonizing and fighting a war against healing substances like cannabis, vitamin b17, etc....</p>
<p>people are so deep into their mind control, that they somehow still didn't get what nonsense it is to follow the mass murdering government.</p>

        <p>Forcing someone to wear a mask can't be compared to forcing someone to eat healthy, just because not eating can't get you to transmit diseases to other. The diseases you catch by eating non healthy food are only impacting you and aren't contagious</p>

        <p>Here's the conservative brain in action. Because regulating someone's diet to make sure that they individually don't suffer as much consequences virus is exactly the same as wearing a piece of cloth while in public to keep you from spreading the virus to everyone around you. The hog myth that the only factor that determines how well you handle COVID is your diet is fucking moronic to say the least. Would you also like to pay for all of the asthmatics inhalers, pay for obese people's liposuction, and insulin medication personally yourself, seeing as how much you care about individual health? All of those things are risk factors after all. Or are you just trying to make it seem like anyone who has been infected and suffered has been 100% their own fault and they deserve to die? I'm sure it's the later. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Stop being a selfish pussy, put on the mask and care about someone other than yourself for once.</p>

        <p>Not a conservative, leftist. I just don't show solidarity with people who show me none. I don't even want to hear about rights to humane healthcare from a fucking country who gives me the choice of Joe Biden or Donald Trump. There is no choice for a humane healthcare system, so I don't give a flying fuck what those people think they can fuck off. </p>
<p>The vast majority of the covid deaths are people with comobidities, obesity is one of those. Yes, wearing a piece of cloth over my face is a severe restriction, and if you want me to do it for your health, your health is my business then. Fewer people with comorbidities, fewer to die, less likely I'll be forced to wear masks. </p>
<p>I hope you ate healthy today, you fat ass bully.</p>
