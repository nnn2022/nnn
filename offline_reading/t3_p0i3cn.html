        <p>It’s important to say <em>what</em> the hoax is. There’s something definitely going around, but there’s so much more to the situation. The “pandemic” escalated because of not just our government’s refusal to respond correctly, but governments all over the world.</p>
<p>Look at what China did first; they released literal propaganda commercials of people frothing at the mouth and falling over dead due to “COVID”. We know this isn’t what happens, so we can deduce the reason for this was fear-mongering. </p>
<p>Remember how everyone freaked the fuck out and ran to the grocery stores, <em>forcing</em> a scarcity of much needed supplies? Even the supplier themselves said something to the effect of “there is not a shortage, people are just buying unnecessarily large amounts of product that completely overshoot what is normally delivered”.</p>
<p>The CDC has also lied several times, and don’t even get me started on Fauci the Fraudster. We’re dealing with misinformation on such a vast level that the several layers allow for what I call the “infinite lie”. It has no end, because of the nature of the lie. It can be built off of very easily, because the lies have been peddled by people abusing their status as a nurse, a doctor, or even a journalist. Worse yet, people who have no clue what they’re talking about latch onto this garbage. They further spread it like it’s the gospel truth, and don’t even bother to question it.</p>
<p>Now they want us to get a jab that may or may not end up killing us. The real issue here is this is not an isolated issue, this is part of a <em>much</em> larger problem that is now finally starting to show itself. </p>
<p>We have a senile old man in the White House that <em>more than likely</em> did not even win legitimately, who is now probably going to be replaced by a madwoman. This entire situation is the perfect chaos to pretty much disable the public from being able to adequately respond to the crimes committed not just by this joke of an “Administration” but also our own Congress.</p>
<p>This isn’t about Right or Left, this is about the survival of the country.</p>

        <p>Well, judging by that video that was posted on the sub earlier of that scientist talking about the spike protein, you may be right after a fashion. I’d say this is definitely looking more and more like a bioweapon.</p>

        <p>In the beginning of it all I realized it was bs, no evidence of it being very dangerous. Even in March of 2020 I had people on reddit tell me how dumb I was to not see how bad this virus was, and I did get people saying that I will regret not taking it seriously when ”one of your relatives dies”. Fastforward to today and not one single person in my entire family tree (and thats a big one) died and not one had to go to the hospital for it, but a lot of us had it including myself. Not even anyone at work or any friends died or any friends relatives. And the data is on my side, the likelyhood of dying is so miniscule its laughable</p>

        <p>I would say there's a new virus out there, but they're doing everything to make a bigger deal out of it than it needs to be. They amplify the numbers, the suppress cheap, effective treatments, and cherry pick whatever stories they can to push fear.</p>

        <p>Me. There was definitely something odd about saying deadly! deadly virus! And trying to incite fear and panic while people on the internet laughed about it. The government shouldn't be creating panic- wouldn't be- unless it was a nothingburger threat. Idk what is up but it was NEVER about a virus and I knew from the first moment I heard about it on the news- the first restrictions.</p>

        <p>I find myself in a funny middle ground. I don't know *what* the fuck this COVID situation is. I see the possibilities as ranging from "power move by the elite" to "genuine virus and emergency which has been handled with great incompetence by the government and media".</p>
<p>I've seen compelling arguments on both sides. I've seen evidence which points in both directions. And then you have to put human nature into the mix.</p>
<p>I don't think it's even possible to be certain anymore. The back and forth argument has become so loud, the various sources saying various things has become so ridiculous. You can't even know who's trustworthy and who's just a talking head anymore - on both sides of the fence.</p>
<p>And everyone's so emotional about it, so invested in what they already believe, that it's not even possible to have calm discussions about it.</p>
