    <strong>Mandatory vaccines for healthcare workers</strong>
    <p><p>I recently came back to the healthcare field after stepping away from it for about  two years. I am prior active duty so I’m no stranger to being a guinea pig when it comes to medical care. During boot camp, recruits are literally lined up and injected with like 4-7 different vaccines (I went through in 2014). They don’t care about vaccine schedules.  Everyone gets every shot no matter when you had it last.  </p>
<p>My parents raised me without medications and excessive doctors visits. I didn’t take my first antibiotic until my early 20s. It was a preventative one for having had my wisdom teeth pulled. I still have never taken an antibiotic for a specific illness. I rarely get sick and consider myself to be super healthy. </p>
<p>The issue: I am worried the vaccine will be made mandatory and I’ll have to get it for work. I am a federal employee (working on a military base but contracted through a company) and I live in California.  I am also almost 19 weeks pregnant. It is blowing my mind that the majority of pregnant women on Reddit will tell you to avoid sushi and blue cheese but shame you for not getting this experimental gene therapy. It has not even been out long enough to study the effects on the child.  </p>
<p>I don’t know what I can do. Sure I can perhaps get an exemption due to the pregnancy but I plan to breastfeed and worry about my baby drinking poisonous fluid. Also, I don’t want that shit in me period. Baby or not.  If I refuse and I am fired…I probably won’t get unemployment.  Unemployment wouldn’t even touch what I am making now.  I am scared. </p>
<p>I’m a Christian but somehow I feel like religious exemptions are going to be out the window since, at the root, this is political not medical </p>
<p>The government doesn’t give out anything for free and big pharma wants you to stay ill. There is money in panic and meds but not peace and health. </p>
<p>Im not some woo woo person who thinks cancer can be cured with essential oils. I simply think healthy people do not need to inject things into themselves to…”stay healthy”. </p>
<p>Side note: I began worrying about this after overhearing the front desk woman and one of the social workers talk about how it needs to be mandated but we still need masks.  OK. Give me a break.  We primarily work with active duty 18-35 who have substance issues. Bare minimum exposure risk.   </p>
<p>What can I even do?</p></p>

        <p>Heard there is a lot of Mercury in the "vaccines". I saw reports of miscarriages after taking the jab and breastfeeding it been seeing babies bleed from eye and many other things that are too disturbing to talk about. Quite disturbing how they say it's safe and effective</p>

        <p>That is hard to hear, God is with you every step of the way. I am luckily in a private Uni so they may not make us vaccinate. I support all other vaccines, but holding off on this one. A lot of unknowns still nevertheless I don’t even need it. </p>
<p>I want to join the military too… I really hope they don’t make it mandatory…</p>

        <p>Its a tough situation and not worth sacrificing your baby’s health for a job that refuses to accommodate your concerns. If you are are planning on breastfeeding then I would not under any circumstance get the vaccine until you are satisfied with the science and safety of the vaccine. That might be several years or never and that is your decision. </p>
<p>God provides. He provided a country that has tons of lawsuits and lawyers and work place protection and rights and laws. Most of the time these things drive people nuts until now when these features become relevant to you and your predicament.</p>
<p>Start searching for a doctor that will start the documentation that will provide medical reasons why you cannot take the vaccine. Take advantage of that second opinion thing.</p>
<p>If you are mandated then be prepared to go on some sort of medical disability. As in you cannot be on the job because they changed the rules for you and cannot or will not accommodate your medical condition.</p>
<p>Finally, Im in California too. I get hosed on taxes every year. Its okay to take some of that back. The state has really raked you over the coals with this covid thing. Christians typically struggle with a self imposed limit on taking from the state but this time it’s different.</p>
<p>Most of all stay silent about the issue at work. Lots of places are ‘at will’ employers. As soon as they get a whiff that you are going to be difficult then your out. </p>
<p>As soon as the mandate comes then best you have all your duck in a row. Best case, they make you wear a mask and perhaps work remotely. Second best scenario is that they put you on workplace disability, or provide a severance because they cannot accommodate your medical condition. Worst, fired for insubordination.</p>
<p>From their perspective they get the mandate from the military medical system and this may be out of their hands. </p>
<p>These are my thoughts given your scenario. Surely you don’t have to navigate this yourself. Find someone in your professional network that is struggling with similar issues.</p>

        <p>This is really simple…if you don’t want the vaccine, don’t get it.</p>
<p>There will always be another job.</p>
