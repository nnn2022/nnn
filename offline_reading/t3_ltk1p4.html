    <strong>What if it was for no reason?</strong>
    <p><p>As a thought experiment lets pretend that there was no virus at all nobody ever talked about a virus and there was no evidence of one everything is totally normal.
Then one day the Government came out and said we have decided it would be best for everyone to wear masks from here on out and you now need to wear one, fines will be issued if you do not do this have a nice day.</p>
<p>Is there anyone in their right mind who would argue that this is not going to have multitudes of negative effects on society?
Yet somehow, because the regime's chorus in unison decreed a virus what would previously be a heinous attack on the population is now a virtuous endeavor that we all must labor ourselves the mental and physical burden of.</p>
<p>Lets hope this spell eventually wears off.</p></p>
