        <p>This Canadian doctor is simply discussing his observations regarding his own patients and their blood test results. Meanwhile the "fact checkers" are furiously "debunking" his observations by claiming he hasn't provided evidence of his "claims." He's specifically states he's waiting for more thorough test results that require time and further observations from his patients blood work before he takes steps beyond simply discussing it with panels of medical doctors like we see in this video. He isn't making "claims," he's discussing his initial findings from his patients reactions to the vaccine. The severe fatigue they are experiencing has debilitated their lives immensely.</p>
<p>The people "debunking" his observations are literally leftwing blog writers with English and Film degrees, and a few guys who literally work for Pfizer, who would obviously NEVER lie for the sake of profits...</p>

        <p>What's shocking is that the medical industry overall remains so uninformed (and/or ignorant) of the risks associated with these experimental gene therapies. My feeling is they are being hoodwinked at the same level the rest of the population is.</p>

        <p>Dr. Hoffe explains:</p>
<p>“The concern is now that <strong>these vessels are permanently damaged in a person’s lungs. When the heart tries to pump blood through all those damaged vessels, there’s increased resistance trying to pump the blood through those lungs. So those people are going to develop something called pulmonary artery hypertension, high blood pressure in their lungs, and the concern with that is that those people will probably all develop right-sided heart failure within three years and die.</strong>
Because they now have <strong>increased vascular resistance through their lungs</strong> and lung tissue and heart tissue and brain and spinal tissue, and all of that does not regenerate. In other tissues it can regenerate, liver and kidneys and muscle, but there’s some tissues that cannot, and so <strong>this absolutely explains what I’ve seen in my patients</strong> and that’s what I’m doing to prove it in my studies ongoing.”

        <p>Yup, and Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi has contacted Dr. Hoffe regarding the “vaccines” and microscopic clots.</p>
<p>At 12:30 mark in the video below. Dr. Bhakdi talks about the clotting issue.</p>

<h2>Dr. Hoffe’s office burned down in the Lytton wildfires:</h2>
<p><strong>“So this fire which wiped out my medical practice last week has now deleted the rest of my income. So I went 50% to zero and lost all…”</strong></p>
<p>“I have since <strong>received wonderful information</strong> particularly from a brilliant Immunologist and Medical doctor in Germany called <strong>Sucharit Bhakdi,</strong> and he explained to me how these vaccines work. And so that’s what I am going to explain to your listeners. This explains exactly the answer that I was asking to Dr. Bonnie Henry about what is the mechanism of injury for all of these vaccine injured patients that I now have.”</p>

        <p>Yeah, it’s certainly interesting timing with the fire and Hoffe’s findings.</p>
<p>“Update 30/07/2021: Bill Sardi has come up with another analysis of the phenomenon. They have better links to Bhakdi’s research which Dr. Hoffe was referencing. To quote,</p>
<p><strong>Microbiologist Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi displays what is happening in a visual online graphic. The RNA injected into your body are going to enter the cells that line blood vessels.  He points to spiny spike protein that these cells will generate and protrude outwards to attract blood platelets and form micro-clots. Days after vaccination, white blood cells known as lymphocytes as well as antibodies will begin to mount an attack against these cells.  If you dare to repeat this (get the second jab), “God help you” warns Dr. Bhakdi.</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Bhakdi points to lymphocytes (L) and antibodies (AB) that begin to mount an attack against your own blood vessels following RNA/DNA COVID-19 vaccination.”

<p>The Lytton wildfires reminded me of this old account of John D. Rockefeller’s criminal exploits. Of course, the Rockefeller crew took over medical education and along with I.G. Farben gave us the corrupt Pharma we know today.</p>
<p><strong>John D. Rockefeller’s methods:</strong></p>
<p>“His methods are illustrated by the reports of <a href="http://pagetutor.com/standard/contents.html">Ida Tarbell in The History Of The Standard Oil Co.</a> and by Anton Mohr in The Oil War. The latter reports: (p. 209) "Standard Oil's intrigues—<strong>the Americans even hired bands of Mexican brigands, who destroyed Pearson's (Mexican) oil pipes and set his wells on fire</strong>. . ."</p>
<p>“Nevins subtitled his official biography of Rockefeller, The Heroic Age Of American Enterprise. <strong>If systematic use of arson, murder, burglary, theft, extortion, swindling, blackmail, wholesale corruption of public officials and gangsterism on a grandiose scale are "heroic", this was indeed an heroic age.  And one of the most "heroic" of the contemporary figures was John D. Rockefeller.</strong> All his untiring energy and sleepless enterprise were devoted to the "holy" purpose of acquiring unlimited wealth and power, and the "security" he sought for himself.”</p>

        <p>This shit is scary as hell. I always found it weird that clothing only hapenned in certain individual. </p>
<p>Like, if the vaccine induce cloting, it's inherently the vaccine that is producing the clots and like tylenol which thins the blood, it would logically do the same to everyone.</p>
<p>Now we call it the clot-shot. Man. Very scary thing, and the worse is, because these are microscopic clots, most go unnoticed, and couple that with media silence on everything against their vaccine agenda, and nobody will know about it.</p>
