        <p>&rt;“To every university student out there, if you have done something that is not so great and so smart, you’ve been in a crowd without a mask, you’re likely to become infected,”</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>So how come most people <em>didn't</em> get infected in March and April when almost nobody was wearing masks and the virus was spreading faster than it is now? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isn't the idea to prevent the WEARER from transmitting it to other people? Make up your mind.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&rt;"The best enforcement for masks is retail. I will see people like get out of their car, run up to the gas station and then they see the sign: ‘No mask, no entry.’ That kind of constant behavioral reinforcement, that we need to have a mask on when we’re in public and anywhere. So it is not theoretical, masks work."</p>
<p>No, that doesn't prove anything about how effective they are or aren't. It means putting up a sign telling people they have to wear them will get more people to do it. You could order everyone to wear green socks under threat of fines or worse, put up a sign that says "Green Socks Required For Entry," and many more people will wear green socks, even though they don't do anything but keep your feet warm.</p>

        <p>Total confirmed deaths on Mar. 8 in the US: 22, 19 of which are from Washington, presumably mostly (or all?) associated with the nursing home outbreak</p>
<p>Can I ask again for the billionty-ith time - if this spreads so quickly and "exponentially" why is it that on Mar. 8, we were all going about our lives as normal, not wearing masks, and there was absolutely no crisis, no overwhelmed hospitals, no nothing.  There was the situation at one nursing home and possibly the hospital in Georgia (can't remember off the top of my head the timing on that one).  I think this is really significant and I hope one day it gets the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>Maybe there is some satisfying answer out there somewhere, but I have yet to hear anyone even address this issue.</p>

        <p>Because when you have a hammer, every problem is a nail. </p>
<p>All these Drs. and government administrators have made a career out of being overly cautious and always seeing the worst case scenario in everything.  To make it in government you always have to follow the rules, adhere to social norms, and always do what is perceived to be practical. Its basically a conveyor belt of conformity.  </p>
<p>So when a crisis happens, you go to the playbook.   These people have made a career out of creating policy papers designed to combat the next big pandemic.  So when a pandemic happens, you review the rules that they wrote, and then you follow these rules until the pandemic is over. </p>
<p>That is how it works.  Masks work because we have a position paper agreed to by a committee of experts that say they work.  If masks don't work, it is because people are not using them correctly --not because our experts are wrong or shortsighted.  That is fact - because our committee members voted on this being a fact. And this committee is made up of scientists, so it is also science.  Any questioning of this policy is outside the bounds of science and must be disregarded.  Just follow the science and you will be fine.</p>

<p>This speaks volumes. Dr. Brix said in the article link I provided:</p>
<p>""When people start to realize that 99% of us are going to be fine, it becomes more and more difficult" to get people to comply, she said. (Dr. Birx to the Arkansas Governor and round table.)"</p>
