    <strong>No "Nonessential" Machines Manufactured</strong>
    <p><p>I think this information is important but I don't know where to share it.  If it's not okay here, please delete.</p>
<p>Our dishwasher died last week.  I'm pretty handy so I went through all the repair advice I could find online (e.g., breaker box, wires disconnected, etc.), but it was something that would require a guy to come out and look at it.  We've called for repairs on other major appliances and know that, if we can afford it at the time, it's better (and cheaper) in the long run to just buy a new one.  </p>
<p>So we went to Lowes.  They had about 30 different models on display.  We got a guy to come help us and he tells us that this will be easy for him because he only has  4 dishwashers left in stock.  He had one each of two models, and two of another model.  Thankfully, these were not the $1000 models; two of them were the cheapest models.  He said that he has not had a new shipment of dishwashers in 6 months, and there is no way to order more.  He said some stores were totally out of them, and that if we didn't like the models available, we should go to Home Depot or other competitors to find what we need.  He wasn't being a jerk about it, we really only had two models to choose from and they weren't the ones we initially picked out.</p>
<p>He said dishwashers are deemed "unessential" and that manufacturers were building "essential items like ventilators" instead.  He clearly thought it was BS.</p>
<p>Similar thing happened in September when our printer died.  We went to WalMart to buy a new one, they had two models available, and there were less than 10 printers available for purchase.   Customer who was in the aisle with us told us to buy what they had because he had been all over our city (at various stores not just WalMart) and there were no other models available and stores couldn't order more printers.  Cashier confirmed that they were running out of printers and that they couldn't order more.  Something to do with the manufacturer.  Same with printer cartridges.  WM has a whole aisle in electronics devoted to printer cartridges and the vast majority have been empty for months.</p>
<p>I know that in the grand scheme of things, dishwashers and printers are not truly essential.  I have had dishwashers break in the past and I know I can wash my dishes by hand.  I know I can write out things by hand.  These machines make my life so much easier, though.  </p>
<p>I wonder how many other "nonessential" machines are not being manufactured, though.  I can live without a dishwasher but I 100% wouldn't want to live without a washing machine or dryer (been there, done that, even with bedding and it SUCKS).   This has transcended communism or socialism or capitalism ... this is some serious WAR RATIONING garbage.  </p>
<p>I'm gonna flip my sh*t the first time someone tells me this is "normal" or we have to live without a dishwasher to "save gramma."</p></p>

        <p>I work for an industrial distribution firm and I can tell you the supply chain is seriously fucked up right now.  We import almost all of our products from China and SE Asia and factories are open, then closed, then open again and once containers get shipped, the COVID restrictions at port really slow things down.  There is also a lack of trucks and drivers so drayage is another problem no one thinks about.  </p>

        <p>My uncle died last October and we wanted to get just a few flowers for his memorial service.  The florist said that there is an international shortage of flowers.  Some of it is because people aren't working to grow/package them because of lockdowns (people aren't sick, they're just not allowed to work), but also for the reasons you mentioned like lack of transportation.</p>
<p>Technically, there are about 33 dishwashers at the local store, because I'm assuming they can sell floor models if they had to.  But it seems like this could cause a ripple effect across all markets and could lead to some dangerous shortages.</p>

        <p>Here's another thing.  I'm in Southern California and we bring in some products from the Pacific Northwest.  It is impossible to get trucks this time of year.  You know why?  The PNW is where Christmas trees are grown and the trees are being shipped out to other states.  There are no trucks available!!!</p>

        <p>I was suprised that the manufacturers have to choose between making dishwashers or ventilators, why not make both?  AFAIK, there are plenty of ventilators, but that could be old information.</p>
