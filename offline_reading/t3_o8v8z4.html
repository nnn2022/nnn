    <strong>Why can't people wrap their heads around the fact that if this carries on the economy will collapse and anyone "saved" by the lockdowns will suffer or die as a result?</strong>
    <p><p>The fucking gurning idiots over at the anti-NNN subs conveniantly ignore the massive toll lockdowns are having on small businesses, people's income and the economy as a whole. If we have another one WE ARE FUCKED. Fucking take your head out of your ass for a moment and question whether lockdowns are really worth it. WHY are they the only solution in tandem with masks and social distancing? It's been over a fucking year and the people enforcing this shit haven't even thought of or developed a better system. That's either because they're fucking lazy or because they're profitting from this. Or, the most likely answer, BOTH.</p>
<p>An overwhelming majority of the population is NOT at risk from this fucking pussy virus yet we are all suffering. I am sick of you utter bastards villifying and gaslighting us. All we want is to go back to normal and have the freedom to decide what we do with our own fucking bodies you fucking assholes! If you want to wear a mask, socially distance, stay inside, watch Netflix for a fucking year, take an experimental "vaccine" and follow all the rules that those who made them aren't even following like a fucking snivelling little simp then BE MY FUCKING GUEST. Just don't expect or demand me to! Oh, and if you're worried about your Gran, she can do the fucking same!</p>
<p>Enough people have had your precious "vaccine" now: SO FUCK OFF. You keep telling people what to do and you are going to get a NASTY fucking response soon enough. This insanity has to fucking end or we will never get back to life pre-2020, and if I'm being completely honest with myself I don't think we will now. All this talk of "Build Back Better" and normalizing fucking stupid shit like face-diapers has totally killed any hope or optimism I had. The light at the end of the tunnel has been snuffed out and replaced with a neon sign pointing towards the nearest vaccination centre for your next booster shot.</p></p>

        <p>Yup the covid 19 pandemic was just the media spin for our dead economy. They have been trying quantative easing for years and its just not working. They literally resorted to helicopter money and its still not enough. We have printed all the money we can. The party is over.</p>

        <p>Exactly this. I am of the belief that covid-19 was a manufactured event in order to distract from the repo market failure in Sept. 2019 which caused massive money printing from the FED which has since gone parabolic.....basically straight up now. They need a massive distraction and the lockdown in order to not go into massive hyperinflation which I think is actually potentially going to cause a massive deflationary event because the money velocity has cratered. </p>
<p>In essence, in trying to save the "economy" they have killed it or put it on a weird form of life support.</p>
<p>Not to mention they have also killed a lot of the shale oil industry which was propping up the oil sector. This whole thing is rigged to blow from what I can see.</p>

        <p>I expect the system to collapse, it's what they want. I am trying to wake husband up. I talk openly about how we always have to keep the cars at least half full with gas in case we have to flee. I always have kept my medication in a bag on purpose, once grabbing it in a fire alarm putting it on my walker with other items. I want to move to a more rural remote area, but it's hard needing so much medical care, I figure that's going to be gone too. They have destroyed our lives, the system is now teetering on the edge.</p>
<p>I don't believe in the system at all anymore. I've had a hellish life outside of my loving marriage and he's suffered too much too. I have been withdrawing, I slap a few art works up on Facebook and say hello on a surface level, but don't feel like talking to anyone anymore though I still go to my Aspie group on Zoom a bit.</p>
<p>I noticed people I know going to some "pride fest", I support gay rights, but I thought the world is burning down...and no one cares. These people I am sure were all vaxxed, festooned in bright colors, guess they haven't heard the "Delta" news yet to panic over and be relocked down yet. Some others were at a BLM related event, the ghetto area here looks so much more poor, it's scary but they think posters and murals are going to fix things. How many homeless are there are going to be when the moratoriums end? I've heard millions. None of the work is coming back. I know our income will very low when unemployment ends and I wonder how long disability will last. I have grown food elsewhere around 5 miles from home offered some gardening space. Wish I could afford to move somewhere with some land around here but that doubles if not triples the rent. </p>
<p>The vaxx supposedly isn't working and is destroying people's health. I think spiritually it's done something to people. Treat all with compassion, but this plagues me. I don't want to hang out with anyone whose gotten it, "spike proteins" etc, but I think of the acquiescence to the system as well. I know if my real thoughts were known they'd be horrified. One group keeps focusing on the "safe" "corporate" sponsored social causes, but I keep thinking why can't we talk about what is going on? I find myself withdrawing a bit there. The group has changed, I was so committed to it, but now the lack of reality, I think why bother? I can't put on smiles and act like life is okay after 2 years of this bullshit. </p>
<p>Husband needs medical procedure this fall, hope system is still up and running in November but don't think it will be for long. I think they want to collapse it all. </p>
<p>Just the loneliness in this all among all the brainwashed, has been horrific. I wonder if I live in hell now. My marriage is the only thing even keeping me going. Otherwise this place is utter shit. </p>
<p>People have to start saying NO, I've turned off all news, and brainwashing factories, the Vaxx is POISON and I expect people to die of it. Some have already. I don't have any hope or optimism. One can see the vaxxed already realizing they got conned, the ones who know about the "new" Delta variant.</p>

        <p>I have said right from March, 2020, when fucking Austria was the first country to lock their borders and others followed their stupidity, that lockdowns, masks and other insanity over a virus with a 99.7% survival rate would cause far more death than Covid ever would.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, half the world is still in lockdown. The economies of countries like Thailand, India, much of the EU, the UK, Brazil etc are heading for freefall, and tens of millions of deaths due to economic hardship/inability to afford basic medical care/suicide will now be the result.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fewer than 4 million have 'supposedly' die due to Covid (and they haven't, as many just happened to be 'supposedly' infected with Covid when they died of something else).</p>
<p>Honestly though, while I understand your anger (and I'm fucking furious!!), all you can do is take care of your own financial situation as best you can, spend ZERO money that you don't have to spend and, if you DO have to spend, do it at small businesses.</p>
<p>Other than that, the world economy will suffer markedly in the coming couple of years, and those that have done their best to take care of their financial health (and, of course, the fuckers that own the major corporations) will be the ones that fare the best at the end of it.</p>

        <p>I've figured it out, actually. It's rather simple. 1) Cognitive Dissonance and 2) Donald Trump. </p>
<p>In one camp, you have those who are too intellectually fragile to handle the massive cognitive dissonance so many are going through right now. Cognitive dissonance has been proven to cause actual PHYSICAL pain. It's why people seek out information to confirm their already existing beliefs. It's the origins of the confirmation bias. These people are incapable of even considering information that contradicts what they have been programmed to believe.</p>
<p>The second camp are those still SO EMOTIONALLY PROGRAMMED to be anti-trump, that the very POSSIBILITY of Trump having been right on so many issues during the pandemic, make these people INCAPABLE of considering the real facts in front of them.</p>
<p>Basically these people are the Cognitive Dissonance PLUS category. </p>
<p>Don't forget to add into the mix the army of AI bots that are a large percentage of the "People" you see posting on those subs. Don't ever underestimate the scale of IIA operations.</p>

        <p>Stock market are records highs, Gold/Silver tanking, housing has reached insane levels and almost all cities have a housing shortage, housing up 10-25%, lumber up 400%, used cars up 50%, can't get a new car.</p>
