    <strong>A win for my kindergartener’s school district...? Maybe.</strong>
    <p><p>We live in Virginia and my 6yo stopped going to school in March. Its been hell for me, for him its like a really long summer vacation but with no trips. Anyway, recently my county’s school board announced that kids will return to school in the fall but they plan on doing “hybrid” learning (some kids will attend in person while others do online and then the kids will switch after a set amount of days/weeks). Obviously I don’t need to remind you how ridiculous that is. So today there was the monthly meeting of the school board (online, of course) where they discussed these new rules and took public comments. Just out of curiosity I decided to download the docket of public comments submitted by parents, teachers, etc... There are <em>27</em> pages of comments (usually theres like 2 pages at most) of parents BEGGING that their kids be sent to school in the fall with no disruptions! I was so amazed!</p>
<p>It seems like the vast majority of people online want to hide their children inside and away from this virus until there’s a vaccine but now I can for sure tell you that is not the case! (at least in my county) There were occasionally people who stated they wanted to leave school online like it is now, but verrrry few. I’m so glad that parents in my district are waking the hell up about this “pandemic” and are genuinely worried for their kids education and mental well-being.</p></p>

        <p>That makes me feel better. Kids need to see faces to develop socially and emotionally. They cannot distance. They aren't "super spreaders". I dont send my kid to school for the superb education, we do a lot of work at home, anyway. I send him for the life lessons he learns on the bus, working with others, etc.</p>

        <p>Yes and no. I thought that the majority of parents in my county would be furious over schools reopening, based on what I see in my cities subreddit. But really, online is not the real world and most of the people in the real world are pretty much over this. The sane people are out there, they’re just silent.</p>

        <p>I listened in on my school board meeting last week and a few mothers called in too, including myself stating this very thing.  Parents are desperate and we still have all summer to get through!</p>

        <p>Well let’s be honest, a lot of parents rather have free day care (school) than pay a actual day care. For others teaching their kids at home wasn’t an easy task as well. (Paying attention or actually doing the assignments). I honestly don’t think people are saying to go full time because the well being of the child, but more for parents to have their “alone” time whatever that is.</p>

        <p>So your concern is, who going to watch my kids while I’m at work? My first point....parents don’t want to pay for daycare. I actually have two boys, but I also work for the school district. I’m prepared for both scenarios and unfortunately it looks like it going to by hybrid for a lot or students. So the concern of “interaction” with others will play a role, however it’s looking it won’t be Monday through Friday.</p>
