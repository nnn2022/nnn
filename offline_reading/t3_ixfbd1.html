    <strong>Are any events still happening? (Concerts, Festivals, Parties etc.)</strong>
    <p><p>So I'm flipping through Youtube and I see the talking heads on the news talking about these super scary biker events happening because of the CV. But then I was thinking, wow they are broadcasting real life and I'm not taking advantage of any of it.  I actually hate motorcycles but I love the idea of things still happening and just being around people that don't give a shit, excuse me, practice common sense and want to continue to live a 'normal' life in a sea of idiocy.</p>
<p>I live in LA and people here are just pathetic. Does anyone know of any other events taking place in any of the Red states particularly? I just need to get away for maybe a week or two and doing things I might have put off before this happened, look more appealing everyday.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></p>

        <p>Bands are starting to play out again in OC, plus some amazing beach parties are happening (look up on Meetup; you'll have to sit through a bunch of online nonsense but it's worth it)</p>
