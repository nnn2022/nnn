    <strong>A doomer who thinks they're an empath</strong>
    <p><p>I got this message (among others) when I questioned a doomer who said that people should be arrested for not wearing a mask. </p>
<p>"I'm also an empath they said wearing a mask shows you care about others and you dont want to spread to some poor senior. Australia is def doing the right thing I know seniors there and they are glad they are a priority unlike the usa."</p>
<p>I replied (BTW, I definitely have my doubts about whether this person is an empath! LMAO): </p>
<p>"Australia is having the police beat people up, and not just for not wearing masks. You think that's the right thing? I question whether you're an empath, then. The wearing a mask because I care about others thing is just media propaganda. They don't really protect others or the person who's wearing them. They're a placebo."</p></p>

        <p>It seems like these days, the most non-empathetic people say they're empaths. I think they get being an "empath" confused with being emotional and angry. An empath can be emotional and angry, but not everyone who's emotional and angry is an empath.</p>

        <p>I don't think empathy exist.  It's always the most self righteous fucks who don't actually understand how the other person's life is.  They're just getting attention by telling people how badly they feel about something.  They've never tried to fix it, they don't volunteer, they just cry.</p>

        <p>I sort of agree... empathy is supposed to be about caring about someone ELSE, but these people who keep claiming they're empaths constantly seem to only care about (and blubber about) their OWN feelings. "Wear a mask to protect me because I'm soooo scared! I'm such a SENSITIVVEEEEEE PERSONNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!! I want to save livesssssssss!!" Then, in the next breath: "Oh, you have COPD and can't breathe in the mask? Well, f*ck you then. Your life isn't the type of life I want to saveeeeeeee!!!!</p>

        <p>Exactly.  I know some compassionate people, but they don't cry on SM, they go teach in poor schools, they volunteer for causes, they donate money.  They, you know, <em>help people</em>.  </p>
<p>Empathy, in my view, doesn't actually exist.  Not that you can't have empathy, but that empathy and empath as terms have been co-opted almost entirely by narcissists who find ever more public ways to make other people's suffering about them.  I'm turned off by the very word, it's almost a red flag because of the number of times I've seen "empathy" used as a way to talk down to anyone who disagrees, or to seek attention for themselves.  It's unfortunately promoted as a super-emotion, it's supposed to be better than sympathy or compassion.  People are told to teach their kids empathy.  But, again, the sympathetic and compassionate people out there actually help.  They go fix things and build thing and donate and so on.</p>

<p>They want people to think they are good and righteous and pure (and they want to feel that they are those things), but they don't want to put in any actual effort.</p>

        <p>What is inherently wrong with the right wing? Maybe they are correct about some things. They are also generally opposed to lockdowns, but are accused of having totalitarian leaders by the left. This is no longer about politics it's simply good and bad people at this point.</p>

        <p>I think a lot of people confuse the word "empathy" with "sympathy". Empathy means that you understand how someone else feels, usually from having been through it yourself. For example, an abuse victim reaching out to another abuse victim since they experienced similar trauma. I bet none of these self-professed "empaths" even know anyone who died a horrible death from Covid-19 alone. Nor do they have empathy towards those who have lost their jobs, had their lives ruined, medical care neglected, ect because they can't relate. After all, they haven't left their house in months and have been working from home and they're fine so that must mean that everybody else is fine, too. </p>
<p>Sympathy, however, is feeling sorry for people. "I feel sorry for the poor elderly grandmas who will die the moment they breathe in the virus so I stay home and wear a mask when I walk outside alone". "I feel sorry for the people who had family members die so I'm doing my part to stop the spread". It's way more performative and theatrical, which is what a lot of these people seem to thrive on.</p>

        <p>I don't think were disagreeing here.  I'm not saying that the concept is impossible, I'm saying that the word has been coopted completely enough To make it basically a way to signal your virtue, and quite often a red flag to say that you actually aren't that nice.  It ends up being all about them, how they're making sympathetic noises (with no action, of course) about the problems of other people (and often performatively post about it on social media for likes). If they cared , really truly cared, they wouldn't just be talking about how it makes <em>them</em> feel, they'd be doing something.  I see this all over my social media.  Turn your feed black to show empathy to blacks.  Cool, fine.  But these same people have never actually done anything, never will, and as soon as the trend changes, they'll be back to posting mommy needs wine and food gifs.  That's not actually empathy, but they use the term because that term is used by the schools and the media.</p>
<p>I use the term compassion personally because it isn't coopted.  Compassion still has the silly idea that it's the other person's needs and desires that count.  The compassionate will look at people losing jobs and start giving to food banks, or will see grandma at risk and get extra groceries for the elderly so they don't have to go out.  They'll donate large print books to nursing homes, or games or something.  That's compassion.</p>

        <p>I'm currently arguing with people who say that 1) masks help them breathe better, and 2) they don't make it any worse, even though they've been in an oxygen tent. These are both asthmatics. I don't dispute the fact that the person has been in an oxygen tent, but I think their asthma must have improved since then, if they can tolerate a mask.</p>

        <p>I have a friend on facebook who is like that. She's always talking about being an empath and "caring about her community", which of course now means staying at home and wearing masks. She posts things like saying how sad it makes her that others don't care about the community like she does. </p>

        <p>Yeah, if a person really cared about their community, they'd be out helping at a food bank or something. (Although "empath" stay-at-home-ers like to use the excuse that their mild asthma immunocompromises them... meanwhile, I've been out the entire time... and if you're so empathetic, your desire to help would trump your immunocompromization, I would think).</p>

I did tell someone that I volunteer and they could use more help if she wanted to join and she said she hasn’t really even left her property since March!

        <p>I care about making sure the world my nephews grow up in isn't a dystopian hellscape, where people aren't allowed to breathe freely or smile at other people in public. Where children are denied the right to normal social interaction with other children and a lot of critical communication is hidden and lost behind pieces of cloth, without even having any positive effect on health. I want them to have what I did - freedom to run around and play outside, to make silly faces and make people laugh, to interact with others without some medical authority swooping in to try to shame and scare everyone out of a normal life.</p>

        <p>What, my words were not eloquent?  Haha jk.  My Bible trivia is not great, but I can take a guess.  Probably something about going to your room and closing your doors while praying instead of out in the town square for everyone to see?  Like how good is your good deed if your primary purpose for the deed is to let the world know about it so they can see what a good person you are.</p>

        <p>Except placebo works sometimes</p>
<p>I think the problem is this beep-boop black-white thinking, like we "are" in a pandemic. Masks "help". It's not a question of <em>how much</em> they help and whether they bring any drawbacks. It's just whether they help or not help. Not even that, whether they <em>potentially</em> help. And I'm actually pretty sure some people knowingly lie about the facts and science, because they feel that they have the right to because saving lives has priority over truth and transparency. They just don't realize they aren't saving anyone, only mashing a button that has "save lives" written on it basically. That's not even getting the sentiments like "I'm wearing it though I don't enjoy it, why is that guy isn't?".</p>
<p>Or alterantively it's the Rotschilds, and they are creating a <em>visibility</em> that we the people are bringing this on ourselves. While we fight among each other they get richer.</p>

        <p>I don't think anyone would really care or be having this debate if masks weren't being forced. It's the mandatory wearing that is the problem, I personally couldn't care less if the rest of the population decide to walk around with goldfish bowls over their heads as long as I'm not forced to.  Gives me a useful indicator for who the idiots are so I can avoid them, which is how I looked at the very few people I saw wearing them prior to mandates.</p>

        <p>Or more than that, just worrying about "masks" in general.  A gas mask (with the right filters) should theoretically stop more virus particles than an N95 mask, and a surgical mask is better or worse (I forget which) than one of those.  All would be better than a poorly-fitted homemade virtue signal bashed together from unknown materials, or a random scarf/bandana.  An SCBA is the only thing that will provide complete protection.  This should be obvious to anyone with a lick of sense, but any of them will work to get past most mask mandates.  One airline recently banned the ones with exhaust vents; other than that I haven't heard anything.</p>
<p>That alone should tell you that this is more about keeping people afraid than it is about saving lives.</p>

As an empath on an aggregate level I’ve been feeling a sadness and frustration growing, festering. Individuals are, well individuals run the gamut based on beliefs and current (imposed) fear level.</p>
<p>If you believe in masks and feel empathy, that would lead someone to the conclusion that wearing a mask makes them empathetic to a cause. Here it’s called virtue signalling. This is not the same thing as having an empathic sensitivity.</p>

        <p>It's absolutely sickening that they claim to be these virtuous, empathic, selfless beings. The absolute, shameless gall. The cult of covid wouldn't know empathy if it hit them in the face. They are the most vile, selfish, hypocritical parasites in the universe. The whole virtue-signaling culture that social media created is so empty and fake. Plus, everything these sanctimonious imbeciles believe is a result of being massively brainwashed and having no thinking skills to question any of the absurd bullshit they love to eat up.</p>
