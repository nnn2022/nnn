    <strong>Question about masks [serious]</strong>
    <p><p>What is going on with a couple that you are out where one is wearing a mask and the other isn’t? Wouldn’t you both be in agreement one way or another? And even if you aren’t, the supposed reason why they are wearing them is to “protect others” right? So is the mask wearer ok with the non-wearer going out in public without it? If that’s the case, the whole thing is shattered. Especially if you live together. If the mask wearer has it, and is asymptomatic, wouldn’t they just infect the non-wearer immediately and then then the non-wearer spreads it around? How does the logic work when two people are in disagreement but both go out beboping around together? Just trying to figure out the new rules.</p></p>

        <p>No no, you're looking at this wrong. If you're participating in a State approved activity you actually decrease the spread of covid. If and only if it's State approved, got it?</p>

        <p>Women are more influenced by social approval and usually don't want to be seen as selfish and uncaring. This is how we're socialized. </p>
<p>The women in my family tend to be extremely concerned with "what will people think" and I always chafed against this growing up. I think having that message drilled into me when I was young has influenced me to an extreme to not care what people's opinions of me are.</p>
<p>I'm a woman who doesn't wear a mask and I could give two shits what anyone thinks about it. I also have no issues being confrontational with people or standing my ground when I'm challenged socially. </p>
<p>I would say I'm an outlier among most women because I literally don't care if people think I'm selfish and uncaring or an asshole or what. They don't know me. I'm actually a really nice person and I'm very polite but I'm not putting up with anyone's bullshit.</p>
<p>But yeah I can see how the woman would not want to rock the boat even if her partner doesn't care. Because we have the pressure to make people "comfortable" drilled into us our whole lives.</p>

        <p>This was me and my gf for the first couple months. She claimed she felt like she was being judged if she didn’t wear one, going as far as driving back home because she forgot it on a grocery run. Shows how some people are literally only doing this to conform with the heard.</p>

        <p>My spouse and I are very much not in agreement on this.  By their own admission, sometimes it’s about how doing a thing feels.  It will be interesting if our state ends up requiring it (which I suspect is coming next week).</p>

        <p>I wear a mask, my wife doesn’t. If we’re asymptomatic my mask will reduce the overall exposure of anyone who comes around even if it’s not eliminated. It’s not worth ending the marriage over.</p>
