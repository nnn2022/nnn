    <strong>The constant comparisons to WW2 that I see from reddit/twitter makes me sick.</strong>
    <p><p>They love comparing the lockdowns/erosion of our basic human rights to "doing your patriotic duty" during a fucking world war lmfao.</p>
<p>These nerds have watched way too many movies. I swear they're all suffering from main character syndrome. They think that during the apocalypse, they'll be Rick Grimes or Mad Max, when in reality they'll just be another dead idiot or some poor soul tied to the hood of a car.</p></p>

        <p>Holy shit yes. It seems to be a go to for these people.  To compare 2 completely different situations as if it makes sense.  My grandparents lived through ww2 and I'm certain that they would have had  a balanced view on all of this. Plus, family and friends was absolutely everything to my grandad.  He was in a care home for the last few years of his life and  not being able to see others or have physical contact with them would have absolutely destroyed him. </p>
<p>Being ok with social isolation has nothing to do with bravery. It's a difference in personalities.  Just because you are ok with not seeing people, doesn't mean that everyone else is.</p>

        <p>The Nazis segregated the Jews out of fear. I'm being told to stay in my home and being segregated due to fear. The comparisons are ripe for the picking. </p>
<p>I need a certificate of health, just as under the Nazi regime they need certificates that they weren't Hebrew. </p>
<p>There are buildings in every nation in which concentrated groups of people are taken against their will, and not allowed to leave. You could call them "camps", I suppose. </p>
<p>We are only allowed to speak about the situation as long as it aligns with the official narrative. 
Nazis had the most sophisticated propaganda program in the world at that point. </p>
<p>We are creating special groups of people to police and track the movement of others. I don't feel as if I need to spell out the parallel there, as it's gotta be obvious. SS</p>
<p>We are asking people to turn in their neighbors or families for gathering. That's literally a Nazi tactic. </p>
<p>Once you realize that the Nazis won WWII, and just defected to America to create our government programs, the parallels are much easier to understand. Look into project paperclip.</p>
