    <strong>About those "vaccines"</strong>
    <p><p>It's important to remember: words mean things. They symbolize a person's conceptualization of something. In the case of the word "vaccine", most people immediately think of those shots they received as a young child, shots that only hurt for a moment but gave them immunity-for-life from some dread disease. </p>
<p>The shots that they are giving for COVID? Those are not vaccines.</p>
<p>They aren't made like regular vaccines, they don't work like regular vaccines, and in fact it could be argued that they don't really work at all. </p>
<p>What do I mean by that? Well, you can still get infected from COVID even if you're vaccinated, and you can still spread COVID to others even if you're vaccinated. The only real advantage to the jab is that it mitigates symptoms. So in reality, it's an experimental therapeutic medicine (albeit a therapeutic that you have to take prophylactically). </p>
<p>So why are the government and the drug companies calling them vaccines then? It's simple, really. People are much more likely to resist being injected with an experimental gene therapy than they are a vaccine, so they are calling them "vaccines" instead of "experimental gene therapies". </p>
<p>It's a moniker for marketing purposes only. The Big Lie about these experimental shots - which are being pushed on the population of the entire planet by every non-assassinated world leader - is that they are even vaccines at all. </p>
<p>So the next time you find yourself in a discussion about these injections, don't accept the bullshit premise that it's "vaccines" being talked about. Call them what they actually are: <em>experimental gene therapies</em>.</p></p>
