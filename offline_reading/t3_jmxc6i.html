        <p>I knew this was coming but I literally cannot comprehend how you have to wear a fucking mask EVEN IF YOU CAN SOCIAL DISTANCE. this is not what they were saying before!! why is there a fucking curfew!! i cant understand any of this and i am panicking because i know its only going to get worse from here. i seriously cannot survive another lockdown and they are preparing us for it.</p>
<p>edit: why the fuck can liquor stores stay open after 9:30 but cant sell alcohol after 9:30??? why can restaurants still do take out but no more alcohol?? where are these rules even coming from?? what does this have to do with covid??? im fucking so bullshit right now</p>

        <p>This is what happens when healthy people get tested. Why are people still getting tested if they're not sick? Also how do they know the hospitalizations aren't the flu?</p>
<p>"The data suggests that if we don’t ramp up the fight to disrupt rising trends, we will have a serious problem on our hands in the not too distant future,” Baker explained. “The state government’s ability to stop a pandemic is nothing compared to the power of individual choice.” </p>
<p>Well doesn't look like individuals have a choice...</p>

        <p>Even if you're mildly ill, why get tested? Its not like you'll get different treatment if you test positive. If you're sick, treat it as you would any other illness. Except these dumbasses would travel with a full-blown flu and wipe their noses on airline seats before the news told them they're all going to die from a cold.</p>

        <p>Not only that but the PCR tests were not made for this purpose and can have a lot of false positives. That makes the test results nearly meaningless and wasteful.</p>
<p>One time in March I was thinking about getting an anti bodies test for this. I read through their privacy notices and one part said that information from this test can be shared to local authorities or government if required by law. That was the deal breaker for me so I decided not to get it. I just wanted to see my results but did not want the government to see them with all of the hysteria behind this.</p>
