    <strong>Going Insane</strong>
    <p><p>Today I asked my mom If I could take a walk around the neighborhood, and she said no.
Why?
Because SOMEONE I WALK PASS MIGHT NOT BE WEARING A MASK
I HAVENT LEFT THE HOUSE IN 5 FUCKING MONTHS</p>
<p>I am to young to move out of my house, so I have no choice but to rot in my house.
My parents says its for our health. Even though we are all obese ( if you REALLY cared about your health, wouldn’t you change your lifestyle,mom?)
Even when it doesnt kill us, I doubt my parents would be healthy enough to watch us graduate without long term diet changes. How often is it that you see a morbidly obese 70 year old?
 I am going insane. School is online. I have nit seen anyone outside of my family personally for 5 MONTHS.
She is being retarded, but I wouldn’t expect much more from her, she gets her news from Reddit.
I still love her, i just dont think she is very smart.</p>
<p>Dont mind my username, this is just a throwaway. Sorry if this rant is incoherent, just needed to say this.</p></p>

        <p>How old are you? My kids are teens. If they want to go for a walk they usually tell me, not ask. I hope you can talk to a friend from school and make plans to meet somewhere - even if it’s the grocery store. </p>
<p>This lockdown is abusive if we can’t just go out.</p>

        <p>I don’t know how old you are, but I’m going to assume you’re between the ages of 11-17. If that’s the case, sneak out and hang out with friends, get exercise, don’t follow the tyrannical rules. I’ve been doing it and I’ve had many amazing moments, all while my crazy parents think covid will kill us all if we disobey lord faucis gospel. Trust me, you won’t regret it.</p>

        <p>That would be a good idea if I lived in the country side, but I live in a city where it would probably be better to not roam at night alone( especially since we own no guns). My best friend also lives across town. Im never raising my kids in the city, it sucks here. Thanks for the suggestion though. I hope you have fun with your friends :)</p>

        <p>I’m so, so sorry. This honestly reminds me of when my family wouldn’t let me get food because they were afraid I’d get covid from the workers. I’m not sure what advice I can offer to make you feel better, because I know how horribly miserable everything is right now :( And of course it’s not healthy to be inside all day, there’s countless studies that prove this. I’m so sorry you have to go through all of this.</p>

        <p>Consider asserting yourself. You don’t have to be hateful or rebellious in tone. Just say you need to take a walk, or meet a friend, and that you will be back at this time. If they are highly reactive or abusive, that’s another story entirely. </p>
<p>But if they are keeping you there with guilt and pleading... you have a choice to decline engaging with that, and to opt for self care and sanity.</p>

        <p>My mom would never hit me, but I would probably get a bad word ridden screaming at and have my electronics taken away ( which would be fine, the internet has nothing worth looking at, but its my only form of communication with my friends). Thaks for the suggestion though :)</p>

        <p>It disgusts me that a parent could not let their child out of the house for 5 months. Incredibly harmful mentally and physically. I'm sorry, I would suggest walking out but I realise this would make things far worse for you. Rant away, I hope your parents let up soon.</p>

        <p>How old are you kid? I can think of very few peers that didn't defy their parents when we were kids. It's what kids should do. If you want to go for a walk, do it. Do what feels right and once you turn 18, more opportunities will open up.</p>
<p>I was raised in a very religious (Jewish) house. One of the big rules in the house was only kosher food was allowed in. When I was 10, had no money, and no way to get around, I wanted to rebel but couldn't. But I'll tell you, as soon as I had some money and some wheels, I got out and got me a God damn cheeseburger and snuck it into my room.</p>

        <p>All of my friends come from a childhood just like yours.  It's what I admire about them.  They are all intelligent, successful men who came from unintelligent, trashy families whom they love dearly but had to escape for any hope of success.</p>
<p>Hang in there.  Unfortunately, your childhood isn't something you're ever going to look back fondly on.  However, if as an adult you choose to overcome that upbringing, your adulthood will be the greatest time of your life.  This is something that most people don't get to enjoy.</p>
<p>What would you rather have be the best time of your life - the first 18 years or the last 65?</p>
