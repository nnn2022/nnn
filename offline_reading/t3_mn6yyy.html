        <p>As someone who refuses to wear masks, I can tell you that I am not spending any less or any more money.  I am spending it differently.  </p>
<p>Where I used to spend money:</p>
<p>Restaurants, Local retail stores, Movie theaters, Gym membership, Sporting events, Bars, Airlines, Hotels, Fishing, kayaking, trekking, museums, other tours of historic monuments, and Tourism destination cities with all of the above</p>
<p>How I spend money now:  </p>
<p>Home improvement, Guns, Ammunition, Range time &amp; gun club membership, At home gym equipment, Liquor and meat delivery, Curbside pickup of groceries &amp; beer, Amazon</p>
<p>I could go on, but the point is that masks, anti-social distancing, and all the other COVID illusion of safety bullshit measures don't stop economic activity, but they certainly shift it.  Government policy created winners and losers.  </p>
<p>Do you honestly think masks help our economy grow?</p>

        <p>Some people are touched enough to think "Well, if EVERYBUUUUDY blore tasks, the economy would EXPLODE!"</p>
<p>No. What would make the economy explode in a good way is to BAN masking except for people like my deceased father who had a REASON to wear a mask, i.e. he was a transplant patient before the astounding lack of medical care that lead to his death.</p>

        <p>What MADE the economy explode was President Trump's America First agenda.  Low corporate tax rates (which fake President Sleepy Joe is already trying to reverse), repatriation of manufacturing, and a general reignition of the American dream.</p>
<p>The Leftists couldn't have that.  They saw how effective the CCP lockdowns were in canceling pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong.  Amazing how quickly they pivoted from Orange Man xenophobe to "shut it all down, no MAGA rallies, and mail-in voting--for your safety!"</p>
<p>Leftist, nanny-statists like OP don't want to acknowledge the economic devastation of governmental reaction to the virus.  FFS, just about every economy on the planet contracted in 2020, save one.  Guess which one?</p>

        <p>This sub is meant to be non-partisan and to promote healthy, civil debate rather than woke name-calling (Nanny-statists? Really?). You can get lost and go back to Tumblr with your political hatred and Trump Derangement Syndrome. You SJWs let Trump live rent-free in your heads, you can't go a day without thinking about him or bringing him up in conversations that have nothing to do with him (such as this one).</p>

        <p>&rt; Do you honestly think masks help our economy grow?</p>
<p>Yes, I've seen enough research that suggests that masks are good for the economy during these times. Unfortunately, it's the kind of research that never gets airtime from the Lamestream Woke fake news sites such as Rebel News and Breitbart, because it goes against their fear-mongering SJW narrative that masks are a tool of OpPrEsSiOn and TyRaNnY. Oh well.</p>

        <p>Did anyone look at the actual graphs? The least-squares lines are barely sloping in the desired direction.</p>
<p>The authors don't quantify anything in the literature. But they do say, for example, that consumer mobility increased by 1%, over 11 weeks, after mask requirements went into place. (At least I think it's 1%. They didn't tell us what the <em>x</em>-axis measures.) Among the 4 authors no one explained how "consumer mobility" is quantified, nor what a 1% increase in it means. </p>
<p>Did they isolate every other variable? Is it possible that consumers got 1% more mobile (over 11 weeks) for any number of reasons? (Perhaps the mask mandates in their particular jurisdictions supplanted stay-at-home orders, which would necessarily increase "consumer mobility.") What about the 4th graph: where spending increased by ".15" over the same period. Again, is that 15%? Whatever the measured increase actually is, the authors admit they got this data from "credit card spending". Well, if I can't leave my house, and the businesses are closed, then of course I'm going to order shit off Amazon (with my credit card). Cash spending almost certainly took a nosedive over that same period. </p>
<p>The 5th graph might be the least helpful of all. Are the data points the 136 counties that have implemented mask mandates without their states doing so? And what do the positions of the data points mean with respect to the <em>y</em>-axis? For instance, there's a point all by itself at -.2 on the x-axis and "40 days after implementation" on the y-axis. What was going on in that particular county 10, 20, 30, 50 days after implementation? Why is the point static? </p>
<p>Point 2 is an opinion survey. That's not science. It's also preposterous, with questions like "How much more or less likely would you be to go out to a store if cases fell 10%?" Respondents are going to answer the question because someone is asking them the question. But no one makes decisions like this in real life. Even the most ardent pro-masker isn't measuring official case numbers before heading to Walmart: instead, they'll just put on a mask, maybe a face shield, smother themselves in hand sanitizer and hope for the best. </p>
<p>Finally, Point 1 (sorry I'm not doing these in numerical order) is also unclear. What are the data points? Are you telling me that a certain county had a decrease of 6 cases per 100,000 population, 19 days after masks were mandated? Why measure only that particular day? </p>
<p>This study, although aesthetically pleasing and full of approved media/government talking points, and despite being assembled by 4 Ph.D.s (3 finance, 1 engineering), doesn't show the slightest evidence of a correlation - let alone a causation - between mask-wearing and economic activity.</p>

        <p>I can confirm that masks make me buy everything online and give zero money to small businesses so I can avoid wearing the stupid thing and worrying about breaking pointless rules. The places I do go to like convenience stores for snacks, I spend much less time and spend less money so I can get out and take the mask off.</p>
