<p>The worst thing that's happened to my life during all of this is having to pay for masks which on the grand scale of my life is minor. And I guess no large Thanksgiving but yeah. Not 1984.</p>

        <p>If you really understand what 1984 was really about should be able to realize what they are doing. Here are some comparisons you've missed (my bad if it's a little lenghty, I wanted to include as much as possible).</p>
<p>"Flu cases are almost non-existent this year because of masks, social distancing and lockdowns!" Oh so why is covid running rampant then? "Because so many people aren't wearing masks and refuse to follow the rules!" </p>
<p>This is typical 1984 Orwellian doublethink. </p>
<p>"The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command." </p>
<p>The most undeniable fact is that this is a 0.2% IFR (Infection Fatality Rate) common respiratory virus that didn't warrant any of these draconian measures (lockdowns, etc.). Never forget <em>that</em> is the prime fact, and they are always trying to obscure it. This whole thing is a dystopian false narrative that has made the populace believe a mild respiratory virus is a plague. That is the main talking point here. You know the truth about this virus, then the entire narrative comes crashing down.</p>
<p>The "experts" still operate on the basis that this is aerosolized ebola...not on the undeniable basis that it's a respiratory virus with a similar IFR to the flu. </p>
<p>The media deliberately feeds the masses misinformation and a false narrative. 24/7 blaring fearmongering. Thus, like the government in 1984, they program people into being mindless zombies who love their slavemasters. The media constantly spews the most absurd things ever...like how this virus has a mortality rate of 5%, and how it causes permanent damage to every system in the human body, and then they present extreme outliers by cherry picking the 0.01% of young healthy people who get this virus and die and act like this is commonplace. And they do this constantly. It's pure disinformation, and it's nefarious as hell. </p>
<p>The WHO came out and said that 10% of the human population has already had covid (this literally confirmed that covid is a relatively mild virus since the IFR is therefore extremely low). In the next sentence, they advocated for lockdowns, masks, testing, tracing, and all that dystopian shit. The level of how much this resembles 1984 is surreal. They know they can literally admit this is a 0.2% IFR virus while at the same time acting like it's an unprecedented plague that requires all these draconian measures. This is how brazen they are. And this is how horrifically dumb the population is.</p>
<p>The CDC also constanly acts like they don't know the difference between CFR and IFR, and other obvious things about virology and epidemiology. They deliberately play dumb and feed an extremely ignorant and gullible public misinformation. It's like the damn Ministry of Truth in <em>1984</em>.</p>
<p>State-sponsored "protests" during a "deadly global pandemic" that "demands" a myriad of draconian restrictions and rules. Insane levels of hypocrisy, cognitive dissonance, mental gymnastics...the same people who love lockdowns and claim that covid is such a dangerous and deadly virus are the ones that go out by the thousands to March shoulder-to-shoulder...all while calling a backyard barbecue a "superspreading" event and destroying every facet of society where kids aren't even allowed to go to school, restaurants and shops that have ten customers at a time can't even be open, and people can't even go to a park. It truly doesn't get more 1984 than that.</p>
<p>You also have to remember the fact how countries were talking about containment...while completely ignoring the pink and purple elephant in the room, that:
1. This is a low IFR virus and 
2. Lockdowns, and all the other crap like test and trace don't work for viruses like this, they are simply to easily transmissible and mild, with an extremely high number of asymptomatics. This is why we never had such a stupid response to any other respiratory virus. </p>
<p>Trying to contain a virus like covid is as futile as trying to contain influenza or common cold viruses...Funny how all the "experts" forgot this in March of 2020.</p>
<p>And look at how they literally programmed the masses to go from "please no one wear masks because it's unnecessary and might just make it worse" in the first three months of 2020 to a total complete reversal literally overnight of "everyone wear masks at all times, masks are the best weapon against this terrible virus". If that's not horrifyingly Orwellian enough, I don't know what to say. 
It is horrifyingly Orwellian how the "experts" changed the narrative and literally reprogrammed the public overnight. Just like the Ministry of Truth in 1984.</p>
<p>It should be more than obvious by now that everything concerning this virus is a massive break from all protocol and sanity. What has happened this March 2020 has <em>never</em> been the rational, scientific consensus in how to deal with a respiratory virus. Why do you think there's never been a pandemic response like this before?</p>
<p>And what did we get out of all this?</p>
<p>Children's education and development is being ruined. The economy is crashed, dozens of different sectors bankrupted (consequently there's been severe increases in deaths from starvation, overdoses, suicides, etc.). Millions have lost their jobs and careers, and businesses. Millions around the world sink deeper into poverty. People are giddily using and disposing of more plastics and waste than ever with their stupid mask and other covid theater obsessions (shows how the never truly have a damn about animals and the environment). This insanity has caused immense mental anguish all over the world and we've all been condemned to this dystopian hell. Normality is now literally being held hostage and dependent on them injecting everyone with Big Pharma's rushed vaccine...a vaccine for a literal cold virus that you have to prove you got just so you can be allowed to work or get on a plane. Meanwhile...someone can have ebola and board a plane...</p>
<p>Millions of idiots are now brainwashed to be afraid of a mild virus...Half of people now believe this is a totally normal, sane, scientific response to a virus. They are irrationally afraid of respiratory viruses that humans have lived with (and thrived) for thousands of years. The other half are like us...our psyches tormented by anguish and despair as we look upon a world gone mad, a world that has undergone a total psychotic break that unfolds around us. We now live with the terrifying knowledge that the media and government can impose this tyranny on a whim. They have done it so easily, and seeing this, what is to stop them from doing in the future the next time a glorified low IFR cold or flu virus comes along? We now live in an Orwellian novel, where doublethink and doublespeak prevail, anything that contradicts the false narrative is effectively dismissed and silenced, the truth has indeed become treason in this empire of hideous lies.</p>
<p>It's truly absurd &amp; surreal how the hideous, psychotic response to this virus, and the Orwellian novel become real life aspect of it all...the "science is what the anointed ones day it is"...how everything got rewritten literally overnight (and not just about masks, but everything else about viruses and epidemiology) and everyone just accepted it. And scientists that went against it got actively ridiculed, dismissed and ultimately silenced.</p>
<p>Remember that everything that we see today, all the insanity, the immense damage and wanton destruction, this entire hellish waking nightmare...none of this was caused by this weak virus. All of it was caused by society's absolutely idiotic, psychotic, disgusting reaction to it. A manufactured crisis that makes the ignorant masses so irrationality afraid that they gleefully accept fascism and beg for more.</p>
<p>I wish people had actually analyzed and understood those dystopian books that were required reading in school...then maybe they would have recognized the huge, glaring warning signs of implementation of a dystopia back in the spring. But alas, here we are in this nightmare. Orwell was right. The masses can literally be reprogrammed overnight to accept anything. What was absurd just a little more than a year ago is now accepted by the masses as truth and logic. It's like people don't have memory of life and the world prior to March 2020.</p>

        <p>It shouldn't be hard to notice how this whole mess is being taken advantage of financially &amp; politicially and in terms of power. </p>
<p>But, the reason how this money &amp; power grab started in the first place is stupidy. You heard me right, I'll explain.</p>
<p>Which country introduced lockdowns? Why was that specific country, the only country that had "bodies dropping dead on the street" &amp; "successfully eliminated" the virus back in February of 2020, and hasn't had significant outbreaks since? That country surely had no benefit at all to delude the rest of the world into crashing their economies, right? They would never want to hurt our economies and unravel our society. Nope, they just wanted to bestow their benevolence upon us and "save" us all from a such a "deadly" low IFR virus. </p>
<p>The whole world took the bait. That is how this started.</p>
<p>It should be more than obvious by now that they lied by first making the world believe that this virus was way more deadly than it actually is and then providing the "solution" to such a "terrible threat"...lockdowns and everything they entail, including masks, social distancing, contact tracing, the whole dystopian hellscape. Oh, the lockdown didn't work? You still haven't eradicated covid yet? That's because you didn't do it right! You need to lockdown harder, longer, more stringently! Oh you <em>still</em> haven't gotten rid of covid? That's because people aren't doing what they're told, they aren't following the rules (scapegoating of "anti-maskers" is born)! Now lockdown again harder, even more draconian policies. </p>
<p>This is the never-ending cycle of stupidity &amp; insanity. They just fed the world a series of inane propaganda images and that was all it took. It's cunning and masterful. The fact that something as absurd as lockdowns is now seen as a totally normal and sane response, backed by "science" speaks volumes about what went down here. It's overnight reprogramming. Psychological warfare. The fact that all these countries fell for it says a multitude of things about how their governments, media, population, and society operate. </p>
<p>By now, surely all these "experts", shills and quacks know that this virus isn't aerosolized ebola, or even on the level of original SARS. They know it's a 0.2% IFR virus, and they know the nature of what it really is, and that trying to contain it is as futile as trying to contain a common cold. But they still deliberately act like the complete opposite...because they are far too deep into this psychosis to back out now. They now see no way to get out of it and still save face, except with this Orwellian dystopian tactic of keeping up the false narrative for as long as possible. They cover for their own asses and don't care how much damage and destruction they are causing. </p>
<p>For the nefarious politician, it has the effect of being able to enact restrictions and wield power they could have only ever dreamed of. You combine these things  (extremely brainwashed populace caused by shameless lying media+power-hungry politicians) and you have the perfect storm of mass psychosis we are witnessing.</p>
<p>For everybody else with any kind of wealth and power? They haven't lost any money.</p>
<p>The big retailers have made bank because small businesses (AKA the competition) have been destroyed (some billionaires have literally tripled their networth).</p>
<p>Online delivery and Amazon are making bank because people are too afraid to shop in the real world due to all of the fearmongering. </p>
<p>As the economy dies, all of the seized and repossessed assets (like homes) will come up on the market for pennies on the dollar - to be held and flipped for profit later. </p>
<p>Tech companies are making a killing building our new social credit/surveillance dystopia. </p>
<p>At the beginning of 2020, 1% of the world richest owned 44% of the world's wealth. By now they own 70% already (one of the biggest wealth transfers in history).</p>
<p>Everyone wins. Except Joe Average.</p>

        <p>I actually didn’t, its been on the ‘to-read’ list for awhile and i dunno why but for some reason, escaping a dystopia to read about a dystopia just doesn’t sound fun.</p>

        <p>I reread it this year and it kind of helped in a weird way. There are obvious parallels to what's happening now, and it reassured me that this is not normal.</p>

        <p>America had a fucking amazing epidemic in the 50s and 60s where kids would get paralized and needed iron lungs to breathe. Scientists made a fucking vaccine in months and no one complained, it ended the suffering. Your grandparents remember polio... Was it normal then to have a massive pandemic? Or is it just covid?</p>

        <p>For fucks sake, you people really dont know any history, do you? What is not normal for you? We had like 1000+ great outbrakes, pandemics, eoidemics of hundereds of diseases. From measles to the plague or small pox. There are cities and countries in Europe and Asia that were hundereds of years in quarantine. We had a fucking world wide pandemic like 100 years ago that killed 100 M people. Its normal and it happens all the fucking time since we have civilization. We have a fucking century of death by pandemic in europe that is called the black death. Why are you people so ignorant on history and having a memory of a goldfish?</p>

        <p>Twitter is cancer and a drug. It's the worst. Something like less than 10% of the users are responsible for more than 90% of the posts.</p>
<p>Staying off social media is one of the healthiest things a person can do these days. Read a book. Go outside. Life has so much more to offer :)</p>
