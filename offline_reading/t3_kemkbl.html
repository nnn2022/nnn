    <strong>What is really at the root of the pathological selflessness we see in people who advocate for lockdowns?</strong>
    <p><p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sort of an off my chest type of thing, but whatever.</p>
<p>Think about this. Remember when the hot phrase was "No one should die because you need a haircut, KAREN". Or what about those who are completely elative over the fact that they can wear pajama pants to work, or not have to go out at all? Appointments (This is mildly understandable) via zoom. No longer eating out with friends, or paying super high prices for door dash? No movies, bars, bowling, malls, concerts, TRAVELING? Missing friends, dating opportunities, support groups, any social gatherings, clubs?</p>
<p>I guess my point is - What type of person is okay with all of this just going away? I feel like Patrick out of SpongeBob "WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?".</p>
<p>This cannot be that they are all so committed to flattening the curve BRAH and I doubt it's that they're frozen in fear. Good god, I never EVER viewed myself as someone who was a socialite but damn. Are there really this many people who just have no intentions of living? No aspirations or desire to accomplish anything, no matter how small the scale? To go on a date in a social setting around other people or go bowling with some buddies? </p>
<p>Fuck, even looking at it in the least critical light - what kind of person doesn't want to even get a haircut? There's just no way this is about giving up their life to save others. They're not loaded onto a higgins boat getting gunned down by MG42's at Normandy. Is it all about facilitating a culture of laziness?</p></p>

        <p>I know a Doomer that literally said our society is crap and has to be broken down to be built into something better. No, Doomer, it'll break down so much that it won't even be as good as the time when you thought it was crap. It'll be continuously much worse than that.</p>

        <p>A lot of it has to do with conformity and virtue signaling. Another aspect that I don't see discussed often here is punishment/reward conditioning. In todays 1st world most people have not reached the stage of psychological development which was formerly considered adulthood. They have been conditioned through education, media and entertainment to always defer to authority and thus actually do not see themselves as their own authority.</p>

        <p>I dont do any of the social activities you named and I cut my own hair. I only enjoy outdoor activities or things I can do away from others.
However, I am against all the new normal covid nonsense. Not sure why because it doesn't really effect me.</p>

        <p>Same. I was a homebody due to my mental illnesses even BEFORE the CoVid-19 'pandemic' started.</p>
<p>However I got resentful real quick that I was being told "Hey, you have to stay home because of this virus!" and "A mask will protect you!" because I knew the IFR of this virus could not POSSIBLY be above 1% because if it was people would be panicking and leaving cities in droves to go to the middle of nowhere to avoid this illness!</p>
<p>Yes, the damned thing is a vascular virus (known to occasionally cause permanent damage) that is hella chaotic in whom it kills but it never justified all of this masking and lockdown bullcrap.</p>
<p>I'm also exceedingly angry with the government in that they ordered businesses to shut down without the proper compensation to those businesses. That is against the Constitution's right to no seizure without due process of law!</p>

        <p>Interesting book and how I am starting to view a lot of these people.</p>
<p>The burning conviction that we have a holy duty toward others is often a way of attaching our drowning selves to a passing raft. What looks like giving a hand is often a holding on for dear life. Take away our holy duties and you leave our lives puny and meaningless. There is no doubt that in exchanging a self-centered for a selfless life we gain enormously in self-esteem. The vanity of the selfless, even those who practice utmost humility, is boundless.</p>

        <p>I respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>I have unwavering concrete values that define my character and belief system. All of them are being violated in some way by the measures enacted in response to covid. I would not support these actions even if this were a Black Death level event. Some rights are unalienable, the government didn't bestow them on me and they have no right to take them away.</p>
<p>When I speak to the other side, if I manage to get a comprehensible response, the belief system they are acting on has a lot to do with "how they feel about the situation", which is not a value as far as I know. It also has a lot to do with "CARING ABOUT OTHERS" but only if they conform with their standards. If they don't conform, the insults and death wishes start rolling in from our caring and compassionate humanitarians.</p>
<p>Tldr; I view the government response to this as a direct threat to my basic human rights. I view the opposing side as self-righteous hypocritical infants that need to be coddled by Daddy government. I don't feel self important as much I as I feel a desperation to stop the madness.</p>

        <p>Accidentally found this post looking for something else, and it sounds like you're writing about somebody like me. I've socialized three times since March in person, otherwise I've stayed indoors for anything that wasn't getting groceries or going for a walk by myself. It's been hell. But I do it because the thought of getting somebody that I care about sick, because I decided I wanted to eat in a restaurant, makes me feel sick to my stomach. My entire family has been negatively impacted by covid, and the only thing that I can really do is to try to not add to the problem by being a asymptomatic spreader, or worse for me, getting sick and filling a hospital bed needlessly when where I'm living we're already at the limits of what our health system can take.  And this will eventually go away. So I wait.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that I have no ambitions. I actually started a side business, hit all my financial goals for this year and the next, and my guitar playing has gotten better than it ever has. I'm looking forward to when I can gig again. Even though I know it's probably going to be different than it was. And my home workouts have me in the best shape of my life. Not necessarily amazing compared to other people, but compared to where I was a year ago I can look at myself in the mirror, see how far I've come, and that motivates me to keep going. But I am lonely as fuck. Zoom calls are not a good replacement for seeing people in person. Zoom dating is a joke. But because I believe that this will pass, I live with that for now. Who knows how long my will power will hold out, but it's been enough for the time being. </p>
<p>I also found reading your post interesting, because you seem to think so fundamentally different than I do. I can't understand your perspective, and the rational that you expressed, and that others in the comments have written, don't line up with how I perceive things in the least. I simply can't justify doing something if I feel like it's going to make the lives of the people that I care about potentially worse.  I have no interest in trying to control others. I'm too busy focusing on living my life in a way that's congruent with my values to pretend that I can control anybody else. I would be lying if I said that it doesn't upset me knowing people aren't going to the lengths that I perceive myself as going to, but everybody's situation is different and it would be foolish of me to expect everybody to even be capable of living through this in one uniform way. There's a reason why people form groups, people perceive and prioritize things differently based on their personal experiences, you're never going to get everybody to agree to something, and the more you try the more resistance will develop.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that other people aren't using this to try and enforce control, grow their power, etc. The power hungry dream about events like this. But that doesn't change the fact that there's a virus with an exponential infection rate and (up until recently) no vaccine rampaging across the planet, that can be spread asymptomatically. The negative effects of which go beyond whether or not it's directly killed somebody. So I'm doing my best to adapt to the current situation, and come out of this in as best a position as possible, while again preventing myself from endangering those I care about.</p>
<p>I hope this somewhat satisfies your curiosity.</p>
