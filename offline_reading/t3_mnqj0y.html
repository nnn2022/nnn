    <strong>There should have never been any Covid "restrictions" to begin with</strong>
    <p><p>With everything going on still from a Pandemic that started in 2020 and apparently is still going on I have been starting to ask myself more and more questions.</p>
<p>Like this one ... why did we need to have a "mandate" for masking or distancing? If they were that concerned with people's health shouldn't they have just WARNED us about Covid? Now some will say "hold up they are warning us that's the whole point of the restrictions to keep everyone safe!" Why does a healthy kid, teen or even adult have to follow restrictions? They should have just said everything of staying 6 feet, 3 feet, masking up if your nervous should have been "precautions" that you "could take" if you were that worried about it.</p>
<p>Yet instead "precautions" got "mandated". Telling people there is a "mandate" is essentially telling us that you the government don't believe we are capable of doing the right thing on our own. What ever happened to the good old times when there was viruses that we would just be "reminded" to wash our hands, avoid touching our faces, don't get to close to people you don't know, etc. Yet here we are in 2021 where now "reminders" and "helpful precautions" are now "mandated".</p></p>
