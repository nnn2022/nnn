    <strong>IM PISSED IM PISSED IM VERY PISSED</strong>
    <p><p>can’t visit my sibling in the hospital due to covid restrictions. this regime disgusts me and at this point anyone who supports this stuff should be ashamed and are also probably lazy and uninterested in the world. 
I’m walking through a beautiful city BACK from the hospital to my place, and this city is packed with angry mask wearers who stare at me with death eyes because I choose not to partake. I usually don’t do these type of rants but I feel genuinely sick to my stomach that this is happening and in my opinion EVERYONE and I mean everyone who wears a mask outside, has uttered the words “because of covid”, who has encouraged this new normal, has not taken a step back to think about the absolute terror they’ve inflicted on so many because they’re WEAK is culpable and responsible. This year has illuminated many things but the biggest one is this: people are fucking stupid and occasionally downright evil.
Thank you for listening and for the love of god FOREGO your mask outside because (this is to all you <em>doomers</em> present) THERE IS NO FUCKING EVIDENCE THAT OUTDOOR TRANSMISSION IS A THING AND YOU JUST LOOK PATHETIC. 
Alright. Thanks for listening. Godspeed y’all.</p></p>

        <p>True. And they would like others to be cowardly too. So then they look less bad.</p>

        <p>Nailed it buddy.  My sympathies.  It's amazing how stupid and uncaring people can be and how this 'pandemic' has given them the opportunity to hide behind it and make them appear the opposite.</p>

        <p>My husband couldn't go into the hospital with me when I had to have tests run to make sure I wasn't having appendicitis last April. He couldn't go to the hospital with me when I miscarried in September. I had to undergo tests, IVs, blood draws, confusion - all of these alone. I sat in a hospital bed, losing my first pregnancy by myself. The nurse at the admitting area for the ER wasn't compassionate when I went in, she coldly handed me a mask. The first person to offer me a tissue was the receptionist at the maternity assessment unit. I can't tell you how much it wrecked me to go through one of the most isolating events of my life completely alone. My husband hasn't been able to come to any of my OB appointments for our second pregnancy (which is going better than the first). I hear you, you're not the only one over this.</p>

        <p>I’m so incredibly sorry. That is absolutely awful. It should never have come to this. I can’t imagine how scary and isolating that was for you- I’m ashamed of the world on your behalf. Keep your head up.</p>

        <p>I know what it's like to be on the patient side. Thankfully, I was as able to get into some therapy shortly after I miscarried, but yeah, it was definitely traumatic. I still get upset thinking about it sometimes. It should never be like that, pandemic or no. Not trying to add to your own woes, nor take away from them - what you feel is 100% valid and legit. My husband and I can definitely empathize with you and what you're going through, even if it's slightly different. Keep your head up, too. It will hopefully get better soon!</p>

        <p>My stepfather was killed in a hit and run in August of 2019. I'm happy he died then because it would've killed me to have him die alone in a room with no family. How sad is it that I'm glad he is dead.</p>
