    <strong>Like to understand opposition to masks in this sub</strong>
    <p><p>Hey All, I am a very passionate lockdown and new normal skeptic. However, I am pro masks. But I'd like to understand from the people who don't like to wear masks, why they believe so.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is it because you think at a community level, improper usage of masks render them invalid? Because I have seen studies that say wearing a mask cuts down the particles that are emitted by your nose/mouth and into the air by around 65%. (Will dig up the article, for reference). Even then, people wearing a mask the right way, they are protected, right? So I suppose there's nothing wrong in asking people to wear one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it because of the unseen psychological effects of wearing a mask? Like virtue signaling? If yes, do you think we can address them separately?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the opposition one of principle, that, the mandate cannot exist in a free society?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am open to changing my mind. Help me understand what you think :)</p></p>

        <p>Not justified by any science and like many parts of the response considered an ineffective reaction to a pandemic, particularly a category 2 (mild) pandemic like this, until 2020. So what changed? Not the science.</p>
<p>Masks are a gateway. First it was shut down for 2 weeks. We complied. Then it was shut down another 2 weeks and another and another. We complied. Then it was wear masks. We complied. You think they are going to stop there?</p>
<p>The reason why you exhale is to breathe out your own waste product. Masks trap that. This is dangerous. Your body expels waste for a reason. You are not supposed to take it back into your body.</p>
<p>They are a muzzle and a visible signal of your cooperation. Most people who are wearing them know they don't work or don't wear them correctly. But wearing them shows the powers that be that you are obeying.</p>
<p>I would also agree on the point of government overreach. Want to wear masks? Fine. Want to force me to wear masks. Not fine. Not in America. Same with locking up 80 year olds, no matter the risk.  They are old enough to decide for themselves.</p>

        <p>This! Everybody is free to do whatever they believe is good for them, but I would like to make my own choices.
Masks might be useful if you spend a long time in close proximity to people who might be infected. But in 90% of all situations they're useless. The vast majority of infections occur in private settings and for lack of policy enforcement in nursing homes, not on the street or in shops.</p>

        <p>Pretty much what others said.  If it really were that dangerous why haven’t people been dropping like flies in the streets? It’s all about control.</p>
<p>No one has the right to tell me I can’t see my close friends or family.  Think about it.  What gives the government or just people in general the right to say who you can and can’t see? </p>
<p>As for the mask, I don’t like shit covering my face. It’s very uncomfortable especially with my facial hair (and no I won’t shave it). Doctors get by because they are not being active and are in an air conditioned building. </p>
<p>Don’t me the whole “well so and so is a doctor and he ran or biked for 20 miles with a mask on”. He did huh? So why isn’t the mask drenched in sweat?</p>

        <p>1) This disease is not deadly for the vast majority of people on earth. There is no need for forcing mask wearing for a disease that simply poses no threat to most people. The fact that we are still treating this virus as if it's the black death is mind boggling. All the data we have clearly shows this, yet people still feel the need to treat this disease with unnecessary levels of fear and precaution. It defies logic. Masks are an irrational gesture based on fear, not science or data. </p>
<p>2) The science behind the effectiveness of mask wearing is incredibly thin. <a href="https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/masks-dont-work-covid-a-review-of-science-relevant-to-covide-19-social-policy">Here</a> is an article with a bunch of studies that show masks don't work. Now, the point isn't to definitively claim that masks don't work (you can find studies that say a lot of stuff), rather to show that there is too much contradictory evidence out there to justify mandating their use. I take no issue with people wearing them if it makes them feel safe, but to force people to wear them is a terrible precedent. It would be like forcing people to use essential oils. </p>
<p>3) The current mask mandates already in place have not proven to have any real impact on the spread of the disease. Sure, you can cherry pick a few places where you could make the case that "masks worked!", but there are way more places that go against that conclusion.  Places like California, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, etc. all had early mask mandates, yet cases and deaths kept increasing. Same goes for places like Spain, France, Italy, UK, Japan, Belgium, and many many more. When I hear people make the claim that masks have been proven to be effective, it makes me want to scream. Where? Show me? Then I am directed to some theoretical study about masks working, even though we have hundreds of real world examples clearly showing that mask usage has little to no impact on the spread of this disease. </p>
<p>4) Masks were never meant to prevent viral spread. Medical professionals use masks to stop bacterial spread. Masks actually can be helpful in that sense. But viruses spread with our without masks. And masks really are only effective when the right kinds are used (not old bandanas), when they are worn properly, when they are kept clean and not reused over and over, and when they are used in a sterile environment. So trained medical professionals, properly using high quality masks in a clean hospital setting could be effective. But thats not at all what is happening in the real world, and that pretty much renders the theoretical benefits null and void. </p>
<p>5) There is so much inconsistency on how mask laws are written, implemented, enforced and followed, that any potential benefits are impossible to track. This is a problem in that it makes the claims of masks "working" ridiculous. The data we have is nowhere near good enough to make such claims. But more importantly it gives politicians and policy makers a vague dataset that they can use to manipulate. </p>
<p>6) People say that masks aren't that big of a deal and it's an easy sacrifice to make in order to get past the pandemic. But while wearing masks isn't the end of the world, there are plenty of negative side effects that tend to be ignored or glossed over, such as:</p>
<p>a) Masks collect bacteria and spread other disease to the wearer. </p>
<p>b) Masks for extended periods of time limit oxygen flow which is unhealthy.</p>
<p>c) Masks limit visual communication which is extremely detrimental to the hard of hearing, people with learning disabilities, and children.</p>
<p>d) Mask are bad for the skin and cause rashes, acne and irritations.</p>
<p>d) Disposable masks are a waste of resources and bad for the environment. </p>
<p>e) Masks give people a false sense of security and make them take risks that they normally wouldn't take. (I personally do not believe this disease is risky, but many do).</p>
<p>f) If masks work to slow the spread of the disease, then they get in the way of achieving herd immunity, and that delay will cost more lives than slowing the spread will save. So masks will ultimately result in more deaths.</p>
<p>g) Masks send a dangerous message to our children (and pretty much everyone else) that it's ok to make irrational decisions based on bad science and data. It normalizes something that should not be normalized. It validates illogical fears and does so by law. It is pure insanity. It is a dangerous step on the road to tyranny. It took a decade of conditioning for Hitler to be able to fully implement his evil ideas. He didn't just start exterminating jews in 1933. It was a slow process where he conditioned the people to accept smaller levels of evil little by little.</p>

        <p>I think for most of us (me anyway) the real crux of the issue is that we don't believe that COVID is particularly dangerous.  So the effectiveness of the mask doesn't matter.</p>

        <p>The mask mandates, as they stand, are an infringement of civil liberties IMO. If a private business or employer wants to require masks? 100% fine. People have a choice where to do business. Let the free market decide. And before you ask- yes, I’d have said the same for things like indoor smoking at bars, etc etc but that ship has long sailed. The evidence regarding secondhand smoke is also far stronger than the evidence for masks, for example. </p>
<p>There is absolutely zero evidence that masks work on a macro level to alter the curve of this virus. If people feel masks help on a micro/individual level they are free to wear one, free to require masks at their businesses and/or refuse to shop at businesses that meet their expectations. They (individuals, the govt) are NOT free to force me to wear a mask, a red shirt, a blue hat, or frankly anything else. That would be up to the business/property owner.</p>
<p>I would be massively more neutral and less chippy about masks if this had been left to individual businesses. Most would have required masks ANYway due to public pressure. However- they’d also be able to STOP requiring them due to public pressure as numbers improve. I see no evidence that government mask mandates will go away anytime soon- we will be in these masks forever now, and have no say/choice.</p>

        <p>May be difficult to overcome 6 months of being told the “right” thing to do as a citizen, I’ll try anyway to give you some critical tools. </p>
<p>1) Rewind to early March when US Surgeon General and Head of NIH Fauci went on national media to insist that people not wear masks, to conserve supply. At the forefront of a pandemic, if masks were effective, would you not want the populace in them? If they were effective, don’t all the reported deaths in NY/NJ fall squarely on these 2’s conscience?</p>
<p>2) Fauci goes on record recently as saying that asymptomatic individuals are not a driving force in a pandemic.</p>
<p>3) Sweden adopts a common-sense approach, gets lambasted and scorned, and now, 6 months later, has a lower mortality rate per capita than many Euro nations (UK, Belgium, Spain, Italy) despite never having a mask recommendation nor going into any lockdown measure. Soon USA rate will also pass theirs. Those who lambasted Swedish philosophy fall over themselves trying to discount these facts now.</p>
<p>4) Every statistic thrown out as evidence of mask-wearing is either completely fabricated or misrepresented (bacteria vs virus for example) as no reputable study has been conducted. Yet we have been inundated with propaganda such as 1 person wears a mask=70% less likelihood of transmission, both people 95%. Absolutely no source for these claims yet swallowed up as if gospel.</p>
<p>5) In my state, mandatory masking went into effect in early June, along with closure of many businesses. Our highest totals for cases/deaths occurred in July/August.</p>

        <p>Can you provide any compelling evidence that masks are effective for stopping transmission of viruses when worn by the general public in their daily lives? </p>
<p>It doesn’t exist, as far as I know. </p>
<p>I’ve actually recently asked this of some medical professionals I know - all pro-mask, with health issues that make them particularly vulnerable. Waiting on some answers still but to date, the common answer is “no, there’s not evidence that masks worn by the general public stop transmission, but they <em>might</em> work and better safe than sorry.” </p>
<p>“Better safe than sorry” is a fabulous reason for you, personally, to choose to wear a mask. It is no reason at all to mandate that an entire society wear them at all times - that’s the issue. </p>
<p>A government that wants to regulate individual behavior and bodies had damn well better have a SOLID basis for the importance/benefit of doing so. That absolutely does not exist here.</p>

        <p>Also where do most people store their masks when not in use? I’m pretty sure most are not keeping them in a sterile environment.</p>
