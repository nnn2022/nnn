    <strong>Suggestions for best place(s) to visit in Europe in the summer for as normal a time as possible?</strong>
    <p><p>Been trying to plan a summer holiday with my mates for a little while now, problem is everywhere we think of going seems like it will still have ridiculous restrictions still in place.</p>
<p>Any ideas / predictions for where to go that would be as close to summer 2019 as possible, i.e Clubs open, bars open, no masks, large crowds allowed etc. Of course noone knows what things will look like yet, so just trying to get an idea and have something to look forward to other than constant fucking restrictions.</p>
<p>Thinking maybe Belarus? Ukraine? Poland?</p>
<p>Apologies if this is the wrong sub, but I'm sure you can guess what sort of responses this would get in basically any other reddit sub ðŸ˜´</p>
<p>Cheers lads</p></p>

        <p>The east will probably the best choice, don't know how they are doing it now. But central is all locked up.
I believe in Spain bars are open or at least were open a few weeks back.
Don't even think we're going to have festivals either this year.</p>
<p>Only thing i can suggest is to keep an eye on the 'numbers' of cases and see where it goes from there and then look what they are going to do.</p>

        <p>I have a friend in Ukraine and he tells me that once you leave the cities, things are pretty much as they always have been. He lives in Kyiv.</p>
<p>Ukranians are very anti-establishment so even if there are corona rules, you won't have to much trouble breaking them.</p>
