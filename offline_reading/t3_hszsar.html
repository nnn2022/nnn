    <strong>Just another rant about the continued lockdowns in MI</strong>
    <p><p>Hi, I don't think I've posted to this particular sub yet but it makes me happy to see that I'm not completely alone in my thoughts. </p>
<p>I live in Michigan and my <em>lovely</em> govenor is threatening to move back to stage 3 (no stores or restaurants) if cases continue to rise. I find it extremely unfair that even though our "spike" was 4 deaths to 15, a number that would've been celebrated months ago, she is still pushing the panic narrative. People getting the virus and not dying is good! I can't believe that everyone is still so brainwashed to not think critically about this.</p>
<p>I'm relatively younger, and all of my friends tend to lean liberally, which I do as well depending on the issue, but they will not be open to discussion because the majority of younger adult liberals (in my observation) are not open to discussion and set up issues in which they are always right and any other opinion is always wrong. I feel very trapped because I thought my friends were smarter and could think for themselves, but even when I mention anything and provide evidence, they usually just grow quiet and their opinion is not remotely swayed. </p>
<p>I am horrified of this hivemind mindset continuing any longer, and I really did think all of this would be over right now. I am absolutely devastated about my future, and I feel like I can't open up to anyone and that the public opinion will never sway. I've struggled with mental illness since I was around 13, and the thought of the new normal being pushed into 2021, even post-vaccine, or even being pushed back into phase 3 again, is honestly driving me to the brink of suicide. I want to go to concerts again, I want to stand in packed amusement park lines where I don't have to wear a mask and stand 6 feet apart, and I want the world to wake up and for everything to be okay. </p>
<p>I'm normally very closed off when it comes to posting about emotions on the internet, but it is killing me lately. I don't know what to do or what to look forward to anymore and I'm horrified that all of this is still going on, though science is not on the side of lockdowns, or, arguably, masks.</p>
<p>I also don't normally like asking for the validation of strangers on the internet, but I could use a positive opinion about thinks looking up at some point. I hope you all are doing well :)</p></p>

        <p>I wish I could tell you "Hey, yeah, everything's gonna be fine! 2021 is going to be completely normal, everything will be great! You'll see, we may even get back to normal in a month!" but I don't want to lie to you or give you false hope.</p>
<p>At this point, I am not seeing improvement. I'm really not. I wish I could feel the optimism that I see many, <em>many</em> others share in this sub. But I do not. California locked down again. Many events, now into 2021, are being cancelled. I've read government documents that state this could go on into 2021. I am not seeing public opinion change either, the masses still seem panicked and afraid of COVID. I could go on...</p>
<p>I'm really sorry. I wish I had an answer or something wise, and hopeful to say. I just don't. These are uncertain times, and I honestly believe something is going on behind the scenes which are stoking the on-going hysteria, because interested parties seem to want this to continue indefinitely for some reason that we can only speculate on.</p>
<p>All I can say is...just hope that things do get better, that people do "wake up".</p>

        <p>It's all good. I keep reading it too and it's been killing me. I honestly can't believe how people are still buying into any of this, but I, obviously, hope they wake up too. I'm doing my best to try and slightly tip people against the lockdown,  but it's a long process.</p>

        <p>It's killing me too. I have this reputation around here as this "cynical, tough bitch doomer that likes to spread misery to everyone because she gets off on people suffering" but...eh, no. I'm just hardened because this is just yet another in a long line of failures and shitty events that have happened in my life. Though even then, this makes all my other trauma look like a cake walk. I feel like I'm going to have a(nother) mental breakdown any day now.</p>

        <p>Hey, I feel the same way though. My previous worst year of my life (2017) looks like a paradise compared to what it is right now.  I've been having mental breakdowns daily because of all of this, but I guess all that matters is living to even see the next one. I hope you feel better at some point, because things have to be even a little better at some point, even if it's years away.</p>

        <p>It's tough. I just bought my first home in 2019, with plans to get pregnant in 2020. Yeah...not...gonna...happen... I'm in my mid 30s now, and pregnancy becomes harder with age, but at the same time, I refuse to bring children into this crapsack world, so my dreams are dashed. I was also losing weight, making friends, and...now I'm gaining weight, friendships are flimsy right now (and no, not due to lockdown specifically)... Meh. My life is wrecked, and I don't know if it will get better. I survived all the crap that I did, and it feels like it was for nothing. I honestly believe that if there's a God out there, he is laughing at me for every misfortune I go through.</p>

        <p>God, I'm so sorry. I really do hope things turn around so you can have kids and feel like the world is kind enough for them to live in. I feel very similarly though. I'm younger and don't want kids, at least right now, but this really has been the nail in the coffin for me. It's a tough place to live in</p>

        <p>I recently did some traveling and every state is not the same.   Since you are young, perhaps you should try to get out of Michigan?   One of the most reasonable states in the country is your next door neighbor, Indiana.</p>

        <p>Hi fellow Michigander! Our Governor is a real piece of work, that's for sure. What helps me is not paying any attention to her or her diktats. I pretend that she doesn't exist and don't obey her in the slightest. </p>
<p>This whole thing is a nightmare, but I am hopeful that more people are calling bullshit. The other night I went to a get together with my big extended family, and every single one of my aunts, uncles and cousins was on the A-team. They are all very normal, very respectable people so it was such a relief to hear them rant about how stupid and nonsensical this covid bs is. Everyone was really quiet at first, but as the wine started flowing, the conversation got more and more animated. Someone would say "the testing is a fraud" then it was "they're up to something with the coin shortage" "children are more likely to die from lightning-strike" and on and on.</p>
<p>One of my aunts is "at-risk" and she was up in arms about how harmful "social distancing" is. Anyway, I think the more we get together, have a few drinks and talk about what's happening, we can kill this thing socially speaking. </p>
<p>Hang in there and look into <a href="https://www.michiganunitedforliberty.com/">https://www.michiganunitedforliberty.com/</a></p>

        <p>Hello fellow Michigander!  I feel your pain. I’ve been staying sane by getting out hiking in our state parks (while the witch will let them stay open), going out to the lake, and enjoying being outside where I don’t have to wear a face diaper to show that I’m a good compliant citizen. Getting down to Indiana where folks are still halfway sane helps too. Feel free to send a message if you’d like to have someone to talk to who isn’t part of the hive.</p>
