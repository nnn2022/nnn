        <p>When covid first happened I believed it was legit, eventually I awakened to the truth. The numbers just didn't add up. Also the media kept saying the hospitals were full, yet I saw with my own eyes they were not. I also saw videos of them working on legit dummy's claiming they were sick covid patients. </p>
<p>In the end the evidence against this plandemic was too great to ignore.</p>

        <p>Honestly besides personal observations, it was learning about the great reset agenda, before that, I might have been skeptical, but I could not see any reason why would they fake a pandemic, what could be possibly gained from that. Now it all makes sense</p>

        <p>George Gammon, he has a financial channel on youtube I follow, he never talked about conspiracy theories or said anything crazy before, when I saw him talking about this, I thought, maybe this is real, so I watched his video with an open mind.</p>

        <p>I have been here for a while. I am not a crazy covid-denier, nor am I an avid anti-masker. However I am a lockdown skeptic, and no one in my circle has any critical thinking skills. I just cannot get over the way that MSM reports on all of this. </p>
<p>I actually had an “AHA!” Moment back in like May or June as I was watching the news. I just realized “holy shit, they are gaslighting us!”</p>
<p>Honestly, if the press had been a little more transparent and rational, then I would be much more apt to listen to their “facts”. But the hate, anger and division that has trickled down from the government, through the media, social media, and finally into our communities has gotten so out of hand, that it’s going to take generations to heal our collective human psyche.</p>

        <p>I never really was on the fence, but when this started, I was, albeit a tiny bit, worried because you'd see how China was and how the streets were empty, and the news pretty much made it seem like ebola, like no matter who got it, young or old, healthy or unhealthy, would have a high chance of death. But I never was that worried over it, only a tiny bit. But I caught on to this BS pretty early on.</p>
<p>Then it came to the US and my <em>lovely</em> governor decided to shut down the entire state, and he was a bit proud for being one of the first ones to do it, too. Then I realized that this is BS, because we had only a few cases in the entire state, and he wanted to close it for that? I also heard that people were being yelled at for going to the beach. I remember still thinking the virus might be serious, but not like I originally thought. I remember thinking, yeah, okay, maybe this virus might be bad, but that doesn't give you an excuse to take away our rights to go where we want. I also remember for a short period of time (at least in my state) it was kind of switched politically. The Republicans on the news were talking about the "selfish people going out living their lives when there's a pandemic" basically what the Democrats say now. That was very early into this. I'm Republican and I hated my party for this, until it switched to how it is now. </p>
<p>Then around April, face diapers started being a thing, and I just laughed at those paranoid people. But then, they were even trying to force it on you and that's what made me the angriest. You do NOT get to tell people that they now have a dress code just to go to the store or they "can't go there." They might as well say "If you don't wear exactly what we tell you to, we don't care if you starve to death." And they have the nerve to say "If you don't like it, don't shop here!" Well yeah, I wouldn't if there was another place less stupid, but they're all enforcing this idiotic dress code. Words can not describe how angry this makes me, more than anything else in my life. And what's worse is that we, as people, let them do this to us. </p>
<p>Face diapers were crazy when they started and still crazy now. I haven't let the fact that most people go along with it change that for me. It was insanity when it started and even more insane now. It's not normal and it never will be. And now I realize that it's basically the flu for a lot of people. Even if it was bad though, that doesn't give the government or anyone else the right to tell me that if I wish to be a member of society, I need to cater to their fears. It worries me what they would do if there actually was a real public health threat. I still would never agree to "mandates" no matter how bad it got, but I ask myself, if they go this crazy over a flu-like virus, what if there's an ebola outbreak? It scares me to think what they'd try. But no matter what, you don't get to tell people what to do, ever. No emergency changes that. </p>
<p>Sorry, this probably isn't the exact response you're looking for since I was at most a bit worried, but that soon went away. And I'm not an ex-masker because I never was one and never will be one. I know I wasn't "on the fence" about it, but I thought I'd share my experience too.</p>

        <p>Your experience sounds a lot like mine. It was never really a switch from one side of the fence or another, just a magnification of my thoughts, opinions, and feelings all along.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the pandemic I was a big time doomer. I used to harass my dad for going out and doing stuff because he’s diabetic and watching the news told me that was a death sentence. As summer rolled around I was prepared for the waves of people who would die, or the hospitals getting over run, and none of it ever came. I watched many people I know who were perfectly healthy get tested and all come back positive. Then I started engaging in communities like this and talking to people in real life instead of being glued to the news cycle. Now I live my life normally. I visit my loved ones, hang out with my buddies, go out to eat and shop without a mask, smile at people, shake hands, hug my friends and enjoy my time on earth. I feel bad for the people still caught in the cycle of misery but I’m not one of them.</p>
