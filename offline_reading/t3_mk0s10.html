        <p>No thats not their logic. Hes saying that wearing a mask takes no effort and doesnt effect him at all bit wearing it has the chance to save a life so why not wear it. If simply wearing a peice of paper on my face has the slightest chance of saving someones fucking life why wouldnt I do it? If your too stupid to see the difference, locking myself in my house with no resources is more way difficult than wearing a peice of cloth or paper on your face.</p>

        <p>It’s always funny when people make arguments like this they feel the need to include things such as “if you’re too stupid” rather then provide evidence that masks do anything. You should try approaching it a little differently maybe you could change someone’s mind or have an adult convo. I hope you have a great day, I’ll continue breathing fresh air after this convo.</p>

        <p>The argument wasn't if masks work or not. And it doesnt matter how I explain it to you I cant change anyone's mind here, I could get the fucking magic school bus and shrink you down to show you exactly how they help and I wont change anyone's mind.

        <p>The logic is very simple, if you took every little tiny thing that may help keep someone else safer in one way or another you eventually get to the scenario I described. Masks may or may not provide .00001% safety. Gas masks may provide .00001% safety should we all wear gas masks? Not driving may cause people to be .0001% safer so why not bike everywhere? Would that inconvenience you because it’s much quicker to drive but we’ll be safe right? </p>
<p>How about we all learn about personal responsibility? If you feel it’s not safe to go outside because someone may not be wearing a mask, that may or may not make people 0.00001% safer, then YOU stay home. Oh and just a news flash, you or anyone wearing a mask, hasn’t saved and won’t save a life, good for you if it makes you feel virtuous though. </p>
<p>Both of your posts are angry rambling of nonsense. It just makes people not even want to listen to you when you just screech “reeee wear a mask reee”. If you’re going to waste oxygen you mineaswell speak like an adult and try to help people understand your viewpoint instead.</p>

<p>the point is masks <strong><em>dont inconvenience you</em></strong> and have a chance to save a life so why not wear one.</p>
<p>I dont want to get into whether they work or not, I'm just going to leave it at they help some amount, it might be a lot maybe a little doesnt matter, I'm not responding if you say they dont.</p>

        <p>I beg to differ, look up the effects of masks related to onset skin disorders like rosacea. This is one example of the negative effects of masks.</p>
<p>You, like everyone else, lump everyone into the same boat. There’s millions of people with millions of different situations. It’s a massive inconvenience for many people. </p>
<p>But that is separate, the root issue is, if you are scared that there’s a 0.000001% chance someone may die because you aren’t wearing a mask you need to stay inside, actually you are better suited for the psych ward. Stop telling other people there’s criteria for living their lives. Wake up brother.</p>

Btw try not to sound so condesending, it just makes you sound like your pretending to know what your talking about.
Im not scared someone will die if i dont wear it, im happy to possibly save someone if i do. "You are better suited for the psych ward" It’s always funny when people make arguments like this they feel the need to include things such as “if you’re too stupid".
If you look back i never said you should wear a mask, I'm just explaining soemeone elses point and saying why I wear a mask. I did wake up, got out of bed 2 hours ago ;)</p>

        <p>The study on rosacea was done because of the effects nurses were experiencing. So wrong again. Also there’s a difference between going to the grocery store and breathing or hovering over a cut open body while doing surgery. </p>
<p>It’s fine if you’d like to project I hope you understand that the masks at this point are about control. It’s why the experts like dr fauci can’t keep it straight on whether people should or shouldn’t. Wishing you the best, get some fresh air.</p>

        <p>So your saying because doctors wear masks over a cut open body, the masks are safe for them but not us. Ive work a mask 7 hours a day for the past year and nothing has happened to me, so it doesnt inconvience me so why wouldnt i wear it.
How the fuck am i projecting, also again with the condesending. Tell me, how are they about control? Assuming your saying get fresh air cause i wear a mask, air passibg through or around a mask doesnt make it any less "fresh", but now im just nitpicking.</p>

        <p>So do you sterilize everything you own with medical grade equipment prior to interacting with an inanimate object when you come into contact with another human? Because that’s what doctors do during surgery. The mask is so they aren’t breathing into an open wound. I dont know how else to explain that.</p>
<p>Deflecting the convo with “you’re condescending” is weak. You have no idea if I’m condescending through text. </p>
<p>You seem like a very angry individual. Take the mask off get some fresh air take some big deep breathes and let that oxygen flow to your brain! :)</p>

        <p>What does sterilizing every object have to do with the saftey of a mask? Yeah they stop you from breathing into a wound, in fact thats why it helps stop spreading the virus, your breath hits the mask and doesnt spread out as much lowering the chances of someone else getting it.
Im not "deflecting the convo". Somehow you still act condesending while saying your not condesending, yeah you can tell through text lol

        <p>Yeah thats why I havent been trying to convince you lol.</p>
<p>But about that link, theu did 2 groups, 1 was <strong><em>suggested</em></strong> to wear masks and the other wasent told anything, so both groups could have worn masks, and you people seem to be kinda rare so you can assume most did wear masks, plus other factors could have contributed like they were suggested to social distance, we dont know how many of each group did social distance, we dont know how many of the control wore masks. If im missing somethink let me know :P</p>

        <p>I did read it, if you look under limitations it says that it does not say whether masks work, the test only shows how effective <strong><em>suggesting masks</em></strong> is because the group was not told they must wear a mask, they were told they should while the other group was not told to not wear masks, both groups wore masks. Yes its based on science but your proving the wrong thing, you just proved suggesting people to wear a mask doesnt work.</p>
<p>Also the fuck you on about "react emotionally"</p>
<p>You started off good then went back to being condescending,</p>

        <p>Any scientific study is going to include limiting factors that’s why science varies in interpretation and validity. If you read you can see exactly how many did not adhere to the recommendation in the group and regardless the study found an insignificant change in contracting the virus. </p>
<p>I’m bored, feel free to read the whole study though it’s one of many that aren’t YouTube series showing smoke doesn’t go through a mask lmao. hope you have a great day and get some fresh air. :)</p>

        <p>actually yeah thats a good point I dont wanna go below karma requirements. But also every time I see this sub its hard to not say anything, these people are just sitting in this echo chamber fueling each others horrible beliefs about how a mask is worse than this huge virus. I know I cant and will probably never change anyone's minds, they are way too stubborn, but I still cant say nothing :/</p>

<p>And then if you tell them they could shop locally made or used they would say it’s too hard or expensive.</p>
