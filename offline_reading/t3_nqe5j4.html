        <p>I'm certain this would get me called and insensitive horrible person but grief is something so all-consuming that it really renders you unable to think rationally or clearly for quite some time. Most people who are grieving very intensely can really only see the world in relation to them and their pain and their loss. When you're going through something like that it's very difficult to see outside yourself and accept that there are people out in the world who are happy and loving life or who are living very differently from you and want different things. Everyone is mean and selfish and horrible for not realizing how much you are suffering. I say this as someone who has been through it and come out the other side. I know someone right now who lost a relative who was a mother figure to her from covid. She is downright hostile and angry at anyone who isn't terrified and wearing a mask and vaccinated. Because of her loss and pain she's unable to see outside of that bubble. Because of this I think people that have suffered a loss due to the situation need to realize that they are not seeing things from an objective standpoint. Their entire Viewpoint is muddied through the lens of grief. The intensity of their feelings over Shadow facts.</p>

        <p>This is all true. That said, our culture of excessively doting upon those who have lost loved ones to covid vs other illnesses this last year is part of this phenomenon as well.</p>
<p>Grieving covid deaths is a trend right now, and many are eager to hop on it for clout.</p>

        <p>It really is true though. Not even just pertaining to COVID, it's humorous, really, how little people think about how dangerous the very act of getting into a car, and getting on the road with it is. Statistically speaking, it's WAY more dangerous than most things people are terrified of in life, including now COVID. Yet, they do it everyday without thinking about it, because they can't live in fear of that, and it's just a part of life. Yet, they don't apply that logic (and logic is exactly what it is) to sickness, and COVID. Very myopic, and shortsighted of all the doomers, but that's exactly what their minds have been engineered to be by the programming and propaganda that's been pumped into them by the media, and the narrative.</p>
