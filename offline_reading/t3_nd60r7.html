    <strong>Our culture’s pathetic, superficial, low-effort “compassion”</strong>
    <p><p>It’s been said many times but it still holds true - for so many people, the masks are nothing more than a way to display virtue. As the pandemic ends, unfortunately many of our beloved fellow countrymen will continue to cover their face for lack of a better way to tell the rest of us “Hey, I care. I’m a good person.”</p>
<p>Wearing is not caring folks. Shouting people down for not wearing, I hope you realize, is <em>especially</em> not caring. I know sometimes it can be difficult to discern virtue from malice/neurosis. So I though it might be a good thought exercise to go through a few examples of actual compassion versus the opposite. Here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ Asking your elderly neighbor if you can get them some items from the grocery store</li>
<li>
<p>❌ Shouting someone down for not wearing a mask in a grocery store</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ Supporting local businesses </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❌ Advocating that the government shut down your neighbor’s local business (which took years to build) because you’re afraid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ Reaching out to comfort someone who lost a relative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❌ Baselessly blaming internet strangers for the loss of your relative </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ Checking in on your lonely, isolated nextdoor neighbor to see if they’re okay</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❌ Calling the police on your neighbor because they have several cars parked in the driveway </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ Making sure kids can still go to school, and explaining that they don’t have to be afraid </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>❌ Depriving kids of education, telling them it’s dangerous to socialize, and forcing them to wear masks outside</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ Donating money to a good cause such as a food pantry, meals on wheels, or homeless shelter to make sure people are taken care of during the economic downturn</p>
</li>
<li>❌ Donating absolutely nothing and instead advocating the government take the money from other people, then use it to pass spending packages that mostly feed special interests</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helps! Next time someone gets on their high horse about mask wearing, ask them how many of the above green actions they’ve taken during the last to year. I’ll bet it’s not very many</p></p>

        <p>They think they care, but when they see someone not wearing a mask they often wish death upon them... all this is doing is exposing shitty people for who they really are.</p>

        <p>The part about blaming strangers for the loss of a relative is particularly relatable.  Someone I work with lost his grandmother to covid and while I obviously have sympathy, the fact that he was aggressively pro-lockdown following this made me lose any empathy I could have had.
I’m sorry, but it is not rational to want to subjugate society because you lost a family member.</p>

        <p>And threatening to hit someone who pleads to a bus driver- with clear emotional distress in her voice-  that she can't wear a mask (past abuse trauma) isn't caring, either. 
It's bullying.</p>
