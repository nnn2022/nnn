        <p>Like... why would he even have a mask if he was going to yell at the first person who told him to wear it? She forgot the most important part of the story; when everyone in the waiting room clapped. Who wastes their time writing crap like this?</p>

        <p>My mind automatically could not take her seriously when I saw “Anywayz”, it wouldn’t matter what she was writing about. People need to stop with this mindset that they’re heroes over calling people out over masks.</p>
<p>I’m surprised she wasn’t called out about referencing race so often as if it were really relevant.</p>

        <p>Covid gaslighting.  That's all I can say.</p>
<p>In all honesty I realize now the increased insanity on facebook before the 2016 presidential election was just a test of their ability to teach everyday people how to gaslight each other.  I vote independent normally so I was completely baffled by how people who I used to go to church with were suddenly turning on each other and proclaiming to their entire friends list how great they were for calling this person out for whatever and so on.  </p>
<p>I finally just ditched FB because 6 months after the election people were still going strong.  I now see the same behaviors being unleashed with this insanity.</p>
<p>I had an big "OHHHH" moment a few weeks ago when I realized what they did.  The media is teaching these people how to justify their verbal and physical abuse of others while telling them how virtuous they are.</p>
<p>I think what baffles me is how their virtue signaling is cloaked in controlling behaviors.  If someone were to behave the same way in a romantic relationship and others witnessed it they would call that person out for being controlling and abusive.  </p>
<p>When I left FB I left a "goodbye" post and without calling anyone out said I was disappointed that people I had known were turning against their own family members and friends and becoming verbally abusive to justify their positions.  This lady I worked with who was honestly one of the worst instigators started arguing with me in the comments and then proceeded to claim I was gaslighting her when I pointed out her daily posts to her entire friends list yelling and calling her family members names were verbally abusive from my point of view.  It was a truly bizarre interaction and I blocked her.  Long comment but hell this all reminds me so much of her.</p>
