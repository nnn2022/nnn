    <strong>A Letter to the Human Rights Commissions of Australia &amp; Victoria</strong>
    <p><p>I just sent the below letter to both the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Victoria Equal Opportunity &amp; Human Rights Commission. As we all know many countries have been in violation of universal human rights, with next to nothing being done about it.</p>
<p>Victoria was today found in breach of human rights when they locked down the public housing towers. The result? They want an apology. Well I say nuts to that. Everyone concerned about human rights should write in to the human rights commissions and demand action be taken. Governments need to be held account for this.</p>
<p>"The Australian federal and state governments have been breaching the human rights of our citizens since March with lockdowns and made-up-on-the-spot government orders that violate the universal rights of human beings. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said it best in a press conference when he commented 'it's not about human rights, it's about human life'. No, Mr Andrews, everything is about human rights. Human rights do not just disappear because a contagious disease is around. Furthermore, both the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Victorian Equal Opportunity &amp; Human Rights Commission have been completely silent on all issues surrounding human rights violations of lockdowns despite Australian citizens clearly suffering. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/</a> - Australia has been in breach of the following:</p>
<p>Article 3.</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person.</p>
<p>Australian citizens right to liberty was disregarded when we were forced under house arrest, forced to close our privately-owned businesses, were banned from travelling and banned from seeing our own family members.</p>
<p>Article 5.</p>
<p>No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>
<p>Australians were subjected to cruel treatment including:</p>
<p>- People being locked inside their apartment complexes unable to leave and at times not given adequate food (recently being found to have breached human rights - <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-17/lockdown-public-housing-towers-breached-human-rights-ombudsman/12991162">http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-12-17/lockdown-public-housing-towers-breached-human-rights-ombudsman/12991162</a> - why did the AHRC not say anything before?)</p>
<p>- Being arrested, assaulted and pulled out of shattered car windows for such things as not wearing masks or refusing to give their address.</p>
<p>Article 9.</p>
<p>No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.</p>
<p>Australians have been subject to arbitrary arrest for breaching 'chief health officer' orders and for practising their right to protest, neither which the police are allowed to do under human rights law.</p>
<p>Article 13.</p>
<p>(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.</p>
<p>(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.</p>
<p>Australia has blocked its own citizens from leaving the country, which is a clear breach of human rights. Many Australian states also blocked citizens from 'nonessential travel' which is also a breach of human rights, with Victoria's 'Ring of Steel' being a major example. Victoria also blocked citizens from leaving their homes after a certain time, with no health reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>Article 16.</p>
<p>(1) Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.</p>
<p>(2) Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.</p>
<p>(3) The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.</p>
<p>Victoria banned weddings in its Stage 4 Lockdowns, a clear breach of Article 17.</p>
<p>Article 18.</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.</p>
<p>Victoria banned Church services in its Stage 4 lockdown.</p>
<p>Article 19.</p>
<p>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</p>
<p>Victorian police arrested a woman for a facebook post - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/03/victoria-police-arrested-pregnant-woman-facebook-post-zoe-buhler-australia-warn-lockdown-protesters">https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/03/victoria-police-arrested-pregnant-woman-facebook-post-zoe-buhler-australia-warn-lockdown-protesters</a></p>
<p>Article 20.</p>
<p>(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.</p>
<p>(2) No one may be compelled to belong to an association.</p>
<p>Lockdowns violated the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, including among families.</p>
<p>Article 23.</p>
<p>(1) Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.</p>
<p>(2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.</p>
<p>(3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.</p>
<p>(4) Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.</p>
<p>When the government ordered private businesses closed it violated the right to work of many Australian citizens.</p>
<p>Article 27.</p>
<p>(1) Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.</p>
<p>(2) Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.</p>
<p>Australian citizens were blocked of the right to participate in culture, with theatres, museums, restaurants, concerts etc all closed down or banned.</p>
<p>The only time we cannot practice our universal rights is whe doing so would result in the breach of someone else's rights. The only article that doing any of this could claim to have breached is the below:</p>
<p>Article 25.</p>
<p>(1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.</p>
<p>(2) Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance. All children, whether born in or out of wedlock, shall enjoy the same social protection.</p>
<p>But never outside of the very first few weeks of the pandemic has our right to medical care ever thought to have been close to being breached. We have never got close to the hospital system being overwhelmed and so any and all lockdowns to prevent such from happening were not justified. In fact they breached another part of article 25 - that of the right to security. People who were forced to close their businesses were forced to do so in breach of the right to security, as those who lost their jobs and livelihoods have lost their security, jobkeeper payments or not. This will have ramifications down the track when there are far less jobs on the market compared to before the lockdowns. Governments also breached this article when their bans on movement blocked people from receiving medical care - which will lead to many undiagnosed illnesses that should have been treated earlier and many missed treatments which will lead to preventable deaths.</p>
<p>These rights are universal. They aren't 'universal except when there's a pandemic'. We as human beings are born with these rights and it doesn't matter what any form of government says about them, even when they claim violating these rights will save lives. They are inherent to all human beings and any breach of them is a breach of our universal human rights.</p>
<p>Action must be taken on the Australian federal and state governments for these breaches and the Australian Human Rights Commission needs to stand up and speak out for all the Australian citizens that were subject to these human rights breaches. Isn't that your job?"</p></p>
