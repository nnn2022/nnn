    <strong>Are you all actually against masks?</strong>
    <p><p>Like I’m being serious here, there’s multiple sources of evidence that support it, detailed here:</p>
<p>https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/masking-science-sars-cov2.html</p>
<p>https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-07-08-oxford-covid-19-study-face-masks-and-coverings-work-act-now#</p>
<p>https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/how-face-masks-can-help-prevent-the-spread-of-covid-19-67646/amp</p>
<p>https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/face-masks-coverings-coronavirus-do-they-work-shops-transport-a9617666.html%3famp</p>
<p>https://msphere.asm.org/content/5/5/e00637-20</p>
<p>Yet you are still against it,</p>
<p>Whilst they don’t completely stop the virus from transmitting, they help,</p>
<p>Think of them like a seatbelt, you wear it, and you are safer, but if you get in a car crash you are still probably going to get hurt, but it would be much worse if you didn’t wear that seatbelt?</p>
<p>Are you against seatbelts because they restrict the space you have to move around in a car? No</p>
<p>Wear a mask, help save lives</p></p>

However, cloth face coverings are not personal protective equipment (PPE) and should not be used instead of a respirator or a facemask to protect a healthcare worker.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-11-20/face-masks-didnt-stop-coronavirus-spread-in-danish-clinical-trial?_amp=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Overall, 95 of the 4,862 volunteers who made it to the end of the study became infected with SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That’s an infection rate of just under 2%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses">Seven studies took place in the community, and two studies in healthcare workers. Compared with wearing no mask, wearing a mask may make little to no difference in how many people caught a flu-like illness (9 studies; 3507 people); and probably makes no difference in how many people have flu confirmed by a laboratory test (6 studies; 3005 people). Unwanted effects were rarely reported, but included discomfort.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article">Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7323223/">Indeed, experiments have shown that surgical and cotton masks do not trap the SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19) virus, which can be detected on the outer surface of the masks for up to 7 days. 7 , 8 Thus, a pre‐symptomatic or mildly infected person wearing a facemask for hours without changing it and without washing hands every time they touched the mask could paradoxically increase the risk of infecting others</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/farce-mask-its-safe-for-only-20-minutes-20030427-gdgnyo.html">"Those masks are only effective so long as they are dry," said Professor Yvonne Cossart of the Department of Infectious Diseases at the University of Sydney. "As soon as they become saturated with the moisture in your breath they stop doing their job and pass on the droplets." Professor Cossart said that could take as little as 15 or 20 minutes, after which the mask would need to be changed. But those warnings haven't stopped people snapping up the masks, with retailers reporting they are having trouble keeping up with demand.</a></p>

<p>Here is where the CDC states "DO NOT use facemasks."</p>
<p>http://archive.today/RKdWc 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/84900</p>
<p>And here is research from the CDC.</p>
<p>"Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids. There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza."
https://archive.is/y22jF</p>
<p>"More research on cloth masks is needed to inform their use as an alternative to surgical masks/respirators in the event of shortage or high-demand situations. To our knowledge, only 1 randomized controlled trial has been conducted to examine the efficacy of cloth masks in healthcare settings, and the results do not favor use of cloth masks."

<p>WHO does not recommend masks
"There is no specific evidence to suggest that the wearing of masks by the mass population has any potential benefit. In fact, there's some evidence to suggest the opposite in the misuse of wearing a mask properly or fitting it properly," Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergencies program, said at a media briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, on Monday.

<p>Mask and infection trends across Europe, etc.
http://archive.today/4SGYt</p>
<p>New England Journal of Medicine, 2nd paragraph 
"We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic."</p>
<p>http://archive.is/CfQBO</p>
<p>BMJ
The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.

<p>England Health Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries evidence on face coverings "not strong in either direction"

http://archive.today/rib2o</p>
<p>University of Minnesota CIDRAP
"We do not recommend requiring the general public who do not have symptoms of COVID-19-like illness to routinely wear cloth or surgical masks because:
There is no scientific evidence they are effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
Their use may result in those wearing the masks to relax other distancing efforts because they have a sense of protection
We need to preserve the supply of surgical masks for at-risk healthcare workers.
Sweeping mask recommendations—as many have proposed—will not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as evidenced by the widespread practice of wearing such masks in Hubei province, China, before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year. Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE."

We shut everything down and have rushed an experimental vaccine for 0.035%. This is bullshit and you are a monster for promoting it.

<p>Also you guys are getting really fucking boring with the seatbelt analogy. Wearing a seatbelt doesn’t cover my nose and mouth and affect my ability to breathe. It’s a whole different situation and not comparable. Seatbelts are not uncomfortable. Masks are.</p>

        <p>I would be inclined to agree with you, however for the most part, masks are there to prevent you from spreading it to other people, not so much yourself, it does reduce the chances of you catching it, but more than anything it stops you from transmitting it</p>

        <p>Aside from the fact that a host of studies disagree with you on this, if the only point is to protect others, and I'm not infected, I don't need to wear a mask.  It CAN'T do anything if I'm not sick or contagious.  Since we have tests for this (which work, or we wouldn't perform them, right? no, not pcr, we know that can't distinguish sick vs well patients, i mean the temp and symptom screening) we can drop masks altogether for the healthy population, and only have those who are sick, with covid, wearing them.</p>

        <p>Fortunately we have real, mechanistic studies that show seatbelts help.  Honestly, if they do nothing but keep you inside the car in a serious wreck instead of ending up outside it, they've made a difference. (Anecdotally, yikes, seriously, you want to stay inside your cage when you hit something.  You can still crack (literally) your skull on a window/post inside, but it's almost always better off than getting chucked in to the street or a tree at high speed.)  That said, if someone doesn't want to wear one, it's no skin off my back.</p>

        <p>You may wanna look at some articles that are pre 2020. I've noticed doing my own meta analysis of the available literature that the efficacy of even n95 masks in a clinical setting to prevent spread of infection from actual infected individuals is highly contested.   </p>
<p>But we aren't talking about n95s and respirators, we're talking about cloth masks. And we aren't talking about symptomatic individuals, we're talking about masking an entire population of mostly healthy people. If the literature doesn't support the efficacy of n95 masks and respirators, how can we possibly think a cloth mask will provide protection?   </p>
<p>Moreover, actual studies (pre2020) that looked at cloth masks showed 0 efficacy and some even showed that wearing a cloth mask makes you more likely to get a respiratory infection.   </p>
<p>Let's contrast the government response at 9/11 to dangerous air at ground 0. The government knew the air was harmful, edited press releases to reduce the perceived danger; told people NOT to wear masks, and to go about their business. Then thousands get cancer from breathing in the toxic air at ground 0.   </p>
<p>So we have at ground 0 actual clear and present danger; government advises you not to protect yourself. Then we have COVID, which even according to "accepted" sources is virtually non-lethal if you're under 80, and mandatory masks across entire nations. Makes sense.</p>
