    <strong>Actually felt human again this past Saturday</strong>
    <p><p>Decided to check out a craft brewery with my family, and it turned out to be a wonderful afternoon. This particular place allowed patrons to bring food in, so there were a lot of people celebrating in a big outdoor area. The weather was great and NO ONE outside was wearing the control mechanism. (To get your beer, depending on who you happened to walk by inside, they asked you to put one on, but seemed for the most part not to really care). A group sitting close to us set out a huge spread of finger foods, and on our way back to our spot they said, "Help yourself." We said, "How nice, but thank you." The one lady said, "No, really, please help yourself. We have so much here. Invite your son over too." I could not believe it. I was so delighted, especially in this shitty time we're living in that we were actually welcomed at their table. We truly felt human again. Good company, good food and good drinks. It was a beautiful day for a change, human beings treating each other with kindness.</p></p>

        <p>That's so wonderful! On Friday I met a friend for dinner at a packed Mexican restaurant. There were at least 3 birthday celebrations where the servers would sing to the table and everyone would clap and cheer. I realized I hadn't heard the happy birthday song in months.</p>
<p>Yesterday I played a gig, and spent the rest of the afternoon listening to live music with no masks in sight. Then I went to a friend's house for a bonfire.</p>
<p>Something I'll never take for granted again is just how IMPORTANT being around other people is. Even if you're an introvert like I am, just being able to enjoy an event or a meal with others, even just one other person, is priceless. Hearing the laughter and chatter of strangers is something I never knew I'd miss. There is no way a Zoom call or Netflix binge will ever replace real human interaction. And being around others without having to worry about judgment was also such a mental relief.</p>

        <p>Humans are humans. We have broke bread together with strangers for millennia. If that practice didn’t cease with the Black Plague, it won’t cease now. I think it’s interesting that because the media screeches so loudly, you’d really think that everyone has collectively decided to do away with food sharing and potlucks and what not but it’s just not true. We are hard wired to seek that out. We are hard wired to just live and share and acquire viruses and play chicken with death for the most part. That’s what we do. And more and more people are falling back into that pattern after having it forcefully disrupted.</p>

        <p>Personal experience - bars are much more welcoming than other businesses these days. No one's there for their health in the first place, no one minus the bartenders and wait staff have to be there, (tip your bartender y'all). And basically every one came their to socialize. so the atmosphere is much more relaxed, with friendliness and intermingling. </p>
<p>Feels like a different planet than a grocery store or sandwich shop.</p>

        <p>That's fair. There's a couple near me like that but I've still found my a welcoming place. Minus the virtue signaling fee of wearing a mask for 30 seconds walking in we're completely normal. High fiving strangers for touchdowns and all (poor wait staff has to wear masks. But even they take them off as needed)</p>
<p>It was a dive of a sportsbar with crappy food no one carries out. But every Sunday at kick off it turns into a magical place. It wasn't the first bar i tried since opening and I'm glad i tried a couple more and found this place.</p>
<p>Might not be possible if you live in new York but i think most areas have a few places like that if you look.</p>

        <p>I had a similar experience, albeit outdoors. Took my family to a couple of "Pumpkin Patch" type local events... The first one half the people were masked up (wealthy demographic, people who care about their image, etc)...the second one was a little bit more "country" and almost no one wore a mask despite several hundred people being present. I had truly forgotten what it was like to be around crowds and to wait in line like before. Also, kids running around having a blast... Some even barefoot (tons of giant inflatables, so some kids didn't bother with shoes between them).</p>
<p>It was, innocent, in all the right ways :-)</p>

        <p>I have two jobs. One is a restaurant. None of the employees care save one or two of them. The owner requires them so she doesn’t get shut down but she hardly wears one either. Some of the Guests care ( lots of New Yorkers especially this time of year). None of the cooks or kitchen staff wear them. People come in have fun and at the end of the night when we are all doing side work no one wears them and I honestly forget it’s a thing till someone mentions a story that mentions “pre covid”.</p>
<p>My other job is at a doctors office. (Chiropractic office so not truly ill patients) Everyone but the doctor thinks everyone is dead or dying and freak panic if you don’t wear one. They don’t even let patients use the bathroom like come on.</p>

        <p>There are a lot of people going back to normal despite what image Reddit may put in your head. Reddit will downvote you into oblivion if you even suggest returning to any sense of normalcy, but Reddit is known for being heavily populated by nerdy homebody types anyway.</p>

        <p>Was actually planning on going to go up to our local apple orchard area Oak Glen this week (CA). The main site "mysteriously" burned down early Friday. The family had been public enemy #1 not even around here but to the leftist Orange and LA county nazis that come over and had been making it their crusade to denounce this family. Then don't come not being an option when there's someone that needs to be silenced. As per usual for that crowd. He and the family are Christian, Trump supporters and the dad has unpopular "racist" opinions online like most of us around here do.</p>
<p>All they've said so far is that the fire stater on the exterior of the buildings. You do the math.</p>
