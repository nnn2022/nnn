        <p>I think this is the deep's state biggest blunder yet... They revealed their cards too quickly, they should of pulled back on the great reset agenda when they realized that covid-1984 was a nothing burger. After 9-11 went so sideways with tower 7 falling by itself, perfect demolition without anything touching it and people still bought the " terrorist " attack narrative, I think it emboldened them.</p>
<p>Instead of back tracking, arrogance led them to double down on the lockdown hoax and CLEARLY exposed themselves in doing so, women in their 30s who binged on keeping up with the kardashians few years ago now know the deep state exists, that there are some sick people trying to move the world in a Orwellian future...</p>
<p>Yes resources are finite, and the world population can't keep growing at this pace much longer... Live and let live, don't try to play God with the UN 2030 " Sustainable " Agenda which is pretty much depopulation and population control, achieved by financial dependence on massive governments across the world and a cashless society.</p>
<p>There is a reason why the private sector/small business is being destroyed globally, to let oligopolies take over, giant public companies are much easier to control then these pesky small businesses. Forcing people out of work and gig economies, while depositing " money " created out of thin air in their digital wallet in order to survive, that person is at the mercy of the state... He lives and dies at the governments command, refuse your vaccines or criticize the system, pull his digital deposits and he starves in a cashless society.</p>

        <p>That's because if you understand what happened with 9/11 and with many other "conspiracy theories" (a term coined by the CIA in an attempt to discredit anyone who disputed the official narrative of the JFK assassination) then you'd have a much clearer picture of what is happening now and why. Instead of being so aggressive maybe you should stop and consider these things.</p>

You seem to find the idea of the Government doing a terrorist attack on its own people ridiculous, to that I'd just say look at what Hitler did with the Reichstag and research Operation Northwoods. You can call it "nonsense" all you like but you don't even know what these "theories" are. I'm not gonna sit here and redpill you because you're a lost cause and getting butthurt over nothing lol</p>

        <p>I'd advise that you look up the details behind the 9/11 attacks that were not covered very much by the mainstream media, particularly the likes of Building 7. Also look into the people that were in the various intelligence agencies that were warning of an impending attack for months prior to the actual attack, and look at all of the strange things that happened just after, such as the family of Osama Bin Laden being flown out the day after the attacks, the only planes authorised to fly.</p>
<p>If the Government is able to lie about such a massive event such as 9/11 and get away with, as well as get away with covering up the truth behind the JFK assassination, what aren't they capable of lying about?</p>

        <p>I wouldn't say it's directly connected as in all of the same people are involved, as they are two different things. I wouldn't be surprised if a few of the same people behind the scenes had a hand in both things though. It all comes down to the Government staging things on its citizens and the constant incremental infringements on our rights.</p>

        <p>Holy shit, did you really just post a snopes link to "debunk" something? All of these defacto "fact" checkers are self-appointed essentially arms of mainstream media whose only objective is to oppose any and every possible counter narrative and dissenting thought.</p>
<p>The fact that the very first sentence is an outright lie, proves my point. The government had forewarning of a potential attack, verifiable by the several countries who did actually make contact and tried to warn the government.</p>

        <p>I never gave you my opinion on covid, and I also never said "inside job" anywhere, simply that it's a fact they had foreknowledge and did absolutely nothing.

        <p>Snopes is the worst man. Try looking into it and maybe you will see that conspiracy theorist is a weaponized made up term. There are legitimate concerns that many people have tried to bring to our attention for years. Start with agenda 2030 and read between the lines.

        <p>I'm not your friend. And your opinion isn't that the government lied, it's that the evil shadow people working behind the curtains of power literally killed thousands of Americans and then blamed it on the innocent Muslim terrorists who were just happening by in the same place that day. It's blatant conspiracy baiting bullshit not to mention false and unpatriotic. Absolutely 100% fucking shame on you for having these disgusting and wrong views.</p>

        <p>Yet I still want to negate it as much as possible. That's why my car has seatbelts and airbags. I don't deserve to die because someone on facebook told you it was a massive prank.

        <p>I really have noticed recently just how much people are seeing 2 different stories right now. I’ve been working in the office, going out to eat, etc. for months now and I’ve seen a lot of other people doing the same. Bars in my area have been fairly crowded. Yet a couple friends Ive talked to online, as well as most of reddit, are still acting as though we’re in the same place we were back in April. They seem surprised at the fact that I even see that many people when I’m out. People don’t realize that the world’s still been turning around them. And I realize it can be very hard to admit you were wrong in this case, because it means facing the reality that what has kept you inside building anxiety for the last few months wasn’t the virus, but yourself.</p>

        <p>&rt;even the doomers i knoe irl are nowhere near as hardcore as reddit.</p>
<p>I agree. My boyfriend could definitely be seen as a pro-masker, but he came around to admit ideas like advocating for shooting people are ridiculous. We had a conversation where I told him blaming people without masks for the lockdown continuing is akin to blaming an assault victim for being attacked. He understood then.</p>
<p>I went to a birthday party two nights ago. No masks, no social distancing, even a baby (and a few other kids under 10) present the entire time. Having fun like 2020 doesn't exist and everyone enjoying themselves. Party went on until around 2am (I left at 11pm because I became too tired).</p>
<p>&rt;many people on reddit are also extreme introverts</p>
<p>And social media in general. But it makes sense the people who have a life outside of the internet would be living it. I say that as someone who is and has always been an introverted homebody. I've been on leave from work since Sept 14th, so I've had all the time in the world for social media. And I still have other things to do.</p>

<p>Now that we know more about this virus and it has been FULLY politicized the separate sides of the aisle feel it necessary not to go back and say "we over reacted, but here's the updated guidelines". Instead they keep on keeping on with the chicken little shit.</p>

        <p>&rt; Do people here think the numbers of deaths are just fake?</p>
<p>There's funny business with the numbers.</p>
<p>In many instances someone with a positive PCR test within 60 days of their death causes them to be counted as a Covid death even if Covid wasn't the primary cause of death. And we know <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/health/coronavirus-testing.html">many positive PCR tests are likely not indicative of an actual infection</a>. </p>
<p>In other jurisdictions health departments were given discretion for how to count deaths even if there was no positive PCR test.</p>
<p>&rt;What do governments have to gain by keeping us inside?</p>
<p>Many of them acted harshly copying one another. With the first copying China. Walking these actions back now could imply they were never necessary to begin with and all of the negative economic and non-Covid health consequences would be blamed on them.</p>
<p>In other instances it's more simple party politics.</p>
<p>&rt;Are all these governments working together to achieve this? (Including ones that historically have never been able to agree on anything?)</p>
<p>No. A lot of it was piece-wise monkey-see-monkey do. But current government policies across the world vary wildly. e.g. Sweden had very minimal restrictions while places like New Zealand were quite extreme in their reaction. In the U.S. things vary wildly by state.</p>

<p>Still misleading.</p>
<p>Tests done with 40cycles of replication are often too sensitive to detect people who will develop acute viral infection, 872 tests found using these laboratory settings.</p>
<p><a href="https://covidtracking.com/data/national">I would like to remind you that as of yesterday 1,004,261 tests have been done.</a> That means only 0.08% of tests had this issue of using 40C.</p>
<p>Should labs make sure kits are not running 40 cycles? Yes.</p>
<p>At least do 2 stages of testing one with 30C then second of 40C as it could lead to really interesting data to see as people who only show on the 40C mean they have been minorly exposed but minimal danger, It could make some novel contact tracing data if you could get enough people.</p>

<p>&rt;In July, the lab identified 872 positive tests, based on a threshold of 40 cycles. 
&rt;
&rt;With a cutoff of 35, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30.</p>

        <p>~~The article did not report any of the tests are in the range of 35C-39C. Just 40C~~</p>
<p>The article only reported the 872 tests using 40cycles, some tests using a different ranges, viroligists belive cycles should be cut off around 30-35 depending on who you ask.</p>
<p>&rt;With a cutoff of 35, about 43 percent of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 63 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30.</p>
<p>This is just extrapolating data if they found tests using those settings from the 40C data.</p>
<p>edited:</p>
<p>&rt;The F.D.A. noted that people may have a low viral load when they are newly infected. A test with less sensitivity would miss these infections.</p>
<p>&rt;But that problem is easily solved, Dr. Mina said: “Test them again, six hours later or 15 hours later or whatever,” he said. A rapid test would find these patients quickly, even if it were less sensitive, because their viral loads would quickly rise.</p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure pcr test should not be used at all as evidenced by the inventor stating as such. Plus where I am we have no access to know how many cycles the labs are using. There is also financial incentives for labs to give positive tests. Amplify anything enough to get the result you want.</p>

<p>this is not true, they are just paid per test. </p>
<p>The reason why they amplify is they are trying to catch people as early as possible.</p>

<li>Need more time to ponder but I definitely think the numbers shown as corona deaths are probably way too high when you read about how they state corona as a cause of death on some deaths that clearly are from a different cause? They are not fake but I think they are probably way higher than they really are? 2. Any kind of control is good. Throughout history, scaring populations has always been the way to go to get that control. Then the population are easier to manipulate. Also smoke screens?  Create chaos etc so you can push forward an agenda?  An agenda that you might have a harder time selling if nothing else was going on and people had more time to think about what you were up to??? More later</li>

        <p>It’s possible for a virus to be both</p>
<p>A) serious for certain vulnerable people
B) not necessitate shutting down the entire economy</p>
<p>COVID is serious stuff for a small minority of people, the rest of us it poses a very small risk. </p>
<p>We were told from the start that we couldn’t stop the spread of the virus, all we can do is slow the spread so hospitals aren’t overwhelmed. Fine. So we did a short term lockdown.</p>
<p>Months later, schools aren’t open despite a wealth of evidence from Europe and parts of the US that school reopenings dont pose a risk, businesses are getting torn to shreds and people are wearing masks outside despite the science showing that outside glancing spread is rare....and the goal is.....what exactly? Wait for a vaccine? What if one never arrives or isn’t effective? Or takes years?</p>
<p>As for the numbers, it’s not that the numbers themselves are necessarily exaggerated but it’s hard to qualitatively distinguish. If a nursing home patient (where average lifespan is months) who has renal failure dies with COVID and it’s marked as a COVID death — that is a totally different kettle of fish from a healthy 30 year old dropping dead of it.</p>
<p>Our response should be based on who this effects, who it kills, and what role it plays in their death. Instead we just pretend that 200,000 people have been killed out of nowhere by the virus and that some how it was preventable. </p>
<p>So it’s not that the virus isn’t serious for some people, it’s that the reaction has been overblown, completely twisted from the initial intent, and it’s totally disproportionate and being used by people who a) desire power b) want political outcomes in November c) want their home staycation to last forever or d) have no ability to assess risk and have scared themselves indoors.</p>

        <p>In terms of governments working together, yes and no. There is not some vast conspiracy, there is the open fact most of them are members of the WHO and are largely following the same guidance. Additionally they have the same incentives to expand and take more power, and there is a mass hysteria across their country's populations. Simply they are doing this because it is a power grab that they can get away with because there is insufficient resistance from either the population or other countries. </p>
<p>What they are hoping to achieve is furthering power and control. The moves may seem illogical to you but that is because you are imagining that the having a strong country is more important to the politicians than being personally in control. </p>
<p>Why do you think People's Democratic Republic of North Korea, People's Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Australia require exit visas?</p>
<p>Historically, when governments have given themselves the power to impose arbitrary detention 'due to a temporary emergency', what was the main reason they are doing so?</p>
<p>In terms of the numbers, they are exaggerated but that is irrelevant. Even taken at face value they make essentially no impact on your life expectancy so there is no reason to panic. And if there was a real plague, a real concern, there is no need for the government to add further pain and punishment, the virus would do that and they would just need to provide us with the guidance and tools to protect ourselves.</p>

        <p>Look at a book called the great reset and you will understand what is at play. https://www.amazon.ca/COVID-19-Great-Reset-Klaus-Schwab/dp/2940631123
It's not about a virus it's about agenda 2030 the virus is the means to get every government on board.
