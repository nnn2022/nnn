    <strong>Why Don't People Lie About Taking The Emergency Use Authorization Biological Agent/ "Vaccine"?</strong>
    <p><p>I  don't lie because lying is collaborating. It's accepting their false  ideas as if they have a basis, and letting other people believe their  false beliefs are being endorsed.</p>
<ol>
<li>It's an experimental biological agent, not a vaccine</li>
<li>It's  not about whether or not I got the experimental biological agent, it's  about whether I caved to the marketing and bullying like the person  asking me did so they can justify their own reckless endangerment of  themselves (herd mentality)</li>
<li>I  do not accept your inquiry into my health decisions as a valid topic of  conversation, no matter what the screen people programmed you to do and</li>
<li>This  entire propaganda blitz is rooted in so much corruption I'm not going  to engage in the twisted 'reality' it creates where injecting toxins is  supposed to equal health.</li>
</ol>
<p>So  because I'm still hoping to waken a slumberer or two (I've woken a  bunch of ppl irl so far actually) I ignore my own point 3 and say stuff  like, "I'm worried about the long term health effects because they  haven't done long-term studies of this new technology in humans. I'm  going to wait and see." Nobody has REEEEEEEE-ed at me yet and a few have  actually asked to know more.</p>
<p>But  if you have to lie to keep your job or whatever, the fact that the  demand is being placed on you to lie kind of makes it ethical to lie  about this topic, in my opinion. Thankfully I don't have to lie right  now, so I'm not.</p></p>

        <p>a+ post, I agree. I donâ€™t lie about taking a brand new medical treatment because I refuse to participate in this bizarre role play. It only further validates their idiotic choice anyway</p>

        <p>Lying and saying I took it would be layering on peer pressure to those in my life whom are quietly skeptical. Instead of looking at me and seeing a fellow skeptic (and maybe feeling a little less alone in their struggle), they would be seeing another brick in the wall. I won't do that to other humans.</p>

        <p>Yes! Good for you. I remember a quote from Shoah director Claude Lanzmann who had lied to nazis to get their take on their behaviors in WWII. The interviewer was challenging him about how could he to them. He basically said, Of course I lied to them. They had violated the fundamental principle, which is life.</p>
