        <p>A fraction of the other settlements in addition to the 4.5 billion pictured above. </p>
<p><strong>Pfizer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pfizer was sued in a U.S. federal court for using Nigerian children as human guinea pigs, without the childrens’ parents’ consent. Pfizer paid $75 Million to settle in Nigerian court for using an experimental antibiotic, Trovan, on the children. The company paid an additional undisclosed amount in the U.S. to settle charges here. Pfizer had violated international law, including the Nuremberg Convention established after WWII, due to Nazi experiments on unwilling prisoners. <a href="https://www.dmlawfirm.com/crimes-of-covid-vaccine-maker-pfizer-well-documented/">https://www.dmlawfirm.com/crimes-of-covid-vaccine-maker-pfizer-well-documented/</a> </li>
<li>Pfizer paid more than $60 Million to settle a lawsuit over Rezulin, a diabetes medication that caused patients to die from acute liver failure.</li>
<li>In the UK, Pfizer has been fined nearly €90 Million for overcharging the NHS, the National Health Service. Pfizxer charged the taxpayer an additional €48 Million per year for what should have cost €2 million per year.</li>
<li>Pfizer agreed to pay $430 Million in 2004 to settle criminal charges that it had bribed doctors to prescribe its epilepsy drug Neurontin for indications for which it was not approved.</li>
<li>In 2011, a jury found Pfizer committed racketeering fraud in its marketing of the drug Neurontin. Pfizer agreed to pay $142.1 Million to settle the charges.</li>
<li>Pfizer disclosed that it had paid nearly nearly 4,500 doctors and other medical professionals some $20 Million for speaking on Pfizer’s behalf.</li>
<li>In 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that it had reached a $45 Million settlement with Pfizer to resolve charges that its subsidiaries had bribed overseas doctors and other healthcare professionals to increase foreign sales.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>J&amp;J</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Last year, a jury in St. Louis ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/07/13/628684038/jury-awards-4-7-billion-to-women-in-johnson-johnson-talcum-powder-suit">to pay $4.7 billion</a> to women who developed ovarian cancer after using its talcum powder. The company is appealing. </li>
<li>An Oklahoma judge found Johnson &amp; Johnson guilty in fueling the state's opioid crises and ordered the corporation to pay $572 million in a landmark ruling with vast implications. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/johnson-johnson-opioid-verdict-company-found-guilty-in-oklahoma-by-district-judge-in-opioid-abuse-lawsuit/">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/johnson-johnson-opioid-verdict-company-found-guilty-in-oklahoma-by-district-judge-in-opioid-abuse-lawsuit/</a></li>

        <p>They have learnt from their past mistakes and won't do it again even though they can operate in a liability-free environment in which governments pay top dollar for the fastest deliveries. Nothing could go wrong. Stop spreading misinformation and conspiracies.</p>

        <p>Forgive me father for my wrong think, Pfizer is a completely ethical company who has our best interest at heart. I love Pfizer, Thank you Pfizer for having our backs!</p>

        <p>And these are the publicly available <em>settlements</em>, meaning the government found it expedient to accept instead of fully prosecuting. It also doesn't account for any settled with NDAs, you know, so society won't panic and start to distrust our gracious overlords.</p>
