        <p>Questioning is not science. Stating a provable hypothesis and designing a repeatable experiment is science. Random assertions and questions are a fool’s way of establishing their own ignorance and laziness. It is like saying swinging a bat is baseball. Sure it is one minor component, but when done without practice or intent, it is useless, and when done haphazardly, it is potentially dangerous.</p>

        <p>No not within limits. There is no limit as to what you can and cannot question. </p>
<p>Right now there are a lot of scientists starting to question einsteins vision of the speed of light being the limit. If this happens to be false a lot of theories have to be retouched. </p>
<p>If you question gravity you can expect to get a discussion going as to how it works, if you can prove by pointing to literature or experiments that these claims are false true scientists will let go of their idea of gravity. While this seems highly unlikely to happen it is a possibility any scientists will agree with. </p>
<p>False science is shouting " believe in the science!" When literature or key figures opposed to an agenda think differently.</p>

        <p>I think "questioning" something is the wrong phrasing to use, it sounds like you already have a conclusion in mind before you even start the research. Produce alternative theories and see how it holds up in terms of scrutiny and experimentation is perfectly fine, but you dont question something, the questioning was already done when the paper was peer reviewed and published. There can however other less obvious errors or something wrong in the methodology of the experiment, these things tend to be picked up on eventually when others e.g. replicate the experiment and see completely different results.</p>

        <p>I think you're misunderstanding me. </p>
<p>When I say questioning I mean the same way newton figured out gravity, he questioned the science untill that point in time. There was an explanation but it was not significant and didn't work with other science at the time. So in doing that a lot of discoveries where made.</p>
<p>The same could be said when people are right now questioning the speed limit at the speed of light. There are things left unanswered and with figuring out why it's not (if its not) the limit will open up a lot of our knowledge. </p>
<p>It will make a lot of things we seem to not understand how they work now perhaps suddenly all falling into place.</p>
<p>Or not. For now the speed limit is light speed and all we know of science is build upon that, but it might just be that we are in a different "sub-part" of space where the rule is that light is the speedlimit, perhaps when we get out there its possible to go over. </p>
<p>You're free to question that, but it won't be a scientific fact untill you're able to prove it through the peer reviewed research method you addressed. However that does not take away the fact that science allows you to question the rules of science, but the scientific method is to answer that question and make it a fact.</p>

        <p>So you are asking philosophical question, what is science, are we justified in believing what science produces is close to the truth. Referring to your comment about gravity, that does not sound very philosophical to me. Reason why people think speed of light is a cosmological speed limit is because there is no evidence so far for anything else. People can hypothesize a speed limit higher, to test for that you need to measure light traveling faster than the speed of light, which sounds unlike to happen, so why spend time on that kind of theory. I would say it has nothing about questioning, its all about current evidence, and building a theory on it. However back in the time of newton, he was living at  birth of enlightment era, society was heavily anti intellectual compared to today, so obviously not only did newton have to prove his work, he also had to fight against the highly non secular government and their biases, which is where science and rationality comes into play.</p>

        <p>Gravity has been observed and questioned since newton 1687. About 500 years of testing and questioning.</p>
<p>Covid and vaccines have been “irrefutably proven” according to Biden and Government for, less a single year.</p>

        <p>I would say it's a bit more nuanced. As the other responder to the prompt said, evidence is necessary within questioning. </p>
<p>If you actually can prove that it would be advantageous to use another system to gravity, than by all means, questioning it would be fantastic.</p>
<p>However, if all you have are debunked videos and ridiculous theories (like they do), questioning it is stupid.</p>

        <p>Don’t get vaccinated. Looks like this will level off at 300 daily deaths, about 100k a year. Based on the states with the lowest vaccination levels to date, there will be fewer republican voters in 2022 and 2024.</p>
<p>If you live in one of these states and are afraid of the vaccine, don’t get it and don’t wear a mask.</p>

<p>Your opinion after a few hours of YouTube doesn’t really matter for issues that need solid years of study (and I say study not just watching YouTube right) </p>

<p>Not my first language. What does “improve their models” or “don’t help for general population” mean. “Improve their models, to conclude that masks don’t help for general population” nothing can be understood here</p>
<p>Also “help for general population” means you are helping to get general population “help general population” means helping the general population</p>

<p>“Yes, the WHO did not recommend the use of face masks in the first wave. But it was not because it was ineffective, but for fear of misuse. When used and worn properly, face masks are effective protection against the spread of coronavirus according to the WHO.”</p>
<p>It’s not rocket science: wear it tight, over your nose, under your chin and if there is a retainer, shape it to your nose by pressing it onto your nose on both sides.</p>

        <p>There's plenty of vaccine-hesitant people in this world, and there's plenty of acceptance that hesitancy is a natural, acceptable condition. In my part of the world, there's plenty of information available and there's plenty of support to help people address their fears. Some may choose to decline and in every western democracy that is allowed.</p>
<p>What is not acceptable is when people repeatedly parrot the same untruths over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. When somebody tries to claim that the pandemic is planned or that vaccine development has been rushed (for example) then yeah, they're probably going to get a negative reaction.</p>

        <p>Untruths? The vaccine was rushed as hell, and has had several side effects that cause exclusion of who can use them. Effects that only became prevalent enough after release, showing that they had very little in studies. It went from three companies to many producing it, and all of them are different in production and content. The patent was filed in 2015. It is a generalized buster vaccine at best. </p>
<p>What you are saying is that if someone questions it all, and makes connections, and says something, they are a conspiracy theorist. Everything is a conspiracy theory until it is proven.</p>
<p>Do I think that every Amazon worker planned on an extreme transfer of wealth to the top 5% of companies in the world? No. Did that happen? Yes. Did the CEO donate millions to a certain political party, who then shut down an oil pipeline and diverted traffic of that same oil to said CEO's trucking services, increasing their wealth greatly? Yes. When too many things dont add up, you have to start looking for patterns.</p>
<p>And now they say they want everybody to get the vaccine or they wont be able to buy, sell and trade on a "free" market. Gotta have your passport.</p>

<p>No, I'm not saying that at all.</p>
<p>What I'm saying is that it's perfectly acceptable to be concerned that vaccines are available in a short timeframe, but when <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/covid-19-vaccine-safety-and-approval">multiple</a>, <a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/health/conditions/health-alerts/coronavirus-covid-19/protect-yourself-others/covid-19-vaccine/about">independent</a>, <a href="http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/covid-19-vaccine/frequently-asked-questions-about-covid-19-vaccines">reputable</a> <a href="https://www.sussexcommunity.nhs.uk/news/covid-19-vaccinations-brighton-centre/213610?ignore=covid-19-vaccinations-brighton-centre&amp;postid=213610">sources</a> from across the world explain how the timelines were able to be compressed, it becomes frustrating when people persist in asking questions that these address.</p>
<p>It's not like the reason for the compressed timeline is hard to grasp either. The periods of inactivity that usually cause timelines to be extended didn't occur. Similar to how it's taking me ages to paint my house because I can only get to it infrequently: if I took time off work and painted for 8 hours per day instead of 2 hours per week then I'd get the job done a LOT quicker.</p>
