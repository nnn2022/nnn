    <strong>I was open to getting vaccinated, then this happened.</strong>
    <p><p>First, I was previously quite prominent on trans twitter. Waitwaitwait, I agree, they are often insufferable, and Twitter is nuclear waste. I made my mistakes and learned.</p>
<p>I've been considering getting vaccinated simply because my conscience had drawn me to it since my job is close contact (Yes, I know the vaccines are increasingly ineffective and problematic to being with).</p>
<p>So, I go on twitter with my still lefty/queer/trans large following to ask reasonable people to help me get over the line to make the decision. I did speak to a few people who presented a decent case for vaccination in a sensible manner.</p>
<p>However, I experienced much more harassment. Because I was hesitant at all, and hadn't been vaccinated already, I was called a murderer, an ableist, an antivaxxer (for offering to get it!), a shitstain,  a white person, offensive, problematic (for daring question anything) and generally got piled on. Disagreement on vax passports and general authoritarianism was met with white hot rage. Make no mistake, these are ignorant authoritarians painting themselves as liberals because they are incapable of admitting <em>anything</em> they could promote is illiberal by virtue of their own moral superiority.</p>
<p>You know the type already, don't you? Autistic ADHD polyamorous demihemi gender temporal-asexual disabled biblical angel demon kink furries. People who haven't left their house in years, don't exercise, fill their bodies with crap, have no friends, suffer personality disorders, et al. (No problem with people with genuine physical or mental disabilities, no problem with fat people, just, it's exclusively these people coming for me). Hell, a lot of these so-called trans people don't actually transition.</p>
<p>These people are insane, they eat their own. They are so critically bad at discourse that they can take someone who agrees with them and manage to get them to disagree with their own deeply held beliefs by the end of one conversation. There is no room for a viewpoint that deviates from their intuitionalist and contradictory demands. You just have to look at their avatars, hate filled eyes loaded to the eyeballs on anti-depressants and opioids, beneath rainbow glamours.</p>
<p>So, it shows that even if you were to go along with something, it will never be enough, they will always ask for more. They are incapable of proper human interaction. As has been pointed out many times, the people who consider themselves the most good, unselfish, moral, compassionate, virtuous, and anti-fascist are quite often the ones who are seeding the destruction of culture and society. They are hateful, impossibly intractable, and would commit evil acts upon the population if they had any power beyond quivering in their rooms. Unfortunately, liberal elites and institutions are using this vitriol to excuse their power grabs and authoritarianism. They are often hardcore politically illiterate 'communists'.</p>
<p>Most other real life trans people I know see and hate what is happening with this vocal subset of crazy trans fanatics. We just want to integrate and get on with life. I respect reasonable disagreement about trans issues, you can believe what you want. I have anti-trans friends and we get on just fine because I'm not here to push ideology or convince anyone of who I am.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Don't interact with insane people, because they only know wild screaming and harassment. They are broken people, and not all trans people are like this.</p></p>

        <p>Hey, thanks very much, though I've been on this sub since day one :P It's seems to blow lefties minds when they realise the rainbow haired trans woman is not one of them. And it makes a cool surprise for more conservative people to be able to have reasonable conversations with a rainbow hair trans women. Good to meet ya nonetheless!</p>

        <p>Same back at you! Trans people <em>demanding</em> people see them in a certain way is demeaning to themselves, and shows a weakness of identity. Disagreement is a great way towards authenticity and understanding, so, happy to share it with ya!</p>

        <p>I'm not sure if i'm right on this and you may be able to help become better educated on the matter. I do think being trans stems from a neurological condition (not demeaning it I have had certain neurological conditions myself), but to me it seems like a huge amount of people saying they are trans aren't and are just doing it for status/culture and other reasons.</p>
<p>I have met some real trans people in my life who had transitioned and I just treated them like normal, even had to use the 'deadname' for one for legal reasons and she (i think was mtf?) was completely fine and reasonable about it. But the big thing I've noticed is the number of people who say they are trans and the number of people who are seems to have a massive difference, just wanted to ask if that is your experience of it?</p>

        <p>I do wonder about the correlation of neurological issues and trauma with being trans. There seems to be some correlation, although there's also plenty of 'normal' trans people with 'normal' upbringings. Personally, I try to just consider it a variation, I never wanted to be trans but the dysphoria stuff is deeply rooted for some of us, and can be totally crippling. I only transitioned because I legit had no choice due to the anguish, and recognise that if it were something I only <em>wanted</em> to do, then I wouldn't do it. Because who the heck would want to go through transition and the social alienation that comes with it!</p>
<p>That said, there is definitely an uptick in people who are appropriating the trans identity for their own personal reasons, or because it's cool like a tattoo. For example, I know genuine non-binary people who really struggle every day with dysphoria and how to fit into society, but I also know people who label themselves as non-binary yet do not share those struggles and only seem to be doing it for attention. Folks who don't transition or use these labels just for clout, or because of a different mental illness.</p>
<p>Watched some SJW cringe recently about 'temporal aromantic asexuals', which means people that don't have a sex drive except when they do, and don't feel romantic attraction except when they do. It's just an excuse to seem special, and in some cases I think is a method to control and abuse others in friendships and relationships. Also 'agender' people who pick and choose gender characteristics as convenient, yet call themselves trans. There has to be a delineation between legit trans people and those who are simply gender non-conforming.</p>
<p>The whole thing is a mess, you might often find that those trans people who just want to keep their heads down and fit into society are the most genuine sufferers of 'transsexualism.'</p>
<p>(EDIT - Apologies if that doesn't make a lot of sense, trying to translate trans language into normal speak is difficult.)</p>

        <p>That's fair enough. I imagine that would have been a rough time for you. I think some of your things about 'normal' people is a bit off, some people might seem normal, but you may not understand the pressures that they were under, life can be complex.</p>
<p>Interesting you use transsexualism rather than transgender. In your eyes what do you think the differences between gender and sex are?</p>

        <p>Sure, 'normal' is a generalisation so it won't work on many levels. You're absolutely right about life and people being complex, we all have some very interesting deep seeded stuff going on, often unconsciously.</p>
<p>I mean, I can only speak for myself. Changing sex isn't possible, it's fixed, although due to genetic issues with intersex people (&lt;1% of population), it seems to be there are more than two sexes. As a 'trans woman' my (what one may call) gender has always been woman. The problem is my sex, and the solution was to become a facsimile of a woman, thus the attempt would be transsexual. I'm clearly still male, but live as a woman in hope that society will accept me.</p>
<p>It's not something I ever wanted to do. Have you ever had an addiction? I compare it to having a permanent feeling of withdrawl without ever having taken the drug. It's a crippling way to live, but by transitioning, I can move past it and focus on other things. In trans circles this is called being <em>truscum</em>.</p>
<p>Gender <em>may</em> be <em>partially</em> a social construct, but there are clearly immutable factors of what makes a man or a woman <em>in general</em>.</p>
<p>I'm not going to pretend I have a good or concrete answer.</p>
<p>There's a lot of people out there pretending to be trans (<em>transtrenders)</em> and a lot of others who want to completely subjugate what sex and gender means for an ideological agenda.</p>

        <p>Very interesting thanks for all that. Ig my question would be especially for the second part is, had their been another way to either rid yourself of the dismorphia that was non-surgical and either hypno-therapy of some kind or even some therapies using deliberate tripping on certain drugs to help your mind work around these problems (obvs only if it was a safe and tested procedure i know that is all very experimental but has been used for ptsd treatments) would you have taken it instead?</p>
<p>Also sorry for my abhorrent lack of grammer in that paragraph. I have to do a lot of that in my job and rn my brain is tired.</p>

        <p>It's all good! This is one of the questions therapists can ask trans people before they can get access to treatment.</p>
<p>For a long time before transition, I wondered the same thing, why would people do that to their bodies? Why can't they just love themselves as they are? If we were in a perfect world of acceptance, then surely they wouldn't have to transition?</p>
<p>When I figured my gender dysphoria out, I came to realise that even in a perfect, accepting world, I would still have gender dysphoria and would have to transition. As much as a pill or a therapy could have made my life a lot easier, I wouldn't be me anymore, so it wouldn't be the right decision to be the most authentic human I could be.</p>
<p>It's tough to make sense of, but I liked living as a man, but it just wasn't something I could cope with anymore. The gender dysphoria took up quite a lot of my brain space almost consistently since I was six year old. I was broken and couldn't live anymore. Since I transitioned, I don't think about it anymore and can get on with my life.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't even think it's necessarily about gender at all, it's just something that needed to be done to move forward with life. It's very annoying, and I wouldn't have done it unless absolutely necessary. Gotta say though, transitioning was defo the funniest thing that's happened in my life, it's so freaking weird!</p>
<p>Also, tripping on 'certain drugs' actually helped confirm it for me, very interesting philosophical revelations. It may be fair to say it's all in my head, but it was permanently there, so the choice seems to be either sort it out, or suffer for never having truly lived. I try having 'guy days' sometimes and it just doesn't work out mentally, and also because the hormones worked too well, lol.</p>

        <p>That's very interesting to read. I only asked concerning the drugs because that helped me mentally work through some of my issues. I  do think it sounds like maybe you did it for the right reasons. One of the things i'm not a fan of is how so many people care so much about what other people think.</p>
<p>I know it's a natural thing, but not caring about what others think about me has made me been more myself and more happy with myself, weirdly has made me seem more likeable.</p>

        <p>I've noticed the same. The more we discern and set proper boundaries without the need for people pleasing and codependency has made me feel like more of an asshole, but has actually made me come across as more likeable. Guess self-respect pays off, huh!</p>

        <p>Eh i mean i don't but if i do think i've overstepped I apologise. I think part of it is human nature and another part is exacerbated by social media. People crave other humans validation but idk why, there tend to be very few people in your life who really matter.</p>

        <p>To be honest it's something I know absolutely nothing about, so couldn't say. I've heard the term before, but haven't been interested in trans stuff for a long time so didn't look it up.</p>
<p>In my experience it was a couple of decades of deep deep repression that hit real hard over a period of months and years. Kinda like holding a bursting Pandora's Box closed, but as soon as it starts spilling over it became an avalanche.</p>

<p>Rainbow haired trans women are more then welcome here, this is about resisting the “new normal” not about identity politics. But you said you’ve been here from the start so you already know that 😝</p>
<p>Seems like the trans community has gotten a bit toxic, turning in their own people simply because they don’t conform to their rigid ideological beliefs. Please correct me if I’m wrong.</p>

        <p>Oh, you're absolutely right, and it's beyond toxic at this point. I tried to go along with them for a while years ago, but found out it's a straightjacket getting ever tighter. They've wrapped themselves in impossible contradictions, which might explain why the intensity of vitriol and number of identities continues to accelerate.</p>

        <p>Just to say much respect to you. I am an un-educated dinosaur when it comes to gender issues, so to make it simple for myself I gave up judging people by the 'group' they supposedly align themselves with and try to emphasise an individual's own personal character when it comes to forming a judgement on them as a person. It is difficult to find out who people really are as individuals these days - I believe that for many people,  individual values and beliefs have been heavily masked by a chosen group indentity.</p>
<p>Based on your post you seem to be a very well reasoned and level headed person and it is refreshing to discuss these issues in an open way.</p>
<p>I share your sentiment. I was on the fence about getting the vaccine (UK). Sharing this information with co-workers during what I thought was a friendly discussion, proved to be anything but. The 'antivax/conspiracy theorist/tinfoil hat wearer' slanders came out as you might think. After Michael Gove (a UK parliamentarian) called us 'selfish' for not yet being vaccinated on that same day, you might say this tipped the balance and dissuaded me from taking the vaccine at this present time.</p>
<p>Just keep continually assessing the risk/reward and you will be fine. I find I often entrench myself in a particular position so I have to make an extra effort to continually assess data and challenge my positions on things.</p>
<p>All the best to you.</p>

        <p>Hey there! Thank you for your decency and openness, such positive attitudes help make the world a better place.</p>
<p>I'm sorry people have been acting this way, I've noticed when vaccine talk comes up it's like a different person starts speaking through their mouth, and it's incredibly disturbing. </p>
<p>I really love that you're making constant critical analyses about this stuff, I try to do the same to not get caught in a mindset, challenging ego and blind spot assumptions is hard work, but totally worth it!</p>

        <p>Hey there! Welcome!</p>
<p>I've been dying to ask, but...</p>
<p>Can you explain the difference between transsexual, transgender and transvestite? </p>
<p>Is a trans woman someone who was born a man but decided to have surgery?</p>
<p>FWIW, I used to be gay back when it was LGB and I completely 'switched off' until I discovered the 'T.' I haven't found someone willing to explain and the Google definitions are just confusing. </p>
<p>Thanks, and sorry for derailing your thread.</p>

        <p>I haven't really talked about this stuff in years, but I can try.</p>
<p>Transsexual is the term old school trans people used to denote those who fully transition with surgery, hormones, and changing appearance. It mostly describes people who transition straight from male to female, or female to male. Most younger trans people hate this term and will attack even self-identified transsexuals for using it.</p>
<p>Transgender is a catch all term to include those above, along with everyone else on the trans 'spectrum', i.e. non-binary people, agender people, genderqueer and all the other 72 made up genders. Many people using these strange categories really do struggle with gender dysphoria (the feeling of not being right in your own body) and truly might struggle to understand their identities. However, it also includes many people who use transgender as a fad, or those who say they are transgender but don't transition. They use it as a catch all term to include people from transsexual to people who 'feel like a different gender that day.' Being so over inclusive, it invites a lot of creeps are weirdos who appropriate the term for their own weirdness. Some will transition with surgery/hormones, some may just change their look, some will do nothing and demand you use different pronouns for them anyway. I won't pretend to understand or agree with the increasing expansion of the term to include anyone who has an inkling feeling that they may be gender non-conforming.</p>
<p>A transvestite is someone who likes dressing in the clothes other the opposite sex, either just for fun, but most often for a sexual thrill. Some are harmless, plenty are degenerates.</p>
<p>I hope that makes some sense? The transgender terms become more messy by the day and often change. It's no wonder people are sick of it.</p>

<p>Doesn't gender dysphoria give rise to people wanting to become transsexuals? (Did I get that right?)</p>

        <p>Yeah, more or less. Gender dysphoria is the feeling of dis-ease that makes life harder for trans people, leading them to transition. Gender dysphoria is generally strongest with transsexual people who fully transition, but for some trans[gender] people it might not be as strong meaning they don't need/want to make as many changes.</p>
<p>Further down the 'spectrum' it gets to the point some people don't have gender dysphoria at all, but they will act/dress in gender non-conforming ways, but still use the term transgender. It's around there it starts getting more messy. That said, I've known non-binary people (those who identify as neither male or female) who struggle with really intense gender dysphoria, but it's inconclusive whether they experience themselves as male or female so they end up trying to create their own identity just to get through the day. They aren't trying to subvert the boundaries of male and female on purpose, they're just struggling. Folks I'd legitimately call 'they', but I wouldn't use any of these made up pronouns, because they're usually made up by kids who just want to break tradition.</p>

        <p>Welcome to the group. There is so much bullshit spread about what is said or discussed here or the community. I just had one person this morning saying that this group was constantly throwing homophobic slurs etc and I’ve never seen one person do that here in the last 2 months!

        <p>I'm glad you caught that. There is very little homophobia, transphobia on this sub, and next to zero ableism or racism. I've been on this sub from the first week and am on regularly, so I can vouch for it. It's just convenient for some people to drop these weighted terms for the purposes of shaming and delegitimization.</p>

<p>One day she's talking to me about someone who's white. But she immediately <em>apologizes</em> for describing them as 'white'. Goes "sorry, I mean Caucasian".</p>
<p>Is "white" literally a derogatory term in most circles now? She's a boomer or old Gen Xer, this was in a professional setting, she's religious and absolutely not an activist or lgbtq, genuinely friendly.... i don't get it.</p>

        <p>I passed some black street preachers on the way home yesterday.  I live in a city/neighborhood where whites are a small minority. 
 The preachers were in a discussion and when I was waiting for the crossing light, they raised their voices.  They started talking about how someone had stolen everything and raped all these people - children, women, and men.  "He" should come here an apologize, and "He's a "Devil", etc.</p>
<p>I did not look back at them, but I have a strong suspicion I was the target of anti-white racism yesterday.  Could be wrong, but it's the kind of anti-colonial language that's popular in some circles.</p>

<p>I DONT CARE IF ANYONE GETS VACCINATED. I don’t want to convince anyone not to!!! But I am not ready for it myself. </p>
<p>There is a lot of shaming on the internet right now, but please know this is not a reflection of the real world. We must respect people’s individual choices for their bodies and do what is right for ourselves. I will suggest stepping away from social media, as this is what I have done to think clearly and make sure my thoughts are my own (GroupThink is too real y’all)</p>

        <p>Hey, thank you for sharing this! There's plenty of queers who see what's going on, and it worries me that a lot of them have at least been quietly removed from their social groups. I'm sure you know yourself how fickle and toxic queer social groups can be at the best of times.</p>
<p>Seems pretty clear, the folks who respect free will respect freedom, those who don't demand authoritarianism.</p>

        <p>Yes. Literally since the end of WW2, actual anti-fascists had been warning that the next wave of intolerant fascism would arrive under the guise of tolerance. Any thinking person can see that the social justice warriors and antifa, who go on about tolerance, are anything but. They are hate-filled little goblins attack and harassing everyone they disagree with.</p>

        <p>Do you know anyone else from the community that feels the same way?  Or is it a type of groupthink/indoctrination that keeps them from seeing what is really going on?   It seems like close-knit groups have extreme myopia, and it's only getting worse.  Of course there are the opposite people.  A tiny fraction of them get hospitalized for China virus, and then they say dumb shit like "I didn't get the vaccine because of my strong conservative community".  Al of that hurts the real message, that China virus is not dangerous to most people, but the vaccines are.</p>

        <p>So, I think when people come out, they're looking for a community, and it's natural to find a few 'fellow queers' and start falling into those groups. They will educate people with things that can start reasonable, but then start getting out of hand. Some people, myself included, can get caught in groupthink and agenda pushing, developing a mindset that everyone is out to get them. Some folks live in denial and seem to get ever deeper into the mess, and because one false move can lead to being totally ostracised, they get trapped.</p>
<p>Given time, a good few will grow up and grow out of it, while others will become more radical. I know a lot of people who were deep into this, but when rational conversations are allowed and you show them it's ok to have individual thoughts, they can break the trance and start taking care of themselves. A lot of people in these communities develop severe mental illness and personality disorders, but with opportunities to find their individuality, I know many of us who have calmed down and de-radicalised. Just typical encroaching extremism through corrupt defensive ideology, imo.</p>

        <p>&rt; You know the type already, don't you? Autistic ADHD polyamorous demihemi gender temporal-asexual disabled biblical angel demon kink furries. People who haven't left their house in years, don't exercise, fill their bodies with crap, have no friends, suffer personality disorders, et al. (No problem with people with genuine physical or mental disabilities, no problem with fat people, just, it's exclusively these people coming for me). Hell, a lot of these so-called trans people don't actually transition.</p>
<p>People in this sub always make these generalizations, and sometimes there is overlap but I see fit, young, hot, super social people who support this shit. My physical therapist, a hot, blonde haired, blue eyed dude in his 30s was badgering me about my vaccine status (he's done this <strong>every</strong> time I go into the sessions), and being all like "Wow, I've heard the Delta variant is filling up hospitals all over the US. I feel like something needs to be done about the unvaxxers. I know <em>you're</em> not one (I told him my doctor recommended I not take it but he still thinks I should get it anyhow), but those people are monsters. They should go to jail." This was a real life interaction I had. One of many. Lots of "normies" feel this way, it's not just "basement dweller furry otherkin" that feel that way. Conversely, my actual unemployed "live in his mama's basement" friend is staunchly against the tyranny.</p>

        <p>This so much. My twentysomething niece who started her medical residency a few months before Covid hit is a total cultist(at the Mayo they were wearing 3 masks at one point), as is her boyfriend, who has a tech infrastructure job at an important law firm. They are the portrait of young success, condo on the beach(which daddy helped with ofc), border collie....</p>

        <p>Im always wondering how much of the attitute actually stems from an inherent dislike/hate of any given group and how much of it is attributed to these topics being heavily politizised (far beyond the scope of what many might imagine).</p>
<p>I mean, I get why people take an issue in it. I do too. It is coming up too often, too often it appears forced. Its not my topic, I dont understand/disagree with the thoughts/ideas behind it. But guess what, I dont have to. My life is not affected at all whether you identifiy as a girl/boy  or toaster, whether you have real boobs, fake boobs, no boobs, wear make-up or not, pee while you sit or stand.... it is not affecting my life in the slightest, why would I care about how you handle that?</p>
<p>Really, do not understand why people take so much offense in how others live their lifes. Just be nice to other humans and nature and focus on your own happiness, its really that simple.</p>

        <p>White people can't identify as toasters, because it's racist to turn white bread brown :')</p>
<p>Thank you for the attitude, I try to do the same. Even if people don't want to see me as I am myself, that's totally fine tho. A big problem for trans people is feeling threatened, getting defensive, then getting hateful, same for anti-trans folks. Disagreement can lead to the kinds of conversations that buoys hearts in finding empathy and compassion through it, great place to experience shared humanity.</p>

        <p>Thanks! I know there's the odd anti-trans post here, but I often laugh along with em because they are ridiculous, and elites are clearly subverting and conflating basic trans rights into this twisted agenda that's gotten out of control.</p>
<p>I've been on this sub since the beginning and I love it. Freedom, asking questions, discourse, courage against the odds, moral education, boundaries. Maybe you can empahise, but this sub has kept me sane and made me feel so much less alone!</p>

        <p>You may be right. I'm trying to figure things out beyond the propaganda, and it's not easy to disseminate what's right or reasonable to do. The vax pushers certainly make it easy to not take it, as do folks here with rational concerns.</p>

        <p>Omggggg don’t get me started on the LGBTQ+ community and having ANY opinion that counteracts the mainstream narrative that “the government loves and cares for all of us and this vaccine is going to save the world”. I’ve either lost whatever gay friends I’ve had, or I’ve had to outright lie and distance myself by choice from these people knowing I could never be honest. It’s ridiculous. For some an “open and loving community” that should know first hand what being a rebel and an outlier in society feels like, we sure are, to sum it up, BS.</p>

        <p>Hey, thanks for sharing and being open. I put it down as an ego driven need to be morally superior. Seems to come from a place of weakness, feeling threatened, and needing others to validate their experience. It really sucks losing queer friends over a simple unwillingness to even consider other viewpoints.</p>
<p>Maybe it's ironic, but more recently I've been getting on better with anti-trans conservative who've been more reasonable about trans stuff than pro-trans liberals.</p>
<p>Hope you're taking care of yourself, you'll find better friends! :D</p>

        <p>This reminds me pf how i became pro life. I passed a prolife man in the street holding a sign with an abortion on it, and it wasnt this married man with kids who turned me pro life, but rather the 14 year old pro abortion girls who crowded around him and the filth that came from their mouths. </p>
<p>It was literally the pro choice doctrine that turned me pro life</p>

        <p>I’m active on Twitter and though I’m not queer, a lot of my hobbies are popular with the type of person you described above. They do “eat their own” and sadly they’ll never get anything done because they’re weak in every sense of the word and unstable. If you’re a vegetarian, they attack you for not being vegan. If you’re a feminist, they call you transphobic. It’s never enough. </p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about making a second account to openly follow and tweet about “anti-vaxx” stuff because I’m ironically terrified of “coming out” as…I don’t even know, questioning the government and corporations? Being fully pro-choice? My stance should NOT be seen as radical or extremist.</p>

        <p>Yep, you're right on that. It's always more and more, and smacks of Cluster B personality disorders, which again they don't want to admit more queer people suffer from. The whole culture seems to have been subverted by borderline, narcissistic, and psychopathic traits. The scum rises to the top. Personally, I went on twitter again for two days looking for rational discourse, and I think the best avenue to that is to not use twitter, it's a mental health nightmare.</p>

        <p>There are some accounts I think you might like, but if you’re looking for civil discourse, Twitter is notorious for its users being ready to get violently angry about everything. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone change their mind about something after a Twitter thread.</p>
<p>I use it for hobby stuff and try to ignore the pro-vax/“woke” garbage that inevitably shows up on my feed because one of the artists I follow liked something. Just go in knowing that it caters to midwits and that helps.</p>

        <p>Twitter is built to create echo chembers and hate. But twitter Is 1% of 1% of population and a place you don't need to visit. Glad to hear you got redpilled op. Careful it's not so rosy on this side like it was in the matrix. </p>
<p>Try your best to get off social media and you'll be happier and healthier. Be sceptical of what others say. Especially if they have a vested interest to lie like big pharma or the media that sell them advertisement space...</p>

        <p>I totally agree with you, and thank goodness Twitter isn't representative of reality, the world is crazy enough without all that. Defo very important to keep an open mind and a discerning eye wherever we end up. Would rather have a good life than an easy one, doing what I can to harden up and take on greater responsibility, it's very empowering.</p>

        <p>The second post I've seen like this in two days and makes me suspicious. The cancer starts to spread pretty quickly. I hate to tell people but the LGBTQ community has been the epitome of tyranny for decades now. "Believe like I believe or we will destroy you." The LGBTQ community has been the biggest promoter of propaganda in history. I believe The Muppets just came out with a movie/episode targeted at 3-year-olds about a trans muppet. Then, I am supposed to believe that the gay san Fransisco choir's song about coming for our children was just "satire". No, the fuck it was not because your actions prove otherwise. </p>
<p>If you want to be gay or whatever, be my guest, but the sheer amount of propaganda that we are all exposed to by the LGBTQ community tells me it's not just about their own personal choice it's about making me accept their personal choice and to be a champion for it. Thanks but no thanks.</p>

        <p>I don’t want to speak for OP, but I think that’s the point they were kind of making about a lot of LGBTQ groups being tyrannical, especially on the internet. </p>
<p>I want to be openly queer because being in a relationship is a big part of my life. That does NOT mean I am okay with pride events showing kink or anything like that, and truthfully I am not even sure how I feel about the whole “pride month” in general anymore. I don’t need to celebrate that because it doesn’t make me special. It’s just a facet of my life. </p>
<p>I won’t try to change your mind. I can only hope that through engaging with respectful people from the queer community who aren’t down with all that shit and are just PEOPLE first and foremost, you will see us as folks who just want to let everyone live their lives however the hell they want.</p>

        <p>Mm, I feel this. I went stealth a while back because it's just not worth it. My pride died when queerness became coercive, intractable, and completely illiberal. I know other folks who have went back into the closet because the attitudes of the most vocal queer groups are actually making it more dangerous rather than less.</p>
<p>Just like my own experience, queer rights had so many of their goals met, and snatched defeat from the jaws of victory but pushing too hard too fast for too much.</p>

        <p>I agree with you. There's definitely an agenda above and beyond regular queer people just wanting to get on with their lives. The propaganda is insidious and pernicious, and I take a lot of flak from all sides calling it out. Don't get me wrong, I believe there's a place for queer representation, but there's something much more sinister going on that predates my own experiences with the queer 'community.'</p>
<p>It's simply counterproductive to be pushing it in people's faces this much. The average person doesn't seem to care whether folks are LGBT+ or not, they just want to be left alone and not forced into some coercive rainbow dance and recital of allegiance. Underneath it, a lot of queer people themselves just want to be left alone without all this BS too, but the most vitriolic queers seem set on creating a dystopic nightmare.</p>

        <p>Trans communities hate white people even though a white person is 460% more likely to be trand than any other ethnicity... almost as if trans is associated with priviledge? You said they called you a 'white person' as an insult. Food for thought.</p>

Of course there are bigots out there, but the large majority of people don’t care what you are.

<p>If they sit inside all day and are incapable of even wanting to ATTEMPT to provide sufficient positive change for themselves, I see no problems with sending them on a one-way trip to either land of their authoritarian dreams: North Korea or Mainland China.</p>
<p>Because the US is among the last places we can have such civil liberties in place. Western Civilization was among the best advances a good chunk of humanity ever got to enjoy and benefit from in all of history.</p>

        <p>There is some truth to that, I really struggle with the idea of trans women in sports. I get there's trans women who really want to compete, but personally I wouldn't want to compete in women's sport, even though I'd likely lose.</p>
<p>There are a few other issues that create friction with cis-women. If trans women would have calmed down there could have been better compromises.</p>
<p>What I meant above was the idea of lefties in general using 'white cishet male' as a punching bag for their entire ideology.</p>

        <p>Yep. Actually experienced it years ago when I started to question how out of hand they were getting. If anyone can be anything, then nothing matters. If the LGBT+ community doesn't police their own, someone else will have to come in and do it, and a lot of them really have gone too far. I can excuse some of the wildness from people in their teens and twenties, but the OG generations are getting older now and need to grow up and see reality. They don't see the irony of how their attitudes make it worse for everyone.</p>

        <p>I’m autistic and bisexual and I just stay quiet about it because I know they’ll just jump down my throat and cancel me again. </p>
<p>Im over here like knowing that vax passports will affect the disabled and chronically ill the most, like we already have problems getting out and doing things and are more susceptible to adverse reactions and worse. But yet, none of my disabled online mutuals are questioning the ableism here it’s just like get it or you’re an evil person reeeeeee!!!</p>
<p>But honestly I think their mental state is just going to get worse from here with the neurological problems and micro blood clots in the brain that come from the clot shot. </p>
<p>My aunt has had it and she was once a very articulate woman and the last conversation my mother had with her she was slurring, mispronouncing and forgetting words. Which is absolutely unlike her. </p>
<p>I don’t care if I’m a “bad person” if it is as dangerous as we feared and that censored scientists have predicted, then I guess I’ll be a survivor and be able to tell the story to the generations after when I’m old about the time when you were called a bad person for preserving your own bodily autonomy</p>

        <p>It's weird how immunocompromised people are the only people whose needs matter on Twitter, and that we must all mask up and stay home for the rest of our lives. But those are precisely the people who will be screwed by vaccine passports because they can't take the vaccine.</p>
<p>It's also weird how Twitter cares so much about accessibility, right up until you talk about how the constant announcements to wear a mask in supermarkets give you sensory overload.</p>

        <p>Oh yeah that for sure. Nobody is talking about how that affects autistic people too. I had to buy a baggy soft knit fabric mask that doesn’t cling to my face too much because of the sensory issues with wearing something on my face that’s restricting. Even then I really struggle when walking long distances or even uphill with them on my face because of a history of asthma I have to take a break to have a gasp of air. Sometimes when nobody’s looking I’ll pull it down for a few seconds to have a bit of fresh air on my face or escape to the toilet to have a break lmao.</p>
<p>And then there’s the news that it doesn’t actually work… which is just lovely, another thing I just have to do to make the neurotic people in society comfortable while I suffer in silence with my sensory issues</p>

        <p>Hey, thanks for the reply! And please let me start by saying I have no issue with autistic people, it just happens to be by whatever reason, that in this case it was exclusively autistic queers attacking me, but the judgement is on their personality. It saddens me to see them do it so often, not the first time I've seen abusive people hide behind their autism, because in my waking life I have as many autistic friends as I do allistic friends, and I love them to pieces, because of who they are as individuals.</p>
<p>I'm sorry people in these communities have been attacking you too. It's really scary how disabled, mentally, and chronically ill people have been throw under the bus during this entire situation. Even with the vax passports, the so called 'unselfish, good people' are happy to keep spreading it, discard the elderly, vulnerable and disabled so they can party with their magic vaccines. Such damn hypocrites when it comes to public health.</p>
<p>Good on you for sticking by your principles, because the flip-flopping u-turn goalpost movers will sway with whatever breeze they're told to.</p>

<p>Don't broadcast your medical history and sexual orientation/gender to a bunch of strangers on the internet. Getting on with life will be become much easier.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry about what happened, it's nothing nice, but in the end, good to know the truth that was behind the smoke and mirrors. With my limited experience of someone of the most standard gender and sexuality it was very easy to assume that all the queer and trans people are left wing monsters and detached communists, who behave exactly the way you said. That was from my own observation, mostly of the Twitter space indeed. I have a similar suspicion that there are many weird "internauts" who will never leave the room etc. and agree that the best way is to avoid.</p>
<p>So it's a nice experience for me to read what you had to say.</p>
<p>Welcome, here you can actually share ideas and ask questions, I even post controversial stuff sometimes and it's ok too. You get quality replies even from people against it, like I did with my nearly-pro-life post lately, lol.</p>
<p>Your post would be perfect for r/WalkAway, do you wanna share with them too? More people should see it.</p>

        <p>Hey, thanks for the kind message! I mean, a lot of them are wild lefties, and there's a significant communist trans contingent that I've witnessed make false accusations and oust people to purify their social groups for the own benefits. Sometimes they use their minority status as an excuse to abuse. That said, there's a lot of good queer/trans people out there, you just won't see them posting or screaming. There's even a contingent of classical conservative minded people who follow the mantras of individuality and minding their own business.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened with so called liberalism, it's used to be about free speech, bodily autonomy, equal rights, etc, but whatever they are now isn't that. They're simply authoritarians hiding behind vulnerable status who read the cliffnotes of Das Kapital and made it their ideology.</p>
<p>Thanks, I'll check that sub out. Have a good day!</p>

        <p>Thanks. Agree, "liberalism", "democracy" and "equality" used to have different meanings and today it's quite clear that these words were overwritten and their 2021 meanings became close to exact opposites of them...</p>

        <p>Thanks. Keep trying to tell other trans folks it's the way to go. Have conversations with people, be reasonably normal, don't demand respect or acceptance. Instead show who you are, be willing to have difficult conversations, and dammit, have a sense of humour!</p>

        <p>Well thought out and articulate post. This is the reason why I choose not to associate with the LGBT+ community (as a gay man). As a whole, the most intolerant group of people I know and they will not accept you if you have any views that contradict the community as a whole. It actually makes me quite sad. As someone who is “different” even those like me will not accept me for who I am.</p>

        <p>Yeah, you don't need me to tell you how disappointing it is. Actually met a group of anti-lockdown gay men recently who have formed their own little enclave, and it's cool to see them support each other. It's tough to have pressure coming from all sides, but there's good ones of us out there. I accept you as you are, are there's others out there who will too.</p>

        <p>This resonates so much with me. My trans friends know i would lay down everything for their rights- we're all human and everyone deserves the same basic freedoms. One on one, we can actually have a discussion and agree to disagree. But in any sort of even small group setting, the echo chamber begins and I'm attacked. I can't believe how easily they are willing to take away another group's freedom after all the bs the community had to endure to get to this point. And still deal with. But you're absolutely right- you can't blame an entire group for a few bad apples</p>

        <p>Yep, one on one trans people will tell you how they really feel, but in groups can act very differently. It's strange to see, though I get some of the basic psychology behind it. It boggles my mind as well, trans people made a ton of gains in a few shorts years, but they kept demanding more and more and it has backfired. They don't seem to understand the concessions society has made for them in record time. Careful with them in groups, in my experience they scapegoat very quickly, Terms including any part of "cishet white man" roll off the tongue too easily as a catch all reason for the world's ills.</p>

        <p>\&rt;So, it shows that even if you were to go along with something, it will never be enough, they will always ask for more. They are incapable of proper human interaction. As has been pointed out many times, the people who consider themselves the most good, unselfish, moral, compassionate, virtuous, and anti-fascist are quite often the ones who are seeding the destruction of culture and society. They are hateful, impossibly intractable, and would commit evil acts upon the population if they had any power beyond quivering in their rooms. Unfortunately, liberal elites and institutions are using this vitriol to excuse their power grabs and authoritarianism. They are often hardcore politically illiterate 'communists'.</p>

        <p>I’m not part of that community but have friends in it, some of which now no longer identify with that “community” for the reasons you stated. My outsider theory is that ironically many of these people grew up being outsiders and possibly even being bullied which leads to a sense of powerlessness. So psychologically it makes sense that they would in other ways seek to follow the path of least resistance that leads to them being part of the dominant narrative and the virtuous group who (thinks they) now hold the power. Kind of like the concept from that old movie Revenge of the Nerds, in a way. It’s a shame that these communities don’t encourage real personal growth and healing from trauma like every individual is entitled to - unless it is only via pharmaceuticals for mental illness and strongly identifying only with a narrow set of ideologies that are acceptable to the group. It is further traumatizing to anyone who sees what it really going on and is then being gaslit by some of the only people they thought would be their ride or dies.</p>

        <p>Yeah, I like that parallel to revenge of the nerds, and there may be something to it. I forget that I lived a successful life living as a man for most of my 20's, but a lot of other trans folks were maybe bullied more and didn't get the chance to have friends, and they're bitter. It certainly checks out with the people I talked to, because they spend all their time on twitter with few real life friends, don't leave the house, and seem to have weak prospects.</p>
<p>It's only when I went through personal development after transitioning when I broke the victim mindset transitioning and trans ideology can create. You can see it with covid too, these are the folks who don't believe they should get fit and healthy, treat their bodies and minds like crap, yet demand other people make sacrifices for <em>their</em> health.</p>
<p>I'm sorry they acted that way towards you, the fickle nature of queer communities is depressing, when they have such amazing opportunities to grow as people in body, mind, heart, and soul.</p>

        <p>I don’t think fighting ableist with slurs is the way to go. If you’re still up for getting vaccinated you should consider it. It lowers the risk of you ending up in the ICU and helps lowering the risk for people who can’t get the vaccine to get infected. I don’t understand why people refuse to get the vaccine when they’re clearly able to. Is it just the COVID vaccine or are you against ALL vaccines?</p>

        <p>Hey. Well yeah, as a disabled person myself, it's very disappointing to be receiving slurs, so I just blocked them and vented on here.</p>

<p>I've had all the other vaccines over the course of my life, and it's been a big mistake by the hardest pushers to assume people who are hesitant about this one are anti-vaxxers. This vaccine campaign is shady as all heck, and there are doubtlessly greed motives to an extent on very many fronts.</p>
<p>I think one reason also people don't want to get it is the ever changing goalposts. First it was all the vulnerable, then over 50's, the over 18's, now over 16's, and soon to be children. Next year it will be mixed with the flu shot which will turn the covid pass into a flu pass, and for a lot of people they've drawn their line in the sand.</p>
<p>Like I say, I'm potentially willing to get the vaccine for my own reasons, but I wouldn't benefit from it because I refuse to go along with all the rest, <em>especially</em> if I'm vaccinated. Doesn't help in the USA with mandates being reinstated even for vaccinated people.</p>

        <p>Doesn’t sound like a good argument against getting the vaccine if you ask me. Sounds like an argument that people are jerks online, which isn’t limited to one group of people. Ideology exists on both sides. This place is full of it, I’ve been one of the only people the past week or two arguing that the people here believe insane things.</p>
<p>The reality is, the virus exists (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7239045/),  more people in the United States died last year from all causes than was statistically expected ( https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2778234 ),  and if the virus wasn’t safe we would be witnessing significant numbers of people with side effects since literally millions of people have been vaccinated but less than 1% of people who have been vaccinated have reported adverse side effects (CDC VAERS data, hard to link, ~435,000 adverse reports and about 347 million doses given, basically 00.1% of all cases).  It appears to be effective based on the decline of the original variant, but that’s anecdotal.</p>
<p>If you understand how viruses work, are convinced by the evidence that supports the statements above, and don’t have a history of reactions to other vaccines, there’s really no reason to avoid the vaccine.</p>

        <p>Hey, thank you for coming in with a reasonable post against the flak you'll receive. You are right, of course, and what I've been trying to do is separate the politics and the vitriol from the reality. The stats you give tend to add up from what I've seen, all I know enough people who have gotten vaccinated now and they've been mostly ok. One worry looking is the 1 in 1,000 rate of Bell's Palsy, and also the threat of unknown side-effects further down the line.</p>
<p>Even with all the pressure, coercion, harassment and insults, and the reasonable assumption that since the vulnerable are essentially all vaccinated anyway why do I as a 35 year old need to(?), there's still a decent chance I will decide to get vaccinated in the near future. I'd get two shots, but not any boosters. I still wouldn't go along with the vaccine passport.</p>
<p>Being around older and more vulnerable people lately, it has been playing on my conscience, and I thank you for offering a balanced view, as the most hardcore provax people have been coming off as unhinged as 5G lizard vax folks. Thankfully this sub is mostly reasonable hesitancy and refusal simply on grounds of the coercion.</p>

        <p>I think the biggest threat is the unknown down the road. There’s no way of knowing, there hasn’t been enough time. However, the same thing is true about covid’s long term side effects. Personally, I think that point is a wash since there are unknowns either way.</p>
<p>Do you get the flu shot? The flu is a corona virus; we need a booster every year. This isn’t going to be any different, most likely. As for vaccine passports, Americans have almost universally been vaccinated as part of being allowed to go to public schools for decades. Vaccine passports already exist and have existed for a long time. Their tyrannical effect is widely overblown; most people already carry government issued IDs without protest. Think about it this way, people already have to show their ID to order a beer. I mean, you have to vaccinate your dog before taking it to most kennels for short term boarding. None of this is new; there are people who make a lot of money scaring people about threats to freedom just like there are people who make a lot of money scaring people about a virus.</p>
<p>You mentioned the flak I will take from this place. It just goes to show you that the real threat to freedom comes from ideology on both sides. Most of the people on both sides are absolutely convinced the other side is both wrong and sinister; hardly anyone is asking why their side is right.</p>

        <p>Hey, thank you for coming in with a reasonable post against the flak you'll receive. You are right, of course, and what I've been trying to do is separate the politics and the vitriol from the reality. The stats you give tend to add up from what I've seen, all I know enough people who have gotten vaccinated now and they've been mostly ok. One worry looking is the 1 in 1,000 rate of Bell's Palsy, and also the threat of unknown side-effects further down the line.</p>
<p>Even with all the pressure, coercion, harassment and insults, and the reasonable assumption that since the vulnerable are essentially all vaccinated anyway why do I as a 35 year old need to(?), there's still a decent chance I will decide to get vaccinated in the near future. I'd get two shots, but not any boosters. I still wouldn't go along with the vaccine passport.</p>
<p>Being around older and more vulnerable people lately, it has been playing on my conscience, and I thank you for offering a balanced view, as the most hardcore provax people have been coming off as unhinged as 5G lizard vax folks. Thankfully this sub is mostly reasonable hesitancy and refusal simply on grounds of the coercion.</p>

<p>You mentioned the flak I will take from this place. Right now I’m sitting at 7 down votes, but with no real conversation saying why I’m wrong. It just goes to show you that the real threat to freedom comes from ideology on both sides. Most of the people on both sides are absolutely convinced the other side is both wrong and sinister; hardly anyone is asking why their side is right.</p>

        <p>You make some decent points, thank you for making them. Unknowns either way is just a good a case for skepticism. I don't get the flu shot yet, although would consider it if I were older. Is the flu not an influenza virus rather than a coronavirus?</p>
<p>I do have to draw the line with vax passports, especially the fervour to prevent people from even entering supermarkets without one, that's messed up. I personally don't think the arguments you make quite well are comparable on those forms of ID, although I can see where you get the precedent. I'm in the UK, so what we need ID for is slightly different. It worries me the idea that people can be prevented from basic services without being confirmed sick, so in many cases it can become segregation of the healthy. The presupposition of a person's freedom to participate in social/cultural activities AT ALL based on health status is a very new thing outside of China. Yes, you need an ID to get alcohol if you look under a certain age, but that's not based on someone's health status, and they can also order a water instead - a vax passport prevents the person from having a choice.</p>
<p>What gets me in the UK is that from September you can only get into a nightclub with a vaccine, but they won't let people show a negative test or an immunity certificate, so since covid can still spread AND they're not testing, that says to me folks are willing to turn a blind eye to the spread of covid so they can go to large events, unknown who might be spreading it. At that point, it's the vaccinated people attending these and larger events who will be responsible for the spread rather than a non-vaccinated person who could not be infected and has been rejected. It seems very backwards to me that it can be ok to be an infected vaccinated person, very an unvaccinated healthy person is segregated from public life with no viable precedent.</p>
<p>There's also the serious likelihood of function creep with these passes that disturbs me no end. By the rationale you've presented, people could be forced into really inhumane situations in the name of public health. </p>
<p>I definitely agree with you that a problem with modern discourse is a lack of critical analysis on both sides, and Socratic method. While we fight, the elites are cleaning up off all our backs, and I doubt they care how we die as much as they claim to.</p>
