    <strong>My dispair</strong>
    <p><p>I am a minor and my parents are likely going to force me to get the vaccine. </p>
<p>While I am a very esoteric yet analytical person they however simply do what they are told and when I tell them the truth and support it with factual information they get angry.</p>
<p>How can I prevent them from making me get the vaccine?</p>
<p>Countless times I have showcased empirical,numerical and scientific evidence that blatantly deconstructs their perceptions.</p>
<p>This sounds rather dramatic but I feel my very humanity to be at stake. If you inject non human DNA into the physical body of a human </p>
<p>Who knows what that could do to the soul.</p></p>

        <p>First of all, thank god you’re awake!! Congrats on that young friend! You’re a rare and precious gem and we need you! Secondly, Do NOT consent to ANY vaccine. Ever. While you may be a minor, you still have rights. Your parents cannot make this choice for you. Continue trying to educate them and your peers and friends.</p>

        <p>your humanity and soul are at stake that's for sure. your goal is to be free of beliefs and perceptions that are making you feel as though you are being forced. this is about taking back your free will and claiming your right as a sovereign soul/being. if that means walking away from everything, that's what you must do</p>

        <p>It's hard because we spend so much effort time and energy into trying to convince others of what we know is truth or trying to raise their consciousness level, which is impossible. We need to put that energy into ourselves instead, and if we do only a fraction, and stop letting these people act as a power sink for us, draining the life force energy and passion away, ultimately. Doing so can propel us forward very quickly into a new situation; this is how to escape and create something new when it seems impossible. It's not impossible, it only seems that way because of the programs currently running. We are all going to be facing situations and choices soon that before seemed like impossibilities, and if you are strong in spirit, and clear of programs that don't serve, your nature will take care of the rest.</p>

        <p>i'm sorry, that is awful. have you told them you do not consent to this? from my experience saying "i do not consent" has a tendency to make people realize they're in the wrong when debate/ explanation fails. </p>
<p>also i haven't researched this too much, but possibly worth looking into if you have not already --  i believe the  Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is not a mRNA vaccine. i think if i were forced to be vaccinated at some point i would look into trying to get that one.</p>

        <p>I know that the different vaccines are very different functionally simply because one has to be kept cold while the other does not.</p>
<p>Ive brought this up to my parents. Why would two types of the same vaccine for the same virus developed at the same time be so chemically different that they have to be kept at completely different tempatures?</p>

<p>how in any way are you qualified to even understand the mechanisms of vaccines, their development, the different approaches...  and why the fuck would your parents know this?  They aren't microbiologists, or immunologists and neither are you.  I've got 6 PHD chemistry professors and doctors in my family.  We talk about this, they have a level of understanding that would take you decades to even understand.  Do you get it? some things you can't know or understand from a 10 second google sweep, unless you're reading and believing the webpages of hysteric idiots.  As brief as I can, the two major types of vaccines made for this are from two very different approaches, one old, one new</p>
<p>they litrerally are different in how they attack the virus, and that's one reason why 'the storage temperatures are different'</p>
<p>Don't go spreading the virus to anyone especially vulnerable, a grandparent, for example.  Go and get the vaccine when you can.  I wish my family could get it quickly, I cannot visit my elderly parents with their grand-daughter (who they haven't met in person yet even after more than one year) until we do.</p>
<p>But like any typical 13-year old, you're only thinking of your 'freedom' and how your parents are 'controlling' you</p>

        <p>I advice you and the commenters below to keep their religious ramblings at bay;</p>
<p>There's only one thing you can do, just stomp your foot and beg them not to force you as you're their child. It will be extremely hard for <em>good</em> parents to go through with it if they risk their child resenting them for their choice. Oh and another thing, don't necessarily say you won't get the vaccine ever; say you would rather simply wait a bit. Because if you are a minor as you say (which I doubt), then you're in no real position to actually resist sadly.</p>
