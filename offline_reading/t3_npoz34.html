    <strong>How would one protect and detox from the vac?</strong>
    <p><p>I’m not spelling the “V” word fully because my main reddit account got deleted for posting “anti-v” links.</p>
<p>So at this moment I don’t really have a choice whether to get it or not. I’m still in high school, not able to travel because of lockdown, and barely any savings, and plus I live in a small town in the middle of nowhere. There are a few people who got really sick or died soon after getting the vac, but local news is saying it was the virus. It’s like everyone here is brainwashed into thinking that there is no possibility at all that these people got sick/died because of the vac.</p>
<p>My two options are get the vac because my whole family and pretty much everyone in this town is pro-vac, or be homeless.</p>
<p>Please let me know ways I can’t protect myself before and after the vac.</p></p>

        <p>Being homeless isn't really that bad as long as you can lay your head down somewhere at night, such as a car. Can you contact a resource or friend of any kind? You need to consider what other options you have. Seriously this is not something to play with. If your relatives dont see the seriousness of this experiment than you should look out for yourself. You have your own life to live sweetie.</p>

        <p>That's a fucking tough one, man, I feel for you. </p>
<p>The only real option you have is to try and fake a vaxx card and just say you got it during school hours. </p>
<p>It's so, so hard to hide things in a small town though. That's really tough. </p>
<p>You might not have a solution other than to seek a lawyer and find out what options you have. If they can let kids get the jab without parental consent, surely it should go both ways. Your parents shouldn't be able to force you either.</p>

        <p>I can’t fake it because my parents already booked for us to get the vax at the same time. My extended family already got both doses, since most of them work in healthcare, so there’s nothing I could say that would change their minds. It’d be a living hell being with people who think i’m putting them in danger by not getting the vac, even though I live a much healthier lifestyle.</p>

        <p>God damn, man. This made me sad as fuck. </p>
<p>You got a good head on your shoulders though, man. Keep on your path. </p>
<p>Look, it's totally possible that the vaccine will be largely safe long term. There's just no way we could possibly know yet. But <em>hopefully</em> it will be, and this won't be more than a quick jab to your arm and a weird memory. </p>
<p>You can absolutely be forgiven if you don't think that's likely, but for you and everyone else, I hope it ends up being okay.</p>

        <p>I get what you are saying, but have you seen how people are reacting to all of it?</p>
<p>And I'm talking offline. Kids getting bullied, parents throwing kids out of their home, I've seen discussion of divorce over this issue.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I understand your sentiment, but if you cannot "imagine it" then you haven't noticed all the sideline crap going on.</p>
<p>Prior to COVID there were plenty of stories of "My house, my rules", I can't imagine that the same narrative won't be used for forcing a kid to get vaccinated. And to be totally fair, the reverse can be applied to kids who got the vaccine against the parents wishes and will be out on the street because "We don't want your spiked protein shedding on us and making us sick!"</p>
<p>I love my kids, and I can't imagine a scenario where I would put them out on the street (even when they are being a normal teen and I'd like to throw them out the window), but I can totally see other people doing it for one reason or another (not that I consider it valid in any way).</p>

        <p>That is shit dude. But you have to enforce your boundaries. Maybe the vaccine is harmless and the government has been hiding covid-19s China's genetically engineered virus' worst effects from us to not scare the populace, but it seems like this is not the case. Maybe it is time to strike out on your own, and maybe this will make them realize that they are doing something horrible by pressuring you into unnecessary medical procedures. There are lots of resources for homeless youth, take a look before you commit</p>

        <p>See, the difference between you and I, is i read studies, reports, and scientific journals, so its not my opinion. Its fact. And science can change and I accept that, but studies have shown the vaccine is both safe and effective as of now, and the future.</p>

        <p>And after reading carefully it seems that the staff/people commenting ate anti Semitic. On top of that I have sources that say Peter is spreading misinformation. You might say that is censorship but in reality it's not.</p>

        <p>Please provide the source(s).</p>
<p>And no, censorship is when you close the account of the mRNA creator on twitter after he said that the method used in the vaccine is wrong.</p>
<p>Censorship is when you get banned after asking since the WHO changed the cycle count due to too many false positives shouldn't the original numbers be reevaluated.</p>
<p>Censorship is after a person gets the vaccine and feels like shit people tell them "Suck it up buttercup."</p>
<p>Censorship is banning treatments that have been proven effective for 75 years in favor of a vaccine that at best has been created in the last two years.</p>
<p>Censorship is telling someone to "Shut up and just do it" when they ask why.</p>
