    <strong>I worked at a vaccination centre for 2 weeks to see what is was like</strong>
    <p><p>My older brother owns 3 vaccination centres. He makes £10 for every single person who comes in for their vaccination, and on Thursday/Friday/Saturday/Sunday, it is particularly busy so he needed extra staff/volunteers and he took me along to help speed up the queue. </p>
<p>I was on admin doing the screening before each shot and my cousin was jabbing. There were many rooms each with a screener and a jabber. Both me and my cousin are unvaccinated and I’m slowly waking him up as each day passes.</p>
<p>Let me tell you half the people who entered genuinely looked deterred and as if they had been coerced. Some talked about just wanting it to be over and how they feel their life is stagnating and they knew the Gov wouldn’t stop and they believed they would do all they could to make sure everyone is vaccinated. For them it was inevitable and they didn’t see any way out, essentially they got fed up and needed it for job purposes and going abroad etc. The other half, of which it seemed like a decent handful were misinformed, a few people believed there was a 2 - 5% death rate and one idiot even said “isn’t it like 20% or something” clearly have done no research into COVID whatsoever. The rest of this half either didn’t mind or encouraged vaccinations, even met a few vaccine fanatics who despised those not wanting to get it.</p>
<p>I also witnessed three people who collapsed shortly after the jab. One of which was a big 6’5 black guy built like an athlete who looked to be in his 20s, poor guy hit the deck so hard, the whole centre heard the thud yet they didn’t walk away or even question what happened, carrying on like drones going in one by one. </p>
<p>Life feels like it’s going to be pretty shitty from now on.</p></p>

        <p>Keep in mind that the fainting almost certainly has nothing to do with what's inside the syringe and is probably more of a psychological effect.</p>

        <p>No, it is from what is in the syringe, i.e. the CLOTSHOT making clots in your brain and the rest of your body.</p>
<p>Numerous doctors have already documented that in ALL their patients who have gotten these clotshots, they have SOME degree of clotting.</p>

        <p>Interesting.  Where can I see that data.  Out of the many people I know who have gotten both types, nobody has mentioned anything like that.</p>
<p>My understanding is that it's considered rare but it really doesn't matter at this point because almost everybody I know already got it so it is what it is.  The story months ago when I was following more closely was that it was the combination of a particular blood thinner that caused the deadly reaction but I'd imagine more is known at this point because this was well before the myocarditis was even acknowledged.</p>
<p>Going back to what you said though, I question that because from what I've heard it takes a number of hours for the side effects to start.</p>
