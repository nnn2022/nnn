    <strong>I’m emotionally exhausted.</strong>
    <p><p>I’ve always lacked empathy and feelings like that. I care about people who are close to me, but that’s about it. After all this COVID bullshit, it’s even harder. I guess this is more of a personal thing for me because of my circumstances. My fiancé’s parents are old and need to be taken care of. They go between our house and being with the rest of his siblings. My MIL has dementia and it’s not her fault she got it, but my FIL’s situation could be completely avoided. He was a lifelong smoker and never took his blood pressure medication. He had a stroke last January. He took care of my MIL until the stroke. He refuses to do rehabilitation work. He put us all in a position to have to take care of both of them. </p>
<p>I know my situation is definitely not the same as everyone else, but can you see why I lack empathy for old people? It’s hard for me to care. I never had grandparents growing up and now this we have to deal with his parents. It’s worn me down emotionally. I’m twenty-five. I have my whole life ahead of me. I can’t stand these lockdowns to protect the old when quite frankly, I don’t care. I can’t change that. I can’t change my experiences that have led to dislike old people. Hell, my fiancé is forty and he has a lot of time left. I don’t want him to be wasting time either. I want to do more things with him but we can’t because of all this BS. </p>
<p>It’s hard for me to care about people who were 400 pounds and died of COVID. I was overweight once. It was hard to lose the weight. I thought I couldn’t do it. Now I eat well and work out five or six days a week. I look good and feel great. I understand that losing weight is hard. It’s very difficult and I have empathy for people who are actively trying to change their lifestyle. If a person dies of COVID that was living an unhealthy life and never changed, I don’t really care that much. This doesn’t even apply for just overweight, it can be for smokers or drinkers.</p>
<p>I know, I’m a horrible person, but at this point I don’t really care. I used to not like being called selfish, but now I don’t care. No one knows my situation. No one knows how absolutely drained I am emotionally. I know this is just rambling on but I hope someone understands.</p></p>

        <p>As someone who used to work at a nursing home, I can tell you this:</p>
<p>Never feel sad about old people dying. They have lived long and happy lives, and many of these people are confined to wheelchairs or bed bound, and often can’t even use the bathroom without help. They are not living life to the fullest anymore. It can be heartbreaking to see them deteriorate. Our job at nursing homes is not to save their lives, but to make the end of their lives as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of DNR? It stands for “do not resuscitate”. Basically if a DNR has heart failure, just let it happen and let them go peacefully. Don’t try to save them. The VAST MAJORITY of residents at the nursing home I worked at were DNRs, requested by the families. These people were on the very last leg and if it happened, it happened. It was all about letting them go peacefully.</p>
<p>Don’t EVER let someone tell you you’re a bad person for not being upset at the elderly dying. In a world where we live so long, we fear death. The fact is, every single person on this planet will die and it’s best to go at an old age. It’s not a tragedy when an old person dies.</p>
<p>The only thing tragic about the elderly dying of covid was that their families were not allowed to be by their side.</p>

        <p>I used to work in a nursing home and I 100% agree with you. I couldn't tell you how many times I was passing meds and elderly patients would outright tell me that they already fulfilled and lived their lives and wished to pass, it was a daily thing.</p>

        <p>I'm generally a pretty empathetic person, and these lockdowns have drained all the empathy from me. Once I saw how cruel, selfish, and utterly brainless people can be, I began feeling nothing but contempt for them.</p>

        <p>&rt; . No one knows how absolutely drained I am emotionally.  </p>
<p>Is anyone supposed to give half a damn?</p>
<p>You spent a whole post explaining how you don't care about anyone because everything is all their fault and you are obviously better than them, you lost weight, you don't smoke, so none of this stuff will ever touch you and why should you waste a moment caring about them.</p>
<p>You got yourself into your depressive, maudlin mindset and your life situation. I'm not in your situation. I could not care less.</p>

        <p>And I'm being honest when I say I couldn't care less about some deeply immature ridiculous whiner who is on about their "emotional exhaustion" while simultaneously talking about how everyone else's problems are all their own fault and they'll never have those things happen! That's a level of juvenile that's hard to take from teenagers, who you expect it from.</p>
